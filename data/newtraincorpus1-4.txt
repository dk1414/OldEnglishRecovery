valkyria of the battlefield <num> commonly referred to as valkyria chronicles iii outside japan is a tactical role @-@ playing video game developed by sega and media
vision for the playstation portable
released in january <year> in japan it is the third game in the valkyria series
employing the same fusion of tactical and real @-@ time gameplay as its predecessors the story runs parallel to the first game and follows the nameless a penal military unit serving the nation of gallia during the second europan war who perform secret black operations and are pitted against the imperial unit calamaty raven
the game began development in <year> carrying over a large portion of the work done on valkyria chronicles ii
while it retained the standard features of the series it also underwent multiple adjustments such as making the game more forgiving for series newcomers
character designer raita honjou and composer hitoshi sakimoto both returned from previous entries along with valkyria chronicles ii director takeshi ozawa
a large team of writers handled the script
the game 's opening theme was sung by may 'n
it met with positive sales in japan and was praised by both japanese and western critics
after release it received downloadable content along with an expanded edition in november of that year
it was also adapted into manga and an original video animation series
due to low sales of valkyria chronicles ii valkyria chronicles iii was not localized but a fan translation compatible with the game 's expanded edition was released in <year>
media
vision would return to the franchise with the development of valkyria azure revolution for the playstation <num>
stories are told through comic book @-@ like panels with animated character portraits with characters speaking partially through voiced speech bubbles and partially through unvoiced text
the player progresses through a series of linear missions gradually unlocked as maps that can be freely scanned through and replayed as they are unlocked
the route to each story location on the map varies depending on an individual player 's approach when one option is selected the other is sealed off to the player
outside missions the player characters rest in a camp where units can be customized and character growth occurs
alongside the main story missions are character @-@ specific sub missions relating to different squad members
after the game 's completion additional episodes are unlocked some of them having a higher difficulty than those found in the rest of the game
there are also love simulation elements related to the game 's two main heroines although they take a very minor role
the game 's battle system the blitz system is carried over directly from valkyira chronicles
during missions players select each unit using a top @-@ down perspective of the battlefield map once a character is selected the player moves the character around the battlefield in third @-@ person
a character can only act once per @-@ turn but characters can be granted multiple turns at the expense of other characters turns
each character has a field and distance of movement limited by their action gauge
up to nine characters can be assigned to a single mission
during gameplay characters will call out if something happens to them such as their health points hp getting low or being knocked out by enemy attacks
each character has specific potentials skills unique to each character
they are divided into personal potential which are innate skills that remain unaltered unless otherwise dictated by the story and can either help or impede a character and battle potentials which are grown throughout the game and always grant boons to a character
to learn battle potentials each character has a unique masters table a grid @-@ based skill table that can be used to acquire and link different skills
characters also have special abilities that grant them temporary boosts on the battlefield kurt can activate direct command and move around the battlefield without depleting his action point gauge the character reila can shift into her valkyria form and become invincible while imca can target multiple enemy units with her heavy weapon
troops are divided into five classes scouts shocktroopers engineers lancers and armored soldier
troopers can switch classes by changing their assigned weapon
changing class does not greatly affect the stats gained while in a previous class
with victory in battle experience points are awarded to the squad which are distributed into five different attributes shared by the entire squad a feature differing from early games method of distributing to different unit types
gallian army squad <num> also known as the nameless are a penal military unit composed of criminals foreign deserters and military offenders whose real names are erased from the records and thereon officially referred to by numbers
ordered by the gallian military to perform the most dangerous missions that the regular army and militia will not do they are nevertheless up to the task exemplified by their motto altaha abilia meaning always ready
the three main characters are no
<num> kurt irving an army officer falsely accused of treason who wishes to redeem himself ace no
<num> imca a female darcsen heavy weapons specialist who seeks revenge against the valkyria who destroyed her home and no
<num> riela marcellis a seemingly jinxed young woman who is unknowingly a descendant of the valkyria
together with their fellow squad members these three are tasked to fight against a mysterious imperial unit known as calamity raven consisting of mostly darcsen soldiers
as the nameless officially do not exist the upper echelons of the gallian army exploit the concept of plausible deniability in order to send them on missions that would otherwise make gallia lose face in the war
while at times this works to their advantage such as a successful incursion into imperial territory other orders cause certain members of the <num> great distress
one such member gusurg becomes so enraged that he abandons his post and defects into the ranks of calamity raven attached to the ideal of darcsen independence proposed by their leader dahau
at the same time elements within gallian army command move to erase the nameless in order to protect their own interests
hounded by both allies and enemies and combined with the presence of a traitor within their ranks the <num> desperately move to keep themselves alive while at the same time fight to help the gallian war effort
this continues until the nameless 's commanding officer ramsey crowe who had been kept under house arrest is escorted to the capital city of randgriz in order to present evidence exonerating the weary soldiers and expose the real traitor the gallian general that had accused kurt of treason
partly due to these events and partly due to the major losses in manpower gallia suffers towards the end of the war with the empire the nameless are offered a formal position as a squad in the gallian army rather than serve as an anonymous shadow force
this is short @-@ lived however as following maximilian 's defeat dahau and calamity raven move to activate an ancient valkyrian super weapon within the empire kept secret by their benefactor
without the support of maximilian or the chance to prove themselves in the war with gallia it is dahau 's last trump card in creating a new darcsen nation
as an armed gallian force invading the empire just following the two nations cease @-@ fire would certainly wreck their newfound peace kurt decides to once again make his squad the nameless asking crowe to list himself and all under his command as killed @-@ in @-@ action
now owing allegiance to none other than themselves the <num> confronts dahau and destroys the valkyrian weapon
each member then goes their separate ways in order to begin their lives anew
the director of valkyria chronicles ii takeshi ozawa returned to that role for valkyria chronicles iii
development work took approximately one year
after the release of valkyria chronicles ii the staff took a look at both the popular response for the game and what they wanted to do next for the series
like its predecessor valkyria chronicles iii was developed for playstation portable this was due to the team wanting to refine the mechanics created for valkyria chronicles ii and they had not come up with the revolutionary idea that would warrant a new entry for the playstation <num>
speaking in an interview it was stated that the development team considered valkyria chronicles iii to be the series first true sequel while valkyria chronicles ii had required a large amount of trial and error during development due to the platform move the third game gave them a chance to improve upon the best parts of valkyria chronicles ii due to being on the same platform
in addition to sega staff from the previous games development work was also handled by media
vision
the original scenario was written kazuki yamanobe while the script was written by hiroyuki fujii koichi majima kishiko miyagi seiki nagakawa and takayuki shouji
its story was darker and more somber than that of its predecessor
the majority of material created for previous games such as the blitz system and the design of maps was carried over
alongside this improvements were made to the game 's graphics and some elements were expanded such as map layouts mission structure and the number of playable units per mission
a part of this upgrade involved creating unique polygon models for each character 's body
in order to achieve this the cooperative elements incorporated into the second game were removed as they took up a large portion of memory space needed for the improvements
they also adjusted the difficulty settings and ease of play so they could appeal to new players while retaining the essential components of the series gameplay
the newer systems were decided upon early in development
the character designs were done by raita honjou who had worked on the previous valkyria chronicles games
when creating the nameless squad honjou was faced with the same problem he had had during the first game the military uniforms essentially destroyed character individuality despite him needing to create unique characters the player could identify while maintaining a sense of reality within the valkyria chronicles world
the main color of the nameless was black
as with the previous valkyria games valkyria chronicles iii used the canvas graphics engine
the anime opening was produced by production i
g
when he originally heard about the project he thought it would be a light tone similar to other valkyria chronicles games but found the themes much darker than expected
an early theme he designed around his original vision of the project was rejected
he redid the main theme about seven times through the music production due to this need to reassess the game
the main theme was initially recorded using orchestra then sakimoto removed elements such as the guitar and bass then adjusted the theme using a synthesizer before redoing segments such as the guitar piece on their own before incorporating them into the theme
the rejected main theme was used as a hopeful tune that played during the game 's ending
the battle themes were designed around the concept of a modern battle divorced from a fantasy scenario by using modern musical instruments constructed to create a sense of atonality
while sakimoto was most used to working with synthesized music he felt that he needed to incorporate live instruments such as orchestra and guitar
the guitar was played by mitsuhiro ohta who also arranged several of the later tracks
the game 's opening theme song if you wish for
もしも君が願うのなら moshimo kimi ga negauno nara was sung by japanese singer may 'n
its theme was the reason soldiers fought in particular their wish to protect what was precious to them rather than a sense of responsibility or duty
its lyrics were written by seiko fujibayashi who had worked on may 'n on previous singles
in its september issue famitsu listed that senjō no valkyria <num> would be arriving on the playstation portable
its first public appearance was at the <year> tokyo game show tgs where a demo was made available for journalists and attendees
during the publicity story details were kept scant so as not to spoil too much for potential players along with some of its content still being in flux at the time of its reveal
to promote the game and detail the story leading into the game 's events an episodic flash visual novel written by fujii began release in january <year>
the game was released january <num> <year>
during an interview the development team said that the game had the capacity for downloadable content dlc but that no plans were finalized
multiple dlc maps featuring additional missions and recruitable characters were released between february and april <year>
an expanded edition of the game valkyria chronicles iii extra edition released on november <num> <year>
packaged and sold at a lower price than the original extra edition game with seven additional episodes three new three chosen by staff from the game 's dlc and one made available as a pre @-@ order bonus
people who also owned the original game could transfer their save data between versions
unlike its two predecessors valkyria chronicles iii was not released in the west
according to sega this was due to poor sales of valkyria chronicles ii and the general unpopularity of the psp in the west
an unofficial fan translation patch began development in february <year> players with a copy of valkyria chronicles iii could download and apply the patch which translated the game 's text into english
compatible with the extra edition the patch was released in january <year>
by early february the game sold <num> @,@ <num> units coming in second overall to the last story for the wii
by the end of the year the game had sold just over <num> @,@ <num> units
famitsu enjoyed the story and were particularly pleased with the improvements to gameplay
japanese gaming site game watch impress despite negatively noting its pacing and elements recycled from previous games was generally positive about its story and characters and found its gameplay entertaining despite off @-@ putting difficulty spikes
4gamer
net writer naohiko misuosame in a play test article based on the game 's psn demo felt that valkyria chronicles iii provided a profound feeling of closure for the valkyria chronicles series
he praised its gameplay despite annoying limitations to aspects such as special abilities and positively noted its shift in story to a tone similar to the first game
playstation official magazine uk praised the story 's blurring of gallia 's moral standing art style and most points about its gameplay positively noting the latter for both its continued quality and the tweaks to balance and content
its one major criticism were multiple difficulty spikes something that had affected the previous games
heath hindman of gaming website playstation lifestyle praised the addition of non @-@ linear elements and improvements or removal of mechanics from valkyria chronicles ii in addition to praising the returning gameplay style of previous games
he also positively noted the story 's serious tone
points criticized in the review were recycled elements awkward cutscenes that seemed to include all characters in a scene for no good reason pacing issues and occasional problems with the game 's ai
in a preview of the tgs demo ryan geddes of ign was left excited as to where the game would go after completing the demo along with enjoying the improved visuals over valkyria chronicles ii
kotaku 's richard eisenbeis was highly positive about the game citing is story as a return to form after valkyria chronicles ii and its gameplay being the best in the series
his main criticisms were its length and gameplay repetition along with expressing regret that it would not be localized
media
vision would return to the series to develop valkyria azure revolution with ozawa returning as director
azure revolution is a role @-@ playing video game for the playstation <num> that forms the beginning of a new series within the valkyria franchise
titled senjō no valkyria <num> taga tame no jūsō 戦場のヴァルキュリア３ 誰がための銃瘡 lit
valkyria of the battlefield <num> the wound taken for someone 's sake it was originally released through playstation network and qriocity between april and may <year>
the initially @-@ planned release and availability period needed to be extended due to a stoppage to psn during the early summer of that year
it later released for dvd on june <num> and august <num> <year> with separate black and blue editions being available for purchase
the anime is set during the latter half of valkyria chronicles iii detailing a mission by the nameless against their imperial rivals calamity raven
the anime was first announced in november <year>
it was developed by a @-@ <num> pictures produced by shinji motoyama directed by nobuhiro kondō and written by hiroshi ōnogi
sakimoto 's music for the game was used in the anime
the anime 's title was inspired by the principle purpose of the nameless to suffer in battle for the goals of others
a subtitle attached to the project during development was the road to kubinka which referenced the kubinka tank museum in moscow
the game 's main theme was how the characters regained their sense of self when stripped of their names and identities along with general themes focused on war and its consequences
while making the anime the production team were told by sega to make it as realistic as possible with the consequence that the team did extensive research into aspects such as what happened when vehicles like tanks were overturned or damaged
due to it being along the same timeline as the original game and its television anime adaptation the cast of valkyria chronicles could make appearances which pleased the team
the opening theme akari light -tomoshibi- 灯 @-@ tomoshibi- was sung by japanese singer faylan
the ending theme someday the flowers of light will bloom いつか咲く光の花 itsuka saku hikari no hana was sung by minami kuribayashi
both songs lyrics were written by their respective artists
two manga adaptations were produced following each of the game 's main female protagonists imca and riela
they were senjō no valkyria <num> namo naki chikai no hana 戦場のヴァルキュリア3 名もなき誓いの花 lit

arsenal building is a building located in macarthur park in downtown little rock arkansas
built in <year> it was part of little rock 's first military installation
since its decommissioning the tower building has housed two museums
it was home to the arkansas museum of natural history and antiquities from <year> to <year> and the macarthur museum of arkansas military history since <year>
it has also been the headquarters of the little rock æsthetic club since <year>
the building receives its name from its distinct octagonal tower
besides being the last remaining structure of the original little rock arsenal and one of the oldest buildings in central arkansas it was also the birthplace of general douglas macarthur who became the supreme commander of us forces in the south pacific during world war ii
it was also the starting place of the camden expedition
in <year> it was named as one of the top <num> attractions in the state of arkansas by arkansas
com
thirty @-@ six acres were appropriated on the outskirts of little rock by major robert b
lee of the u
s
army
the land had been previously used as a racetrack by the local jockey club
john wormley walker a builder for the federal government supervised the construction
originally <num> @,@ <num> was allocated for the construction of the arsenal but proved inadequate
the budget was later increased to <num> @,@ <num>
work began on the tower building in <year> and it was the first permanent structure of the arsenal to be built
being originally constructed to store ammunition the building was designed with <num> @-@ foot @-@ thick <num>
<num> m exterior walls
the original plans called for it to be built of stone however masonry was used instead
the arkansas gazette referred to the structure as a splendid specimen of masonry
but in november <year> with the american civil war on the horizon a company of the second united states artillery consisting of sixty @-@ five men was transferred to little rock under the command of captain james totten
on january <num> <year> the state legislature decided to hold a referendum to determine if a state convention should be held to consider the issue of secession and to elect delegates to such a convention
it was planned for february <num> however events at the arsenal would not wait
on january <num> then governor henry massey rector informed captain totten that he and his soldiers would be permitted to remain in the possession of the federal officers until the state by authority of the people shall have determined to sever their connection with the general government totten responded to this by telling the governor that his orders came from the united states government and began a desperate but ultimately futile dispatch of letters and telegrams asking for reinforcements although rumors were widely spread that they were already coming
the first telegraph wire to span between little rock and memphis had recently been completed
local attorney john m harrel was asked to compose the first telegraph dispatched from arkansas 's capital
in his message harrel reported unconfirmed rumors that more federal troops had been sent to reinforce the little rock arsenal
the united states troops at the outposts of the western frontier of the state and in the indian nation have all been recalled from winter quarters to reinforce the garrison at fort smith
the garrison at fort smith had been previously transferred to the united states arsenal in this city little rock
the arsenal is one of the richest depositories of military stores in the united states and is supposed to be the ultimate destination of the tropps sic ordered from the frontier
-john m harrel telegram january <num> <year> the item was intended simply as a piece of news but telegraph lines quickly spread the news throughout the state fueling procession sentiment
the rumor was interpreted by some arkansans as a call from the governor to assemble to help expel the federal troops from the arsenal
by february <num> six militia units consisting of <num> @,@ <num> men with a guarantee that the numbers could be increased to <num> @,@ <num> if the situations deemed it necessary had assembled in little rock
governor rector vehemently denied ordering the troops to assemble or giving any order at all in connection with the troops
faced with the fact that the military had assembled believing they were following his orders and the consensus of the citizens of little rock against any armed conflict between the civilian army and federal troops governor rector was forced to take control of the situation
on february <num> he sent a formal demand for surrender of the arsenal to captain totten this movement is prompted by the feeling that pervades the citizens of this state that in the present emergency the arms and munitions of war in the arsenal should be under the control of the state authorities in order to their security
this movement although not authorized by me has assumed such an aspect that it becomes my duty as the executive of this sate to interpose my official authority to prevent a collision between the people of the state and the federal troops under your command
i therefore demand in the name of the state the delivery of the possession of the arsenal and munitions of war under your charge to the state authorities to be held subject to the action of the convention to be held on the <num> of march next
perhaps because abraham lincoln had not yet been inaugurated as president captain totten received no instructions from his superiors and was forced to withdraw his troops
he agreed to surrender the arsenal as long as the governor agreed to three provisions the governor would take possession of the arsenal in the name of the united states
the soldiers would be allowed safe passage in any direction carrying any personal and public property besides munitions of war
the soldiers would be allowed to march away as men leaving under orders not as conquered and surrendering soldiers
on the morning of february <num> <year> rector and totten signed an agreement placing the arsenal in the hands of state officials
that afternoon the citizen militia marched to the arsenal with governor rector at its head
all of the federal troops had left at this point except totten who had stayed behind to listen to the governor 's speech and to hand the arsenal over in person
the little rock arsenal was classified in <year> as an arsenal of deposit meaning that it was simply a warehouse for the storage of weapons intended for the use of the state militia in times of crisis
thus there were no substantial operations for ordnance fabrication or repairs nor for the manufacture of cartridges at the time the arsenal fell into state hands
most of these operations were started from scratch through the efforts of the arkansas military board
inside the little rock arsenal after its seizure in february <year> the confederates inventoried some <num> @,@ <num> weapons <num> @,@ <num> musket cartridges and <num> @,@ <num> percussion caps as well as the four bronze cannon of totten 's battery
long arms in the arsenal 's inventory consisted of <num>
<num> cal flintlock <num> @,@ <num> <num>
<num> cal percussion @-@ converted <num> <num>
<num> cal smoothbore percussion <num> <num>
<num> cal rifle @-@ muskets <num> <num> common rifles <num> <num> rifle mississippi rifle <num> <num> musketoon <num> hall 's carbines <num> hall 's rifles flintlock <num> @,@ <num> total <num> @,@ <num> of this number approximately <num> weapons were serviceable or ready @-@ for @-@ issue
note there were only <num> @,@ <num> percussion weapons available
disposition of the weapons found in the arsenal is somewhat sketchy but from various records it can be surmised that the <num> <num> <num> and <num> arkansas infantry regiments mustered in june <year> were issued <num> <num>
<num> caliber flintlocks
the <num> and <num> arkansas four companies of kelly 's <num> arkansas battalion and the <num> arkansas cavalry regiment were issued flintlock hall 's rifles
the units comprising the infantry force of van dorn 's army of the west were the 1st and <num> arkansas mounted rifles were also armed with <num> flintlocks from the little rock arsenal
by the time the <num> and <num> arkansas infantry regiments mustered in at little rock the supply of arms had been almost completely exhausted and only old junker weapons were left
most of the equipment arms and machinery at the little rock arsenal was removed to east of the mississippi river by order of maj
gen
earl van dorn in april and may <year> and accountability for it is lost at that point
by all appearances the equipment was sent down the river to napoleon arkansas and from there to jackson mississippi where it was probably destroyed during the vicksburg campaign in the early summer of <year>
major general thomas c
hindman sent to command the district of arkansas in may <year> found the state nearly destitute of military material
hindman established another armory at arkadelphia and revived the little rock arsenal as a collection point and depot for armaments and ammunition manufacture for small arms
hindman recorded machinery was made for manufacturing percussion caps and small arms and both were turned out in small quantity but of excellent quality
lead mines were opened and worked and a chemical laboratory was established and successfully operated in aid of the ordnance department and in the manufacture of calomel castor oil spirits of nitre the various tinctures of iron and other valuable medicines
most of these works were located at or near arkadelphia on the ouachita river <num> miles south from little rock
the tools machinery and the material were gathered piecemeal or else made by hand labor
nothing of this sort had been before attempted on government account in arkansas to my knowledge except for the manufacture of small arms the machinery for which was taken away by general van dorn and there was neither capital nor sufficient enterprise among the citizens to engage in such undertakings � a further supply along with lead and caps was procured from the citizens of little rock and vicinity by donation purchases and impressments
this ammunition and that which i brought with me was rapidly prepared for use at the laboratory established at the little rock arsenal for that purpose
as illustrating as the pitiful scarcity of material in the country the fact may be stated that it was found necessary to use public documents of the state library for cartridge paper
gunsmiths were employed or conscripted tools purchased or impressed and the repair of the damaged guns i brought with me and about an equal number found at little rock commenced at once
but after inspecting the work and observing the spirit of the men i decided that a garrison <num> strong could hold out against fitch and that i would lead the remainder about <year> to gen 'l rust as soon as shotguns and rifles could be obtained from little rock instead of pikes and lances with which most of them were armed
two days elapsed before the change could be effected
the confederate ordnance establishment at little rock was reactivated in august <year>
looking around for a suitable person to head this activity general hindman turned to the confederate navy and borrowed lieutenant john w
dunnington
lt
dunnington was the commander of the gunboat c
s
s
ponchartrain which had been brought to little rock in hopes of converting it to an ironclad
dunnington was selected to head the ordnance works at little rock and although he continued to draw his pay from the confederate navy department he was placed in charge of all confederate ordnance activities which included artillery functions there with the rank of lieutenant colonel

a
are found in vol
<num> chapter iv of the captured rebel ordnance records and are most enlightening as to the scope of confederate ordnance activities at little rock during this crucial time
according to dunnington when i assumed command at this post all material had been removed to arkadelphia
there were no persons employed
no shops were open for repair of arms or for fabricating ammunition
material tools etc
had to be procured as well as the employment of laborers
work commenced the last part of the month
the military force at little rock under dunnington 's command consisted of four officers himself major john b

in addition to these he had <num> enlisted men and a civilian force composed of a foreman <num> clerks <num> gunsmiths for repairing small arms a laboratorian <num> laborers in the ammunition laboratory and a carpenter for making packing boxes

dunnington continued to build up his works at little rock until november <year> when captain sanford c
faulkner composer of the arkansas traveler was placed in charge of the arsenal
dunnington presumably returned to his naval duties and the ponchartrain

perhaps the most illuminating points of the above summary of work and those for following months are that the standard ammunition made was
buck ball indicating that the
<num> caliber smoothbores and shotguns remained the predominant caliber weapon in use and of this nearly one sixth or more of all small arms ammunition was still for flintlock weapons indicating that no less than a sixth of the confederate troops in this vicinity were still armed with obsolete flintlock weapons

continue at about the same pace and scale from august <year> until august <year>
appended to the summary for august <year> is the ominous notation during the last week in the month nearly all stores at the arsenal have been packed and sent to arkadelphia in obedience to orders from chief of ordnance district of arkansas
this then marks the beginning of the evacuation of ordnance activities from little rock with the city being surrendered to the advancing federal troops of frederick steele 's arkansas expedition on september <num> <year>

that site later became fort logan h
roots
all of the original buildings surrounding the tower building were demolished
this was prompted due to increased membership and a need for larger more permanent quarters
the previous year club members working with women 's organizations throughout the state raised money to furnish the arkansas building of the columbian exposition at the chicago world 's fair
at the fair 's conclusion artifacts from the exhibit were displayed in the tower building with the æsthetic club invited to meet in the columbian room
except for æsthetic club meetings the tower building remained largely unoccupied for almost fifty years and suffered significant deterioration
the æsthetic club provided much @-@ needed financial support during the period and even paid the electric bill during the great depression
the æsthetic club is still headquartered in the tower building
the tower building served as headquarters for the united confederate veterans reunion may <num> – <num> <year>
over <num> @,@ <num> civil war veterans the largest popular gathering in the history of the city up to that time attended and were housed in the building or camped in the park which had also become a popular camping area
later the building served as an armory for the arkansas national guard
in <year> the second floor of the tower building became little rock 's first public library
in <year> little rock built a fire station in the park that building is now gone
a band shell named for h

it became the new home of the arkansas museum of natural history and antiquities which had been located in little rock city hall
the museum remained in the tower building for approximately fifty @-@ five years
the area surrounding the tower building had been known as arsenal park when the first decommissioned and then later renamed city park
due to the efforts of bernie babcock however the city finally named it macarthur park in <year> in honor of douglas macarthur
in <year> the museum of science and natural history merged with the little rock children 's museum which had been located in union station to form the arkansas museum of discovery
the new museum was relocated to a historic building in the little rock river market district
the macarthur museum of arkansas military history opened on may <num> <year> in the tower building
the new museum 's goal is to educate and inform visitors about the military history of arkansas preserve the tower building honor servicemen and servicewomen of the united states and commemorate the birthplace of douglas macarthur

the team however has not competed in a match recognised by fifa the sport 's international governing body despite that organised women 's football has been played in the country since <year>
the gambia has two youth teams an under @-@ <num> side that has competed in fifa u @-@ <num> women 's world cup qualifiers and an under @-@ <num> side that withdrew from regional qualifiers for an under @-@ <num> world cup
the development of a national team faces challenges similar to those across africa although the national football association has four staff members focusing on women 's football
while the sport gained popularity worldwide in later decades the gambia 's national team only played its first game in <year>
that game was not fifa @-@ recognised
as of march <year> the team was unranked by fifa and as of the following month the gambia had not played in a fifa @-@ sanctioned match
the team has not participated in major regional and international tournaments including the women 's world cup the <year> african women 's championship or the <year> all @-@ africa games
the country did not have a fifa @-@ recognised youth national team until <year> when the gambia under @-@ <num> women 's team competed in confederation of african football qualifiers for the fifa u @-@ <num> world cup to be held in azerbaijan in september <year>
the gambia had fielded an under @-@ <num> team of <num> players narrowed from an initial pool of <num> young women
two girls from the sos children ’ s village bakoteh were chosen as a members of the team
the gambia first played sierra leone in a pair of qualifying matches for the tournament
gambia won the first match <num> @-@ <num> in banjul the gambia 's capital
the return match was delayed in for <num> hours and played in makeni
the gambia beat sierra leone <num> @-@ <num> to qualify for the final round
the gambia then beat tunisia <num> @-@ <num> at home and won <num> @-@ <num> in tunisia
adama tamba and awa demba scored the gambia 's goals
tunisia 's only goal was a gambian own goal
the win qualified gambia for the <year> azerbaijan world cup
the gambia also has an under @-@ <num> team that was to play in the african women 's u @-@ <num> championship in <year>
the gambia 's first match was against morocco but the team withdrew from the competition
funding is another issue impacting the game in africa where most financial assistance comes from fifa and not national football associations
another challenge is the retention of football players
many women footballers leave the continent to seek greater opportunity in europe or the united states
gambia 's national football association was founded in <year> and became affiliated with fifa in <year>
football is the most popular women 's sport in the country and was first played in an organized system in <year>
a national competition was launched in <year> the same year fifa started an education course on football for women
competition was active on both the national and scholastic levels by <year>
there are four staffers dedicated to women 's football in the gambia football association and representation of women on the board is required by the association 's charter
it is found in shallow soft @-@ bottomed habitats off northern australia
reaching <num> cm <num>
<num> in in width this species has a diamond @-@ shaped grayish green pectoral fin disc
its short whip @-@ like tail has alternating black and white bands and fin folds above and below
there are short rows of thorns on the back and the base of the tail but otherwise the skin is smooth
while this species possesses the dark mask @-@ like pattern across its eyes common to its genus it is not ornately patterned like other maskrays
benthic in nature the plain maskray feeds mainly on caridean shrimp and polychaete worms and to a lesser extent on small bony fishes
it is viviparous with females producing litters of one or two young that are nourished during gestation via histotroph uterine milk
this species lacks economic value but is caught incidentally in bottom trawls which it is thought to be less able to withstand than other maskrays due to its gracile build
as it also has a limited distribution and low fecundity the international union for conservation of nature iucn has listed it as near threatened
the specific name annotatus comes from the latin an not and notatus marked and refers to the ray 's coloration
the holotype is a male <num>
<num> cm <num>
<num> in across caught off western australia several paratypes were also designated
last tentatively placed the species in the genus dasyatis noting that it belonged to the maskray species group that also included the bluespotted stingray then dasyatis kuhlii
in <year> last and william white elevated the kuhlii group to the rank of full genus as neotrygon on the basis of morphological and molecular phylogenetic evidence
in a <year> phylogenetic analysis based on mitochondrial and nuclear dna the plain maskray and the ningaloo maskray n
ningalooensis were found to be the most basal members of neotrygon
the divergence of the n
annotata lineage was estimated to have occurred <num> ma
furthermore the individuals sequenced in the study sorted into two genetically distinct clades suggesting that n
annotata is a cryptic species complex
the two putative species were estimated to have diverged <num>
<num> ma the precipitating event was likely the splitting of the ancestral population by coastline changes
<num> – <num>
<num> times longer than wide
the leading margins of the disc are gently concave and converge at a broad angle to the pointed tip of the snout
the small eyes are placed close together and behind them are the spiracles
the nostrils are elongated and have a skirt @-@ shaped flap of skin between them
the small mouth bears prominent furrows at the corners and contains two slender papillae on the floor
small papillae are also found around the outside of the mouth
there are five pairs of gill slits
the pelvic fins are fairly large and pointed
the tail is short barely exceeding the length of the disc when intact and has a broad and flattened base leading to usually two stinging spines
after the stings the tail becomes slender and bears a long ventral fin fold and a much shorter lower dorsal fin fold
most of the body lacks dermal denticles a midline row of <num> – <num> small closely spaced thorns is present behind the spiracles and another row of <num> – <num> thorns before the stings
the dorsal coloration is grayish green becoming pinkish towards the disc margins there is a dark mask @-@ like shape around the eyes and a pair of small dark blotches behind the spiracles
the tail behind the stings has alternating black and white bands of variable width ending with black at the tip
the underside is plain white and the ventral fin fold is light grayish in color
this species grows to <num> cm <num>
<num> in across and <num> cm <num> in long
there are unsubstantiated reports that its range extends to southern papua new guinea
it is the least common of the several maskray species native to the region
this species is a bottom @-@ dweller that prefers habitats with fine sediment
it has been recorded from between <num> and <num> m <num> and <num> ft deep and tends to be found farther away from shore than other maskrays in its range
its diet consists predominantly of caridean shrimp and polychaete worms
small bony fishes are also eaten along with the occasional penaeid prawn or amphipod
larger rays consume a greater variety of prey and relatively more polychaete worms when compared to smaller rays
this species is parasitized by the tapeworm acanthobothrium jonesi
like other stingrays the plain maskray is viviparous with the developing embryos sustained to term by histotroph uterine milk produced by the mother
mature females have a single functional ovary and uterus on the left
litter size is one or two the newborns measure <num> – <num> cm <num>
<num> – <num>
<num> in across
males and females reach sexual maturity at disc widths of <num> – <num> cm <num>
<num> – <num>
<num> in and <num> – <num> cm <num>
<num> – <num>
<num> in respectively
the maximum lifespan is estimated to be <num> years for males and <num> years for females
in the present day this is mostly caused by australia 's northern prawn fishery which operates throughout its range
although this species is discarded when caught it is more delicate @-@ bodied than other maskrays and is thus unlikely to survive encounters with trawling gear
historically this species may also have been negatively affected by japanese chinese and taiwanese trawlers that fished intensively off northern australia from <year> to <year>
these factors coupled with the plain maskray 's limited distribution and low reproductive rate have resulted in its being assessed as near threatened by the international union for conservation of nature iucn
the blue jackets record of <num> – <num> – <num> note <num> was the worst record in the nhl for <year> – <num> and the first time in franchise history they finished in last place
it also marked the third straight year that they missed the playoffs
consequently they had the best chance to receive the first overall selection in the <year> nhl entry draft lottery but lost out to the edmonton oilers and received the second pick instead
the blue jackets began the year with the worst start in franchise history and the worst by any team in an nhl season in <num> years
after an <num> – <num> – <num> start head coach scott arniel was fired and replaced by assistant coach todd richards
the poor season prompted several personnel changes including the trade of all @-@ star forward jeff carter who was acquired with much fanfare during the off @-@ season
with the prospect of another rebuild looming the blue jackets captain and best player rick nash requested to be traded though he would remain with the team for the entire season
the team was involved in a controversial loss to the los angeles kings when the staples center clock appeared to freeze at <num>
<num> seconds allowing the kings time to score the tying goal before winning in overtime
during the season columbus managed only two winning streaks of three or more games
one of which came towards the end of the year helping the blue jackets finish with <num> points the third worst point total in franchise history
the first deal general manager scott howson made was the acquisition of all @-@ star forward jeff carter on june <num> <year>
the deal sent jakub voracek columbus first @-@ round draft choice the eighth overall and their third @-@ round pick in the <year> draft to the philadelphia flyers in exchange for carter
the trade received a positive response in columbus from fans and management who felt they finally had a number one center to play alongside of their best player rick nash
next they traded for the negotiating rights of soon to be free agent james wisniewski
wisniewski scored a career high <num> points during the <year> – <num> season splitting time between the new york islanders and montreal canadiens
the point total was fifth @-@ highest in the league for defenseman scoring tying tobias enstrom
the blue jackets came to terms with wisniewski just an hour prior to the start of free agency signing him to a six @-@ year <num> million deal
columbus also traded former first round draft pick nikita filatov to the ottawa senators for a third @-@ round pick in the <year> draft
filatov had failed to live up to expectations in columbus playing in only <num> games over three seasons scoring six goals
prior to the start of the season the blue jackets were questioned for not signing a veteran back @-@ up to starting goaltender steve mason as the former calder memorial trophy winner had struggled in consecutive seasons
the blue jackets signed mark dekanich as the back @-@ up who had only <num> minutes of nhl experience prior to the start of the season
columbus did sign a veteran curtis sanford to be their third string goaltender and to start for their american hockey league ahl affiliate the springfield falcons
sanford had not played in the nhl since <year>
during training camp dekanich suffered a high ankle sprain that was expected to keep him out of the line @-@ up for a month
additionally sanford suffered a groin injury leaving allen york as the back @-@ up
york had only played four professional games all in the ahl entering the season
while carter was injured the blue jackets continued to lose games
in the eighth game of the year they had a chance to end the losing streak against the ottawa senators
columbus held a <num> – <num> lead with under a minute to play
jason spezza tied the game on a late power play and with just <num>
<num> seconds remaining milan michalek notched the winning goal for the senators
the loss helped set a franchise record for futility with a <num> – <num> – <num> record to start a season
note <num> the losing streak came to an end three days later with a win over the detroit red wings
during the game several milestones were reached
james wisniewski made his columbus debut ryan johansen and john moore scored their first career nhl goals and grant clitsome had a career @-@ high three assists
columbus was unable to create any momentum from the win however and continued to struggle culminating in a <num> – <num> – <num> record which was the worst start to an nhl season for any team in <num> years
with the team struggling management attempted to shake things up by making some roster moves
the first move was the acquisition of center mark letestu from the pittsburgh penguins
next they traded defenseman kris russell to the st
louis blues for nikita nikitin
as the clubs slow start continued there were rumors that head coach scott arniel would be fired and replaced with ken hitchcock
hitchcock had previously coached the blue jackets to their only playoff appearance in club history and was still under contract with the franchise through to the end of the season
before any of these rumors came to fruition the st
louis blues asked columbus for permission to hire hitchcock which the blue jackets allowed
hitchcock began his blues coaching career with a <num> – <num> – <num> record in his first nine games while columbus amassed a <num> – <num> – <num> record to start the season
during the same time frame as the hitchcock rumors goaltender curtis sanford returned from his groin injury on november <num>
he made his first start of the season against the boston bruins losing <num> – <num> in a shootout
sanford continued his strong play posting a <num> – <num> – <num> record <num>
<num> goals against average and
<num> save percentage over his next six games
sanford started <num> consecutive games before steve mason made his next start
the number of starts might not have been as numerous but prior to the november <num> game mason was hit in the head by a shot from rick nash during pre @-@ game warm @-@ ups and suffered a concussion
mason returned from his concussion after two games making a start against the vancouver canucks
mason allowed only one goal in the game despite suffering from cramping in the third period temporarily being replaced by sanford for just over three minutes
columbus won the game <num> – <num> in a shootout breaking a nine @-@ game losing streak to the canucks
after the game arniel stated that sanford was still seen as the team 's number one goaltender
however mason started four of the next six games with the blue jackets going <num> – <num> – <num> during that stretch
unlike before the rumors were about player moves rather than coaching changes
the majority of rumors were that the blue jackets would trade rick nash
while howson stated that he had never brought up trading nash in discussions other teams had inquired about his availability
nash stated that if columbus felt it would make the franchise better than he would be willing to waive his no @-@ trade clause
howson publicly stated that he had no intention of trading nash
more rumors came to light when reports attributed to réseau des sports stated that carter was unhappy in columbus and demanded a trade
howson carter and his agent all denied that a trade request was ever made and they were unsure where the reports were coming from
with the trade deadline approaching speculation picked up on the blue jackets trading carter
reports were that columbus was trying to trade carter and that he was <num> percent available
at the halfway point of the season with the blue jackets barely into double digit wins with an <num> – <num> – <num> record worst in the league and sitting <num> points out of playoff position columbus fired arniel
he was replaced by assistant coach todd richards on an interim basis
richards had previously coached the minnesota wild
he recorded his first coaching victory for the blue jackets in his second game a <num> – <num> win over the phoenix coyotes
the change in coaching did not change the fortunes of the team as they reached the all @-@ star break with a <num> – <num> – <num> record
at the break blue jackets owner john p
mcconnell sent out a letter to fans stating his understanding of their frustration
he added that action would be taken around the trade deadline the entry draft and free agency to take the team in a new direction
when speaking of the season mcconnell stated disappointing is not a strong enough word and that he was committed to giving fans a team of which they can be proud of
he also thanked them for their dedication and passion while reiterating that the team goal was to win consistently and compete for the stanley cup
days later a <num> @-@ person protest occurred outside of nationwide arena
fans were upset with the blue jackets management and were calling for changes at the top
the same day the fans protested it was announced that the franchise would host the <year> all @-@ star game
columbus was without a representative for the <year> all @-@ star game but ryan johansen represented the club as a rookie participant in the super skills competition
in the competition johansen participated in the allstate insurance nhl breakaway challenge a shootout themed event judged by the fans
he received just <num> of the vote and finished last
following the break the blue jackets were on the road playing the los angeles kings and with the score tied late in the game kings defenseman drew doughty scored with just <num>
<num> seconds remaining to win the game
upon review of the goal it was determined that the clock at staples center froze at <num>
<num> seconds for over a full second which would have resulted in time expiring prior to the goal being scored
kings general manager dean lombardi stated that the clock was correct and no extra time had been added due to the way the clock self @-@ corrects at various times
howson stated on the team 's blog that it is an amazing coincidence that with the kings on a power play at staples center and with a mad scramble around our net in the dying seconds of the third period of a <num> – <num> hockey game that the clock stopped for at least one full second adding that either there was a deliberate stopping of the clock or the clock malfunctioned
nhl senior vice president of hockey operations colin campbell stated that the blue jackets were wronged but that the outcome of the game could not be changed and that the delay was not noticed by the off @-@ ice officials or the situation room in toronto
to determine the true cause of the clock pause the nhl launched an investigation talking with the clock 's manufacturer and interviewing staples center staff
two weeks prior to the nhl trade deadline columbus announced that unlike earlier in the season they would listen to trade proposals involving rick nash though they were not actively shopping him
howson stated that the team was open to all options for improving the team including trading nash
speculation was that in return for nash the blue jackets would ask for a combination of young proven players high @-@ end prospects and draft picks
leading up to the trade deadline the blue jackets dealt antoine vermette to the phoenix coyotes for two draft picks and goaltender curtis mcelhinney
despite being injured at the time the acquisition of mcelhinney was believed to give columbus the flexibility to trade curtis sanford
the following day on february <num> columbus traded jeff carter to the kings
in the deal columbus acquired defenseman jack johnson and a first @-@ round draft pick the team was given the choice of taking the pick in either <year> or <year>
at the deadline columbus was unable to come to terms on a deal involving nash but they did make one more move they sent center samuel pahlsson to the vancouver canucks in exchange for two fourth @-@ round draft picks and minor league defenseman taylor ellington
following the trade deadline howson announced that the team had attempted to trade nash at the player 's request
nash stated that he had requested the trade after being informed that the franchise was going into another rebuilding phase
he further noted that he felt that he could be a huge part of that towards bringing assets in and in his view it was the best thing for the team the organization and personally for his career
after the personnel changes the blue jackets closed out the month with a three @-@ game losing streak
they proceeded to win their next game against the phoenix coyotes <num> – <num> which marked the first time that the blue jackets posted back @-@ to @-@ back regulation victories during the season
columbus again defeated the coyotes three days later to earn their first three @-@ game win streak of the season
they extended the streak to four with a win over the los angeles kings before it came to an end with a <num> – <num> loss to the st
louis blues
it was the only four @-@ game win streak of the season for the blue jackets
they immediately matched their four @-@ game win streak with a four @-@ game losing streak and with ten games remaining the blue jackets were the first team eliminated from playoff contention
shortly after being eliminated they were defeated by the edmonton oilers <num> – <num> the loss clinched last place in the nhl for columbus
it was the first time in franchise history the blue jackets finished in <num> place
three days later on march <num> goaltender steve mason was injured in the morning skate when a shot from colton gillies hit him in the mask
with sanford again injured york made an emergency start
playing against the detroit red wings york made <num> saves including <num> in the third period helping columbus to a <num> – <num> victory and giving york his first career nhl win
york remained the starter and led the blue jackets to a second three @-@ game winning streak
in his fourth start columbus was shutout by the coyotes despite a franchise @-@ record <num> shots on goal losing <num> – <num>
the <num> saves by phoenix goaltender mike smith set an nhl record for a regulation shutout
mason returned to the starter 's role for the final two games winning both
the two victories gave columbus <num> points for the year their third @-@ lowest total in franchise history
the blue jackets struggled in shorthanded situations allowing the most power @-@ play goals in the league with <num> and having the lowest penalty @-@ kill percentage at <num>
with the nhl 's weighted draft lottery the blue jackets had a <num>
<num> chance of drafting first overall
however the lottery was won by the edmonton oilers who proceeded to leapfrog columbus and secure the number one draft pick for a third consecutive year
it was the fifth time that the blue jackets were dropped one draft position in the franchise 's <num> lottery participations
a month later on may <num> the blue jackets announced that richards would remain as head coach and signed him to a two @-@ year contract
during the press conference howson noted our team continuously improved under todd and he has earned the opportunity to build upon the work he started
columbus posted an <num> – <num> – <num> record under richards including winning seven of their final <num> games
division rivals chicago blackhawks detroit red wings nashville predators and st

penalty minutes are the total number of minutes assigned to a player for infractions assessed during the season
plus @-@ minus is a statistic that tracks when a player was on the ice while goals were scored both for and against their team though some in game situations will not effect the statistic
below is a listing of all player statistics for the blue jackets during the season

to remedy the situation the team signed former university of michigan goaltender shawn hunwick to a one @-@ day amateur tryout contract
after being eliminated from the ncaa tournament just days prior hunwick skipped an astronomy class and drove his worn down <year> ford ranger to columbus to make the game
he served as the back @-@ up to allen york during the game and the following day he signed a contract for the remainder of the year
with mason returning from injury hunwick was third on the team 's depth chart when an injury to york allowed hunwick to remain as the back @-@ up for the final two games of the year
in the final game of the season the blue jackets were leading the islanders <num> – <num> with <num> <num> remaining when at the behest of his teammates head coach todd richards put hunwick in to finish the game
he did not face a shot
hunwick was the franchise record ninth player to make his nhl debut during the season
conversely vaclav prospal played in his <num> nhl game during the year
hejda who played four of his first five nhl seasons with the blue jackets was offered a contract by columbus but felt that the organization undervalued him and left via free agency
columbus had offered him a three @-@ year <num>
<num> million contract
he instead signed a four @-@ year <num> million deal with the colorado avalanche
stralman and lepisto were not given qualifying offers which made them unrestricted free agents and both signed with other teams
commodore had originally signed a big contract with the blue jackets in <year> but fell out of favor
he was waived sent to the minors and eventually had his contract bought out
in order to replace the departed players columbus not only acquired james wisniewski but also signed ten @-@ year nhl veteran radek martinek
martinek played only seven games with the blue jackets before suffering a concussion and missing the remainder of the season
brett lebda was brought in to replace him
the tower was built between <year> and <year> to a design by the bolognese architect ottaviano mascherino who was credited with building the apostolic palace mainly to promote the study of astronomy for the gregorian calendar reform which was commissioned by pope gregory xiii and promulgated in <year>
it was then also known as the tower of winds
the tower is now called the specola astronomica vaticana the vatican observatory
four stages of progressive development have occurred since it was first established
the tower was an edifice of great value for astronomical observations made using a sundial as they provided essential confirmation of the need to reform the julian calendar
the directive was to build a tower at a suitable location in the vatican and equip it with the greatest and best instruments of the time
the design was effected after a series of meetings of the experts who had been appointed to reform the julian calendar in use since <num> bc to verify their proposed reforms
fr
christoph clavius a jesuit mathematician from the roman college was the expert on the committee who suggested the new system for the observations
the <num> metres <num> ft tower was then built above the museum and library flanked by the belvedere and della pigna courtyards
the instrumentation for the observation of the sun rays falling over it consisted of a meridian line designed by ignazio danti of perugia
it was in the form of a circular marble plate in the centre embellished with scientific designs
the tower still remains today but has undergone improvements over the centuries
filippo luigi gilii a clergyman of st
peter 's basilica
earlier in <year> pius vi gave approval to placing a latin inscription specula vaticana at the entrance to the upper part of the tower which was implemented by cardinal zelada with plans to enhance the instrumentation system in the tower 's observatory
the original observatory was then set up above the second level of the tower with the agreement of pope pius vi
its instrumentation apart from many normal devices such as meteorological and magnetic equipment with a seismograph and a small transit and pendulum clock was noted for the dolland telescope
the instrumentation facilitated recording of occurrences of eclipse appearance of comets satellites of jupiter and mercury ’ s transit
as an addition under the patronage of pope pius x four rotary observatory domes were also added at strategic locations on the <num> @,@ <num> feet <num> m long fortification walls more than a thousand years old
mgr
gilii highly respected as a polyglot with a knowledge of physics biology archeology and the hebrew language was in charge of the observatory from <year> to <year>
he carried out continuous meteorological observations twice a day at <num> am and <num> pm conforming to the programme of the mannheim meteorological society
while the observation records for seven years were published the balance data in a manuscript form was preserved in the vatican library
subsequent to gilii 's death in <year> the observatory on the tower was discontinued and the instruments were moved to the observatory at the roman college
established in <year> it was considered more suitable for making observations than the vatican
high quality instruments were procured partly with generous donations from hicks of london and the automatic recording instruments were procured from richard in paris
a four @-@ inch equatorial a three @-@ inch transit instrument and four pendulum clocks with two chronometers were also procured from the observatory at modena
in <year> the gift of a <num> inch long telescope to pope leo xiii became a part of the observatory
father denza joined the observatory in <year> after it was upgraded with more modern instruments
the same year a second tower was built some <num> metres <num> @,@ <num> ft away from the main gregorian tower overlooking the vatican gardens behind st
peter 's basilica on the south @-@ west border
it was built to a diameter of <num> metres <num> ft with a lower wall thickness of <num>
<num> metres <num> ft which could bear the load of a <num> inch photographic refractor newly procured from paris
augustinian father rodriguez was the expert meteorologist who held the post of director from <year> to <year>
in <year> pope leo xiii promulgating the motu proprio ut mysticam designated the second tower as the seat of the newly established vatican observatory a decision which required altering the roof to provide a flat terrace for astronomical observations
his plans were to make the gregorian tower into a historical tower and to record and carry out observations at the second tower by linking the two towers along the fortified wall with a <num> metres <num> ft iron bridge spanning the gap
at the west end of this bridge a four @-@ inch equatorial was installed on semicircular bastion
the east end of the bridge above the barracks of the gendarmes had a heliograph with a camera attached used to photograph the sun photoheliograph
a new <num> @-@ inch visual telescope called torre pio x was erected in the second tower
as a result of these modifications the original library was moved to the pontifical academy lincei and the old meteorological and seismic instruments were shifted to the valle di pompei observatory
the new astronomical library was housed in two rooms of the building
the two new repsold machines were used for recording on the astrographic plates
the recorded observations were published along with explanatory notes together with the last two series of the atlas of stars
charts were printed on silver bromide paper
on the first floor was the famous sundial room or meridian room which was initially an open loggia
pope urban viii had it enclosed and it was subsequently decorated with long sequences of frescoes painted between <year> and <year> by simon lagi and the two flemish artists paul and matthijs bril
today the tower has paintings by cristoforo roncalli and matteino da siena
the sundial room also called the meridian hall was once the residence of queen christina of sweden then newly converted to catholicism
the room was further modified by two additions which gave it its current name a sundial and a delicate but sophisticated anemoscope which was fixed to the ceiling of the meridian hall
these were created by ignazio danti the papal cosmographer in association with the gregorian calendar reform
the sundial consisted of a straight line in white marble running across the floor in a north @-@ south direction intended to measure the height of the sun at noon according to the seasons of the year
the observations made with the sundial provided essential confirmation of the need to reform the julian calendar
the anemoscope in contrast was a complex mechanism attached to the ceiling which was used to measure the strength and direction of the wind but soon stopped functioning
the instrument may have led to the other name of the tower tower of the winds however an ancient observatory at athens was also called the tower of the winds and might have been the source for inspiration
the interior walls and ceiling of the hall were richly decorated in some cases with gaudy frescoes of the hills and roman countryside the pantheons religious themes the buildings surrounding the area and naval shipwrecks with jesus calming the storm and so forth
columbia released it as the fifth and final single from the album in the united kingdom
it was one of four songs carey wrote with ric wake during their first recording session together but there 's got to be a way was the only composition to make the final track listing
it is a socio @-@ political conscious r b @-@ pop song which addresses the existence of poverty racism and war in the world which gradually becomes more aspirational and positive as it progresses
the track garnered a mixed reception upon the album 's release in <year>
while carey 's vocals were praised it was seen as too political
an accompanying music video highlights social injustices
the song reached number <num> on the uk singles chart
it was written during carey and wake 's first recording session together
they composed four songs but only there 's got to be a way was chosen for the final track listing
co @-@ produced by wake and narada michael walden it appears as the second of ten songs on the track listing
the track was recorded and engineered by bob cadway at cove city sound studios and the power station both located in new york city
he was assisted by dana jon chappelle
it was mixed by david frazer at tarpan studios in san rafael
the keyboards bass and rhythm engineering was carried out by louis biancaniello while joe franco performed the percussion vernon ice black played the guitar and rich tancredo also performing on the keyboards
walter afanasieff played the synth horns
carey provided her own background vocals along with billy t
scott jamiliah muhammed and the billy t
scott ensemble
the song was released as the fifth and final single from the album in the united kingdom
it is available to purchase as a cd single while the remixes are available on vinyl
the theme of social activism can be heard in the lyrics there ’ s got to be a way to connect this world today
the song begins with carey publicly denouncing the existence of poverty and racism in the world and she uses the bridge to shift the lyrics towards an uplifting and aspirational tone
carey suggests we should be more tolerant of each other and not resort so readily to war in the lyrics couldn 't we accept each other can 't we make ourselves aware
ralph novak david hiltbrand and david grogan of people wrote that it is a testimony to her talent that she does so much with so little
they continued to write that carey 's tone and clarity makes there 's got to be a way a mesmerizing track
to mark twenty @-@ five years since the release of mariah carey in june <year> billboard writer trevor anderson wrote a track @-@ by @-@ track review of the album in june <year>
he noted that there 's got to be a way follows the same melodic tone as the album 's opener vision of love but highlighted their stark lyrical differences as the former is about social activism and the latter is about love
although he praised carey 's vocals writing that she deploys one of her best whistle notes of her career he felt that the aim for broad appeal comes at the expense of memorable lyrics
two men play dominoes on a wooden crate outside a building a gang make fun of an elderly man hanging newspapers outside his store and an obese woman walks down the street
clips of carey leaning against a wall and sitting on some steps looking on at what is happening are shown
as the first chorus begins everyone starts to dance joyfully in the street and help those in need
a gospel choir comes out of one of the buildings as the street becomes more crowded with people of all ages and backgrounds rejoicing and getting along with each other
one of the shops in the background has a neon light outside the entrance which says jesus saves

she was converted from a scottish @-@ built blockade runner named fingal by the confederacy after she made one run to savannah georgia
after several failed attempts to attack union blockaders the ship was captured by two union monitors in <year> when she ran aground
atlanta was floated off repaired and rearmed serving in the union navy for the rest of the war
she spent most of her time deployed on the james river supporting union forces there
the ship was decommissioned in <year> and placed in reserve
several years after the end of the war atlanta was sold to haiti but was lost at sea in december <year> on her delivery voyage
she was described by midshipman dabney scales who served on the atlanta before her battle with the monitors as being a two @-@ masted iron @-@ hulled ship <num> feet <num>
<num> m long with a beam of <num> feet <num>
<num> m
she had a draft of <num> feet <num>
<num> m and a depth of hold of <num> feet <num>
<num> m
he estimated her tonnage at around <num> tons bm
fingal was equipped with two vertical single @-@ cylinder direct @-@ acting steam engines using steam generated by one flue @-@ tubular boiler
the engines drove the ship at a top speed of around <num> knots <num> km h <num> mph
they had a bore of <num> inches <num> mm and a stroke of <num> inches <num> mm
the ship briefly operated between glasgow and other ports in scotland for hutcheson 's west highland service before she was purchased in september <year> by james d
bulloch the primary foreign agent in great britain for the confederacy to deliver the military and naval ordnance and supplies that he had purchased
to disguise his control of fingal and the destination of her cargo bulloch hired an english crew and captain and put out his destination as bermuda and nassau in the bahamas
the cargo was loaded in greenock in early october although bullock and the other passengers would not attempt to board until they rendezvoused with the ship at holyhead wales
on the night <num> <num> october as she was slowly rounding the breakwater at holyhead fingal rammed and sank the austrian brig siccardi slowly swinging at anchor without lights
bulloch and the passengers embarked in the steamer while bulloch dispatched a letter to his financial agents instructing them to settle damages with the brig 's owners because he could not afford to take the time to deal with the affair lest he and fingal be detained
the ship reached bermuda on <num> november and after leaving port on <num> november bulloch informed the crew that the steamer 's real destination was savannah georgia he offered to take anyone who objected to the plan to nassau
however all of the crew agreed to join in the effort to run the union blockade
fingal was able slip safely into the savannah estuary in a heavy fog on the night of <num> november without sighting any blockaders
while fingal was discharging her cargo bulloch went to richmond to confer with stephen mallory secretary of the navy
mallory endorsed bulloch 's plan to load fingal with cotton to sell on the navy department 's account to be used to purchase more ships and equipment in europe
he returned to savannah on <num> november and it took him almost a month to purchase a cargo and acquire enough coal
he made one attempt to break through the blockade on <num> december but it proved impossible to do as the union controlled every channel from savannah aided by their occupation of tybee island at the mouth of the savannah river
bulloch reported to mallory in late january <year> that breaking out was hopeless so mallory ordered him to turn the ship over to another officer and to return to europe some other way
this was largely financed by contributions from the women of savannah
fingal was cut down to her main deck and large wooden sponsons were built out from the sides of her hull to support her casemate
after the conversion atlanta was <num> feet <num>
<num> m long overall and had a beam of <num> feet <num> m
her depth of hold was now <num> feet <num>
<num> m and she now had a draft of <num> feet <num> inches <num>
<num> m
atlanta now displaced <num> @,@ <num> long tons <num> @,@ <num> t and her speed was estimated at <num> – <num> knots <num> – <num> km h <num>
<num> – <num>
<num> mph
the armor of the casemate was angled at <num> ° from the horizontal and made from two layers of railroad rails rolled into plates <num> inches <num> mm thick and <num> inches <num> mm wide
the outer layer ran vertically and the inner layer horizontally
her armor was backed by <num> inches <num> mm of oak vertically oriented and two layers of <num>
<num> inches <num> mm of pine alternating in direction
the bottom of the casemate was some <num> inches <num> mm from the waterline and its top was <num> feet <num> inches <num>
<num> m above the waterline
the pyramidal pilothouse was armored in the same way and had room for two men
the upper portion of atlanta 's hull received two inches of armor
the rectangular casemate was pierced with eight narrow gun ports one each at the bow and stern and three along each side
each gun port was protected by an armored shutter made of two layers of iron riveted together and allowed the guns to elevate only to a maximum of <num> to <num> °
atlanta was armed with single @-@ banded <num> @-@ inch <num> mm brooke rifles on pivot mounts at the bow and stern
the middle gun port on each side was occupied by a single @-@ banded <num>
<num> @-@ inch <num> mm brooke rifle
the <num> @-@ caliber seven @-@ inch guns weighed about <num> @,@ <num> pounds <num> @,@ <num> kg and fired <num> @-@ pound <num> kg armor @-@ piercing bolts and <num> @-@ pound <num> kg explosive shells
the equivalent statistics for the <num>
<num> @-@ caliber <num>
<num> @-@ inch gun were <num> @,@ <num> pounds <num> @,@ <num> kg with <num> @-@ pound bolts and <num> @-@ pound <num> kg shells
atlanta was also armed with a <num> @-@ foot <num>
<num> m solid iron ram that was reinforced by a series of vertical steel bars
in front of the ram was a spar torpedo that carried <num> pounds <num> kg of black powder on a wooden pole connected to an iron lever that could be raised or lowered by means of pulleys
on <num> july <year> under the command of lieutenant charles h
mcblair atlanta conducted her sea trials down the savannah river toward fort pulaski
the ship proved to be difficult to steer and the additional weight of her armor and guns significantly reduced her speed and increased her draft
this latter was a real problem in the shallow waters near savannah
she also leaked significantly and her design virtually eliminated air circulation
one report said that it was almost intolerable on board the atlanta there being no method of ventilation and the heat was intense
scales commented in his diary what a comfortless infernal and god @-@ forsaken ship attempts were made to fix the problems and were at least partially successful in stopping many of the leaks
the ship was commissioned on <num> november and became the flagship of flag officer josiah tattnall commander of the naval defenses of georgia
under pressure from mallory to engage the blockading ships tattnall attempted to engage them before any ironclads arrived on <num> january <year> but army engineers could not clear the obstacles blocking the channel in a timely manner despite early coordination being made by tattnall to do so
it took another month to actually clear the obstacles and two monitors arrived before the end of january
nonetheless tattnall attempted to pass through the obstructions during high tide on <num> february but high winds prevented the water from rising enough to allow the ship to do so
after atlanta successfully passed through them on <num> march tattnall planned to attack the union base at port royal south carolina while the monitors were attacking charleston
deserters revealed tatnall 's plan while he was waiting at the head of wassaw sound and he was forced to retreat when three monitors augmented the defenses at port royal
dissatisfied with tattnall 's perceived lack of aggressiveness mallory replaced tattnall as commander of the savannah squadron later that month with commander richard l
page
page in his turn was relieved in may by commander william a
webb atlanta remained the squadron flagship throughout this time
webb demonstrated his aggressiveness when he attempted to sortie on the first spring tide <num> may after taking command but atlanta 's forward engine broke down after he had passed the obstructions and the ship ran aground
she was not damaged although it took over a day to pull her free
he planned to make another attempt on the next full tide rejecting mallory 's idea that he wait until the nearly complete ironclad savannah was finished before his next sortie
in the meantime rear admiral samuel f
du pont commander of the south atlantic blockading squadron had ordered the monitors weehawken and nahant into wassaw sound
commander john rodgers in weehawken had overall command of the two ships
in the early evening of <num> june webb began his next attempt by passing over the lower obstructions in the wilmington river and spent the rest of the night coaling
he moved forward the next evening to a concealed position within easy reach of the monitors for an attack early the following morning
webb planned to sink one of the monitors with his spar torpedo and then deal with the other one with his guns
the gunboat isondiga and the tugboat resolute were to accompany him to tow one or both of the monitors back to savannah
a lookout aboard weehawken spotted atlanta at <num> <num> on the morning of <num> june
when the latter ship closed to within about <num>
<num> miles <num>
<num> km of the two union ships she fired one round from her bow gun that passed over weehawken and landed near nahant
shortly afterward atlanta ran aground on a sandbar she was briefly able to free herself but the pressure of the tide pushed her back onto the sandbar
this time webb was unable to get off and the monitors closed the range
when weehawken the leading ship closed to within <num> – <num> yards <num> – <num> m she opened fire with both of her guns
the <num> @-@ inch <num> mm shell missed but the <num> @-@ inch <num> mm shell struck the ironclad above the port middle gun port penetrated her armor and broke the wooden backing behind it spraying splinters and fragments that disabled the entire gun crew and half the crew of the bow gun even though it failed to cleanly penetrate through the backing
the next shot from the <num> @-@ inch dahlgren gun struck the upper hull and started a small leak even though it failed to penetrate the two @-@ inch armor there
the next shell from the <num> @-@ inch dahlgren glanced off the middle starboard gun shutter as it was being opened wounding half the gun 's crew with fragments
the final shell was also from the <num> @-@ inch dahlgren and it struck the top of the pilothouse breaking the armor there and wounding both pilots in it
by this time atlanta had been able to fire only seven shots none of which hit either union ship and was hard aground with high tide not due for another hour and a half
weehawken and nahant were able to freely maneuver into positions from which the atlanta 's narrow gun ports would not allow her to reply and the damage already inflicted by the former ship made further resistance futile
webb surrendered his ship within <num> minutes of opening fire before nahant even had a chance to fire
of the ironclad 's <num> officers and <num> enlisted men one man was killed and another sixteen were wounded badly enough to require hospitalization
not badly damaged she was repaired and bought by the union navy
the prize money of <num> @,@ <num> was shared between the crews of weehawken nahant and the gunboat cimarron the only ships within signaling distance
the ship retained her name and was commissioned again on <num> february <year> rearmed with a pair of <num> @-@ inch <num> mm <num> @-@ pound parrott rifles in the bow and stern and <num>
<num> @-@ inch <num> @-@ pound parrott rifles amidships
the <num> @-@ pound parrott rifle weighed <num> @,@ <num> pounds <num> @,@ <num> kg and was <num> calibers long
the <num> @-@ pounder weighed <num> @,@ <num> pounds <num> @,@ <num> kg and was <num> calibers long
it fired a <num> @-@ pound <num> kg shell a distance of <num> @,@ <num> yards <num> @,@ <num> m at an elevation of <num> °
all four of her brooke rifles are currently located in willard park in the washington navy yard
atlanta was assigned to the north atlantic blockading squadron and spent most of her time stationed up the james river where she could support operations against richmond and defend against a sortie by the ironclads of the james river squadron
on <num> may <year> she and the gunboat dawn fired on and dispersed confederate cavalry that was attacking fort powhatan and she was deployed further upriver in february <year> after the battle of trent 's reach to better blockade the confederate ironclads at richmond
after the end of the war in april atlanta was decommissioned in philadelphia on <num> june <year> and placed in reserve at league island
she was sold to sam ward on <num> may <year> for the price of <num> @,@ <num> and subsequently delivered to representatives of haiti on <num> december by sydney oaksmith a lawyer who had received an advance of <num> @,@ <num> on her purchase price of <num> @,@ <num>
the ship was briefly seized by the customs service possibly for violations of neutrality laws as she had just loaded four large guns and a number of recruits for the forces of sylvain salnave president of haiti who was embroiled in a civil war
atlanta was released and sailed for port @-@ au @-@ prince three days later
she broke down in delaware bay and had to put in at chester pennsylvania for repairs
the ship now renamed either triumph or triumfo departed on <num> december <year> and vanished en route apparently sinking with the loss of all hands either off cape hatteras or the delaware capes

he joined his brother in the car dealership business after leaving the game and briefly operated his own dealership until forced to close during the automotive industry crisis of <year> – <num>
he is one of six children of barry and loretta cullen
his father and uncles brian and ray all played in the nhl and while cullen and his three brothers all played as well their father never pressured them preferring that they enjoy the game
he idolized his elder brother terry who was considered a top nhl prospect until terry 's career was ended when he suffered a broken neck after being hit from behind into the boards during a college game
while his brother was highly sought by american universities john received only two scholarship offers choosing to play for boston university bu in <year>
at the same time his mother loretta was diagnosed with skin cancer
following her death early in his freshman year cullen contemplated returning to his ontario home but was convinced by his father to continue with both school and hockey
he used the game to cope with the loss and dedicated every game he played to his mother 's memory
cullen felt that the inspiration he drew from his mother 's battle allowed him to become a better player
the national hockey league passed him over however as he went unclaimed in the <year> nhl entry draft
he was named to the hockey east all @-@ star teams in <year> <year> and <year> and a national collegiate athletic association east second team all @-@ american in <year>
he graduated as bu 's all @-@ time scoring leader with <num> points and was named to bu 's hockey east <num> anniversary team in <year>
passed over in the entry draft cullen was finally selected by the buffalo sabres in the <year> nhl supplemental draft

he led the league with <num> points scoring <num> goals and won the james gatschene memorial trophy as league most valuable player while sharing the gary f
longman memorial trophy with ed belfour as rookie of the year
cullen 's outstanding season in flint caught the attention of the sabres and the pittsburgh penguins
he signed a contract with the penguins for the league minimum passing up a superior contract offer from buffalo as he remained upset at how they released him the year before
he was given a greater role with the penguins the following year after mario lemieux missed <num> games due to a back injury and responded by scoring <num> goals and <num> points to finish third in team scoring
additionally he played for team canada at the <year> world championship scoring four points in ten games
cullen had his best season in <year> – <num>
as one of the team 's top offensive centres he scored <num> points in the penguins first <num> games and played in his first nhl all @-@ star game
however when lemieux returned after missing an additional <num> @-@ games due to injury cullen 's playing time and production declined
the penguins needs led them to complete a blockbuster trade on march <num> <year>
cullen was sent to the hartford whalers along with zarley zalapski and jeff parker in exchange for hartford 's all @-@ time leading scorer ron francis along with ulf samuelsson and grant jennings
the penguins almost turned down the deal as they were concerned about giving up cullen 's playmaking and leadership abilities while his former teammates credited cullen as being the primary reason they were in a playoff position at the time the trade happened
after the penguins won their first stanley cup that season phil bourque later said it broke his heart that cullen was not able to share in that championship
in hartford cullen worked to overcome the team 's fans disappointment at losing francis
the hartford fans initially booed him to show their dissatisfaction with the trade
he scored <num> points in <num> regular season games to finish the season with <num> points combined between the penguins and whalers and was the team 's best player in their first round loss to the boston bruins in the <year> stanley cup playoffs
he initially accepted an invitation to join the canadian team at the <year> canada cup but subsequently chose not to participate as his contract had expired leading to greater insurance concerns
still without a contract when the <year> – <num> season began cullen missed the first four games before signing a four @-@ year deal with hartford worth a total of <num> million
he returned to score <num> points in <num> games in his first full season with the whalers and represented the team at the <year> all @-@ star game
midway through the <year> – <num> nhl season the whalers sent cullen to the toronto maple leafs for toronto 's second round selection at the <year> nhl entry draft
cullen was excited to play for his father 's old team but injuries reduced his ability to perform
his most significant injury was a herniated disc in his neck that doctors initially feared would end his career
a bulky neck brace allowed cullen to return and play out his contract in toronto
when the leafs chose not to re @-@ sign him following the <year> – <num> season he returned to the penguins for one season before tony esposito convinced him to sign with the tampa bay lightning in <year>
cullen enjoyed immediate success with linemates shawn burr and alexander selivanov as the trio combined to score <num> points and helped lead the lightning to the first playoff appearance in franchise history
they were eliminated by the philadelphia flyers in five games while cullen led the team in playoff scoring with three goals and three assists
the lightning looked to improve in <year> – <num> cullen was leading the team in scoring but was suffering flu @-@ like symptoms that he could not shake
as tampa was fighting for a playoff spot he played through his condition for weeks
the team took an x @-@ ray and found a large black shadow in his chest
he underwent a cat scan which revealed cullen had a baseball @-@ sized tumor he was diagnosed as having non @-@ hodgkin lymphoma
the diagnosis ended his season and he immediately began chemotherapy treatments that quickly reduced his cancer
the tumor was gone by september <year> but a precautionary test prior to training camp revealed that cullen still had cancer cells in his body
he missed the entire <year> – <num> nhl season as he continued to battle the disease while his teammates wore a uniform patch with his <num> in support throughout the year
on one day during his treatments as his wife was wheeling him down a hospital corridor cullen went into cardiac arrest requiring doctors to use a defibrillator to revive him
he underwent a bone marrow transplant that briefly reduced his immune system to the point that he could have very little human contact
another examination in april <year> revealed that the cancer was finally gone and cullen immediately began training for a comeback
the lightning signed cullen to a one @-@ year <num> @,@ <num> contract for the <year> – <num> season
he played his first game in nearly <num> months on september <num> <year> in an exhibition game between the lightning and sabres at innsbruck austria
cullen scored the game @-@ winning goal in a <num> – <num> victory after which he said he sat on the bench in disbelief over how he was given a second chance
he was named to the roster and was greeted with a loud standing ovation by the fans in tampa bay when he was introduced prior to their season opening game
cullen appeared in four of the lightning 's first eight games but it was evident that he had lost much of his speed and strength
the lightning assigned him to the ihl 's cleveland lumberjacks but also gave him the option of retiring and taking up a position as an assistant coach
he chose to accept the demotion giving himself one month to determine if he could continue playing
he appeared in six games for cleveland and in one game against the chicago wolves tied an ihl record when he scored seven points in a <num> – <num> victory
however a bout of bronchitis led cullen to fear that his cancer had returned
tests came back negative but after spending time with his family he realized that neither he nor his family were interested in returning to cleveland
cullen announced his retirement on november <num> <year> and accepted the lightning offer to become an assistant coach
in recognition of his comeback attempt the nhl named him the <year> winner of the bill masterton memorial trophy for dedication and perseverance while the ihl renamed its comeback player of the year award the john cullen award
former lightning head coach terry crisp has stated publicly that cullen was a player that stood out as something special saying “ john cullen
beat cancer and came back to play and helped us win
unwilling to spend so much time away from his family he left the lightning in <year> and settled in the atlanta area joining his brother 's car dealership in jonesboro georgia
he had always expected to become a car dealer after his hockey career as his father uncles and brother all worked in the industry
after apprenticing under his brother for five years he bought a dodge dealership in newnan georgia in <year>
however he owned the dealership for less than two years before chrysler closed him down as part of its recovery plan in response to the automotive industry crisis of <year> – <year>
he has since returned to his brother 's dealership serving as its general manager
cullen 's battle with cancer inspired timm harmon of the moffitt cancer centre to partner with the lightning to raise awareness and money for cancer research
the nhl itself joined the cause in the winter of <year> creating the hockey fights cancer program to raise money for research
cullen has spent time promoting the initiative
prior to marrying his wife valerie john dated carolyn bessette the future wife of john f

the beliefs and rituals surrounding these gods formed the core of ancient egyptian religion which emerged sometime in prehistory
deities represented natural forces and phenomena and the egyptians supported and appeased them through offerings and rituals so that these forces would continue to function according to maat or divine order
after the founding of the egyptian state around <num> bc the authority to perform these tasks was controlled by the pharaoh who claimed to be the gods representative and managed the temples where the rituals were carried out
the gods complex characteristics were expressed in myths and in intricate relationships between deities family ties loose groups and hierarchies and combinations of separate gods into one
deities diverse appearances in art — as animals humans objects and combinations of different forms — also alluded through symbolism to their essential features
in different eras various gods were said to hold the highest position in divine society including the solar deity ra the mysterious god amun and the mother goddess isis
the highest deity was usually credited with the creation of the world and often connected with the life @-@ giving power of the sun
some scholars have argued based in part on egyptian writings that the egyptians came to recognize a single divine power that lay behind all things and was present in all the other deities
yet they never abandoned their original polytheistic view of the world except possibly during the era of atenism in the <num> century bc when official religion focused exclusively on the impersonal sun god aten
gods were assumed to be present throughout the world capable of influencing natural events and the course of human lives
people interacted with them in temples and unofficial shrines for personal reasons as well as for larger goals of state rites
egyptians prayed for divine help used rituals to compel deities to act and called upon them for advice
humans relations with their gods were a fundamental part of egyptian society
egyptian texts list the names of many deities whose nature is unknown and make vague indirect references to other gods who are not even named
the egyptologist james p
allen estimates that more than <num> @,@ <num> deities are named in egyptian texts whereas his colleague christian leitz says there are thousands upon thousands of gods
the egyptian language 's terms for these beings were nṯr god and its feminine form nṯrt goddess
scholars have tried to discern the original nature of the gods by proposing etymologies for these words but none of these suggestions has gained acceptance and the terms origin remains obscure
the hieroglyphs that were used as ideograms and determinatives in writing these words show some of the traits that the egyptians connected with divinity
the most common of these signs is a flag flying from a pole
similar objects were placed at the entrances of temples representing the presence of a deity throughout ancient egyptian history
other such hieroglyphs include a falcon reminiscent of several early gods who were depicted as falcons and a seated male or female deity
the feminine form could also be written with an egg as determinative connecting goddesses with creation and birth or with a cobra reflecting the use of the cobra to depict many female deities
the egyptians distinguished nṯrw gods from rmṯ people but the meanings of the egyptian and the english terms do not match perfectly
the term nṯr may have applied to any being that was in some way outside the sphere of everyday life
deceased humans were called nṯr because they were considered to be like the gods whereas the term was rarely applied to many of egypt 's lesser supernatural beings which modern scholars often call demons
egyptian religious art also depicts places objects and concepts in human form
these personified ideas range from deities that were important in myth and ritual to obscure beings only mentioned once or twice that may be little more than metaphors
confronting these blurred distinctions between gods and other beings scholars have proposed various definitions of a deity
one widely accepted definition suggested by jan assmann says that a deity has a cult is involved in some aspect of the universe and is described in mythology or other forms of written tradition
according to a different definition by dimitri meeks nṯr applied to any being that was the focus of ritual
from this perspective gods included the king who was called a god after his coronation rites and deceased souls who entered the divine realm through funeral ceremonies
likewise the preeminence of the great gods was maintained by the ritual devotion that was performed for them across egypt
<num> – <num> bc
deities must have emerged sometime in the preceding predynastic period before <num> bc and grown out of prehistoric religious beliefs
predynastic artwork depicts a variety of animal and human figures
some of these images such as stars and cattle are reminiscent of important features of egyptian religion in later times but in most cases there is not enough evidence to say whether the images are connected with deities
as egyptian society grew more sophisticated clearer signs of religious activity appeared
the earliest known temples appeared in the last centuries of the predynastic era along with images that resemble the iconographies of known deities the falcon that represents horus and several other gods the crossed arrows that stand for neith and the enigmatic set animal that represents set
many egyptologists and anthropologists have suggested theories about how the gods developed in these early times
gustave jéquier for instance thought the egyptians first revered primitive fetishes then deities in animal form and finally deities in human form whereas henri frankfort argued that the gods must have been envisioned in human form from the beginning
some of these theories are now regarded as too simplistic and more current ones such as siegfried morenz hypothesis that deities emerged as humans began to distinguish themselves from and personify their environment are difficult to prove
predynastic egypt originally consisted of small independent villages
because many deities in later times were strongly tied to particular towns and regions many scholars have suggested that the pantheon formed as disparate communities coalesced into larger states spreading and intermingling the worship of the old local deities
but others have argued that the most important predynastic gods were like other elements of egyptian culture present all across the country despite the political divisions within it
the final step in the formation of egyptian religion was the unification of egypt in which rulers from upper egypt made themselves pharaohs of the entire country
these sacred kings and their subordinates assumed the exclusive right to interact with the gods and kingship became the unifying focus of the religion
new gods continued to emerge after this transformation
some important deities like isis and amun are not known to have appeared until the old kingdom c
<num> – <num> bc
places and concepts could suddenly inspire the creation of a deity to represent them and deities were sometimes created to serve as opposite @-@ sex counterparts to established gods or goddesses
kings were said to be divine although only a few continued to be worshipped long after their deaths
some non @-@ royal humans were said to have the favor of the gods and were venerated accordingly
this veneration was usually short @-@ lived but the court architects imhotep and amenhotep son of hapu were regarded as gods centuries after their lifetimes as were some other officials
through contact with neighboring civilizations the egyptians also adopted foreign deities
dedun who is first mentioned in the old kingdom may have come from nubia and baal anat and astarte among others were adopted from canaanite religion during the new kingdom c
<year> – <num> bc
in greek and roman times from <num> bc to the early centuries ad deities from across the mediterranean world were revered in egypt but the native gods remained and they often absorbed the cults of these newcomers into their own worship
these people were the elite of egyptian society and were very distinct from the general populace most of whom were illiterate
little is known about how well this broader population knew or understood the sophisticated ideas that the elite developed
commoners perceptions of the divine may have differed from those of the priests
the populace may for example have mistaken the religion 's symbolic statements about the gods and their actions for literal truth
but overall what little is known about popular religious belief is consistent with the elite tradition
the two traditions form a largely cohesive vision of the gods and their nature
the gods were generally said to be immanent in these phenomena — to be present within nature
the types of phenomena they represented include physical places and objects as well as abstract concepts and forces
the god shu was the deification of all the world 's air the goddess meretseger oversaw a limited region of the earth the theban necropolis and the god sia personified the abstract notion of perception
major gods often had many roles and were involved in several types of phenomena
for instance khnum was the god of elephantine island in the midst of the nile the river that was essential to egyptian civilization
he was credited with producing the annual nile flood that fertilized the nation 's farmland
perhaps as an outgrowth of this life @-@ giving function he was said to create all living things fashioning their bodies on a potter 's wheel
gods could share the same role in nature ra atum khepri horus and other deities acted as sun gods
despite their diverse functions most gods had an overarching role in common maintaining maat the universal order that was a central principle of egyptian religion and was itself personified as a goddess
but some deities represented disruption to maat
most prominently apep was the force of chaos constantly threatening to annihilate the order of the universe and set was an ambivalent member of divine society who could both fight disorder and foment it
not all aspects of existence were seen as deities
although many deities were connected with the nile no god personified it in the way that ra personified the sun
short @-@ lived phenomena like rainbows or eclipses were not represented by gods neither were elements like fire and water or many other components of the world
the roles of each deity were fluid and each god could expand its nature to take on new characteristics
as a result gods roles are difficult to categorize or define
but despite their flexibility the gods had limited abilities and spheres of influence
not even the creator god could reach beyond the boundaries of the cosmos that he created and even isis though she was said to be the cleverest of the gods was not omniscient
richard h
wilkinson however argues that some texts from the late new kingdom suggest that as beliefs about the god amun evolved he was thought to approach omniscience and omnipresence and to transcend the limits of the world in a way that other deities did not
the deities with the most limited and specialized domains are often called minor divinities or demons in modern writing although there is no firm definition for these terms
among these lesser deities egyptologist claude traunecker draws a distinction between genies — specialized patron spirits of certain places objects or activities such as the sea or marsh god wadj @-@ wer and the harvest goddess renenutet — and demons who have a more dangerous character
many demons are hostile causing illness and other troubles among humans
their power can also be protective they may guard certain places in the duat the realm of the dead or advise and watch over humans
egyptians believed the landscape was full of these unpredictable divine powers
demons often act as servants and messengers to the greater gods but their position in the hierarchy is not fixed
the protective deities bes and taweret originally had minor demon @-@ like roles but over time they came to be credited with great influence
except for the few deities who disrupted the divine order the gods actions maintained maat and created and sustained all living things
they did this work using a force the egyptians called heka a term usually translated as magic
heka was a fundamental power that the creator god used to form the world and the gods themselves
the gods actions in the present are described and praised in hymns and funerary texts
in contrast mythology mainly concerns the gods actions during a vaguely imagined past in which the gods were present on earth and interacted directly with humans
the events of this past time set the pattern for the events of the present
periodic occurrences were tied to events in the mythic past the succession of each new pharaoh for instance reenacted horus accession to the throne of his father osiris
myths are metaphors for the gods actions which humans cannot fully understand
they contain seemingly contradictory ideas each expressing a particular perspective on divine events
the contradictions in myth are part of the egyptians many @-@ faceted approach to religious belief — what henri frankfort called a multiplicity of approaches to understanding the gods
in myth the gods behave much like humans
they feel emotion they can eat drink fight weep sicken and die
some have unique character traits
set is aggressive and impulsive and thoth patron of writing and knowledge is prone to long @-@ winded speeches
yet overall the gods are more like archetypes than well drawn characters
their behavior is inconsistent and their thoughts and motivations are rarely stated
most myths about them lack highly developed characters and plots because the symbolic meaning of the myths was more important than elaborate storytelling
the first divine act is the creation of the cosmos described in several creation myths
they focus on different gods each of which may act as creator deities
the eight gods of the ogdoad who represent the chaos that precedes creation give birth to the sun god who establishes order in the newly formed world ptah who embodies thought and creativity gives form to all things by envisioning and naming them atum produces all things as emanations of himself and amun according to the myths promoted by his priesthood preceded and created the other creator gods
these and other versions of the events of creation were not seen as contradictory
each gives a different perspective on the complex process by which the organized universe and its many deities emerged from undifferentiated chaos
the period following creation in which a series of gods rule as kings over the divine society is the setting for most myths
the gods struggle against the forces of chaos and among each other before withdrawing from the human world and installing the historical kings of egypt to rule in their place
a recurring theme in these myths is the effort of the gods to maintain maat against the forces of disorder
they fight vicious battles with the forces of chaos at the start of creation
ra and apep battling each other each night continue this struggle into the present
another prominent theme is the gods death and revival
the clearest instance where a god dies is the myth of osiris murder in which that god is resurrected as ruler of the duat
the sun god is also said to grow old during his daily journey across the sky sink into the duat at night and emerge as a young child at dawn
in the process he comes into contact with the rejuvenating water of primordial chaos
funerary texts that depict ra 's journey through the duat also show the corpses of gods who are enlivened along with him
instead of being changelessly immortal the gods periodically died and were reborn by repeating the events of creation thus renewing the whole world
but it was always possible for this cycle to be disrupted and for chaos to return
some poorly understood egyptian texts even suggest that this calamity is destined to happen — that the creator god will one day dissolve the order of the world leaving only himself and osiris amid the primordial chaos
in egyptian tradition the world includes the earth the sky and the duat
surrounding them is the dark formlessness that existed before creation
the gods in general were said to dwell in the sky although gods whose roles were linked with other parts of the universe were said to live in those places instead
most events of mythology set in a time before the gods withdrawal from the human realm take place in an earthly setting
the deities there sometimes interact with those in the sky
the duat in contrast is treated as a remote and inaccessible place and the gods who dwell there have difficulty communicating with those in the world of the living
the space outside the cosmos is also said to be very distant
it too is inhabited by deities some hostile and some beneficial to the other gods and their orderly world
in the time after myth most gods were said to be either in the sky or invisibly present within the world
temples were their main means of contact with humanity
each day it was believed the gods moved from the divine realm to their temples their homes in the human world
there they inhabited the cult images the statues that depicted deities and allowed humans to interact with them in temple rituals
this movement between realms was sometimes described as a journey between the sky and the earth
as temples were the focal points of egyptian cities the god in a city 's main temple was the patron god for the city and the surrounding region
deities spheres of influence on earth centered on the towns and regions they presided over
many gods had more than one cult center and their local ties changed over time
they could establish themselves in new cities or their range of influence could contract
therefore a given deity 's main cult center in historical times is not necessarily his or her place of origin
the political influence of a city could affect the importance of its patron deity
when kings from thebes took control of the country at start of the middle kingdom c
<year> – <year> bc they elevated thebes patron gods — first the war god montu and then amun — to national prominence
in keeping with this belief the names of deities often relate to their roles or origins
the name of the predatory goddess sekhmet means powerful one the name of the mysterious god amun means hidden one and the name of the goddess nekhbet who was worshipped in the city of nekheb means she of nekheb
but many other names have no certain meaning even when the gods who bear them are closely tied to a single role
the names of the sky goddess nut and the earth god geb do not resemble the egyptian terms for sky and earth
the egyptians also devised false etymologies giving more meanings to divine names
a passage in the coffin texts renders the name of the funerary god sokar as sk r meaning cleaning of the mouth to link his name with his role in the opening of the mouth ritual while one in the pyramid texts says the name is based on words shouted by osiris connecting sokar with the most important funerary deity
the gods were believed to have many names
among them were secret names that conveyed their true natures more profoundly than others
to know the true name of a deity was to have power over it
the importance of names is demonstrated by a myth in which isis poisons the superior god ra and refuses to cure him unless he reveals his secret name to her
upon learning the name she tells it to her son horus and by learning it they gain greater knowledge and power
in addition to their names gods were given epithets like possessor of splendor ruler of abydos or lord of the sky that describe some aspect of their roles or their worship
because of the gods multiple and overlapping roles deities can have many epithets — with more important gods accumulating more titles — and the same epithet can apply to many deities
some epithets eventually became separate deities as with werethekau an epithet applied to several goddesses meaning great enchantress which came to be treated as an independent goddess
the host of divine names and titles expresses the gods multifarious nature
a god 's connections and interactions with other deities helped define its character
thus isis as the mother and protector of horus was a great healer as well as the patroness of kings
such relationships were the base material from which myths were formed
family relationships are a common type of connection between gods
deities often form male and female pairs reflecting the importance of procreation in egyptian religious thought
families of three deities with a father mother and child represent the creation of new life and the succession of the father by the child a pattern that connects divine families with royal succession
osiris isis and horus formed the quintessential family of this type
the pattern they set grew more widespread over time so that many deities in local cult centers like ptah sekhmet and their child nefertum at memphis and amun mut and khonsu at thebes were assembled into family triads
genealogical connections like these are changeable in keeping with the multiple perspectives in egyptian belief
hathor as a fertility goddess could act as mother to any child god including the child form of the sun god although in other circumstances she was the sun god 's daughter
other divine groups were composed of deities with interrelated roles or who together represented a region of the egyptian mythological cosmos
there were sets of gods for the hours of the day and night and for each nome province of egypt
some of these groups contain a specific symbolically important number of deities
paired gods can stand for opposite but interrelated concepts that are part of a greater unity
ra who is dynamic and light @-@ producing and osiris who is static and shrouded in darkness merge into a single god each night
groups of three are linked with plurality in ancient egyptian thought and groups of four connote completeness
rulers in the late new kingdom promoted a particularly important group of three gods above all others amun ra and ptah
these deities stood for the plurality of all gods as well as for their own cult centers the major cities of thebes heliopolis and memphis and for many threefold sets of concepts in egyptian religious thought
sometimes set the patron god of the nineteenth dynasty kings and the embodiment of disorder within the world was added to this group which emphasized a single coherent vision of the pantheon
nine the product of three and three represents a multitude so the egyptians called several large groups enneads or sets of nine even if they had more than nine members
the most prominent ennead was the ennead of heliopolis an extended family of deities descended from the creator god atum which incorporates many important gods
the term ennead was often extended to include all of egypt 's deities
this divine assemblage had a vague and changeable hierarchy
gods with broad influence in the cosmos or who were mythologically older than others had higher positions in divine society
at the apex of this society was the king of the gods who was usually identified with the creator deity
in different periods of egyptian history different gods were most frequently said to hold this exalted position
horus was the most important god in the early dynastic period ra rose to preeminence in the old kingdom amun was supreme in the new and in the ptolemaic and roman periods isis was the divine queen and creator goddess
newly prominent gods tended to adopt characteristics from their predecessors
isis absorbed the traits of many other goddesses during her rise and when amun became the ruler of the pantheon he was conjoined with ra the traditional king of the gods to become a solar deity
the egyptians had complex conception of the human soul consisting of several parts
the spirits of the gods were composed of many of these same elements
the ba was the component of the human or divine soul that affected the world around it
any visible manifestation of a god 's power could be called its ba thus the sun was called the ba of ra
a depiction of a deity was considered a ka another component of its being which acted as a vessel for that deity 's ba to inhabit
the cult images of gods that were the focus of temple rituals as well as the sacred animals that represented certain deities were believed to house divine bas in this way
gods could be ascribed many bas and kas which were sometimes given names representing different aspects of the god 's nature
everything in existence was said to be one of the kas of atum the creator god who originally contained all things within himself and one deity could be called the ba of another meaning that the first god is a manifestation of the other 's power
divine body parts could act as separate deities like the eye of ra and hand of atum both of which were personified as goddesses
nationally important deities gave rise to local manifestations which sometimes absorbed the characteristics of older regional gods
horus had many forms tied to particular places including horus of nekhen horus of buhen and horus of edfu
such local manifestations could be treated almost as separate beings
during the new kingdom one man was accused of stealing clothes by an oracle supposed to communicate messages from amun of pe @-@ khenty
he consulted two other local oracles of amun hoping for a different judgment
gods manifestations also differed according to their roles
horus could be a powerful sky god or vulnerable child and these forms were sometimes counted as independent deities
gods were combined with each other as easily as they were divided
a god could be called the ba of another or two or more deities could be joined into one god with a combined name and iconography
local gods were linked with greater ones and deities with similar functions were combined
ra was connected with the local deity sobek to form sobek @-@ ra with his fellow ruling god amun to form amun @-@ ra with the solar form of horus to form ra @-@ horakhty and with several solar deities as horemakhet @-@ khepri @-@ ra @-@ atum
on rare occasion even deities of different sexes were joined in this way producing combinations like osiris @-@ neith and mut @-@ min
this linking of deities is called syncretism
unlike other situations for which this term is used the egyptian practice was not meant to fuse competing belief systems although foreign deities could be syncretized with native ones
instead syncretism acknowledged the overlap between their roles and extended the sphere of influence for each of them
syncretic combinations were not permanent a god who was involved in one combination continued to appear separately and to form new combinations with other deities
but closely connected deities did sometimes merge
horus absorbed several falcon gods from various regions such as khenty @-@ irty and khenty @-@ khety who became little more than local manifestations of him hathor subsumed a similar cow goddess bat and an early funerary god khenti @-@ amentiu was supplanted by osiris and anubis
<num> – <num> bc in the mid @-@ new kingdom a single solar deity the aten became the sole focus of the state religion
akhenaten ceased to fund the temples of other deities and erased the gods names and images on monuments targeting amun in particular
this new religious system sometimes called atenism differed dramatically from the polytheistic worship of many gods in all other periods
whereas in earlier times newly important gods were integrated into existing religious beliefs atenism insisted on a single understanding of the divine that excluded the traditional multiplicity of perspectives
yet atenism may not have been full monotheism which totally excludes belief in other deities
there is evidence suggesting that the general populace was still allowed to worship other gods in private
the picture is further complicated by atenism 's apparent tolerance for some other deities like shu
for these reasons the egyptologist dominic montserrat suggested that akhenaten may have been monolatrous worshipping a single deity while acknowledging the existence of others
in any case atenism 's aberrant theology did not take root among the egyptian populace and akhenaten 's successors returned to traditional beliefs
reasons for this debate include the practice of syncretism which might suggest that all the separate gods could ultimately merge into one and the tendency of egyptian texts to credit a particular god with power that surpasses all other deities
another point of contention is the appearance of the word god in wisdom literature where the term does not refer to a specific deity or group of deities
in the early <num> century for instance e
a
wallis budge believed that egyptian commoners were polytheistic but knowledge of the true monotheistic nature of the religion was reserved for the elite who wrote the wisdom literature
his contemporary james henry breasted thought egyptian religion was instead pantheistic with the power of the sun god present in all other gods while hermann junker argued that egyptian civilization had been originally monotheistic and became polytheistic in the course of its history
in <year> erik hornung published a study rebutting these views
he points out that in any given period many deities even minor ones were described as superior to all others
he also argues that the unspecified god in the wisdom texts is a generic term for whichever deity the reader chooses to revere
although the combinations manifestations and iconographies of each god were constantly shifting they were always restricted to a finite number of forms never becoming fully interchangeable in a monotheistic or pantheistic way
henotheism hornung says describes egyptian religion better than other labels
an egyptian could worship any deity at a particular time and credit it with supreme power in that moment without denying the other gods or merging them all with the god that he or she focused on
hornung concludes that the gods were fully unified only in myth at the time before creation after which the multitude of gods emerged from a uniform nonexistence
hornung 's arguments have greatly influenced other scholars of egyptian religion but some still believe that at times the gods were more unified than he allows
jan assmann maintains that the notion of a single deity developed slowly through the new kingdom beginning with a focus on amun @-@ ra as the all @-@ important sun god
in his view atenism was an extreme outgrowth of this trend
it equated the single deity with the sun and dismissed all other gods
then in the backlash against atenism priestly theologians described the universal god in a different way one that coexisted with traditional polytheism
the one god was believed to transcend the world and all the other deities while at the same time the multiple gods were aspects of the one
according to assmann this one god was especially equated with amun the dominant god in the late new kingdom whereas for the rest of egyptian history the universal deity could be identified with many other gods
james p
allen says that coexisting notions of one god and many gods would fit well with the multiplicity of approaches in egyptian thought as well as with the henotheistic practice of ordinary worshippers
he says that the egyptians may have recognized the unity of the divine by identifying their uniform notion of god with a particular god depending on the particular situation
they are made of precious materials their flesh is gold their bones are silver and their hair is lapis lazuli
they give off a scent that the egyptians likened to the incense used in rituals
some texts give precise descriptions of particular deities including their height and eye color
yet these characteristics are not fixed in myths gods change their appearances to suit their own purposes
egyptian texts often refer to deities true underlying forms as mysterious
the egyptians visual representations of their gods are therefore not literal
they symbolize specific aspects of each deity 's character functioning much like the ideograms in hieroglyphic writing
for this reason the funerary god anubis is commonly shown in egyptian art as a dog or jackal a creature whose scavenging habits threaten the preservation of buried mummies in an effort to counter this threat and employ it for protection
his black coloring alludes to the color of mummified flesh and to the fertile black soil that egyptians saw as a symbol of resurrection
most gods were depicted in several ways
hathor could be a cow cobra lioness or a woman with bovine horns or ears
by depicting a given god in different ways the egyptians expressed different aspects of its essential nature
the gods are depicted in a finite number of these symbolic forms so that deities can often be distinguished from one another by their iconographies
these forms include men and women anthropomorphism animals zoomorphism and more rarely inanimate objects
combinations of forms such as gods with human bodies and animal heads are common
new forms and increasingly complex combinations arose in the course of history
some gods can only be distinguished from others if they are labeled in writing as with isis and hathor
because of the close connection between these goddesses they could both wear the cow @-@ horn headdress that was originally hathor 's alone
certain features of divine images are more useful than others in determining a god 's identity
the head of a given divine image is particularly significant
in a hybrid image the head represents the original form of the being depicted so that as the egyptologist henry fischer put it a lion @-@ headed goddess is a lion @-@ goddess in human form while a royal sphinx conversely is a man who has assumed the form of a lion
divine headdresses which range from the same types of crowns used by human kings to large hieroglyphs worn on gods heads are another important indicator
in contrast the objects held in gods hands tend to be generic
male deities hold was staffs goddesses hold stalks of papyrus and both sexes carry ankh signs representing the egyptian word for life to symbolize their life @-@ giving power
the forms in which the gods are shown although diverse are limited in many ways
many creatures that are widespread in egypt were never used in divine iconography whereas a few such as falcons cobras and cattle can each represent many deities
animals that were absent from egypt in the early stages of its history were not used as divine images
for instance the horse which was only introduced in the second intermediate period c
<year> – <year> bc never represented a god
similarly the clothes worn by anthropomorphic deities in all periods changed little from the styles used in the old kingdom a kilt false beard and often a shirt for male gods and a long tight @-@ fitting dress for goddesses
the basic anthropomorphic form varies
child gods are depicted nude as are some adult gods when their procreative powers are emphasized
certain male deities are given heavy bellies and breasts signifying either androgyny or prosperity and abundance
whereas most male gods have red skin and most goddesses are yellow — the same colors used to depict egyptian men and women — some are given unusual symbolic skin colors
thus the blue skin and paunchy figure of the god hapi alludes to the nile flood he represents and the nourishing fertility it brought
a few deities such as osiris ptah and min have a mummiform appearance with their limbs tightly swathed in cloth
although these gods resemble mummies the earliest examples predate the cloth @-@ wrapped style of mummification and this form may instead hark back to the earliest limbless depictions of deities
each pharaoh and his predecessors were considered the successors of the gods who had ruled egypt in mythic prehistory
living kings were equated with horus and called the son of many deities particularly osiris and ra deceased kings were equated with these elder gods
pharaohs had their own mortuary temples where rituals were performed for them during their lives and after their deaths
but few pharaohs were worshipped as gods long after their lifetimes and non @-@ official texts portray kings in a human light
for these reasons scholars disagree about how genuinely most egyptians believed the king to be a god
he may only have been considered divine when he was performing ceremonies
however much it was believed the king 's divine status was the rationale for his role as egypt 's representative to the gods as he formed a link between the divine and human realms
the egyptians believed the gods needed temples to dwell in as well as the periodic performance of rituals and presentation of offerings to nourish them
these things were provided by the cults that the king oversaw with their priests and laborers
yet according to royal ideology temple @-@ building was exclusively the pharaoh 's work as were the rituals that priests usually performed in his stead
these acts were a part of the king 's fundamental role maintaining maat
the king and the nation he represented provided the gods with maat so they could continue to perform their functions which maintained maat in the cosmos so humans could continue to live
in literature gods may appear to humans in a physical form but in real life the egyptians were limited to more indirect means of communication
the ba of a god was said to periodically leave the divine realm to dwell in the images of that god
by inhabiting these images the gods left their concealed state and took on a physical form
to the egyptians a place or object that was ḏsr — sacred — was isolated and ritually pure and thus fit for a god to inhabit
temple statues and reliefs as well as particular sacred animals like the apis bull served as divine intermediaries in this way
dreams and trances provided a very different venue for interaction
in these states it was believed people could come close to the gods and sometimes receive messages from them
finally according to egyptian afterlife beliefs human souls pass into the divine realm after death
the egyptians therefore believed that in death they would exist on the same level as the gods and fully understand their mysterious nature
temples where the state rituals were carried out were filled with images of the gods
the most important temple image was the cult statue in the inner sanctuary
these statues were usually less than life @-@ size and made of the same precious materials that were said to form the gods bodies
many temples had several sanctuaries each with a cult statue representing one of the gods in a group such as a family triad
the city 's primary god was envisioned as its lord employing many of the residents as servants in the divine household that the temple represented
the gods residing in the temples of egypt collectively represented the entire pantheon
but many deities — including some important gods as well as those that were minor or hostile — were never given temples of their own although some were represented in the temples of other gods
to insulate the sacred power in the sanctuary from the impurities of the outside world the egyptians enclosed temple sanctuaries and greatly restricted access to them
people other than kings and high priests were thus denied contact with cult statues
the only exception was during festival processions when the statue was carried out of the temple but still enclosed in a portable shrine
people did have less direct means of interaction
the more public parts of temples often incorporated small places for prayer from doorways to freestanding chapels near the back of the temple building
communities also built and managed small chapels for their own use and some families had shrines inside their homes
despite the gulf that separated humanity from the divine the egyptians were surrounded by opportunities to approach their gods
this divine influence applied mainly to egypt as foreign peoples were traditionally believed to be outside the divine order
but in the new kingdom when other nations were under egyptian control foreigners were said to be under the sun god 's benign rule in the same way that egyptians were
thoth as the overseer of time was said to allot fixed lifespans to both humans and gods
other gods were also said to govern the length of human lives including meskhenet who presided over birth and shai the personification of fate
thus the time and manner of death was the main meaning of the egyptian concept of fate although to some extent these deities governed other events in life as well
several texts refer to gods influencing or inspiring human decisions working through a person 's heart — the seat of emotion and intellect in egyptian belief
deities were also believed to give commands instructing the king in the governance of his realm and regulating the management of their temples
egyptian texts rarely mention direct commands given to private persons and these commands never evolved into a set of divinely enforced moral codes
morality in ancient egypt was based on the concept of maat which when applied to human society meant that everyone should live in an orderly way that did not interfere with the well @-@ being of other people
because deities were the upholders of maat morality was connected with them
for example the gods judged humans moral righteousness after death and by the new kingdom a verdict of innocence in this judgment was believed to be necessary for admittance into the afterlife
but in general morality was based on practical ways to uphold maat in daily life rather than on strict rules that the gods laid out
humans had free will to ignore divine guidance and the behavior required by maat but by doing so they could bring divine punishment upon themselves
a deity carried out this punishment using its ba the force that manifested the god 's power in the human world
natural disasters and human ailments were seen as the work of angry divine bas
conversely the gods could cure righteous people of illness or even extend their lifespans
both these types of intervention were eventually represented by deities shed who emerged in the new kingdom to represent divine rescue from harm and petbe an apotropaic god from the late eras of egyptian history who was believed to avenge wrongdoing
egyptian texts take different views on whether the gods are responsible when humans suffer unjustly
misfortune was often seen as a product of isfet the cosmic disorder that was the opposite of maat and therefore the gods were not guilty of causing evil events
some deities who were closely connected with isfet such as set could be blamed for disorder within the world without placing guilt on the other gods
but some writings do accuse the deities of causing human misery while others give theodicies in the gods defense
beginning in the middle kingdom several texts connected the issue of evil in the world with a myth in which the creator god fights a human rebellion against his rule and then withdraws from the earth
because of this human misbehavior the creator is distant from his creation allowing suffering to exist
new kingdom writings do not question the just nature of the gods as strongly as those of the middle kingdom
they emphasize humans direct personal relationships with deities and the gods power to intervene in human events
people in this era put faith in specific gods who they hoped would help and protect them through their lives
as a result upholding the ideals of maat grew less important than gaining the gods favor as a way to guarantee a good life
even the pharaohs were regarded as dependent on divine aid and after the new kingdom came to an end government was increasingly influenced by oracles communicating the gods will
official religion involved a variety of rituals based in temples
some rites were performed every day whereas others were festivals taking place at longer intervals and often limited to a particular temple or deity
the gods received their offerings in daily ceremonies in which their statues were clothed anointed and presented with food as hymns were recited in their honor
these offerings in addition to maintaining maat for the gods celebrated deities life @-@ giving generosity and encouraged them to remain benevolent rather than vengeful
festivals often involved a ceremonial procession in which a cult image was carried out of the temple in a barque @-@ shaped shrine
these processions served various purposes
in roman times when local deities of all kinds were believed to have power over the nile inundation processions in many communities carried temple images to the riverbanks so the gods could invoke a large and fruitful flood
processions also traveled between temples as when the image of hathor from dendera temple visited her consort horus at the temple of edfu
rituals for a god were often based in that deity 's mythology
such rituals were meant to be repetitions of the events of the mythic past renewing the beneficial effects of the original events
in the khoiak festival in honor of osiris his death and resurrection were ritually reenacted at a time when crops were beginning to sprout
the returning greenery symbolized the renewal of the god 's own life
personal interaction with the gods took many forms
people who wanted information or advice consulted oracles run by temples that were supposed to convey gods answers to questions
amulets and other images of protective deities were used to ward off the demons that might threaten human well @-@ being or to impart the god 's positive characteristics to the wearer
private rituals invoked the gods power to accomplish personal goals from healing sickness to cursing enemies
these practices used heka the same force of magic that the gods used which the creator was said to have given to humans so they could fend off misfortune
the performer of a private rite often took on the role of a god in a myth or even threatened a deity to involve the gods in accomplishing the goal
such rituals coexisted with private offerings and prayers and all three were accepted means of obtaining divine help
prayer and private offerings are generally called personal piety acts that reflect a close relationship between an individual and a god
evidence of personal piety is scant before the new kingdom
votive offerings and personal names many of which are theophoric suggest that commoners felt some connection between themselves and their gods
but firm evidence of devotion to deities became visible only in the new kingdom reaching a peak late in that era
scholars disagree about the meaning of this change — whether direct interaction with the gods was a new development or an outgrowth of older traditions
egyptians now expressed their devotion through a new variety of activities in and around temples
they recorded their prayers and their thanks for divine help on stelae
they gave offerings of figurines that represented the gods they were praying to or that symbolized the result they desired thus a relief image of hathor and a statuette of a woman could both represent a prayer for fertility
occasionally a person took a particular god as a patron dedicating his or her property or labor to the god 's cult
these practices continued into the latest periods of egyptian history
these later eras saw more religious innovations including the practice of giving animal mummies as offerings to deities depicted in animal form such as the cat mummies given to the feline goddess bastet
some of the major deities from myth and official religion were rarely invoked in popular worship but many of the great state gods were important in popular tradition
the worship of some egyptian gods spread to neighboring lands especially to canaan and nubia during the new kingdom when those regions were under pharaonic control
in canaan the exported deities including hathor amun and set were often syncretized with native gods who in turn spread to egypt
the egyptian deities may not have had permanent temples in canaan and their importance there waned after egypt lost control of the region
in contrast many temples to the major egyptian gods and deified pharaohs were built in nubia
after the end of egyptian rule there the imported gods particularly amun and isis were syncretized with local deities and remained part of the religion of nubia 's independent kingdom of kush
these gods were incorporated into the nubian ideology of kingship much as they were in egypt so that amun was considered the divine father of the king and isis and other goddesses were linked with the nubian queen the kandake
some deities reached farther
taweret became a goddess in minoan crete and amun 's oracle at siwa oasis was known to and consulted by people across the mediterranean region
under the greek ptolemaic dynasty and then roman rule greeks and romans introduced their own deities to egypt
these newcomers equated the egyptian gods with their own as part of the greco @-@ roman tradition of interpretatio graeca
but the worship of the native gods was not swallowed up by that of foreign ones
instead greek and roman gods were adopted as manifestations of egyptian ones
egyptian cults sometimes incorporated greek language philosophy iconography and even temple architecture
meanwhile the cults of several egyptian deities — particularly isis osiris anubis the form of horus named harpocrates and the fused greco @-@ egyptian god serapis — were adopted into roman religion and spread across the roman empire
roman emperors like ptolemaic kings before them invoked isis and serapis to endorse their authority inside and outside egypt
in the empire 's complex mix of religious traditions thoth was transmuted into the legendary esoteric teacher hermes trismegistus and isis who was venerated from britain to mesopotamia became the focus of a greek @-@ style mystery cult
isis and hermes trismegistus were both prominent in the western esoteric tradition that grew from the roman religious world
temples and cults in egypt itself declined as the roman economy deteriorated in the third century ad and beginning in the fourth century christians suppressed the veneration of egyptian deities
the last formal cults at philae died out in the fifth or sixth century
most beliefs surrounding the gods themselves disappeared within a few hundred years remaining in magical texts into the seventh and eighth centuries
but many of the practices involved in their worship such as processions and oracles were adapted to fit christian ideology and persisted as part of the coptic church
given the great changes and diverse influences in egyptian culture since that time scholars disagree about whether any modern coptic practices are descended from those of pharaonic religion
but many festivals and other traditions of modern egyptians both christian and muslim resemble the worship of their ancestors gods
released on july <num> <year> the album was the band 's second collaboration with record producer rick rubin whose production skills on slayer 's previous album reign in blood had helped the band 's sound evolve
south of heaven was slayer 's second album to enter the billboard <num> and its last to be released by def jam recordings although the album became an american recordings album after rick rubin ended his partnership with russell simmons
it was one of only two def jam titles to be distributed by geffen records through warner bros
records because of original distributor columbia records refusal to release work by the band
the release peaked at number <num> and in <year> was awarded a gold certification by the recording industry association of america
in order to offset the pace of the group 's previous album slayer deliberately slowed down the album 's tempo
in contrast to their previous albums the band utilized undistorted guitars and toned @-@ down vocals
while some critics praised this musical change others — more accustomed to the style of earlier releases — were disappointed
the songs mandatory suicide and the title track however have become permanent features of the band 's live setlist
popmatters reviewer adrien begrand observed that rubin 's production shoves dave lombardo 's drumming right up front in the mix
guitarist jeff hanneman has since said that south of heaven was the only album the band members discussed before writing the music
aware that they couldn 't top reign in blood and that whatever they recorded would be compared to that album he believed they had to slow down something slayer had never done on albums before or since
guitarist kerry king cited the need to keep people guessing as another reason for the musical shift
in order to contrast the aggressive assault put forth on reign in blood slayer consciously slowed down the tempo of the album as a whole according to slayer 's official biography
they also added elements like undistorted guitars and toned @-@ down vocal styles not heard on previous albums
king has since been critical of his performance which he describes as his most lackluster
king attributes this to the fact he had recently married and moved to phoenix arizona
describing himself as probably the odd man out at that point he admitted he didn ’ t participate as much because of that
hanneman said we go through dry spells sometimes but the good thing about having two guitar players that can write music is that you are never gonna go without
i guess at that time kerry was hitting a dry spell
king has also been critical of the album in general describing it as one of his least favorite slayer albums
he feels vocalist tom araya moved too far away from his regular vocal style and added too much singing
drummer dave lombardo has since observed there was fire on all the records but it started dimming when south of heaven came into the picture
and that 's me personally
again i was probably wanting something else
judas priest 's dissident aggressor is the only cover version to appear on a slayer studio album
the song was chosen due to its war @-@ themed lyrics
hanneman described the track as more just like one of those odd songs that a lot of people didn 't know but it was a favorite of kerry and i so we just picked that one
meanwhile cleanse the soul has been heavily criticized by king who said that he hates the track that 's one of the black marks in our history in my book
i just fucking think it 's horrible
laughs i hate the opening riff
it 's what we call a happy riff
it 's just like la @-@ lala @-@ la @-@ la @-@ la
i can 't see myself playing it but after that where it gets heavier i like that section
if we ever did a medley i 'd put part of that in there
the slayer boxset soundtrack to the apocalypse featured along with four songs of the album an early version of the title track recorded at hanneman 's home
photographer glen e
friedman took the promotional shot which surfaced as the back cover of south of heaven around the time of <year> 's reign in blood
lombardo felt it made slayer seem as though they had matured a little bit while friedman himself deemed it a really cool back cover and one of the most classic shots of them slayer ever
when label co @-@ founders russell simmons and rubin parted ways slayer signed to rubin 's newly founded def american recordings label
the album peaked at number <num> on the billboard <num> album chart and on november <num> <year> became slayer 's second album to be certified gold in the united states
south of heaven was awarded silver certification in the united kingdom on january <num> <year> slayer 's first record to do so in that country
slayer 's official biography states that some critics praised the album as demonstrating slayer 's desire to grow musically and avoid repeating themselves
alex henderson of allmusic described the record as disturbing and powerful while joe matera of ultimate guitar deemed the album a slight departure he wrote that while the pace was slowed down it didn 't sacrifice any of the heaviness inherent in slayer 's music
reviewing the <year> slayer box set soundtrack to the apocalypse adrien begrand of popmatters described the album as their most underrated and on this set its five selections show how highly the band thinks of the record
knac
com 's peter atkinson was also positive saying the album has a grandiosity and imposing presence which makes the record so magnificent
grave 's ola lindgren and bolt thrower 's karl willetts both rate south of heaven as amongst the top five albums of all time while max kolesne of brazilian death metal group krisiun remembers hearing the song silent scream for the first time it just blew me away
it was like fast double @-@ bass fast kicks during the whole song
that was very inspiring for me
when discussing slayer in an october <year> interview evile frontman matt drake stated that while reign in blood was just speed south of heaven proved that the group could write slow material as well
metal forces reviewer gives the band credit for at least making an effort to try something new and not being afraid to experiment at such a crucial stage of their career creating one of the more original sounding thrash speed metal albums he heard in a long while
he remarks however that if you ’ re expecting to hear reign in blood part two you ’ ll be in for a major disappointment
kim neely of rolling stone dismissed the album as genuinely offensive satanic drivel
slayer 's official biography states the new sounds disappointed some of the band 's fans who were more accustomed to the style of earlier releases
michael roberts of westworld online said this was due to some of the numbers moving at the sludgier speed of black sabbath
araya commented that the album was a late bloomer — it wasn 't really received well but it kind of grew on everybody later
toni ferguson recorded string quartet adaptations of both tracks on the album the string quartet tribute to slayer the evil you dread with the former cover being described as having menacing chord shifts by allmusic 's johnny loftus
<year> slayer tribute album slatanic slaughter featured three tracks which originally appeared on south of heaven with the title track mandatory suicide and spill the blood interpreted by cemetary crown of thorns and grope respectively
its <year> follow up slatanic slaughter vol
<num> only featured two tracks originally from the album namely silent scream arranged by vader and read between the lies interpreted by anathema
<year> 's straight to hell a tribute to slayer collected four slayer renditions which originated on the album with versions of south of heaven performed by abaddon venom and electric hellfire club mandatory suicide cut by chapter <num> and behind the crooked cross adapted by gigantor
<year> argentine tribute album al sur del abismo tributo argentino a slayer saw nafak and climatic terra also respectively cover south of heaven and mandatory suicide
hatebreed covered the song ghosts of war for their <year> cover album for the lions
they released a music video for it also
korn has covered the title track at least twice live once with kid rock on vocals and another using the intro to follow into one of their songs live
the title track itself has also been covered by integrity <year> modest mouse and califone pro @-@ pain and universe eye
polish death metal band decapitated covered the song mandatory suicide on their first full @-@ length album winds of creation
in <year> silent scream was covered by children of bodom for their album hate crew deathroll in his uk version
lombardo guested with finnish cellist group apocalyptica on a live medley of the two tracks at <year> 's headbanger 's heaven festival in the netherlands
adrien begrand of popmatters described south of heaven as an unorthodox set opener in theory noting the song went over like a megaton bomb detonating the place dozens of inverted crosses projected behind the high drum riser the sinewy opening notes kicked in followed by an overture of bass cymbal crashes and tom fills leading up to the slowly building crescendo in a concert review
lombardo remembers listening to a live rendition of south of heaven and thinking ‘ man there 's just so much groove in that song
’ to my kids i was saying ‘ listen to that listen to how groovy that is ’ and it 's heavy
a rare live version of the track featured on the jägermusic rarities <year> promotional cd given away to attendees at the spring <year> jägermeister music tour
a live rendition of south of heaven was also included on a bonus dvd which came with the group 's <year> re @-@ release of ninth studio album christ illusion shot in vancouver british columbia during <year> 's unholy alliance tour
behind the crooked cross is rarely played live as hanneman hates the track though king has always wanted to play it because it 's got a cool intro despite it not being his favorite song
king said that 's fine when speaking of the situation noting there are songs that he wants to play that i always shoot down
ghosts of war isn 't king 's favorite song either which he attests everybody always wants to hear performed live
he confessed i like the ending you know i like the big heavy part and i always say ‘ let 's put the heavy ending at the end of chemical warfare and just do the last half
’ but i could never make that fly
slayer has toyed with the idea of creating a live set mixed with selections from the album and <year> 's seasons in the abyss though hanneman said it 's something which hasn 't been seriously considered
metal maniacs asked slayer in a <year> interview whether they would consider playing south of heaven in the footsteps of the still reigning tour to which araya replied it 's becoming a trendy thing now
i don 't know
we have some really cool albums but i don 't think we 'll ever do that again
king was equally unsure commenting probably not
and i just don 't like enough songs off south of heaven
although the international civil aviation organization icao excludes any form of remunerated aviation from its definition some commercial operations are often included within the scope of general aviation ga in the uk
the sector operates business jets rotorcraft piston and jet @-@ engined fixed @-@ wing aircraft gliders of all descriptions and lighter than air craft
public transport operations include business or corporate aviation and air taxi services and account for nearly half of the economic contribution made by the sector
other commercial ga activities are aerial work such as surveying and air ambulances and flight training which plays an important role in the supply of pilots to the commercial air transport cat industry
private flying is conducted for personal transport and recreation
it includes a strong vintage aircraft movement and encompasses a range of air sports such as racing aerobatics and parachuting at which british teams and individuals have succeeded in international competition
of the <num> @,@ <num> civil aircraft registered in the uk <num> per cent are engaged in ga operations and annually the ga fleet accounts for between <num>
<num> and <num>
<num> million hours flown
the single most common class of aircraft is the fixed @-@ wing light aircraft associated with traditional ga but the main area of growth over the last <num> years has been in the use of more affordable aircraft such as microlights amateur built aeroplanes and smaller helicopters
there are <num> @,@ <num> private pilot licence holders and <num> @,@ <num> certified glider pilots
some of the <num> @,@ <num> pilots who hold professional licences are also engaged in ga activities
although ga operates from more than <num> @,@ <num> aerodromes and landing sites ranging in size from large regional airports to farm strips over <num> per cent of ga activity is conducted at <num> of the larger aerodromes
the ga industry which is around <num> per cent the size of its cat cousin employs <num> @,@ <num> people and contributes £ <num>
<num> billion to the uk economy
ga is regulated by the civil aviation authority caa although regulatory powers are being increasingly transferred to the european aviation safety agency easa
the main focus is on standards of airworthiness and pilot licensing and the objective is to promote high standards of safety
at the lighter end of the ga spectrum some regulatory authority is devolved to representative bodies and gliding is in transition from a self @-@ regulatory model to more formal governance by easa
airspace regulation necessary to protect an increasing number of cat operations has reduced the area in which ga flights can be freely conducted
the growth in cat is also making access to larger airports more difficult for the ga sector and smaller aerodromes are vulnerable to closure and re @-@ development for more profitable uses
the uk planning system has no remit to consider the national significance of ga public transport operations and generally does not favour the development of smaller aerodromes catering to the ga market
the planning process has become a mechanism for addressing local aerodrome @-@ related environmental issues which particularly regarding noise are the main subjects of public criticism levelled at ga
it defines commercial air transport cat as an aircraft operation involving the transport of passengers cargo or mail for remuneration or hire and aerial work as an aircraft operation in which an aircraft is used for specialized services such as agriculture construction photography surveying observation and patrol search and rescue aerial advertisement etc
organisations in the united kingdom uk describe ga in less restrictive terms that include elements of commercial aviation
the british business and general aviation association interprets it to be all aeroplane and helicopter flying except that performed by the major airlines and the armed services
the general aviation awareness council applies the description all civil aviation operations other than scheduled air services and non @-@ scheduled air transport operations for remuneration or hire
for the purposes of a strategic review of ga in the uk the civil aviation authority caa defined the scope of ga as a civil aircraft operation other than a commercial air transport flight operating to a schedule and considered it necessary to depart from the icao definition and include aerial work and minor cat operations
in <year> the aero club was granted the royal prefix took responsibility for controlling all private flying in the uk and started issuing the first british pilot licences
the introduction of the de havilland dh
<num> moth in <year> revolutionised light aviation and the royal aero club recognising the vital necessity of promoting civil flying formed the light aeroplane club scheme
between <year> and <year> around <num> flying clubs were started and more than <num> @,@ <num> pilots were trained
during world war ii civil aerodromes were taken over for military use existing military airfields were expanded and new ones were built
this resulted in a significant inventory of facilities becoming available after the war
pre @-@ war civil aerodromes for example sywell were returned to civilian use
surplus military airfields were closed and in some cases for example beccles subsequently re @-@ opened as civil aerodromes
the ministry of civil aviation was created to regulate all civil aviation in the uk and this task remained the responsibility of government departments until the establishment of the independent caa in <year>
with an expanded infrastructure in place ga became established after the war when manufacturers such as cessna and piper introduced light aircraft designed for the private market
the cessna <num> developed from the late <num> cessna <num> was introduced in <year> and became the world 's best selling single @-@ engine aeroplane
single piston @-@ engine aircraft are still the most common class of aircraft in the uk ga fleet
the development of the rogallo wing in the <num> fostered the development of hang @-@ gliding during the <num> and <num>
the <num> also saw experiments with motorised hang gliders but it was not until the <num> that this blend of technologies started to mature resulting in the birth of the microlight movement
another milestone in the development of ga was the <year> introduction of the learjet <num>
although it was not the first business jet it popularised corporate aviation and established the personal jet as a whole new class of aircraft
flights can be broadly categorised as public transport aerial work and private flying the first two of which are commercial activities
some are however closely aligned to and considered part of the ga sector
public transport operations are non @-@ scheduled on @-@ demand services flying between points specified by the customer providing a more flexible service than airline travel
air taxi operations offer charter services for third parties and business or corporate aviation uses company @-@ owned aircraft to transport employees and clients
aircraft used in these operations include business jets helicopters and twin piston @-@ engine aeroplanes carrying between six and ten people
an example of this type of operation is the transport by helicopter of spectators to the british formula one grand prix at silverstone
this involves so many flights that according to cranfield aviation services on race day the heliport is temporarily the world 's busiest airport
aerial work is a small but important component of the commercial ga sector characterised in its simplest form as remunerated non @-@ transport activities such as surveying crop spraying and emergency services work air ambulance and police
they make widespread use of fixed @-@ wing light aircraft associated with traditional ga not only for flying lessons but also as club aircraft rented out to qualified pilots for recreational flights
school @-@ owned aircraft account for a significant amount of ga activity both in terms of hours flown and aircraft movements
the pilot training element is regarded by the ga community as a key benefit that is critical to the supply of pilots for the airline industry
it is claimed by the general aviation awareness council that <num> – <num> per cent of professional pilots have self @-@ financed their flight training at ga schools and one uk airline operator has stated that the industry must rely on <num> – <num> per cent of new pilots coming from the ga sector
the caa estimates that between <year> and <year> the number of new professional pilots following the unsponsored training route rose from <num> per cent to <num> per cent
the counter argument to this claim is that pilots can be trained outside of the uk and that the airline industry is not therefore dependent on a healthy ga sector in the uk for its supply of pilots
the caa concludes that a severe reduction in ga would give some merit to the argument that pilot recruitment would be threatened but that the data on flying hours does not support such a gloomy outlook
of course reliance on other countries for pilot training means that the uk foregoes the economic benefit of the training activity
a survey of pilots conducted between <year> and <year> indicated that the most common purposes of recreational flights were local flights near the base aerodrome visits to other aerodromes and day trips away
half of all flights landed at the same aerodrome they departed from and only <num> per cent involved an overnight stay away from home
private flying is most associated with the traditional form of factory @-@ produced two and four @-@ seater single piston @-@ engine training and touring aircraft
examples of these are the cessna <num> cessna <num> and piper pa28 cherokee all with their origins in the <num> and the more modern designs of cirrus
the average cost per hour to fly such aircraft has been estimated to be £ <num> compared to an estimated £ <num> per hour for gliders and a reported £ <num> per hour for microlights
recent trends have seen an increase in the use of microlights and also in recreational helicopter flying following the introduction of smaller and cheaper machines such as the robinson r22 and r44
another growth area in private flying in recent years has been in the use of amateur built aircraft such as the van 's aircraft rv @-@ <num> and the europa
there is a strong vintage aircraft movement in the uk with two @-@ thirds of the <num> registered historic aircraft active
these cover the whole spectrum of civil and military aviation examples being the de havilland dragon rapide airliner of the <num> and the world war ii wwii spitfire fighter
there are many post @-@ wwii aircraft which could also be considered historic under a looser definition including for example <num> ex @-@ military jets such as the hawker hunter
historic aircraft are regular exhibits at air displays which are claimed to be the second most popular spectator activity after football in the uk
regionals are local competitions organised and run by one of the bigger gliding clubs in the region and represent the entry level to glider racing
races are handicapped according to glider performance and normally take place over nine days
success in the regionals allows pilots to progress to the nationals where there are five classes of competition
these are based on glider performance the lowest being club class and then progressing through standard maximum <num> metres <num> ft wingspan and flaps not permitted <num> metres <num> ft as standard but flaps are permitted <num> metres <num> ft maximum <num> metres <num> ft wingspan and finally open @-@ class no restrictions
success at national level can lead to a place in the national team and competition at international level
in <year> the british gliding team was ranked number one and british pilots took two women 's world championships and the open class european championship
handicapped air racing is open to any propeller @-@ driven aircraft capable of maintaining a minimum speed of <num> miles <num> km per hour in level flight
races are a case of fly low fly fast turn left consisting of <num> – <num> laps round a <num> – <num> mile <num> – <num> km circuit
faster aircraft are handicapped by starting after slower aircraft the intention being that the race concludes with all aircraft diving for the finish line together
there are up to <num> races per year conducted at airfields in the uk france and the channel islands for prizes that include the schneider trophy and king 's cup and the season culminates with the british air racing and european air racing championships
aerobatic competitions take place for both powered aircraft and gliders with up to <num> events each year in the uk and ireland
starting at the beginner level pilots can move up to standard powered aircraft or sports glider levels and then on to intermediate advanced and finally unlimited classes
each step up requires a wider repertoire of aerobatic figures and progressively more performance from the aircraft
national championships are awarded annually at standard sports intermediate advanced powered aircraft only and unlimited levels and pilots who have reached advanced and unlimited levels are eligible for selection to represent the uk in international competition
parachute competitions are held at club regional national and international levels and include the disciplines of accuracy landings freefall gymnastics formation skydiving canopy formation freestyle and freeflying and skysurfing
british teams consistently win medals in canopy formation world championships and a british team took the <year> world championship in women 's <num> @-@ way formation skydiving
the caa strategic review of ga applies the term airport to locations which predominantly support large scale commercial operations and airfield to locations which predominantly support ga operations
the general aviation small aerodrome research study gasar analysed <num> aerodromes in england which come under the scope of ga classifying <num> into six types
these range in size from regional airports to the smallest farm strip although <num> per cent of ga flights operate from <num> of the larger aerodromes in the first four categories
the six types of aerodrome are described in size order as regional airports e
g
east midlands major ga airports e
g
oxford developed ga airfields e
g
andrewsfield basic ga airfields e
g
rufforth developed airstrips e
g
tilstock and basic airstrips e
g
chilbolton in hampshire
the actual criteria used to categorise aerodromes were complex using <num> different parameters backed up with a peer review by experienced ga pilots
airports generally have long fully lit hard @-@ surfaced runways full air traffic control and navigation and landing aids
they are usually located on urban fringes support commercial and business operations and often exclude certain types of light aircraft
at the more rurally located airfields the lighter end of aviation such as microlight and gliding activities becomes increasingly prevalent and there are few or no commercial operations other than flying schools
at this level runways are generally shorter and grass surfaces are increasingly common
navigation aids are increasingly scarce being more basic where they are available and informal ground to air radio communication replaces air traffic control
the smallest airfields are too small to feature on general purpose ordnance survey os maps and lack basic facilities such as fuel and maintenance
the majority of airstrips are basically single short grass runways with no supporting facilities although the presence of a hangar is not uncommon at the larger examples
they do not feature on os maps and are owned by private clubs or more commonly individuals
to be granted a licence an aerodrome operator must satisfy the caa that the physical conditions at the aerodrome and its environs are acceptable the scale of equipment and facilities provided are adequate for the flying activities which are expected to take place an effective safety management system is in place and that staff are competent and where necessary suitably qualified
aerodromes classified as developed ga airfields or larger by the gasar study are with few exceptions licensed
only two basic ga airfields silverstone and duxford are licensed and all airstrips are unlicensed
the light aviation airports study group a joint caa @-@ industry initiative was established in <year> to review the regulation of light aviation aerodromes
a particular focus of this group was a review of the restrictions placed on unlicensed aerodromes
the group concluded that the requirement for public transport operations to be conducted only from licensed aerodromes should be further reviewed in the context of corresponding international and european requirements
in <year> the ga fleet comprised <num> @,@ <num> fixed @-@ wing aircraft <num> @,@ <num> microlights <num> @,@ <num> helicopters <num> @,@ <num> airships balloons <num> @,@ <num> gliders and some <num> @,@ <num> hang gliders
estimates put the number of foreign @-@ registered ga aircraft based in the uk at <num>
the number of pilots licensed by the caa to fly powered aircraft in <year> was <num> @,@ <num> of whom <num> @,@ <num> held a private pilot licence
the remainder held professional pilot licences either a commercial pilot licence or an airline transport pilot licence although not all of these would be engaged in ga activities
in addition there are <num> @,@ <num> active glider pilots and estimates put the membership of aviation @-@ related sport and recreational associations at <num> @,@ <num>
the number of aerodromes that support ga in the uk is difficult to establish with certainty
pooleys <year> united kingdom flight guide lists <num> and the airplan flight equipment uk vfr flight guide <year> lists nearly <num>
lockyears farm strips and private airfields flight guide lists more than <num> landing sites
the gasar study estimates <num> @,@ <num> formal flying sites in england alone a figure which includes <num> sites known to planning authorities but not included in flight guides
it estimates another <num> informal sites known only to land owners customs and members of the enthusiast group air @-@ britain
the sector was estimated to employ nearly <num> @,@ <num> people and directly contribute £ <num>
<num> billion to the uk economy in <year> making it roughly seven per cent of the size of the cat industry
nearly half of the economic contribution was generated by business aviation
the lighter end of the ga spectrum microlights amateur built and airships and balloons have in particular shown strong growth although the last of these activities was severely curtailed during the foot @-@ and @-@ mouth outbreak in <year> when access to farmland was denied
after strong growth in the late <num> traditional flying has shown a slight decline recently reflecting a move amongst recreational flyers towards microlight aircraft and increased numbers of foreign @-@ registered aircraft
recreational helicopter usage has grown primarily due to the introduction of smaller and cheaper aircraft
glider activity has remained relatively static although there has been a gradual increase in the number of self @-@ launching motor gliders
business aviation has shown strong growth although the numbers of aircraft on the uk register have declined
this reflects a shift away from turboprop aircraft towards foreign @-@ registered business jets based in the uk which are estimated to be growing in numbers
however twin piston @-@ engined aircraft numbers have declined significantly reflecting pressures on the light air @-@ taxi segment from increasingly flexible and cheaper scheduled services and a more sophisticated corporate charter business
the amount of flight training conducted by uk schools has declined largely at the hands of competition from foreign schools which benefit from lower costs and better weather
since <year> the total number of hours flown annually by the ga sector has remained in the range <num>
<num> – <num>
<num> million the dominant sector being traditional ga flying which accounts for <num>
<num> million per year
an overall increase in aircraft numbers combined with nil growth in hours flown has brought the annual average utilisation per aircraft down from <num> hours in <year> to <num> hours in <year>
the decline in asset utilisation has led to speculation that the economic health of the ga industry is weakening though the lack of data on profitability makes this difficult to confirm
efforts focus on assuring appropriate standards of airworthiness pilot qualification the rules for the movement of aircraft and equipment to be carried
the caa was established as the primary regulatory body for all aviation in the uk in <year>
in <year> it started working within the joint aviation authorities jaa framework to implement agreed common standards known as the joint aviation requirements jar throughout the european union eu
in <year> this was taken a step further when the european aviation safety agency easa was established as the central eu regulator taking over responsibility for legislating airworthiness and environmental regulation from the national authorities
the caa acts as an agency of easa on these issues retaining its original regulatory powers in areas not yet transferred to easa
proposed developments seek to establish easa as the single authority throughout the eu taking over from individual member states the power to regulate all aviation other than that specifically excluded from the scope of easa
in all cases the caa easa retains responsibility for safety regulation but representative bodies particularly of sectors that are not included in the scope of easa are granted greater oversight of their activities
the majority of microlight aircraft are regulated by the british microlight aircraft association bmaa although a significant number are regulated by the light aircraft association laa formerly known as the popular flying association
the laa is the primary regulator for amateur built aircraft as well as vintage and classic aircraft
parachuting is governed by the british parachute association although the aircraft used in this activity are generally caa @-@ regulated
balloon and airship flying is overseen by the british balloon and airship club
the uk @-@ specific national private pilot licence nppl is administered by the national pilots licensing group ltd
supported by the laa the aircraft owners and pilots association uk the british gliding association and the british microlight aircraft association
separate from these devolved groups gliding in the uk is self @-@ regulated
the british gliding association was until recently responsible for glider airworthiness now formally regulated as a result of easa legislation and still retains control of pilot certification
hang gliding and paragliding activities i
e
foot @-@ launched gliders are governed by the british hang gliding and paragliding association
aircraft that meet these standards are issued with a certificate of airworthiness
however british @-@ registered aircraft which are excluded from the scope of easa and which cannot satisfy the requirements for the issue of a certificate of airworthiness may be issued with a permit to fly
this allows them to fly in uk airspace subject to certain limitations for example being restricted to day @-@ time flights under visual flight rules only
a number of organisations e
g
the british microlight aircraft association and the light aircraft association have obtained a standing over @-@ flight permission for permit to fly aircraft within their area of interest with some european countries notably france
permits are typically issued to vintage and historic aircraft amateur built aircraft and microlights
in addition to the european @-@ wide joint aviation regulations flight crew licensing jar @-@ fcl standard the caa also issues uk @-@ specific national licences
in the absence of european standards for gyroplane balloon and airship pilots the caa licenses these according to the original uk ppl standard
as a response to the perception that jar pilot licensing standards are excessively bureaucratic and expensive for the purposes of recreational pilots the national private pilot licence nppl was introduced in <year>
the nppl is easier to obtain than the jar @-@ fcl licence has less stringent medical requirements is more restrictive in the privileges it grants and is valid only for flights in british @-@ registered aircraft flying in uk and french airspace
although there are plans to bring glider pilot licensing within the regulatory framework of easa the gliding sector is currently self @-@ regulating in this respect
the british gliding association is responsible for defining the standards of initial training and certifying via a badge system pilots who meet those standards
pilots working in sectors of ga that are commercial operations such as aerial work and business aviation are required to hold a professional pilot licence which at a minimum is the commercial pilot licence
the majority of accidents involved small fixed @-@ wing aircraft engaged in private flights and analysis attributes the most common causes of these to flight handling skills poor judgement or airmanship lack of training or experience and omission of or inappropriate action
there were <num> fatal accidents involving ga aircraft in <year> resulting in the loss of <num> lives
these compare with <num> accidents claiming a total of <num> lives the previous year and although the <year> statistics are higher than average they are not exceptional
difficulty with access to larger airports is compounded by a decline in the number of aerodromes generally and existing sites are often threatened with closure and re @-@ development for more profitable uses
the uk planning system is designed to focus on local issues and consideration of the national impact of ga operations is not within its remit
this makes aerodrome development difficult often subjecting those that successfully negotiate the process to restrictions in use
it is divided into controlled airspace in which aircraft must always be under the control of an air traffic controller and uncontrolled airspace in which aircraft can operate autonomously
although ga flights can under certain conditions enter controlled airspace they operate mainly outside of it
controlled airspace is essential for the provision of a known air traffic environment necessary for the safe operation of cat
a caa review found that mixing commercial operations with other users is considered undesirable even untenable by commercial operators
however this position has resulted in extensive class a controlled airspace with complex boundaries including some running down to the ground prohibiting vfr access to airspace resulting in high numbers of ga flights operating close to the borders of controlled airspace who could not get formal receipt of an air traffic service
coupled with pilot navigation errors hundreds of airspace infringements have been recorded every year
increases in the number of cat operations and in the number of airports they operate from has resulted in a corresponding increase in class a controlled airspace
between <year> and <year> this area grew in size from <num> per cent of all airspace to <num> per cent nationally and from <num> per cent to <num> per cent in airspace above england and wales leading to a perception within the ga community of being squeezed out
there are particular problems for ga around large airports where class a controlled airspace extends to ground level
the concentration of commercial operations and high demand for ga in the south east of england have also resulted in extensive areas of class a controlled airspace there which serve to channel uncontrolled ga operations through high @-@ collision @-@ risk hot spots
these operations are commercially and operationally incompatible with ga and although there is no evidence of deliberate discrimination the effect has been to discourage or exclude it
ga aircraft are being subject to significant increases in charges including the imposition of handling fees in some cases
some airports restrict or deny ga parking and others limit or refuse certain ga activity
as a result light ga aircraft are now rarely or never seen at large busy international airports such as heathrow stansted gatwick and manchester
in addition to this de facto loss of facilities the number of aerodromes in the uk has been in decline over the last <num> years as a result of increasing urbanisation and the closure of airfields built during wwii
alternative and more profitable uses for land can also lead to existing aerodromes being threatened with closure for example north weald or actually being closed as happened to ipswich airport
and bristol filton airport
referring to the importance of a functioning national network of ga airfields especially where ga performs an air transport role the caa states that there could be cause for concern if a significant further loss of airfields were to continue especially if crucial nodes on the transport network were to be lost
with many cities lacking scheduled air transport services between them and with ga access to commercial airports becoming increasingly difficult and expensive a viable network of aerodromes supporting ga air transport operations is regarded as an important national issue
however there is no unified national planning policy specific to ga aerodromes and planning decisions relating to these are based on local issues that are not required to consider the national impact
because aircraft are excluded from noise control legislation the only recourse for people affected by aircraft noise is through the planning process and this issue is the principal factor on which the majority of planning decisions relating to ga land use are made
ga is a specialist subject often unfamiliar to local planning authorities and most planning decisions relating to ga either refuse permission or grant it with restrictive conditions
little gransden is just one example of a ga airfield required to comply with planning restrictions on the number of movements permitted thereby inhibiting further development
such restrictions if poorly conceived can make ga operations unviable or even unsafe
in terms of environmental complaints and enquiries made to the caa that relate specifically to ga noise is by far the most common subject
half of the <num> @,@ <num> noise complaints made annually to the caa concern ga operations most of which relate to aerobatics helicopters using private sites air balloon incidents parachute dropping and alleged low flying
planning guidance on aircraft noise advises that in some circumstances the public perceive general aircraft noise levels as more disturbing than similar levels around major airports
this is a result of the tonal characteristics of light aircraft engines and the activities they are engaged in including repetitive circuit flying at low @-@ altitude near an aerodrome during which aircraft are audible for long periods slow climbing aircraft engaged in parachute drop or glider tug activities concentrated around the drop zone or aerodrome also audible for long periods erratic and repetitive engine noise from aircraft engaged in aerobatics and piston @-@ engines on full power in areas of low background noise leading to the perception that such noise is more intrusive
in an attempt to alleviate these problems the majority of aerodromes implement noise abatement procedures designed to route aircraft away from noise sensitive areas and more than <num> are required by the government to provide consultative facilities in which local concerns can be raised with aerodrome operators

nonetheless the presence of the zrínyi and other battleships tied down a substantial force of allied ships
with the war going against the austrians by the end of <year> zrínyi was prepared to be transferred to the new state of slovenes croats and serbs
on <num> november <year> — just one day before the end of the war navy officers sailed the battleship out of pola pula and eventually surrendered to a squadron of american submarine chasers
following the handover to the united states navy she was briefly designated uss zrínyi
in the treaty of saint @-@ germain @-@ en @-@ laye the transfer was not recognized instead zrínyi was given to italy and broken up for scrap
she was laid down on <num> november <year> and launched from the slipway on <num> april <year>
the teak used on zrínyi 's deck was the only material austria @-@ hungary had to purchase abroad to build the ship
the ship was completed by <num> july <year> and on <num> november <year> she was commissioned into the fleet
she was the last ship of the class to be completed and had a crew of <num> to <num> officers and men
zrínyi was <num>
<num> m <num> ft <num> in long and had a beam of <num>
<num> m <num> ft <num> in and a draft of <num>
<num> m <num> ft <num> in
she displaced <num> @,@ <num> long tons <num> @,@ <num> t normally and up to <num> @,@ <num> long tons <num> @,@ <num> t with a full combat load
she was powered by two @-@ shaft four @-@ cylinder vertical triple expansion engines rated at <num> @,@ <num> indicated horsepower
the ship had a top speed of <num>
<num> knots <num>
<num> km h <num>
<num> mph
zrínyi was the first warship in the austro @-@ hungarian navy to use fuel oil to supplement her <num> yarrow @-@ type coal @-@ fired boilers
she had a maximum range of <num> @,@ <num> nautical miles <num> @,@ <num> km <num> @,@ <num> mi at a cruising speed of <num> knots <num> km h <num> mph
the ship 's primary armament consisted of four <num>
<num> cm <num> in <num> @-@ caliber guns in two twin gun turrets
this was augmented by a heavy secondary battery of eight <num> cm <num>
<num> in guns in four wing turrets
the tertiary battery consisted of twenty <num> cm l <num> guns in casemated single mounts four <num> mm <num>
<num> in l <num> and one <num> mm l <num> quick @-@ firing guns
furthermore the ship 's boats were equipped with two <num> mm <num>
<num> in landing guns for operations shore
three <num> cm <num>
<num> in torpedo tubes were also carried one on each broadside and one in the stern
in <year> zrínyi and her two sister ships conducted two training cruises into the eastern mediterranean sea
on the second cruise into the aegean sea conducted from november to december zrínyi and her sister ships were accompanied by the cruiser sms admiral spaun and a pair of destroyers
after returning to pola the entire fleet mobilized for possible hostilities as tensions flared in the balkans
in <year> zrínyi participated in an international naval demonstration in the ionian sea to protest the balkan wars
ships from other navies included in the demonstration were the british pre @-@ dreadnought hms king edward vii the italian pre @-@ dreadnought ammiraglio di saint bon the french armored cruiser edgar quinet and the german light cruiser sms breslau
the most important action of the combined flotilla which was under the command of british admiral cecil burney was to blockade the montenegrin coast
the goal of the blockade was to prevent serbian reinforcements from supporting the siege at scutari where montenegro had besieged a combined force of albanians and ottomans
pressured by the international blockade serbia withdrew its army from scutari which was subsequently occupied by a joint allied ground force
during that year the first of four new dreadnoughts sms viribus unitis that made up the tegetthoff class — the only dreadnoughts built for the austro @-@ hungarian navy — came into active service
with the commissioning of these dreadnoughts zrínyi and her sisters were moved from the 1st division to the <num> division of the 1st battle squadron
along with the remainder of the austro @-@ hungarian navy zrínyi was mobilized in late july <year> to support the flight of sms goeben and sms breslau
the two german ships broke out of messina which was surrounded by the british navy and reached turkey
the flotilla had advanced as far south as brindisi in southeastern italy when news of the successful breakout reached vienna
the austro @-@ hungarian ships were then recalled before seeing action
on <num> may <year> between two and four hours after news of the italian declaration of war reached the main austro @-@ hungarian naval base at pola zrínyi and the rest of the fleet departed to bombard the italian and montenegrin coast
their focus was on the important naval base at ancona and later the coast of montenegro
the bombardment of montenegro was part of the larger austro @-@ hungarian campaign against the kingdoms of montenegro and serbia who were members of the entente during the first half of <year>
the attack on ancona was an immense success and the ships were unopposed during the operation
the bombardment of the province and the surrounding area resulted in the destruction of an italian steamer in the port of ancona itself and an italian destroyer turbine was severely damaged further south
on the shore the infrastructure of the port of ancona as well as the surrounding towns were severely damaged
the railroad yard in ancona as well as the port facilities in the town were damaged or destroyed
the local shore batteries were also suppressed
during the bombardment zrínyi also helped to destroy a train a railway station and a bridge at senigallia
additional targets that were damaged or destroyed included wharves warehouses oil tanks radio stations and the local barracks
sixty @-@ three italians both civilians and military personnel were killed in the bombardment
by the time italian ships from taranto and brindisi arrived on the scene the austro @-@ hungarians were safely back in pola
the objective of the bombardment of ancona was to delay the italian army from deploying its forces along the border with austria @-@ hungary by destroying critical transportation systems
the surprise attack on ancona succeeded in delaying the italian deployment to the alps for two weeks
this delay gave austria @-@ hungary valuable time to strengthen its italian border and re @-@ deploy some of its troops from the eastern and balkan fronts
aside from the attack on ancona the austro @-@ hungarian battleships were largely confined to pola for the duration of the war
their operations were limited by admiral anton haus the commander of the austro @-@ hungarian navy who believed that he would need to husband his ships to counter any italian attempt to seize the dalmatian coast
since coal was diverted to the newer tegetthoff @-@ class battleships the remainder of the war saw zrínyi and the rest of the austro @-@ hungarian navy acting as a fleet in being
this resulted in the allied blockade of the otranto strait
with his fleet blockaded in the adriatic sea and with a shortage of coal haus followed a strategy based on mines and submarines designed to reduce the numerical superiority of the allied navies
however the victorious allies refused to acknowledge the conversations between the austrians and the south slavs and in due course reallocated the ships
the ship had been boarded by a scratch yugoslav crew on <num> november <year> one day before the armistice and had left pola with her sister ship radetzky
they were soon spotted by heavy italian ships so the two battleships hoisted american flags and sailed south along the adriatic coast to castelli bay near spalato also known as split
they appealed for american naval forces to meet them and accept their surrender which a squadron of united states navy usn submarine chasers in the area did
she had apparently been turned over to the fledgling south slav state as it was a croat naval officer korvettenkapitän marijan polić who presented the ship as a prize of war to representatives of the united states navy on the afternoon of <num> november <year> at spalato split in dalmatia
simultaneously she was commissioned as uss zrínyi and lieutenant e
e
hazlett usn assumed command
the initial american complement consisted of four officers and <num> enlisted men — the latter entirely composed of united states navy reserve force personnel
the ship remained at anchor at spalato for nearly a year while the negotiations that would determine her ultimate fate dragged on
only once did she apparently turn her engines over and that occurred during a severe gale that struck spalato on <num> february <year>
on the morning of <num> november <year> zrínyi was decommissioned
uss chattanooga took her in tow and assisted by brooks and hovey towed the battleship to italy
under the terms of the treaties of versailles and st
germain zrínyi was ultimately turned over to the italian government at venice
she was broken up for scrap later that year and into <year>
first described to science in <year> and given its current name in <year> the species is commonly known as the charcoal loving elf @-@ cup dwarf acorn cup stalked bonfire cup or pixie cup
the small goblet @-@ shaped fruitbodies of the fungus are reddish @-@ brown with a whitish fringe and measure up to <num> cm <num>
<num> in across
they have a short tapered stalk
fruitbodies are commonly found on soil where brush has recently been burned sometimes in great numbers
the fungus is distributed throughout many temperate regions of the northern hemisphere
it is found in europe turkey and north america
although it is primarily a saprotrophic species feeding on the decomposing organic matter remaining after a fire it also forms biotrophic associations with the roots of norway spruce
mordecai cubitt cooke illustrated the fruitbodies spores and asci in his <year> work mycographia seu icones fungorum
figures of fungi from all parts of the world
in <year> pier andrea saccardo transferred the fungus to the genus geopyxis giving the species its current name
pustularia carbonaria published by heinrich rehm in <year> is a synonym of g
carbonaria
louis @-@ joseph grélet proposed the variety geopyxis carbonaria var
sessilis in <year> referring to forms producing fruitbodies without a stalk but the taxon is not considered to have independent taxonomic significance
in <year> miles berkeley and moses ashley curtis described the species peziza lepida from collections made in japan as part of the north pacific exploring and surveying expedition <year> – <year>
this taxon was synonymized with g
carbonaria by mien rifai in <year> a taxonomic opinion corroborated by donald pfister about a decade later
the specific epithet carbonaria derives from the latin word for charcoal
common names given to the fungus include charcoal loving elf @-@ cup dwarf acorn cup pixie cup and the british mycological society approved stalked bonfire cup
the inner spore @-@ bearing surface of the cup the hymenium is brick red and smooth while the exterior surface is a dull yellow and may be either smooth or have blister @-@ like spots pustules
the stipe is small <num> – <num>
<num> mm long and <num> – <num> mm wide whitish in color and expands abruptly into the cup
the brownish flesh of the fungus is thin and brittle
it does not have any distinctive taste but has an unpleasant smell when crushed in water
the edibility of the fungus is not known but the fruitbodies are insubstantial and unlikely to be harvested for eating
the spores are elliptical smooth hyaline devoid of oil droplets eguttulate and have dimensions of <num> – <num> by <num> – <num> µm
they are thin walled and germinate and grow rapidly in vitro in the absence of external stimuli
the asci are <num> – <num> by <num> – <num> µm
the paraphyses are slightly club @-@ shaped unbranched and have irregular orange @-@ brown granules with tips up to <num> µm wide and are not forked or lobed
the hypothecium the layer of cells below the hymenium is made of densely packed small irregular cells
it may be distinguished microscopically by its paraphyses which lack the orange @-@ brown granules characteristic of g
carbonaria
it also has larger spores measuring <num> – <num> by <num> – <num> µm
unlike g
carbonaria it grows on substrates other than burned wood including mosses and needle duff
tarzetta cupularis which grows habitats similar to g
carbonaria is distinguished microscopically by its spores that contain two oil droplets
other genera with similar species with which g
carbonaria may be confused in the field include aleuria caloscypha melastiza and sowerbyella
it is one of the most common pioneer species found on burned ground
the charred litter on the forest floor increases the underlying soil ph as well as the availability of minerals
fruitbodies are produced from <num> to <num> weeks after a forest fire in areas with coniferous trees
most fruitbodies are produced in the first year after a burn
the fungus prefers fruiting in microhabitats with thin postfire duff near standing burned tree trunks
geopyxis carbonaria fruitbodies are often found in the same post @-@ fire stands as morels although the former is usually more abundant
because the pixie cup fruits earlier than morels it may serve as an indicator of imminent morel fruiting
other cup fungi often found fruiting in the same area as g
carbonaria include those from the genera aleuria anthracobia peziza and tarzetta
the fungus is found in europe from where it was originally described and is widespread throughout north america
the north american distribution extends north to alaska
in <year> it was reported for the first time from turkey
it had been demonstrated earlier in laboratory experiments that the fungus has a biotrophic interaction with lodgepole pine pinus contorta
the hyphae of g
carbonaria were able to infect the cortex of the tree seedling but did not penetrate the endodermis
these traits suggest that the fungus is a moderate pathogen with limited ability to cause reductions in seed germination
additionally the fungus produces the enzyme polyphenol oxidase and can break down the complex organic polymer lignin — features characteristic of saprotrophic fungi
the formation of a rudimentary hartig net a characteristic of mycorrhizal fungi indicated that g
carbonaria might be capable of forming mutualistic relationships under the right conditions
vrålstad and colleagues suggest that its below @-@ ground association with spruce roots protects it from physical damage in the event of a fire and the extensive fruitbody production after a fire may reflect a successful fungal escape from a dying host where the fungus no longer can maintain its biotrophic association
large fruitings of the fungus are often associated with damage to the host tree such as that which occurs with burning
a field study conducted in norway demonstrated that fruit bodies were more likely to be found in areas that were heavily burned compared to locations with light to moderate burning where the trees remained viable or in clearcut areas
fruiting was much denser in spruce forests — with up to <num> – <num> fruitbodies per square meter — than in pine forests where fruitbodies were sporadic
fruitbodies grew by the millions in the year following the yellowstone fires of <year>
the coin had three types over its lifetime all designed by mint chief engraver james b
longacre
the type <num> issue had the smallest diameter of any united states coin ever minted
a gold dollar had been proposed several times in the <num> and <num> but was not initially adopted
congress was finally galvanized into action by the increased supply of bullion caused by the california gold rush and in <year> authorized a gold dollar
in its early years silver coins were being hoarded or exported and the gold dollar found a ready place in commerce
silver again circulated after congress in <year> required that new coins of that metal be made lighter and the gold dollar became a rarity in commerce even before federal coins vanished from circulation because of the economic disruption caused by the american civil war
gold did not again circulate in most of the nation until <year> once it did the gold dollar did not regain its place
in its final years it was struck in small numbers causing speculation by hoarders
it was also in demand to be mounted in jewelry
the regular issue gold dollar was last struck in <year> the following year congress ended the series
congress followed hamilton 's recommendation only in part authorizing a silver dollar but no coin of that denomination in gold
in <year> the first gold dollar was minted at the private mint of christopher bechtler in north carolina
much of the gold then being produced in the united states came from the mountains of north carolina and georgia and the dollars and other small gold coins issued by bechtler circulated through that region and were now and then seen further away
additional one @-@ dollar pieces were struck by august bechtler christopher 's son
soon after the bechtlers began to strike their private issues secretary of the treasury levi woodbury became an advocate of having the mint of the united states mint when described as an institution strike the one @-@ dollar denomination in gold
he was opposed by the mint director robert m
patterson
woodbury persuaded president andrew jackson to have pattern coins struck
in response patterson had mint second engraver christian gobrecht break off work on the new design for the silver one @-@ dollar coin and work on a pattern for the gold dollar
gobrecht 's design featured a liberty cap surrounded by rays on one side and a palm branch arranged in a circle with the denomination date and name of the country on the other
consideration was given to including the gold dollar as an authorized denomination in the revisionary legislation that became the mint act of <year>
the philadelphia newspaper public ledger in december <year> supported a gold dollar stating that the dollar is the smallest gold coin that would be convenient and as it would be eminently so neither silver nor paper should be allowed to take its place
nevertheless after mint director patterson appeared before a congressional committee the provision authorizing the gold dollar was deleted from the bill
patterson had more of gobrecht 's pattern dollar struck to show to committee members again advising against a coin that if issued would be only about a half inch <num> mm in diameter
he told treasury secretary john c
spencer that the only gold coins of that size in commerce the spanish and colombian half @-@ escudos were unpopular and had not been struck for more than twenty years
this seemed to satisfy the committee as nothing more was done for the time and when a gold dollar was proposed again in <year> mckay 's committee recommended against it
even before <year> record amounts of gold were flowing to american mints to be struck into coin but the california gold rush vastly increased these quantities
this renewed calls for a gold dollar as well as for a higher denomination than the eagle <num> piece then the largest gold coin
in january <year> mckay introduced a bill for a gold dollar which was referred to his committee
there was much discussion in the press about the proposed coin one newspaper published a proposal for an annular gold dollar that is with a hole in the middle to increase its small diameter
mckay amended his legislation to provide for a double eagle <num> gold coin and wrote to patterson who replied stating that the annular gold dollar would not work and neither would another proposal to have dollar piece consisting of a gold plug in a silver coin
nevertheless gobrecht 's successor as chief engraver james b
longacre prepared patterns including some with a square hole in the middle
mckay got his fellow democrat new hampshire senator charles atherton to introduce the bill to authorize the gold dollar and the double eagle in the senate on february <num> <year> — atherton was chairman of the senate finance committee
mckay introduced a version into the house on february <num> debate began the same day
the dollar was attacked by congressmen from the whig party then in the minority on the grounds that it would be too small would be counterfeited and in bad light might be mistakenly spent as a half dime the coins being similar in size
mckay did not respond substantively but stated that if no one wanted these denominations they would not be called for at the mint and would not be coined
pennsylvania representative joseph ingersoll a whig spoke against the bill noting that patterson opposed the new denominations and that the idea had been repeatedly turned down whenever considered
another whig massachusetts 's charles hudson related that patterson had sent a real and a counterfeit gold dollar to his committee and the majority of members had been unable to tell the difference
mckay made no answer to these claims but others did including new york congressman henry nicoll who assured the house that the counterfeiting allegations were greatly exaggerated
the point was he indicated that the double eagle and gold dollar were wanted by the public and in the case of the gold dollar could help money circulate in small communities where banknotes were not accepted
connecticut representative john a
rockwell a whig tried to table the bill but his motion was defeated
the bill passed easily and met only minimal opposition in the senate becoming law on march <num> <year>
the outsider in their midst was chief engraver james b
longacre successor to gobrecht who had died in <year>
a former copper @-@ plate engraver longacre had been appointed through the political influence of south carolina senator john c
calhoun
when longacre began work on the two new coins in early <year> he had no one to assist him
longacre wrote the following year that he had been warned by a mint employee that one of the officers undoubtedly peale planned to undermine the chief engraver 's position by having the work of preparing designs and dies done outside mint premises
accordingly when the gold coin bill became law longacre apprised patterson that he was ready to begin work on the gold dollar
the mint director agreed and after viewing a model of the head on the obverse authorized longacre to proceed with preparation of dies
according to longacre the engraving was unusually minute and required very close and incessant labor for several weeks
i made the original dies and hubs for making the working dies twice over to secure their perfect adaptation to the coining machinery
i had a wish to execute this work single handed that i might thus silently reply to those who had questioned my ability for the work
the result i believe was satisfactory
her hair is gathered in a bun she is surrounded by <num> stars representing the original states
the reverse features the date and denomination within a wreath with the name of the nation near the rim
contemporary reviews of the type <num> design were generally favorable
the new york weekly tribune on may <num> <year> described the new dollar as undoubtedly the neatest tiniest lightest coin in this country
it is too delicate and beautiful to pay out for potatoes and sauerkraut and salt pork
oberon might have paid puck with it for bringing the blossom which bewitched titania
willis bank note list stated that there is no probability of them ever getting into general circulation they are altogether too small
the north carolina standard hoped that they would be struck at the charlotte mint and circulated locally to eliminate the problem of small @-@ denomination bank notes from out of state
coin dealer and numismatic author q
david bowers notes that the head of liberty on the type <num> dollar is a scaled @-@ down version of that on the double eagle and a nicely preserved gold dollar is beautiful to behold
a few coins in proof condition were struck on the first day along with about <num> @,@ <num> for circulation
there are five major varieties of the <year> gold dollar from philadelphia made as longacre continued to fine @-@ tune the design
mintmarked dies were sent by longacre 's engraving department at the philadelphia mint to the branch mints at charlotte dahlonega in georgia and new orleans coins struck at the branches resemble some of the types issued from philadelphia depending on when the dies were produced
of the coins struck at the branch mints in <year> only pieces struck at charlotte <year> @-@ c exist in multiple varieties most are of what is dubbed the closed wreath variety
approximately five of the <year> @-@ c open wreath are known one believed the finest surviving specimen sold at auction for <num> @,@ <num> in <year> remaining a record for the gold dollar series as of <year>
one of the changes made during production was the inclusion of longacre 's initial l on the truncation of liberty 's neck the first time a u
s
coin intended for full @-@ scale production had borne the initial of its designer
all issues beginning in <year> bear the closed wreath
beginning in <year> the gold dollar was also struck at the new san francisco mint
the continued flow of gold from california made silver expensive in terms of gold and u
s
silver coins began to flow out of the country for melting in <year> a flow that accelerated over the next several years as the price of the metal continued to rise
by <year> a thousand dollars in silver coin contained <num> @,@ <num> worth of bullion
as silver coins vanished the gold dollar became the only federal coin in circulation between the cent and the quarter eagle <num>
<num> piece
as such it was struck in large numbers and widely circulated
according to bowers in his book on the denomination the years <year> to <year> were the high @-@ water mark of the gold dollar the glory years of the denomination when the little gold coins took the place of half dollars and silver dollars in everyday transactions
this time came to an end in <year> when congress passed an act reducing the weight of most silver coins allowing new issues of them to circulate
as early as <year> new york congressman william duer alleged that that patterson had made the gold dollar too small in diameter on purpose to provoke criticism
patterson retired that year after <num> years in his position and under his successor george n
eckert annular gold dollar and half dollar patterns were struck
public ledger reported that although gold dollars would not be struck in annular form gold half dollars would be to help fill the need for change
with the new pierce administration thomas m
pettit took office as mint director on march <num> <year>
in april treasury secretary james guthrie wrote to pettit that there were complaints that the gold dollar was too small often lost or mistaken for a small silver coin and enquiring about reports the mint had experimented with annular dollars
pettit replied stating that none had been preserved but enclosed a silver piece of equivalent size
he noted that while there would be technical difficulties in the production of the annular dollar these could be overcome
in a letter dated may <num> pettit proposed an oval @-@ shaped holed piece or an angular @-@ shaped coin which would lessen the production problems
pettit died suddenly on may <num> guthrie did not let the issue fall but queried pettit 's replacement james ross snowden concerning the issue on june <num>
as u
s
coins were required to bear some device emblematic of liberty the secretary hoped that artists could be found who could find some such design for an annular coin
the act of february <num> <year> that had lightened the silver coins also authorized a gold three @-@ dollar piece which began to be produced in <year>
to ensure that the three @-@ dollar piece was not mistaken for other gold coins it had been made thinner and wider than it would normally be and longacre put a distinctive design with an indian princess on it
longacre adapted both the technique and the design for the gold dollar which was made thinner and thus wider
an adaptation of longacre 's princess for the larger gold coin was placed on the dollar and a similar agricultural wreath on the reverse
the idea of making the gold dollar larger in this way had been suggested in congress as early as <year> and had been advocated by pettit but guthrie 's desire for an annular coin stalled the matter
in may <year> snowden sent guthrie a letter stating that the difficulties with an annular coin especially in getting the coins to eject properly from the press were more than trivial
nevertheless the type <num> gold dollar as it came to be known proved unsatisfactory as the mints had difficulty in striking the new coin so that all details were brought out
this was due to the high relief of the design — the three southern branch mints especially had trouble with the piece
many of the type <num> pieces quickly became illegible and were sent back to philadelphia for melting and recoinage
on most surviving specimens the <num> in the date is not fully detailed
the type <num> gold dollar was struck only at philadelphia in <year> and <year> at the three southern branch mints in the latter year and at san francisco in <year> after the design was designated for replacement
to correct the problems longacre enlarged the head of liberty making it a scaled @-@ down version of the three @-@ dollar piece and moved the lettering on the obverse closer to the rim
this improved the metal flow and design sharpness so much that early numismatic scholars assumed the reverse was also altered though in fact no change was made and the type <num> and type <num> reverses are identical
this image is an inexact copy of the design longacre had made for the three @-@ dollar piece and is one of a number of versions of liberty longacre created based on the venus accroupie or crouching venus a sculpture then on display in a philadelphia museum
for the reverse longacre adapted the agricultural wreath he had created for the reverse of the three @-@ dollar piece composed of cotton corn tobacco and wheat blending the produce of north and south
this wreath would appear later in the <num> on the flying eagle cent
art historian cornelius vermeule deprecated the indian princess design used by longacre for the obverses of the types <num> and <num> gold dollar and for the three @-@ dollar piece the princess of the gold coins is a banknote engraver 's elegant version of folk art of the <num>
the plumes or feathers are more like the crest of the prince of wales than anything that saw the western frontiers save perhaps on a music hall beauty
only about <num> @,@ <num> gold dollars were produced in <year> with over two @-@ thirds of that figure at philadelphia just under a third at san francisco and <num> @,@ <num> at dahlonega
roughly a hundred are known of the last creating one of the great rarities from dahlonega in the series
the other candidate for the rarest from that mint is the <year> @-@ d with an estimated mintage of <num> @,@ <num> and perhaps <num> to <num> known
two pairs of dies were shipped from philadelphia to dahlonega on december <num> <year> they arrived on january <num> <year> two weeks before georgia voted to secede from the union as the american civil war began
under orders from governor joseph e
brown state militia secured the mint and at some point small quantities of dollars and half eagles were produced
records of how many coins were struck and when have not survived
since dies crack in time and all the mints were supplied with them from philadelphia coining could not last and in may <year> coins and supplies remaining at dahlonega were turned over to the treasury of the confederate states of america which georgia had by then joined
gold coins with a face value of <num> were put aside for assay
normally they would have been sent to philadelphia to await the following year 's meeting of the united states assay commission when they would be available for testing
instead these were sent to the initial confederate capital of montgomery alabama though what was done with them there and their ultimate fate are unknown
the rarity of the <year> @-@ d dollar and the association with the confederacy make it especially prized
dahlonega like the other two branch mints in the south closed its doors after the <year> strikings
it and the charlotte facility never reopened the new orleans mint again struck coins from <year> to <year> but did not strike gold dollars again
after <year> the only issuance of gold dollars outside philadelphia was at san francisco in <year>
the outbreak of the civil war shook public confidence in the union and citizens began hoarding specie gold and silver coins
in late december <year> banks and then the federal treasury stopped paying out gold at face value
by mid @-@ <year> all federal coins even the base metal cent had vanished from commerce in much of the country
the exception was the far west where for the most part only gold and silver were acceptable currencies and paper money traded at a discount
in the rest of the nation gold and silver coins could be purchased from banks exchange agents and from the treasury for a premium in the new greenbacks the government began to issue to fill the gap in commerce and finance the war
accordingly although <num> @,@ <num> @,@ <num> gold dollars were struck in <year> — the last time production would exceed a million — the mintage fell to <num> @,@ <num> in <year> and remained low for the rest of the coin 's existence excepting <year> and <year>
the mint felt it improper to suspend coinage of a coin authorized by congress and issued proof coins generally a few dozen to the tiny numismatic community from specially @-@ polished dies also producing enough circulation strikes so that the proof coins would not be unduly rare
in <year> and <year> old and worn gold dollars held by the government were melted and recoined generating large mintages of that denomination
this was done in anticipation of the resumption of specie payments which did not occur until the end of <year>
once specie again circulated at face value the gold dollar found no place in commerce amid large quantities of silver coinage either released from hoarding or newly struck by the mint
the government expected that the resumption of specie payments would cause the dollar and other small gold coins to circulate again but the public allowed to redeem paper currency continued to use it as more convenient than coins
in the <num> and <num> public interest grew in the low @-@ mintage gold dollar
collecting coins was becoming more popular and a number of numismatists put aside some gold dollars and hoped for increases in value
the mint most likely channeled its production through some favored philadelphia dealers though proof coins could be purchased for <num>
<num> at the cashier 's window at the philadelphia facility
banks charged a premium for circulation strikes
they were popular in the jewelry trade mounted into various items
the coins were often exported to china or japan where such jewelry was made
the dollars were often damaged in the process the mint refused to sell into this trade and did its best to hinder it
nevertheless mint officials concluded that jewelers were successful at getting the majority of each issue
proof mintages exceeded <num> @,@ <num> by <year> and remained above that mark for the remainder of the series numbers likely inflated by agents of jewelers willing to pay the mint 's premium of
<num> per coin
another use for the gold dollar was as a holiday gift after its abolition the quarter eagle became a popular present
james pollock in his final report as mint director in <year> advocated limiting striking of gold dollars to depositors who specifically requested it
the gold dollar is not a convenient coin on account of its small size and it suffers more proportionately from abrasion than larger coins
his successors called for its abolition with james p
kimball before he left office in <year> writing to congress that except as jewelry little practical use has been found for this coin
later that year the new director edward o
leech issued a report stating that the gold dollar is too small for circulation and
is used almost exclusively for the purposes of ornament
the last year in which the gold dollar was struck was <year>
congress abolished the gold dollar along with the three @-@ cent nickel and three @-@ dollar piece by the act of september <num> <year>
a total of <num> @,@ <num> @,@ <num> gold dollars were coined of which <num> @,@ <num> @,@ <num> were struck at philadelphia <num> @,@ <num> @,@ <num> at new orleans <num> @,@ <num> at charlotte <num> @,@ <num> at san francisco and <num> @,@ <num> at dahlonega
according to an advertisement in the february <year> issue of the numismatist gold dollars brought <num>
<num> each still in demand as a birthday present and for jewelry
that journal in <year> carried news of a customer depositing <num> gold dollars into a bank the teller aware of the value credited the account with <num>
<num> per coin
in <year> a dealer offered <num> each for any quantity
as coin collecting became a widespread pastime in the early <num> century gold dollars became a popular specialty a status they retain

yeoman 's a guide book of united states coins rates the least expensive gold dollar in very fine condition vf @-@ <num> at <num> a value given for each of the type <num> philadelphia issues from <year> to <year>
those seeking one of each type will find the most expensive to be a specimen of the type <num> with the <year> and <year> estimated at <num> in that condition the other two types have dates valued at <num> in that grade
between <year> and <year> nine different issues were produced with a total mintage of <num> @,@ <num>
these were minted for various public events did not circulate and none used longacre 's design
it was discovered in <year> by a
william johnson and developed significantly by e
j
corey and michael chaykovsky
the reaction involves addition of a sulfur ylide to a ketone aldehyde imine or enone to produce the corresponding <num> @-@ membered ring
the reaction is diastereoselective favoring trans substitution in the product regardless of the initial stereochemistry
the synthesis of epoxides via this method serves as an important retrosynthetic alternative to the traditional epoxidation reactions of olefins
the reaction is most often employed for epoxidation via methylene transfer and to this end has been used in several notable total syntheses see synthesis of epoxides below
additionally detailed below are the history mechanism scope and enantioselective variants of the reaction
several reviews have been published
the attempted wittig @-@ like reaction failed and a benzalfluorene oxide was obtained instead noting that reaction between the sulfur ylid and benzaldehydes did not afford benzalfluorenes as had the phosphorus and arsenic ylids
the subsequent development of dimethyloxosulfaniumyl methanide ch3 2soch2 and dimethylsulfaniumyl methanide ch3 2sch2 known as corey – chaykovsky reagents by corey and chaykovsky as efficient methylene @-@ transfer reagents established the reaction as a part of the organic canon
a negative charge is transferred to the heteroatom and because the sulfonium cation is a good leaving group it gets expelled forming the ring
in the related wittig reaction the formation of the much stronger phosphorus @-@ oxygen double bond prevents oxirane formation and instead olefination takes place through a <num> @-@ membered cyclic intermediate
the trans diastereoselectivity observed results from the reversibility of the initial addition allowing equilibration to the favored anti betaine over the syn betaine
initial addition of the ylide results in a betaine with adjacent charges density functional theory calculations have shown that the rate @-@ limiting step is rotation of the central bond into the conformer necessary for backside attack on the sulfonium
the degree of reversibility in the initial step and therefore the diastereoselectivity depends on four factors with greater reversibility corresponding to higher selectivity stability of the substrate with higher stability leading to greater reversibility by favoring the starting material over the betaine
stability of the ylide with higher stability similarly leading to greater reversibility
steric hindrance in the betaine with greater hindrance leading to greater reversibility by disfavoring formation of the intermediate and slowing the rate @-@ limiting rotation of the central bond
solvation of charges in the betaine by counterions such as lithium with greater solvation allowing more facile rotation in the betaine intermediate lowering the amount of reversibility
the reaction has come to encompass reactions of many types of sulfur ylides with electrophiles well beyond the original publications
it has seen use in a number of high @-@ profile total syntheses as detailed below and is generally recognized as a powerful transformative tool in the organic repertoire
the substitution pattern can influence the ease of preparation for the reagents typically from the sulfonium halide e
g
trimethylsulfonium iodide and overall reaction rate in various ways
the general format for the reagent is shown on the right
use of a sulfoxonium allows more facile preparation of the reagent using weaker bases as compared to sulfonium ylides
the difference being that a sulfoxonium contains a doubly bonded oxygen whereas the sulfonium does not
the former react slower due to their increased stability
in addition the dialkylsulfoxide by @-@ products of sulfoxonium reagents are greatly preferred to the significantly more toxic volatile and odorous dialkylsulfide by @-@ products from sulfonium reagents
the vast majority of reagents are monosubstituted at the ylide carbon either r1 or r2 as hydrogen
disubstituted reagents are much rarer but have been described if the ylide carbon is substituted with an electron @-@ withdrawing group ewg the reagent is referred to as a stabilized ylide
these similarly to sulfoxonium reagents react much slower and are typically easier to prepare
these are limited in their usefulness as the reaction can become prohibitively sluggish examples involving amides are widespread with many fewer involving esters and virtually no examples involving other ewg 's
for these the related darzens reaction is typically more appropriate
if the ylide carbon is substituted with an aryl or allyl group the reagent is referred to as a semi @-@ stabilized ylide
the substitution pattern on aryl reagents can heavily influence the selectivity of the reaction as per the criteria above
if the ylide carbon is substituted with an alkyl group the reagent is referred to as an unstabilized ylide
the size of the alkyl groups are the major factors in selectivity with these reagents
the r @-@ groups on the sulfur though typically methyls have been used to synthesize reagents that can perform enantioselective variants of the reaction see variations below
the size of the groups can also influence diastereoselectivity in alicyclic substrates
examples involving complex substrates and exotic ylides have been reported as shown below
the reaction has been used in a number of notable total syntheses including the danishefsky taxol total synthesis which produces the chemotherapeutic drug taxol and the kuehne strychnine total synthesis which produces the pesticide strychnine
though less widely applied the reaction has a similar substrate scope and functional group tolerance to the carbonyl equivalent
the examples shown below are representative in the latter an aziridine forms in situ and is opened via nucleophilic attack to form the corresponding amine
many electron @-@ withdrawing groups have been shown compatible with the reaction including ketones esters and amides the example below involves a weinreb amide
with further conjugated systems <num> @,@ <num> @-@ addition tends to predominate over <num> @,@ <num> @-@ addition
with epoxides and aziridines the reaction serves as a ring @-@ expansion to produce the corresponding oxetane or azetidine
the long reaction times required for these reactions prevent them from occurring as significant side reactions when synthesizing epoxides and aziridines
several cycloadditions wherein the ylide serves as a nucleophilic carbenoid equivalent have been reported
living polymerizations using trialkylboranes as the catalyst and dimethyloxosulfaniumyl methanide as the monomer have been reported for the synthesis of various complex polymers
e
yielding an enantiomeric excess which is labelled as ee variant of the johnson – corey – chaykovsky reaction remains an active area of academic research
the use of chiral sulfides in a stoichiometric fashion has proved more successful than the corresponding catalytic variants but the substrate scope is still limited in all cases
the catalytic variants have been developed almost exclusively for enantioselective purposes typical organosulfide reagents are not prohibitively expensive and the racemic reactions can be carried out with equimolar amounts of ylide without raising costs significantly
chiral sulfides on the other hand are more costly to prepare spurring the advancement of catalytic enantioselective methods
the first is a bicyclic oxathiane that has been employed in the synthesis of the β @-@ adrenergic compound dichloroisoproterenol dci but is limited by the availability of only one enantiomer of the reagent
the synthesis of the axial diastereomer is rationalized via the <num> @,@ <num> @-@ anomeric effect which reduces the nucleophilicity of the equatorial lone pair
the conformation of the ylide is limited by transannular strain and approach of the aldehyde is limited to one face of the ylide by steric interactions with the methyl substituents
the other major reagent is a camphor @-@ derived reagent developed by varinder aggarwal of the university of bristol
both enantiomers are easily synthesized although the yields are lower than for the oxathiane reagent
the ylide conformation is determined by interaction with the bridgehead hydrogens and approach of the aldehyde is blocked by the camphor moiety
the reaction employs a phosphazene base to promote formation of the ylide
there are also issues with substrate scope most having limitations with methylene transfer and aliphatic aldehydes
the trouble stems from the need for a nucleophilic sulfide that efficiently generates the ylide which can also act as a good leaving group to form the epoxide
since the factors underlying these desiderata are at odds tuning of the catalyst properties has proven difficult
shown below are several of the most successful catalysts along with the yields and enantiomeric excess for their use in synthesis of e -stilbene oxide
aggarwal has developed an alternative method employing the same sulfide as above and a novel alkylation involving a rhodium carbenoid formed in situ
the method too has limited substrate scope failing for any electrophiles possessing basic substituents due to competitive consumption of the carbenoid
the treaty put an end to the fighting between forces supporting madero and those of díaz and thus concluded the initial phase of the mexican revolution
the treaty stipulated that díaz as well as his vice president ramón corral were to step down by the end of may and that he was to be replaced by francisco león de la barra as interim president and hold presidential elections
those who had suffered losses due to the revolution would be the indemnified and there would be a general amnesty
díaz resigned on may <num> and interim president francisco león de la barra was the new incumbent
díaz and his family his vice president corral plus josé yves limantour and rosendo pineda left mexico for exile
significantly the treaty did not mention or institute any social reforms that madero had vaguely promised on previous occasions
it also left the porfirian state essentially intact
additionally madero supported the unpopular idea that all land disputes were to be settled through the courts staffed by the old judges a decision that led to outbreaks of sporadic violence particularly in rural areas
on june <num> <year> madero entered mexico city
in october <year> he was elected president under the banner of the partido constitucional progresista along with josé maría pino suárez his new running mate as vice @-@ president
madero pushed aside francisco vázquez gómez the vice presidential candidate for the anti @-@ reelectionist party in <year> as being too moderate
madero 's earlier vague promises of agrarian reforms had attracted many supporters
he himself escaped from prison and fled to texas from where he issued his famous plan of san luis potosí
this manifesto called for an armed uprising against the porfiriato and establishment of free and democratic elections
as a response to madero 's proclamation violent clashes began throughout mexico in november <year>
in the guerrero district of chihuahua pascual orozco attacked federal troops and sent dead soldiers clothing back to díaz with the message ahí te van las hojas mándame más tamales here are the wrappers send me more tamales
he then began operations which threatened ciudad juárez
additionally political support for madero 's rebellion came from abraham gonzález who accepted the plan of san luis potosí
at roughly the same time agrarian unrest in the state of morelos turned into a full blown rebellion under the leadership of the zapata brothers emiliano and eufemio
he was joined by pancho villa and orozco and in april the army began approaching ciudad juárez
orozco and villa led the way with <num> men each while madero followed up with <num> @,@ <num> riders
the city was besieged by the end of the month after madero 's army encountered some resistance in the chihuahuan countryside
madero asked the commander of the city 's garrison to surrender but the latter refused hoping that the fortifications he had constructed would allow him to defend the city until reinforcements arrived
concerned also with the possibility that a direct attack on the town would cause artillery shells to cross the border into the united states which could provoke an outside intervention and faced with a series of peace proposals from díaz madero hesitated in attacking the city
he in fact ordered his commanders to lift the siege
orozco however disregarded the order and joined by villa attacked
after two days of fighting the city fell to the insurrectionists
madero intervened personally to spare the life of the city 's commander gen
navarro whom both orozco and villa wanted executed for his previous killing of rebel pows
this coupled with the fact that both leaders were ignored by madero in his political appointments outraged and estranged them from him
on april <num> madero had emiliano zapata officially designated as his representative in the region
however zapata was worried that if he did not fully control all the major towns in morelos by the time that madero concluded negotiations with díaz the demands of his agrarian movement and the issue of the autonomy of morelos would be ignored or sidelined
zapata 's first military action was to take the town of chinameca where he obtained essential supplies
subsequently zapata for political and strategic reasons decided to attack the city of cuautla
in order to mislead his opponents however he initially attacked and captured the towns of izúcar de matamoros which was subsequently retaken by federal forces and chietla
from there he made a wide circle around cuautla and captured yautepec and jonacatepec where he gathered more supplies munitions and soldiers
by may out of all the major urban centers in the region only cuautla and the capital of morelos cuernavaca remained outside of his control
zapata began the attack on cuautla on may <num> with <num> troops against <num> elite soldiers of the so @-@ called golden fifth the fifth cavalry regiment of the federal army
the battle took almost a week and has been described as six of the most terrible days of battle in the whole revolution
it consisted of house to house fighting hand @-@ to @-@ hand combat and no quarter given by either side
general victoriano huerta arrived in nearby cuernavaca with <num> reinforcements but decided not to come to the relief of cuautla as he was afraid that the capital would revolt in his absence
on may <num> the remains of the golden fifth pulled out of the town which was then occupied by zapata 's soldiers
the successful capture of cuautla made zapata a hero to ordinary people throughout mexico and new corridos were written about him
after zapata 's taking of cuautla the federal government controlled only five states and some urban areas
porfirio díaz himself later stated that while he felt that he could defend against villa and orozco in chihuahua the fall of cuautla was the event which persuaded him to agree to peace with madero
limantour proposed an end to the hostilities and offered an amnesty for all revolutionaries the resignation of the then vice president ramón corral the replacement of four díaz cabinet ministers and ten state governors by ones chosen by madero and the establishment of the principle of no @-@ reelection which would prevent díaz from seeking yet another term as president which would have been his ninth
madero responded positively although he also stated that any kind of peace deal had to include an immediate resignation by díaz
faced with the siege of ciudad juárez and the outbreak of rebellion in morelos díaz and members of his cabinet became more willing to negotiate and launched a skillful peace offensive aimed at madero
this was largely a result of panic among the large landowners associated with the díaz regime the hacendados and the financial elite which represented a moderate wing within the government
some among the porfiristas in fact expected that zapata would soon march on mexico city itself unless peace was concluded with madero
the moderate view within the díaz government was represented by jorge vera estañol who in a memo to the minister of foreign affairs wrote that there were two revolutions taking place in mexico a political revolution based mostly in the north whose aim was mostly to establish free elections and remove díaz himself from power and a social revolution whose aim was anarchy which was spreading throughout the mexican countryside
estañol recommended coming to terms with the first group of revolutionaries by agreeing to the principle of no re @-@ election and a general amnesty in order to prevent the second group from succeeding
in addition to his fear of anarchy estañol was also worried that the social revolution would lead to a military intervention by the united states
estañol 's views represented those of the portion of the upper class which was willing to come to terms with at least a portion of the middle class in order to crush the peasant uprisings as exemplified by those of zapata which were erupting throughout mexico
limantour who broadly agreed with estañol had the support of the mexican financiers who feared the downgrading of mexican international credit and a general economic crisis as a result of ongoing social unrest as well as that of the large landowners who were willing to come to terms with madero if it would put an end to the agrarian uprisings
these social group were in turn opposed by the more reactionary elements within díaz 's government mostly concentrated in the federal army who though that the rebels should be dealt with through brute force
this faction was represented by general victoriano huerta who would later carry out an attempted coup d 'état against madero
likewise the general and potential successor to díaz bernardo reyes stated in a letter to limantour that the repression against the insurrectionists should be carried out with the greates energy punishing without any pity anyone participating in the armed struggle
in the end however díaz dismissed the advice from his generals as custer @-@ like bluster and chose to seek peace with the moderate wing of the revolution
limantour had finally managed to persuade him to resign
at the same time there was also disagreement among the rebels
the left wing of the revolutionary movement represented by zapata and orozco villa for the time being tended to support madero warned against any possible compromises with díaz
in the end their suspicions proved correct as the treaty that was eventually signed neglected issues of social and agrarian land reform that were central to their struggle
additionally the treaty stipulated that an amnesty for all revolutionaries be declared with the option for some of them to apply for membership in the rurales
the revolutionary forces were to be demobilized as soon as possible and the federal forces were to be the only army in mexico
this was in order to appease the army which had opposed a compromise with madero
madero and his supporters had the right to name fourteen provisional state governors and to approve la barra 's cabinet
pensions were to be established for relatives of the soldiers who had died fighting the rebels
policemen and judges as well as state legislators that had been appointed or elected under díaz were to retain their offices
díaz resigned accordingly on may <num>
francisco de la barra became the interim president
madero entered mexico city on june <num>
zapata however refused to recognize the interim government of de la barra and for the time being the fighting in morelos continued
madero met with zapata on several occasions during june
while initially zapata trusted madero with time he became increasingly concerned that the goals of his revolution were not being fulfilled
he was particularly angry that madero did not plan on carrying out any kind of agrarian reform or the breakup of large hacendias
additionally the press in mexico city controlled by the landowners began referring to zapata as a bandit and federal generals such as huerta continued attacking his troops under the pretext that zapata failed to demobilize in violation of the treaty
sporadic fighting in southern mexico continued
in november <year> shortly after madero 's inauguration zapata issued the famous plan of ayala in which the zapatistas denounced madero and instead recognized pascual orozco as the rightful president and leader of the revolution
madero also earned the great displeasure of other revolutionaries including pascual orozco
madero 's first act after the treaty was signed was a gesture of reconciliation with the díaz regime
as a result of the treaty he was given the right to appoint members of the la barra cabinet
he chose mostly upper class maderistas including his wife for the post in the treasury
he also maintained the existing federal system by keeping the sitting judges of the supreme court the legislators in federal and state assemblies and the bureaucrats of the various federal agencies
venustiano carranza who was going to become a major revolutionary in his own right and a future president of mexico stated that after the treaty madero had deliver ed to the reactionaries a dead revolution which will have to be fought over again
díaz after leaving for exile in france observed that madero has unleashed a tiger let us see if he can control him
orozco who saw himself as being instrumental in madero 's victory over díaz was merely appointed as a commander of the rurales in chihuahua which increased his resentment
when he tried to run for governor of the state madero supported his opponent abraham gonzález and eventually pressured orozco to drop out of the race
when in the aftermath of the plan of ayala madero ordered orozco to lead federal troops to suppress zapata orozco refused
in march <year> orozco issued his plan of empacadora and formally declared himself in rebellion against madero
the book is set in the dominican republic and portrays the assassination of dominican dictator rafael trujillo and its aftermath from two distinct standpoints a generation apart during and immediately after the assassination itself in may <year> and thirty five years later in <year>
throughout there is also extensive reflection on the heyday of the dictatorship in the <num> and its significance for the island and its inhabitants
the novel follows three interwoven storylines
the first concerns a woman urania cabral who is back in the dominican republic after a long absence to visit her ailing father she ends up recalling incidents from her youth and recounting a long @-@ held secret to her aunt and cousins
the second story line focuses on the last day in trujillo 's life from the moment he wakes up onwards and shows us the regime 's inner circle to which urania 's father once belonged
the third strand depicts trujillo 's assassins many of whom had previously been government loyalists as they wait for his car late that night after the assassination this story line shows us the assassins persecution
each aspect of the book 's plot reveals a different viewpoint on the dominican republic 's political and social environment past and present
readers are shown the regime 's downward spiral trujillo 's assassination and its aftermath through the eyes of insiders conspirators and a middle @-@ aged woman looking back
the novel is therefore a kaleidoscopic portrait of dictatorial power including its psychological effects and its long @-@ term impact
the novel 's themes include the nature of power and corruption and their relationship to machismo and sexual perversion in a rigidly hierarchical society with strongly gendered roles
memory and the process of remembering is also an important theme especially in urania 's narrative as she recalls her youth in the dominican republic
her story and the book as a whole ends when she recounts the terrible events that led to her leaving the country at the age of <num>
the book itself serves as a reminder of the atrocities of dictatorship to ensure that the dangers of absolute power will be remembered by a new generation
vargas llosa interlaces fictional elements and historical events the book is not a documentary and the cabral family for instance is completely fictional
on the other hand the characters of trujillo and trujillo 's assassins are drawn from the historical record vargas llosa weaves real historical incidents of brutality and oppression into these people 's stories to further illuminate the nature of the regime and the responses it provoked
in vargas llosa 's words it 's a novel not a history book so i took many many liberties

i have respected the basic facts but i have changed and deformed many things in order to make the story more persuasive — and i have not exaggerated
the feast of the goat received largely positive reviews with several reviewers commenting on the book 's depiction of the relationship between sexuality and power and on the graphic descriptions of violent events
a film version of the novel was released in <year> starring isabella rossellini paul freeman and tomas milian
jorge alí triana and his daughter veronica triana wrote a theatrical adaptation in <year>
it is also unusual because it is the first to have a female protagonist as critic lynn walford writes of the leading character in the feast of the goat and also vargas llosa 's subsequent book the way to paradise both are utterly unlike any of the other female characters in his previous novels
the novel examines the dictatorial regime of rafael leónidas trujillo molina in the dominican republic
trujillo was in historian eric roorda 's words a towering influence in dominican and caribbean history who presided over one of the most durable regimes of the twentieth century during the thirty @-@ one years between his seizure of power in <year> and his assassination in <year>
trujillo had trained with the united states marine corps during the united states occupation of the island and graduated from the haina military academy in <year>
after the u
s
departed in <year> he became head of the dominican national police which under his command was transformed into the dominican national army and trujillo 's personal virtually autonomous power base
trujillo was officially dictator only from <year> to <year> and from <year> to <year> but remained in effective power throughout the entire period
though his regime was broadly nationalist daniel chirot comments that he had no particular ideology and that his economic and social policies were basically progressive
the novel 's title is taken from the popular dominican merengue mataron al chivo they killed the goat which refers to trujillo 's assassination on may <num> <year>
merengue is a style of music created by ñico lora in the <num> and actively promoted by trujillo himself it is now considered the country 's national music
cultural critics julie sellers and stephen ropp comment about this particular merengue that by envisaging the dictator as an animal who could be turned into a stew as frequently happened with goats struck down on the dominican republic 's highways the song gave those performing listening to and dancing to this merengue a sense of control over him and over themselves that they had not experienced for over three decades
vargas llosa quotes the lyrics to mataron al chivo at the beginning of the novel
one is centred on urania cabral a fictional dominican character another deals with the conspirators involved in trujillo 's assassination and the third focuses on trujillo himself
the novel alternates between these storylines and also jumps back and forth from <year> to <year> with frequent flashbacks to periods earlier in trujillo 's regime
the feast of the goat begins with the return of urania to her hometown of santo domingo a city which had been renamed ciudad trujillo during trujillo 's time in power
this storyline is largely introspective and deals with urania 's memories and her inner turmoil over the events preceding her departure from the dominican republic thirty @-@ five years earlier
urania escaped the crumbling trujillo regime in <year> by claiming she planned to study under the tutelage of nuns in michigan
in the following decades she becomes a prominent and successful new york lawyer
she finally returns to the dominican republic in <year> on a whim and finds herself compelled to confront her father and elements of her past she has long ignored
as urania speaks to her ailing father agustin cabral she recalls more and more of the anger and disgust that led to her thirty @-@ five years of silence
urania retells her father 's descent into political disgrace and the betrayal that forms the crux of both urania 's storyline and that of trujillo himself
the second and third storylines are set in <year> in the weeks prior to and following trujillo 's assassination on <num> may
each assassin has his own background story explaining his motivation for his involvement in the assassination plot
each has been wronged by trujillo and his regime by torture and brutality or through assaults on their pride their religious faith their morality or their loved ones
vargas llosa weaves the tale of the men as memories recalled on the night of trujillo 's death as the conspirators lie in wait for the goat
interconnected with these stories are the actions of other famous trujillistas of the time joaquín balaguer the puppet president johnny abbes garcía the merciless head of the military intelligence service sim and various others — some real some composites of historical figures and some purely fictional
the third storyline is concerned with the thoughts and motives of rafael leónidas trujillo molina himself
the chapters concerning the goat recall the major events of his time including the slaughter of thousands of dominican haitians in <year>
they also deal with the dominican republic 's tense international relationships during the cold war especially with the united states under the presidency of john f
kennedy and cuba under castro
vargas llosa also speculates upon trujillo 's innermost thoughts and paints a picture of a man whose physical body is failing him
trujillo is tormented by incontinence and impotence and this storyline intersects with urania 's narrative when it is revealed that urania was sexually assaulted by trujillo
he is unable to achieve an erection with urania and in frustration and anger he rapes her with his hands
this event is the core of urania 's shame and her hatred towards her father
in addition it is the cause of trujillo 's repeated anger over the anemic little bitch that witnessed his impotence and emotion and the reason he is en route to sleep with another girl on the night of his assassination
in the novel 's final chapters the three storylines intersect with increasing frequency
the tone of these chapters is especially dark as they deal primarily with the horrific torture and death of the assassins at the hands of the sim the failure of the coup the rape of urania and the concessions made to trujillo 's most vicious supporters allowing them to enact their horrific revenge on the conspirators and then escape the country
the book ends as urania prepares to return home determined this time to keep in touch with her family back on the island
in the year <year> urania returns to the dominican republic for the first time since her departure at the age of <num>
she is a successful new york lawyer who has spent most of the past <num> years trying to overcome the traumas of her childhood a goal she pursues through an academic fascination with trujillo and dominican history
urania is deeply troubled by the events of her past and is compelled to confront her father agustín about his role in those events
urania visits her father finding him weakened by age and a severe stroke so much so that he is barely able to respond physically to her presence let alone speak
agustín listens helplessly as urania recounts his past as egghead cabral a high @-@ ranking member of trujillo 's inner circle and his drastic fall from grace
urania details agustín 's role in the events that led to her rape by the dominican leader and to her subsequent lifetime of celibacy and emotional trauma
agustín 's character in the modern day portion of the novel serves primarily as a sounding board for urania 's recollections of the trujillo era and the events that surrounded both agustín cabral 's disgrace and urania 's escape from the country
his responses are minimal and non @-@ vocal despite the ardency of urania 's accusations and the enormity of his own actions during trujillo 's reign
in the feast of the goat vargas llosa imagines the innermost thoughts of the dictator and retells the goat 's last hours from his own perspective
trujillo 's character struggles with aging and the physical problems of incontinence and impotence
through fictional events and first person narrative the reader is given insight into the man who during his thirty @-@ one years of horrendous political crimes modernized the country 's infrastructure and military but whose regime 's attacks against its enemies overseas particularly the attempted assassination of rómulo betancourt president of venezuela led to the imposition of economic sanctions on the dominican republic by the organization of american states in the <num>
the resultant economic downturn in conjunction with other factors leads to the cia supported assassination plot that ends trujillo 's life on may <num> <year>
trujillo 's regime is supported by johnny abbes garcía the head of the military intelligence service sim a brutal man to whom many disappearances
executions
sudden falls into disgrace are attributed
abbes and his intelligence officers are notorious for their cruelty particularly their habit of killing dissidents by throwing them into shark @-@ infested waters
colonel abbes may be the devil but he 's useful to the chief everything bad is attributed to him and only the good to trujillo
trujillo 's son ramfis trujillo is a loyal supporter of the chief
after unsuccessful attempts at schooling in the united states ramfis returns to the dominican republic to serve in his father 's military
he is a well @-@ known womanizer
upon trujillo 's death ramfis seeks revenge even going so far as to torture and kill his uncle by marriage general jose roman for his part in the assassination conspiracy
joaquín balaguer trujillo 's puppet president is also a supporter and initially his seemingly innocuous character holds no real power
following trujillo 's death the calm and serenity of balaguer bring about real change in his character and general román comments that this insignificant man whom everyone had always considered a mere clerk a purely decorative figure in the regime began to acquire surprising authority
it is balaguer who guides much of the action in the last sections of the book
antonio imbert barrera is one of the few conspirators who survives the violent reprisals that follow trujillo 's assassination
imbert is a politician who becomes disillusioned with the deception and cruelty of the trujillo regime
his first plan to kill trujillo was foiled by the unsuccessful attempted overthrow of the regime by cuban paramilitary forces
now convinced of the difficulty of his task imbert joins the other conspirators in plotting trujillo 's death
among the others is antonio de la maza one of trujillo 's personal guards
antonio 's brother is killed as part of a government cover @-@ up and antonio swears revenge upon trujillo
salvador estrella sadhalá known as turk is a devout catholic who in indignation at the regime 's many crimes against god swears an oath against trujillo
turk eventually turns himself in for fear that the regime was torturing his family
both turk and his innocent brother are then tortured for months
his father remains loyal to trujillo and disowns turk to his face
despite all of this turk refuses to commit suicide and does not lose faith in god
he is later executed by ramfis and other high level government men
turk 's close friend amado garcía guerrero known as amadito is a lieutenant in the army who gave up his beloved as proof of his loyalty to trujillo and then later was forced to kill her brother to prove himself to trujillo
amadito 's disgust with himself and disillusionment with the regime lead to his decision to help to kill trujillo
following the assassination he hides out with de la maza and dies fighting
in the aftermath of the assassination amadito and antonio de la maza choose to fight the members of sim who come to arrest them opting to die in battle rather than be captured and tortured
olga lorenzo reviewer for the melbourne age suggests that overall vargas llosa 's aim is to reveal the irrational forces of latin tradition that give rise to despotism
rafael trujillo the ruler was a cruel dictator who haunts the people of santo domingo even <num> years after his death
he is a true caudillo ruling with brutality and corruption
he creates a personality cult in his capitalist society and encourages decadence within his regime
prior to promotion to a position of responsibility an officer is required to pass a test of loyalty
his people are to remain loyal to him all cost and are periodically tested by public humiliation and censure even though acts of disloyalty were rare
trujillo violates women and children as an expression of political and sexual power and in some cases takes the wife or child of his lieutenants many of whom still remain blindly loyal
even the church and military institutions are employed to give women to the tyrant for pleasure
many of the assassins had belonged to the trujillo regime or had at one point been its staunch supporters only to find their support for him eroded by the state 's crimes against its people
imbert one of the assassins sums up this realization in a comment prompted by the murder of the mirabal sisters they kill our fathers our brothers our friends
and now they 're killing our women
and here we sit resigned waiting our turn
in an interview vargas llosa describes the corruption and brutality of trujillo 's regime he had more or less all the common traits of a latin american dictator but pushed to the extreme
in cruelty i think he went far far away from the rest — and in corruption too
aggressive behaviour is exhibited by displays of power and strength while hyper @-@ sexuality is revealed through sexual activity with as many partners as possible
these two components shape the portrayal of trujillo and his regime in the feast of the goat
as lorenzo observes vargas llosa reveals traditions of machismo of abusive fathers and of child @-@ rearing practices that repeat the shaming of children so that each generation bequeaths a withering of the soul to the subsequent one
in a display of both aspects of machismo trujillo demanded of his aides and cabinet that they provide him with sexual access to their wives and daughters
mario vargas llosa wrote of trujillo 's machismo and treatment of women h e went to bed with his ministers wives not only because he liked these ladies but because it was a way to test his ministers
he wanted to know if they were ready to accept this extreme humiliation
mainly the ministers were prepared to play this grotesque role — and they remained loyal to trujillo even after his death
trujillo 's sexual conquests and public humiliations of his enemies also serve to affirm his political power and machismo
in niessa 's words the implication is that maximum virility equals political dominance
trujillo 's attempted sexual conquest of urania is an example of both political manipulation of agustín cabral and sexual power over young women
however as trujillo 's penis remains flaccid throughout the encounter and he is humiliated in front of the young girl the encounter fails to satisfy his requirements for machismo
the most apparent confrontation of memory is on the part of urania cabral who has returned to the dominican republic for the first time in <num> years and is forced to confront her father and the traumas that led her to leave the country at <num>
she was the victim of sexual abuse at the hands of the dictator himself a sacrifice her father made to try to gain favor with the dictator again a fact to which she alludes throughout the book but which is only revealed at the very end the book concludes with her recounting the memory of that night to her aunt and cousins who never knew the true reason she left the country
when her aunt is surprised that she remembers all these details she responds that while she forgets many things i remember everything about that night
for urania forgetting the atrocities committed by the regime is unacceptable
her father on the other hand is not capable of joining her in this process of remembering since he has suffered a stroke and is not capable of speaking however urania is angry that he chose to forget these things while he was still capable of acknowledging them
memory is also important in the sections of the novel that deal with the assassins
each recalls the events that led him to take part in the assassination of trujillo
these incidents included the <year> galindez kidnapping and murder the <year> murder of the mirabal sisters and the <year> split with the catholic church
these historical events are used by vargas llosa to connect the assassins with specific moments that demonstrate the violence of trujillo 's regime
trujillo too is shown reflecting on the past not least his own formation and training at the hands of the us marines
but above all mario vargas llosa uses the fictional urania to facilitate the novel 's attempt at remembering the regime
the novel opens and closes with urania 's story effectively framing the narrative in the terms of remembering the past and understanding its legacy in the present
in addition because of her academic study of the history of the trujillo regime urania is also confronting the memory of the regime for the country as a whole
this is in keeping with one purpose of the book which is to ensure that the atrocities of the dictatorship and the dangers of absolute power will be remembered by a new generation
the government 's actions in the feast of the goat demonstrate the discourse of prohibition foreign newspapers and magazines were prohibited from entering trujillo 's country as they were seen as a threat to the government 's ideas
mario vargas llosa takes part in this discourse by recounting what was prohibited
ruiz notes that writing also has the power to transform reality
it brings the reader back to the past allowing the reader to comprehend myths or distorted stories told by historians
ruiz contends that knowing the past is crucial to one 's understanding of the present that takes us to postmodernism and argues that the feast of the goat can thus be seen as a postmodern discourse that gives power to history recreation
the construction of fictions surrounding the events of trujillo 's regime allow a degree of freedom from the horrors that took places
author julia alvarez contends that these events can only finally be understood by fiction only finally be redeemed by the imagination while richard patterson claims that vargas llosa reconfigures and to a large degree demythologizes trujillo and his brutal reign through use of narrative structure
vargas llosa 's writing acts as a cathartic force for this period in history
blending together these two elements is important in any historical novel but especially in the feast of the goat because vargas llosa chose to narrate an actual event through the minds of both real and fictional characters
some characters are fictional and those that are non @-@ fictional still have fictionalized aspects in the book
the general details of the assassination are true and the assassins are all real people
while they lie in wait for the dictator to arrive they recount actual crimes of the regime such as the murder of the mirabal sisters
however other details are invented by vargas llosa such as amadito 's murder of the brother of the woman he loved
those within the regime are also a mix of fictional characters and real people
president balaguer is real but the entire cabral family is completely fictional
according to wolff vargas llosa uses history as a starting point in constructing a fictionalized account of trujillo 's spiritual colonization of the dominican republic as experienced by one dominican family
the fictional cabral family allows vargas llosa to show two sides of the trujillo regime through agustin the reader sees ultimate dedication and sacrifice to the leader of the nation through urania the violence of the regime and the legacy of pain it left behind
vargas llosa also fictionalized the internal thoughts of the characters who were non @-@ fictional especially those of the goat himself
according to literary scholar richard patterson vargas llosa 's expands all the way into the very dark area of trujillo 's consciousness as the storyteller dares to conceive it
vargas llosa also built an image of the regime with the troubled historical events
with regard to the historical accuracy of the book vargas llosa has said it 's a novel not a history book so i took many many liberties
the only limitation i imposed on myself was that i was not going to invent anything that couldn 't have happened within the framework of life in the dominican republic
i have respected the basic facts but i have changed and deformed many things in order to make the story more persuasive — and i have not exaggerated
the novel received largely positive reviews most of which were willing to accept sacrifices of historical accuracy in favour of good storytelling
a common comment on the novel is the graphic nature of the many acts of torture and murder which are depicted in the novel
vargas lets the reader see the realities of an oppressive regime with a degree of detail not often used by his compatriots in latin american literature as michael wood suggests in the london review of books vargas llosa
tells us far more about the details of day @-@ to @-@ day intrigue and the sordid sadistic minutiae of torture and murder
walter kirn of the new york times suggests that the grisly scenes of dungeon interrogations and torture sessions cast other aspects of the novel in a pale light draining them of their significance and impact
similarly kirn implies that the narrative machinery mentioned by wood as being somewhat unwieldy also produces a largely superfluous storyline
the plot line centered on urania cabral is described by sturrock as being an emotional centre that focuses the novel and wood agrees that her confrontations with past demons hold the readers attention
in contrast kirn 's review states that urania 's segments are talky and atmospheric
and seem to be on loan from another sort of book
most reviews of the feast of the goat make either indirect of direct reference to the relationship between sexuality and power
salon reviewer laura miller writer for the observer jonathan heawood walter kirn and michael wood each detail the connection between trujillo 's gradual loss of ultimate control both over his body and his followers
the means by which trujillo reinforces political power through sexual acts and begins to lose personal conviction as his body fails him are topics of frequent discussion among reviewers
in <year> bernard diederich author of the <year> non @-@ fiction book trujillo
the death of the goat accused vargas @-@ llosa of plagiarism
it stars isabella rossellini as urania cabral paul freeman as her father agustin stephanie leonidas as uranita and tomas milian as rafael leonidas trujillo
it was filmed in both the dominican republic and in spain
reviewing the film for the trade paper variety critic jonathan holland called it less a feast than a somewhat rushed but thoroughly enjoyable three @-@ course meal commenting that the main difference from the source novel was the sacrifice of psychological nuance
the novel has also been adapted for the stage by jorge alí triana and his daughter veronica triana directed by jorge triana the play was put on in spanish but with simultaneous translation to english at repertorio español www
repertorio
org chivo in new york in <year> and the production moved to lima in <year>
a feature of the novel 's stage version is that the same actor plays both agustin cabral and rafael trujillo
for reviewer bruce weber this makes the point that trujillo 's control of the nation depended on gutless collaborators

regarded as one of the raaf 's most skilful cross @-@ country pilots and navigators eaton came to public attention as leader of three military expeditions to find lost aircraft in central australia between <year> and <year>
in april <year> he coordinated the air force 's part in the search for aviators keith anderson and bob hitchcock missing in their aircraft the kookaburra while themselves looking for charles kingsford smith and charles ulm who had force landed the southern cross in north western australia during a flight from sydney
three of the raaf 's five ancient dh
<num> biplanes went down in the search — though all crews escaped injury — including eaton 's which experienced what he labelled a good crash on <num> april near tennant creek after the engine 's pistons melted
the same day captain lester brain flying a qantas aircraft located the wreck of the kookaburra in the tanami desert approximately <num> kilometres <num> mi east @-@ south @-@ east of wave hill
setting out from wave hill on <num> april eaton led a ground party across rough terrain that reached the crash site four days later and buried the crew who had perished of thirst and exposure
not a particularly religious man he recalled that after the burial he saw a perfect cross formed by cirrus cloud in an otherwise clear blue sky above the kookaburra
the air board described the raaf 's search as taking <num> hours flying time under the most trying conditions
where a forced landing meant certain crash
in november <year> eaton was selected to lead another expedition for a missing aircraft near ayers rock but it was called off soon afterwards when the pilot showed up in alice springs
the next month he was ordered to search for w
l
pittendrigh and s
j
hamre who had disappeared in the biplane golden quest <num> while attempting to discover lasseter 's reef
employing a total of four dh
<num> moths the raaf team located the missing men near dashwood creek on <num> january <year> and they were rescued four days later by a ground party accompanied by eaton

eaton was awarded the air force cross on <num> march <year> in recognition of his zeal and devotion to duty in conducting flights to central australia in search of missing aviators
the media called him the knight errant of the desert skies
aside from his crash landing in the desert while searching for the kookaburra eaton had another narrow escape in <year> when he was test flying the wackett warrigal i with sergeant eric douglas
having purposely put the biplane trainer into a spin and finding no response in the controls when he tried to recover eaton called on douglas to bail out
when douglas stood up to do so the spin stopped apparently due to his torso changing the airflow over the tail plane
eaton then managed to land the aeroplane he and his passenger both badly shaken by the experience
in december <year> he was posted to no
<num> aircraft depot at laverton where he continued to fly as well as performing administrative work
promoted squadron leader in <year> he undertook a clandestine mission around the new year to scout for suitable landing grounds in the dutch east indies primarily timor and ambon
wearing civilian clothes he and his companion were arrested and held for three days by local authorities in koepang dutch timor

following a <year> decision to establish the first north australian raaf base in april <year> eaton now on the headquarters staff of raaf station laverton and wing commander george jones director of personnel services at raaf headquarters began developing plans for the new station to be commanded by jones and a new squadron that would be based there led by eaton
the next month they flew an avro anson on an inspection tour of darwin northern territory site of the proposed base
delays meant that no
<num> general purpose squadron was not formed until <num> february <year> at laverton
jones had by now moved on to another posting but eaton took up the squadron 's command as planned
promoted to wing commander on <num> march he and his equipment officer flying officer hocking were ordered to build up the unit as quickly as possible and established an initial complement of fourteen officers and <num> airmen plus four ansons and four demons within a week
an advance party of thirty ncos and airmen under hocking began moving to darwin on <num> july
staff were initially accommodated in a former meatworks built during world war i and life at the newly established air base had a distinctly raw pioneering feel about it according to historian chris coulthard @-@ clark
morale though was high
on <num> august no
<num> squadron launched its first patrol over the darwin area flown by one of seven ansons that had so far been delivered
these were augmented by a flight of four cac wirraways replacing the originally planned force of demons that took off from laverton on <num> september the day before australia declared war and arrived in darwin four days later
a fifth wirraway in the flight crashed on landing at darwin killing both crewmen
in june <year> no
<num> squadron was cannibalised to form two additional units headquarters raaf station darwin and no

no
<num> squadron retained its wirraway flight while its two flights of ansons went to the new squadron these were replaced later that month by more capable lockheed hudsons
eaton was appointed co of the base gaining promotion to temporary group captain in september
his squadrons were employed in escort maritime reconnaissance and coastal patrol duties the overworked aircraft having to be sent to raaf station richmond new south wales after every <num> hours flying time — with a consequent three @-@ week loss from darwin 's strength — as deep maintenance was not yet possible in the northern territory
soon after the establishment of headquarters raaf station darwin minister for air james fairbairn visited the base
piloting his own light plane he was greeted by four wirraways that proceeded to escort him into landing the minister subsequently complimented eaton on the keen @-@ ness and efficiency of all ranks particularly considering the challenging environment
when fairbairn died in the canberra air disaster shortly afterwards his pilot was flight lieutenant robert hitchcock son of bob hitchcock of the kookaburra and also a former member of eaton 's no
<num> squadron

<num> wing which subsequently deployed to merauke in dutch new guinea comprising no

<num> squadron p @-@ <num> kittyhawk fighters and no
<num> squadron a @-@ <num> vengeance dive bombers
his relations with north @-@ eastern area command in townsville were strained mountains were made out of molehills in his opinion and he was reassigned that july to lead no
<num> bombing and gunnery school in port pirie south australia
on <num> november <year> eaton returned to the northern territory to establish no

<num> and no

he developed a good relationship with his dutch personnel who called him oom charles uncle charles
operating under the auspices of north @-@ western area command nwa darwin eaton 's forces participated in the new guinea and north @-@ western area campaigns during <year> in which he regularly flew on missions himself
through march – april his beaufighters attacked enemy shipping while the mitchells and beauforts bombed timor on a daily basis as a prelude to operations reckless and persecution the invasions of hollandia and aitape
on <num> april he organised a large raid against su dutch timor employing thirty @-@ five mitchells beauforts and beaufighters to destroy the town 's barracks and fuel dumps the results earning him the personal congratulations of the air officer commanding nwa air vice marshal king cole for his splendid effort
on the day of the allied landings <num> april the mitchells and beaufighters made a daylight raid on dili portuguese timor
the ground assault met little opposition credited in part to the air bombardment in the days leading up to it
in june – july no
<num> wing supported the allied attack on noemfoor
eaton was recommended to be mentioned in despatches on <num> october <year> for his gallant and distinguished service in nwa this was promulgated in the london gazette on <num> march <year>
completing his tour with no
<num> wing eaton was appointed air officer commanding southern area melbourne in january <year>
the german submarine u @-@ <num> operated off southern australia during the first months of <year> and the few combat units in eaton 's command were heavily engaged in anti @-@ submarine patrols which sought to locate this and any other u @-@ boats in the area
the air officer commanding raaf command air vice marshal bill bostock considered the sporadic attacks to be partly nuisance value designed to draw allied resources away from the front line of the south west pacific war
in april eaton complained to bostock that intelligence from british pacific fleet concerning its ships movements eastwards out of western area was hours out of date by the time it was received at southern area command leading to raaf aircraft missing their rendezvous and wasting valuable flying hours searching empty ocean
there had been no u @-@ boat strikes since february and by june the naval authorities indicated that there was no pressing need for air cover except for the most important vessels
in recognition of his war service he was appointed a commander of the order of orange @-@ nassau with swords by the dutch government on <num> january <year>
the same month he became australian consul in dili
he had seen an advertisement for the position and was the only applicant with experience of the area
while based there he accompanied the provincial governor on visits to townships damaged in allied raids during the war taking care to be circumspect about the part played by his own forces from no
<num> wing
in july <year> dutch forces launched a police action against territory held by the fledgling indonesian republic which had been declared shortly after the end of the war
following a ceasefire the united nations set up a commission chaired by eaton as consul @-@ general to monitor progress
eaton and his fellow commissioners believed that the ceasefire was serving the dutch as a cover for further penetration of republican enclaves
his requests to the australian government for military observers led to deployment of the first peacekeeping force to the region the australians were soon followed by british and us observers and enabled eaton to display a more realistic impression of the situation to the outside world
the dutch administration strongly opposed the presence of un forces and accused eaton of impropriety but the australian government refused to recall him
following the transfer of sovereignty in december <year> he became australia 's first secretary and chargé d 'affaires to the republic of the united states of indonesia
in <year> he returned to australia to serve with the department of external affairs in canberra
after retiring from public service in <year> he and his wife farmed at metung victoria and cultivated orchids
they later moved to frankston where eaton was involved in promotional work
charles eaton died in frankston on <num> november <year>
survived by his wife and two sons he was cremated
in accordance with his wishes his ashes were scattered near tennant creek site of his <year> forced landing during the search for the kookaburra from an raaf caribou on <num> april <year>
his name figures prominently in the northern territory commemorated by lake eaton in central australia eaton place in the darwin suburb of karama charles eaton drive on the approach to darwin international airport and the charles moth eaton saloon bar in the tennant creek goldfields hotel
he is also honoured with a display at the northern territory parliament and a national trust memorial at tennant creek airport
at the raaf 's <year> history conference air commodore mark lax recalling eaton 's search @-@ and @-@ rescue missions between the wars commented today we might think of eaton perhaps as the pioneer of our contribution to assistance to the civil community — a tradition that continues today
perhaps i might jog your memory to a more recent series of rescues no less hazardous for all concerned — the amazing location of missing yachtsmen thierry dubois isabelle autissier and tony bullimore by our p @-@ <num> that guided the navy to their eventual rescue
my observation is that such activities remain vital for our relevance in that we must remain connected supportive and responsive to the wants and needs of the australian community

of jezebel defended the actress writing that fey 's performance is supposed to be parodying precisely the kinds of media that reinforce ideas that unconventional women are unworthy

sophie caldecott of verily defended fey 's modesty and tendency to downplay her own physical appearance she mocks her own appearance sure but she does so in a way that consistently shows up our culture for placing so much importance on how women look as if that ’ s the most interesting thing about us
her comic persona on <num> rock liz lemon can be laughed at for many things but her career managerial style and ability is not one of them
caldecott concluded in reality self @-@ deprecation is an art that comedians everywhere dabble in
in fact i defy you to find a good male comedian who isn ’ t a master of self @-@ deprecation
comedians make fun of themselves for many reasons mostly because it is the most readily accessible source of inspiration but also because it is the most generous one
observing that fey 's material lacks whining gina barreca of the hartford courant wrote that fey 's comedy is not simply an iteration of self @-@ deprecating femininity passing itself off as humor

the island located on an arm of the arabian sea consists of two groups of caves — the first is a large group of five hindu caves the second a smaller group of two buddhist caves
the hindu caves contain rock cut stone sculptures representing the shaiva hindu sect dedicated to the lord shiva
the rock cut architecture of the caves has been dated to between the <num> and <num> centuries although the identity of the original builders is still a subject of debate
the caves are hewn from solid basalt rock
all the caves were also originally painted in the past but now only traces remain
the main cave cave <num> or the great cave was a hindu place of worship until portuguese rule began in <year> after which the caves suffered severe damage
this cave was renovated in the <num> after years of neglect and was designated a unesco world heritage site in <year> to preserve the artwork
it is currently maintained by the archaeological survey of india asi

the island covers about <num> km2 <num>
<num> sq mi at high tide and about <num> km2 <num>
<num> sq mi at low tide
gharapuri is small village on the south side of the island
the elephanta caves can be reached by a ferry from the gateway of india mumbai which has the nearest airport and train station
the cave is closed on monday
the island is <num>
<num> km <num>
<num> mi in length with two hills that rise to a height of about <num> m <num> ft
a deep ravine cuts through the heart of the island from north to south
on the west the hill rises gently from the sea and stretches east across the ravine and rises gradually to the extreme east to a height of <num> m <num> ft
this hill is known as the stupa hill
forest growth with clusters of mango tamarind and karanj trees cover the hills with scattered palm trees
rice fields are seen in the valley
the fore shore is made up of sand and mud with mangrove bushes on the fringe
landing quays sit near three small hamlets known as set bunder in the north @-@ west mora bunder in the northeast and gharapuri or raj bunder in the south
the two hills of the island the western and the eastern have five rock @-@ cut caves in the western part and a brick stupa on the eastern hill on its top composed of two caves with a few rock @-@ cut cisterns
one of the caves on the eastern hill is unfinished
it is a protected island with a buffer zone according to a notification issued in <year> which also includes a prohibited area that stretches <num> kilometre <num>
<num> mi from the shoreline
pandavas the heroes of the hindu epic mahabharata and banasura the demon devotee of shiva are both credited with building temples or cut caves to live
local tradition holds that the caves are not man @-@ made
the elephanta caves are of unknown date and attribution
art historians have dated the caves in the range of late <num> to late <num> century ad
archaeological excavations have unearthed a few kshatrapa coins dated to <num> century ad
the known history is traced only to the defeat of mauryan rulers of konkan by the badami chalukyas emperor pulakesi ii <num> – <num> in a naval battle in <num> ad
elephanta was then called puri or purika and served as the capital of the konkan mauryas
some historians attribute the caves to the konkan mauryas dating them to the mid @-@ <num> century though others refute this claim saying a relatively small kingdom like the konkan mauryas could not undertake an almost superhuman excavation effort which was needed to carve the rock temples from solid rock and could not have the skilled labor to produce such high quality sculpture
some other historians attribute the construction to the kalachuris late <num> to <num> century who may have had a feudal relationship with the konkan mauryas
in an era where polytheism was prevalent the elephanta main cave dedicates the monotheism of the pashupata shaivism sect a sect to which kalachuris as well as konkan mauryas belonged
the chalukyas who defeated the kalachuris as well as the konkan mauryas are also believed by some to be creators of the main cave in the mid @-@ <num> century
the rashtrakutas are the last claimants to the creation of the main cave approximated to the early <num> to late <num> century
the elephanta shiva cave resembles in some aspects the <num> @-@ century rashtrakuta rock @-@ temple kailash at ellora
the trimurti of elephanta showing the three faces of shiva is akin to the trimurti of brahma vishnu and mahesh shiva which was the royal insignia of the rashtrakutas
the nataraja and ardhanarishvara sculptures are also attributed to the rashtrakutas
later elephanta was ruled by another chalukyan dynasty and then by gujarat sultanate who surrendered it to the portuguese in <year>
by then elephanta was called gharapuri which denotes a hill settlement
the name is still used in the local marathi language
the portuguese named the island elephanta island in honour of a huge rock @-@ cut black stone statue of an elephant that was then installed on a mound a short distance east of gharapuri village
the elephant now sits in the jijamata udyaan zoo in mumbai
portuguese rule saw a decline in the hindu population on the island and the abandonment of the shiva cave main cave as a regular hindu place of worship though worship on mahashivratri the festival of shiva continued and still does
the portuguese did considerable damage to the sanctuaries
portuguese soldiers used the reliefs of shiva in the main cave for target practice sparing only the trimurti sculpture
they also removed an inscription related to the creation of the caves
while some historians solely blame the portuguese for the destruction of the caves others also cite water @-@ logging and dripping rainwater as additional damaging factors
the portuguese left in <year> as per the marriage treaty of charles ii of england and catherine of braganza daughter of king john iv of portugal
this marriage shifted possession of the islands to the british empire as part of catherine 's dowry to charles
though the main cave was restored in the <num> other caves including three consisting of important sculptures are still badly damaged
the caves were designated a unesco world heritage site in <year> as per the cultural criteria of unesco the caves represent a masterpiece of human creative genius and bear a unique or at least exceptional testimony to a cultural tradition or to a civilisation which is living or which has disappeared
the caves are hewn from solid basalt rock
all caves were painted in the past but only traces remain

this hill is named after the religious stupa monument that they display
one of the two caves is incomplete while the other contains a stupa made in brick
at the entrance are four doors with three open porticoes and an aisle at the back
pillars six in each row divide the hall into a series of smaller chambers
the roof of the hall has concealed beams supported by stone columns joined together by capitals
the cave entrance is aligned with the north – south axis unusual for a shiva shrine normally east – west
the northern entrance to the cave which has <num> @,@ <num> steep steps is flanked by two panels of shiva dated to the gupta period
the left panel depicts yogishvara the lord of yoga and the right shows nataraja shiva as the lord of dance

other carvings related to the legend of shiva are also seen in the main hall at strategic locations in exclusive cubicles these include kalyanasundaramurti depicting shiva 's marriage to the goddess parvati andhakasuravadamurti or andhakasuramardana the slaying of the demon andhaka by shiva shiva @-@ parvati on mount kailash the abode of shiva and ravananugraha depicting the demon @-@ king ravana shaking kailash
the main cave blends chalukyan architectural features such as massive figures of the divinities guardians and square pillars with custom capitals with gupta artistic characteristics like the depiction of mountains and clouds and female hairstyles
the four @-@ armed shiva is seen with a crown and a disc behind it all damaged the sacred thread across his chest and a dressing gown covering up to the knee

shiva 's attendant the skeleton @-@ like bhringi is seated at his feet
other figures not distinct depict among others a royal @-@ looking tall person ascetics a fat figure a dwarf a bull the mount of shiva features of a garuda and two monkeys
the scenic beauty of the mountain is sculpted with the sky background amidst heavenly beings showering flowers on shiva @-@ parvati
this scene is interpreted as a gambling scene where parvati is angry as shiva cheats in a game of dice
the carved panel facing this one is a two @-@ level depiction of ravana lifting kailash
the upper scene is mount kailash where shiva and parvati are seated
the eight @-@ armed three @-@ eyed shiva wears headgear with a crescent and disc behind it

around ravana are several demons
numerous figures are seen above shiva the god vishnu riding his mount garuda to his left a skeleton @-@ figure and in a recess parvati 's mount a tiger is depicted
a legend relates to both these panels
once parvati was annoyed with shiva
at this moment ravana who was passing by mount kailash found it as an obstruction to his movement
upset ravana shook it vigorously and as a result parvati got scared and hugged shiva
enraged by ravana 's arrogance shiva stamped down on ravana who sang praises of shiva to free him of his misery and turned into an ardent devotee of shiva
another version states that shiva was pleased with ravana for restoring parvati 's composure and blessed him
it is also known as trimurti sadashiva and maheshmurti
the image <num> m <num> ft in height depicts a three @-@ headed shiva representing panchamukha shiva
the three heads are said to represent three essential aspects of shiva creation protection and destruction
the right half @-@ face west face shows him as a young person with sensuous lips embodying life and its vitality
in his hand he holds an object resembling a rosebud depicting the promise of life and creativity
this face is closest to that of brahma the creator or uma or vamadeva the feminine side of shiva and creator of joy and beauty
the left half @-@ face east face is that of a moustached young man displaying anger
this is shiva as the terrifying aghora or bhairava the one whose anger can engulf the entire world in flames leaving only ashes behind

he was the founder songwriter vocalist and guitarist in extreme metal band strapping young lad from <year> to <year> and has an extensive career as a solo artist
after performing in a number of heavy metal bands in high school townsend was discovered by a record label in <year> and was asked to perform lead vocals on steve vai 's album sex religion
after recording and touring with vai townsend was discouraged by what he found in the music industry and vented his anger on the solo album heavy as a really heavy thing released under the pseudonym strapping young lad
he soon assembled a band under the name and released the critically acclaimed city in <year>
since then he has released three more studio albums with strapping young lad along with solo material released under his own independent record label hevydevy records
townsend 's solo albums a diverse mix of hard rock progressive metal ambient and new @-@ age have featured a varying lineup of supporting musicians
in <year> he formed the devin townsend band a dedicated lineup which recorded and toured for two of his solo releases
in <year> he disbanded both strapping young lad and the devin townsend band taking a break from touring to spend more time with his family
after a two @-@ year hiatus he began recording again and soon announced the formation of the devin townsend project
the project began with a series of four albums released from <year> to <year> each written in a different style and townsend continues to record and tour under the new moniker
across all his bands and projects townsend has released twenty @-@ three studio albums and three live albums
townsend 's trademark production style featuring a heavily multitracked wall of sound has been compared to the styles of phil spector and frank zappa
his versatile vocal delivery ranges from screaming to an opera @-@ esque singing and his songwriting is similarly diverse
townsend 's musical style is rooted in metal and his albums are written to express different aspects of his personality
townsend picked up the banjo when he was five and began playing guitar when he was <num>
as an early teenager he befriended brian beav waddell who would later play guitars as part of the devin townsend band and bass on the devin townsend project
he participated in several metal bands while he was in high school and founded grey skies at the age of <num>
around the same time he joined a popular local group called caustic thought replacing jed simon on guitar and playing alongside bassist byron stroud both of whom would later become members of townsend 's flagship band strapping young lad
in <year> townsend began writing material under the name noisescapes a project he later described as just as violent as strapping young lad
townsend recorded a noisescapes demo and sent copies to various record labels
relativity records responded to townsend with a record deal and townsend began work on what was to be the first noisescapes album promise
shortly afterward the label introduced him to musician steve vai
impressed with townsend 's vocal work vai offered him the role of the lead vocalist on his new album sex and religion
after recording sex and religion townsend accompanied vai on a world tour in support of the album
townsend soon landed a second touring gig this time with the opening band of vai 's tour the wildhearts
he played live with the band throughout half of <year> in europe and appeared as a guest musician on their single urge
ginger the band 's frontman remained close friends with townsend later co @-@ writing several songs on <num> and the christeen <num> demos ep
while on tour with the wildhearts townsend formed a short @-@ lived thrash metal project with metallica 's then @-@ bassist jason newsted
the band known as ir8 featured newsted on vocals and bass townsend on guitar and tom hunting of exodus on drums
the group recorded a few songs together although townsend says that they never intended to go further than that
people heard about it and thought we wanted to put out a cd which is absolutely not true he explains
people took this project way too seriously
a demo tape was put together but the material was not released until <year> when newsted published the ir8 vs
sexoturica compilation
though townsend was proud of what he had accomplished so early in his career he was discouraged by his experience with the music industry
i was becoming a product of somebody else 's imagination and it was mixing with my own personality he later reflected
this combination was appalling
he pushed to get his own projects off the ground
despite getting notable touring gigs with other musicians however townsend continued to face rejection of his own music
relativity records dropped noisescapes from their label shortly after townsend accepted vai 's offer seeing no commercial appeal in townsend 's music
i have a hunch they only offered me a deal to get me to sing with steve he mused
while touring with the wildhearts townsend received a phone call from an a r representative for roadrunner records expressing an interest in his demos and an intention to sign him
the offer was ultimately rescinded by the head of roadrunner who regarded townsend 's recordings as just noise
he agreed to a five @-@ album deal with the record label and also provided much of the guitar work on the <year> album millennium and the <year> album hard wired by vancouver industrial band front line assembly
townsend began to record material under the pseudonym strapping young lad
he avoided using his real name at this point in career looking for a fresh start after his high @-@ profile vai gig
at the beginning i wanted to avoid at all cost to use my name because i was known as the singer for steve vai and it wasn 't the best publicity to have he later explained
i was playing somebody else 's music and i was judged in respect to that music
townsend produced and performed nearly all the instruments on the debut studio album heavy as a really heavy thing which was released in april <year>
following the release of the record townsend and several other musician friends he knew in vancouver recorded his first solo album in <year> entitled punky brüster – cooked on phonics
written and recorded in under a month the album was produced as a parody of punk rock bands and documents the act of selling out for mainstream success
townsend founded his own independent record label hevydevy records to release the album
townsend assembled a permanent lineup of strapping young lad to record city including prolific metal drummer gene hoglan along with townsend 's former bandmates jed simon on guitar and byron stroud on bass
the industrial @-@ influenced album was released in <year>
to this day the album is widely considered strapping young lad 's best work with metal maniacs calling it groundbreaking and revolver naming it one of the greatest metal albums of all time
townsend himself considers it the band 's ultimate album
later that year townsend released his second solo album ocean machine biomech
the album featured a mix of hard rock ambient and progressive rock
after the completion of city and ocean machine biomech townsend began to approach a mental breakdown
i started to see human beings as little lonesome water based pink meat he explained life forms pushing air through themselves and making noises that the other little pieces of meat seemed to understand
in <year> he checked himself into a mental @-@ health hospital where he was diagnosed with bipolar disorder
the diagnosis helped him understand where the two sides of his music were coming from he felt his disorder gave birth to the two extremes that are strapping 's city record and ocean machine biomech
after being discharged from the hospital townsend found that everything just clicked and he was able to write his third solo album <num> which he described as the parent project of city and ocean machine biomech with music influenced by broadway
townsend returned to the studio accompanied by hoglan to work on the album on which townsend played most of the instruments
<num> was released in october <year>
later in his career townsend has cited <num> as his favorite solo record
with <num> townsend began to label all albums outside of strapping young lad under his own name dropping the ocean machine moniker to reduce confusion
he wanted to show that despite the highly varied nature of his projects they are all simply aspects of his identity
the album biomech was relabeled and redistributed as ocean machine biomech under townsend 's name to reflect the new arrangement
townsend 's bandmates began to play two sets at their shows one as strapping young lad and one as the devin townsend band playing songs from townsend 's solo albums
after the creation of the ir8 demo tape townsend and jason newsted had begun work on a new project called fizzicist which they described as heavier than strapping young lad
when the ir8 tape was leaked newsted 's metallica bandmates james hetfield and lars ulrich learned of the project
hetfield was fucking pissed that newsted was playing outside the band and newsted was prevented by his bandmates from working on any more side projects
with the project stalled townsend instead wrote the album himself entitling it physicist
townsend assembled his strapping young lad bandmates to record it the only time this lineup was featured on a devin townsend album
the thrash @-@ influenced physicist was released in june <year> and is generally considered a low point in townsend 's career
hoglan and the rest of the band were dissatisfied with the way the sound was mixed and townsend considers it his worst album to date
feeling he had ostracized a bunch of fans with physicist townsend felt he had the chance to make a more personal and honest record
townsend was inspired one morning while driving across canada with his band and looked to write an introspective album dedicated to his homeland
he produced and recorded terria a highly illustrated stream @-@ of @-@ consciousness album with gene hoglan on drums craig mcfarland on bass and jamie meyer on keyboards
townsend cited ween 's white pepper as an inspiration for the album
terria was released in november <year>
after a five @-@ year break from recording strapping young lad reunited to record a new album
townsend credits the album strapping young lad as an emotional response to the attacks of september <num> <year> in the united states
if the world 's about to blow up said townsend let 's write the soundtrack for it
the album 's lyrics were based more around fear and insecurity than the hostile lyrics of city
musically strapping young lad was less industrial than city and more reminiscent of death metal with a larger @-@ than @-@ life rock production style
townsend cited front line assembly grotus and samael 's passage as influences
the self @-@ titled album was released in february <year>
it received lukewarm reviews with critics finding it inferior to city but it was the band 's first charting album entering at <num> place on billboard 's top heatseekers chart
while strapping young lad was being reunited townsend formed a new permanent band on par with strapping to record and tour for his solo releases
the devin townsend band consisted of brian beav waddell on guitar mike young on bass ryan van poederooyen on drums and dave young on keyboards
townsend performed guitar vocals and production as he did in strapping young lad
townsend worked on the band 's first album accelerated evolution at the same time he was working on strapping young lad spending half the week on one and half on the other
accelerated evolution named for the pace of putting a new band together in under a year was released a month after strapping young lad
mike g
of metal maniacs called it the album of the year praising it for the hard @-@ to @-@ accomplish trick of being extreme yet accessible simultaneously heavy n rockin yet majestic and beautiful
prior to the formation of the devin townsend band townsend had represented his solo releases live with the strapping young lad lineup the band would play one set of strapping young lad songs and one set of devin townsend songs
after the release of accelerated evolution townsend 's two bands toured separately for their separate albums
strapping young lad began working on their next album alien in march <year>
feeling that the band 's previous album did not live up to expectations townsend decided to take his music to a new extreme
to prepare for the new album townsend stopped taking the medication prescribed to treat his bipolar disorder
i think that as an artist in order for me to get to the next plateau i kind of feel the need to explore things and sometimes that exploration leads you to places that are a little crazy he explains
and alien was no exception with that
although townsend considered the album an impenetrable mass of technicality it was well received on its release selling <num> @,@ <num> copies in its first week and appearing on several billboard charts
around this time townsend also contributed to the soundtrack of the video game fallout brotherhood of steel
shortly thereafter townsend began putting together the next devin townsend band record with the working title human
townsend intended the album as the more pleasant counterpart to alien
it 's basically a record about coming back down to earth after being in space with alien for a while
the album ended up being renamed synchestra and was released in january <year>
townsend showcased a wide variety of musical styles in synchestra blending his trademark pop metal with influences from folk polka and middle eastern music
the final strapping young lad album the new black was released later in <year>
from home townsend completed his second solo ambient album the hummer releasing it exclusively on his website in november <year>
in may <year> townsend released ziltoid the omniscient a tongue @-@ in @-@ cheek rock opera about the eponymous fictional alien
this was truly a solo album he programmed the drums using drumkit from hell a software drum machine that uses samples recorded by tomas haake of meshuggah and played all other instruments himself
shortly after the album 's release townsend announced that he no longer planned to tour or make albums with strapping young lad or the devin townsend band
he explained that he was burnt out on travelling touring and self promotion and wished to do production work write albums and spend time with his family without the stress of interviews or touring
in <year> townsend lent his voice to characters in several episodes of the adult swim cartoon metalocalypse see musician cameos in metalocalypse for more
the original character design for pickles the drummer one of the series main characters bore a striking resemblance to townsend
the series co @-@ creator brendon small acknowledged the similarity and altered the design before the series began
we made sure he didn 't look like devin townsend
we gave him the goatee and the dreadover so he wouldn 't look like that
townsend found it disconcerting that he had difficulty writing music without drugs and that he had trouble identifying his purpose as a musician
he spent a year producing albums in absence of writing but found it unrewarding and decided to pick up the guitar and just write
this began a period of self discovery where he learned how to create without drugs
over two years townsend wrote over <num> songs and found that they fit into four distinct styles
in march <year> townsend announced his plans for a four @-@ album series called devin townsend project with the goal of clarifying his musical identity and being accountable for the persona he projects to the public
the project 's concept includes a different theme and a different group of musicians on each album
ki the first album of the devin townsend project tetralogy was written to set the stage for the subsequent albums
townsend channelled his new @-@ found control and sobriety into ki a tense quiet album which contrasts with much of the music he had been known for
additional female vocals were provided by ché aimee dorval casualties of cool
ki was released in may <year>
the second entry a commercial yet heavy album called addicted was released in november <year> and features lead vocals from townsend and dutch singer anneke van giersbergen
brian beav waddell was recruited from the devin townsend band to play bass
townsend returned to the stage in january <year> touring north america with headliner between the buried and me as well as cynic and scale the summit

working with many projects simultaneously at that time townsend stated in <year> the obviouser project is vying for pole position until he wakes up and says he wants to do it
the album features ché aimee dorval from ki on vocals and morgan ågren on drums
townsend described the album sounds like haunted johnny cash songs and late night music highlighting it will be different than anything he has done before
townsend referred the music of the album to be closest to his heart at this point of his life and that it is an important and satisfying project he doesn 't want to rush
the album was completed on november <year> and a bonus disc was also made for the album containing the leftover material from the main album as well as songs from ghost <num> the unreleased compilation of leftover tracks from ghost
originally in <year> townsend stated that this album will be the sixth and the last album in the devin townsend project series but he ultimately confirmed that casualties of cool is its own project
townsend also started a crowdfunding campaign through pledgemusic to support the release of the album
the funding quickly reached its goal and all additional funds were put directly to townsend 's upcoming projects
casualties of cool was released on may <num> <year>
the album was re @-@ issued worldwide on january <num> <year> containing an additional dvd with live footage from the <year> concert at the union chapel in london
from <year> townsend worked on a long @-@ running album project called z <num> a sequel to the album ziltoid the omniscient <year>
originally in <year> he teased he may have just written the heaviest thing he 's ever done for the album and told there might a surprising lack of ziltoid himself appearing on the album
however in august <year> a london @-@ based radio station teamrock radio aired the first episode of ziltoid radio a satirical radio show hosted solely by ziltoid this being one element of the z <num> project
townsend also discussed a ztv or ziltoid tv is preceding the album
later townsend stated he has found the project hard to schedule and work with amidst touring and writing stating it takes a lot of effort to keep the content with tongue @-@ in @-@ cheek humour entertaining
after writing ideas for over <num> songs townsend stated he is finally going to finish the whole project followed by the announcement the album will be released on october <num> <year>
the recording process started in may <year> and the final project includes the album a ziltoid tv program and a live show with a big graphic novel comic and a documentary
the album itself is a double album with disc one being the main album and disc two featuring devin townsend project material according to townsend the album 's theme is ziltoid against the world
the devin townsend project disc is called sky blue and the ziltoid disc is called dark matters
after finishing the album townsend stated the project was punishing and an absolute nightmare to complete due to amount of material against tight schedules
he also described the hardship of the project by telling if he was ever going to start drinking again the last months would have been it but now he 's starting to get excited again
later after the chaos of finishing it had subsided townsend stated he is really satisfied with the result
townsend recently discussed at least a year @-@ long hiatus beginning after the z <num> show taking place at the royal albert hall on april <num> <year>
during the indefinitely long break townsend intends to recharge his batteries get some inspiration and experiences and to see what the next chapter holds for him
in <year> devin recorded a poppy sounding song in los angeles with producer brian howes but has decided against releasing
devin mentioned he is against the project being contrived due to the current hard rock undertones in popular music
he described it as a lukewarm heavy metal devin song
on december <num> <year> townsend announced via twitter that he was recording vocals for a song by steve vai
as of april <year> devin is in the middle of recording the seventh dtp album entitled transcendence at armoury studios in vancouver
she gave birth to their first son reyner liam johnstan townsend on october <num> <year>
he is a vegetarian
strapping young lad 's music was a diverse mix of extreme metal genres death metal thrash metal black metal and industrial metal
townsend 's solo material blends many genres and influences with elements of atmospheric ambient music hard rock and progressive rock along with pop metal and arena rock
he described it as a highly orchestrated type of expansive music based in hard rock and heavy metal
dense and produced with a large amount of ambient elements
despite strapping young lad 's greater mainstream acceptance townsend identifies more with his solo material and has never intended strapping young lad to be the focus of his music
townsend has drawn critical praise for his productions which are always marked by a sense of adventure intrigue chaotic atmospherics and overall aural pyrotechnics according to mike g
of metal maniacs
townsend mainly uses pro tools to produce his music alongside other software suites such as steinberg cubase ableton live and logic pro
townsend 's musical ideas and production style have drawn comparisons to phil spector and frank zappa
townsend has carried out the mixing and mastering for most of his solo work himself
he has also mixed and remixed work for other artists such as rammstein august burns red and misery signals
he now also uses open b tuning and open b flat tuning open c tuning tuned a half and a whole step down respectively on his six string guitars
townsend 's technique varies from fingerpicking power chords and polychords to sweep @-@ picked arpeggios and tapping techniques
he is also known for his heavy use of reverb and delay effects
he has expressed that he has no taste for shred guitar saying that musically it doesn 't do anything for me and that he only solos when he thinks that he can within the context of the song
his vocal range has been noted to be over <num> octaves c2 to f7
townsend has cited among others judas priest w
a
s
p
frank zappa broadway musicals abba new @-@ age music zoviet france king 's x morbid angel barkmarket grotus jane 's addiction metallica cop shoot cop and fear factory as his influences and has also expressed his admiration for meshuggah on several occasions calling them the best metal band on the planet
townsend lists paul horn and ravi shankar as the two most important musicians in his life
the two songs that townsend credits with changing the way he thought about music are the burning down by king 's x and up the beach by jane 's addiction
city was influenced by bands such as foetus and cop shoot cop and the new black 's influences were meshuggah and more traditional metal like metallica
he is also influenced by orchestral and classical composers such as john williams trevor jones and igor stravinsky

the moorish revival synagogue designed after the leopoldstädter tempel in vienna was located on modern @-@ day praška street
it has been the only purpose @-@ built jewish house of worship in the history of the city
it was one of the city 's most prominent public buildings as well as one of the most esteemed examples of synagogue architecture in the region
since the <num> plans have been made to rebuild the synagogue in its original location
due to various political circumstances very limited progress has been made
major disagreements exist between the government and jewish organizations as to how much the latter should be involved in decisions about the reconstruction project including proposed design and character of the new building
in <year> the jewish community had a rabbi and by <year> it had its own cemetery
as early as <year> the community was permitted to buy land for construction of a synagogue but did not have sufficient money to finance one at the time
by <year> the community had grown to <num> members and on october <num> of that year the decision was made to build a new jewish synagogue
the construction committee appointed in <year> selected and purchased a parcel of land at the corner of maria valeria street now praška street and ban jelačić square the central town square
however a new urban planning scheme of <year> reduced the area available for construction and the community decided to buy another parcel of <num> @,@ <num> square metres <num> @,@ <num> sq ft in maria valeria street approximately <num> metres <num> ft south of the original location
klein a representative of romantic historicism modeled the building on the viennese leopoldstädter tempel <year> a moorish revival temple designed by ludwig förster
it became a prototype for synagogue design in central europe
zagreb synagogue used the already developed round arch style rundbogenstil but did not adopt förster 's early oriental motifs
the composition of the main facade with its dominant drawn @-@ out and elevated projection and the two symmetrical lower lateral parts reflects the internal division into three naves
at ground @-@ floor level the front was distinguished by the three @-@ arch entrance and bifora whereas the first @-@ floor level had a high triforium with an elevated arch and the quadrifoliate rosettes on the staircases
the synagogue occupied the greater part of the plot facing west
it receded from the street regulation @-@ line in accordance with the rule then still enforced in austria – hungary prohibiting non @-@ catholic places of worship from having a public entrance from the street
the synagogue had a wider and slightly higher central nave and two narrower naves unlike förster 's synagogue in vienna it did not have a basilical plan
construction began in <year> and was completed the following year
the synagogue was officially consecrated on september <num> <year> a ceremony attended by representatives of city and regional authorities zagreb public figures and many citizens
it was the first prominent public building in zagreb 's lower town and its architecture and scale aroused general admiration and praise
the small minority of orthodox jews found this change to be intolerable and they began to hold their services separately in rented rooms
in the <year> earthquake the synagogue suffered minor damage and was repaired the following year
largely due to immigration from hungary bohemia and moravia the jewish population of zagreb quickly grew in size from <num> @,@ <num> members in <year> to <num> @,@ <num> members in <year> and then to <num> @,@ <num> members in <year>
the synagogue became too small to accommodate the needs of the ever @-@ growing community
in <year> a renovation was undertaken to increase the number of available seats
a <year> plan to increase the capacity to <num> seats was ultimately abandoned
a central heating system was installed in <year>
it was ruled by the extreme nationalist ustaša regime
the ustaša quickly started with the systematic persecution of the jews modeled after the nazi germany approach and at times even more brutal
racial laws were introduced jewish property was confiscated and the jews were subjected to mass arrests and deportations to death camps in croatia and abroad
in october <year> the newly installed mayor of zagreb ivan werner issued a decree ordering the demolition of the praška street synagogue ostensibly because it did not fit into the city 's master plan
the demolition began on october <num> <year> proceeding slowly so as not to damage the adjacent buildings it was finished by april <year>
the whole process was photographed for propaganda purposes and the photographs were shown to the public at an antisemitic exhibition first held in zagreb
it was also shown in dubrovnik karlovac sarajevo vukovar and zemun as an illustration of the solution of the jewish question in croatia
a fragment of the film footage of the demolition was discovered five decades later by the film director lordan zafranović during research for his <year> documentary feature decline of the century testimony of l
z
<num> seconds of the film survives
this footage was also shown in mira wolf 's documentary the zagreb synagogue <year> @-@ <year> <year> produced by croatian radiotelevision
the synagogue 's eight valuable torah scrolls were saved due to an intervention by leonardo grivičić an entrepreneur and industrialist who lived next door from mile budak a minister in the ustaša government
he was also close to poglavnik ante pavelić and the third reich 's ambassador to croatia edmund glaise @-@ horstenau
although grivičić did not have a significant political role in the independent state of croatia he was considered trustworthy
on october <num> <year> he learned about the regime 's plan to start the demolition of the synagogue on the following morning
by that evening grivičić secretly relayed the information to the synagogue 's chief cantor grüner and during the night the torah scrolls were moved to safety
shortly after the destruction of the synagogue the catholic archbishop of zagreb aloysius stepinac delivered a homily in which he said a house of god of any faith is a holy thing and whoever harms it will pay with their lives
in this world and the next they will be punished

the only surviving fragments of the building — the wash @-@ basin and two memorial tables from the forecourt as well as some parts of a column — were saved by ivo kraus
he pulled them from the rubble shortly after the end of world war ii
the wash @-@ basin and the memorial tables are now in the zagreb city museum
the column fragments are kept by the jewish community of zagreb
between <year> and <year> nearly one half of the surviving members of jewish community of zagreb opted for emigration to israel and the community dropped to one @-@ tenth of its pre @-@ war membership
the yugoslav communist regime nationalized virtually all real estate owned by the jewish community of zagreb including the plot in praška street
all this combined with the new regime 's general hostility toward religion made reconstruction of the synagogue nearly impossible
after world war ii the vacant site of the former synagogue was used as a makeshift volleyball court
the volleyball court made way for a prefabricated department store building constructed in <year>
the department store was completely destroyed in a fire on december <num> <year> and was subsequently dismantled
despite some earlier ideas about a permanent department store building on the same spot and a <year> architecture competition for its design no construction took place
instead the parcel was turned into a parking lot which it remains to this day
after <year> the jewish community of zagreb began to consider a jewish cultural center and a memorial synagogue
two architects branko silađin and boris morsan both of whom participated in the failed <year> department store competition came forward on their own accord and contributed their ideas for a new jewish center in praška street
silađin 's vision was ultimately not accepted by the jewish community instead plans were being made for the construction of the cultural center and a synagogue following an international architecture competition
however despite support for the project both within yugoslavia and abroad the issuance of necessary permits was either stalled or denied by the municipal government
the project was not developed
an architectural competition was planned for january <year>
political turmoil in the country followed by the breakup of yugoslavia and the croatian war of independence <year> – <year> caused the project to be put on hold again
in <year> president of croatia franjo tuđman said to jakov bienenfeld council member of the zagreb jewish community that they should build the new synagogue at the site of the former synagogue which will be funded by the croatian government
bienenfeld declined the offer believing to be inappropriate when <year> catholic churches are left destroyed at the time during croatian war of independence
in the meantime the jewish community of zagreb sought to legally reacquire its property
the croatian denationalization law was enacted in <year> and the praška street parcel was finally returned to the community on december <num> <year>
by <year> reconstruction activities were invigorated again
an investment study was submitted to the government of croatia and the city of zagreb in july <year> and revised in october <year>
the architecture competition was planned for <year>
however a <year> rift in the jewish community of zagreb resulted in formation of a splinter jewish community bet israel led by ivo and slavko goldstein
in september <year> the government of croatia formed a construction workgroup
it was decided that the project estimated at the time at hrk <num> million us <num> million would be partially financed by the government of croatia and the city of zagreb and that both jewish organizations should be represented in the workgroup
however the involvement of bet israel was deemed unacceptable by the jewish community of zagreb which is the sole owner of the praška street property and which also sees itself as the sole legal representative of the zagreb jewish community
as a consequence the community and its president ognjen kraus refused further participation in the project under the set conditions
further disagreements existed about the design and character of the new building
facsimile reconstruction while feasible was not seriously contemplated
there was a general agreement that the new building should also have a cultural as well as commercial purpose
while the jewish community of zagreb envisioned a modern design reminiscent of the original synagogue the bet israel advocated building a replica of the original synagogue 's facade perceiving it as having a powerful symbolism
opinions of architects urban planners and art historians were also divided along similar lines
in <year> and <year> the jewish community of zagreb presented new plans for a <num> @,@ <num> <num> <num> @,@ <num> sq ft multi @-@ purpose jewish center and synagogue in praška street

steering currents brought the storm northward and it approached charleston south carolina on <num> august where a generally easterly flow preceded the storm indicated its passage far east of the city
the hurricane made landfall at the mouth of the cape fear river in north carolina later that day though the earliest impacts from the storm started several days earlier with gusts initially toward the northeast but later curving southwestward
reports of similar wind shifts throughout the region suggested that the gale persisted stationary for several hours
it eventually moved back out to sea while south of norfolk virginia departing the region on <num> august

they use cameras camcorders and audio recorders to conduct overt surveillance of the public
an unsuccessful legal challenge has been made against their use of overt surveillance but in <year> the court of appeal ruled that they must justify retention of photographs on a case @-@ by @-@ case basis
any retained information is recorded on the crimint database
political activists have criticised fits and said that they feel the aim of fit deployment during protests is to prevent legal protests
journalists have also complained that fits attempt to stop them photographing protests and that they conduct surveillance of journalists
a campaign group fitwatch formed in <year> that aim to obstruct fits and conduct sousveillance on the officers
two members of the group were arrested at the <year> climate camp on obstruction charges
a similar police surveillance unit the video intelligence unit is operated by greater manchester police
in june <year> the home office announced it would review the use of fits during public order policing
they initially targeted football fans hunt saboteurs and political protesters since at least <year> using cameras camcorders and audio recorders to conduct overt surveillance of the public
the police officers wear full uniform and are intended to be a highly visible presence
their uniform is sometimes different from normal police officers in that the upper half of their yellow fluorescent jackets is blue
civilian photographers are also employed by the police to work alongside fits
according to scotland yard the aim of fit teams at protests is to record evidence of protesters in case disorder occurs later on at a protest
more recently the teams purpose has been extended to routine police work on low @-@ level crime and anti @-@ social behaviour and police forces throughout the uk now have their own fits
despite the implication in their name that their function is to merely gather intelligence they are also intended to have a deterrent effect
this approach has been reported to work in reducing reports of anti @-@ social behaviour at times when fits are deployed in specific neighbourhoods
jacqui smith then home secretary praised operation leopard that used fits to target youths in laindon essex stating operation leopard is exactly the sort of intensive policing that can bring persistent offenders to their senses
relentless filming of them and their associates throughout the day and night linda catt an activist has suggested that their tactics are designed to intimidate people and prevent lawful dissent
this view is echoed by a police debriefing of their operations at the <year> camp for climate action which praised fits at the event for disrupting activists
in june <year> the home office announced it would review the use of fits during public order policing
the move was influenced by the discovery that information collected by fits included that which was unrelated to suspected crimes for example recording who made speeches at demonstrations
in october <year> fit officers in plain clothes were spotted by a press photographer at a protest against companies avoiding tax despite commander bob broadhurst telling a parliamentary committee in may <year> that only uniformed officers distinguishable by their blue and yellow jackets were involved in gathering intelligence at protests
the metropolitan police told the guardian that it was necessary to deploy plain @-@ clothed officers to gather information to provide us with a relevant and up @-@ to @-@ date intelligence picture of what to expect
it was the first time that fits are known to have been deployed in plain clothes
in may <year> the court of appeal ruled that photographs collected by fits of people who have not committed a criminal offence can no longer be kept
the ruling was made after andrew wood an arms trade activist was photographed after challenging the management of reed elsevier at their agm over them organising arms trade exhibitions
wood argued that police had harassed him and infringed his right to privacy by photographing him
lord collins of mapesbury said that the police presence had a chilling effect on people who were protesting lawfully
fits have not been banned but they must now justify the retention of photographs on a case @-@ by @-@ case basis
as a result of the ruling the metropolitan police 's public order unit co11 was forced to delete <num> of the photos of protesters that it held
in a report about the policing of the <year> g @-@ <num> london summit protests denis o 'connor the chief inspector of constabulary stated that the routine use of fits at protests raises fundamental privacy issues and should be reviewed
he also said that there was confusion over the role of fits and advised that the home office should issue guidance over the legality of the surveillance of protesters and the retention of images
people are listed by name allowing police to determine which events individuals have attended
photographs obtained by fits are used to produce spotter cards consisting of people 's photographs which allows officers to identify people at future events that they attend
for £ <num> people are able to obtain a list of protests that they have attended from the data held on crimint under laws in the data protection act <year>
the report also noted that most of the people on spotter cards used by the police photographers were those involved in the organisation of protests and that fits also attend meetings where demonstrations are organised
in june <year> the guardian released video evidence recorded by a fit at the <year> climate camp of alleged police brutality against two female members of fitwatch
the women had asked police officers to reveal their shoulder numbers as at least four officers had not displayed them
the women attempted to photograph the police officers for evidence but were forced to the ground restrained with handcuffs and had their legs bound with straps
they were then placed in restraint positions arrested charged and held in custody for four days including three days in hmp bronzefield before they were released on bail
the police later retracted all the charges against the women
the women lodged a complaint with the ipcc over the incident
the journalist george monbiot commented on this case saying that the police are turning activism into a crime and that the fits methods appear to have been lifted from a stasi training manual
he claimed that anybody who is politically active is filmed identified monitored logged and cross @-@ checked
a police debrief into the operation at kingsnorth praised the deployment of fits saying that they were highly effective and gained good intelligence and disruption
three members of fitwatch were convicted for obstructing fit officers in june <year> as they attempted to photograph those attending a no borders meeting in london
in july <year> the inner london crown court overturned the men 's convictions with the judge stating that the protesters human rights may have been violated by the fit officers
on <num> november <year> the hosts of the fitwatch blog were asked by the police national e @-@ crime unit to take down the website due to it being used to undertake criminal activities
the request came after a post on the blog after the <year> student protest in london which advised students of actions they should take if they were concerned that they were photographed at the demonstration such as cutting their hair and disposing of clothing they were wearing
emily apple one of the founders of the site told the guardian nothing in that post giving guidance to student protesters has not been said before on our blog or on other sites
on <num> november <year> the fitwatch website returned hosted on a web server outside of the uk
the national union of journalists nuj has criticised fits for their surveillance and sometimes violent harassment of working journalists
marc vallee who was hospitalised by police after documenting a protest has said that the teams limit freedom of the press and called on the home office to confirm that the police had no right to restrict the work of photojournalists
bob broadhurst who is in charge of public order policing at the metropolitan police said in a statement to the nuj in <year> that journalists on the production of a valid form of accreditation will be able to continue with their work
the nuj are to make a formal complaint to the information commissioner due to the metropolitan police failing to provide details on the surveillance of journalists under the freedom of information act
bob broadhurst told photographers at an nuj conference that he had no faith in the national press card a form of press pass despite journalists needing to prove that they are bona @-@ fide newsgatherers to an independent authority before they are issued
the bbc tv series panorama produced an episode entitled what ever happened to people power in july <year> which discussed the use of fits in targeting activists and journalists
they also record footage of people involved in anti @-@ social behaviour on the streets
the aim is to give other police officers up to date information on the appearance of people who have broken the law
video footage thus collected is constantly replayed on tv screens in rooms where officers complete their paperwork
footage that they have recorded has also been uploaded onto youtube in an attempt to catch people they believe have reoffended
this has resulted in several offenders being sent back to prison after breaching licence conditions
since the unit was launched in <year> more than <num> people have been filmed by the unit
not all of these people are suspects in crime however people can be filmed if they are thought to associate with prolific offenders or if they have been stopped in an area of high crime under suspicious circumstances
kieran walsh a civil liberties lawyer said the unit 's work could have implications for the force under article <num> of the european convention on human rights the right to privacy
he believes that filming must be a proportionate and reasonable response to a crime and that this does not appear to be the case as people are being targeted over what they might do in the future
it is uncertain as to how long data collected by the unit is to be kept but gmp currently anticipate it will be stored for <num> years
pennsylvania trinsey v
pennsylvania <num> f
2d <num> was a case decided by the united states court of appeals for the third circuit that confirmed the validity of special elections held without a primary under the fourteenth and seventeenth amendments to the united states constitution
the case came about due to the death of h
john heinz iii one of the us senators from pennsylvania in a plane crash on april <num> <year>
under the seventeenth amendment state legislatures may give the governor the power to appoint officials to fill temporarily vacant senate seats until a special election can be held and pennsylvanian law contained a statute executing this and requiring no primaries for the special election
instead both the democrats and republicans would each internally select their candidates
john s
trinsey jr
a voter and potential candidate asked the united states district court for the eastern district of pennsylvania to declare the statute unconstitutional as a violation on the fourteenth and seventeenth amendments because the lack of a primary removed his right to properly vote for candidates and delegated that power to political parties
after deciding that the statute 's subject matter necessitated the strict scrutiny approach the district court decided on june <num> <year> that it was an unconstitutional violation of the right to vote for and select senate candidates
this decision was appealed to the court of appeals for the third circuit who decided against the use of the strict scrutiny approach and in its absence ruled that the statute was not a violation of the fourteenth and seventeenth amendments
academics have been critical of both the decision reached and the approach used with one suggesting that the substantial state interests test used in valenti v
rockefeller would be more appropriate
john heinz iii one of the us senators from pennsylvania was killed when his chartered plane collided with a helicopter inspecting its landing gear
under the seventeenth amendment to the united states constitution the legislature of each state has the power to permit the governor to fill the vacant seat until a special election can be held
in pennsylvania this power had been delegated and governor robert p
casey signed a writ on may <num> <year> declaring november <num> the date for a special election and temporarily appointing harris wofford to fill heinz 's now @-@ vacant seat
under pennsylvanian law there was no need for a primary in such a situation instead both the democrats and republicans would each internally select their candidate who would run in the special election
john s
trinsey jr
a member of the pennsylvanian electorate and potential candidate challenged the constitutionality of this law claiming that it violated his rights under the fourteenth and seventeenth amendments
trinsey argued that by failing to allow for primaries the state legislation prevented him from getting to select a candidate of his choice and that this violated the fourteenth amendment the terms of the statute and absence of a requirement for primaries also allegedly infringed the rights of the electorate under the seventeenth amendment which required the selection of senators by popular vote trinsey 's complaint was that the legislation had effectively delegated the power to choose candidates to political parties rather than the electorate
accordingly trinsey filed a motion for a declaratory judgment to state that the statute was unconstitutional and also requested that wofford be removed from his seat
counsel for the commonwealth of pennsylvania joined by the office of the governor argued that the constitution did not require the holding of primary elections to fill vacancies and that the statute protected valid and compelling state interests in protecting the validity of the electoral process and limiting the term of a governor- appointed senator
on june <num> <year> however the district court declared the statute unconstitutional stating that it violated both the fourteenth and seventeenth amendments due to the failure to ensure popular participation through the use of primary elections
this decision was reached following an analysis of the legislative history of the seventeenth amendment and electoral processes based on this analysis the court concluded that the pennsylvanian use of a nomination process before a special election implied a right to vote which was violated by the lack of a primary and necessitated a strict scrutinising of the legislation
after considering the evidence the court concluded that the interests the commonwealth put forth in support of the statute could not outweigh the infringement of the right to vote leading to the conclusion that the statute governing special elections was unconstitutional
with this the public press and political parties quickly turned their attention to the case with the republican state committee of pennsylvania supported by their democratic counterparts and several prominent politicians intervening
they moved to expedite an appeal to the court of appeals for the third circuit
in a unanimous opinion the court of appeals consisting of sloviter greenberg and seitz confirmed that there was no restriction of any fundamental right and therefore that the strict scrutiny process did not need to be applied
in the absence of this process they held that the seventeenth amendment did not require primary elections to fill vacancies and more broadly gave state legislatures wide discretion as to how to hold elections as such the statute did not violate the constitution
in december <year> the supreme court denied a writ of certiorari presumably because the special election had already taken place in november and the issue was thus moot
little writing in the temple law review notes the dearth of guidance for either the district court or court of appeals in trinsey with no explicit direction and no direct precedent from either the constitutional provisions or prior case law to rely on
in the absence of guidance the court of appeals took a narrow view of the issues something she criticises
under pennsylvanian law primaries are mandatory in all other elections and in her opinion the lack of a primary in this case should have been judged to be a violation of trinsey 's fundamental rights
combined with the purpose of the seventeenth amendment to ensure direct election this should have led to the application of the strict scrutiny test and the decision that the statute governing special elections was unconstitutional
kevin m

in valenti the judiciary applied the substantial state interests test which involves simply looking at whether the statute in question furthers the interests of the states who under the seventeenth amendment are given some discretion as to the electoral process they use

although jordan was a well @-@ rounded player his air jordan image is also often credited with inadvertently decreasing the jump shooting skills defense and fundamentals of young players a fact jordan himself has lamented
i think it was the exposure of michael jordan the marketing of michael jordan
everything was marketed towards the things that people wanted to see which was scoring and dunking
that michael jordan still played defense and an all @-@ around game but it was never really publicized
although jordan has done much to increase the status of the game some of his impact on the game 's popularity in america appears to be fleeting

policies aimed at cultural genocide resulted in the deaths of thousands of scholars and artists and the theft and destruction of innumerable cultural artifacts
the maltreatment of the poles was one of many ways in which the nazi and soviet regimes had grown to resemble one another wrote british historian niall ferguson
the occupiers looted and destroyed much of poland 's cultural and historical heritage while persecuting and murdering members of the polish cultural elite
most polish schools were closed and those that remained open saw their curricula altered significantly
nevertheless underground organizations and individuals – in particular the polish underground state – saved much of poland 's most valuable cultural treasures and worked to salvage as many cultural institutions and artifacts as possible
the catholic church and wealthy individuals contributed to the survival of some artists and their works
despite severe retribution by the nazis and soviets polish underground cultural activities including publications concerts live theater education and academic research continued throughout the war
not until the end of world war i was independence restored and the nation reunited although the drawing of boundary lines was of necessity a contentious issue
independent poland lasted for only <num> years before it was again attacked and divided among foreign powers
on <num> september <year> germany invaded poland initiating world war ii in europe and on <num> september pursuant to the molotov @-@ ribbentrop pact poland was invaded by the soviet union
subsequently poland was partitioned again – between these two powers – and remained under occupation for most of the war
by <num> october germany and the soviet union had completely overrun poland although the polish government never formally surrendered and the polish underground state subordinate to the polish government @-@ in @-@ exile was soon formed
on <num> october nazi germany annexed the western areas of pre @-@ war poland and in the remainder of the occupied area established the general government
the soviet union had to temporarily give up the territorial gains it made in <year> due to the german invasion of the soviet union but permanently re @-@ annexed much of this territory after winning it back in mid @-@ <year>
over the course of the war poland lost over <num> of its pre @-@ war population amid an occupation that marked the end of the second polish republic
many german officials and military officers were initially not given any clear guidelines on the treatment of polish cultural institutions but this quickly changed
immediately following the invasion of poland in september <year> the nazi german government implemented the first stages the small plan of generalplan ost
the basic policy was outlined by the berlin office of racial policy in a document titled concerning the treatment of the inhabitants of the former polish territories from a racial @-@ political standpoint
slavic people living east of the pre @-@ war german border were to be germanized enslaved or eradicated depending on whether they lived in the territories directly annexed into the german state or in the general government
much of the german policy on polish culture was formulated during a meeting between the governor of the general government hans frank and nazi minister of propaganda joseph goebbels at łódź on <num> october <year>
goebbels declared that the polish nation is not worthy to be called a cultured nation
he and frank agreed that opportunities for the poles to experience their culture should be severely restricted no theaters cinemas or cabarets no access to radio or press and no education
frank suggested that the poles should periodically be shown films highlighting the achievements of the third reich and should eventually be addressed only by megaphone
during the following weeks polish schools beyond middle vocational levels were closed as were theaters and many other cultural institutions
the only polish @-@ language newspaper published in occupied poland was also closed and the arrests of polish intellectuals began
in march <year> all cultural activities came under the control of the general government 's department of people 's education and propaganda abteilung für volksaufklärung und propaganda whose name was changed a year later to the chief propaganda department hauptabteilung propaganda
further directives issued in the spring and early summer reflected policies that had been outlined by frank and goebbels during the previous autumn
one of the department 's earliest decrees prohibited the organization of all but the most primitive of cultural activities without the department 's prior approval
spectacles of low quality including those of an erotic or pornographic nature were however an exception — those were to be popularized to appease the population and to show the world the real polish culture as well as to create the impression that germany was not preventing poles from expressing themselves
german propaganda specialists invited critics from neutral countries to specially organized polish performances that were specifically designed to be boring or pornographic and presented them as typical polish cultural activities
polish @-@ german cooperation in cultural matters such as joint public performances was strictly prohibited
meanwhile a compulsory registration scheme for writers and artists was introduced in august <year>
then in october the printing of new polish @-@ language books was prohibited existing titles were censored and often confiscated and withdrawn
in <year> german policy evolved further calling for the complete destruction of the polish people whom the nazis regarded as subhumans untermenschen
within ten to twenty years the polish territories under german occupation were to be entirely cleared of ethnic poles and settled by german colonists
the policy was relaxed somewhat in the final years of occupation <year> – <num> in view of german military defeats and the approaching eastern front
the germans hoped that a more lenient cultural policy would lessen unrest and weaken the polish resistance
poles were allowed back into those museums that now supported german propaganda and indoctrination such as the newly created chopin museum which emphasized the composer 's invented german roots
restrictions on education theater and music performances were eased
given that the second polish republic was a multicultural state german policies and propaganda also sought to create and encourage conflicts between ethnic groups fueling tension between poles and jews and between poles and ukrainians
in łódź the germans forced jews to help destroy a monument to a polish hero tadeusz kościuszko and filmed them committing the act
soon afterward the germans set fire to a jewish synagogue and filmed polish bystanders portraying them in propaganda releases as a vengeful mob
this divisive policy was reflected in the germans decision to destroy polish education while at the same time showing relative tolerance toward the ukrainian school system
as the high @-@ ranking nazi official erich koch explained we must do everything possible so that when a pole meets a ukrainian he will be willing to kill the ukrainian and conversely the ukrainian will be willing to kill the pole
countless art objects were looted and taken to germany in line with a plan that had been drawn up well in advance of the invasion
the looting was supervised by experts of the ss @-@ ahnenerbe einsatzgruppen units who were responsible for art and by experts of haupttreuhandstelle ost who were responsible for more mundane objects
notable items plundered by the nazis included the altar of veit stoss and paintings by raphael rembrandt leonardo da vinci canaletto and bacciarelli
most of the important art pieces had been secured by the nazis within six months of september <year> by the end of <year> german officials estimated that over <num> of the art previously in poland was in their possession
some art was shipped to german museums such as the planned führermuseum in linz while other art became the private property of nazi officials
over <num> @,@ <num> individual art pieces were taken including <num> @,@ <num> paintings by european painters <num> @,@ <num> works by polish painters <num> @,@ <num> sculptures <num> @,@ <num> manuscripts <num> @,@ <num> maps and <num> @,@ <num> books including over <num> @,@ <num> printed before <year> as well as hundreds of thousands of other objects of artistic and historic value
even exotic animals were taken from the zoos
twenty @-@ five museums and a host of other institutions were destroyed during the war
according to one estimate by war 's end <num> of the infrastructure of poland 's educational and research institutions and <num> of its museums had been destroyed
according to another only <num> of pre @-@ war poland 's <num> museums survived the war and just <num> of these institutions were able to reopen
of pre @-@ war poland 's <num> scientific institutions about half were totally destroyed and only a few survived the war relatively intact
many university professors as well as teachers lawyers artists writers priests and other members of the polish intelligentsia were arrested and executed or transported to concentration camps during operations such as ab @-@ aktion
this particular campaign resulted in the infamous sonderaktion krakau and the massacre of lwów professors
during world war ii poland lost <num> to <num> of its physicians and dentists <num> to <num> of its lawyers <num> to <num> of its teachers <num> to <num> of its scientists and university professors and <num> to <num> of its clergy
the jewish intelligentsia was exterminated altogether
the reasoning behind this policy was clearly articulated by a nazi gauleiter in my district any pole who shows signs of intelligence will be shot
as part of their program to suppress polish culture the german nazis attempted to destroy christianity in poland with a particular emphasis on the roman catholic church
in some parts of occupied poland poles were restricted or even forbidden from attending religious services
at the same time church property was confiscated prohibitions were placed on using the polish language in religious services organizations affiliated with the catholic church were abolished and it was forbidden to perform certain religious songs — or to read passages of the bible — in public
the worst conditions were found in the reichsgau wartheland which the nazis treated as a laboratory for their anti @-@ religious policies
polish clergy and religious leaders figured prominently among portions of the intelligentsia that were targeted for extermination
to forestall the rise of a new generation of educated poles german officials decreed that the schooling of polish children would be limited to a few years of elementary education
reichsführer @-@ ss heinrich himmler wrote in a memorandum of may <year> the sole purpose of this schooling is to teach them simple arithmetic nothing above the number <num> how to write one 's name and the doctrine that it is divine law to obey the germans
i do not regard a knowledge of reading as desirable
hans frank echoed him the poles do not need universities or secondary schools the polish lands are to be converted into an intellectual desert
the situation was particularly dire in the former polish territories beyond the general government which had been annexed to the third reich
the specific policy varied from territory to territory but in general there was no polish @-@ language education at all
german policy constituted a crash @-@ germanization of the populace
polish teachers were dismissed and some were invited to attend orientation meetings with the new administration where they were either summarily arrested or executed on the spot
some polish schoolchildren were sent to german schools while others were sent to special schools where they spent most of their time as unpaid laborers usually on german @-@ run farms speaking polish brought severe punishment
it was expected that polish children would begin to work once they finished their primary education at age <num> to <num>
in the eastern territories not included in the general government bezirk bialystok reichskommissariat ostland and reichskommissariat ukraine many primary schools were closed and most education was conducted in non @-@ polish languages such as ukrainian belorussian and lithuanian
in the bezirk bialystok region for example <num> of the schools that had existed before the war were closed down during the first two years of german occupation and by the end of the following year that figure had increased to <num>
the state of polish primary schools was somewhat better in the general government though by the end of <year> only <num> of prewar schools were operational and only <num> of prewar polish children attended them
a german police memorandum of august <year> described the situation as follows pupils sit crammed together without necessary materials and often without skilled teaching staff
moreover the polish schools are closed during at least five months out of the ten months of the school year due to lack of coal or other fuel
of twenty @-@ thirty spacious school buildings which kraków had before <year> today the worst two buildings are used
every day pupils have to study in several shifts
under such circumstances the school day which normally lasts five hours is reduced to one hour
in the general government the remaining schools were subjugated to the german educational system and the number and competence of their polish staff was steadily scaled down
all universities and most secondary schools were closed if not immediately after the invasion then by mid @-@ <year>
by late <year> no official polish educational institutions more advanced than a vocational school remained in operation and they offered nothing beyond the elementary trade and technical training required for the nazi economy
primary schooling was to last for seven years but the classes in the final two years of the program were to be limited to meeting one day per week
there was no money for heating of the schools in winter
classes and schools were to be merged polish teachers dismissed and the resulting savings used to sponsor the creation of schools for children of the german minority or to create barracks for german troops
no new polish teachers were to be trained
the educational curriculum was censored subjects such as literature history and geography were removed
old textbooks were confiscated and school libraries were closed
the new educational aims for poles included convincing them that their national fate was hopeless and teaching them to be submissive and respectful to germans
this was accomplished through deliberate tactics such as police raids on schools police inspections of student belongings mass arrests of students and teachers and the use of students as forced laborers often by transporting them to germany as seasonal workers
the germans were especially active in the destruction of jewish culture in poland nearly all of the wooden synagogues there were destroyed
moreover the sale of jewish literature was banned throughout poland
polish literature faced a similar fate in territories annexed by germany where the sale of polish books was forbidden
the public destruction of polish books was not limited to those seized from libraries but also included those books that were confiscated from private homes
the last polish book titles not already proscribed were withdrawn in <year> even polish prayer books were confiscated
soon after the occupation began most libraries were closed in kraków about <num> of the libraries were closed immediately while the remainder saw their collections decimated by censors
the occupying powers destroyed polish book collections including the sejm and senate library the przedziecki estate library the zamoyski estate library the central military library and the rapperswil collection
in <year> the last remaining polish public library in the german @-@ occupied territories was closed in warsaw
during the war warsaw libraries lost about a million volumes or <num> of their collections
more than <num> of these losses were the direct result of purges rather than wartime conflict
overall it is estimated that about <num> million volumes from state @-@ owned libraries and institutions perished during the war
polish flags and other symbols were confiscated
the war on the polish language included the tearing down of signs in polish and the banning of polish speech in public places
persons who spoke polish in the streets were often insulted and even physically assaulted
the germanization of place names prevailed
many treasures of polish culture – including memorials plaques and monuments to national heroes e
g
kraków 's adam mickiewicz monument – were destroyed
in toruń all polish monuments and plaques were torn down
dozens of monuments were destroyed throughout poland
the nazis planned to level entire cities
in <year> several german @-@ controlled printing houses began operating in occupied poland publishing items such as polish @-@ german dictionaries and antisemitic and anticommunist novels
censorship at first targeted books that were considered to be serious including scientific and educational texts and texts that were thought to promote polish patriotism only fiction that was free of anti @-@ german overtones was permitted
banned literature included maps atlases and english- and french @-@ language publications including dictionaries
several non @-@ public indexes of prohibited books were created and over <num> @,@ <num> polish writers were declared dangerous to the german state and culture
the index of banned authors included such polish authors as adam mickiewicz juliusz słowacki stanisław wyspiański bolesław prus stefan żeromski józef ignacy kraszewski władysław reymont stanisław wyspiański julian tuwim kornel makuszyński leopold staff eliza orzeszkowa and maria konopnicka
mere possession of such books was illegal and punishable by imprisonment
door @-@ to @-@ door sale of books was banned and bookstores — which required a license to operate — were either emptied out or closed
poles were forbidden under penalty of death to own radios
the press was reduced from over <num> @,@ <num> publications to a few dozen all censored by the germans
all pre @-@ war newspapers were closed and the few that were published during the occupation were new creations under the total control of the germans
such a thorough destruction of the press was unprecedented in contemporary history
the only officially available reading matter was the propaganda press that was disseminated by the german occupation administration
cinemas now under the control of the german propaganda machine saw their programming dominated by nazi german movies which were preceded by propaganda newsreels
the few polish films permitted to be shown about <num> of the total programming were edited to eliminate references to polish national symbols as well as jewish actors and producers
several propaganda films were shot in polish although no polish films were shown after <year>
as all profits from polish cinemas were officially directed toward german war production attendance was discouraged by the polish underground a famous underground slogan declared tylko świnie siedzą w kinie only pigs attend the movies
a similar situation faced theaters which were forbidden by the germans to produce serious spectacles
indeed a number of propaganda pieces were created for theater stages
hence theatrical productions were also boycotted by the underground
in addition actors were discouraged from performing in them and warned that they would be labeled as collaborators if they failed to comply
ironically restrictions on cultural performances were eased in jewish ghettos given that the germans wished to distract ghetto inhabitants and prevent them from grasping their eventual fate
music was the least restricted of cultural activities probably because hans frank regarded himself as a fan of serious music
in time he ordered the creation of the orchestra and symphony of the general government in its capital kraków
numerous musical performances were permitted in cafes and churches and the polish underground chose to boycott only the propagandist operas
visual artists including painters and sculptors were compelled to register with the german government but their work was generally tolerated by the underground unless it conveyed propagandist themes
shuttered museums were replaced by occasional art exhibitions that frequently conveyed propagandist themes
the development of nazi propaganda in occupied poland can be divided into two main phases
initial efforts were directed towards creating a negative image of pre @-@ war poland and later efforts were aimed at fostering anti @-@ soviet antisemitic and pro @-@ german attitudes
<num> million
hitler and stalin shared the goal of obliterating poland 's political and cultural life so that poland would according to historian niall ferguson cease to exist not merely as a place but also as an idea
the soviet authorities regarded service to the prewar polish state as a crime against revolution and counter @-@ revolutionary activity and arrested many members of the polish intelligentsia politicians civil servants and academics as well as ordinary persons suspected of posing a threat to soviet rule
more than a million polish citizens were deported to siberia many to gulag concentration camps for years or decades
others died including over <num> @,@ <num> military officers who perished in the katyn massacres
the soviets quickly sovietized the annexed lands introducing compulsory collectivization
they proceeded to confiscate nationalize and redistribute private and state @-@ owned polish property
in the process they banned political parties and public associations and imprisoned or executed their leaders as enemies of the people
in line with soviet anti @-@ religious policy churches and religious organizations were persecuted
on <num> february <year> the nkvd unleashed a campaign of terror against anti @-@ soviet elements in occupied poland
the soviets targets included persons who often traveled abroad persons involved in overseas correspondence esperantists philatelists red cross workers refugees smugglers priests and members of religious congregations the nobility landowners wealthy merchants bankers industrialists and hotel and restaurant owners
stalin like hitler worked to eliminate polish society
the soviet authorities sought to remove all trace of the polish history of the area now under their control
the name poland was banned
polish monuments were torn down
all institutions of the dismantled polish state including the lwów university were closed then reopened mostly with new russian directors
soviet communist ideology became paramount in all teaching
polish literature and language studies were dissolved by the soviet authorities and the polish language was replaced with russian or ukrainian
polish @-@ language books were burned even in the primary schools
polish teachers were not allowed in the schools and many were arrested
classes were held in belorussian lithuanian and ukrainian with a new pro @-@ soviet curriculum

dear majority of scholars believe that in the soviet occupation zone conditions were only marginally less harsh than under the germans
in september <year> many polish jews had fled east after some months of living under soviet rule some of them wanted to return to the german zone of occupied poland
all publications and media were subjected to censorship
the soviets sought to recruit polish left @-@ wing intellectuals who were willing to cooperate
soon after the soviet invasion the writers association of soviet ukraine created a local chapter in lwów there was a polish @-@ language theater and radio station
polish cultural activities in minsk and wilno were less organized
these activities were strictly controlled by the soviet authorities which saw to it that these activities portrayed the new soviet regime in a positive light and vilified the former polish government
the soviet propaganda @-@ motivated support for polish @-@ language cultural activities however clashed with the official policy of russification
the soviets at first intended to phase out the polish language and so banned polish from schools street signs and other aspects of life
this policy was however reversed at times — first before the elections in october <year> and later after the german conquest of france
in november <year> the poles of lwów observed the <num> anniversary of adam mickiewicz 's death
soon however stalin decided to re @-@ implement the russification policies
he reversed his decision again however when a need arose for polish @-@ language pro @-@ soviet propaganda following the german invasion of the soviet union as a result stalin permitted the creation of polish forces in the east and later decided to create a communist people 's republic of poland
many polish writers collaborated with the soviets writing pro @-@ soviet propaganda
they included jerzy borejsza tadeusz boy @-@ żeleński kazimierz brandys janina broniewska jan brzoza teodor bujnicki leon chwistek zuzanna ginczanka halina górska mieczysław jastrun stefan jędrychowski stanisław jerzy lec tadeusz łopalewski juliusz kleiner jan kott jalu kurek karol kuryluk leopold lewin anatol mikułko jerzy pański leon pasternak julian przyboś jerzy putrament jerzy rawicz adolf rudnicki włodzimierz słobodnik włodzimierz sokorski elżbieta szemplińska anatol stern julian stryjkowski lucjan szenwald leopold tyrmand wanda wasilewska stanisław wasilewski adam ważyk aleksander weintraub and bruno winawer
other polish writers however rejected the soviet persuasions and instead published underground jadwiga czechowiczówna jerzy hordyński jadwiga gamska @-@ łempicka herminia naglerowa beata obertyńska ostap ortwin tadeusz peiper teodor parnicki juliusz petry
some writers such as władysław broniewski after collaborating with the soviets for a few months joined the anti @-@ soviet opposition
similarly aleksander wat initially sympathetic to communism was arrested by the soviet nkvd secret police and exiled to kazakhstan
the polish underground state created a department of education and culture under stanisław lorentz which along with a department of labor and social welfare under jan stanisław jankowski and later stefan mateja and a department for elimination of the effects of war under antoni olszewski and bronisław domosławski became underground patrons of polish culture
these departments oversaw efforts to save from looting and destruction works of art in state and private collections most notably the giant paintings by jan matejko that were concealed throughout the war
they compiled reports on looted and destroyed works and provided artists and scholars with means to continue their work and their publications and to support their families
thus they sponsored the underground publication bibuła of works by winston churchill and arkady fiedler and of <num> @,@ <num> copies of a polish primary @-@ school primer and commissioned artists to create resistance artwork which was then disseminated by operation n and like activities
also occasionally sponsored were secret art exhibitions theater performances and concerts
other important patrons of polish culture included the roman catholic church and polish aristocrats who likewise supported artists and safeguarded polish heritage notable patrons included cardinal adam stefan sapieha and a former politician janusz radziwiłł
some private publishers including stefan kamieński zbigniew mitzner and the ossolineum publishing house paid writers for books that would be delivered after the war
most notably the secret teaching organization tajna organizacja nauczycielska ton was created as early as in october <year>
other organizations were created locally after <year> they were increasingly subordinated and coordinated by the ton working closely with the underground 's state department of culture and education which was created in autumn <year> and headed by czesław wycech creator of the ton
classes were either held under the cover of officially permitted activities or in private homes and other venues
by <year> about <num> @,@ <num> @,@ <num> students took part in underground primary education in <year> its secondary school system covered <num> @,@ <num> people and university level courses were attended by about <num> @,@ <num> students for comparison the pre @-@ war enrollment at polish universities was about <num> @,@ <num> for the <year> <year> year
more than <num> @,@ <num> secondary @-@ school pupils attended underground classes held by nearly <num> @,@ <num> teachers between <year> and <year> in four districts of the general government centered on the cities of warsaw kraków radom and lublin
overall in that period in the general government one of every three children was receiving some sort of education from the underground organizations the number rose to about <num> for children old enough to attend secondary school
it is estimated that in some rural areas the educational coverage was actually improved most likely as courses were being organized in some cases by teachers escaped or deported from the cities
compared to pre @-@ war classes the absence of polish jewish students was notable as they were confined by the nazi germans to ghettos there was however underground jewish education in the ghettos often organized with support from polish organizations like ton
students at the underground schools were often also members of the polish resistance
in warsaw there were over <num> underground schools with <num> @,@ <num> teachers and <num> @,@ <num> students
underground warsaw university educated <num> @,@ <num> students issuing <num> masters and <num> doctoral degrees
warsaw politechnic under occupation educated <num> @,@ <num> students issuing <num> engineering degrees <num> doctoral ones and <num> habilitations
jagiellonian university issued <num> masters and <num> doctoral degrees employed over <num> professors and teachers and served more than <num> @,@ <num> students per year
throughout poland many other universities and institutions of higher education of music theater arts and others continued their classes throughout the war
even some academic research was carried out for example by władysław tatarkiewicz a leading polish philosopher and zenon klemensiewicz a linguist
nearly <num> @,@ <num> polish scientists received funds from the underground state enabling them to continue their research
the german attitude to underground education varied depending on whether it took place in the general government or the annexed territories
the germans had almost certainly realized the full scale of the polish underground education system by about <year> but lacked the manpower to put an end to it probably prioritizing resources to dealing with the armed resistance
for the most part closing underground schools and colleges in the general government was not a top priority for the germans
in <year> a german report on education admitted that control of what was being taught in schools particularly rural ones was difficult due to lack of manpower transportation and the activities of the polish resistance
some schools semi @-@ openly taught unauthorized subjects in defiance of the german authorities
hans frank noted in <year> that although polish teachers were a mortal enemy of the german states they could not all be disposed of immediately
it was perceived as a much more serious issue in the annexed territories as it hindered the process of germanization involvement in the underground education in those territories was much more likely to result in a sentence to a concentration camp
in addition to publication of news from intercepted western radio transmissions there were hundreds of underground publications dedicated to politics economics education and literature for example sztuka i naród
the highest recorded publication volume was an issue of biuletyn informacyjny printed in <num> @,@ <num> copies average volume of larger publication was <num> @,@ <num> – <num> @,@ <num> copies
the polish underground also published booklets and leaflets from imaginary anti @-@ nazi german organizations aimed at spreading disinformation and lowering morale among the germans
books were also sometimes printed
other items were also printed such as patriotic posters or fake german administration posters ordering the germans to evacuate poland or telling poles to register household cats
the two largest underground publishers were the bureau of information and propaganda of armia krajowa and the government delegation for poland
tajne wojskowe zakłady wydawnicze secret military publishing house of jerzy rutkowski subordinated to the armia krajowa was probably the largest underground publisher in the world
in addition to polish titles armia krajowa also printed false german newspapers designed to decrease morale of the occupying german forces as part of action n
the majority of polish underground presses were located in occupied warsaw until the warsaw uprising in the summer of <year> the germans found over <num> underground printing presses whose crews were usually executed or sent to concentration camps
the second largest center for polish underground publishing was kraków
there writers and editors faced similar dangers for example almost the entire editorial staff of the underground satirical paper na ucho was arrested and its chief editors were executed in kraków on <num> may <year>
na ucho was the longest published polish underground paper devoted to satire <num> issues were published starting in october <year>
the underground press was supported by a large number of activists in addition to the crews manning the printing presses scores of underground couriers distributed the publications
according to some statistics these couriers were among the underground members most frequently arrested by the germans
under german occupation the professions of polish journalists and writers were virtually eliminated as they had little opportunity to publish their work
the underground state 's department of culture sponsored various initiatives and individuals enabling them to continue their work and aiding in their publication
novels and anthologies were published by underground presses over <num> @,@ <num> works were published underground over the course of the war
literary discussions were held and prominent writers of the period working in poland included among others krzysztof kamil baczyński leslaw bartelski tadeusz borowski tadeusz boy @-@ żeleński maria dąbrowska tadeusz gajcy zuzanna ginczanka jarosław iwaszkiewicz future nobel prize winner czesław miłosz zofia nałkowska jan parandowski leopold staff kazimierz wyka and jerzy zawieyski
writers wrote about the difficult conditions in the prisoner @-@ of @-@ war camps konstanty ildefons gałczyński stefan flukowski leon kruczkowski andrzej nowicki and marian piechała the ghettos and even from inside the concentration camps jan maria gisges halina gołczowa zofia górska romanowiczowa tadeusz hołuj kazimierz andrzej jaworski and marian kubicki
many writers did not survive the war among them krzysztof kamil baczyński wacław berent tadeusz boy @-@ żeleński tadeusz gajcy zuzanna ginczanka juliusz kaden @-@ bandrowski stefan kiedrzyński janusz korczak halina krahelska tadeusz hollender witold hulewicz ferdynand antoni ossendowski włodzimierz pietrzak leon pomirowski kazimierz przerwa @-@ tetmajer and bruno schulz
beginning in <year> the theaters were coordinated by the secret theatrical council
four large companies and more than <num> smaller groups were active throughout the war even in the gestapo 's pawiak prison in warsaw and in auschwitz underground acting schools were also created
underground actors many of whom officially worked mundane jobs included karol adwentowicz elżbieta barszczewska henryk borowski wojciech brydziński władysław hańcza stefan jaracz tadeusz kantor mieczysław kotlarczyk bohdan korzeniowski jan kreczmar adam mularczyk andrzej pronaszko leon schiller arnold szyfman stanisława umińska edmund wierciński maria wiercińska karol wojtyła who later became pope john paul ii marian wyrzykowski jerzy zawieyski and others
theater was also active in the jewish ghettos and in the camps for polish war prisoners
polish music including orchestras also went underground
top polish musicians and directors adam didur zbigniew drzewiecki jan ekier barbara kostrzewska zygmunt latoszewski jerzy lefeld witold lutosławski andrzej panufnik piotr perkowski edmund rudnicki eugenia umińska jerzy waldorff kazimierz wiłkomirski maria wiłkomirska bolesław woytowicz mira zimińska performed in restaurants cafes and private homes with the most daring singing patriotic ballads on the streets while evading german patrols
patriotic songs were written such as siekiera motyka the most popular song of occupied warsaw
patriotic puppet shows were staged
jewish musicians e
g
władysław szpilman and artists likewise performed in ghettos and even in concentration camps
although many of them died some survived abroad like alexandre tansman in the united states and eddie rosner and henryk wars in the soviet union
visual arts were practiced underground as well
cafes restaurants and private homes were turned into galleries or museums some were closed with their owners staff and patrons harassed arrested or even executed
polish underground artists included eryk lipiński stanisław miedza @-@ tomaszewski stanisław ostoja @-@ chrostowski and konstanty maria sopoćko
some artists worked directly for the underground state forging money and documents and creating anti @-@ nazi art satirical posters and caricatures or polish patriotic symbols for example kotwica
these works were reprinted on underground presses and those intended for public display were plastered to walls or painted on them as graffiti
many of these activities were coordinated under the action n operation of armia krajowa 's bureau of information and propaganda
in <year> three giant <num> m or <num> ft puppets caricatures of hitler and benito mussolini were successfully displayed in public places in warsaw
some artists recorded life and death in occupied poland despite german bans on poles using cameras photographs and even films were taken
although it was impossible to operate an underground radio station underground auditions were recorded and introduced into german radios or loudspeaker systems
underground postage stamps were designed and issued
since the germans also banned polish sport activities underground sport clubs were created underground football matches and even tournaments were organized in warsaw kraków and poznań although these were usually dispersed by the germans
all of these activities were supported by the underground state 's department of culture
cultural life was vibrant among both soldiers and the civilian population with theaters cinemas post offices newspapers and similar activities available
the <num> underground tournament of poetry was held during the uprising with prizes being weaponry most of the polish poets of the younger generation were also members of the resistance
headed by antoni bohdziewicz the home army 's bureau of information and propaganda even created three newsreels and over <num> @,@ <num> metres <num> @,@ <num> ft of film documenting the struggle
eugeniusz lokajski took some <num> @,@ <num> photographs before he died sylwester braun some <num> @,@ <num> of which <num> @,@ <num> survive jerzy tomaszewski some <num> @,@ <num> of which <num> survived
arkady fiedler based in britain with the polish armed forces in the west wrote about the <num> polish fighter squadron
melchior wańkowicz wrote about the polish contribution to the capture of monte cassino in italy
other writers working abroad included jan lechoń antoni słonimski kazimierz wierzyński and julian tuwim
there were artists who performed for the polish forces in the west as well as for the polish forces in the east
among musicians who performed for the polish ii corps in a polska parada cabaret were henryk wars and irena anders
the most famous song of the soldiers fighting under the allies was the czerwone maki na monte cassino the red poppies on monte cassino composed by feliks konarski and alfred schultz in <year>
there were also polish theaters in exile in both the east and the west
several polish painters mostly soldiers of the polish ii corps kept working throughout the war including tadeusz piotr potworowski adam kossowski marian kratochwil bolesław leitgeber and stefan knapp
norman davies wrote in god 's playground in <year> as a prize for untold sacrifices the attachment of the survivors to their native culture was stronger than ever before
similarly close @-@ knit underground classes from primary schools to universities were renowned for their high quality due in large part to the lower ratio of students to teachers
the resulting culture was however different from the culture of interwar poland for a number of reasons
the destruction of poland 's jewish community poland 's postwar territorial changes and postwar migrations left poland without its historic ethnic minorities
the multicultural nation was no more
the experience of world war ii placed its stamp on a generation of polish artists that became known as the generation of columbuses
the term denotes an entire generation of poles born soon after poland regained independence in <year> whose adolescence was marked by world war ii
in their art they discovered a new poland – one forever changed by the atrocities of world war ii and the ensuing creation of a communist poland
over the years nearly three @-@ quarters of the polish people have emphasized the importance of world war ii to the polish national identity
many polish works of art created since the war have centered on events of the war
books by tadeusz borowski adolf rudnicki henryk grynberg miron białoszewski hanna krall and others films including those by andrzej wajda a generation kanał ashes and diamonds lotna a love in germany korczak katyń tv series four tank men and a dog and stakes larger than life music powstanie warszawskie and even comic books – all of these diverse works have reflected those times
polish historian tomasz szarota wrote in <year> educational and training programs place special emphasis on the world war ii period and on the occupation
events and individuals connected with the war are ubiquitous on tv on radio and in the print media
the theme remains an important element in literature and learning in film theater and the fine arts
not to mention that politicians constantly make use of it
probably no other country marks anniversaries related to the events of world war ii so often or so solemnly
they were developed under the us <num>
<num> billion advanced technology vessel atv project to design and build nuclear @-@ powered submarines
the lead vessel of the class ins arihant was launched in <year> and after extensive sea trials was confirmed as ready for operations on <num> february <year>
arihant is the first ballistic missile submarine to have been built by a country other than one of the five permanent members of the united nations security council
in response the soviet union sent a submarine armed with nuclear missiles from vladivostok to trail the us task force
the event demonstrated the significance of nuclear weapons and ballistic missile submarines to then prime minister indira gandhi
following the <year> smiling buddha nuclear test the director of marine engineering dme at naval headquarters initiated a technical feasibility study for an indigenous nuclear propulsion system project <num>
the indian navy 's advanced technology vessel project to design and construct a nuclear submarine took shape in the <num>
then defence minister george fernandes confirmed the project in <year>
the initial intent of the project was to design nuclear @-@ powered fast attack submarines though following nuclear tests conducted by india in <year> at pokhran test range and the indian pledge of no first use the project was re @-@ aligned towards the design of a ballistic missile submarine in order to complete india 's nuclear triad
they will be the first nuclear submarines designed and built by india
the submarines are <num> m <num> ft long with a beam of <num> m <num> ft a draught of <num> m <num> ft displacement of <num> @,@ <num> tonnes <num> @,@ <num> long tons <num> @,@ <num> short tons and a diving depth of <num> m <num> ft
the complement is about <num> including officers and sailors
the boats are powered by a single seven blade propeller powered by an <num> mw <num> @,@ <num> hp pressurised water reactor and can achieve a maximum speed of <num> – <num> knots <num> – <num> km h when surfaced and <num> knots <num> km h when submerged
the submarines have four launch tubes in their hump and can carry up to <num> k @-@ <num> sagarika missiles with one warhead each with a range of <num> km or <num> mi or <num> k @-@ <num> missiles with a range of <num> @,@ <num> km or <num> @,@ <num> mi
the submarines are similar to the akula @-@ class submarine of russia
the indian navy will train on ins chakra an akula @-@ class submarine leased from russia in <year>
the miniaturized version of the reactor was designed and built by the bhabha atomic research centre barc at the indira gandhi centre for atomic research igcar in kalpakkam
it included a <num> @-@ metre <num> ft section of the submarine 's pressure hull containing the shielding tank with water and the reactor a control room as well as an auxiliary control room for monitoring safety parameters
the prototype reactor became critical on <num> november <year> and was declared operational on <num> september <year>
successful operation of the prototype for three years enabled the production version of the reactor for arihant
the reactor subsystems were tested at the machinery test center in visakhapatnam
facilities for loading and replacing the fuel cores of the naval reactors in berthed submarines were also established
the detailed engineering of the design was implemented at larsen toubro 's submarine design center at their hazira shipbuilding facility
tata power sed built the control systems for the submarine
the steam turbines and associated systems integrated with the reactor were supplied by walchandnagar industries
the lead vessel underwent a long and extensive process of testing after its launch in july <year>
the propulsion and power systems were tested with high @-@ pressure steam trials followed by harbor @-@ acceptance trials that included submersion tests by flooding its ballast tanks and controlled dives to limited depths
ins arihant 's reactor went critical for the first time on <num> august <year>
on <num> december <year> the submarine set off for its extensive sea trials
the first boat of the class ins arihant is expected to be commissioned by <year>
the first four vessels are expected to be commissioned by <year>
in december <year> the work on a second nuclear reactor began and the second boat ins aridhaman is being prepared for sea trials
the next three ships in the class after the lead ship will be larger and have <num> missile launch tubes to carry up to <num> k4 and a more powerful pressurized water reactor than ins arihant
a larger follow on class to the arihant class is also planned these new boats will be capable of carrying <num> to <num> ballistic missiles
she served in the imperial german navy during world war i
the battleship was laid down in november <year> and launched on <num> june <year>
she was formally commissioned into the imperial navy on <num> october <year> just over two months after the outbreak of war in europe
markgraf was armed with ten <num>
<num> @-@ centimeter <num>
<num> in guns in five twin turrets and could steam at a top speed of <num> knots <num> km h <num> mph
markgraf was named in honor of the royal family of baden
the name markgraf is a rank of german nobility and is equivalent to the english margrave or marquess
along with her three sister ships könig grosser kurfürst and kronprinz markgraf took part in most of the fleet actions during the war including the battle of jutland on <num> may and <num> june <year>
at jutland markgraf was the third ship in the german line and heavily engaged by the opposing british grand fleet she sustained five large @-@ caliber hits and her crew suffered <num> casualties
markgraf also participated in operation albion the conquest of the gulf of riga in late <year>
the ship was damaged by a mine while en route to germany following the successful conclusion of the operation
after germany 's defeat in the war and the signing of the armistice in november <year> markgraf and most of the capital ships of the high seas fleet were interned by the royal navy in scapa flow
the ships were disarmed and reduced to skeleton crews while the allied powers negotiated the final version of the treaty of versailles
on <num> june <year> days before the treaty was signed the commander of the interned fleet rear admiral ludwig von reuter ordered the fleet to be scuttled to ensure that the british would not be able to seize the ships
unlike most of the scuttled ships markgraf was never raised for scrapping the wreck is still sitting on the bottom of the bay
her keel was laid in november <year> and she was launched on <num> june <year>
at her launching ceremony the ship was christened by frederick ii grand duke of baden the head of the royal family of baden in honor of which the ship had been named
fitting @-@ out work was completed by <num> october <year> the day she was commissioned into the high seas fleet
she had cost the imperial german government <num> million goldmarks
markgraf displaced <num> @,@ <num> t <num> @,@ <num> long tons as built and <num> @,@ <num> t <num> @,@ <num> long tons fully loaded with a length of <num>
<num> m <num> ft <num> in a beam of <num>
<num> m <num> ft <num> in and a draft of <num>

she was powered by three bergmann steam turbines three oil @-@ fired and twelve coal @-@ fired boilers which developed a total of <num> @,@ <num> shp <num> @,@ <num> kw and yielded a maximum speed of <num> knots <num> km h <num> mph
the ship had a range of <num> @,@ <num> nautical miles <num> @,@ <num> km <num> @,@ <num> mi at a cruising speed of <num> knots <num> km h <num> mph
the ship had a crew of <num> officers and <num> @,@ <num> enlisted sailors
she was armed with ten <num>
<num> cm <num>
<num> in sk l <num> guns arranged in five twin gun turrets two superfiring turrets each fore and aft and one turret amidships between the two funnels
her secondary armament consisted of fourteen <num> cm <num>

<num> cm <num>
<num> in sk l <num> quick @-@ firing guns and five <num> cm <num> in underwater torpedo tubes one in the bow and two on each beam
markgraf 's <num>

<num> cm anti @-@ aircraft guns
the ship 's main armored belt was <num> millimeters <num> in thick
the deck was <num> mm <num>
<num> in thick the main battery turrets and forward conning tower were armored with <num> mm <num> in thick steel plates
by <num> january <year> the ship had joined iii battle squadron of the high seas fleet with her three sister ships
on <num> january <year> iii squadron was detached from the fleet to conduct maneuver gunnery and torpedo training in the baltic
the ships returned to the north sea on <num> february too late to assist the i scouting group at the battle of dogger bank
in the aftermath of the loss of sms blücher at the battle of dogger bank kaiser wilhelm ii removed admiral friedrich von ingenohl from his post as fleet commander on <num> february
admiral hugo von pohl replaced him as commander of the fleet von pohl carried out a series of sorties with the high seas fleet throughout <year>
the first such operation — markgraf 's first with the fleet — was a fleet advance to terschelling on <num> – <num> march the german fleet failed to engage any british warships during the sortie
another uneventful operation followed on <num> – <num> april and another three days later on <num> – <num> april
markgraf and the rest of the fleet remained in port until <num> may when the fleet conducted another two @-@ day advance into the north sea
on <num> – <num> september markgraf and the rest of iii squadron supported a minelaying operation off texel
another uneventful fleet advance followed on <num> – <num> october
vice admiral reinhard scheer became commander in chief of the high seas fleet on <num> january <year> when admiral von pohl became too ill from liver cancer to continue in that post
scheer proposed a more aggressive policy designed to force a confrontation with the british grand fleet he received approval from the kaiser in february
the first of scheer 's operations was conducted the following month on <num> – <num> march with an uneventful sweep of the hoofden
another sortie followed three weeks later on the <num> with another on <num> – <num> april
on <num> april the battlecruisers of rear admiral franz von hipper 's i scouting group conducted a raid on the english coast
markgraf and the rest of the fleet sailed in distant support
the battlecruiser seydlitz struck a mine while en route to the target and had to withdraw
the other battlecruisers bombarded the town of lowestoft unopposed but during the approach to yarmouth they encountered the british cruisers of the harwich force
a short artillery duel ensued before the harwich force withdrew
reports of british submarines in the area prompted the retreat of the i scouting group
at this point scheer who had been warned of the sortie of the grand fleet from its base in scapa flow also withdrew to safer german waters
the german fleet again sought to draw out and isolate a portion of the grand fleet and destroy it before the main british fleet could retaliate
markgraf was the third ship in the german line behind her sisters könig and grosser kurfürst and followed by kronprinz
the four ships made up the v division of the iii battle squadron and they were the vanguard of the fleet
the iii battle squadron was the first of three battleship units directly astern were the kaiser @-@ class battleships of the vi division iii battle squadron
the iii squadron was followed by the helgoland and nassau classes of the ii battle squadron in the rear guard were the obsolescent deutschland @-@ class pre @-@ dreadnoughts of the i battle squadron
shortly before <num> <num> the battlecruisers of i scouting group encountered the british 1st battlecruiser squadron under the command of vice admiral david beatty
the opposing ships began an artillery duel that saw the destruction of indefatigable shortly after <num> <num> and queen mary less than half an hour later
by this time the german battlecruisers were steaming south to draw the british ships toward the main body of the high seas fleet
at <num> <num> könig 's crew spotted both the i scouting group and the 1st battlecruiser squadron approaching
the german battlecruisers were steaming to starboard while the british ships steamed to port
at <num> <num> scheer ordered a two @-@ point turn to port to bring his ships closer to the british battlecruisers and a minute later the order to open fire was given
markgraf opened fire on the battlecruiser tiger at a range of <num> @,@ <num> yards <num> @,@ <num> m
markgraf and her two sisters fired their secondary guns on british destroyers attempting to make torpedo attacks against the german fleet
markgraf continued to engage tiger until <num> <num> by which time the faster battlecruisers managed to move out of effective gunnery range
during this period the battleships warspite and valiant of the <num> battle squadron fired on the leading german battleships
at <num> <num> one of the british ships scored a <num> @-@ inch <num> cm shell hit on markgraf
shortly thereafter the destroyer moresby fired a single torpedo at markgraf and missed from a range of about <num> @,@ <num> yd <num> @,@ <num> m
malaya fired a torpedo at markgraf at <num> <num> but the torpedo missed due to the long range
around the same time markgraf engaged a cruiser from the <num> light cruiser squadron before shifting her fire back to the <num> battle squadron for ten minutes
during this period two more <num> @-@ inch shells hit markgraf though the timing is unknown
the hit at <num> <num> struck on a joint between two <num> @-@ inch @-@ thick side armor plates the shell burst on impact and holed the armor
the main deck was buckled and approximately <num> t <num> long tons <num> short tons of water entered the ship
the other two shells failed to explode and caused negligible damage
shortly after <num> <num> the german cruiser wiesbaden had become disabled by a shell from the british battlecruiser invincible rear admiral paul behncke in könig attempted to position his four ships to cover the stricken cruiser
simultaneously the british iii and iv light cruiser squadrons began a torpedo attack on the german line while advancing to torpedo range they smothered wiesbaden with fire from their main guns
the obsolescent armored cruisers of the 1st cruiser squadron also joined in the melee
markgraf and her sisters fired heavily on the british cruisers but even sustained fire from the battleships main guns failed to drive them off
markgraf fired both her <num>
<num> cm and <num> cm guns at the armored cruiser defence
under a hail of fire from the german battleships defence exploded and sank credit is normally given to the battlecruiser lützow though markgraf 's gunners also claimed credit for the sinking
markgraf then fired on the battlecruiser princess royal and scored two hits
the first hit struck the <num> @-@ inch armor covering x barbette was deflected downward and exploded after penetrating the <num> @-@ inch deck armor
the crew for the left gun were killed the turret was disabled and the explosion caused serious damage to the upper deck
the second shell penetrated princess royal 's <num> @-@ inch belt armor ricocheted upward off the coal bunker and exploded under the <num> @-@ inch deck armor
the two shells killed <num> and wounded <num>
at the same time markgraf 's secondary guns fired on the cruiser warrior which was seriously damaged by <num> heavy shells and forced to withdraw
warrior foundered on the trip back to port the following morning
around <num> <num> admiral john jellicoe 's main force of battleships entered the battle orion began firing at markgraf at <num> <num> she fired four salvos of <num>
<num> @-@ inch armor @-@ piercing capped apc shells and scored a hit with the last salvo
the shell exploded upon impacting the armor protecting the no
<num> <num> cm gun casemate
the shell failed to penetrate but holed the armor and disabled the gun
the explosion seriously injured two and killed the rest of the gun crew
a heavy shell nearly struck the ship at the same time and at <num> <num> a bent propeller shaft forced markgraf 's crew to turn off the port engine naval historian john campbell speculated that this shell was the one that damaged the shaft
her speed dropped to <num> or <num> kn <num> or <num> km h <num> or <num> mph though she remained in her position in the line
shortly after <num> <num> the german battleships engaged the <num> light cruiser squadron markgraf fired primarily <num> cm shells
in this period markgraf was engaged by agincourt 's <num> @-@ inch guns which scored a single hit at <num> <num>
the shell failed to explode and shattered on impact on the <num> @-@ inch side armor causing minimal damage
two of the adjoining <num> @-@ inch plates directly below the <num> @-@ inch armor were slightly forced inward and some minor flooding occurred
the heavy fire of the british fleet forced scheer to order the fleet to turn away
due to her reduced speed markgraf turned early in an attempt to maintain her place in the battle line this however forced grosser kurfürst to fall out of formation
markgraf fell in behind kronprinz while grosser kurfürst steamed ahead to return to her position behind könig
after successfully withdrawing from the british scheer ordered the fleet to assume night cruising formation though communication errors between scheer aboard friedrich der grosse and westfalen the lead ship caused delays
several british light cruisers and destroyers stumbled into the german line around <num> <num>
in the ensuing short engagement markgraf hit the cruiser calliope five times with her secondary guns
the fleet fell into formation by <num> <num> with grosser kurfürst the <num> vessel in the line of <num> capital ships
around <num> <num> several british destroyers mounted a torpedo attack against the rear half of the german line
markgraf initially held her fire as the identities of the destroyers were unknown
but gunners aboard grosser kurfürst correctly identified the vessels as hostile and opened fire while turning away to avoid torpedoes which prompted markgraf to follow suit
heavy fire from the german battleships forced the british destroyers to withdraw
at <num> <num> markgraf and several other battleships fired at what they thought was a submarine
the high seas fleet managed to punch through the british light forces without drawing the attention of jellicoe 's battleships and subsequently reached horns reef by <num> <num> on <num> june
upon reaching wilhelmshaven markgraf went into harbor while several other battleships took up defensive positions in the outer roadstead
the ship was transferred to hamburg where she was repaired in ag vulcan 's large floating dock
repair work was completed by <num> july
in the course of the battle markgraf had fired a total of <num> shells from her main battery and <num> rounds from her <num> cm guns
she was hit by five large @-@ caliber shells which killed <num> men and wounded <num>
the ship was then temporarily assigned to the i scouting group for the fleet operation on <num> – <num> august
due to the serious damage incurred by seydlitz and derfflinger at jutland the only battlecruisers available for the operation were von der tann and moltke which were joined by markgraf grosser kurfürst and the new battleship bayern
the british were aware of the german plans and sortied the grand fleet to meet them
by <num> <num> scheer had been warned of the grand fleet 's approach and unwilling to engage the whole of the grand fleet just <num> weeks after the decidedly close engagement at jutland turned his forces around and retreated to german ports
markgraf was present for the uneventful advance in the direction of sunderland on <num> – <num> october
unit training with the iii squadron followed from <num> october to <num> november
two days later the ship formally rejoined iii squadron
on the <num> a pair of u @-@ boats grounded on the danish coast
light forces were sent to recover the vessels and iii squadron which was in the north sea en route to wilhelmshaven was ordered to cover them
during the operation the british submarine j1 torpedoed both grosser kurfürst and kronprinz and caused moderate damage
for most of <year> markgraf was occupied with guard duties in the north sea interrupted only by a refit period in january and periodic unit training in the baltic
the admiralstab navy high command planned an operation to seize the baltic island of ösel and specifically the russian gun batteries on the sworbe peninsula
on <num> september the order was issued for a joint operation with the army to capture ösel and moon islands the primary naval component was to comprise the flagship moltke along with the iii and iv battle squadrons of the high seas fleet
the ii squadron consisted of the four könig @-@ class ships and was by this time augmented with the new battleship bayern
the iv squadron consisted of the five kaiser @-@ class battleships
along with nine light cruisers three torpedo boat flotillas and dozens of mine warfare ships the entire force numbered some <num> ships supported by over <num> aircraft and six zeppelins
the invasion force amounted to approximately <num> @,@ <num> officers and enlisted men
opposing the germans were the old russian pre @-@ dreadnoughts slava and tsesarevich the armored cruisers bayan admiral makarov and diana <num> destroyers and several torpedo boats and gunboats
three british c @-@ class submarines where also stationed in the gulf
the irben strait the main southern entrance to the gulf of riga was heavily mined and defended by a number of coastal artillery batteries
the garrison on ösel numbered nearly <num> @,@ <num> men though by <year> it had been reduced to <num> to <num> percent strength
the operation began on <num> october when moltke and the four könig @-@ class ships covered the landing of ground troops by suppressing the shore batteries covering tagga bay
markgraf fired on the battery located on cape ninnast
after the successful amphibious assault iii squadron steamed to putziger wiek although markgraf remained behind for several days
on the <num> markgraf left tagga bay to rejoin her squadron in the gulf of riga but early on the following morning she ran aground at the entrance to kalkgrund
the ship was quickly freed and she reached the iii squadron anchorage north of larina bank on the <num>
the next day markgraf steamed to moon sound and on the <num> participated in the bombardment of russian positions on the island of kynö
the ship returned to arensburg on <num> october and two days later was detached from operation albion to return to the north sea
markgraf struck a pair of mines in quick succession while in the irben strait and took in <num> metric tons <num> long tons <num> short tons of water
the ship continued on to kiel via neufahrwasser in danzig she then went on to wilhelmshaven where the mine damage was repaired
the work was completed at the imperial dockyard from <num> to <num> november
after repairs were completed markgraf returned to guard duty in the north sea
she missed an attempted raid on a british convoy on <num> – <num> april <year> as she was in dock in kiel from <num> march to <num> may for the installation of a new foremast
the bulk of the high seas fleet was to have sortied from their base in wilhelmshaven to engage the british grand fleet
scheer — by now the grand admiral großadmiral of the fleet — intended to inflict as much damage as possible on the british navy in order to obtain a better bargaining position for germany despite the expected casualties
however many of the war @-@ weary sailors felt the operation would disrupt the peace process and prolong the war
on the morning of <num> october <year> the order was given to sail from wilhelmshaven the following day
starting on the night of <num> october sailors on thüringen and then on several other battleships including markgraf mutinied
the unrest ultimately forced hipper and scheer to cancel the operation
informed of the situation the kaiser stated i no longer have a navy
following the capitulation of germany in november <year> most of the high seas fleet ships under the command of rear admiral ludwig von reuter were interned in the british naval base in scapa flow
prior to the departure of the german fleet admiral adolf von trotha made clear to von reuter that he could not allow the allies to seize the ships under any conditions
the fleet rendezvoused with the british light cruiser cardiff which led the ships to the allied fleet that was to escort the germans to scapa flow
the massive flotilla consisted of some <num> british american and french warships
once the ships were interned their guns were disabled through the removal of their breech blocks and their crews were reduced to <num> officers and enlisted men
the fleet remained in captivity during the negotiations that ultimately produced the treaty of versailles
von reuter believed that the british intended to seize the german ships on <num> june <year> which was the deadline for germany to have signed the peace treaty
unaware that the deadline had been extended to the <num> reuter ordered the ships to be sunk at the first opportunity
on the morning of <num> june the british fleet left scapa flow to conduct training maneuvers and at <num> <num> reuter transmitted the order to his ships
markgraf sank at <num> <num>
the british soldiers in the guard detail panicked in their attempt to prevent the germans from scuttling the ships they shot and killed markgraf 's captain walter schumann who was in a lifeboat and an enlisted man
in total the guards killed nine germans and wounded twenty @-@ one
the remaining crews totaling some <num> @,@ <num> officers and enlisted men were imprisoned
markgraf was never raised for scrapping unlike most of the other capital ships that were scuttled
markgraf and her two sisters had sunk in deeper water than the other capital ships which made any salvage attempt more difficult
the outbreak of world war ii in <year> put a halt to all salvage operations and after the war it was determined that salvaging the deeper wrecks was financially impractical
the rights to future salvage operations on the wrecks were sold to britain in <year>
owing to the fact that the steel that composed their hulls was produced before the advent of nuclear weapons markgraf and her sisters are among the few accessible sources of low @-@ background steel which has occasionally been removed for use in scientific devices
markgraf and the other vessels on the bottom of scapa flow are a popular dive site and are protected by a policy barring divers from recovering items from the wrecks
constructed circa <num> bce during britain 's early neolithic period today it survives only in a ruined state
archaeologists have established that the monument was built by pastoralist communities shortly after the introduction of agriculture to britain from continental europe
although representing part of an architectural tradition of long barrow building that was widespread across neolithic europe the coldrum stones belong to a localised regional variant of barrows produced in the vicinity of the river medway now known as the medway megaliths
of these it is in the best surviving condition and lies near to both addington long barrow and chestnuts long barrow on the western side of the river
three further surviving long barrows kit 's coty house the little kit 's coty house and the coffin stone are located on the medway 's eastern side
built out of earth and around fifty local sarsen megaliths the long barrow consisted of a sub @-@ rectangular earthen tumulus enclosed by kerb @-@ stones
within the eastern end of the tumulus was a stone chamber into which human remains were deposited on at least two separate occasions during the early neolithic
osteoarchaeological analysis of these remains has shown them to be those of at least seventeen individuals a mixture of men women children and adults
at least one of the bodies had been dismembered prior to burial potentially reflecting a funerary tradition of excarnation and secondary burial
as with other barrows coldrum has been interpreted as a tomb to house the remains of the dead perhaps as part of a belief system involving ancestor veneration although archaeologists have suggested that it may also have had further religious ritual and cultural connotations and uses
after the early neolithic the long barrow fell into a state of ruined dilapidation perhaps experiencing deliberate deposition in the late medieval period either by christian zealots or treasure hunters
local folklore grew up around the site associating it with the burial of a prince and the countless stones motif
the ruin attracted the interest of antiquarians in the <num> century while archaeological excavation took place in the early <num>
after limited reconstruction in <year> ownership was transferred to heritage charity the national trust
it is open without charge to visitors all year around
the monument lies in a rather isolated site north @-@ east of the nearby village of trottiscliffe about <num> metres from a prehistoric track known as the pilgrim 's way
the tomb can be reached along a pathway known as coldrum lane which is only accessible on foot
the nearest car park to coldrum lane can be found off of pinesfield lane in trottiscliffe
another nearby village is addington which is located one and a quarter miles away
beginning in the fifth millennium bce it saw a widespread change in lifestyle as the communities living in the british isles adopted agriculture as their primary form of subsistence abandoning the hunter @-@ gatherer lifestyle that had characterised the preceding mesolithic period
archaeologists have been unable to prove whether this adoption of farming was because of a new influx of migrants coming in from continental europe or because the indigenous mesolithic britons came to adopt the agricultural practices of continental societies
either way it certainly emerged through contact with continental europe probably as a result of centuries of interaction between mesolithic people living in south @-@ east britain and linear pottery culture lbk communities in north @-@ eastern france
the region of modern kent would have been a key area for the arrival of continental european settlers and visitors because of its position on the estuary of the river thames and its proximity to the continent
between <num> and <num> bce all of the british isles came to abandon its former mesolithic hunter @-@ gatherer lifestyle to be replaced by the new agricultural subsistence of the neolithic age
although a common material culture was shared throughout most of the british isles in this period there was great regional variation regarding the nature and distribution of settlement architectural styles and the use of natural resources
throughout most of britain there is little evidence of cereal or permanent dwellings from this period leading archaeologists to believe that the early neolithic economy on the island was largely pastoral relying on herding cattle with people living a nomadic or semi @-@ nomadic way of life
although witnessing some land clearance britain was largely forested in this period and it is unclear what level of deforestation the area of kent had experienced in the early neolithic widespread forest clearance only took place on the chalklands of south @-@ east britain in the late bronze age
environmental data from the area around the white horse stone supports the idea that the area was still largely forested in the early neolithic covered by a woodland of oak ash hazel alder and maloideae
these were tombs that held the physical remains of the dead and though sometimes constructed out of timber many were built using large stones now known as megaliths
individuals were rarely buried alone in the early neolithic instead being interned in collective burials with other members of their community
the construction of these collective burial monumental tombs both wooden and megalithic began in continental europe before being adopted in britain in the first half of the fourth millennium bce
the early neolithic people of britain placed far greater emphasis on the ritualised burial of the dead than their mesolithic forebears had done
many archaeologists have suggested that this is because early neolithic people adhered to an ancestor cult that venerated the spirits of the dead believing that they could intercede with the forces of nature for the benefit of their living descendants
archaeologist robin holgate stressed that rather than simply being tombs the medway megaliths were communal mouments fulfilling a social function for the communities who built and used them
thus it has furthermore been suggested that early neolithic people entered into the tombs – which doubled as temples or shrines – to perform rituals that would honour the dead and ask for their assistance
for this reason historian ronald hutton termed these monuments tomb @-@ shrines to reflect their dual purpose
in britain these tombs were typically located on prominent hills and slopes overlooking the surrounding landscape perhaps at the junction between different territories
archaeologist caroline malone noted that the tombs would have served as one of a variety of markers in the landscape that conveyed information on territory political allegiance ownership and ancestors
many archaeologists have subscribed to the idea that these tomb @-@ shrines served as territorial markers between different tribal groups although others have argued that such markers would be of little use to a nomadic herding society
instead it has been suggested that they represent markers along herding pathways
many archaeologists have suggested that the construction of such monuments reflects an attempt to stamp control and ownership over the land thus representing a change in mindset brought about by neolithicisation
others have suggested that these monuments were built on sites already deemed sacred by mesolithic hunter @-@ gatherers
archaeologists have differentiated these early neolithic tombs into a variety of different architectural styles each typically associated with a different region within the british isles
passage graves characterised by their narrow passage made of large stones and one or multiple burial chambers covered in earth or stone were predominantly located in northern britain and southern and central ireland
alternately across northern ireland and central britain long chambered mounds predominated while in the east and south @-@ east of britain earthen long barrows represented the dominant architectural trend
these earthen long barrows were typically constructed of timber because building stone was scarce in southern britain archaeologist aubrey burl argued that these timber tombs might have been even more eye @-@ catching than their stone counterparts perhaps consisting of towering carved poles flamboyantly painted but that evidence of such sculptures has not survived
the medway megaliths represent just one of these regional groups within the wider west european tradition of tomb building in this period
grouped along the river medway as it cuts through the north downs they constitute the most south @-@ easterly group of megalithic monuments in the british isles and the only megalithic group in eastern england
archaeologists brian philp and mike dutto deemed the medway megaliths to be some of the most interesting and well known archaeological sites in kent while archaeologist paul ashbee described them as the most grandiose and impressive structures of their kind in southern england
they can be divided into two separate clusters one to the west of the river medway and the other on blue bell hill to the east with the distance between the two clusters measuring at between <num> and <num> km
the western group includes coldrum long barrow addington long barrow and the chestnuts long barrow
the eastern group consists of kit 's coty house little kit 's coty house the coffin stone and several other stones which might have once been parts of chambered tombs
it is not known if they were all built at the same time or whether they were constructed in succession while similarly it is not known if they each served the same function or whether there was a hierarchy in their usage
the medway long barrows all conformed to the same general design plan and are all aligned on an east to west axis
each had a stone chamber at the eastern end of the mound and they each probably had a stone facade flanking the entrance
the chambers were constructed from sarsen a dense hard and durable stone that occurs naturally throughout kent having formed out of silicified sand from the eocene
early neolithic builders would have selected blocks from the local area and then transported them to the site of the monument to be erected
such common architectural features among these tomb @-@ shrines indicate a strong regional cohesion with no direct parallels elsewhere in the british isles
for instance they would have been taller than most other tomb @-@ shrines in britain with internal heights of up to <num> ft
nevertheless as with other regional groupings of early neolithic tomb @-@ shrines such as the cotswold @-@ severn group there are also various idiosyncrasies in the different monuments such as coldrum 's rectilinear shape the chestnut long barrow 's facade and the long thin mounds at addington and kit 's coty
this variation might have been caused by the tomb @-@ shrines being altered and adapted over the course of their use in this scenario the monuments would represent composite structures
it seems apparent that the people who built these monuments were influenced by pre @-@ existing tomb @-@ shrines that they were already aware of
whether those people had grown up locally or moved into the medway area from elsewhere is not known
based on a stylistic analysis of their architectural designs stuart piggott thought that they had originated in the area around the low countries while glyn daniel instead believed that the same evidence showed an influence from scandinavia
john h
evans instead suggested an origin in germany and ronald f
jessup thought that their origins could be seen in the cotswold @-@ severn megalithic group
ashbee noted that their close clustering in the same area was reminiscent of the megalithic tomb @-@ shrine traditions of continental northern europe and emphasised that the medway megaliths were a regional manifestation of a tradition widespread across early neolithic europe
he nevertheless stressed that a precise place of origin was impossible to indicate with the available evidence
as such the archaeologist paul ashbee asserted that the monument could be divided into three particular features the chamber the barrow and the sarsen stone surround
it is located on the edge of a large lynchet scarp although it is difficult to ascertain what views would have been possible from the monument at the time of construction due to a lack of information on how densely forested the vicinity was
however if the area was not highly wooded then <num> ° views of the surrounding landscape would have been possible
the monument 's axis points toward both the north downs and the medway valley which is similar to the other medway megaliths
archaeologist sian killick suggested that the coldrum long barrow might have been built within view of a nearby settlement and that this may have been a key factor in the experience of ceremonies and rituals taking place at the tombs and may also have defined a link between the tomb builders and the landscape
it had been built using about <num> stones
the barrow is sub @-@ rectangular in plan and about <num> meters <num> feet in length
at its broader eastern end where the chamber is located the monument measures <num> metres <num> feet while at the narrower western end it is <num> metres <num> feet in breadth
as such the barrow is a truncated wedge @-@ shape
the megalithic builders responsible for the coldrum stones positioned it on the top of a small ridge adjacent to the north downs and constructed it facing eastward towards the river medway
the chamber of the monument measures <num>
<num> metres <num> feet in length and <num>
<num> metres <num> feet <num> inches in width although it was potentially much larger when originally constructed
the chamber 's internal height would have been at least <num> metres <num> feet <num> inches
in its current state the northern side of the chamber is made up of two slabs one being <num> feet long <num> feet <num> inches deep and <num> foot <num> inches thick and the other <num> feet long <num> feet deep and <num> feet thick
conversely the chamber 's southern side consists of a single slab measuring <num> feet <num> inches in length <num> feet <num> inches in depth and <num> foot <num> inches in depth at its thicker eastern end
the western end of the chamber is closed off with a slab measuring about <num> feet <num> inches wide with a thickness of <num> foot and a depth of around <num> feet
a collapsed broken slab lies at the opening eastern end of the chamber
it is also possible that a largely rectangular slab at the bottom of the slope had once been part of the eastern end of the chamber
excavation has revealed that flint masonry was used to pack around the chamber and support its sarsens twentieth @-@ century renovation has seen this largely replaced with cement allowing the stones to continue standing upright
it is possible that there was a facade in front of the chamber as is evident at other chambered tombs in britain such as west kennet long barrow and wayland 's smithy
it is also possible that there was a portal stone atop the chamber as was apparent at kit 's coty house and lower kit 's coty house
many of the larger slabs of stone that have fallen down the slope on the eastern end of the monument may have been parts of this facade or portal
the earthen mound that once covered the tomb is now visible only as an undulation approximately <num> foot <num> inches in height
in the nineteenth @-@ century the mound was higher on the western end of the tomb although this was removed by excavation to reveal the sarsens beneath during the <num>
it is likely that in the early neolithic the mound had a quarry ditch surrounding it and it is inside this ditch that the kerb @-@ stones now sit
the kerb @-@ stones around the tomb display some patterning those on the northern side are mostly rectilinear while those on the southern side are smaller and largely irregular in shape
it is probable that there was an ancillary dry @-@ stone wall constructed using blocks of ironstone from the geological folkestone beds as is evident at chestnuts long barrow
given that such blocks of stone rarely occur naturally it may have been quarried
a concave line of abrasion and polishing can be found on both one of the central kerb @-@ stones on the western end of the monument and a kerb @-@ stone on the south @-@ east of the monument
these have been attributed to the sharpening of flint and other stone axe @-@ blades on these sarsens
it is possible that these tools were sharpened for use in cutting and carving the timber levers and struts which would have been used in erecting the stones and constructing the tomb
similar evidence for the sharpening of tools has been found at west kennet long barrow as well as later prehistoric monuments such as stonehenge
coldrum long barrow is comparatively isolated from the other medway megaliths in this it is unique given that the other surviving examples are clustered into two groups
however it is possible that another chambered tomb was located nearby a razed elongated earthen mound with an east @-@ west orientation is located in a hollow at the foot of the downs just under a quarter of a mile to the north of the coldrum stones
it may be that this represents the remnants of another such monument which has had its stones removed or buried
several large sarsens to the south of the coldrums might represent the remnants of a further such tomb since destroyed
excavations conducted in the early <num> century have led to the methodical discovery and removal of what was believed to be the remains of twenty @-@ two human individuals
these remains were examined by sir arthur keith the conservator of the museum at the royal college of surgeons
he published his results in <year> in a paper largely concerned with discerning racial characteristics of the bodies
a subsequent re @-@ analysis of the bones was conducted in the early 21st century and published in the proceedings of the prehistoric society in <year> the project presented osteological analysis bayesian modelling of radiocarbon dates and carbon and nitrogen stable isotope analysis to inform on the demography burial practices diet and subsistence and chronology of the coldrum population
disputing earlier conclusions it stated that the minimum number of individuals was seventeen
these were then further identified as probably belonging to nine adults probably five males and four females two sub @-@ adults four older children and two younger children one around five years old the other between <num> and <num> months old
keith had suggested that the crania he examined displayed similar features which he attributed to the different individuals belonging to one family or several families united by common descent
similar observations had been made regarding the crania from other long barrows in britain although osteoarchaeologists martin smith and megan brickley noted that this was not necessarily representative of a family group
instead they stated that it would also be consistent with a population that was still relatively small and scattered in which most individuals were interrelated
wysocki 's team noted that in all but one case the fracture morphologies are consistent with dry @-@ bone breakage
three of the skulls exhibited evidence that they had experienced violence a probable adult female had an unhealed injury on the left frontal while an adult of indeterminate sex had an unhealed fracture on the left frontal and a second adult female had a healed depressed fracture on the right frontal
isotope analysis of the remains revealed δ13c values that were typical of those found at many other southern british neolithic sites albeit with significantly higher values of δ15c which grew over time
although this data is difficult to interpret it was identified as probably reflecting a terrestrial diet high in animal protein that over time was increasingly supplemented with freshwater river or estuarine foods
in the case of the older individuals whose remains were interned in the tomb the tooth enamel was worn away and the dentine had become exposed on the chewing area of the crowns
radiocarbon dating of the remains suggested early neolithic activity began at the site during <num> – <num> calibrated bce <num> probability or <num> – <num> cal bce <num> probability when the first human remains were buried at the site
it then suggested that after an interval of either <num> – <num> years <num> probability or <num> – <num> years <num> probability further depositions of human remains were made inside the tomb
this second phase probably began in <num> – <num> cal bce <num> probability or <num> – <num> cal bce <num> probability
the radiocarbon dating of the human remains does not provide a date for the construction of coldrum long barrow itself it is possible that the individuals died either some time before or after the monument 's construction
however they further suggested that the lack of such cut @-@ marks on certain bones was suggestive that the body had already undergone partial decomposition or the removal of soft tissues prior to the process of dismemberment
the precision of the cut @-@ marks suggests that this dismemberment was done carefully they do not suggest frenzied hacking or mutilation
none of the criteria that osteoarchaeologists deem diagnostic of cannibalism were found on the bones
this cut @-@ marked human bone assemblage represented the largest yet identified from within a neolithic long barrow in southern britain although similar evidence for dismemberment has been found from a number of other neolithic british sites such as west trump eyford aldestrop and haddenham
there are two possibilities for how this material developed
the first is that the bodies of the dead were excarnated or exposed to the elements followed by a secondary burial within the tomb
the second is that they were placed in the tomb where the flesh decomposed before the bodies were then rearranged within the tomb itself
these practices may have been accompanied by necrophagy shamanism or magical practices direct evidence for which does not survive
the inclusion of occupational debris over the bones was not unique to the site but common in chambered tombs from southern england
on the basis of an example discovered at kit 's coty house ashbee thought it apparent that the contents of the coldrum 's chamber would have been compartmentalised by medial slabs which served the same purpose as the side chambers of west kennet and wayland 's smithy
although archaeologist paul ashbee noted that the coldrum stones represent kent 's least damaged megalithic long barrow it too has suffered considerable damage having become dilapidated and fallen apart over the six millennia since its original construction
most prominently the eastern side has largely collapsed with the stones that once helped to hold up the side of the barrow having fallen to the bottom of the slope
conversely it is possible that the sarsens at the bottom of the slope were not part of the original monument but were stones found in nearby fields which were deposited there by farmers
excavation of chestnuts long barrow revealed that it had been systematically destroyed in one event and ashbee suggested that the same may have happened to the coldrum stones
he believed that the kerb @-@ stones around the barrow were toppled laid prostrate in the surrounding ditch and then buried during the late thirteenth or early fourteenth century by christians seeking to obliterate non @-@ christian monuments
conversely the archaeologist john alexander — who excavated chestnuts — suggested that the medway tombs were destroyed by robbers seeking to locate treasure within them
as evidence he pointed to the close roll of <num> which ordered the opening of barrows on the isle of wight in search for treasure a practice which may have spread to kent around the same time
alexander believed that the destruction n kent may have been brought about by a special commissioner highlighting that the expertness and thoroughness of the robbery at chestnuts would have necessitated resources beyond that which a local community could likely produce
ashbee further suggested that in subsequent centuries locals raided the damaged coldrum tomb for loamy chalk and stone which was then re @-@ used as building material
evans recorded the existence of a local folk belief that a battle was fought at the site of the coldrum stones and that a black prince was buried within its chamber
he suggested that the tales of battles taking place at this site and at other medway megaliths had not developed independently among the local population but had percolated down from the theories of antiquaries who believed that the early medieval battle of aylesford which was recorded in the anglo @-@ saxon chronicle took place in the area
evans also recorded that there was a folk belief in the area that applied to all of the medway megaliths and which had been widespread up to the last generation this was that it was impossible for any human being to successfully count the number of stones in the monuments
this countless stones motif is not unique to this particular site and can be found at various other megalithic monuments in britain
the earliest textual evidence for it is found in an early sixteenth @-@ century document where it applies to the stone circle of stonehenge in wiltshire although in an early seventeenth @-@ century document it was being applied to the hurlers a set of three stone circles in cornwall
later records reveal that it had gained widespread distribution in england as well as a single occurrence each in wales and ireland
the folklorist s
p
menefee suggested that it could be attributed to an animistic understanding that these megaliths had lives of their own
in the early twenty @-@ first century a tradition developed in which the hartley morris men a morris dancing side travel to the site at dawn every may day in order to sing up the sun
this consists of a number of dances performed within the stones on top of the barrow followed by a song performed at the base of the monument
there are claims that at the start of the nineteenth century the reverend mark noble rector of barming prepared a plan of the site for gentleman 's magazine although no copies have been produced to verify this
between <year> and <year> the reverend beale post authored druidical remains at coldrum in which he described the monument although it remained unpublished at the time
associating the site with the druids of britain 's iron age post 's suggestion was that the name coldrum derived from the linguistically celtic gael @-@ dun and that the chiefs of some of the belgic gauls were interned there
he further reported that in both <year> and <year> skulls had been found at the site
in <year> an antiquarian named thomas wright published a note on the coldrum stones and other medway megaliths in the archaeological journal
wright had been alerted to their existence by a local vicar the reverend lambert b
larking and proceeded to visit them with him
describing the coldrums wright mentioned a smaller circle of stones to the others in the area with a subterranean cromlech in the middle
he further added that it is a tradition of the peasantry that a continuous line of stones ran from coldrum direct to the well @-@ known monument called kit 's cotty sic house attributing this belief to the variety of megaliths which were scattered throughout the landscape
in <year> the antiquarian j
m
kemble excavated at the site with the help of the reverend larking providing a report of their findings to the central committee of the british archaeological association
describing the monument as a stone circle they asserted that they discovered anglo @-@ saxon pottery at the site and noted that as well as being called the coldrum stones the monument also had the name of the adscombe stones which kemble believed originated with the old english word for funeral pile ad
in august <year> the archaeological institute who were then holding their week @-@ long meeting in rochester took a tour to visit the site guided by the antiquary charles roach smith
that year the monument was described in a copy of gentleman 's magazine by yorkshire antiquary charles moore jessop who believed it to be a celtic stone circle
in <year> the antiquarian a
l
lewis first visited the site and was informed by locals that several years previously a skull had been uncovered from inside or near to the chamber but that they believed it to be that of a gypsy
a later account elaborated on this stating that two individuals excavated in the centre of the dolmen without permission discovering a human skeleton the skull of which was then re @-@ buried in the churchyard at meopham
in an <year> note published in the journal of the anthropological institute of great britain and ireland lewis noted that while many tourists visited kit 's coty house very few goes to or ever hears of a yet more curious collection of stones at colderham or coldrum lodge
he believed that the monument consisted of both a chamber and an oval of stones suggesting that they were two distinct erections
in <year> the archaeologist flinders petrie included the existence of the stones at coldreham in his list of kentish earthworks although noting that a previous commentator had described the stones as being in the shape of an oval he instead described them as forming a rectilinear enclosure around the chamber
he then included a small basic plan of the monument
in august <year> two amateur archaeologists george payne and a
a
arnold came across the monument which they noted was known among locals as the coldrum stones and druid temple according to payne the huge stones were so overgrown with brambles and brushwood that they could not be discerned
he returned the next year noting that at this point the brushwood had been cut away to reveal the megaliths
in his <year> book collectanea cantiana payne noted that although it had first been described in print in <year> since that time no one seems to have taken the trouble to properly record them or make a plan an unusual claim given that a copy of petrie 's published plan existed in his library
for this reason after gaining permission from the landowner he convinced major a
o
green instructor in survey at brompton to conduct a survey of the monument in august <year>
he also wrote to the archaeologist augustus pitt @-@ rivers encouraging him to schedule the coldrum stones as a legally protected site under the ancient monuments protection act <year>
payne described the coldrum stones as the finest monument of its class in the county and one worthy of every care and attention
comparing it to other monuments of its type in britain he asserted that it was undoubtedly of sepulchral origin belonging to a period anterior to the roman domination of britain
payne also noted a folk tradition that there were stone avenues connecting coldrum to the addington long barrow although added that he was unable to discover any evidence for the existence of this feature
in <year> george clinch published a note on the medway megaliths in the royal anthropological institute 's journal man in which he referred to the coldrum stones as at once the most remarkable and the least known of the whole series
suggesting that its design indicates that it was built during a late date in the neolithic age he compared the workmanship in producing the megaliths to that at the stone circle of stonehenge in wiltshire although noted that they differed in that the coldrum stones clearly represented a sepulchral pile
ultimately he ended his note by urging for the site to be protected under the ancient monuments protection act <year>
in that same issue lewis included an added note in which he rejected the idea that the monument had once been covered by an earthen tumulus because he could see no evidence that anything of that kind ever existed and instead he interpreted the site as a stone circle comparing it to the examples at avebury arborlow and stanton drew suggesting that the central chamber was a shrine
on <num> april <year> the amateur archaeologist f
j
bennett began excavation at the site after previously having uncovered some neolithic lithics from addington long barrow
he soon discovered human bones under only a few inches of chalky soil
he returned to the site for further excavation in august <year> this time with his niece and her husband both of whom were dentists with an interest in craniology on that day they discovered pieces of a human skull which they were able to largely reconstruct
a few days later he returned to excavate on the north @-@ west corner of the dolmen with the architect e
w
filkins that day they found a second skull further bones a flint tool and pieces of pottery
later that month george payne and f
w
reader met with bennett to discuss his finds
with the aid of two other interested amateur archaeologists mr boyd and miss harker both from malling excavation resumed in early september
in <year> the archaeologists martin smith and megan brickley asserted that bennett 's excavations had taken heed of the advice of pitt @-@ rivers that excavations should be recorded in full
they noted that bennett had provided clear plan and section drawings photographs of the monument and careful attempts to consider site formation processes
suggesting that the monument was constructed on agricultural land in his published report bennett cited the ideas of anthropologist james frazer in the golden bough to suggest that the coldrum stones monument may at one time have been dedicated though not necessarily initially so to the worship of the corn god and of agriculture
he proceeded to theorise that the human remains found at the site were the victims of human sacrifice killed in fertility rites
however evans later stated that we have no means of knowing whether human sacrifice had taken place at the site
in september <year> filkins once again began excavating at the site this time with the aid of a resident of gravesend charles gilbert
their project was financed through grants provided by the british association and the society of antiquaries with filkins noting that at the time of its commencement a miniature jungle had grown up around the site which had to be cleared
excavation continued sporadically until at least <year>
human remains were discovered and placed into the possession of sir arthur keith of the royal college of surgeons
this excavation revealed all the existing sarsens surrounding the monument a number of which had previously been buried beneath earth
the stones of the dolmen were shored up with concrete foundations where filkins deemed it necessary
although filkins excavation was comprehensive it did ignore stone holes packing stones and their relationship to the mound
in <year> ashbee noted that while from a present @-@ day perspective it is possible to see shortcomings
in terms of the general standards of the early part of this century there is much to commend

crawford then working as the archaeological officer for the ordnance survey listed the coldrum stones alongside the other medway megaliths
in <year> the coldrum stones were given to the national trust who dedicated it as a memorial to the kentish historian benjamin harrison
a plaque was erected to mark this which erroneously termed the monument a stone circle in <year> the archaeologist leslie grinsell expressed the view that it is hoped that this error may be rectified in the near future
still owned by the trust the site is open to visitors all year round free of charge
on their website the trust advises visitors to look for stunning views from the top of the barrow
john h
evans characterised the site as the most impressive of the medway megaliths while grinsell described it as the finest and most complete of the group
her design was heavily modified by the soviets and she was completed in <year>
during world war ii she supported soviet troops during the siege of odessa siege of sevastopol and the kerch @-@ feodosiya operation in the winter of <year> — <num>
she was awarded the guards title on <num> april <year>
she was reclassified as a training ship in may <year> before being used as a target in <year>
construction was abandoned in <year> during the october revolution when the ship was <num> complete
in the second half of <year> the marine department of hetman pavlo skoropadskyi was engaged in completion of ship
on <num> january <year> the ship was formally renamed in hetman petro doroshenko but mykolaiv was captured shortly afterward by the entente
the hull was relatively undamaged and the soviets decided to finish the ship to a modified design
she was renamed krasnyi kavkaz on <num> december <year> and completed to a modernized design being commissioned on <num> january <year>
krasnyi kavkaz was initially intended to accommodate eight <num> @-@ inch <num> mm guns in four twin turrets but this was impossible given her small and lightly constructed hull
three twin turrets mounting the new <num> @-@ caliber <num> mm <num>
<num> in b @-@ <num> @-@ k gun under development also proved impracticable and the soviets had to settle for four mk @-@ <num> @-@ <num> single <num> mm gun turrets two at each end
her superstructure was massively revised to fit these turrets and all of the original casemated <num> @-@ millimeter <num>
<num> in <num> b7 pattern <year> guns were removed
as completed her secondary armament was only four <num> @-@ caliber <num>
<num> mm lender aa guns mounted between her funnels
her original internal torpedo tubes were replaced by four triple <num> @-@ millimetre <num>
<num> in torpedo mounts mounted on each side of the main deck abaft the forecastle break
she was given an aircraft @-@ handling crane but a catapult wasn 't installed aft of her rear funnel until <year> when a heinkel catapult was imported from germany
she was also fitted for mine rails with a capacity of up to <num> mines
the light cruiser komintern collided with her in may <year> shortly after her commissioning and badly damaged her bow
it was extensively rebuilt and increased her overall length by over <num> metres <num> ft
in <year> she made port visits in turkey greece and italy
she was refitted before operation barbarossa probably about <year> her catapult was removed and her anti @-@ aircraft armament was greatly increased
her four <num>
<num> mm lender aa guns were exchanged for four italian minizini twin gun <num> @-@ caliber <num> mm <num>
<num> in aa mounts and she received four single mounts for the semi @-@ automatic <num>
<num> mm <num> @-@ k were fitted as well as six <num>
<num> mm <num>
<num> in aa machine guns
two single mounts for <num>
<num> mm <num>
<num> in <num> @-@ k guns were also fitted one on each side of the quarterdeck just aft of the rearmost main gun turret
some of these guns may have been received earlier the sources are unclear
while under repair at poti in late <year> she landed her aft pair of torpedo tubes and received two more minizini mounts salvaged from the sunken cruiser chervona ukraina
ten single mounts for the naval version of the <num> mm aa gun was also fitted
by <year> she was also carrying one quadruple vickers
<num> machine gun mk iii mount on top of each of her superfiring main gun turrets and she may have been using oerlikon <num> mm cannon
she provided gunfire support to soviet forces defending odessa and escorted convoys bringing the <num> rifle division into odessa during the month of september <year>
she also transported one battalion of the <num> marine regiment from sevastopol in a successful amphibious assault behind romanian lines to destroy romanian coastal batteries near fontanka and dofinovka
she escorted convoys from <num> — <num> october that evacuated the <num> rifle division from odessa to sevastopol and escorted the final evacuation convoy during the night of <num> – <num> october
during the siege of sevastopol she provided gunfire support and evacuated cut @-@ off troops from elsewhere in the crimea into sevastopol and brought in reinforcements from caucasian ports
she helped to transport the <num> rifle division from novorossiysk and tuapse to sevastopol between <num> and <num> december and the <num> rifle division between <num> and <num> december bombarding german positions in the interim
during the kerch @-@ feodosiya operation krasnyi kavkaz sailed into the harbor of feodosiya on <num> december <year> and disembarked reinforcements and provided gunfire support for soviet troops already ashore
she was hit seventeen times by axis artillery and mortar fire in retaliation
on <num> and <num> january she ferried supplies and reinforcements for the soviet bridgehead on the kerch peninsula
on the return voyage she was severely damaged by german junkers ju <num> stuka dive @-@ bombers from ii
stg <num>
four near @-@ misses close to her stern damaged her steering her left propeller shaft blew off one propeller and put enough holes in her stern that flooding caused her draft to increase by <num> metres <num> ft
she made it to novorossiysk escorted by the destroyer sposobnyi where she was patched up enough to make to poti where more permanent repairs could be made
these took until october <year> and the opportunity was taken to reinforce her anti @-@ aircraft armament
she was awarded the guards title on <num> april in recognition of her performance
between <num> and <num> october krasnyi kavkaz her half @-@ sister krasnyi krym and three destroyers ferried <num> @,@ <num> men of the <num> <num> and <num> guards rifle brigades from poti to tuapse to reinforce the defenses there
on the night of <num> february <year> the soviets made a series of amphibious landings to the west of novorossiysk behind german lines
krasnyi krym krasnyi kavkaz and three destroyers provided fire support for the main landing but the soviet troops there were wiped out by <num> february although one secondary landing was successful
the loss of three destroyers attempting to interdict the german evacuation of the taman bridgehead on <num> october <year> caused stalin to forbid the deployment of large naval units without his express permission and this meant the end of krasnyi kavkaz 's active participation in the war
she was sunk as a target ship by ss @-@ n @-@ <num> missiles on <num> november <year>
<num> @-@ mile <num>
<num> km long numbered state highway located in washington county and southern kent county rhode island united states
the route is a major north – south freeway in the southern providence metropolitan area directly linking providence with eastern washington county the beaches of narragansett and south kingstown and the city of newport
route <num> begins as a two @-@ lane divided highway at an intersection with u
s
route <num> us <num> in the town of north kingstown becoming a limited @-@ access freeway after <num>
<num> miles <num>
<num> km
the route has four numbered interchanges before terminating in the city of warwick where the northbound lanes merge into interstate <num> i @-@ <num>
the origins of route <num> date back to <year> when construction began on a short unnumbered arterial from us <num> to the modern location of exit <num> at routes <num> and <num> in wickford
in <year> the rhode island department of public works began work on a <num>
<num> @-@ mile <num>
<num> km freeway from modern exit <num> north to the merge with i @-@ <num>
the freeway designated as route <num> was completed in <year>
at that time the route <num> designation was also applied to the wickford arterial
in <year> the missing link in route <num> between exits <num> and <num> was completed and opened
the rhode island department of transportation has long @-@ term plans to upgrade the southernmost portion of route <num> to freeway status by constructing overpasses at oak hill road and west allenton road and a grade separation with us <num>
although the project was originally scheduled to be completed by <year> the <num> million project has been postponed indefinitely
s
route <num> in the community of north kingstown the two left lanes of us <num> default onto route <num> north with the right @-@ hand lane carrying tower hill road and us <num> north into the village of wickford
route <num> heads in a northwestern direction as a four @-@ lane divided highway crossing west allenton road at an at @-@ grade intersection with a traffic signal after approximately <num>
<num> miles <num>
<num> km
the highway continues on a northwesterly projection passing to the northeast of kettle hole pond and to the southwest of secret lake in a heavily forested region
after secret lake the highway curves to the north crossing oak hill road at another at @-@ grade intersection
shortly after the intersection with oak hill road route <num> transitions from a divided arterial highway into a four @-@ lane limited @-@ access freeway
the freeway passes to the west of belleville pond and begins to parallel the alignment of route <num> ten rod road near the community of lafayette
route <num> passes over amtrak 's northeast corridor railroad before entering the business district of wickford junction
the freeway interchanges with routes <num> and <num> at exit <num> a partial cloverleaf interchange
after the interchange route <num> bends to the northeast beginning a parallel alignment with route <num> that continues to its northern terminus
route <num> crosses into the town of east greenwich passing under south road before interchanging with route <num> at exit <num> a partial cloverleaf interchange
after exit <num> route <num> passes the rhode island army national guard base to the east and to the hunt river to the west
route <num> northbound interchanges with route <num> at exit <num> route <num> or the quonset freeway is a four @-@ lane limited access freeway and spur route of route <num> that serves the quonset business park and the village of davisville

after exit <num> route <num> continues northward as a six @-@ lane expressway passing farmlands to the west and entering a suburban region of east greenwich
the highway crosses under an overpass at middle road before interchanging with route <num> the freeway 's final spur at another partial cloverleaf interchange
exit <num> is also used to access route <num> and i @-@ <num> south which has no direct freeway connection with route <num> north

route <num> in wickford
construction on the highway began in <year> and was completed in <year> at which time the roadway opened as an unnumbered state highway leading from us <num> to routes <num> and <num> in wickford
during the late <num> a few years after the completion of the arterial the rhode island department of public works ridpw proposed a relocation of route <num> which at the time was the major thoroughfare in the area
no action was taken until <year> when the ridpw introduced a study for the relocated route <num> proposal
during the study drivers who used the colonel rodman highway arterial and were bound for the state capital of providence were redirected onto route <num> an accident @-@ prone four @-@ lane undivided highway near the modern exit <num>
in <year> the planned route <num> freeway was given the new number of route <num> leaving route <num> on its existing alignment
a public hearing was held by the state of rhode island on the proposed freeway which was to be four lanes and have a divided grassy median
this proposal was later accepted and construction began two years later
construction of a <num>
<num> @-@ mile <num>
<num> km long section of route <num> from what is now exit <num> in east greenwich to i @-@ <num> in warwick began in <year> and was completed in <year>
that year the <num> @-@ mile <num>
<num> km arterial south of the modern exit <num> was also designated as part of route <num>
the divided highway remains largely intact to this date as the stretch of route <num> from us <num> to routes <num> and <num> at exit <num> the only piece of the arterial that has been significantly altered is the construction of a bridge over amtrak 's northeast corridor line
by the early <num> route <num> was complete north of exit <num> and south of what would become exit <num> but there was a still a missing piece in the highway between the two exits
in the <num> the state of rhode island faced several budget problems and environmental concerns both of which delayed the construction of the missing link for nearly eleven years
environmental studies on the missing link began in <year> and the state estimated that the <num>
<num> @-@ mile <num>
<num> km long section of freeway would cost <num> – <num> million equivalent to <num> – <num> million in <year> to construct
in <year> the rhode island department of transportation ridot began construction of the new segment of route <num> between exits <num> and <num>
the project which ultimately went over budget at <num> million equivalent to <num> million in <year> was financed from a <num> million federal grant
in <year> during excavation for the new right @-@ of @-@ way the department of transportation found archeological items from the narragansett indians dating from about <num> @,@ <num> to <num> @,@ <num> years prior
although the findings were not centralized in the area this caused delays for the extension of the freeway
on august <num> <year> riodt completed construction and performed a ribbon @-@ cutting ceremony for the new highway
in january <year> two police cruisers were severely damaged during a chase on route <num>
a driver was speeding in the southbound lanes of route <num> near exit <num> when the driver exited at route <num> frenchtown road two police officers got into serious accidents in their attempts to pursue the vehicle
after the crashes the american civil liberties union restarted efforts to amend police chase policy and avoid further crash @-@ related injuries for officers in the line of duty
in <year> construction began on the quonset freeway a relocated route <num> that serves the quonset business park from route <num>
the project included the reconstruction and reworking of exit <num> off route <num> which was a southbound @-@ only exit serving both route <num> and route <num> when constructed
the exit was converted into a trumpet interchange with new ramps between route <num> route <num> and route <num> and was completed in december <year> one year ahead of schedule
the project included the construction of a new northbound exit <num> serving route <num> east
during the <num> and <num> ridot announced plans to eliminate the three traffic lights along the southern end of the highway
the department planned to replace the existing signalized us <num> and route <num> merge converting it into a grade @-@ separated interchange with an extensive overpass
this would cut @-@ off access to three local roads that intersect us <num> near the signal
the plan also included the replacement of the two other signaled intersections at west allenton road and oak hill road with overpasses the overpass for west allenton road is planned to be constructed as a new exit <num>
in the <num> the state purchased and demolished several houses in the region to allow for an expanded route <num> right @-@ of @-@ way in the vicinity of west allenton road
the upgrade proposal proved to be very unpopular with north kingstown residents who lived on the affected local roads
additionally ridot laid the highway out so that route <num> would cross through wetlands in the area
this sparked environmental concerns as one of the large wetlands that would be affected froberg 's marsh was deemed to be of high value by rhode island environmentalists
despite local and environmental concerns ridot still considers the route <num> upgrade to be the safest way to improve traffic flow in the region
while the department of transportation considered upgrading nearby route <num> to freeway standards as a potential alternative this plan was ultimately rejected because of its effects on wells in the area
although the project was originally scheduled to be completed by <year> the <num> million project has been postponed indefinitely
ridot also has long @-@ range plans to construct direct freeway connections linking route <num> north with i @-@ <num> south and i @-@ <num> north with route <num> south
as of november <year> environmental studies are being prepared for a reconfiguration of the interchange
written by neil tennant and chris lowe the song was released twice as a single
the song is influenced by hip hop music with lyrics concerned with class and the pressures of inner @-@ city life which were inspired partly by t
s
eliot 's poem the waste land
it was generally well received by contemporary music critics and has been frequently cited as a highlight in the duo 's career
the first version of the song was produced by bobby orlando and was released on columbia records bobcat records imprint in april <year> becoming a club hit in the united states and some european countries
after the duo signed with emi the song was re @-@ recorded with producer stephen hague for their first studio album please
in october <year> the new version was released reaching number one in the united kingdom and the united states in <year>
in <year> the song won best single at the brit awards and best international hit at the ivor novello awards

orlando played most of the instruments on west end girls including the jazz riff at the end
lowe played one chord and the bassline
it included a drum part lifted from michael jackson 's billie jean and an arrangement involving what tennant called barry white chords
orlando was thrilled by the song 's production his idea was to make a rap record in a british accent
in april <year> west end girls was released becoming a club hit in los angeles and san francisco and a minor dance hit in belgium and france but was only available in the united kingdom as a <num> import
in march <year> after long negotiations pet shop boys cut their contractual ties with orlando and hired manager tom watkins who signed them with emi

s
in an interview on bbc4 's synth britannia programme video on youtube at 1h <num> <num> neil tennant explains the role of the then new sampling technology on the track and how every single sound came from the newly introduced e @-@ mu emulator keyboard
the song 's socially conscious streak as well as the propulsive bass line derives from grandmaster flash 's protest rap song the message
lowe and hague created a snaky obsessive rhythm punch for the music replacing the song 's previously sparse beats and minimal keyboard lines
tennant started to write the song when he was staying at his cousin 's house in nottingham while watching a gangster film
just when he was going to sleep he came up with the lines sometimes you 're better off dead there 's a gun in your hand and it 's pointing at your head
the lyrics were inspired by t
s
eliot 's poem the waste land particularly in the use of different narrative voices and arcane references
the song 's lyrics are largely concerned with class inner @-@ city pressure
tennant later said that some listeners had assumed the song referred to prostitutes but was actually about rough boys getting a bit of posh
the lyric from lake geneva to the finland station refers to the train route taken by vladimir lenin when he was smuggled by the germans to russia during world war i a pivotal event in the russian revolution
indeed it is highly likely the lyric was inspired by the book to the finland station by edmund wilson a very famous work on the history of revolutionary thought and socialism that tennant would have at least heard of if not read as a student
the bobby orlando @-@ produced version of the single included another line all your stopping stalling and starting who do you think you are joe stalin which was removed for the <year> version
stephen thomas erlewine from allmusic in a review of the album please called the song hypnotic adding that it 's not only a classic dance single it 's a classic pop single
in a review for the group 's second studio album actually rob hoerburger from rolling stone magazine commented that west end girls was as catchy as anything on the radio in <year> praising its enticing bass line and foreboding synth riffs but felt that it was almost nullified by peevish spoken asides and the cryptic posturing of the duo 's lyrics
in a review of the live album concrete michael hubbard from musicomh said that west end girls was one of the songs that round out a collection that never feels too long or superfluous adding that it goes some way to installing tennant and lowe as national treasures
nitsuh abebe from pitchfork media in a review of their compilation album popart pet shop boys the hits commented that in the song we meet tennant not as a singer but as a speaker adding that he mumbles the verses to us not like a star but like a stranger in a raincoat slinking alongside you and pointing out the sights
in <year> west end girls won for best single at the brit awards and for best international hit at the ivor novello awards
in <year> the british academy of composers and songwriters gave to west end girls the ivor novello award for song of the decade between the years <year> and <year>
at the beginning of the video noises from the city can be heard a camera passes lowe on the street and focus on two vintage dolls in a shop window

<num>
produced by greg kurstin it is her first christmas album and her first record to be solely released by rca
wrapped in red consists of sixteen tracks featuring five co @-@ penned original songs and eleven cover versions of christmas standards and carols two of which are duets featuring recording artists ronnie dunn reba mcentire and trisha yearwood
weary of constantly being asked for her primary genre clarkson had long @-@ desired to record a christmas album as a means to defy genre limitations
she commissioned kurstin who had studied jazz music under the tutelage of jaki byard to produce the entire album
drawing inspirations from the soundtracks to the features a charlie brown christmas and white christmas as well as the christmas albums by mariah carey mcentire and phil spector they experimented on various styles and sounds using spector 's famed wall of sound technique to a create a contemporary holiday theme to classics
the christmas music of wrapped in red comprises a variety of the genres such pop jazz country and soul marking a departure from the pop rock sound established from her previous studio albums while its lyrics share a singular theme of the color red which represents a plethora of emotions during the holidays
wrapped in red debuted on the billboard <num> chart at number <num> and topped the billboard top holiday albums chart with <num> @,@ <num> copies sold in its first week of release
for nine consecutive weeks wrapped in red stayed on the top ten of both charts and was certified platinum by the recording industry association of america and music canada
by the end of <year> it became the year 's best @-@ selling christmas release in the united states and the second best @-@ selling christmas release in canada
its lead single underneath the tree became an international top forty christmas hit song and was radio 's most @-@ played new holiday song of <year>
in promoting wrapped in red she appeared in red dresses on various televised appearances and filmed an accompanying television special kelly clarkson 's cautionary christmas music tale at the venetian las vegas which premiered on nbc on december <num> <year>
in <year> clarkson released the title track as the second single and hosted an annual christmas benefit concert miracle on broadway at the bridgestone arena on december <num> <year>
weary of constantly being asked for her primary genre she felt that recording a christmas album would finally pave a way for her to explore other different genres
she remarked i always get asked what genre i 'm in is this country or pop or rock what are you and what 's cool about making the christmas album was oh there are no limitations we can do whatever we want
she further added the thing about christmas is that it almost doesn 't matter what mood you 're in or what kind of a year you 've had — it 's a fresh start
i 'm going to clear the air and take stock of the good that 's happened
discussions about making her sixth studio album being a christmas record began on december <year> a month after releasing her first greatest hits album greatest hits – chapter one
having found the opportunity to do so clarkson commissioned producer and multi @-@ instrumentalist greg kurstin whom she had previously collaborated with on her albums stronger and chapter one to solely produce the whole album
despite having been raised in a jewish faith and unfamiliar with christmas songs kurstin still agreed to produce the project
as a result the record marked the second time her studio album only had a single producer the first being david kahne solely producing my december in <year>
it also marked the fourth time kurstin had solely produced an entire studio album apart from being a member of the musical groups the bird and the bee and geggy tah the first three being lily allen 's it 's not me it 's you in <year> sia 's we are born in <year> and the shins port of morrow in <year>
in recording tracks for the album clarkson and kurstin wanted to showcase as many different styles as they could by experimenting in various sounds and styles to create fresh contemporary sound to classic @-@ sounding music
he recalled it was a lot of fun for us because we got to go back to our roots
when kelly started singing it was clear she had the chops and had been trained to do anything
further adding we really experimented
it was so much fun and liberating
and it pays off
kurstin who studied with jazz musician jaki byard at the new school for jazz and contemporary music recruited various jazz and soul musicians such as james gadson kevin dukes roy mccurdy and bill withers to perform on the record to resonate a memphis soul sound
he also collaborated with joseph trapanese to arrange and conduct a chamber orchestra
in providing instrumentation for the record kurstin used all of his instruments such as a mellotron and a chamberlin taping them from a distance to stimulate the wall of sound a recording technique originally developed by phil spector that was popular in the early <num>
he enlisted clarkson to provide all the background vocals herself
clarkson who grew up singing in a chorus was pleased with the aspect saying blending is something i knew how to do from childhood
sometimes i 'd have to do an alto instead of a soprano because they needed a bigger sound
but i 've never had to do anything like this before — doing all my backup vocals essentially being my own choir
together they began to record in may <year> and continued through the summer of that year beginning by recording white christmas with clarkson in the vocal booth and with kurstin on a piano
she commented the production is all him
i would be just like hey can we make this more jazz hey can we make this more bluesy
and he just like harry potter made this happen
it 's so weird
a color traditionally associated with christmas she affiliated the color to various emotions in the holidays
wanting to stray away from her usual pop sound she described wrapped in red 's music as a representation to explore different genres such as jazz country and memphis soul
she recalled what 's cool about christmas albums is you can do jazz rock and roll you can do pop you can do blues like you can do all that stuff and it works — cause it 's all classic and it 's christmasy sounding
she also noted that the album 's multitude of styles positively contributes to her artistic goal saying my best friend from childhood heard it and said this is what you sound like before everything else
and i agree it 's my core sound
back in the day when artists came out with things like fall to pieces and bridge over troubled water those songs transcended genres
it wasn 't where is it going to fit you catered to whatever the song calls for
and that 's exactly what i did — without having to have an umbrella for everything
in gathering inspirations for wrapped in red clarkson started by listening to bing crosby 's and rosemary clooney 's soundtracks from the <year> feature film white christmas as well as mariah carey 's merry christmas <year> and merry christmas to you <year> by reba mcentire
while kurstin who used to play in a jazz band took influences from a charlie brown christmas by the vince guaraldi trio and a christmas gift for you by phil spector as his inspirations which resulted to the album 's wall of sound resonance
clarkson also cited that her relationship with her then @-@ fiancé brandon blackstock had inspired some of the album 's lyrical content
she co @-@ wrote the opening and the title track wrapped in red with ashley arrison aben eubanks and shane mcanally
a christmas ballad the song was inspired by a scene in the holiday feature film love actually <year> in which someone confesses unrequited love towards another
critics singled out the track the one that resonates the wall of sound the most
the second track underneath the tree was written by clarkson and kurstin making it the first time they had co @-@ written a track together
clarkson remarked greg and i have worked a lot together but usually i just come in and i just sing
we 've never have actually written a song together at this point
and he and i were like let 's just try to write something for the record
rca records chief executive peter edge remarked that its release as a single was partly inspired by the success of all i want for christmas is you by carey
the following track is a rendition of the holiday standard have yourself a merry little christmas which clarkson had selected for its saccharine content
clarkson favored run run rudolph as her favorite classic saying just because it got to be a little more rock and roll
she also remarked that please come home for christmas bells will be ringing was the first song selected for inclusion after her mother 's recommendation and the song 's melancholic lyrics
written by clarkson and eubanks every christmas was the first song to be written for the album
she revealed that the song narrates of her holiday life prior to meeting blackstock mcentire 's stepson saying every christmas i was just like this is going to be different right i 'm going to actually find someone and not be pathetically alone for the rest of my life
the seventh track is a cover of elvis presley 's blue christmas
its follow @-@ up a rendition of baby it 's cold outside features ronnie dunn
clarkson had approached dunn thinking that his personality suited the song 's content well saying like it 's straight @-@ up his personality to say all of that to try and get you to stay and have a drink
winter dreams brandon 's song was written by clarkson arrison and eubanks as a companion piece to every christmas
dedicated to blackstock the song accounts her holiday after meeting him
she remarked christmas changes it morphs it comes to life a little more … it ’ s just a happier time
the tenth track white christmas was the first song to be recorded for wrapped in red
a cover of rodgers and hammerstein 's my favorite things follows up as the eleventh track
clarkson opted for the broadway performance of the song to stray away from julie andrews 's version citing i think you shouldn 't go near anywhere of what she 's doing because she 's so good
clarkson and kurstin co @-@ wrote <num> carats with cathy dennis and livvi franc
originally written a pop song they converted it as a christmas song to fit the album 's theme describing it as a crossover between eartha kitt 's santa baby <year> and madonna 's material girl <year>
a rendition of imogen heap 's just for now was described by clarkson as her highly dysfunctional environment saying can we just stop for like five minutes and have like a normal christmas setting the song begins by sampling the melody of the christmas tune carol of the bells
the closing track a rendition of the traditional carol silent night features mcentire and trisha yearwood and ends in an a capella setting between the trio

sal cinquemani of slant magazine also gave it a similar rating
he noted that the album largely offers a respite from the pop @-@ rock template she 's been relentlessly pursuing since breakaway with less shouting and more of the varied range and texture on full display that helped coronate her the winner of the inaugural season of american idol

reviewing for hitfix melinda newman gave the album an a rating praising clarkson 's vocal performances and noting that she and kurstin have clearly studied legendary christmas albums of yore — most notably spector 's a christmas gift for you and andy williams merry christmas — to lovingly recreate christmas standards as well as craft new ones in the image of those sets

it was ranked first in the british film institute 's <year> poll of top <num> indian films of all time
in <year> the judges of the <num> annual filmfare awards named it the best film of <num> years
the film was shot in the rocky terrain of ramanagara in the southern state of karnataka over a span of two and a half years

in <year> the original director 's cut of <num> minutes became available on home media
when first released sholay received negative critical reviews and a tepid commercial response but favourable word @-@ of @-@ mouth publicity helped it to become a box office success
it broke records for continuous showings in many theatres across india and ran for more than five years at mumbai 's minerva theatre
by some accounts sholay is the highest grossing indian film of all time adjusted for inflation
the film drew heavily from the conventions of westerns and is a defining example of the masala film which mixes several genres in one work
scholars have noted several themes in the film such as glorification of violence conformation to feudal ethos debate between social order and mobilised usurpers homosocial bonding and the film 's role as a national allegory
the combined sales of the original soundtrack scored by r
d
burman and the dialogues released separately set new sales records

in a tough battle veeru and jai are cornered
thakur although he has a gun within his reach does not help them
veeru and jai fight back and the bandits flee
the two are however upset at thakur 's inaction and consider leaving the village

he had concealed the dismemberment by always wearing a shawl
living in ramgarh the jovial veeru and cynical jai find themselves growing fond of the villagers
veeru is attracted to basanti hema malini a feisty talkative young woman who makes her living by driving a horse @-@ cart

sippy and ramesh sippy two other producer director teams had earlier rejected the idea
ramesh sippy liked the concept and hired them to develop it
the original idea of the film involved an army officer who decided to hire two ex @-@ soldiers to avenge the murder of his family
the army officer was later changed to a policeman because sippy felt that it would be difficult to get permission to shoot scenes depicting army activities
salim @-@ javed completed the script in one month incorporating names and personality traits of their friends and acquaintances
the film was loosely styled after akira kurosawa 's <year> film seven samurai and drew heavily from the conventions of westerns especially sergio leone 's spaghetti westerns such as once upon a time in the west <year> and john sturges film the magnificent seven <year>
sholay was also influenced by the westerns of sam peckinpah such as the wild bunch <year> and pat garrett and billy the kid <year> and by george roy hill 's butch cassidy and the sundance kid <year>
a scene depicting an attempted train robbery was inspired by a similar scene in north west frontier <year> and a scene showing the massacre of thakur 's family has been compared with the massacre of the mcbain family in once upon a time in the west
some plot elements were borrowed from the indian films mera gaon mera desh <year> and khote sikkay <year>
the character gabbar singh was modelled on a real @-@ life dacoit of the same name who had menaced the villages around gwalior in the <num>
any policeman captured by the real gabbar singh had his ears and nose cut off and was released as a warning to other policemen
the character was also influenced by the villain el indio played by gian maria volontè of sergio leone 's for a few dollars more <year>
soorma bhopali a minor comic relief character was based on an acquaintance of actor jagdeep a forest officer from bhopal named soorma
the real @-@ life soorma eventually threatened to press charges when people who had viewed the film began referring to him as a woodcutter
the main characters names jai and veeru mean victory and heroism in hindi
amjad khan who was the second choice prepared himself for the part by reading the book abhishapta chambal which told of the exploits of chambal dacoits
the book was written by taroon kumar bhaduri the father of fellow cast member jaya bhaduri
as cast members had read the script ahead of time many were interested in playing different parts
pran was considered for the role of thakur baldev singh but sippy thought sanjeev kumar was a better choice
initially dharmendra was also interested to play the role of thakur
he eventually gave up the role when sippy informed him that sanjeev kumar would play veeru if that happened and would be paired with hema malini who dharmendra was trying to woo
dharmendra knew that kumar was also interested in malini
sippy wanted shatrughan sinha to play the part of jai but there were already several big stars signed and amitabh bachchan who was not extremely popular yet lobbied hard to get the part for himself
during the film 's production four of the leads became romantically involved
bachchan married bhaduri four months before filming started
this led to shooting delays when bhaduri became pregnant with their daughter shweta
by the time of the film 's release she was pregnant with their son abhishek
dharmendra had begun wooing malini during their earlier film seeta aur geeta <year> and used the location shoot of sholay to further pursue her
during their romantic scenes dharmendra would often pay the light boys to spoil the shot thereby ensuring many retakes and allowing him to spend more time with her
the couple married five years after the film 's release
the filmmakers had to build a road from the bangalore highway to ramanagara for convenient access to the sets
art director ram yedekar had an entire township built on the site
a prison set was constructed near rajkamal studio in mumbai also outdoors to match the natural lighting of the on @-@ location sets
one part of ramanagara was for a time called sippy nagar as a tribute to the director of the film
as of <year> a visit to the sholay rocks where much the film was shot was still being offered to tourists travelling through ramanagara
filming began on location on <num> october <year> with a scene featuring bachchan and bhaduri
the film had a lavish production for its time with frequent banquets and parties for the cast took two and a half years to make and went over budget
one reason for its high cost was that sippy re @-@ filmed scenes many times to get his desired effect
yeh dosti a <num> @-@ minute song sequence took <num> days to shoot two short scenes in which radha lights lamps took <num> days to film because of lighting problems and the shooting of the scene in which gabbar kills the imam 's son lasted <num> days
the train robbery sequence shot on the mumbai – pune railway route near panvel took more than <num> weeks to complete
sholay was the first indian film to have a stereophonic soundtrack and to use the <num> mm widescreen format
however since actual <num> mm cameras were expensive at the time the film was shot on traditional <num> mm film and the <num> <num> picture was subsequently converted to a <num>
<num> <num> frame
regarding the process sippy said a <num> sic format takes the awe of the big screen and magnifies it even more to make the picture even bigger but since i also wanted a spread of sound we used six @-@ track stereophonic sound and combined it with the big screen
it was definitely a differentiator
the use of <num> mm was emphasised by film posters on which the name of the film was stylised to match the cinemascope logo
film posters also sought to differentiate the film from those which had come before one of them added the tagline the greatest star cast ever assembled – the greatest story ever told
gabbar 's death scene and the scene in which the imam 's son is killed were cut from the film by india 's censor board as was the scene in which thakur 's family is massacred
the censor board was concerned about the violence and that viewers may be influenced to violate the law by punishing people severely
although sippy fought to keep the scenes eventually he had to re @-@ shoot the ending of the film and as directed by the censor board have the police arrive just before thakur can kill gabbar
the censored theatrical version was the only one seen by audiences for fifteen years
the original unedited cut of the film finally came out in a british release on vhs in <year>
since then eros international has released two versions on dvd
the director 's cut of the film preserves the original full frame and is <num> minutes in length the censored widescreen version is <num> minutes long
koushik banerjea a sociologist in the london school of economics notes that sholay exhibits a sympathetic construction of rogue masculinity exemplified by the likeable outlaws jai and veeru
banerjea argues during the film the moral boundary between legality and criminality gradually erodes
film scholar wimal dissanayake agrees that the film brought a new stage in the evolving dialectic between violence and social order to indian cinema
film scholar m
madhava prasad states that jai and veeru represent a marginalised population that is introduced into conventional society
prasad says that through the elements of revenge included in the plot and the application of jai and veeru 's criminality for the greater good the narrative reflects reactionary politics and the audience is compelled to accept feudal order
banerjea explains that though jai and veeru are mercenaries they are humanised by their emotional needs
such dualism makes them vulnerable in contrast to the pure evil of gabbar singh
gabbar singh the film 's antagonist was well received by the audience despite his pervasive sadistic cruelty
dissanayake explains that the audience was fascinated by the dialogues and mannerisms of the character and this element of spectacle outweighed his actions a first for indian melodrama
he notes that the picturisation of violence in the film was glamourised and uninhibited
he further notes that unlike earlier melodramas in which the female body occupies the audience 's attention as an object of male fetish in sholay the male body becomes the centrepiece
it becomes the battleground where good and evil compete for supremacy
dissanayake argues that sholay can be viewed as a national allegory it lacks a comforting logical narrative it shows social stability being repeatedly challenged and it shows the devaluation of human life resulting from a lack of emotions
taken together these elements comprise the allegorical representation of india
the narrative style of sholay with its violence revenge and vigilante action is occasionally compared by scholars to the political unrest in india at the time of its release
this tension culminated in the emergency rule by decree declared by prime minister indira gandhi in <year>
dissanayeke and sahai note that although the film borrowed heavily from the hollywood western genre particularly in its visuals it was successfully indianised
as an example william van der heide has compared a massacre scene in sholay with a similar scene in once upon a time in the west
although both films were similar in technical style sholay emphasised indian family values and melodramatic tradition while the western was more materialistic and restrained in its approach
maithili rao in encyclopedia of hindi cinema notes that sholay infuses the style of the western genre into a feudalistic ethos
ted shen of the chicago reader notes sholay 's hysterical visual style and intermittent populist message
cultural critic and islamist scholar ziauddin sardar lampoons the film in his book the secret politics of our desires innocence culpability and indian popular cinema both for its caricature and stereotyping of muslim and women characters and for what he calls mockery of innocent villagers
sardar notes that the two most prominent muslim characters in the film are soorma bhopali a buffoonish criminal and an impotent victim of the bandits the imam
meanwhile the sole function of one female character radha is to suffer her fate in silence while the other female lead basanti is just a garrulous village belle
some scholars have indicated that sholay contains homosocial themes
ted shen describes the male bonding shown in the film as bordering on camp style
dina holtzman in her book bollywood and globalization indian popular cinema nation and diaspora states that the death of jai and resultant break of bonding between the two male leads is necessary for the sake of establishing a normative heterosexual relationship that of veeru and basanti

the songs used in the film and released on the original soundtrack are listed below
following that is a list of unused tracks and dialogues which were released later on an updated soundtrack

in a <year> paper submitted to london 's symposium on sound in cinema film critic shoma a
chatterji said sholay offers a model lesson on how sound can be used to signify the terror a character evokes
sholay is also exemplary in its use of soundmatching to jump cut to a different scene and time without breaking the continuity of the narrative yet intensifying the drama
due to lacklustre reviews and a lack of effective visual marketing tools it saw poor financial returns in its first two weeks
from the third week however viewership picked up owing to positive word of mouth
during the initial slow period the director and writer considered re @-@ shooting some scenes so that amitabh bachchan 's character would not die
when business picked up they abandoned this idea

certain scenes and dialogues from the film earned iconic status in india such as kitne aadmi the how many men were there jo dar gaya samjho mar gaya one who is scared is dead and bahut yaarana laagta hai looks like you two are very close – all dialogues of gabbar singh
these and other popular dialogues entered the people 's daily vernacular
characters and dialogues from the film continue to be referred to and parodied in popular culture
gabbar singh the sadistic villain ushered in an era in hindi films characterised by seemingly omnipotent oppressors as villains who play the pivotal role in setting up the context of the story such as shakal played by kulbhushan kharbanda of shaan <year> mogambo amrish puri of mr
india <year> and bhujang amrish puri of tridev <year>

he claimed that an unnamed army unit had requested that tot buy it <num> million baht worth of electronic equipment
upon receiving the request vuthipong demanded to know why neither the army nor the defence ministry used their own secret budgets to purchase the equipment and why an internal army unit rather than the kingdom 's main national security organisations had made the request
saprang denied that there was any lack of transparency in the request for financial support
vuthipong claimed that the equipment should only have cost <num> million baht not <num> million baht
he was fired and expelled from the board soon after refusing to sign off on the deal
the board later appointed col

<num> airlines threatened to halt flights to thailand if they were forced to move back to don muang airport
saprang also refused to authorize urgent repairs on the airport tarmac despite warnings from engineers
karun chandrarangsu president of the engineering institute of thailand noted suvarnabhumi is like a patient in a coma who continues to suffer from severe bleeding
stopping the blood flow now is more urgent and important than debating what caused the injury
the engineering institute of thailand sent a formal warning to aot in november <year> about the urgent need to drain water from beneath the tarmac and noted that immediate action should be taken
the aot did nothing about the problem suebsak promboon of the eit noted
the situation might not have become this bad if the water had been drained then
suebsak promboon a senior foundation engineer and a member of the tortrakul yomnak @-@ led airport tarmac inspection panel accused the aot of refusing to take any actions to solve the problems at the airport
the airport faced ongoing operational challenges including a computer virus that shut down the automated luggage bomb @-@ scanning system in june <year>
a study by the international air transport association iata released in july <year> found the airport unsafe citing numerous spots where checked passengers can meet people who have not passed through security checkpoints
serious security gaps at suvarnabhumi airport became known to the public beginning in early <year>
the international air transport association iata found that there were many spots in the passenger terminal where checked passengers can meet people who have not passed through security checks and could receive unchecked objects and then carry them on board aircraft
the iata also suggested that aot deploy its own security staff instead of contracting out the job to the loxley @-@ icts consortium
aot threatened the consortium with contract termination but didn 't follow through with its threat even though the consortium failed to live up to its contract
six months later aot stated that it still couldn 't make up its mind on how it should improve airport security
aot said it was open to all possible options and has taken no action to upgrade the problem
many delegates and accompanying members shared the same surname and the trip which cost <num>
<num> million baht was attacked for squandering state funds for personal pleasure disbursing unrealistic expenses and inflating costs
the travel agent along received a <num> @,@ <num> baht commission fee for booking the trip
saprang denied any wrongdoing and claimed he was the victim of a smear campaign
he also noted that if you knew my character you would know that even if a relative joined the trip he should have realised that he should work hard
he also noted that instead of being a viewed as a defendant he should be viewed as a hero for bringing down the thaksin government
saprang then summoned the leader of the aot labor union in order to identify who leaked information about the trip to his accusers

financial performance continued to spiral downwards in the <num> quarter of <year>
net profit for the period ending june fell by <num> from a year before despite higher traffic and a <num>
<num> increase in revenue
the fall in profit was attributed to aot 's court case against king power the operator of duty @-@ free shops within suvarnabhumi airport
king power 's concession was suspended while the case was in court forcing aot to stop reporting earnings from the concessionaire
after the coup saprang called thaksin a traitor and said that he should be banished to live forever in the jungle
he also accused thaksin of spying on the military while he was prime minister
although saprang and general sonthi accused thaksin of insulting and disrespecting king bhumibol he noted that the junta did not pursue lèse majesté charges against thaksin because the police corrupted the evidence and delivered such a weak case that the attorney @-@ general could not file a lawsuit
a vocal self @-@ proclaimed royalist he insisted that various groups actively tried to challenge the monarchy and that he couldn 't stand it
he noted i am a soldier born to protect the crown
they could only challenge the monarchy over my dead body
saprang also suspected that oliver jufer a swiss man who was jailed for lèse majesté for spraying paint on a portrait of image of king bhumibol was hired by somebody to perform his vandalism
saprang ordered a military investigation into the matter
the results have not been made public
saprang claimed that the evidence and intelligence information proves that the bombs were the dirty work of politicians who lost power and benefits
bad soldiers loyal to bad politicians collaborated with them with the intention to topple this government
however his claim was contradicted just an hour later by prime minister surayud chulanont
in may <year> saprang claimed that he had information regarding the seizure of instructional manual on terrorism in bangkok from a london apartment by english soldiers and police
he said he could not disclose any further information but told the public to connect the dots themselves
days later a bomb exploded outside of chitrlada palace
saprang later clarified his remark saying the bangkok terrorism manual discovery had been made in the early <num>
deputy chief of the british mission in bangkok andy pierce said he was concerned by saprang 's remarks which he insisted were baseless
the bangkok post reported that pridiyathorn resigned in protest after a cns member lobbied him to sell shares of irpc formerly known as thai petrochemical industry back to a former shareholder
the newspaper identified saprang as the unnamed cns member
saprang 's brother chienchuang was a key financial advisor to prachai liaophairat the estranged founder of tpi
chienchuang 's relations with the junta came under further public scrutiny when it was revealed that he was hired by the junta in order to lead a campaign to discredit deposed premier thaksin shinawatra
politicians hired as part of the cns campaign included chat pattana party leader korn dabbaransi democrats korn chatikavanij alongkorn palabutr and korbsak sabavasu prapat panya @-@ chatraksa a key thai rak thai member who defected to the chat thai party plus ex @-@ senator kraisak choonhavan

in an interview with thai rath thailand 's most popular newspaper on <num> april <year> he called an unspecified enemy a mad dog who he claimed was destroying the monarchy
he said that it was necessary to shoot the dog with a machine gun
in the same interview he threatened violent response to the bold words that came from the mouths of evil people who did not know restraint
he urged decisive action so that the public would believe that good had triumphed over evil
he unofficially competed with fellow assistant army commander anupong paochinda who as 1st army area commander secured bangkok on the night of the coup
the bangkok post reported in october <year> that sonthi was grooming anupong to be his successor by giving him responsibilities over coup logistics a greater task than had been assigned to saprang
the asia times quoted a former mp as saying that anupong is seen as the real force behind the coup
saprang is more vocal but he has no real base
the only way he could be seen as a promising leader is by pushing the country to the brink
in an interview saprang warned that the three pillars of society the nation the religion and the monarchy might crumble
if rogue politicians return to power following the next post coup general election
saprang also held the opinion that military coups against the government should never be ruled out
the abrogated <year> constitution had outlawed coups
a replacement constitution was at the time of saprang 's statement being drafted by a military appointed panel
saprang was sidelined in security plans preceding the constitutional tribunal 's <num> may <year> ruling on the dissolution of the thai rak thai and democrat parties

on <num> september <year> saprang 's rival assistant army commander @-@ in @-@ chief gen anupong paochinda was appointed as the new commander @-@ in @-@ chief of the army replacing the retiring general sonthi
anupong 's mandatory retirement occurred <year>
sonthi was after resignation appointed deputy prime minister
saprang was transferred to become deputy permanent secretary of the ministry of defense
saprang 's ally defence ministry deputy permanent secretary admiral bannawit kengrien called saprang 's transfer a demotion and a punishment
however saprang himself claimed that he did not feel slighted for being passed over noting that everything is over for him
bannawit himself was later transferred from defence ministry deputy permanent secretary to be a chief adviser of the ministry replaced by chief advisor general toosarat muang @-@ am
bannawit denied that his own transfer was the result of his criticism of saprang 's transfer
bannawit then announced that he would resign from the military and enter politics
there was also rampant speculation that saprang himself would resign and enter politics
although the kyodo news agency noted speculation that saprang would stage a coup against anupong saprang denied coup rumors saying that another coup would be suicide

<year> – <num> – november <num> <year> was a vaudeville performance artist thought to be of egyptian descent who was famous for acts of controlled regurgitation
his best @-@ known feats included water spouting smoke swallowing and nut and handkerchief swallowing followed by disgorgement in an order chosen by the audience
ali 's most famous stunt and the highlight of his act was drinking copious amounts of water followed by kerosene and then acting by turns as a human flamethrower and fire extinguisher as he expelled the two liquids onto a theatrical prop
while these stunts were performed a panel of audience members was invited to watch the show up close to verify that no trickery was employed
although never gaining wide fame ali had a dedicated following on the vaudeville circuit in the united states
he performed for heads of state including tsar nicholas ii of russia
judy garland named him her favorite vaudevillian and david blaine identified ali as his favorite magician
portions of his act were captured in the short film strange as it seems <year> and in politiquerias <year> the spanish @-@ language version of laurel and hardy 's chickens come home
two documentaries contain footage of ali taken from politiquerias <year> 's gizmo and <year> 's vaudeville
ali 's unusual gastric abilities led to rumors that the rockefeller institute had offered a large sum of money to obtain his stomach post @-@ mortem
after he died in england his body was offered to johns hopkins university for study though the offer was declined
his fame was as a practitioner of a recognized vaudeville subgenre known as a regurgitation act involving the swallowing of material or objects and their regurgitation in various ways
ali became aware as a child that he possessed an unusual gastric ability
he explained in response to audience questions at a performance held at st
mary 's hospital in niagara falls new york in may <year> that while swimming in the nile as a ten @-@ year @-@ old boy he naturally discovered that he could swallow a large amount of water and blow it out like a whale spouting
he continued to develop and refine the ability as he grew older
a more dramatic version of these events was provided by ali 's daughter almina ali in an interview in england after his death
she stated that his abilities were first learned through a single incident while bathing in the nile he inadvertently swallowed a fish and an ample volume of water
instead of dying as those present thought he might ali simply regurgitated the liquid and the fish without ill effect
ali learned that his regurgitation talents had the potential to entertain and to earn money through performance at the age of fifteen i tried out my tricks first of all in the street swallowing many glasses of water and then pouring forth a great fountain from one side of the road to the other
a cafe proprietor saw me doing this one day and chased me down the street
i thought he wanted to beat me up but no — all he did was to put a coin in my hand and ask me to repeat the trick
finally he was so delighted that he asked me to come to his cafe and entertain the customers
taking his abilities on the road ali met an italian man in cairo who signed him to a contract for music hall performances
ali performed under contract throughout europe and at times for heads of state
according to ali in or about <year> he was summoned by tsar nicholas ii of russia to perform at the winter palace in saint petersburg russia
he stated that the tsar must have liked my performance because he awarded me a special decoration which is now one of my most treasured possessions
following world war i ali began managing his own affairs and toured the world learning more tricks as he went
ali came to the united states with almina in the mid @-@ <num>
they performed together at fairs carnivals and in vaudeville sometimes advertised under the collective name hadji ali co
almina played the part of assistant in her father 's act billed in his shows as the princess
ali alone had a variety of stage names including the great egyptian miracle man the amazing regurgitator the egyptian enigma the human aquarium the human volcano and the <num> wonder of the scientific world
ali has been described as a large barrel @-@ chested and bearded man
that cut an imposing figure in his arab costume
although ali spoke a number of languages and became a naturalized u
s
citizen it was reported that almina acted as his interpreter in the united states and other places as he did not speak english and was illiterate
once he had gained some notoriety ali took on as his manager hubert julian a former colonel in the abyssinian air force
although he developed a significant following even being named judy garland 's favorite vaudevillian ali remained more a sideshow curiosity than a true vaudeville headliner according to at least one source
nevertheless at the time of his death in <year> julian commented that ali had earned big money in america — <num> @,@ <num> a week sometimes
i was building him up here in europe and had a continental tour arranged
after swallowing large amounts of water <num> to <num> glasses at a time he spouted the water in a continuous stream for a sustained period of time sometimes approaching one minute
another common trick was to swallow <num> to <num> unshelled hazelnuts although one of his posters advertised <num> pecans followed by another nut of a different variety such as an almond
ali then brought them up one by one with the odd @-@ nut @-@ out produced at a mark called out by the audience
in another trick ali swallowed three to six handkerchiefs of different hues and then produced them in a color order requested by audience members
in a <year> article appearing in the lowell sun newspaper physician morris fishbein speculated that for ali 's nut feat the one nut of a different variety was held in the mouth rather than swallowed thus allowing him to produce it on cue
dr
fishbein also stated that unnamed investigators were convinced that for ali 's handkerchief stunt to produce them in the sequence stipulated by the audience ali flavored the cloth and could therefore taste for the correct one as he brought them up
ali also swallowed live goldfish watches coins costume jewelry paper money peach pits stones live mice buttons pool balls and other odd objects
in another standard performance segment he placed eight or more lit cigarettes in his mouth but instead of inhaling he swallowed the smoke and after a significant time had passed issued it forth in a steady stream like an erupting volcano
ali 's longstanding finale was the swallowing of copious amounts of water again but this time followed by a pint of kerosene
a prop was then produced typically a model castle or house made of metal set on a table within which a small flame burned
lighter than water and immiscible with it the kerosene floated above the liquid in ali 's gut allowing him to disgorge it first
the stage thus set and to a drum roll or an imitation of fire bells ali became a human flamethrower spewing the accelerant in a long stream over the sacrificial prop setting it ablaze
once the kerosene was exhausted the water followed streaming out his mouth in a long flow from up to six feet away extinguishing the fire
at some performances a panel or jury from the audience was invited on stage to verify that no trick mechanism was being employed — that he was actually swallowing the items in question and delivering them back through acts of regurgitation
sometimes ali would stroll into the audience during his nut swallowing trick
his stomach exposed by his standard costume he invited audience members to pat his stomach allowing them to hear the nuts rattling within
one newspaper reported that ali 's feats essentially controlled vomiting were performed in a manner without the least bit of unpleasantness or anything bordering on repulsiveness
not everyone felt the same at least one of ali 's engagements was cut short once the proprietor realized that the nature of the act was killing their supper shows
famed escapologist and magician harry houdini remarked in his <year> work miracle mongers and their methods that water spouting was a performance that could not fail to disgust a modern audience
the abilities of ali fascinated the public and medical authorities
as reported in a <year> sheboygan press article at one of ali 's acts a number of doctors attended and thoroughly examined him during the performance
they came away satisfied that he was actually imbibing and regurgitating the material and objects as claimed but remained mystified over his extraordinary performance
according to an article appearing in the naugatuck daily news physicians of three continents have puzzled over the gastronomical mechanism of this human ostrich without success
x @-@ ray experiments have been made during his exhibition without a plausible explanation forthcoming that satisfies the critical in fact the profession of surgery has thrown up its hands in amazement over this human ostrich
ali also had a bit part as the turkish landlord in warner bros
<year> film scarlet dawn starring douglas fairbanks jr
and nancy carroll
two documentaries contain footage of ali taken from politiquerias <year> 's gizmo and <year> 's vaudeville a documentary produced by kcts @-@ tv that exhibits <num> vaudeville acts over a two @-@ hour running time
the documentary has since aired on the public broadcasting service 's american masters series numerous times
speaking about the democratic nature of the vaudeville performance circuit vaudeville 's writer and executive producer said in reference to ali that the film embraced everything from caruso to a guy who threw up
by contrast in episode <num> of the sundance channel television program iconoclasts magician david blaine speaks enthusiastically of ali
during the episode blaine shows artist chuck close ali 's kerosene and water finale footage from politiquerias and comments that ali is his favorite magician
it 's real but nobody 's been able to do it since
his name was hadji ali
he 's my favorite of all time
even before his death a rumor had circulated that the rockefeller institute sought to procure ali 's stomach upon his death and would pay as much as <num> @,@ <num> for it
this claim appeared in a poster advertising ali 's impending appearance at a theater during his lifetime
after ali 's death was reported the rumor resurfaced as an active offer of <num> @,@ <num>
when a rockefeller institute manager was interviewed about the story he said the offer had never been made but that nevertheless we should very much like to see the body
almina and julian transported ali 's body back to the united states on board the queen mary
according to a november <num> <year> article in the new york post upon their arrival almina offered her father 's body to maryland 's johns hopkins university for investigation by surgeons after which it would be transported to egypt for interment in a mausoleum
however the afro @-@ american newspaper reported on december <num> <year> that johns hopkins officials had declined the offer
britain and france were not at war at the time of the engagement but french support for the kingdom of mysore in the conflict with the british east india company had led to royal navy patrols stopping and searching french ships sailing for the mysorean port of mangalore
when a french convoy from mahé passed the british port of tellicherry in november <year> commodore william cornwallis sent a small squadron to intercept the french ships
as the british force under captain sir richard strachan approached the convoy the escorting frigate résolue opened fire
a general action followed with strachan succeeding in forcing the french ship to surrender within twenty minutes and both sides suffering damage and casualties
all of the french vessels were searched and subsequently returned to mahé the local french authorities reacting furiously at what they perceived as a violation of their neutral position
messages were sent back to france reporting the action from commodore saint @-@ félix but they evoked little response
although under normal circumstances the battle might have provoked a diplomatic incident the upheavals of the ongoing french revolution meant that the despatches had little effect
for the next two years the war continued as british forces and their allies drove the mysore armies back towards the capital of seringapatam
both sides were reliant on supply by sea to maintain their campaigns inland the british forces were supported from their major ports at bombay and madras later stationing additional forces at the small port of tellicherry inside mysore territory
the mysorean forces were supplied through mangalore by french ships
france had been an ally of the tipu sultan 's father hyder ali during the second anglo @-@ mysore war and although the political instability caused by the french revolution in europe prevented active involvement they ensured that their ships kept up a supply of equipment to mysore throughout the war
in an effort to eliminate french support commodore william cornwallis the british naval commander in the region stationed a squadron of frigates at tellicherry where they were ideally situated to blockade mangalore and prevent the passage of shipping into mysorean territory
the squadron consisted of cornwallis in hms minerva captain sir richard strachan in hms phoenix and hms perseverance under captain isaac smith
the french operated a squadron of their own on the coast led by commodore saint @-@ félix and consisting of two frigates based at mahé a small french port <num> miles <num> km south of tellicherry
the french had communicated to the british at tellicherry that they would not submit to any attempts to search their vessels but strachan and cornwallis replied that they would enforce the blockade of mangalore whatever the consequences
the convoy included two merchant vessels and the frigate résolue a <num> @-@ gun warship under captain callamand
passing northwards the convoy soon passed tellicherry and cornwallis sent strachan with phoenix and perseverance to stop and inspect the french ships to ensure they were not carrying military supplies
as smith halted the merchant ships and sent boats to inspect them strachan did the same to résolue hailing the french captain and placing an officer in a small boat to board the frigate
the french captain was outraged at this violation of his neutrality and responded by opening fire british sources suggest that his initial target was the small boat although phoenix was the ship most immediately damaged
strachan was unsurprised at the french reaction and returned fire immediately the proximity of the ships preventing any manoeuvres
within twenty minutes the combat was decided the french captain hauling down his colours with his ship battered and more than <num> men wounded or dead
the french ship carried significantly weaker cannon than phoenix with <num> and <num> pounder guns to the <num> and <num> pounders aboard the british squadron
in addition résolue was heavily outnumbered no other french warships were in the area while the british had three large frigates within sight
french losses eventually totalled <num> men killed and <num> wounded strachan suffering just six killed and <num> wounded in return
the french officer however refused insisting that he and his ship were treated as prisoners of war
cornwallis ordered the merchant ships released to continue their journey and for the frigate to be towed back to mahé where it was anchored in the roads with its sails and topmasts struck
provision was subsequently made at mahé by strachan for the wounded french sailors
soon afterwards saint @-@ félix arrived at mahé in his frigate cybèle and reacted furiously at the discovery that one of his neutral ships had been attacked and captured by the british
when cornwallis insisted that his ships had been acting within their orders saint @-@ félix promised reprisals if any of his vessels were attacked again and withdrew with both cybèle and résolue later in the day followed by minerva and phoenix
one account reported that saint @-@ félix actually ordered his crew to fire on cornwallis but that they refused
the british shadowed the french for several days openly stopping and searching french merchant ships but without provoking a response from saint @-@ félix
résolue and phoenix were subsequently detached by their commanders cornwallis and saint @-@ félix remaining in contact for several more days before finally separating
news of the encounter was conveyed back to france but the country was at this time in one of the most turbulent eras of the ongoing revolution and little notice was taken of events in india
historian william james notes that under normal political circumstances the action would have had more significant ramifications while edward pelham brenton claims that the french deliberately ignored the report out of fear of antagonising britain
in britain the admiralty approved of cornwallis actions suggesting that the french were deliberately using the guise of trade to support mysore against britain
the action had no effect on the ongoing war in india which was now centred on the inland city of seringapatam
as british forces closed on the city in february <year> the tipu sultan initiated peace talks which brought the war to an end in exchange for concessions to the company and its indian allies

one of the tracks mendez helped to create is te busqué which is co @-@ written by and features juanes who collaborated with furtado on his <year> song fotografía
during her time in los angeles she worked with rick nowels who co @-@ wrote and produced in god 's hands and somebody to love
in miami florida furtado collaborated with pharrell who introduced her to reggaeton and who gave her a shout @-@ out in his <year> single can i have it like that and scott storch with whom she recorded a straight @-@ up rap song before entering the studio with timbaland
he and his protégé at the time danja co @-@ produced eight of the tracks with another produced solely by danja
for some of the beats on the songs timbaland finished work on ones already present in the studio that were half @-@ developed or just nucleuses the rest were completely reworked
furtado recorded around forty tracks for loose deciding which she would include based on the sonics of the album — she called timbaland a sonic extraterrestrial who came up with a sequence of songs that flowed and said that the one she had devised was supposedly unsatisfactory
she recorded an unreleased collaboration with justin timberlake crowd control which she described as kind of sexy and a cute clubby upbeat fun track
other songs considered for inclusion on the album include chill boy friend of mine go hands in the air pretty boy vice and weak
furtado said in her diary on her official website that she recorded a remix of maneater with rapper lil wayne it was only released as part of a compilation album timbaland 's remix soundtrack collection she also used the instrumental of the song during many television performances of maneater
a version of all good things come to an end featuring vocals by coldplay lead singer chris martin who co @-@ wrote the song was not released after a request from martin 's label emi
the song was released on the album but only furtado 's vocals are featured
furtado explained that loose was <num> percent written with a beat first and then i ’ d write my melodies and songs to the beat
it was named partly after the spontaneous decisions she made when creating the album
the album is also called loose because it is the opposite of calculated and came naturally to furtado and timbaland she called him her distant musical cousin because he was always pushing boundaries and always carving out his own path which she believed she was doing with loose
i think you have to keep surprising people as an artist and i like that — i love doing that she said
loose was also named partly for the r b girl group tlc who furtado said she admires for taking back their sexuality showing they were complete women
she said she wanted the album to be assertive and cool and sexy but fun like tlc mc lyte queen latifah and janet jackson who inspired furtado because as she put it she was comfortable in her sexuality and womanhood when her <year> single that 's the way love goes was released
during the recording of loose furtado listened to several electro and rock musicians including bloc party system of a down m
i
a
feist queens of the stone age metric and death from above <year> some of whom influenced the rock sound present on the album and the coughing laughing distorted basslines that were kept in the songs deliberately
according to her music by such bands is very loud and has a garage theme to it some of which she felt she captured on the album
furtado has said rock music is rhythmic again and hip hop @-@ influenced after it had become so churning and boring
because the mixing engineers were aware of timbaland and furtado 's rock influences the songs were mixed on a mixing board in the studio instead of the fancy mixer at the end
furtado said she preferred the louder volume that process gave to the album because she wanted it to sound like her demo tapes which she prefers to her finished albums
she said it didn 't have that final wash over it it didn 't have the final pressing at the end save for a couple sounds
after she believed she had accomplished that she felt she had freedom to make the type of music she really love d
furtado said her previous problem with hip hop was that she did not think it was good enough to base one of her albums on but that she then asked herself why she was being pretentious
the album represents her separating from such notions and in her words jumping in the deep end of the pool — ahh screw it this is fun
furtado said she considers herself all over the map and promiscuous musically because she is not faithful to one style
for the first time furtado worked with a variety of record producers and followed a more collaborative approach in creating the album
produced primarily by timbaland and danja loose showcases furtado experimenting with a more r b – hip hop sound and as she put it the surreal theatrical elements of <num> music
she has categorized the album 's sound as punk @-@ hop which she describes as eurythmics @-@ influenced modern poppy spooky music and stated that there 's a mysterious after @-@ midnight vibe to it that 's extremely visceral
furtado has described the album as more urban more american more hip @-@ hop and more simplified than her earlier work which she said was more layered and textured because she tend s to overthink things
in contrast during her studio time with timbaland she said she was in the vip boys club of just letting go and being more impulsive
according to furtado instead of pristine stuff the album features really raw elements such as distorted bass lines laughter from studio outtakes and general room for error
furtado has said loose is not as much about the lyrics which are not included in the liner notes as it is about indulging in pleasures — whether it 's dancing or lovemaking
according to her she wasn 't trying to be sexy with the album — i think i just am sexy now she said
because you live from the outside in
now that i 'm an adult i care about the inside of me
before i said i didn 't care about what people thought about me but i really did
maneater is an uptempo electro rock song that combines <num> electro synths and a more dance @-@ oriented beat
the up @-@ tempo song has prominent electropop and synthpop influences and is lyrically related to how people become hot on themselves when dancing in their underwear in front of a mirror
promiscuous featuring timbaland was inspired by a flirting exchange furtado had with attitude who co @-@ wrote the song she has characterised the fifth track showtime as a proper r b slow jam
no hay igual is a hip hop and reggaeton song that has a spanglish tongue twister over future @-@ tropic beats
the song contains a sharp mix of percussion and empowered chanting
in no hay igual furtado sings in spanish and raps in portuguese over a reggaeton rhythm
the album also features more introspective songs and the sunday times wrote that it has a surprising sadness to it
the seventh track te busqué which features latin singer juanes is about furtado 's experiences with depression which she said she has had periodically since she was around seventeen years old
furtado said she was unsure what say it right is about but that it encapsulates her feeling when she wrote it and taps into this other sphere in an interview for the sunday times it was mentioned that it is about her breakup with dj jasper gahunia the father of her daughter
in god 's hands another song on the album was also inspired by the end of their relationship

allmusic and musicomh cited the revitalising effect of timbaland on furtado 's music and the guardian called it slick smart and surprising
q found most of it to be an inventive hip @-@ hop @-@ inflected delight
kelefa sanneh of the new york times wrote that the music and the lyrics are mainly aimed at dance floors and yet this album keeps reminding listeners that a dance floor is one of the most complicated places on earth
in its review allmusic wrote it 's on this final stretch of the album that the furtado and timbaland pairing seems like a genuine collaboration staying true to the nelly of her first two albums but given an adventurous production that helps open her songs up
timbaland has revitalized nelly furtado both creatively and commercially with loose
she won her first brit award — best international female — in <year>
in a mixed review nick catucci of the village voice felt that furtado sauces up a bit too luridly and lacks chemistry with timbaland writing that loose isn 't a love child but a bump @-@ and @-@ grind that never finds a groove
vibe stated she loses herself in gwen stefani – like posturing as on “ glow ” and ethnic fusions like “ no hay igual ” or “ te busqué
in his consumer guide for the village voice robert christgau gave the album a b and named it dud of the month indicating a bad record whose details rarely merit further thought
christgau viewed that its dance @-@ oriented tracks might accomplish god 's great plan on the dance @-@ floor
but as songs they 're not much
according to maclean 's magazine some said that furtado 's progression was a natural transformation of a pop singer others believed that she had sold out in an effort to garner record sales particularly after her second album was a commercial failure in comparison to her first
maclean 's wrote that her makeover seems a bit forced and contrasted her with singers such as madonna and emily haines of metric they seem to be completely in control even somewhat intimidating in their sexuality they 've made a calculated decision for commercial and feminist reasons
in contrast furtado 's new overt sexuality comes off as unoriginal — overdone by thousands of pouty pop stars with a quarter of furtado 's natural talent
the revamping feels as if it 's been imposed rather than chosen by the unique articulate singer we 've seen in the past
dose magazine wrote that furtado 's new highly sexualized image was manufactured and noted the involvement in the album 's development of geffen 's jimmy iovine who helped to develop the pussycat dolls a girl group known for their sexually suggestive dance routines
the writer also criticised furtado 's discussion of her buttocks and apparent rejection of feminism in a blender magazine interview writing girls do you hear that churning those are the ideas of gloria steinem turning in their grave
a writer for the canadian broadcasting corporation said that cynics could attribute furtado 's commercial success with loose to her amped @-@ up sex appeal
the writer added that the failure of janet jackson 's album damita jo <year> indicated such a move was not infallible
furtado was still demure compared to many of her competitors — she avoided sporting lingerie or performing christina aguilera @-@ style gyrations or calisthenics in the promiscuous and maneater videos
despite its dramatic arrival
furtado 's new image doesn ’ t feel calculated he said
she seems to be thinking less and feeling more to the benefit of her music
in early <year> a video hosted on youtube led to reports that the song do it and the timbaland @-@ produced ringtone block party that inspired it used — without authorization — the melody from finnish demoscene musician janne tempest suni 's song acidjazzed evening winner of the assembly <year> oldskool music competition
timbaland used the record of c64 adaptation of the song written by glenn rune gallefoss grg
timbaland admitted sampling the song but said that he had no time to research its intellectual owner
hannu sormunen a finnish representative of universal which represents nelly furtado in finland commented the controversy as follows in the <num> january <year> issue of iltalehti in case that the artist decides to pursue the matter further it 's on him to go to america and confront them with the local use of law
it will require a considerable amount of faith and of course money
on <num> february <year> timbaland commented on the issue in an mtv interview it makes me laugh
the part i don 't understand the dude is trying to act like i went to his house and took it from his computer
i don 't know him from a can of paint
i 'm <num> years deep
that 's how you attack a king you attack moi come on man
you got to come correct
you the laughing stock
people are like you can 't be serious
on <num> june <year> mikko välimäki who is one of the legal counsels of kernel records the owner of the sound recording rights reported that the case had been filed in florida
in january <year> turkish newspapers reported that kalan müzik the record label that released turkish folk singer muhlis akarsu 's album ya dost ya dost pressed charges against furtado for the loose track wait for you which label officials said features the bağlama instrumental part of akarsu 's song allah allah desem gelsem

a lustrous gray metalloid it is found in nature mainly as the sulfide mineral stibnite sb2s3
antimony compounds have been known since ancient times and were used for cosmetics metallic antimony was also known but it was erroneously identified as lead upon its discovery
in the west it was first isolated by vannoccio biringuccio and described in <year> although in primitive cultures its powder has been used to cure eye ailments as also for eye shadow since time immemorial and is often referred to by its arabic name kohl
for some time china has been the largest producer of antimony and its compounds with most production coming from the xikuangshan mine in hunan
the industrial methods to produce antimony are roasting and reduction using carbon or direct reduction of stibnite with iron
the largest applications for metallic antimony are as alloying material for lead and tin and for lead antimony plates in lead – acid batteries
alloying lead and tin with antimony improves the properties of the alloys which are used in solders bullets and plain bearings
antimony compounds are prominent additives for chlorine and bromine @-@ containing fire retardants found in many commercial and domestic products
an emerging application is the use of antimony in microelectronics
<num>
as expected from periodic trends it is more electronegative than tin or bismuth and less electronegative than tellurium or arsenic
antimony is stable in air at room temperature but reacts with oxygen if heated to form antimony trioxide sb2o3
antimony is a silvery lustrous gray metalloid that has a mohs scale hardness of <num>
thus pure antimony is too soft to make hard objects coins made of antimony were issued in china 's guizhou province in <year> but because of their rapid wear their minting was discontinued
antimony is resistant to attack by acids
four allotropes of antimony are known a stable metallic form and three metastable forms explosive black and yellow
elemental antimony is a brittle silver @-@ white shiny metalloid
when slowly cooled molten antimony crystallizes in a trigonal cell isomorphic with the gray allotrope of arsenic
a rare explosive form of antimony can be formed from the electrolysis of antimony trichloride
when scratched with a sharp implement an exothermic reaction occurs and white fumes are given off as metallic antimony is formed when rubbed with a pestle in a mortar a strong detonation occurs
black antimony is formed upon rapid cooling of vapor derived from metallic antimony
it has the same crystal structure as red phosphorus and black arsenic it oxidizes in air and may ignite spontaneously
at <num> ° c it gradually transforms into the stable form
the yellow allotrope of antimony is the most unstable
it has only been generated by oxidation of stibine sbh3 at − <num> ° c
above this temperature and in ambient light this metastable allotrope transforms into the more stable black allotrope
elemental antimony adopts a layered structure space group r3m no
<num> in which layers consist of fused ruffled six @-@ membered rings
the nearest and next @-@ nearest neighbors form an irregular octahedral complex with the three atoms in the same double layer being slightly closer than the three atoms in the next
this relatively close packing leads to a high density of <num>
<num> g cm3 but the weak bonding between the layers leads to the low hardness and brittleness of antimony
<num> and 123sb with a natural abundance of <num>
<num>
it also has <num> radioisotopes of which the longest @-@ lived is 125sb with a half @-@ life of <num>
<num> years
in addition <num> metastable states have been characterized
the most stable of these is 120m1sb with a half @-@ life of <num>
<num> days
isotopes that are lighter than the stable 123sb tend to decay by β decay and those that are heavier tend to decay by β − decay with some exceptions

even though this element is not abundant it is found in over <num> mineral species
antimony is sometimes found natively e
g
on antimony peak but more frequently it is found in the sulfide stibnite sb2s3 which is the predominant ore mineral
the <num> oxidation state is more stable
in the gas phase this compound exists as sb 4o <num> but it polymerizes upon condensing
antimony pentoxide sb 4o <num> can only be formed by oxidation by concentrated nitric acid
antimony also forms a mixed @-@ valence oxide antimony tetroxide sb 2o <num> which features both sb iii and sb v
unlike oxides of phosphorus and arsenic these various oxides are amphoteric do not form well @-@ defined oxoacids and react with acids to form antimony salts
antimonous acid sb oh <num> is unknown but the conjugate base sodium antimonite na 3sbo <num> <num> forms upon fusing sodium oxide and sb 4o <num>
transition metal antimonites are also known
antimonic acid exists only as the hydrate hsb oh <num> forming salts containing the antimonate anion sb oh − <num>
dehydrating metal salts containing this anion yields mixed oxides
many antimony ores are sulfides including stibnite sb <num> <num> pyrargyrite ag 3sbs <num> zinkenite jamesonite and boulangerite
antimony pentasulfide is non @-@ stoichiometric and features antimony in the <num> oxidation state and s @-@ s bonds
several thioantimonides are known such as sb <num> <num> <num> − and sb <num> <num> <num> −
the trihalides sbf <num> sbcl <num> sbbr <num> and sbi <num> are all molecular compounds having trigonal pyramidal molecular geometry
the trifluoride sbf <num> is prepared by the reaction of sb 2o <num> with hf sb 2o <num> <num> hf → <num> sbf <num> <num> h 2o it is lewis acidic and readily accepts fluoride ions to form the complex anions sbf − <num> and sbf2 − <num>
molten sbf <num> is a weak electrical conductor
the trichloride sbcl <num> is prepared by dissolving sb <num> <num> in hydrochloric acid sb <num> <num> <num> hcl → <num> sbcl <num> <num> h <num> the pentahalides sbf <num> and sbcl <num> have trigonal bipyramidal molecular geometry in the gas phase but in the liquid phase sbf <num> is polymeric whereas sbcl <num> is monomeric
sbf <num> is a powerful lewis acid used to make the superacid fluoroantimonic acid h2sbf7
oxyhalides are more common for antimony than arsenic and phosphorus
antimony trioxide dissolves in concentrated acid to form oxoantimonyl compounds such as sbocl and sbo 2so <num>
antimony forms antimonides with metals such as indium antimonide insb and silver antimonide ag 3sb
the alkali metal and zinc antimonides such as na3sb and zn3sb2 are more reactive
treating these antimonides with acid produces the unstable gas stibine sbh <num> sb3 − <num> h → sbh <num> stibine can also be produced by treating sb3 salts with hydride reagents such as sodium borohydride
stibine decomposes spontaneously at room temperature
because stibine has a positive heat of formation it is thermodynamically unstable and thus antimony does not react with hydrogen directly
organoantimony compounds are typically prepared by alkylation of antimony halides with grignard reagents
a large variety of compounds are known with both sb iii and sb v centers including mixed chloro @-@ organic derivatives anions and cations
examples include sb c6h5 <num> triphenylstibine sb2 c6h5 <num> with an sb @-@ sb bond and cyclic sb c6h5 n
pentacoordinated organoantimony compounds are common examples being sb c6h5 <num> and several related halides
an artifact said to be part of a vase made of antimony dating to about <num> bc was found at telloh chaldea part of present @-@ day iraq and a copper object plated with antimony dating between <num> bc and <num> bc has been found in egypt
austen at a lecture by herbert gladstone in <year> commented that we only know of antimony at the present day as a highly brittle and crystalline metal which could hardly be fashioned into a useful vase and therefore this remarkable find artifact mentioned above must represent the lost art of rendering antimony malleable
moorey was unconvinced the artifact was indeed a vase mentioning that selimkhanov after his analysis of the tello object published in <year> attempted to relate the metal to transcaucasian natural antimony i
e
native metal and that the antimony objects from transcaucasia are all small personal ornaments
this weakens the evidence for a lost art of rendering antimony malleable
the roman scholar pliny the elder described several ways of preparing antimony sulfide for medical purposes in his treatise natural history
pliny the elder also made a distinction between male and female forms of antimony the male form is probably the sulfide while the female form which is superior heavier and less friable has been suspected to be native metallic antimony
the roman naturalist pedanius dioscorides mentioned that antimony sulfide could be roasted by heating by a current of air
it is thought that this produced metallic antimony
the first description of a procedure for isolating antimony is in the book de la pirotechnia of <year> by vannoccio biringuccio this predates the more famous <year> book by agricola de re metallica
in this context agricola has been often incorrectly credited with the discovery of metallic antimony
the book currus triumphalis antimonii the triumphal chariot of antimony describing the preparation of metallic antimony was published in germany in <year>
it was purported to have been written by a benedictine monk writing under the name basilius valentinus in the <num> century if it were authentic which it is not it would predate biringuccio
the metal antimony was known to german chemist andreas libavius in <year> who obtained it by adding iron to a molten mixture of antimony sulfide salt and potassium tartrate
this procedure produced antimony with a crystalline or starred surface
with the advent of challenges to phlogiston theory it was recognized that antimony is an element forming sulfides oxides and other compounds as is the case with other metals
the first natural occurrence of pure antimony in the earth 's crust was described by the swedish scientist and local mine district engineer anton von swab in <year> the type @-@ sample was collected from the sala silver mine in the bergslagen mining district of sala västmanland sweden
the egyptians called antimony mśdmt in hieroglyphs the vowels are uncertain but there is an arabic tradition that the word is ميسديميت mesdemet
the greek word στίμμι stimmi is probably a loan word from arabic or from egyptian stm and is used by attic tragic poets of the <num> century bc later greeks also used στἰβι stibi as did celsus and pliny writing in latin in the first century ad
pliny also gives the names stimi sic larbaris alabaster and the very common platyophthalmos wide @-@ eye from the effect of the cosmetic
later latin authors adapted the word to latin as stibium
the arabic word for the substance as opposed to the cosmetic can appear as إثمد ithmid athmoud othmod or uthmod
littré suggests the first form which is the earliest derives from stimmida an accusative for stimmi
the use of sb as the standard chemical symbol for antimony is due to jöns jakob berzelius who used this abbreviation of the name stibium
the medieval latin form from which the modern languages and late byzantine greek take their names for antimony is antimonium
the origin of this is uncertain all suggestions have some difficulty either of form or interpretation
the popular etymology from ἀντίμοναχός anti @-@ monachos or french antimoine still has adherents this would mean monk @-@ killer and is explained by many early alchemists being monks and antimony being poisonous
another popular etymology is the hypothetical greek word ἀντίμόνος antimonos against aloneness explained as not found as metal or not found unalloyed
lippmann conjectured a hypothetical greek word ανθήμόνιον anthemonion which would mean floret and cites several examples of related greek words but not that one which describe chemical or biological efflorescence
the early uses of antimonium include the translations in <num> – <num> by constantine the african of arabic medical treatises
several authorities believe antimonium is a scribal corruption of some arabic form meyerhof derives it from ithmid other possibilities include athimar the arabic name of the metalloid and a hypothetical as @-@ stimmi derived from or parallel to the greek

roskill estimates that secondary production globally in <year> was <num> @,@ <num> tonnes
antimony was ranked first in a risk list published by the british geological survey in the second half of <year>
the list provides an indication of the relative risk to the supply of chemical elements or element groups required to maintain the current british economy and lifestyle
also antimony was identified as one of <num> critical raw materials for the eu in a report published in <year> primarily due to the lack of supply outside china
reported production of antimony in china fell in <year> and is unlikely to increase in the coming years according to the roskill report
no significant antimony deposits in china have been developed for about ten years and the remaining economic reserves are being rapidly depleted
however the usgs expects more resources will be found
most antimony is mined as the sulfide lower @-@ grade ores are concentrated by froth flotation while higher @-@ grade ores are heated to <num> – <num> ° c the temperature at which stibnite melts and is separated from the gangue minerals
antimony can be isolated from the crude antimony sulfide by a reduction with scrap iron sb <num> <num> <num> fe → <num> sb <num> fes the sulfide is converted to an oxide and advantage is often taken of the volatility of antimony iii oxide which is recovered from roasting
this material is often used directly for the main applications impurities being arsenic and sulfide
isolating antimony from its oxide is performed by a carbothermal reduction <num> sb 2o <num> <num> c → <num> sb <num> co <num> the lower @-@ grade ores are reduced in blast furnaces while the higher @-@ grade ores are reduced in reverberatory furnaces
it is nearly always used in combination with halogenated flame retardants with the only exception being in halogen @-@ containing polymers
the formation of halogenated antimony compounds is the cause for the flame retarding effect of antimony trioxide due to reaction of these compounds with hydrogen atoms and probably also with oxygen atoms and oh radicals thus inhibiting fire
markets for these flame @-@ retardant applications include children 's clothing toys aircraft and automobile seat covers
it is also used in the fiberglass composites industry as an additive to polyester resins for such items as light aircraft engine covers
the resin will burn while a flame is held to it but will extinguish itself as soon as the flame is removed
for most applications involving lead varying amounts of antimony are used as alloying metal
in lead – acid batteries this addition improves the charging characteristics and reduces generation of unwanted hydrogen during charging
it is used in antifriction alloys such as babbitt metal in bullets and lead shot cable sheathing type metal for example for linotype printing machines solder some lead @-@ free solders contain <num> sb in pewter and in hardening alloys with low tin content in the manufacturing of organ pipes
one of these uses is as a stabilizer and a catalyst for the production of polyethyleneterephthalate
another application is to serve as a fining agent to remove microscopic bubbles in glass mostly for tv screens this is achieved by the interaction of antimony ions with oxygen interfering the latter from forming bubbles
the third major application is the use as pigment
antimony is being increasingly used in the semiconductor industry as a dopant for heavily doped n @-@ type silicon wafers in the production of diodes infrared detectors and hall @-@ effect devices
in the <num> tiny beads of a lead @-@ antimony alloy were used to dope the emitters and collectors of n @-@ p @-@ n alloy junction transistors with antimony

treatments principally containing antimony are known as antimonials and are used as emetics
antimony compounds are used as antiprotozoan drugs
potassium antimonyl tartrate or tartar emetic was once used as an anti @-@ schistosomal drug from <year> on
it was subsequently replaced by praziquantel
antimony and its compounds are used in several veterinary preparations like anthiomaline or lithium antimony thiomalate which is used as a skin conditioner in ruminants
antimony has a nourishing or conditioning effect on keratinized tissues at least in animals
antimony @-@ based drugs such as meglumine antimoniate are also considered the drugs of choice for treatment of leishmaniasis in domestic animals
unfortunately as well as having low therapeutic indices the drugs are poor at penetrating the bone marrow where some of the leishmania amastigotes reside and so cure of the disease – especially the visceral form – is very difficult
elemental antimony as an antimony pill was once used as a medicine
it could be reused by others after ingestion and elimination
in the heads of some safety matches antimony iii sulfide is used
antimony @-@ <num> is used together with beryllium in neutron sources the gamma rays emitted by antimony @-@ <num> initiate the photodisintegration of beryllium
the emitted neutrons have an average energy of <num> kev
antimony sulfides have been shown to help stabilize the friction coefficient in automotive brake pad materials
antimony also is used in the making of bullets and bullet tracers
this element is also used in paint and glass art crafts and as opacifier in enamel
the massive antimony metal does not affect human and environmental health
inhalation of antimony trioxide and similar poorly soluble sb iii dust particles such as antimony dust is considered harmful and suspected of causing cancer
however these effects are only observed with female rats and after long @-@ term exposure to high dust concentrations
the effects are hypothesized to be attributed to inhalation of poorly soluble sb particles leading to impaired lung clearance lung overload inflammation and ultimately tumour formation not to exposure to antimony ions oecd <year>
antimony chlorides are corrosive to skin
the effects of antimony are not comparable to arsenic this might be caused by the significant differences of uptake metabolism and excretion between arsenic and antimony
for oral absorption icrp <year> recommended values of <num> for tartar emetic and <num> for all other antimony compounds
dermal absorption for metals is estimated at most <num> herag <year>
inhalation absorption of antimony trioxide and other poorly soluble sb iii substances such as antimony dust is estimated at <num>

antimony is mainly excreted from the human body via urine
antimony and its compounds do not cause acute human health effects with the exception of antimony potassium tartrate tartar emetic a prodrug that is intentionally used to treat leishmaniasis patients
prolonged skin contact with antimony dust may cause dermatitis
however it was agreed at the european union level that the skin rashes observed are not substance @-@ specific but most probably due to a physical blocking of sweat ducts echa pr <num> <num> helsinki <num> july <year>

over the course of his career he served as director of both the national museum of wales and london museum director @-@ general of the archaeological survey of india and the founder and honorary director of the institute of archaeology in london further writing twenty @-@ four books on archaeological subjects
born in glasgow to a middle @-@ class family wheeler was raised largely in yorkshire before relocating to london in his teenage years
after studying classics at university college london ucl he began working professionally in archaeology specializing in the romano @-@ british period
during world war i he volunteered for service in the royal artillery being stationed on the western front where he rose to the rank of major and was awarded the military cross
returning to britain he obtained his doctorate from ucl before taking on a position at the national museum of wales first as keeper of archaeology and then as director during which time he oversaw excavation at the roman forts of segontium y gaer and isca augusta with the aid of his first wife tessa wheeler
influenced by the archaeologist augustus pitt rivers wheeler argued that excavation and the recording of stratigraphic context required an increasingly scientific and methodical approach developing the wheeler method
in <year> he was appointed keeper of the london museum there he oversaw a reorganisation of the collection successfully lobbied for increased funding and began lecturing at ucl
in <year> he established the institute of archaeology as part of the federal university of london adopting the position of honorary director
in this period he oversaw excavations of the roman sites at lydney park and verulamium and the iron age hill fort of maidan castle
during world war ii he re @-@ joined the armed forces and rose to the rank of brigadier serving in the north african campaign and then the allied invasion of italy
in <year> he was appointed director @-@ general of the archaeological survey of india through which he oversaw excavations of sites at harappa arikamedu and brahmagiri and implemented reforms to the subcontinent 's archaeological establishment
returning to britain in <year> he divided his time between lecturing for the institute of archaeology and acting as archaeological adviser to pakistan 's government
in later life his popular books cruise ship lectures and appearances on radio and television particularly the bbc series animal vegetable mineral helped to bring archaeology to a mass audience
appointed honorary secretary of the british academy he raised large sums of money for archaeological projects and was appointed british representative for several unesco projects
wheeler is recognised as one of the most important british archaeologists of the twentieth century responsible for successfully encouraging british public interest in the discipline and advancing methodologies of excavation and recording
further he is widely acclaimed as a major figure in the establishment of south asian archaeology
however many of his specific interpretations of archaeological sites have been discredited or reinterpreted and he was often criticised for bullying colleagues and sexually harassing young women
he was the first child of the journalist robert mortimer wheeler and his second wife emily wheeler née baynes
the son of a tea merchant based in bristol in youth robert had considered becoming a baptist minister but instead became a staunch freethinker while studying at the university of edinburgh
initially working as a lecturer in english literature robert turned to journalism after his first wife died in childbirth
his second wife emily shared her husband 's interest in english literature and was the niece of thomas spencer baynes a shakespearean scholar at st
andrews university
their marriage was emotionally strained a situation exacerbated by their financial insecurity
within two years of their son 's birth the family moved to edinburgh where a daughter named amy was born
the couple gave their two children nicknames with mortimer being boberic and amy being totsy
when wheeler was four his father was appointed chief leader writer for the bradford observer
the family relocated to saltaire a village northwest of bradford a cosmopolitan city in yorkshire northeast england which was then in the midst of the wool trade boom
wheeler was inspired by the moors surrounding saltaire and fascinated by the area 's archaeology
he later wrote about discovering a late prehistoric cup @-@ marked stone searching for lithics on ilkley moor and digging into a barrow on baildon moor
although suffering from ill health emily wheeler taught her two children with the help of a maid up to the age of seven or eight
mortimer remained emotionally distant from his mother instead being far closer to his father whose company he favoured over that of other children
his father had a keen interest in natural history and a love of fishing and shooting rural pursuits in which he encouraged mortimer to take part
robert acquired many books for his son particularly on the subject of art history with wheeler loving to both read and paint
in <year> wheeler joined bradford grammar school shortly before his ninth birthday where he proceeded straight to the second form
in <year> robert and emily had a second daughter whom they named betty mortimer showed little interest in this younger sister
in <year> robert agreed to take over as head of the london office of his newspaper by then renamed the yorkshire daily observer and so the family relocated to the southeast of the city in december settling into a house named carlton lodge on south croydon road west dulwich
in <year> they moved to <num> rollescourt avenue in nearby herne hill
rather than being sent for a conventional education when he was <num> wheeler was instructed to educate himself by spending time in london where he frequented the national gallery and the victoria and albert museum
at ucl he was taught by the prominent classicist a
e
housman
during his undergraduate studies he became editor of the union magazine for which he produced a number of illustrated cartoons
increasingly interested in art he decided to switch from classical studies to a course at ucl 's art school the slade school of fine art he returned to his previous subject after coming to the opinion that – in his words – he never became more than a conventionally accomplished picture maker
this interlude had adversely affected his classical studies and he received a second class ba on graduating
wheeler began studying for a master of arts degree in classical studies which he attained in <year>
during this period he also gained employment as the personal secretary of the ucl provost gregory foster although he later criticised foster for transforming the university from a college in the truly academic sense into a hypertrophied monstrosity as little like a college as a plesiosaurus is like a man
it was also at this time of life that he met and began a relationship with tessa verney a student then studying history at ucl when they were both serving on the committee of the university college literary society
during his studies wheeler had developed his love of archaeology having joined an excavation of viroconium cornoviorum a romano @-@ british settlement in wroxeter in <year>
considering a profession in the discipline he won a studentship that had been established jointly by the university of london and the society of antiquaries in memory of augustus wollaston franks
the prominent archaeologist sir arthur evans doubled the amount of money that went with the studentship
wheeler 's proposed project had been to analyse romano @-@ rhenish pottery and with the grant he funded a trip to the rhineland in germany there studying the roman pottery housed in local museums his research into this subject was never published
at this period there were very few jobs available within british archaeology as the later archaeologist stuart piggott related the young wheeler was looking for a professional job where the profession had yet to be created
in <year> wheeler secured a position as junior investigator for the english royal commission on historical monuments who were embarking on a project to assess the state of all structures in the nation that pre @-@ dated <year>
as part of this he was first sent to stebbing in essex to assess late medieval buildings although once that was accomplished he focused on studying the romano @-@ british remains of that county
in summer <year> he married tessa in a low @-@ key secular wedding ceremony before they moved into wheeler 's parental home in herne hill
although preferring solitary to group activities wheeler found that he greatly enjoyed soldiering
for the next seven months he was posted as an instructor in the university of london officer training corps
it was during this period in january <year> that a son was born to the wheelers and named michael
michael was their only child something that was a social anomaly at the time although it is unknown if this was by choice or not
in may <year> wheeler transferred to the royal field artillery territorial force and shortly thereafter was appointed captain
in this position he was stationed at various bases across britain often bringing his wife and child with him his responsibility was as a battery commander initially of field guns and later of howitzers
in october <year> wheeler was posted to the <num> army field artillery brigade one of the royal field artillery brigades under the direct control of the general officer commanding third army
the brigade was then stationed in belgium where it had been engaged in the battle of passchendaele against german troops along the western front
there he was immediately placed in command of an artillery battery replacing a major who had been poisoned by mustard gas
being promoted to the rank of acting major he was part of the left group of artillery covering the advancing allied infantry in the battle
throughout he maintained correspondences with his wife his sister amy and his parents
after the allied victory in the battle the brigade was transferred to italy
wheeler and the brigade arrived in italy on <num> november and proceeded through the italian riviera to reach caporetto where it had been sent to bolster the italian troops against a german and austro @-@ hungarian advance
as the russian republic removed itself from the war the german army refocused its efforts on the western front and so in march <year> wheeler 's brigade was ordered to leave italy getting a train from castelfranco to vieux rouen in france
back on the western front the brigade was assigned to the <num> division again part of julian byng 's third army reaching a stable area of the front in april
here wheeler was engaged in artillery fire for several months before the british went on the offensive in august
on <num> august in between the ruined villages of achiet and sapignies he led an expedition which captured two german field guns while under heavy fire from a castle mound he was later awarded the military cross for this action
wheeler continued as part of the british forces pushing westward until the german surrender in november <year>
he was not demobilised for several months instead being stationed at pulheim in germany until march during this time he wrote up his earlier research on romano @-@ rhenish pottery making use of access to local museums before returning to london in july <year>
he returned to working for the royal commission examining and cataloguing the historic structures of essex
in doing so he produced his first publication an academic paper on colchester 's roman balkerne gate which was published in the transactions of the essex archaeological society in <year>
he soon followed this with two papers in the journal of roman studies the first offered a wider analysis of roman colchester while the latter outlined his discovery of the vaulting for the city 's temple of claudius which was destroyed by boudica 's revolt
in doing so he developed a reputation as a roman archaeologist in britain
he then submitted his research on romano @-@ rhenish pots to the university of london on the basis of which he was awarded his doctorate of letters thenceforth until his knighthood he styled himself as dr wheeler
he was unsatisfied with his job in the commission unhappy that he was receiving less pay and a lower status than he had had in the army and so began to seek out alternative employment
he obtained a post as the keeper of archaeology at the national museum of wales a job that also entailed becoming a lecturer in archaeology at the university college of south wales and monmouthshire
taking up this position he moved to cardiff with his family in august <year> although he initially disliked the city
the museum was in disarray prior to the war construction had begun on a new purpose @-@ built building to house the collections
this had ceased during the conflict and the edifice was left abandoned during cardiff 's post @-@ war economic slump
wheeler recognised that wales was very divided regionally with many welsh people having little loyalty to cardiff thus he made a point of touring the country lecturing to local societies about archaeology
according to the later archaeologist lydia c
carr the wheelers work for the cause of the museum was part of a wider cultural @-@ nationalist movement linked to growing welsh nationalism during this period for instance the welsh nationalist party plaid cymru was founded in <year>
wheeler was impatient to start excavations and in july <year> started a six @-@ week project to excavate at the roman fort of segontium accompanied by his wife he used up his holiday to oversee the project
a second season of excavation at the site followed in <year>
greatly influenced by the writings of the archaeologist augustus pitt @-@ rivers wheeler emphasised the need for a strong developed methodology when undertaking an archaeological excavation believing in the need for strategic planning or what he termed controlled discovery with clear objectives in mind for a project
further emphasising the importance of prompt publication of research results he wrote full seasonal reports for archaeologia cambrensis before publishing a full report segontium and the roman occupation of wales
wheeler was keen on training new generations of archaeologists and two of the most prominent students to excavate with him at segontium were victor nash @-@ williams and ian richmond
over the field seasons of <year> and <year> wheeler ran excavations of the roman fort of y gaer near brecon a project aided by his wife and two archaeological students nowell myres and christopher hawkes
during this project he was visited by the prominent egyptologist sir flinders petrie and his wife hilda petrie wheeler greatly admired petrie 's emphasis on strong archaeological methodologies
wheeler published the results of his excavation in the roman fort near brecon
he then began excavations at isca augusta a roman site in caerleon where he focused on revealing the roman amphitheatre
intent on attracting press attention to both raise public awareness of archaeology and attract new sources of funding he contacted the press and organised a sponsorship of the excavation by the middle @-@ market newspaper the daily mail
in doing so he emphasised the folkloric and legendary associations that the site had with king arthur
in <year> oxford university press published wheeler 's first book for a general audience prehistoric and roman wales he later expressed the opinion that it was not a good book
in <year> the director of the national museum of wales william evans hoyle resigned amid ill health
wheeler applied to take on the role of his replacement providing supportive testimonials from charles reed peers robert bosanquet and h
j
fleure
although he had no prior museum experience he was successful in his application and was appointed director
he then employed a close friend cyril fox to take on the vacated position of keeper of archaeology
wheeler 's proposed reforms included extending the institution 's reach and influence throughout wales by building affiliations with regional museums and focusing on fundraising to finance the completion of the new museum premises
he obtained a £ <num> @,@ <num> donation from the wealthy shipowner william reardon smith and appointed smith to be the museum 's treasurer and also travelled to whitehall london where he successfully urged the british treasury to provide further funding for the museum
as a result construction on the museum 's new building was able to continue and it was officially opened by king george v in <year>
he had been considering a return to london for some time and eagerly agreed taking on the post which was based at lancaster house in the st james 's area in july <year>
in wales many felt that wheeler had simply taken the directorship of the national museum to advance his own career prospects and that he had abandoned them when a better offer came along
wheeler himself disagreed believing that he had left fox at the museum as his obvious successor and that the reforms he had implemented would therefore continue
the position initially provided wheeler with an annual salary of £ <num> which resulted in a decline in living standards for his family who moved into a flat near to victoria station
tessa 's biographer l
c
carr later commented that together the wheelers professionalized the london museum
wheeler expressed his opinion that the museum had to be cleaned expurgated and catalogued in general turned from a junk shop into a tolerably rational institution
focusing on reorganising the exhibits and developing a more efficient method of cataloguing the artefacts he also authored a short guide to the collections before using the items in the museum to write three books london and the vikings london and the saxons and london and the romans
upon his arrival the treasury allocated the museum an annual budget of £ <num> @,@ <num> which wheeler deemed insufficient for its needs
in <year> wheeler persuaded them to increase that budget as he highlighted increasing visitor numbers publications and acquisitions as well as a rise in the number of educational projects
with this additional funding he was able to employ more staff and increase his own annual salary to £ <num>
soon after joining the museum wheeler was elected to the council of the society of antiquaries
through the society he became involved in the debate as to who should finance archaeological supervision of building projects in greater london his argument was that the city of london corporation should provide the funding although in <year> it was agreed that the society itself would employ a director of excavation based in lancaster house to take on the position
also involved in the largely moribund royal archaeological institute wheeler organised its relocation to lancaster house
in <year> wheeler took on an unpaid lectureship at university college london where he established a graduate diploma course on archaeology one of the first to enroll was stuart piggott
in <year> wheeler curated an exhibit at ucl on recent work in british archaeology for which he attracted much press attention
wheeler was keen to continue archaeological fieldwork outside london undertaking excavations every year from <year> to <year>
after completing his excavation of the carlaeon amphitheatre in <year> he began fieldwork at the roman settlement and temple in lydney park gloucestershire having been invited to do so by the aristocratic landowner charles bathurst
it was during these investigations that wheeler personally discovered the lydney hoard of coinage
wheeler and his wife jointly published their excavation report in <year> as report on the excavation of the prehistoric roman and post @-@ roman site in lydney park gloucestershire which piggott noted had set the pattern for all wheeler 's future excavation reports
from there wheeler was invited to direct a society of antiquaries excavation at the roman settlement of verulamium which existed on land recently acquired by the corporation of st albans
he took on this role for four seasons from <year> to <year> before leaving a fifth season of excavation under the control of the archaeologist kathleen kenyon and the architect a

g
lowther
wheeler enjoyed the opportunity to excavate at a civilian as opposed to military site and also liked its proximity to his home in london
he was particularly interested in searching for a pre @-@ roman iron age oppidum at the site noting that the existence of a nearby catuvellauni settlement was attested to in both classical texts and numismatic evidence
with wheeler focusing his attention on potential iron age evidence tessa concentrated on excavating the inside of the city walls wheeler had affairs with at least three assistants during the project
after tessa wrote two interim reports the final excavation report was finally published in <year> as verulamium a belgic and two roman cities jointly written by wheeler and his wife
the report resulted in the first major published criticism of wheeler produced by the young archaeologist nowell myres in a review for antiquity although stating that there was much to praise about the work he critiqued wheeler 's selective excavation dubious dating and guesswork
wheeler responded with a piece in which he defended his work and launched a personal attack on both myres and myres 's employer christ church oxford
he hoped that it could become a centre in which to establish the professionalisation of archaeology as a discipline with systematic training of students in methodological techniques of excavation and conservation and recognised professional standards in his words he hoped to convert archaeology into a discipline worthy of that name in all senses
he further described his intention that the institute should become a laboratory a laboratory of archaeological science
many archaeologists shared his hopes and to this end petrie had donated much of his collection of near eastern artefacts to wheeler in the hope that it would be included in such an institution
wheeler was later able to persuade the university of london a federation of institutions across the capital to support the venture and both he and tessa began raising funds from wealthy backers
in <year> the institute of archaeology was officially opened albeit at this point without premises or academic staff the first students to enroll were rachel clay and barbara parker who went on to have careers in the discipline
while wheeler – who was still keeper of the london museum – took on the role of honorary director of the institute he installed the archaeologist kathleen kenyon as secretary of the management committee describing her as a level @-@ headed person with useful experience
after ending his work at verulamium wheeler turned his attention to the late iron age hill @-@ fort of maidan castle near to dorchester dorset where he excavated for four seasons from <year> to <year>
co @-@ directed by wheeler tessa and the curator of dorset county museum charles drew the project was carried out under the joint auspices of the society of antiquaries and the dorset field club
with around <num> assistants each season the dig constituted the largest excavation that had been conducted in britain up to that point with wheeler organising weekly meetings with the press to inform them about any discoveries
his excavation report was published in <year> as maidan castle dorset
the report 's publication allowed further criticism to be voiced of wheeler 's approach and interpretations in his review of the book the archaeologist w
f
grimes criticised the highly selective nature of the excavation noting that wheeler had not asked questions regarding the socio @-@ economic issues of the community at maidan castle aspects of past societies that had come to be of increasing interest to british archaeology
over coming decades as further excavations were carried out at the site and archaeologists developed a greater knowledge of iron age britain much of wheeler 's interpretation of the site and its development was shown to be wrong in particular by the work of the archaeologist niall sharples
in <year> wheeler embarked on a visit to the near east sailing from marseilles to port said where he visited the old kingdom tombs of sakkara
from there he went via sinai to palestine lebanon and syria
during this trip he visited various archaeological projects but was dismayed by the quality of their excavations in particular he noted that the american @-@ run excavation at tel megiddo was adopting standards that had been rejected in britain twenty @-@ five years previously
he was away for six weeks and upon his return to europe discovered that his wife tessa had died of a pulmonary embolism after a minor operation on her toe
according to tessa 's biographer for wheeler this discovery was the peak of mental misery and marked the end of his ability to feel a certain kind of love
that winter his father also died
by the summer of <year> he had embarked on a new romance with a young woman named mavis de vere cole who had first met wheeler when visiting the maidan castle excavations with her then @-@ lover the painter augustus john
after she eventually agreed to his repeated requests for marriage the two were wedded early in <year> in a ceremony held at caxton hall with a reception at shelley house
they proceeded on a honeymoon to the middle east
after a search that had taken several years wheeler was able to secure a premises for the institute of archaeology st
john 's lodge in regent 's park central london
left empty since its use as a hospital during the first world war the building was owned by the crown and was controlled by the first commissioner of works william ormsby @-@ gore he was very sympathetic to archaeology and leased the building to the institute at a low rent
the st
john 's lodge premises were officially opened on <num> april <year>
during his speech at the ceremony the university of london 's vice @-@ chancellor charles reed peers made it clear that the building was only intended as a temporary home for the institute which it was hoped would be able to move to bloomsbury the city 's academic hub
in his speech the university 's chancellor alexander cambridge 1st earl of athlone compared the new institution to both the institute of historical research and the courtauld institute of art
wheeler had also become president of the museums association and in a presidential address given in belfast talked on the topic of preserving museum collections in war time believing that britain 's involvement in a second european conflict was imminent
in anticipation of this event in august <year> he arranged for the london museum to place many of its most important collections into safe keeping
he was also awarded an honorary doctorate from bristol university and at the award ceremony met the conservative party politician winston churchill who was then engaged in writing his multi @-@ volume a history of the english @-@ speaking peoples churchill asked wheeler to aid him in writing about late prehistoric and early medieval britain to which the latter agreed
after maidan castle wheeler turned his attention to france where the archaeological investigation of iron age sites had lagged behind developments in britain
there he oversaw a series of surveys and excavations with the aid of leslie scott beginning with a survey tour of brittany in the winter of <year> – <num>
after this wheeler decided to excavate the oppidum at camp d 'artus near huelgoat finistère
in addition to bringing many british archaeologists to work on the site he hired six local breton workmen to assist the project coming to the belief that the oppidum had been erected by local iron age tribes to defend themselves from the roman invasion led by julius caesar
meanwhile scott had been placed in charge of an excavation at the smaller nearby hill fort of kercaradec near quimper
in july <year> the project focused its attention on normandy with excavations beginning at the iron age hill forts of camp de canada and duclair
they were brought to an abrupt halt in september <year> as the second world war broke out in europe and the team evacuated back to britain
wheeler 's excavation report co @-@ written with katherine richardson was eventually published as hill @-@ forts of northern france in <year>
volunteering for the armed services he was assigned to assemble the <num> light anti @-@ aircraft battery at enfield where he set about recruiting volunteers including his son
as the <num> swelled in size it was converted into the <num> mobile light anti @-@ aircraft regiment in the royal artillery which consisted of four batteries and was led by wheeler – now promoted to the rank of colonel – as commanding officer
given the nickname of flash alf by those serving under him he was recognised by colleagues as a ruthless disciplinarian and was blamed by many for the death of one of his soldiers from influenza during training
having been appointed secretary of the society of antiquaries in <year> and then director in <year> he travelled to london to deal with society affairs on various occasions
in <year> wheeler was awarded a fellowship of the british academy
cole had meanwhile entered into an affair with a man named clive entwistle who lambasted wheeler as that whiskered baboon
when wheeler discovered entwistle in bed with his wife he initiated divorce proceedings that were finalised in march <year>
in the summer of <year> wheeler and three of his batteries were assigned to fight against german and italian forces in the north african campaign
in september they set sail from glasgow aboard the rms empress of russia because the mediterranean was controlled largely by enemy naval forces they were forced to travel via the cape of good hope before taking shore leave in durban
there wheeler visited the local kraals to compare them with the settlements of iron age britain
the ship docked in aden where wheeler and his men again took shore leave
they soon reached the british @-@ controlled suez where they disembarked and were stationed on the shores of the great bitter lake
there wheeler took a brief leave of absence to travel to jerusalem where he visited petrie on his hospital deathbed
back in egypt he gained permission to fly as a front gunner in a wellington bomber on a bombing raid against axis forces to better understand what it was like for aircrew to be fired on by an anti @-@ aircraft battery
serving with the eighth army wheeler was present in north africa when the axis armies pushed the allies back to el alamein
he was also part of the allied counter @-@ push taking part in the second battle of el alamein and the advance on axis @-@ held tripoli
on the way he became concerned that the archaeological sites of north africa were being threatened both by the fighting and the occupying forces
after the british secured control of libya wheeler visited tripoli and leptis magna where he found that roman remains had been damaged and vandalised by british troops he brought about reforms to prevent this lecturing to the troops on the importance of preserving archaeology making many monuments out @-@ of @-@ bounds and ensuring that the royal air force changed its plans to construct a radar station in the midst of a roman settlement
aware that the british were planning to invade and occupy the italian island of sicily he insisted that measures be introduced to preserve the historic and archaeological monuments on the island
promoted to the rank of brigadier after the german surrender in north africa wheeler was sent to algiers where he was part of the staff committee planning the invasion of italy
there he learned that the india office had requested that the army relieve him of his duties to permit him to be appointed director general of archaeology in india
although he had never been to the country he agreed that he would take the job on the condition that he be permitted to take part in the invasion of italy first
as intended wheeler and his <num> anti @-@ aircraft brigade then took part in the invasion of sicily and then mainland italy where they were ordered to use their anti @-@ aircraft guns to protect the british <num> corps
as the allies advanced north through italy wheeler spent time in naples and then capri where he met various aristocrats who had anti @-@ fascist sympathies
wheeler left italy in november <year> and returned to london
there he resigned as the director of the london museum and focused on organising the institute of archaeology preparing it for its adoption of a new director v
gordon childe after the war
he also resigned as director of the society of antiquaries but was appointed the group 's representative to the newly formed council for british archaeology
he developed a relationship with a woman named kim collingridge and asked her to marry him
as she was a devout roman catholic he officially converted to the religion something which shocked many of his friends who believed that he was being dishonest because he did not genuinely believe in the doctrines of the faith
he then set sail for bombay aboard a transport ship the city of exeter in february <year>
there he was welcomed by the city 's governor john colville before heading by train to delhi and then simla where the headquarters of the archaeological survey of india were located
wheeler had been suggested for the job by archibald wavell the viceroy of india who had been acting on the recommendations of the archaeologist leonard woolley who had authored a report lamenting the state of the archaeological establishment in the british @-@ controlled subcontinent
wheeler recognised this state of affairs in a letter to a friend complaining about the lack of finances and equipment commenting that we 're back in <year>
he initially found much to dislike in india and in his letters to friends in britain expressed derogatory and racist sentiments toward indians he stated that they feed wrongly and think wrongly and live wrongly
i already find myself regarding them as ill @-@ made clockwork toys rather than as human beings and i find myself bullying them most brutally
he expelled those staff members whom he deemed too idle and physically beat others in an attempt to motivate them
from the beginning of his tenure he sought to distance himself from previous director @-@ generals and their administrations by criticising them in print and attempting to introduce new staff who had no loyalty to his predecessors
assigned with a four @-@ year contract wheeler attempted to recruit two archaeologists from britain glyn daniel and stuart piggott to aid him in reforming the archaeological survey although they declined the offer
he then toured the subcontinent seeking to meet all of the survey 's staff members
he had drawn up a prospectus containing research questions that he wanted the survey to focus on these included understanding the period between the bronze age indus valley civilization and the achaemenid empire discerning the socio @-@ cultural background to the vedas dating the aryan invasion and establishing a dating system for southern india prior to the sixth century ce
during his time in office he also achieved a <num> per cent budget increase for the archaeological survey and convinced the government to agree to the construction of a national museum of archaeology to be built in new delhi
in october <year> he opened his six @-@ month archaeological field school in taxila where he instructed various students from across india in the methodologies of the discipline
wheeler became very fond of his students with one of them b
b
lal later commenting that behind the gruff exterior sir mortimer had a very kind and sympathetic heart
throughout his period in india his students were some of the only individuals to whom wheeler warmed more widely he was annoyed by what he saw as the idleness incompetence and corruption of indian society
initially focusing on the northwest of the subcontinent wheeler was particularly fascinated by the bronze age indus valley civilization
on his initial inspection of the indus valley sites of mohenjo @-@ daro and harappa he organised a very brief excavation which revealed fortifications around both settlements
he later led a more detailed excavation at harappa where he exposed further fortifications and established a stratigraphy for the settlement
turning his attention to southern india wheeler discovered remnants of a roman amphora in a museum and began excavations at arikamedu revealing a port from the first century ce which had traded in goods from the roman empire
the excavation had been plagued by severe rains and tropical heat although it was during the excavation that world war ii ended in celebration wheeler gave all his workers an extra rupee for the day
it has since been alleged that while wheeler took credit for discovering the significance of this site it had previously been established by a
aiyappan the superintendent of the government museum in madras and the french archaeologist jouveau dubreuil with wheeler intentionally ignoring their contribution
he later undertook excavations of six megalithic tombs in brahmagiri mysore which enabled him to gain a chronology for the archaeology of much of southern india
wheeler established a new archaeological journal ancient india planning for it to be published twice a year
he had trouble securing printing paper and faced various delays the first issue was released in january <year> and he would release three further volumes during his stay
wheeler married kim collingridge in simla before he and his wife took part in an indian cultural mission to iran
the indian government had deemed wheeler ideal to lead the group which departed via train to zahidan before visiting persepolis tehran isfahan shiraz pasargadae and kashan
wheeler enjoyed the trip and was envious of tehran 's archaeological museum and library which was far in advance of anything then found in india
crossing into iraq in baghdad the team caught a flight back to delhi
in <year> he was involved in a second cultural mission this time to afghanistan where he expressed a particular interest in the kingdom of ancient bactria and visited the archaeology of balkh
wheeler was present during the <year> partition of india into the dominion of pakistan and the union of india and the accompanying ethnic violence between hindu and muslim communities
he was unhappy with how these events had affected the archaeological survey complaining that some of his finest students and staff were now citizens of pakistan and no longer able to work for him
he was based in new delhi when the city was rocked by sectarian violence and attempted to help many of his muslim staff members escape from the hindu @-@ majority city unharmed
he further helped smuggle muslim families out of the city hospital where they had taken refuge from a violent hindu mob
as india neared independence from the british empire the political situation had changed significantly by october <year> he was one of the last british individuals in a high @-@ up position within the country 's governing establishment and recognised that many indian nationalists wanted him to also leave
as their relationship had become increasingly strained his wife had left and returned to britain
although hoping to leave his post in india several months early he was concerned for his economic prospects and desperately searched for a new job position
through friends in the british archaeological community he was offered a job as the secretary of the royal commission on ancient monuments for wales although he was upset that this would mean a drop in his professional status and income and decided to turn it down
instead he agreed to take up a chair in the archaeology of the roman provinces at the institute of archaeology
in addition the pakistani minister of education invited him to become the archaeological adviser to the pakistani government he agreed to also take up this position on the condition that he would only spend several months in the country each year over the next three
wheeler and the latter disliked each other and so in summer <year> he moved out and began renting an apartment in mount street
a year later he moved into his wife 's house in mallord street in an unsuccessful hope of reigniting their relationship
taking up his part @-@ time professorship at the institute of archaeology he began to lecture to students almost every day
there he found that he developed a relationship of mutual respect with the director childe despite their strong personal and professional differences
in april <year> after the retirement of cyril fox wheeler was nominated for the presidency of the society of antiquaries but lost to james mann many archaeologists including childe and o
g
s
crawford resigned from the society in protest deeming wheeler to have been a far more appropriate candidate for the position
wheeler was nevertheless elected director of the society
in <year> he was awarded the petrie medal and in <year> was knighted
that same year he was invited to give the norton lectures for the archaeological institute of america and while in the united states was also awarded the lucy wharton drexel medal at pennsylvania
he nevertheless disliked the country and in later life exhibited anti @-@ americanism
wheeler spent three months in pakistan during early <year> where he was engaged in organising the fledgling pakistani archaeological department with the aid of former members of the archaeological survey and new students whom he recruited
the minister of education fazlur rahman was sympathetic to wheeler 's plans and the government agreed to establish a national museum of pakistan in karachi which opened in april <year>
wheeler himself was appointed the first president of the pakistani museums association and found himself as a mediator in the arguments between india and pakistan over the redistribution of archaeological and historic artefacts following the partition
he also wrote a work of archaeological propaganda for the newly formed state five thousand years of pakistan <year>
to instruct new pakistani students in the methods of archaeology in early <year> wheeler ran a training excavation at mohenjo @-@ daro there he was joined by the british student leslie alcock who spoke both punjabi and urdu and who was appointed a site supervisor by wheeler
this excavation proved to be the only one for which wheeler would not write and publish a full excavation report
instead he made reference to its findings in his book the indus civilization published as part of the series the cambridge history of india
his relationship with the pakistani government had become strained and so he declined to return to work for them for a third year
wheeler had been keen to return to excavation in britain
based on the one he had organised in india wheeler developed an archaeological training course which he ran at verulamium in the summer of <year> to instruct british students in the methodologies of excavation
in summer <year> he was invited by the royal commission on historical monuments to direct a trial excavation at bindon hill in dorset
it was a leisurely project which he treated as a seaside holiday
he was invited by the ancient monuments department of the ministry of works to excavate the stanwick iron age fortifications in north riding yorkshire which he proceeded to do over the summers of <year> and <year>
aided by many old friends and colleagues from within the british archaeological scene he was joined by alcock and alcock 's wife among others
wheeler published his report on the site in <year>
in <year> wheeler was appointed honorary secretary of the british academy after frederic g
kenyon stepped down from the position
according to piggott the institution had unhappily drifted into senility without the excuse of being venerable and wheeler devoted much time attempting to revitalise the organisation and ensured that charles webster was appointed president
together wheeler and webster sought to increase the number of younger members of the academy increasing the number of fellows who were permitted to join and proposing that those over <num> years of age not be permitted to serve on the organisation 's council this latter measure was highly controversial and though defeated in <year> wheeler and webster were able to push it through in <year>
in doing so piggott stated wheeler helped rid the society of its self @-@ perpetuating gerontocracy
to aid him in these projects wheeler employed a personal assistant molly myers who remained with him for the rest of his life
childe was also retiring from his position of director that year and wheeler involved himself in the arguments surrounding who should replace him
wheeler vocally opposed the nomination of w
f
grimes deeming his career undistinguished instead he championed glyn daniel as a candidate although ultimately grimes was selected
that year wheeler 's marriage broke down and he moved from his wife 's house to a former brothel at <num> whitcomb street in central london
from <year> to <year> he served as the president of the society of antiquaries and after resigning supported ian richmond as his replacement however joan evans was selected
from <year> to <year> he served as chairman of the ancient monuments board stepping down when he concluded that he was too old for the role
in december <year> wheeler underwent a prostate operation that went wrong and was hospitalised for over a month
in november <year> wheeler became a companion of honour and in <year> he became a fellow of the royal society
in <year> wheeler was invited to be a panelist on the new bbc television series animal vegetable mineral
based on the american quiz programme what in the world the show was hosted by glyn daniel and featured three experts in archaeology anthropology and natural history being asked to identify artefacts which had been selected from various museums
however wheeler is alleged to have prepared for the show by checking beforehand which objects had been temporarily removed from display
the show proved popular with british audiences and would air for six more years
it brought wheeler to public attention resulting in a television personality of the year award for him in <year>
he also appeared in an episode of buried treasure an archaeology show also hosted by daniel in which the pair travelled to denmark to discuss tollund man
in <year> he appeared in a second episode of buried treasure for which he travelled to pakistan to discuss that nation 's archaeology and in <year> again appeared in an episode this time on the site of great zimbabwe in southern rhodesia
in <year> he presented his own three @-@ part series on the grandeur that was rome for which he travelled to hadrian 's wall pompeii and leptis magna the show failed to secure high ratings and was wheeler 's last major foray into television
meanwhile he also made appearances on bbc radio initially featuring on the john irving series the archaeologist but later presenting his own eight @-@ part series on roman britain and also appearing on the series asian club which was aimed primarily at newly arrived migrants from the indian subcontinent
from <year> onward wheeler began to devote an increasing amount of his time to encouraging greater public interest in archaeology and it was in that year that he obtained an agent
oxford university press also published two of his books in <year>
the first was a book on archaeological methodologies archaeology from the earth which was translated into various languages
the second was rome beyond the imperial frontier discussing evidence for roman activity at sites like arikamedu and segontium
in <year> wheeler released his episodic autobiography still digging which had sold over <num> @,@ <num> copies by the end of the year
in <year> wheeler wrote early india and pakistan which was published as part as daniel 's ancient peoples and places series for thames and hudson as with many earlier books he was criticised for rushing to conclusions
he authored the section entitled ancient india for piggott 's edited volume the dawn of civilisation which was published by thames and hudson in <year> before writing an introduction for roger wood 's photography book roman africa in colour which was also published by thames and hudson
he then agreed to edit a series for the publisher known as new aspects of antiquity through which they released a variety of archaeological works
the rival publisher weidenfeld nicolson had also persuaded wheeler to work for them securing him to write many sections of their book splendours of the east
they also published his <year> book flames over persopolis in which wheeler discussed persopolis and the persian empire in the year that it was conquered by alexander the great
in <year> the tour company r
k
swan invited wheeler to provide lectures on the archaeology of ancient greece aboard their hellenic cruise line which he did in <year>
in <year> he then gave a guided tour of the archaeology of the indian subcontinent for the rival tour company fairways and swinford
after swans appointed him to the position of chairman of their hellenic cruise division he made two fortnight tours a year in spring and summer
in late <year> he conducted the swans tour to the indian subcontinent visiting the south and east of the republic as well as ceylon
during this period wheeler had kept in contact with many of his friends and colleagues in india and pakistan helping to secure them work and funding where possible
wheeler had continued his archaeological investigations and in <year> led an expedition to the somme and pas de calais where he sought to obtain more information on the french iron age to supplement that gathered in the late <num>
pakistan 's ministry of education invited wheeler to return to their country in october <year>
here he undertook test excavations at charsada to determine a chronology of the site
in <year> he agreed to take on the position of president of the camelot research committee which had been established to promote the findings of excavations at cadbury castle in somerset run by his friends ralegh radford and alcock the project ended in <year>
he also agreed to sit as chairman of the archaeological committee overseeing excavations at york minster work which occupied him into the <num>
wheeler had also continued his work with museums campaigning for greater state funding for them
while he had become a trustee of the institution in <year> he achieved publicity for vocally criticising the british museum as a mountainous corpse lambasting it as being poorly managed and overcrowded with artefacts
the bbc staged a public debate with the museum director frank francis
he developed personal relationships with various employees at the british treasury and offered the academy 's services as an intermediary in dealing with the egypt exploration society the british school at athens the british school at rome the british school at ankara the british school in iraq and the british school at jerusalem all of which were then directly funded independently by the treasury
accepting this offer the treasury agreed to double its funding of the academy to £ <num> @,@ <num> a year
approaching various charitable foundations from <year> wheeler also secured funding from both the pilgrim trust and the nuffield foundation and in <year> then secured additional funding from the rockefeller foundation
with this additional money the academy was able to organise a survey of the state of the humanities and social sciences in the united kingdom authoring a report that was published by oxford university press in <year> as research in the humanities and the social sciences
on the basis of this report wheeler was able to secure a dramatic rise in funding from the british treasury they increased their annual grant to £ <num> @,@ <num> and promised that this would increase to £ <num> @,@ <num> shortly after
according to his later biographer jacquetta hawkes in doing so wheeler raised the position of the academy to that of the main source of official patronage for the humanities within the united kingdom while piggott stated that he set the organisation upon its modern course
to improve britain 's cultural influence abroad wheeler had been urging the establishment of a british institute of history and archaeology in east africa touring east africa itself in august <year>
in <year> the academy requested £ <num> @,@ <num> from the treasury to fund this new institution to which they eventually agreed in <year>
the institute was initially established in dar es salaam in <year> although later relocated to nairobi
meanwhile wheeler had also been campaigning for the establishment of a british institute of persian studies a project which was supported by the british embassy in tehran they hoped that it would rival the successful french institute in the city
in <year> the treasury agreed with the new institution being housed on the premises of the university of tehran
he further campaigned for the establishment of a british institute in japan although these ideas were scrapped amid the british financial crisis of <year>
wheeler retained an active interest in the running of these british institutions abroad in <year> he visited the british school in jerusalem amid the six @-@ day war between israel and its arab neighbours and in january <year> visited the persian institute with the archaeologist max mallowan and mallowan 's wife agatha christie there inspecting the excavations at siraf
in <year> he proceeded to the italian city of rome to inspect the british school there
that year he resigned as honorary secretary of the academy
the position became a salaried professional one with the numismatist derek allen taking on the position
recognising his stature within the archaeological establishment the government appointed wheeler as the british representative on a unesco project to undertake a programme of rescue archaeology in the nile valley ahead of the construction of the aswan dam which was going to flood large areas of egypt and sudan
personally securing uk funding for the project he deemed it an issue of national and personal shame when he was unable to persuade the british government to supply additional funding for the relocation of the abu simbel temples
in october <year> he took part in a unesco visit to pakistan to assess the state of mohenjo @-@ daro writing the project 's report on how the archaeological site could best be preserved
his involvement with unesco continued for the rest of his life and in march <year> he was invited to the organisation 's conference in paris
in march <year> the archaeologist barry cunliffe and a number of his undergraduate students at the university of southampton organised a conference on the subject of the iron age and its hillforts to celebrate wheeler 's eightieth birthday
wheeler attended the event whose conference proceedings were published as a festschrift for the octogenarian
in spring <year> wheeler returned to bbc television for two episodes of the archaeology @-@ themed series chronicle in which he discussed his life and career
the episodes were well received and wheeler became a close friend of the show 's producer david collison
in the <num> wheeler became increasingly forgetful and came to rely largely on his assistant molly myres to organise his affairs
amid increasing ill health in september <year> he moved full @-@ time into myres 's house in leatherhead surrey although he continued to use his central london flat during day @-@ trips to the city
there he authored a final book my archaeological mission to india and pakistan although much of the text was culled from his previous publications it was published by thames and hudson in <year>
after suffering a stroke wheeler died at myers home on <num> july <year>
in memoriam the british academy royal academy and royal society flew their flags at half @-@ mast
wheeler 's funeral was held with military trappings at a local crematorium while a larger memorial service was held in st james 's church piccadilly in november
he divided opinion among those who knew him with some loving and others despising him and during his lifetime he was often criticised on both scholarly and moral grounds
the archaeologist max mallowan asserted that he was a delightful light @-@ hearted and amusing companion but those close to him knew that he could be a dangerous opponent if threatened with frustration
his charm offensives were often condemned as being insincere
during excavations he was known as an authoritarian leader but favoured those whom he thought exhibited bravery by standing up to his authority
hence he has been termed a benevolent dictator
he was meticulous in his writings and would repeatedly revise and rewrite both pieces for publication and personal letters
throughout his life he was a heavy smoker
wheeler expressed the view that he was the least political of mortals
despite not taking a strong interest in politics wheeler was described by his biographer as a natural conservative for instance during his youth he was strongly critical of the suffragettes and their cause of greater legal rights for women
nevertheless he was usually happy to advance young women professionally something that may have been based largely on his sexual attraction toward them
he expressed little interest in his relatives in later life he saw no reason to have a social relationship with people purely on the basis of family ties
wheeler was married three times
in may <year> wheeler married tessa verney
tessa became an accomplished archaeologist and they collaborated until she died in <year>
their only child a son michael was born in january <year> he became a barrister
following tessa 's death in <year> wheeler married mavis de vere cole although their relationship was strained cole 's diaries revealed that wheeler physically hit her when she annoyed him
in <year> mortimer wheeler married his third wife margaret kim collingridge although they became estranged in <year> they never divorced as a result of her devout catholicism
meanwhile wheeler was well known for his conspicuous promiscuity favouring young women for one night stands many of whom were his students
he was further known for having casual sex in public places
this behaviour led to much emotional suffering among his various wives and mistresses of which he was aware
as a result of this behaviour later archaeologist gabriel moshenska informed a reporter from the daily mail that wheeler had developed a reputation as a bit of a groper and a sex pest and an incredible bully as well
highlighting his key role in encouraging interest in archaeology throughout british society they stated that his mastery of public archaeology was founded on his keen eye for value and a showman 's willingness to package and sell the past
this was an issue about which wheeler felt very strongly writing his obituary for the biographical memoirs of fellows of the royal society the english archaeologist stuart piggott noted that wheeler placed great importance to the archaeologist 's obligation to the public on whose support the prosecution of his subject ultimately depended
piggott believed that wheeler 's greatest impact was as the great innovator in field techniques comparing him in this respect to pitt @-@ rivers
piggott stated that the importance of wheeler 's contribution to archaeological technique enormous and far @-@ reaching lies in the fact that in the early <num> he not only appreciated and understood what pitt @-@ rivers had done but saw that his work could be used as a basis for adaptation development and improvement
l
c
carr stated that it was for his methodological developments oft termed the wheeler method that wheeler was best known in this she contrasted him with those archaeologists who were best known for their associations with a specific archaeological site such as arthur evans and knossos or leonard woolley and ur
wheeler was well known for his publications on archaeological matters carr stated that both wheeler and his first wife emphasised technical rigour and a full presentation of materials unearthed as well as a literary discussion of their meaning calculated to appeal to a larger audience
focusing on wheeler 's publications regarding south asian archaeology sudeshna guha noted that he produced an assemblage of image @-@ objects that embodied the precision he demanded from excavation photography
mallowan noted that immediate and swift presentation of results was more important to him than profound scholarship although his critical sense made him conscious that it was necessary to maintain high standards and he would approve of nothing that was slipshod
jacquetta hawkes commented that he made errors in his interpretation of the archaeological evidence because he was sometimes too sure of being right too ready to accept his own authority
she asserted that while wheeler was not an original thinker he had a vision of human history that enabled him to see each discovery of its traces however small in its widest significance
piggott claimed that wheeler 's appointment as director @-@ general of the archaeological survey of india represented the most remarkable archaeological achievement of his career an enormous challenge accepted and surmounted in the autocratic and authoritarian terms within which he could best deploy his powers as administrator and excavator
no other archaeologist of the time it seems fair to remark could have come near to attaining his command of incisive strategy and often ruthless tactics which won him the bewildered admiration and touching devotion of his indian staff
the indian archaeologist dilip k
chakrabarti later stated that wheeler 's accomplishments while in india were considerable particularly given the socio @-@ political turmoil of independence and partition
chakrabarti stated that wheeler had contributed to south asian archaeology in various ways by establishing a total view of the region 's development from the palaeolithic onward by introducing new archaeological techniques and methodologies to the subcontinent and by encouraging indian universities to begin archaeological research
ultimately chakrabarti was of the opinion that wheeler had prepared the archaeology of the subcontinent for its transition to modernity in the post @-@ partition period
similarly peter johansen praised wheeler for systematising and professionalising indian archaeology and for instituting a clearly defined body of techniques and methods for field and laboratory work and training
on wheeler 's death h
d
sankalia of deccan college pune described him as well known among old world archaeologists in the united states particularly for his book archaeology from the earth and his studies of the indus valley civilisation
in its <year> obituary of the english archaeologist mick aston british archaeology magazine – the publication of the council for british archaeology – described aston as the mortimer wheeler of our times because despite the strong differences between their personalities both had done much to bring archaeology to the british public
however writing in <year> moshenska and schadla @-@ hall asserted that wheeler 's reputation has not undergone significant revision among archaeologists but that instead he had come to be remembered as a cartoonish and slightly eccentric figure whom they termed naughty morty
carr described the institute of archaeology as one of the wheeler couple 's most permanent memorials
fitzroy somerset <num> baron raglan reviewed the volume for the journal man describing this very readable little book as being adulatory in tone but hardly more so than its subject deserves
in <year> the archaeologist jacquetta hawkes published a second biography mortimer wheeler adventurer in archaeology
hawkes admitted she had developed a very great liking for wheeler having first met him when she was an archaeology student at the university of cambridge
she believed that he had a daemonic energy with his accomplishments in india being almost superhuman
ultimately she thought of him as being an epic hero in an anti @-@ heroic age in which growing social egalitarianism had stifled and condemned aspects of his greatness
in the <year> film hey ram the lead character saket ram played by kamal haasan and his friend amjad khan played by shah rukh khan are shown as employees of wheeler who was portrayed by lewis k
elbinger before the <year> hindu @-@ muslim riots
in a <year> volume of the south asian studies journal sudeshna gusha published a research article examining wheeler 's use of photography in his excavations and publications in the indian subcontinent
in <year> the academic journal public archaeology published a research paper by moshenska and schadla @-@ hall that analysed wheeler 's role in presenting archaeology to the british public
two years later the papers from the institute of archaeology issued a short comic strip by moshenska and alex salamunovich depicting wheeler 's activities in studying the archaeology of libya during world war ii
allosaurus was originally described from material from the upper jurassic morrison formation of the western united states of america the type species a
fragilis became one of the best @-@ known species of dinosaur
the genus allosaurus was part of the marsh cope bone wars of the late <num> century and its taxonomy became increasingly confused due to the competition with several genera and species named by cope and marsh now regarded as synonyms of allosaurus or a
fragilis
since the description of allosaurus scientists have proposed additional species from such far @-@ flung locales as portugal siberia and tanzania
because of this several scientists have noted that the type specimen and thus the genus allosaurus itself or at least the species a
fragillis is technically a nomen dubium dubious name based on a specimen too incomplete to compare to other specimens or to classify
in an attempt to fix this situation gregory s
paul and kenneth carpenter <year> submitted a petition to the iczn to have the name a
fragillis officially transferred to the more complete specimen usnm4734 as a neotype
this request is currently pending review
eight species have been considered potentially valid since <year> a
amplexus a
atrox a
europaeus the type species a
fragilis the as @-@ yet not formally described a
jimmadseni a
lucasi a
maximus and a
tendagurensis although only about half are usually considered valid at any given time
there are also at least ten dubious or undescribed species that have been assigned to allosaurus over the years along with the species belonging to genera now sunk into allosaurus
in the most recent review of basal tetanuran theropods only a
fragilis including a
amplexus and a
atrox a
jimmadseni as an unnamed species and a
tendagurensis were accepted as potentially valid species with a
europaeus not yet proposed and a
maximus assigned to saurophaganax
a
fragilis is the type species and was named by marsh in <year>
it is known from the remains of at least sixty individuals all found in the kimmeridgian – tithonian upper jurassic @-@ age morrison formation of the united states spread across the states of colorado montana new mexico oklahoma south dakota utah and wyoming
details of the humerus upper arm of a
fragilis have been used as diagnostic among morrison theropods but the discovery of a
jimmadseni indicates that this will no longer be the case at the species level
a
amplexus was named by gregory s
paul for giant morrison allosaur remains and included in his conception saurophagus maximus later saurophaganax
a
amplexus was originally coined by cope in <year> as the type species of his new genus epanterias and is based on what is now amnh <num> parts of three vertebrae a coracoid and a metatarsal
following paul 's work this species has been accepted as a synonym of a
fragilis
allosaurus material from portugal was first reported in <year> on the basis of mhnul and
<num> a partial skeleton including a quadrate vertebrae ribs gastralia chevrons part of the hips and hindlimbs
this specimen was assigned to a
fragilis but the subsequent discovery of a partial skull and neck ml <num> near lourinhã in the kimmeridgian @-@ age porto novo member of the lourinhã formation spurred the naming of the new species a
europaeus
it differs from other species of allosaurus in cranial details
however more material may show it to be a
fragilis as originally described
daniel chure 's work on morrison allosaurid remains has been responsible directly or indirectly for a
jimmadseni and a
maximus
a
jimmadseni is the proposed name for a new species of morrison allosaur based on a nearly complete skeleton and skull
a
sp
<num> as it is also known differs from a
fragilis in several anatomical details including a jugal or cheekbone with a straight lower margin and is also found only in the salt wash member of the morrison formation with a
fragilis only present in the higher brushy basin member
a
maximus was coined by david k
smith for chure 's saurophaganax maximus a taxon created by chure in <year> for giant allosaurid remains from the morrison of oklahoma
these remains had been known as saurophagus but that name was already in use leading chure to propose a substitute
smith in his <year> analysis of variation concluded that s
maximus was not different enough from allosaurus to be a separate genus but did warrant its own species a
maximus
this reassignment was rejected in the most recent review of basal tetanurans
atrox and a
paul 's <year> book predatory dinosaurs of the world
paul proposed that a
fragilis had tall pointed horns and a slender build compared to a postulated second species a
atrox and was not a different gender due to rarity
allosaurus atrox was originally named by marsh in <year> as the type species of its own genus creosaurus and is based on ypm <year> an assortment of bones including a couple of pieces of the skull portions of nine tail vertebrae two hip vertebrae an illium and ankle and foot bones
although the idea of two common morrison allosaur species has had support in semi @-@ technical and popular works it has generally been rejected in the technical literature
david k
smith examining allosaurus fossils by quarry found that the cleveland lloyd dinosaur quarry utah specimens are generally smaller than those from como bluff wyoming or brigham young university 's dry mesa quarry colorado but the shapes of the bones themselves did not vary between the sites
a later study by smith incorporating garden park colorado and dinosaur national monument utah specimens found no justification for multiple species based on skeletal variation skull variation was most common and was gradational suggesting individual variation was responsible
further work on size @-@ related variation again found no consistent differences although the dry mesa material tended to clump together on the basis of the astragalus an ankle bone
kenneth carpenter using skull elements from the cleveland lloyd site found wide variation between individuals calling into question previous species @-@ level distinctions based such features as the shape of the horns and the proposed differentiation of a
jimmadseni based on the shape of the jugal
species a
agilis seen in zittel <year> and osborn <year> is a typographical error for a
fragilis
marsh 's a
ferox <year> not to be confused with his <year> labrosaurus ferox also part of allosaurus taxonomy was coined for a partial skull in a footnote and has been recognized as a specimen of a fragilis
a
lucaris another marsh name was given to a partial skeleton in <year>
he later decided it warranted its own genus labrosaurus but this has not been accepted and a
lucaris is also regarded as another specimen of a
fragilis
allosaurus lucaris is known mostly from vertebrae sharing characters with allosaurus
paul and carpenter stated that the type specimen of this species ypm <year> was from a younger age than allosaurus and might represent a different genus
however they found that the specimen was undiagnostic and thus a
lucaris was a nomen dubium
a
whitei an informally described species coined by pickering in <year> is a recasting of the a
atrox versus a
fragilis debate using a better specimen to represent the a
atrox form and has not been recognized
several species coined in genera other than allosaurus are also now thought to be synonymous with a
fragilis
labrosaurus ferox was named in <year> by marsh for an oddly formed partial lower jaw with a prominent gap in the tooth row at the tip of the jaw and a rear section greatly expanded and turned down
later researchers suggested that the bone was pathologic showing an injury to the living animal and that part of the unusual form of the rear of the bone was due to plaster reconstruction
it is recognized as most likely a specimen of a
fragilis
allosaurus valens is a typo for antrodemus valens accidentally used by friedrich von huene in <year> antrodemus valens itself may also pertain to allosaurus fragilis as gilmore suggested in <year>
apatodon mirus based on a scrap of vertebra marsh first thought to be a mammalian jaw may or may not be the same as allosaurus
a
medius was named by marsh in <year> for various specimens from the early cretaceous of maryland although most of the remains were removed by richard swann lull to the new ornithopod species dryosaurus grandis except for a tooth
gilmore considered the tooth nondiagnostic but transferred it to a new species dryptosaurus medius
the referral was not accepted in the most recent review and allosaurus medius was simply listed as a dubious species of theropod
allosaurus sibiricus was described in <year> by a
n
riabinin on the basis of a bone later identified as a partial fourth metatarsal from the early cretaceous of buryatia russia
it was transferred to chilantaisaurus in <year>
allosaurus meriani was described in <year> by greppin as a species of megalosaurus based on a tooth from the late jurassic of switzerland
it has occasionally been referred to allosaurus but recent reviews have listed it as dubious theropod species megalosaurus meriani or included it in ceratosaurus sp
allosaurus stechowi was described in <year> by janensch as labrosaurus stechowi for isolated ceratosaurus @-@ like teeth from the tendaguru beds of tanzania
with the synonymization of labrosaurus and allosaurus donald f
glut listed it as a species of allosaurus but it is now either assigned to ceratosaurus sp
or considered a dubious ceratosaurian
there are also several species left over from the synonymizations of creosaurus and labrosaurus with allosaurus
creosaurus potens was named by lull in <year> for a vertebra from the early cretaceous of maryland
it is now regarded as a dubious theropod
labrosaurus fragilis is a typographical error by marsh <year> for labrosaurus ferox
l
sulcatus named by marsh in <year> for a morrison theropod tooth which like l
stechowi is now regarded as either ceratosaurus sp
or a dubious ceratosaurian
a
tendagurensis was named in <year> by werner janensch for a partial shin hm <num> found in the kimmeridgian @-@ age rocks of tendaguru in mtwara tanzania
this species has not had strong support in recent years with opinions on its identity ranging from a tentatively valid species of allosaurus to a basal tetanuran
the most recent analysis has placed it in carcharodontosauridae
although obscure it was a large theropod possibly around <num> meters long <num> ft and <num>
<num> metric tons <num>
<num> short tons in weight
meaning the authors found the specimens to be most like those of allosaurus but did not or could not assign a species
also reports of allosaurus in shanxi china go back to at least <year>
an astragalus ankle bone thought to belong to a species of allosaurus was found at cape paterson victoria in early cretaceous beds in southeastern australia
it was thought to provide evidence that australia was a refugium for animals that had gone extinct elsewhere
this identification was challenged by samuel welles who thought it more resembled that of an ornithomimid but the original authors defended their identification
with fifteen years of new specimens and research to look at daniel chure reexamined the bone and found that it was not allosaurus but could represent an allosauroid
similarly yoichi azuma and phil currie in their description of fukuiraptor noted that the bone closely resembled that of their new genus
this specimen is sometimes referred to as allosaurus robustus an informal museum name
it may have belonged to something similar to or the same as australovenator or it may represent an abelisaur
a speculative polar or dwarf allosaur was used for the spirits of the ice forest episode of walking with dinosaurs
young specimens resemble a puffball when young and unopened
in maturity the mushroom displays the characteristic earthstar shape that is a result of the outer layer of fruit body tissue splitting open in a star @-@ like manner
the false earthstar is an ectomycorrhizal species that grows in association with various trees especially in sandy soils
a
hygrometricus has a cosmopolitan distribution and is common in temperate and tropical regions
its common names refer to the fact that it is hygroscopic water @-@ absorbing and can open up its rays to expose the spore sac in response to increased humidity and close them up again in drier conditions
the rays have an irregularly cracked surface while the spore case is pale brown and smooth with an irregular slit or tear at the top
the gleba is white initially but turns brown and powdery when the spores mature
the spores are reddish @-@ brown roughly spherical with minute warts measuring <num>
<num> – <num> micrometers in diameter
despite a similar overall appearance a
hygrometricus is not related to the true earthstars of genus geastrum although historically they have been taxonomically confused
the species was first described by christiaan hendrik persoon in <year> as geastrum hygrometricus
in <year> andrew p
morgan proposed that differences in microscopic characteristics warranted the creation of a new genus astraeus distinct from geastrum this opinion was not universally accepted by later authorities
several asian populations formerly thought to be a
hygrometricus were renamed in the <num> once phylogenetic analyses revealed they were unique astraeus species including a
asiaticus and a
odoratus
research has revealed the presence of several bioactive chemical compounds in the fruit bodies
north american field guides typically rate a
hygrometricus as inedible
according to the american botanist andrew p
morgan however the species differed from those of geastrum in not having open chambers in the young gleba having larger and branched capillitium threads not having a true hymenium and having larger spores
accordingly morgan set persoon 's geaster hygrometricum as the type species of his new genus astraeus in <year>
despite morgan 's publication some authorities in the following decades continued to classify the species in geastrum
the new @-@ zealand based mycologist gordon herriot cunningham explicitly transferred the species back to the genus geastrum in <year> explaining the treatment of this species by certain taxonomists well illustrates the pitfalls that lie in wait for those who worship at the shrine of ontogenic classification
the only feature of those outlined in which the species differs from others of geastrum is the somewhat primitive hymenium
in the developing plant the glebal cavities are separated by tramal plates so tenuous as to be overlooked by the uncritical worker
each cavity is filled with basidia somewhat irregularly arranged in clusters like those of scleroderma and not in the definite palisade of the species which have been studied
this difference disappears as maturity is reached when plants resemble closely the fructification of any other member of the genus
the taxonomist is then unable to indicate any point of difference by which astraeus may be separated from geastrum which indicates that the name should be discarded
cunningham 's treatment was not followed by later authorities who largely considered astraeus a distinct genus
according to the taxonomical authority mycobank synonyms of astraeus hygrometricus include lycoperdon stellatus scop
<year> geastrum fibrillosum schwein
<year> geastrum stellatum scop
wettst
<year> and astraeus stellatus e
fisch
<year>
astraeus hygrometricus has been given a number of colloquial names that allude to its hygroscopic behavior including the hygrometer earthstar the hygroscopic earthstar the barometer earthstar and the water @-@ measure earthstar
the resemblance to geastrum species also known as true earthstars accounts for the common name false earthstar
the specific name is derived from the greek words ὑγρός hygros wet and μέτρον metron measure
the german mycological society selected the species as their mushroom of the year in <year>
studies in the <num> showed that several species from asian collection sites labelled under the specific epithet hygrometricus were actually considerably variable in a number of macroscopic and microscopic characteristics
molecular studies of the dna sequences of the its region of the ribosomal dna from a number of astraeus specimens from around the world have helped to clarify phylogenetic relationships within the genus
based on these results two asian hygrometricus populations have been described as new species a
asiaticus and a
odoratus synonymous with petcharat 's a
thailandicus described in <year>
preliminary dna analyses suggests that the european a
hygrometricus described by persoon is a different species than the north american version described by morgan and that the european population may be divided into two distinct phylotypes from france and from the mediterranean
a <year> study identified a japanese species previously identified as a
hygrometricus as genetically distinct it has yet to be officially named
a form of the species found in korea and japan a
hygrometricus var
koreanus was named by v
j
stanĕk in <year> it was later <year> published as a distinct species — a
koreanus — by hanns kreisel
as pointed out by fangfuk and colleagues clarification of the proper name for this taxon must await analysis of a
hygrometricus var
koreanus specimens from the type locality in north korea
hygrometricus have roughly spherical fruit bodies that typically start their development partially embedded in the substrate
a smooth whitish mycelial layer covers the fruit body and may be partially encrusted with debris
as the fruit body matures the mycelial layer tears away and the outer tissue layer the exoperidium breaks open in a star @-@ shaped stellate pattern to form <num> – <num> irregular rays
this simultaneously pushes the fruit body above ground to reveal a round spore case enclosed in a thin papery endoperidium
the rays open and close in response to levels of moisture in the environment opening up in high humidity and closing when the air is dry
this is possible because the exoperidium is made of several different layers of tissue the innermost fibrous layer is hygroscopic and curls or uncurls the entire ray as it loses or gains moisture from its surroundings
this adaptation enables the fruit body to disperse spores at times of optimum moisture and reduce evaporation during dry periods
further dry fruit bodies with the rays curled up may be readily blown about by the wind allowing them to scatter spores from the pore as they roll
the fruit body is <num> – <num> cm <num>
<num> – <num>
<num> in in diameter from tip to tip when expanded
the exoperidium is thick and the rays are typically areolate divided into small areas by cracks and crevices on the upper surface and are dark grey to black
the spore case is sessile lacking a stalk light gray to tan color and <num> to <num> cm <num>
<num> to <num>
<num> in broad with a felt @-@ like or scurfy coated with loose scaly crust surface the top of the spore case is opened by an irregular slit tear or pore
the interior of the spore case the gleba is white and solid when young and divided into oval locules — a characteristic that helps to distinguish it from geastrum
the gleba becomes brown and powdery as the specimen matures
small dark hairlike threads rhizomorphs extend from the base of the fruit body into the substrate
the rhizomorphs are fragile and often break off after maturity
the spores are spherical or nearly so reddish @-@ brown thick @-@ walled and verrucose covered with warts and spines
the spores dimensions are <num> – <num> µm the warts are about <num> µm long
the spores are non @-@ amyloid and will not stain with iodine from melzer 's reagent
the use of scanning electron microscopy has shown that the spines are <num>
<num> – <num>
<num> µm long rounded at the tip narrow tapered and sometime joined together at the top
the capillitia masses of thread @-@ like sterile fibers dispersed among the spores are branched <num>
<num> – <num>
<num> µm in diameter and hyaline translucent
the basidia spore @-@ bearing cells are four- to eight @-@ spored with very short sterigmata
the basidia are arranged in long strings of clusters individual basidia measure <num> – <num> by <num> – <num> µm
the threads of the capillitia arise from the inner surface of the peridium and are thick @-@ walled long interwoven and branched measuring <num> – <num>
<num> µm thick
the exoperidium the outer layer of tissue comprising the rays is made of four distinct layers of tissue the mycelial layer contains branched hyphae that are <num> – <num> μm in diameter the hyphae of the fibrous layer are <num> – <num> μm diameter and branched the collenchyma @-@ type layer has branched hyphae of <num> – <num> μm diameter the soft layer contains hyphae that are <num> – <num> μm in diameter
hygrometricus as being of either unknown edibility or too tough to be edible
however they are regularly consumed in asia including nepal and south bengal where local people consume them as delicious food
they are collected from the wild and sold in the markets of india
a study of a closely related southeast asian astraeus species concluded that the fungus contained an abundance of volatile eight @-@ carbon compounds including <num> @-@ octanol <num> @-@ octen @-@ <num> @-@ ol and <num> @-@ octen @-@ <num> @-@ one that imparted a mushroom @-@ like earthy and pungent odor that was evident as an oily and moss @-@ like smell upon opening the caps
the study 's authors further noted that the fruit bodies after cooking have a roasted maillard herbal and oily flavor
volatile compounds detected after cooking the mushroom samples included furfural benzaldehyde cyclohexenone and furanyl compounds
the regional differences in opinions on edibility are from sources published before it was known that north american and asian versions of a
hygrometricus were not always the same in some cases asian specimens have been identified as new species such as a
asiaticus and a
odoratus
hygrometricus bears a superficial resemblance to member of the true earthstars geastrum it may be readily differentiated from most by the hygroscopic nature of its rays
hygroscopic earthstars include g
arenarium g
corollinum g
floriforme g
recolligens and g
kotlabae
unlike geastrum the young fruit bodies of a
hygrometricus do not have a columella sterile tissue in the gleba at the base of the spore sac
geastrum tends to have its spore sac opening surrounded by a peristome or a disc in contrast with the single lacerate slit of a
hygrometricus
there are also several microscopic differences in a
hygrometricus the basidia are not arranged in parallel columns the spores are larger and the threads of the capillitia are branched and continuous with the hyphae of the peridium
despite these differences older specimens can be difficult to distinguish from geastrum in the field
one species of geastrum g
mammosum does have thick and brittle rays that are moderately hygroscopic and could be confused with a
hygrometricus however its spores are smaller than a
hygrometricus typically about <num> µm in diameter
astraeus pteridis is larger <num> to <num> cm <num>
<num> to <num>
<num> in or more when expanded and often has a more pronounced areolate pattern on the inner surface of the rays
it is found in north america and the canary islands
a
asiaticus and a
odoratus are two similar species known from throughout asia and southeast asia respectively
a
odoratus is distinguished from a
hygrometricus by a smooth outer mycelial layer with few adhering soil particles <num> – <num> broad rays and a fresh odor similar to moist soil
the spore ornamentation of a
odoratus is also distinct from a
hygrometricus with longer and narrower spines that often joined together
a
asiaticus has an outer peridial surface covered with small granules and a gleba that is purplish @-@ chestnut in color compared to the smooth peridial surface and brownish gleba of a
hygrometricus
the upper limit of the spore size of a
asiaticus is larger than that of its more common relative ranging from <num>
<num> – <num>
<num> μm
a
koreanus sometimes named as the variety a
hygrometricus var
koreanus see taxonomy differs from the more common form in its smaller size paler fruit body and greater number of rays microscopically it has smaller spores between <num>
<num> and <num> μm in diameter and the spines on the spores differ in length and morphology
it is known from korea and japan
the mutualistic association between tree roots and the mycelium of the fungus helps the trees extract nutrients particularly phosphorus from the earth in exchange the fungus receives carbohydrates from photosynthesis
in north america associations with oak and pine are usual while in india it has been noted to grow commonly with chir pine pinus roxburghii and sal shorea robusta
the false earthstar is found on the ground in open fields often scattered or in groups especially in nutrient @-@ poor sandy or loamy soils
it has also been reported to grow on rocks preferring acid substrates like slate and granite while avoiding substrates rich in lime
in nepal fruit bodies have been collected at elevations of <num> @,@ <num> m <num> @,@ <num> ft
fruit bodies typically appear in autumn although the dry fruit bodies are persistent and may last up to several years
gelatinipulvinella astraeicola is a leotiaceous fungus with minute gelatinous pulvinate cushion @-@ shaped apothecia known to grow only on the inner surface of the rays of dead astraeus species including a
hygrometricus
the species has a cosmopolitan distribution except for arctic alpine and cold temperate regions it is common in temperate and tropical regions of the world
it has been collected in africa asia australia europe north america and south america
extracts from a
hygrometricus containing the polysaccharide named ae2 were found to inhibit the growth of several tumor cell lines in laboratory tests and stimulated the growth of splenocytes thymocytes and bone marrow cells from mice
the extract also stimulated mouse cells associated with the immune system specifically it enhanced the activity of mouse natural killer cells stimulated macrophages to produce nitric oxide and enhanced production of cytokines

it is written in middle scots
as with the other tales in the collection appended to it is a moralitas which elaborates on the moral that the fable is supposed to contain
however the appropriateness of the moralitas for the tale itself has been questioned
the tale combines two motifs
firstly a husbandman tilling the fields with his new oxen makes a rash oath aloud to give them to the wolf when the wolf overhears this he attempts to make sure that the man fulfills his promise
the fox mediates a solution by speaking to them individually eventually he fools the wolf into following him to claim his supposed reward for dropping the case and tricks him into a draw @-@ well
the moralitas connects the wolf to the wicked man the fox to the devil and the husbandman to the godly man
a probable source for the tale is petrus alfonsi 's disciplina clericalis containing the same motifs and william caxton 's aesop 's fables — though the tale is a beast fable not aesopic
however the discussion of legality and the questioning of language that take place alongside these motifs are entirely henryson 's invention
whereas the moral of alfonsi 's tale explains that the wolf lost both the oxen and the cheese because he relinquished what was present for what was to come latin pro futuro quod presens erat dimisit henryson 's moralitas more fully involves the husbandman
another source may be aesop 's fables as published by william caxton — scholar john macqueen considers this more likely than disciplina clericalis — although the tale itself is not aesopic but rather of the beast fable also beast @-@ epic genre
the plots of such works are more complicated than their aesopic counterpart tend more towards ribaldry and feature the fox making a victim of the wolf
in his anger he makes the rash oath that the wolf mot have you all at anis may at once
however the wolf is lying nearby with the fox and overhearing it promises to make him stay true to his word
eventually the oxen calm down but on the way back home the wolf jumps into their path
the wolf asks where the husbandman is driving them since they are not his to which he confirms that they are and asks why he is being stopped since he never offended the wolf before
the wolf reminds the husbandman of his earlier declaration to which he replies that a man may say things that do not mean anything
they argue and the husbandman reproaches the wolf for not having a witness in response he produces the fox
the creature takes it upon himself to mediate the dispute and takes each aside in turn
to the husbandman he says that he would lend his expertise to help him were it not for the grit coist and expence of doing so the husbandman offers him half a dozen of the fattest hens he has to which the fox acedes and goes off
to the wolf he says that the husbandman has offered an unparalleled block of cheese in exchange for him dropping the case
the wolf after some complaint agrees to this and the two proceed through the woods after the prize — all the while the fox considers how to trick the wolf
eventually as the wolf complains of the fruitlessness of their quest they arrive at a draw @-@ well with buckets on each end of a rope
seeing the reflection of the moon in the water at the bottom of the well the wolf believes there to be cheese down there and lowers the fox down to pick it up
when he complains that it is too heavy for him to lift alone the wolf jumps into the other bucket and descends to help
however this pulls up the other bucket into which the fox has jumped and so the two swap places the wolf at the bottom of the well and the fox safely escaped
the narrator professes that he does not know who helped the wolf out of the well but that the tale is at an end
the fox is likened to the devil
the farmer is likened to the godly man with whom the fiend finds fault
the woods where the wolf was cheated are corrupting goods that man longs to get
the cheese represents covetousness the well that contains it is fraud and fantasy which draws men downwards into hell
lianne farber highlights a number of these discrepancies and says that the allegory does not hold true in any traditional sense
amongst the inconsistencies is that the fox not the wolf is the figure that argues with and finds fault in the husbandman the woods of the world are not traversed by the husbandman in spite of the moralitas suggesting it is applicable to all men farber argues that even assuming the moral to be true is problematic since it apparently suggests that the godly man must bribe the figure of the judge and that this does not affect his godly status
furthermore the absence of the legal discussion and the binding quality of words from the moralitas suggests to farber that the intricate legal framework … has no impact whatsoever in resolving the issues with which it is supposed to deal
in contrast philippa m
bright considers that the moralitas of this tale as well as several others create an additional sense which co @-@ exists with the literal narrative and extends and complements it thematically treating literal details symbolically and establishing the sense through direct comparisons
according to dorothy yamamoto the significant themes in the tale are solidity and vacancy substance and illusion
the cheese that apparently resides in the well is only an illusion not a solid object and similarly the fox creates a surface reconciliation between the wolf and the husbandman but which betrays his real intentions
through their frequent misuse words that should convey real value are emptied of meaning
as an example yamamoto highlights the fox 's taill on which the wolf and husbandman make their pledge — which body part she says is used by the fox in other tales to blind his foes and is thereby a highly inappropriate object to use
the testament of cresseid seven fables

ross first played in an organized league in <year> joining montreal westmount of the canadian amateur hockey league cahl the top amateur league in canada
he scored ten goals in eight games during the season
his opponents regarded him as one of the best rushing defencemen

later that year wishing to pursue a career in banking he moved to brandon manitoba where he joined the brandon elks of the manitoba hockey league the senior league in the province
in <year> his first season he scored six goals in seven games while he recorded six goals in ten games in <year>
around this time the kenora thistles the manitoba league champions wanted to strengthen their team for the stanley cup challenge against the montreal wanderers in montreal during january <year>
they paid ross <num> @,@ <num> to play both matches a common practice at the time and the thistles won the cup
while failing to score ross started many plays and proved an important part of the team
although he played for the opposing team he received a good reception from the montreal crowd
ross did not play for the thistles when the two teams played for the cup again in march which the wanderers won to take back the cup
the following year ross moved back to montreal
he joined the wanderers the team he had helped to defeat who played in the eastern canada amateur hockey association ecaha the successor league to the cahl as the premier league in the country
he scored eight goals in ten games over the two @-@ month season that lasted from january to march
he helped the team to finish first in the ecaha and retain the cup in <year> with challenges from ottawa winnipeg and toronto
the wanderers were cup champions throughout these challenges so ross became the second player to win the cup with different teams in consecutive years after jack marshall in <year> and <year>
in january <year> he participated in the first all @-@ star game in sports history a benefit for the family of former wanderer defender hod stuart who died the previous summer
aside from his time with the wanderers ross repeated his practice of playing for other teams who paid for his services in important matches
for the <year> season ross demanded a salary of <num> @,@ <num>
although he settled for <num> @,@ <num> the average salary of hockey players at the time was <num>
ross received a cash bonus of <num> to play in a stanley cup challenge against a team from edmonton in december <year> in which the wanderers won the two @-@ game total @-@ goal series <num> – <num>
he finished the season with two goals in nine games
one of the teams the all @-@ montreal hockey club hired ross as a playing @-@ manager but the league only lasted to mid @-@ january <year> before disbanding
ross who scored four goals in four games in the cha then signed with the haileybury comets of the national hockey association nha a league formed in december <year> which proved to be the stronger replacement to the ecaha as the highest level of hockey in canada
he received <num> @,@ <num> to play in the <year> season which lasted from january to march playing twelve games for the team and finishing with six goals
before the following season the nha imposed a salary cap of <num> @,@ <num> per team
the players including ross were unhappy as this would result in a pay decrease and began looking to form their own league without a cap
ross wrote to the montreal herald stating all the players want is a fair deal
the players are not trying to bulldoze the nha but we want to know where we get off at
the plans were abandoned when they realized all the suitable arenas would be unavailable as they were owned or leased by the nha
ross scored four goals in eleven games with the wanderers who finished fourth in the five team league
during a match against the quebec bulldogs on february <num> <year> ross knocked out eddie oatman in a fight provoking a massive brawl between the two teams which the police had to break up
the fight helped to increase the reputation ross had as a tough player unwilling to back down from any opponent
the following season ross had eleven goals in nineteen games as the wanderers improved to second in the league
prior to the <year> – <num> nha season ross refused to sign a contract for the wanderers requesting a salary increase
as one of the top players on the team the wanderers agreed to his demands of <num> @,@ <num> for the forthcoming season in which he finished with four goals and nine points in eighteen games
the next season ross again concerned with his salary began negotiating with other players in the nha to leave their teams and form a new league that would offer higher wages
these actions resulted in his suspension in november <year> by emmett quinn president of the nha
ross responded by declaring himself a free agent and claiming his contract with the wanderers was no longer valid
consequently although having no technical power to do so quinn suspended ross from all organized hockey
the proposed new league failed to materialize and ross applied for reinstatement to the nha which was granted at a meeting of the team owners on december <num> <year>
the owners realized if they suspended ross they would also have to suspend all those he signed hurting the league
however ross 's actions led to his release by the wanderers
at first he trained with the montreal canadiens then joined the ottawa senators
at the conclusion of the <year> – <num> season the senators and wanderers finished with identical records of fourteen wins and six losses
a two @-@ game total goal series was played to determine the nha league champion who would contest the stanley cup with the pacific coast hockey association winner the vancouver millionaires
ross who finished with three goals in sixteen games in the season scored one goal in the first match against the wanderers a senators <num> – <num> victory and though ottawa lost the second game <num> – <num> they won the series <num> – <num>
to help the senators stop the wanderers who were known for their speed ross created a new system of defence
termed kitty bar the door it required three defenders to align themselves across the ice <num> feet in front of the goaltender to stop offensive rushes
this style of defence would later be used in a modified version known as the neutral zone trap later used widely to stop opposition offensive chances
the following year ross who had eight goals and eight assists in twenty @-@ one games was the second highest paid player on the team his salary of <num> @,@ <num> was <num> less than frank nighbor made
even so ross left the team in <year> returning to montreal in order to look after his sporting @-@ goods store and rejoining the wanderers
he scored six goals and had two assists in sixteen games for the team
the wanderers along with the montreal canadiens toronto arenas quebec bulldogs and ottawa senators dissolved the nha and founded the national hockey league nhl in november <year>
ross became coach of the wanderers but a fire on january <num> <year> destroyed their home the montreal arena and forced them to fold after four games
however the nhl insisted the team continue to play and recorded two additional scheduled matches as defaulted losses for the wanderers even though the matches were not played
with the wanderers disbanded ross retired as a player
his nhl career yielded one goal in three games played
following his playing career ross became a nhl referee
he was hired to coach the hamilton tigers for the <year> – <num> season and adopted new methods in training camp that emphasized physical fitness including work off the ice
however the tigers finished with a record of six wins and eighteen losses last in the nhl for the third successive year and ross did not return the next season
his next coaching appointment arose from meeting boston grocery store magnate charles adams during the <year> stanley cup finals
before the <year> season the nhl awarded adams an expansion team
adams first move was to hire ross as vice president general manager coach and scout
adams instructed ross to come up with a nickname portraying an untamed animal displaying speed agility and cunning
with this in mind ross named the team the boston bruins after the old english word for a bear
the team 's nickname went perfectly with the original colours of brown and yellow which were the same colours of adams grocery chain first national stores
ross utilized his many hockey connections throughout canada and the united states to sign players
even so the team started poorly
early in the first season the university of toronto hockey team was in boston for matches against local universities
the team 's manager conn smythe who later owned and managed the toronto maple leafs said that his team could easily defeat the bruins — ross 's team had won only two of their first fifteen nhl games
this began a feud between smythe and ross which lasted for over <num> years until ross death while mostly confined to newspaper reports they refused to speak to each other at nhl board of governor meetings
the bruins finished their first season with six wins in thirty games one of the worst records in the history of the league
several records were set over the course of the season the three home wins are tied for the second fewest ever and an eleven @-@ game losing streak from december <num> <year> until february <num> <year> set a record for longest losing streak surpassed in <year> and now second longest in history
with <num> wins in <num> games the following season the team greatly improved and finished one point out of a playoff spot
in <year> the western hockey league the other top professional hockey league was in decline
the patrick brothers who controlled the league offered to sell the remaining five teams for <num> @,@ <num>
ross realized the potential talent available and convinced adams to pay the money
as a result the bruins acquired the rights to several future hall of fame players the most notable being defender eddie shore
ross signed goaltender cecil tiny thompson in <year> who was with a team in minnesota despite never watching him play ralph cooney weiland was also brought over from minnesota
ross acquired cy denneny from ottawa and made him a player @-@ assistant @-@ coach while he assumed the role of coach and team manager
on november <num> <year> the bruins moved to a new arena when the boston garden opened
the team played the canadiens who won the match <num> – <num> in front of <num> @,@ <num> fans
the players signed by ross helped the bruins to improve quickly and they won the stanley cup in <year>
denneny retired after the cup win ross guiding the team to several league records in the <year> – <num> season
the team won <num> of <num> games for an
<num> winning percentage the highest in league history the five losses tied a record for fewest ever and the four road losses tied a record for second fewest
the bruins also only finished one game in a tie a record for fewest ties in a season since the nhl began recording the record in <year>
one of the longest winning streaks was also set during the season
from december <num> <year> until january <num> <year> the team won fourteen games in a row a record that lasted until <year> and now tied for third longest as of october <year>
a home winning streak began the same day and lasted for twenty games until march <num> <year> which was tied for the longest of its kind in <year>
in <year> – <num> the bruins again lost only one home game which equalled their previous record
on march <num> <year> ross substituted a sixth skater for goaltender tiny thompson in the final minute of play in a playoff game against the montreal canadiens
although the bruins lost the game <num> – <num> ross became the first coach to replace his goaltender with an extra attacker a tactic which became widespread practice in hockey
stepping aside as coach in <year> to focus on managing the team ross hired frank patrick as coach with a salary of <num> @,@ <num> which was high for such a role
however rumours spread during the season that patrick was drinking heavily and not being as strict with the players as ross wanted
after the bruins lost their playoff series with the toronto maple leafs in the <year> playoffs the result of an <num> – <num> score in the second game a newspaper claimed that patrick had been drinking the day of the game and had trouble controlling the team
several days later ross relieved patrick of his duties and once again assumed the role of coach
he had recently signed three players milt schmidt bobby bauer and woody dumart who all grew up together in kitchener ontario and had them play on the same line soon nicknamed the kraut line in reference to the german heritage of all three
along with them ross had acquired a new goaltender in <year> frank brimsek after brimsek earned six shutouts in his first eight games the bruins traded away tiny thompson to allow brimsek to play
with these players the bruins finished first in the league in <year> – <num> ross was named as the second best coach in the league selected for the end of season all @-@ star second team
the next season the bruins won <num> of <num> games and won the stanley cup in the playoffs ross was named to the first all @-@ star team as the best coach in the league for the season and the team only tied two games which is tied for the second fewest in a season
he hired the recently retired cooney weiland to coach the bruins for the <year> – <num> nhl season
the bruins would win the cup again in <year> and tied their record of only four away losses all season
ross once again took over as coach of the team before the <year> – <num> season began as weiland became coach of the hershey bears of the american hockey league and led the team to <num> wins in <num> games which was enough to earn third place in the league
by this time the second world war had caused several bruins players including the entire kraut line and goaltender brimsek to enlist in their respective armed forces
the bruins finished second in the nhl during the <year> – <num> season with <num> wins in <num> games and ross was again named in the second nhl all @-@ star team as second best coach in the league
the bruins missed the playoffs in <year> – <num> the first time in ten years they failed to qualify but returned to the playoffs the next season something they did for five straight years
in <year> ross had signed georges boucher as coach but boucher did not work well with ross and team president weston adams
looking to hire a new coach in the summer of <year> ross phoned lynn patrick the son of lester who had just resigned from the new york rangers after coaching the team to the stanley cup final
lynn had moved his family back to victoria british columbia where he grew up as a child with the intention of coaching the victoria cougars a team in the minor professional pacific coast hockey league
though reluctant to move back to the eastern united states lynn was hired by ross after he was offered a salary of <num> @,@ <num>
he would coach the team for the next four seasons and become the second general manager of the bruins when ross retired at the end of october <year>
prior to the start of the <year> – <num> season the nhl adopted a new style of goal net created by ross
with the back molded into a b @-@ shape it was better designed to catch pucks and the net was used until <year> when a modified version was adopted
he also improved the design of the puck
ross design had bevel edges which prevented it bouncing too much and used synthetic rubber rather than the natural rubber previously in vogue
along with new york rangers coach frank boucher ross helped to create the red line which was introduced to help speed up the game by removing the ability for defenders to pass the puck from the defensive to offensive zone until <year> it was against the rules of hockey to make a two line pass
more scoring chances resulted as teams could not simply send the puck down the ice with impunity
in order to help tell the red line and blue lines apart on television ross suggested that the red line be striped
regarded throughout his playing career as one of the best defenders in hockey ross was named to the hockey hall of fame in <year> selected for his playing career rather than his work as an executive
a ceremony for his induction was held prior to a bruins game on december <num> <year> where he was given his hall of fame scroll and a silver tray with the emblems of the six nhl teams on it
in <year> he was inducted into the canadian sports hall of fame
along with his two sons he donated the art ross trophy to the nhl in <year> to be awarded to the leading scorer in the league 's regular season
in <year> he was posthumously awarded the lester patrick trophy for service to hockey in the united states
a descriptive biography entitled art ross the hockey legend who built the bruins by eric zweig was published by dundurn press in sept <year>
before he became a hockey executive he had a career as a bank clerk and ran a sporting @-@ goods store in montreal
ross had moved to brandon manitoba in <year> at the advice of his parents so he could get a job with a bank with a salary of <num> per year
he gave that career up when he began playing hockey professionally
he was married to muriel a native of montreal and had two sons art and john
during the second world war both sons served in the royal canadian air force

the episodes were filmed on box beach located at shoal bay new south wales as part of a two @-@ day location shoot
nicole nearly drowns in scenes which aired for the serial 's cliff @-@ hanger in <year>
james and lewis took scuba diving lessons in preparation for the storyline
filming the storyline was compromised by logistical challenges
the crew had to move camera equipment between boats and the crew walked around the perimeters of the beach in order to avoid leaving footprints
this was to keep the authenticity of a deserted location
the storyline was also given a big budget featured helicopters and a number of promotional adverts were aired on seven
the storyline began on @-@ screen when nicole started dating elliot gillen paul pantano
he had a vendetta against roman and kidnapped nicole and geoff and left them stranded out at sea
they washed up on a deserted island and were forced to survive without food and clothing
describing the effect it had on nicole and geoff james stated they have no food shelter or clothing

they find moments to make each other laugh though and realise how much they mean to one another
geoff had strong religious views and did not believe in premarital sex
however the environment they were in caused him to let his guard down and they slept together
lewis told tv week that all the pair could think of whilst trapped was being rescued and their feelings for one an other
he added that the fact they were both pretty much naked didn 't help
he concluded the fact they were both kids trying to keep warm that then stuff happens
geoff was left guilt @-@ ridden because he gave into temptation
he did not regret it but acknowledged that he wanted to save his virginity until marriage
therefore geoff saw no other option but to propose to nicole
lewis stated he 's not <num> sure about that either but he feels that if they 're going to have sex a wedding is the only solution
describing nicole 's reaction he said that she was dumbfounded by his offer as she had believed he was acting strange because he wanted to dump her
nicole refused when she realised his reasons for proposing
according to james the moment managed to ruin their passion she also commented that nicole has liked geoff for ages and was so happy to have got together with him but now he 's spoiled it
james also admitted she was trilled to learn nicole would turn down his proposal
james later opined that nicole was the one for geoff but did not believe that geoff was the one for nicole
nicole and geoff 's relationship became strained
nicole decided to plan a return trip to the island believing it would solve their problems and bring them closer together
james said that geoff loved the surprise but found nicole very sexy and tempting
she added that everything about nicole forced geoff to question his religious beliefs and he felt he needed to back away
their trip soon turned disastrous when a man named derrick quaid john atkinson stole their food and intimidated the couple
he admitted he were a murderer and tried to attack geoff with a knife
james said he put himself in harms way to save nicole
in <year> james told inside soap that nicole and geoff had a strong friendship underneath their romance
she also described their compatibility stating they 're complete opposites which works well for them
it 's a bit of a fiery relationship and they 've been through a lot together
whilst lewis added they 're also very similar in some of their strongest traits
geoff and nicole are both stubborn and opinionated and in some ways they 're naive
in a weird way they show a side to each other nobody else gets to see
james opined nicole 's wild behaviour was often to much for geoff to cope with
in public lewis initially had negative feedback from older viewers because they felt geoff was better suited to melody
he revealed they felt like she was a bad influence for geoff because she often played games
however towards the end of their relationship he felt perception had changed due to viewers having a better understanding of nicole 's persona
it featured freya duric sophie hensser kissing nicole which sparked complaints
however for nicole it wasn 't about sexuality rather finding herself the center of attention
james described their dynamic stating freya 's exactly what nicole was like when she first arrived in the bay that is why they click
nicole relates to the wild side of freya but has no idea how far freya is going to take it
through her relationship with geoff she had mellowed however her vanity was still present
james said nicole was angry because she was on freya 's not hot list
freya kissed her to prove she thinks she is hot james opined that nicole did not enjoy the kiss but was just happy to be center of attention and happy that people were talking about her again
the incident eventually brought her to the realisation that she had become boring
nicole denied it was to do with her involvement with geoff however james said geoff was the reason she became bored
later that year the serial included a storyline which was branded bizarre after it mirrored a real life scandal that had occurred weeks earlier
lewis who plays love interest geoff had been caught up in a sex tape scandal which leaked onto the internet the serial decided to include nicole making a sex tape with trey palmer luke bracey and having it leaked
trey filmed without nicole 's consent when she found out the truth she ended their relationship
trey thought she and geoff were getting back together so aired the tape at a local film festival to gain revenge
james described nicole 's state of mind adding she 's quite vulnerable at the moment with her dad roman in prison
she 's relying on trey so this is the last thing she needs
nicole 's best friend during her initial storylines was aden jefferies todd lasance
after brendan austin kain o 'keeffe caused roman to go blind he took his anger out on nicole and aden
subsequently they became each other 's support network and lasance said it was not long afterward that they slipped between the sheets
one of the conditions of aden 's tenancy was to never sleep with nicole this made the pair feel guilty that they had deceived roman
lasance felt the storyline was controversial as he had a strong fan base for his relationship with belle taylor jessica tovey which meant he knew it would cause a stir and divide the audience
in january <year> nicole and aden get up close and personal and they decided to spend aden 's remaining time in the bay together
they shared a kiss and james told tv week that there are a lot of complications for them
she said that no one knew what was going to happen with liam murphy axle whitehead and that nicole felt guilty for betraying belle because she was her friend
james explained that nicole 's pairing with aden was a bit more serious and in @-@ depth than her usual relationships
james opined that aden was the nicer guy for nicole but liam may have had the edge she 's after
nicole and aden then embarked on a relationship
james thought that nicole and aden 's relationship was great and said they started out having a kind of brother @-@ sister relationship and that developed into something more
nicole declared her love for aden however he did not reciprocate
lasance described the moment whilst interviewed by tv week stating they 've always had an awesome connection and nicole gets into a bit of a comfortable state and blurts out that she loves aden
aden appreciated her love for him however cannot say it back until he felt the same way
it is this that made their relationship awkward nicole tried to withdraw her declaration and hide her hurt feelings
at the time nicole had endured repetitive personal trauma including failed relationships roman being sent to prison and her best friend belle was dying of cancer
james explained it 's all too much for her and she can 't handle it so she reverts to her wild ways
geoff notices nicole 's erratic behaviour and attempts to help her
she tried to lure him into bed after he comforted her however he turned her down
james said she no longer had romantic feelings for geoff but was actually in a vulnerable state
she then started relying on alcohol more and partied with fellow wild child indigo walker samara weaving at a rowdy venue
james explained that nicole saw alcohol as an answer to her problems
the fact that she 's trying to deal with too many things saw nicole transform into a messed up and depressed person
nicole became more irresponsible with the more she drank and was in the company of many men
geoff arrived and saved her from danger lewis said there was a part of geoff that still loved nicole
however they did not start anything again james said she understood why because of their complicated backstory
however geoff continued to support nicole as he realised that a lot of people she was closest to have deserted her
nicole 's unpredictable behaviour continued thereafter
all that geoff could offer was to be there for her because ultimately nicole is the only one that can save her from herself
james told sunrise that viewers could expect a realistic portrayal of teen pregnancy and she explained that it was important to respect the issue
she added we took it very seriously with the writers and you do a lot of research and things like that
you can only do your best i guess nicole later told marilyn chambers emily symons about the baby and she offered to adopt it
james later revealed that when she joined home and away she told the writers that they can do anything with her character except make her pregnant
of the moment she was told that nicole was going to have a baby james said i went in to see our producer later and he said okay i 'm going to apologise in advance we 're making nicole pregnant she initially did not want to portray a typical soap teenage pregnancy as she thought nicole should be different
however the situation was explained to her and she became excited at the challenging storyline ahead
nicole later decided to let marilyn and sid walker robert mammone adopt the baby upon its birth
marilyn was desperate to mother a child and her obsession with that and her controlling behaviour became too much for nicole
of the situation symons said marilyn is in nicole 's face every minute
she 's doing it out of love but she doesn 't realise she 's becoming obsessed with the baby
nicole was still questioning whether she is making the right decision about her unborn baby 's future and she argued with marilyn
nicole began dating a student from university angus mccathie tim pocock they got along well on their first dates
marilyn was left worried about their agreement and she felt distanced
symons explained marilyn is scared of being replaced
she 's scared of losing the baby which could happen because there isn 't a legal agreement
roo stewart georgie parker helped nicole by convincing marilyn to re @-@ evaluate the situation
symons added that there is still a long way to go with the arrangement but thereafter she was supportive and offered constructive help to nicole
during the final few weeks of her pregnancy nicole began to receive increasing support from angelo rosetta luke jacobz
james said it was clear to see that the lines of friendship could be blurring into something more for the pair
whilst jacobz opined they 've been spending time together and have realised how comfortable they are together
angelo was forced to help nicole give birth to a baby boy george and she handed him over to marilyn immediately as agreed
she then tried to stay away however it became obvious he needed her when he struggled without her
marilyn then became obsessed with nicole having the power to take her new son back
it was then revealed that nicole would struggle to switch off her mothering instinct after giving george away
nicole came to visit the baby and marilyn caught her breastfeeding george while she was alone with him
symons called the scenes volatile
nicole was unaware that marilyn has reservations about her spending time with the baby
of the breastfeeding scene symons stated marilyn is shocked and offended and this cuts to the very core of her worries that she doesn 't have the same natural mothering instincts as george 's birth mother
without a doubt marilyn thinks nicole is overstepping the mark
she feels that a boundary has been overstepped and it could put a big strain on their relationship
after the incident nicole is asked by marylin to stay away from the baby

he was positive towards jim and pam 's reconciliation but felt something hollow about their reunion
he also noted that the jim @-@ pam storyline caused the dwight @-@ angela relationship to go darker
alan sepinwall of hitfix gave the episode a slightly more mixed review writing that the non @-@ andy parts of livin the dream were fairly interesting
he appreciated the drama coming from angela 's desperation despite disagreeing with the logic in the situation
sepinwall praised the jim @-@ dwight dynamic in the episode considering it an enjoyable payoff and also praised jim and pam 's reconciliation particularly them annoying their co @-@ workers with their flirting

<num> mi east of the town of ocosingo
the site is medium to large with groups of temple @-@ pyramids set on terraces rising some <num> metres <num> ft above a plaza a large court for playing the mesoamerican ballgame and over <num> carved monuments most dating from the <num> century through the <num> centuries ad during the classic period
toniná is distinguished by its well preserved stucco sculptures and particularly by its in @-@ the @-@ round carved monuments produced to an extent not seen in mesoamerica since the end of the much earlier olmec civilization
toniná was an aggressive state in the late classic using warfare to develop a powerful kingdom
for much of its history toniná was engaged in sporadic warfare with palenque its greatest rival and one of the most important polities in the west of the maya region although toniná eventually became the dominant city in the west
the city is notable for having the last known long count date on any maya monument marking the end of the classic maya period in ad <num>
however this is a modern name and the original name was either po or popo appearing in classic maya texts in the title used for the kings of toniná k 'uhul po ajaw divine lord of po
a maya rebellion in colonial times in <year> featured a group called the po winikob people of po
early versions of the toniná emblem glyph bore a doubled po glyph and the term popo is also found in colonial records
since double sounds were often abbreviated in hieroglyphic texts popo may represent the original name of the city
toniná is separated from palenque by mountainous terrain and the site core is located along an easily defended ascending limestone ridge immediately to the west of a seasonal tributary of the río jataté one of the two rivers forming the ocosingo valley
due to this early texts are scarce and only offer a glimpse of the early history of the site
an <num> @-@ century text refers to a king ruling in ad <num> although it only mentions his title not his name
ruler <num> is depicted on a couple of early classic monuments the better preserved of which is an altar that dates to <num>
a ruler known as jaguar bird peccary is represented on a <num> @-@ century stela which describes him acceding to the throne in <num>
the first mention of toniná in a record from a foreign state is from the site of chinikiha located <num> kilometres <num> mi to the northeast on the usumacinta river the text is from a throne and describes the capture of a person from toniná in <num>
in <num> k 'inich hix chapat is recorded as installing two subordinate lords but little else is known of his reign although he was probably enthroned in <num>
the last mention of k 'inich hix chapat is in a monument dated to <num> that appears to be a memorial stone
his rule is marked by warfare and the frequent depiction of bound captives on his monuments
ruler <num> established the use of in @-@ the @-@ round sculptural style that came to typify the stelae of toniná
a monument dated to <num> depicts three naked prisoners with their arms bound one of them is identified as a lord from annak an as yet unidentified site
his reign may have ended with his defeat and capture by k 'inich kan balam ii of palenque in september <num> as described in a glyphic text from temple <num> in the rival city an event that probably culminated in his sacrifice
during his reign he restored toniná 's power with a number of military victories over palenque and his reign was dominated by the struggle against the rival city for regional power
ballcourt <num> the larger of toniná 's two ballcourts was dedicated in <num> to celebrate three victories over the city 's arch @-@ rival
the ballcourt originally had six sculptures of bound captives all vassals of the enemy palenque king from the usumacinta region
the date of the king 's death is unknown
three years later in <num> while ruler <num> was still a child toniná gained an important victory over palenque
the battle resulted in the capture of kan joy chitam ii of palenque and made toniná the dominant centre in the lower usumacinta region
the victory was so complete that it resulted in a ten @-@ year gap in the dynastic history of the defeated city during which the captured ruler may have been held hostage
ruler <num> continued in power to celebrate the period endings of <num> and <num>
a captive depicted on one of his monuments is identified as being from the distant city of calakmul one of the two maya superpowers
around <num> toniná fought a war against piedras negras a city on the north bank of the usumacinta river now in guatemala
a series of events during his reign were marked on monuments between <num> and <num> and in <num> he rededicated the tomb of his predecessor k 'inich b 'aaknal chaak
the mother of k 'inich ich 'aak chapat is named as lady winik timan k 'awiil and his father may well have been k 'inich b 'aaknal chaak himself
the reign of k 'inich ich 'aak chapat is notable for the absence of the usual sculptures depicting bound war captives although the reason for this is unknown
a damaged text accompanying the image of a bound captive indicates renewed warfare with palenque during his reign however the name of the prisoner is lost and it is unclear if it is the actual king of palenque or merely one of his vassals
he was succeeded by ruler <num> about whom even less is known
around <num> toniná defeated palenque in battle
in <num> a text recorded the death of lord wak chan k 'ak a prince who appears to have been the heir to the throne and who died before he could take power
ruler <num> was the last of the successful warrior kings of toniná
he celebrated a series of events between <num> and <num> including the defeat of pomoy in <num> and the capture of the ruler ucha 'an aj chih who appears to have been the vassal of b 'olon k 'awiil of calakmul
in <num> he rededicated the tomb of ruler <num>
ruler <num> oversaw an extensive remodelling of the upper levels of the acropolis
ruler <num> erected a number of sculptures of bound prisoners of war and adopted the title aj b 'olon b 'aak he of many captives
however the lesser extent of toniná 's power is evident from its victory over the site of sak tz 'i white dog an important city in the lacandon region an area which had once been dominated by toniná
by the time of ruler <num> 's successor uh chapat toniná was clearly in decline
only a single event in <num> can be dated to his reign although a stucco mural depicting captives with garrottes at their throats may belong to his period of rule
the history of toniná continued after most other classic maya cities had fallen perhaps aided by the site 's relative isolation
ruler <num> is associated with a monument dating to <num> in the terminal classic and a monument dating to <num> bears the last known long count date although the name of the king has not survived
ceramic fragments indicate that occupation at the site continued for another century or more
a number of visitors investigated the ruins of toniná in the <num> century the first being an expedition led by guillaume dupaix in <year>
john lloyd stephens and frederick catherwood visited in <year> and stephens wrote an extensive description of the site
eduard seler and caecilie seler @-@ sachs investigated the monuments at toniná publishing their reports at the turn of the <num> century
karl sapper visited the site in <year> and <year>
frans blom and oliver la farge investigated the site in <num> for tulane university publishing their reports in <year> — <year>
the french toniná project began excavations in <year> which continued through <year> then resumed in <year> to <year> under the direction of pierre becquelin and claude baudez
the national institute of anthropology and history of mexico inah the instituto nacional de antropologia e historia began their own excavations at toniná the following year
the site is accessible for tourism and has a small museum that was inaugurated on <num> july <year>
the principal architecture is located in the acropolis which occupies seven south @-@ facing terraces on the northern side of the platform rising <num> metres <num> ft over the plaza below
it has a more distinct geometry than at most maya sites with a right @-@ angle relationship between most structures
much of the public imagery of the site details the ruthless manner in which the city dealt with its enemies
a <num> by <num> metres <num> by <num> ft stucco sculpture rising from the fourth to fifth terraces depicts a skeletal death god carrying the severed head of a lord of palenque in one hand
a frieze on the fifth terrace probably displayed toniná 's most distinguished victims dozens of fragments of this frieze were discovered in the plaza below
this frieze was carved from the local sandstone but its style is that of palenque suggesting that captured artists carried out the work
after the abandonment of the city at the end of the classic period many of the sculptures fell down the steep embankment supporting the seven terraces
sculptures of the torsos of six captured vassals of the palenque king were used as ballcourt markers
one of these vassals is named as yax ahk green turtle who was the lord of annay te a site that probably lay on the south side of the usumacinta between piedras negras and yaxchilán
ballcourt <num> is the smaller of the two ballcourts and lies in the north of the plaza at the foot of the acropolis
the palace of the underworld is entered via three step @-@ vaulted arches on the eastern side of the second terrace of the acropolis
the palace of frets is located on the fourth terrace of the acropolis
the south facade of the palace is decorated with four large stepped frets
on the east side of the palace a stairway leads to a decorated throne of stone and stucco
one of the rooms of the palace contains a stucco decoration representing feathered serpents and crossed bones
<num> ft tall
the most important difference from monuments at other maya sites is that they are carved in the round like statues often with hieroglyphic text running down the spine
on the fifth terrace in @-@ the @-@ round sculptures of toniná 's rulers dominated two @-@ dimensional representations of defeated enemies
the dated monuments at toniná span the period from ad <num> to <num> covering most of the classic period
monument <num> is broken into various fragments five of which were recovered from various locations in ocosingo and toniná through the course of the <num> century and most of which were reunited in the toniná site museum
aside from being broken the stela is largely complete and only lightly eroded it is a statue of a ruler with inscriptions describing the accession of k 'inich baaknal chaak and the promotion to the priesthood of aj ch 'aaj naah
monument <num> was recovered from a school in ocosingo and moved to the site museum of toniná
it is a badly eroded life @-@ size human statue with the head missing
monument <num> is carved from yellow sandstone and has suffered only minor damage
it is a stela base with well @-@ preserved hieroglyphs on all four vertical sides and was dedicated by k 'inich ich 'aak chapat in <num>
it is currently in the museo regional in tuxtla gutiérrez
monument <num> dates to the reign of ruler <num>
it marks the period ending of <num> and shows the presentation of three war captives
monument <num> is a sculpture carved in the round representing ruler <num>
it dates to ad <num>
monument <num> is a carved step depicting k 'awiil mo a lord from palenque as an elderly prisoner bound and lying on his back with his profile positioned in such a way as to be trodden on time and again
monument <num> is an undated fragment that depicts a female captive which is rare in maya art
monument <num> has the last long count date from any maya monument it marks the k 'atun ending of ad <num>
monument <num> is the earliest securely dated monument at the site dating to ad <num>
it depicts ruler <num>
monument <num> depicts ruler <num> participating in a scattering ritual
monument <num> was dedicated in <num> by ruler <num>
it commemorates the death of an important noble apparently a relative or vassal of ruler <num> 's predecessor tuun chapat
monument <num> is a low relief sculpture marking the defeat of palenque by ruler <num> in <num> and the capture of kan joy chitam ii who is depicted as a bound captive
monument <num> is a very well preserved hieroglyphic panel carved from fine grained white limestone with almost the whole inscription intact
it describes the dedication of a ballcourt by k 'inich b 'aaknal chaak
monument <num> dates to the reign of k 'inich hix chapat and records his installing of two subordinate lords in <num>
monument <num> has a very late date in ad <num> at the very end of the classic period
it was erected during the reign of ruler <num>
the frieze of the dream lords also known as the frieze of the four suns or frieze of the four eras was uncovered by archaeologists during excavations in <year>
it is a stucco mural located at the east end of the <num> terrace
it represents a complex supernatural scene divided into four by a feather @-@ covered scaffold from which hang the severed heads of sacrificial victims
among the scaffold partitions are depicted the wayob spirit companions of the maya elite
the most well @-@ preserved section of the sculpture depicts a skeletal supernatural way named ak ok kimi turtle foot death wearing turtleshells on its feet and carrying a severed head in one hand interpreted as the way of a lord from the site of pipa
the frieze was once brightly painted in red blue and yellow
this frieze has strong stylistic parallels with mural paintings at the great early classic metropolis of teotihuacan in the distant valley of mexico
it possesses <num> exhibition rooms and a conference room
the first room explains the pyramidal form of the acropolis and how it relates to maya mythology while the main room contains sculptures of the city 's rulers
artefacts in the collection include stone sculptures ceramics and artefacts sculpted from bone shell obsidian and flint
the pieces in the museum graphically depict the two sides of the power exercised by toniná on the one hand with sculptures of the city 's rulers and on the other with its depictions of bound prisoners of war
it was formed in march <year> and covered the central portion of new south wales
headquartered at sydney central area command was primarily responsible for air defence aerial reconnaissance and protection of the sea lanes within its boundaries
it was disbanded in august <year> and control of its units taken over by other raaf formations
proposals in <year> – <num> to raise a new central area command did not come to fruition
after war broke out in september <year> the raaf began to implement a decentralised form of command commensurate with expected increases in manpower and units
its initial move in this direction was to create nos
<num> and <num> groups to control units in victoria and new south wales respectively
then between march <year> and may <year> the raaf divided australia and new guinea into four geographically based command @-@ and @-@ control zones central area southern area western area and northern area
the roles of these area commands were air defence protection of adjacent sea lanes and aerial reconnaissance
each was led by an air officer commanding aoc responsible for the administration and operations of all air bases and units within his boundary
no
<num> group which had been established on <num> november <year> was re @-@ formed as one of the first two area commands central area on <num> march <year>
headquartered in sydney central area command was given control of all air force units in new south wales except those in the southern riverina and the north of the state
units in queensland were also temporarily assigned to its control pending the formation of northern area
central area 's inaugural aoc was air commodore adrian king cole who had also led no
<num> group
his senior air staff officer was wing commander alan charlesworth
in may <year> it was reported that the area 's headquarters building would change from mont loana in point piper to the mansion kilmory nearby
cole handed over command of central area to air commodore bill anderson in december <year>
by august <year> the raaf 's expanding instructional program necessitated the establishment of overarching training organisations on a semi @-@ functional semi @-@ geographical basis
accordingly no
<num> training group was formed in sydney taking responsibility for the training units then under central area which was disbanded
control of other central area units was divided as convenient according to the official history of the war between northern and southern area commands
in october <year> the air board proposed carving a new central area command out of eastern area which by then was considered too large to be controlled by one headquarters and therefore ripe for subdivision
this central area command would have been responsible for training and operational units in southern queensland
the war cabinet deferred its decision on the proposal
the concept was raised again in august <year> and this time the new central area command was to control maintenance units as well as training and operations in southern queensland
once again nothing came of the proposal
it breeds in europe and asia as far east as western china and migrates to africa for the northern hemisphere 's winter
it is a medium @-@ sized crake with buff- or grey @-@ streaked brownish @-@ black upperparts chestnut markings on the wings and blue @-@ grey underparts with rust @-@ coloured and white bars on the flanks and undertail
the strong bill is flesh @-@ toned the iris is pale brown and the legs and feet are pale grey
juveniles are similar in plumage to adults and downy chicks are black as with all rails
there are no subspecies although individuals from the east of the breeding range tend to be slightly paler than their western counterparts
the male 's call is a loud krek krek from which the scientific name is derived
the corn crake is larger than its closest relative the african crake which shares its wintering range that species is also darker @-@ plumaged and has a plainer face
the corn crake 's breeding habitat is grassland particularly hayfields and it uses similar environments on the wintering grounds
this secretive species builds a nest of grass leaves in a hollow in the ground and lays <num> – <num> cream @-@ coloured eggs which are covered with rufous blotches
these hatch in <num> – <num> days and the black precocial chicks fledge after about five weeks
this crake is in steep decline across much of its former breeding range because modern farming practices often destroy nests before breeding is completed
the corn crake is omnivorous but mainly feeds on invertebrates the occasional small frog or mammal and plant material including grass seed and cereal grain
natural threats include introduced and feral mammals large birds various parasites and diseases
although numbers have declined steeply in western europe this bird is classed as least concern on the iucn red list because of its huge range and large apparently stable populations in russia and kazakhstan
numbers in western china are more significant than previously thought and conservation measures have facilitated an increased population in some countries which had suffered the greatest losses
despite its elusive nature the loud call has ensured the corn crake has been noted in literature and garnered a range of local and dialect names
although origins of the group are lost in antiquity the largest number of species and least specialised forms are found in the old world suggesting this family originated there
the taxonomy of the small crakes is complicated but the closest relative of the corn crake is the african crake c
egregia which has sometimes been given its own genus crecopsis but is now more usually placed in crex
both species are short @-@ billed brown birds with a preference for grassland rather than wetland habitats typical of rails
porzana crakes particularly the ash @-@ throated crake porzana albicollis are near relatives of the crex genus
corn crakes were first described by linnaeus in his systema naturae in <year> as rallus crex but was subsequently moved to the genus crex created by german naturalist and ornithologist johann matthäus bechstein in <year> and named crex pratensis
the earlier use of crex gives it priority over bechstein 's specific name pratensis and leads to the current name of crex crex
the binomial name crex crex from the ancient greek κρεξ is onomatopoeic referring to the crake 's repetitive grating call
the common name was formerly spelt as a single word corncrake but the official version is now corn crake
the english names refer to the species habit of nesting in dry hay or cereal fields rather than marshes used by most members of this family
males weigh <num> g <num>
<num> oz on average and females <num> g <num>
<num> oz
the adult male has the crown of its head and all of its upperparts brown @-@ black in colour streaked with buff or grey
the wing coverts are a distinctive chestnut colour with some white bars
the face neck and breast are blue @-@ grey apart from a pale brown streak from the base of the bill to behind the eye the belly is white and the flanks and undertail are barred with chestnut and white
the strong bill is flesh @-@ coloured the iris is pale brown and the legs and feet are pale grey
compared to the male the female has warmer @-@ toned upperparts and a narrower duller eye streak
outside the breeding season the upperparts of both sexes become darker and the underparts less grey
the juvenile is like the adult in appearance but has a yellow tone to its upperparts and the grey of the underparts is replaced with buff @-@ brown
the chicks have black down as with all rails
while there are no subspecies all populations show great individual variation in colouring and the birds gradually become paler and greyer towards the east of the range
adults undergo a complete moult after breeding which is normally finished by late august or early september before migration to south eastern africa
there is a pre @-@ breeding partial moult prior to the return from africa mainly involving the plumage of the head body and tail
young birds have a head and body moult about five weeks after hatching
the corn crake is sympatric with the african crake on the wintering grounds but can be distinguished by its larger size paler upperparts tawny upperwing and different underparts pattern
in flight it has longer less rounded wings and shallower wingbeats than its african relative and shows a white leading edge to the inner wing
in both the breeding and wintering ranges it is unlikely to be confused with any other rails since sympatric species are smaller with white markings on the upperparts different underparts patterns and shorter bills
a flying corn crake can resemble a gamebird but its chestnut wing pattern and dangling legs are diagnostic
the call can be heard from <num>
<num> km <num>
<num> mi away and serves to establish the breeding territory attract females and challenge intruding males
slight differences in vocalisations mean that individual males can be distinguished by their calls
early in the season the call is given almost continuously at night and often during the day too
it may be repeated more than <num> @,@ <num> times a night with a peak between midnight and <num> am
the call has evolved to make a singing male 's location clear as this species hides in vegetation
the frequency of calling reduces after a few weeks but may intensify again near the end of the laying period before falling away towards the end of the breeding season
to attract males mechanical imitations of their call can be produced by rubbing a piece of wood down a notched stick or by flicking a credit card against a comb or zip @-@ fastener
the male also has a growling call given with the bill shut and used during aggressive interactions
the female corn crake may give a call that is similar to that of the male it also has a distinctive barking sound similar in rhythm to the main call but without the grating quality
the female also has a high @-@ pitched cheep call and a oo @-@ oo @-@ oo sound to call the chick
the chicks make a quiet peeick @-@ peeick contact call and a chirp used to beg for food
because of the difficulty in seeing this species it is usually censused by counting males calling between <num> pm and <num> am the birds do not move much at night whereas they may wander up to <num> m <num> yd during the day which could lead to double @-@ counting if monitored then
identifying individual males suggests that just counting calling birds underestimates the true count by nearly <num> and the discrepancy is likely to be greater since only <num> of males may call at all on a given night
the corn crake is silent in africa
although it has vanished from much of its historic range this bird was once found in suitable habitats in eurasia everywhere between latitudes <num> ° n and <num> ° n
there is also a sizable population in western china but this species nests only rarely in northern spain and in turkey
old claims of breeding in south africa are incorrect and result from misidentification of eggs in a museum collection which are actually those of the african rail
the corn crake winters mainly in africa from the democratic republic of the congo and central tanzania south to eastern south africa
north of this area it is mainly seen on migration but occasionally winters in north africa and to the west and north of its core area in southeast africa
most of the south african population of about <num> @,@ <num> birds occurs in kwazulu @-@ natal and the former transvaal province and numbers elsewhere in africa are uncertain
there are several nineteenth @-@ century records when populations were much higher than now of birds being seen in western europe mainly britain and ireland between december and february
this crake migrates to africa along two main routes a western route through morocco and algeria and a more important flyway through egypt
on passage it has been recorded in most countries between its breeding and wintering ranges including much of west africa
birds from coll following the western route paused in west africa on their way further south and again on the return flight when they also rested in spain or north africa
eastern migrants have been recorded in those parts of southern asia that lie between the east of the breeding range and africa
further afield the corn crake has been recorded as a vagrant to sri lanka vietnam and australia the seychelles bermuda canada the us greenland iceland the faroes the azores madeira and the canary islands
the corn crake is mainly a lowland species but breeds up to <num> @,@ <num> m <num> @,@ <num> ft altitude in the alps <num> @,@ <num> m <num> @,@ <num> ft in china and <num> @,@ <num> m <num> @,@ <num> ft in russia
when breeding in eurasia the corn crake 's habitats would originally have included river meadows with tall grass and meadow plants including sedges and irises
it is now mainly found in cool moist grassland used for the production of hay particularly moist traditional farmland with limited cutting or fertiliser use
it also utilises other treeless grasslands in mountains or taiga on coasts or where created by fire
moister areas like wetland edges may be used but very wet habitats are avoided as are open areas and those with vegetation more than <num> cm <num> in tall or too dense to walk through
the odd bush or hedge may be used as a calling post
grassland which is not mown or grazed becomes too matted to be suitable for nesting but locally crops such as cereals peas rape clover or potatoes may be used
after breeding adults move to taller vegetation such as common reed iris or nettles to moult returning to the hay and silage meadows for the second brood
in china flax is also used for nest sites
although males often sing in intensively managed grass or cereal crops successful breeding is uncommon and nests in the field margins or nearby fallow ground are more likely to succeed
when wintering in africa the corn crake occupies dry grassland and savanna habitats occurring in vegetation <num> – <num> cm <num>
<num> – <num>
<num> ft tall including seasonally burnt areas and occasionally sedges or reed beds
it is also found on fallow and abandoned fields uncut grass on airfields and the edges of crops
it occurs at up to at least <num> @,@ <num> metres <num> @,@ <num> ft altitude in south africa
each bird stays within a fairly small area
although it sometimes occurs with the african crake that species normally prefers moister and shorter grassland habitats than does the corn crake
on migration the corn crake may also occur in wheatfields and around golf courses
occasionally individuals may become very trusting for five consecutive summers an individual crake on the scottish island of tiree entered a kitchen to feed on scraps and in <year> a wintering barra bird would come for poultry feed once the chickens had finished
in africa it is more secretive than the african crake and unlike its relative it is rarely seen in the open although it occasionally feeds on tracks or road sides
the corn crake is most active early and late in the day after heavy rain and during light rain
its typical flight is weak and fluttering although less so than that of the african crake
for longer flights such as migration it has a steadier stronger action with legs drawn up
it walks with a high @-@ stepping action and can run swiftly through grass with its body held horizontal and laterally flattened
it will swim if essential
when flushed by a dog it will fly less than <num> m <num> ft frequently landing behind a bush or thicket and then crouch on landing
if disturbed in the open this crake will often run in a crouch for a short distance with its neck stretched forward then stand upright to watch the intruder
when captured it may feign death recovering at once if it sees a way out
the corn crake is solitary on the wintering grounds where each bird occupies <num>
<num> – <num>
<num> ha <num> – <num> acres at one time although the total area used may be double that since an individual may move locally due to flooding plant growth or grass cutting
flocks of up to <num> birds may form on migration sometimes associating with common quails
migration takes place at night and flocks resting during the day may aggregate to hundreds of birds at favoured sites
the ability to migrate is innate not learned from adults
chicks raised from birds kept in captivity for ten generations were able to migrate to africa and return with similar success to wild @-@ bred young
the male 's territory can vary from <num> to <num> ha <num>
<num> to <num>
<num> acres but averages <num>
<num> ha <num> acres
the female has a much smaller range averaging only <num>
<num> ha <num> acres
a male will challenge an intruder by calling with his wings drooped and his head pointing forward
usually the stranger moves off if it stays the two birds square up with heads and necks raised and the wings touching the ground
they then run around giving the growling call and lunging at each other
a real fight may ensue with the birds leaping at each other and pecking and sometimes kicking
females play no part in defending the territory
the female may be offered food by the male during courtship
he has a brief courtship display in which the neck is extended and the head held down the tail is fanned and the wings are spread with the tips touching the ground
he will then attempt to approach the female from behind and then leap on her back to copulate
the nest is typically in grassland sometimes in safer sites along a hedge or near an isolated tree or bush or in overgrown vegetation
where grass is not tall enough at the start of the season the first nest may be constructed in herby or marsh vegetation with the second brood in hay
the second nest may also be at a higher altitude that the first to take advantage of the later @-@ developing grasses further up a hill
the nest well hidden in the grass is built in a scrape or hollow in the ground
it is made of woven coarse dry grass and other plants and lined with finer grasses
although nest construction is usually described as undertaken by the female a recent aviary study found that in the captive population the male always built the nest
the nest is <num> – <num> cm <num>
<num> – <num>
<num> in in diameter and <num> – <num> cm <num>
<num> – <num>
<num> in deep
the clutch is <num> – <num> usually <num> – <num> eggs these are oval slightly glossy creamy or tinted with green blue or grey and blotched red @-@ brown
they average <num> mm × <num> mm <num>
<num> in × <num>
<num> in and weigh about <num> – <num> g <num>
<num> – <num>
<num> oz of which <num> is shell
the eggs are laid at daily intervals but second clutches may sometimes have two eggs added per day
incubation is by the female only her tendency to sit tight when disturbed or wait until the last moment to flee leads to many deaths during hay @-@ cutting and harvesting
the eggs hatch together after <num> – <num> days and the precocial chicks leave the nest within a day or two
they are fed by the female for three or four days but can find their own food thereafter
the juveniles fledge after <num> – <num> days
the second brood is started about <num> days after the first and the incubation period is slightly shorter at <num> – <num> days
the grown young may stay with the female until departure for africa
nest success in undisturbed sites is high at <num> – <num> but much lower in fertilised meadows and on arable land
the method and timing of mowing is crucial mechanized mowing can kill <num> – <num> of chicks in a given site and losses average <num> of first brood chicks and somewhat less than <num> of second brood chicks
the influence of weather on chick survival is limited although chick growth is faster in dry or warm weather the effects are relatively small
unlike many precocial species chicks are fed by their mother to a greater or lesser extent until they become independent and this may cushion them from adverse conditions
the number of live chicks hatched is more important than the weather with lower survival in large broods
the annual adult survival rate is under <num> although some individuals may live for <num> – <num> years
in the breeding areas it is a predator of sitona weevils which infest legume crops
and in the past consumed large amounts of the former grassland pests leatherjackets and wireworms
this crake will also eat small frogs and mammals and plant material including grass seed and cereal grain
its diet on the wintering grounds is generally similar but includes locally available items such as termites cockroaches and dung beetles
food is taken from the ground low @-@ growing plants and from inside grass tussocks the crake may search leaf litter with its bill and run in pursuit of active prey
hunting is normally in cover but particularly in the wintering areas it will occasionally feed on grassy tracks or dirt roads
indigestible material is regurgitated as <num> cm <num>
<num> in pellets
chicks are fed mainly on animal food and when fully grown they may fly with the parents up to <num>
<num> km <num>
<num> mi to visit supplementary feeding areas
as with other rails grit is swallowed to help break up food in the stomach
in lithuania the introduced raccoon dog has also been recorded as taking corn crakes
when chicks are exposed by rapid mowing they may be taken by large birds including the white stork harriers and other birds of prey gulls and corvids
at undisturbed sites nests and broods are rarely attacked as reflected in a high breeding success
there is a record of a corn crake on migration through gabon being killed by a black sparrowhawk
the widespread fluke prosthogonimus ovatus which lives in the oviducts of birds has been recorded in the corn crake as have the parasitic worm plagiorchis elegans the larvae of parasitic flies and hard ticks of the genera haemaphysalis and ixodes
during the reintroduction of corn crakes to england in the <year> breeding season enteritis and ill health in pre @-@ release birds was due to bacteria of a pathogenic campylobacter species
subsequently microbiology tests were done to detect infected individuals and to find the source of the bacteria in their environment
it is therefore now classed as least concern since the major populations in russia and kazakhstan are not expected to change much in the short term
there are an estimated <num>
<num> – <num>
<num> million breeding pairs in europe three @-@ quarters of which are in european russia and a further <num> @,@ <num> – <num> @,@ <num> @,@ <num> pairs in asiatic russia the total eurasian population has been estimated at between <num>
<num> and <num>
<num> million individuals
in much of the western half of its range there have been long @-@ term declines that are expected to continue although conservation measures have enabled numbers to grow in several countries including a five @-@ fold increase in finland and a doubling in the uk
in the netherlands there were <num> breeding territories in <year> but this number had increased to at least <num> by <year>
the breeding corn crake population had begun to decline in the <num> century but the process gained pace after world war ii
the main cause of the steep declines in much of europe is the loss of nests and chicks from early mowing
haymaking dates have moved forward in the past century due to faster crop growth made possible by land drainage and the use of fertilisers and the move from manual grass @-@ cutting using scythes to mechanical mowers at first horse @-@ drawn and later pulled by tractors
mechanisation also means that large areas can be cut quickly leaving the crake with no alternative sites to raise either a first brood if suitable habitat has gone or a replacement brood if the first nest is destroyed
the pattern of mowing typically in a circular pattern from the outside of a field to its centre gives little chance of escape for the chicks which are also exposed to potential animal predators
adults can often escape the mowers although some incubating females sit tight on the nest with fatal results
loss of habitat is the other major threat to the corn crake
apart from the reduced suitability of drained and fertilised silage fields compared to traditional hay meadows in western europe the conversion of grassland to arable has been aided by subsidies and further east the collapse of collective farming has led to the abandonment and lack of management of much land in this important breeding area
more localised threats include floods in spring and disturbance by roads or wind farms
this bird is good eating when they were common in england mrs beeton recommended roasting four on a skewer
more significant than direct hunting is the loss of many birds up to <num> @,@ <num> a year in egypt where migrating birds are captured in nets set for the quail with which they often migrate
although this may account for <num>
<num> – <num>
<num> of the european population the losses to this form of hunting are less than when the targeted species were more numerous and predictable
most european countries have taken steps to conserve the corn crake and produce national management policies there is also an overall european action plan
the focus of conservation effort is to monitor populations and ecology and to improve survival principally through changing the timing and method of hay harvesting
later cutting gives time for breeding to be completed and leaving uncut strips at the edges of fields and cutting from the centre outwards reduces the casualties from mowing
implementing these changes is predicted to stop the population decline if the measures are applied on a sufficiently large scale
reduction of illegal hunting and protection in countries where hunting is still allowed are also conservation aims
reintroduction of the corn crake is being attempted in england and breeding sites are scheduled for protection in many other countries
where breeding sites impinge on urban areas there are cost implications estimated in one german study at several million euros per corn crake
the corn crake does not appear to be seriously threatened on its wintering grounds and may benefit from deforestation which creates more open habitats
crake gallinule also had a period of popularity between <year> and <year>
the originally older scots cornecrake was popularised by thomas bewick who used this term in his <year> a history of british birds
other scots names include corn scrack and quailzie the latter term like king of the quail grass quail the french roi de caille and the german wachtelkönig refer to the association with the small gamebird
another name daker has been variously interpreted as onomatopoeic or derived from the old norse ager @-@ hoene meaning cock of the field variants include drake drake hen and gorse drake
the narrator depicts the scene of a mower cutting the grass before his whistling sithe unknowingly carves the rail
the farmhand draws out the scythe all bloody from its breast and does the stroke detest
it continues with a stanza that demonstrates the problematic nature of the corn crake 's nesting habits john clare the nineteenth @-@ century english poet based in northamptonshire wrote the landrail a semi @-@ comic piece which is primarily about the difficulty of seeing corn crakes – as opposed to hearing them
in the fourth verse he exclaims tis like a fancy everywhere a sort of living doubt
clare wrote about corn crakes in his prose works too and his writings help to clarify the distribution of this rail when it was far more widespread than now
the finnish poet eino leino also wrote about the bird in his poem nocturne
the proverbial use of the corn crake 's call to describe someone with a grating or unmelodious voice is illustrated in the quotation thanks to a wee woman with a voice like a corncrake who believed she was an apprentice angel
this usage dates from at least the first half of the nineteenth century and continues through to the present
aml is the most common acute leukemia affecting adults and its incidence increases with age
although aml is a relatively rare disease accounting for roughly <num>
<num> of cancer deaths in the united states its incidence is expected to increase as the population ages
the symptoms of aml are caused by replacement of normal bone marrow with leukemic cells which causes a drop in red blood cells platelets and normal white blood cells
these symptoms include fatigue shortness of breath easy bruising and bleeding and increased risk of infection
several risk factors and chromosomal abnormalities have been identified but the specific cause is not clear
as an acute leukemia aml progresses rapidly and is typically fatal within weeks or months if left untreated
aml has several subtypes treatment and prognosis vary among subtypes
aml is cured in <num> – <num> of people less than <num> years old and <num> – <num> more than <num> years old
older people who are not able to withstand intensive chemotherapy have an average survival of <num> – <num> months
aml is treated initially with chemotherapy aimed at inducing a remission people may go on to receive additional chemotherapy or a hematopoietic stem cell transplant
recent research into the genetics of aml has resulted in the availability of tests that can predict which drug or drugs may work best for a particular person as well as how long that person is likely to survive
the treatment and prognosis of aml differ from those of chronic myelogenous leukemia cml in part because the cellular differentiation is not the same aml involves higher percentages of dedifferentiated and undifferentiated cells including more blasts myeloblasts monoblasts and megakaryoblasts
a lack of normal white blood cell production makes people more susceptible to infections while the leukemic cells themselves are derived from white blood cell precursors they have no infection @-@ fighting capacity
a drop in red blood cell count anemia can cause fatigue paleness and shortness of breath
a lack of platelets can lead to easy bruising or bleeding with minor trauma
the early signs of aml are often vague and nonspecific and may be similar to those of influenza or other common illnesses
some generalized symptoms include fever fatigue weight loss or loss of appetite shortness of breath anemia easy bruising or bleeding petechiae flat pin @-@ head sized spots under the skin caused by bleeding bone and joint pain and persistent or frequent infections
enlargement of the spleen may occur in aml but it is typically mild and asymptomatic
lymph node swelling is rare in aml in contrast to acute lymphoblastic leukemia
the skin is involved about <num> of the time in the form of leukemia cutis
rarely sweet 's syndrome a paraneoplastic inflammation of the skin can occur with aml
some people with aml may experience swelling of the gums because of infiltration of leukemic cells into the gum tissue
rarely the first sign of leukemia may be the development of a solid leukemic mass or tumor outside of the bone marrow called a chloroma
occasionally a person may show no symptoms and the leukemia may be discovered incidentally during a routine blood test
the risk is highest about three to five years after chemotherapy
other chemotherapy agents specifically epipodophyllotoxins and anthracyclines have also been associated with treatment @-@ related leukemias which are often associated with specific chromosomal abnormalities in the leukemic cells
occupational chemical exposure to benzene and other aromatic organic solvents is controversial as a cause of aml
benzene and many of its derivatives are known to be carcinogenic in vitro
while some studies have suggested a link between occupational exposure to benzene and increased risk of aml others have suggested the attributable risk if any is slight
survivors of the atomic bombings of hiroshima and nagasaki had an increased rate of aml as did radiologists exposed to high levels of x @-@ rays prior to the adoption of modern radiation safety practices
people treated with ionizing radiation after treatment for prostate cancer non @-@ hodgkin lymphoma lung cancer and breast cancer have the highest chance of acquiring aml but this increased risk returns to the background risk observed in the general population after <num> years
multiple cases of aml developing in a family at a rate higher than predicted by chance alone have been reported
several congenital conditions may increase the risk of leukemia the most common is probably down syndrome which is associated with a <num> to <num> @-@ fold increase in the risk of aml
while an excess of abnormal white blood cells leukocytosis is a common finding and leukemic blasts are sometimes seen aml can also present with isolated decreases in platelets red blood cells or even with a low white blood cell count leukopenia
while a presumptive diagnosis of aml can be made by examination of the peripheral blood smear when there are circulating leukemic blasts a definitive diagnosis usually requires an adequate bone marrow aspiration and biopsy
marrow or blood is examined under light microscopy as well as flow cytometry to diagnose the presence of leukemia to differentiate aml from other types of leukemia e
g
acute lymphoblastic leukemia all and to classify the subtype of disease
a sample of marrow or blood is typically also tested for chromosomal abnormalities by routine cytogenetics or fluorescent in situ hybridization
genetic studies may also be performed to look for specific mutations in genes such as flt3 nucleophosmin and kit which may influence the outcome of the disease
cytochemical stains on blood and bone marrow smears are helpful in the distinction of aml from all and in subclassification of aml
the combination of a myeloperoxidase or sudan black stain and a nonspecific esterase stain will provide the desired information in most cases
the myeloperoxidase or sudan black reactions are most useful in establishing the identity of aml and distinguishing it from all
the nonspecific esterase stain is used to identify a monocytic component in amls and to distinguish a poorly differentiated monoblastic leukemia from all
the diagnosis and classification of aml can be challenging and should be performed by a qualified hematopathologist or hematologist
in straightforward cases the presence of certain morphologic features such as auer rods or specific flow cytometry results can distinguish aml from other leukemias however in the absence of such features diagnosis may be more difficult
the two most commonly used classification schemata for aml are the older french @-@ american @-@ british fab system and the newer world health organization who system
according to the widely used who criteria the diagnosis of aml is established by demonstrating involvement of more than <num> of the blood and or bone marrow by leukemic myeloblasts except in the three best prognosis forms of aml with recurrent genetic abnormalities t <num> <num> inv <num> and t <num> <num> in which the presence of the genetic abnormality is diagnostic irrespective of blast percent
the french – american – british fab classification is a bit more stringent requiring a blast percentage of at least <num> in bone marrow bm or peripheral blood pb for the diagnosis of aml
aml must be carefully differentiated from preleukemic conditions such as myelodysplastic or myeloproliferative syndromes which are treated differently
because acute promyelocytic leukemia apl has the highest curability and requires a unique form of treatment it is important to quickly establish or exclude the diagnosis of this subtype of leukemia
fluorescent in situ hybridization performed on blood or bone marrow is often used for this purpose as it readily identifies the chromosomal translocation t <num> <num> q22 q12 that characterizes apl
there is also a need to molecularly detect the presence of pml rara fusion protein which is an oncogenic product of that translocation
each of the who categories contains numerous descriptive subcategories of interest to the hematopathologist and oncologist however most of the clinically significant information in the who schema is communicated via categorization into one of the subtypes listed below
the who subtypes of aml are acute leukemias of ambiguous lineage also known as mixed phenotype or biphenotypic acute leukemia occur when the leukemic cells can not be classified as either myeloid or lymphoid cells or where both types of cells are present
this is done by examining the appearance of the malignant cells with light microscopy and or by using cytogenetics to characterize any underlying chromosomal abnormalities
the subtypes have varying prognoses and responses to therapy
although the who classification see above may be more useful the fab system is still widely used
eight fab subtypes were proposed in <year>
the morphologic subtypes of aml also include rare types not included in the fab system such as acute basophilic leukemia which was proposed as a ninth subtype <num> in <year>
in normal hematopoiesis the myeloblast is an immature precursor of myeloid white blood cells a normal myeloblast will gradually mature into a mature white blood cell
in aml though a single myeloblast accumulates genetic changes which freeze the cell in its immature state and prevent differentiation
such a mutation alone does not cause leukemia however when such a differentiation arrest is combined with other mutations which disrupt genes controlling proliferation the result is the uncontrolled growth of an immature clone of cells leading to the clinical entity of aml
much of the diversity and heterogeneity of aml stems is because leukemic transformation can occur at a number of different steps along the differentiation pathway
modern classification schemes for aml recognize the characteristics and behavior of the leukemic cell and the leukemia may depend on the stage at which differentiation was halted
specific cytogenetic abnormalities can be found in many people with aml the types of chromosomal abnormalities often have prognostic significance
the chromosomal translocations encode abnormal fusion proteins usually transcription factors whose altered properties may cause the differentiation arrest
for example in acute promyelocytic leukemia the t <num> <num> translocation produces a pml @-@ rarα fusion protein which binds to the retinoic acid receptor element in the promoters of several myeloid @-@ specific genes and inhibits myeloid differentiation
the clinical signs and symptoms of aml result from the growth of leukemic clone cells which tends to displace or interfere with the development of normal blood cells in the bone marrow
this leads to neutropenia anemia and thrombocytopenia
the symptoms of aml are in turn often due to the low numbers of these normal blood elements
in rare cases people with aml can develop a chloroma or solid tumor of leukemic cells outside the bone marrow which can cause various symptoms depending on its location
an important pathophysiological mechanism of leukemogenesis in aml is the epigenetic induction of dedifferentiation by genetic mutations that alter the function of epigenetic enzymes such as the dna demethylase tet2 and the metabolic enzymes idh1 and idh2 which lead to the generation of a novel oncometabolite d @-@ <num> @-@ hydroxyglutarate which inhibits the activity of epigenetic enzymes such as tet2
the hypothesis is that such epigenetic mutations lead to the silencing of tumor suppressor genes and or the activation of proto @-@ oncogenes
the goal of induction therapy is to achieve a complete remission by reducing the number of leukemic cells to an undetectable level the goal of consolidation therapy is to eliminate any residual undetectable disease and achieve a cure
hematopoietic stem cell transplantation is usually considered if induction chemotherapy fails or after a person relapses although transplantation is also sometimes used as front @-@ line therapy for people with high @-@ risk disease
efforts to use tyrosine kinase inhibitors in aml continue
this induction chemotherapy regimen is known as <num> <num> or <num> <num> because the cytarabine is given as a continuous iv infusion for seven consecutive days while the anthracycline is given for three consecutive days as an iv push
up to <num> of people with aml will achieve a remission with this protocol
other alternative induction regimens including high @-@ dose cytarabine alone flag @-@ like regimens or investigational agents may also be used
because of the toxic effects of therapy including myelosuppression and an increased risk of infection induction chemotherapy may not be offered to the very elderly and the options may include less intense chemotherapy or palliative care
the <num> subtype of aml also known as acute promyelocytic leukemia apl is almost universally treated with the drug all @-@ trans @-@ retinoic acid atra in addition to induction chemotherapy usually an anthracycline
care must be taken to prevent disseminated intravascular coagulation dic complicating the treatment of apl when the promyelocytes release the contents of their granules into the peripheral circulation
apl is eminently curable with well @-@ documented treatment protocols
the goal of the induction phase is to reach a complete remission
complete remission does not mean the disease has been cured rather it signifies no disease can be detected with available diagnostic methods
complete remission is obtained in about <num> – <num> of newly diagnosed adults although this may vary based on the prognostic factors described above
the length of remission depends on the prognostic features of the original leukemia
in general all remissions will fail without additional consolidation therapy
if no further postremission or consolidation therapy is given almost all people with aml will eventually relapse
therefore more therapy is necessary to eliminate nondetectable disease and prevent relapse — that is to achieve a cure
the specific type of postremission therapy is individualized based on a person 's prognostic factors see above and general health
for good @-@ prognosis leukemias i
e
inv <num> t <num> <num> and t <num> <num> people will typically undergo an additional three to five courses of intensive chemotherapy known as consolidation chemotherapy
for people at high risk of relapse e
g
those with high @-@ risk cytogenetics underlying mds or therapy @-@ related aml allogeneic stem cell transplantation is usually recommended if the person is able to tolerate a transplant and has a suitable donor
the best postremission therapy for intermediate @-@ risk aml normal cytogenetics or cytogenetic changes not falling into good @-@ risk or high @-@ risk groups is less clear and depends on the specific situation including the age and overall health of the person the person 's values and whether a suitable stem cell donor is available
for people who are not eligible for a stem cell transplant immunotherapy with a combination of histamine dihydrochloride ceplene and interleukin <num> proleukin after the completion of consolidation has been shown to reduce the absolute relapse risk by <num> translating to a <num> increase in the likelihood of maintained remission
in <year> the monoclonal antibody @-@ linked cytotoxic agent gemtuzumab ozogamicin mylotarg was approved in the united states for people aged more than <num> years with relapsed aml who are not candidates for high @-@ dose chemotherapy
this drug was voluntarily withdrawn from the market by its manufacturer pfizer in <year>
since treatment options for relapsed aml are so limited palliative care or enrolment in a clinical trial may be offered
for relapsed acute promyelocytic leukemia apl arsenic trioxide is approved by the us fda
like atra arsenic trioxide does not work with other subtypes of aml
certain cytogenetic abnormalities are associated with very good outcomes for example the <num> <num> translocation in acute promyelocytic leukemia
about half of people with aml have normal cytogenetics they fall into an intermediate risk group
a number of other cytogenetic abnormalities are known to associate with a poor prognosis and a high risk of relapse after treatment
the first publication to address cytogenetics and prognosis was the mrc trial of <year> later the southwest oncology group and eastern cooperative oncology group and later still cancer and leukemia group b published other mostly overlapping lists of cytogenetics prognostication in leukemia
both of these entities are associated with a high rate of unfavorable cytogenetic abnormalities
as with most forms of cancer performance status i
e
the general physical condition and activity level of the person plays a major role in prognosis as well
however only flt3 @-@ itd npm1 cebpa and c @-@ kit are currently included in validated international risk stratification schema
these are expected to increase rapidly in the near future
flt3 internal tandem duplications itds have been shown to confer a poorer prognosis in aml with normal cytogenetics
several flt3 inhibitors have undergone clinical trials with mixed results
two other mutations npm1 and biallelic cebpa are associated with improved outcomes especially in people with normal cytogenetics and are used in current risk stratification algorithms
researchers are investigating the clinical significance of c @-@ kit mutations in aml
these are prevalent and potentially clinically relevant because of the availability of tyrosine kinase inhibitors such as imatinib and sunitinib that can block the activity of c @-@ kit pharmacologically
it is expected that additional markers e
g
runx1 asxl1 and tp53 that have consistently been associated with an inferior outcome will soon be included in these recommendations
the prognostic importance of other mutated genes e
g
dnmt3a idh1 idh2 is less clear
the overall cure rate for all people with aml including the elderly and those unable to tolerate aggressive therapy is likely lower
cure rates for promyelocytic leukemia can be as high as <num>
there are approximately <num> @,@ <num> new cases each year in the united states and the incidence rate has remained stable from <year> through <year>
aml accounts for <num>
<num> of all cancer deaths in the united states
the incidence of aml increases with age the median age at diagnosis is <num> years
aml accounts for about <num> of all acute leukemias in adults but is rare in children
the rate of therapy @-@ related aml that is aml caused by previous chemotherapy is rising therapy @-@ related disease currently accounts for about <num> – <num> of all cases of aml
aml is slightly more common in men with a male @-@ to @-@ female ratio of <num>
<num> <num>
there is some geographic variation in the incidence of aml
in adults the highest rates are seen in north america europe and oceania while adult aml is rarer in asia and latin america
in contrast childhood aml is less common in north america and india than in other parts of asia
these differences may be due to population genetics environmental factors or a combination of the two
velpeau noted the blood of this person had a consistency like gruel and speculated the appearance of the blood was due to white corpuscles
in <year> a series of people who died with enlarged spleens and changes in the colors and consistencies of their blood was reported by the edinburgh @-@ based pathologist j
h
bennett he used the term leucocythemia to describe this pathological condition
the term leukemia was coined by rudolf virchow the renowned german pathologist in <year>
as a pioneer in the use of the light microscope in pathology virchow was the first to describe the abnormal excess of white blood cells in people with the clinical syndrome described by velpeau and bennett
as virchow was uncertain of the etiology of the white blood cell excess he used the purely descriptive term leukemia greek white blood to refer to the condition
further advances in the understanding of acute myeloid leukemia occurred rapidly with the development of new technology
in <year> paul ehrlich developed a technique of staining blood films which allowed him to describe in detail normal and abnormal white blood cells
wilhelm ebstein introduced the term acute leukemia in <year> to differentiate rapidly progressive and fatal leukemias from the more indolent chronic leukemias
the term myeloid was coined by franz ernst christian neumann in <year> as he was the first to recognize white blood cells were made in the bone marrow greek µυєλός myelos bone marrow as opposed to the spleen
the technique of bone marrow examination to diagnose leukemia was first described in <year> by mosler
finally in <year> the myeloblast which is the malignant cell in aml was characterized by otto naegeli who divided the leukemias into myeloid and lymphocytic
in <year> aml became the first cancer genome to be fully sequenced
dna extracted from leukemic cells were compared to unaffected skin
the leukemic cells contained acquired mutations in several genes that had not previously been associated with the disease
how it is handled depends primarily on the type of leukemia
acute leukemias normally require prompt aggressive treatment despite significant risks of pregnancy loss and birth defects especially if chemotherapy is given during the developmentally sensitive first trimester

it consists of a christmas mix several remixes and an instrumental version of love me like you and another album track called lightning
the song is composed in the key of g major using common time and a tempo of <num> beats per minute
instrumentation is provided by vintage pianos bells and a pumping tenor sax
the use of percussion gives the a track a more modern style
during the track the band members vocal range spans one octave from the low note of d4 to the high note of e5
the song opens with the group harmonising sha la la la over pianos
the lyrics are about puppy love as they yearningly sing last night i lay in bed so blue cause i realized the truth they can 't love me like you i tried to find somebody new baby they ain 't got a clue can 't love me like you
fuse writer jeff benjamin described the song as being reminiscent of <num> girl group the ronettes but with a more modern feel for <year> radio highlighting the line they try to romance me but you got that nasty and that 's what i want as an example
digital spy writer lewis corner thought that the line he might got the biggest ca @-@ aa @-@ ar does not fool listeners into thinking that they 're not actually talking about his fiat <num>
several music critics compared the song to recordings from the motown era in the <num> and <num> with andy gill of the independent likening it to material composed by shadow morton
emilee lindner of mtv news likened the production to material composed by phil spector
the christmas mix version features added church bells and jingles
writing for nme nick levine thought that love me like you was reminiscent of songs recorded by stooshe but added that little mix performed the motown style without the forced sense of fun
similarly billboard writer malorie macall and digital spy critic jack klompus likened the retro style to songs performed by meghan trainor and the supremes respectively
music times writer carolyn menyes praised its composition for being charming and described the track as totally charming

the video takes place at a school dance where a professor in the hall the same man who appeared in their previous single 's video black magic tells everyone that it is the last dance
jade leigh @-@ anne jesy and perrie are waiting for their dates to arrive
scenes of the girls waiting for their date are intercut throughout the video of them sitting at a table while all of the other couples are dancing
unbeknownst to them the man played by hector david junior has invited each of them to go to the dance after meeting them in different situations prior to that night
he asked jade by picking her up in his car to go on a date
as she gets in he invites her to be his date at the dance and presents her with a corsage to wear on her wrist on the night
he mets leigh @-@ anne at a high school basketball game where she and her girlfriends were watching him and some other boys play on the court
he sees that she is infatuated by how good he is at the sport walks up to her and asks her to be his date by giving her a corsage
he asked jesy to be his date while they were at the cinema as they shared a bucket of popcorn
as he gives her the corsage she throws the bucket over her shoulder and eagerly jumps on his lap causing them to fall off the chair
finally he invited perrie to be his date after she fell off her bike while staring at him work out on a field and pouring water over his torso to cool down
he helps her up and gives her a corsage
toward the end of the video they sit on a bench next to the entrance and see their date walk in with another girl wearing the same corsage as the ones that he had given each of them
they realise that they have all been two @-@ timed by the same guy and are all dateless
it ends with the girls being each other 's date and solemnly dancing whilst everyone else has a good time
metro writer rebecca lewis noted that the man in the video strongly resembled perrie 's former fiancé zayn malik of one direction

his primary fields of research are the israeli – palestinian conflict and the politics of the holocaust an interest motivated by the experiences of his parents who were jewish holocaust survivors
he is a graduate of binghamton university and received his ph
d in political science at princeton university
he has held faculty positions at brooklyn college rutgers university hunter college new york university and depaul university where he was an assistant professor from <year> to <year>
in <year> after a highly publicized feud between finkelstein and an academic opponent alan dershowitz finkelstein 's tenure bid at depaul was denied
finkelstein was placed on administrative leave for the <year> – <year> academic year and on september <num> <year> he announced his resignation after coming to a settlement with the university on generally undisclosed terms
an official statement from depaul strongly defended the decision to deny finkelstein tenure stated that outside influence played no role in the decision
in <year> he was banned from entering israel for <num> years
finkelstein taught at sakarya university middle east institute in turkey between <year> and <year>
his mother maryla husyt grew up in warsaw survived the warsaw ghetto the majdanek concentration camp and two slave labor camps
her first husband died in the war
she considered the day of her liberation as the most horrible day of her life as she realized that she was alone her parents and siblings gone
norman 's father zacharias finkelstein active in hashomer hatzair was a survivor of both the warsaw ghetto and the auschwitz concentration camp
after the war they met in a displaced persons camp in linz austria and then emigrated to the united states where his father became a factory worker and his mother a homemaker and later a bookkeeper
finkelstein 's mother was an ardent pacifist
both his parents died in <year>
of his parents finkelstein has recalled that they saw the world through the prism of the nazi holocaust
they were eternally indebted to the soviet union to whom they attributed the defeat of the nazis and so anyone who was anti @-@ soviet they were extremely harsh on
they supported the soviet union 's approval of the creation of the state of israel as enunciated by gromyko who stated that the jews had earned the right to a state but thought that israel had sold its soul to the west and refused to have any truck with it
finkelstein grew up in borough park then mill basin both in brooklyn new york where he attended james madison high school
in his memoir finkelstein recalls his strong youthful identification with the outrage that his mother witness to the genocidal atrocities of world war ii felt at the carnage wrought by the united states in vietnam
one childhood friend recalls his mother 's emotional investment in left @-@ wing humanitarian causes as bordering on hysteria
he had internalized her indignation a trait which he admits rendered him insufferable when talking of the vietnam war and which imbued him with a holier @-@ than @-@ thou attitude at the time which he now regrets
but finkelstein regards his absorption of his mother 's outlook — the refusal to put aside a sense of moral outrage in order to get on with one 's life — as a virtue
subsequently his reading of noam chomsky played an important role in tailoring the passion bequeathed to him by his mother to the necessity of maintaining intellectual rigor
finkelstein completed his undergraduate studies at binghamton university in new york in <year> after which he studied at the école pratique des hautes études in paris
a deep admirer of paul sweezy he was an ardent maoist and was devastated by the news of the trial of the gang of four an event which totally devastated him and led him to abandon marxism – leninism
finkelstein received his master 's degree in political science in <year> and later his phd in political studies from princeton
his doctoral thesis was on zionism
before gaining academic employment finkelstein was a part @-@ time social worker with teenage dropouts in new york
he then taught successively at rutgers university new york university brooklyn college and hunter college and at depaul university in chicago
during the first intifada he spent every summer from <year> in the west bank a guest of palestinian families in hebron and beit sahour
according to the new york times finkelstein left hunter college in <year> after his teaching load and salary were reduced by the college administration
in his own recollection he enjoyed teaching at hunter <year> – <year> and was unceremoniously kicked out of the school after begging them to keep him on with just two courses a semester <num> @,@ <num> a year
hunter set conditions that would have required him to spend four days a week which he thought unacceptable
beginning with his doctoral thesis at princeton finkelstein 's career has been marked by controversy
a self @-@ described forensic scholar he has written sharply critical academic reviews of several prominent writers and scholars whom he accuses of misrepresenting the documentary record in order to defend israel 's policies and practices
his writings have dealt with politically charged topics such as zionism the demographic history of palestine and his allegations of the existence of a holocaust industry that exploits the memory of the holocaust to further israeli and financial interests
citing linguist and political activist noam chomsky as an example finkelstein notes that it is possible to unite exacting scholarly rigor with scathing moral outrage and supporters and detractors alike have remarked on the polemical style of finkelstein 's work
its content has been praised by eminent historians such as raul hilberg and avi shlaim as well as chomsky
finkelstein has described himself as an old @-@ fashioned communist in the sense that he see s no value whatsoever in states
peters 's history and defense of israel deals with the demographic history of palestine
demographic studies had tended to assert that the arab population of ottoman @-@ controlled palestine a <num> majority at the turn of the century had dwindled towards parity due to massive zionist immigration
peters radically challenged this picture by arguing that a substantial part of the palestinian people were descended from immigrants from other arab countries from the early <num> century onwards
it followed for peters and many of her readers that the picture of a native palestinian population overwhelmed by jewish immigration was little more than propaganda and that in actuality two almost simultaneous waves of immigration met in what had been a relatively unpopulated land
from time immemorial had been praised by figures as varied as barbara tuchman theodore h
white elie wiesel and lucy dawidowicz
saul bellow for one wrote in a jacket endorsement that millions of people the world over smothered by false history and propaganda will be grateful for this clear account of the origins of the palestinians
finkelstein asserted that the book was a monumental hoax
he later opined that while peters 's book received widespread interest and approval in the united states a scholarly demonstration of its fraudulence and unreliability aroused little attention by the end of <year> from time immemorial had
received some two hundred favorable notices
in the united states
the only false notes in this crescendoing chorus of praise were the journal of palestine studies which ran a highly critical review by bill farrell the small chicago @-@ based newsweekly in these times which published a condensed version of this writer 's findings and alexander cockburn who devoted a series of columns in the nation exposing the hoax
the periodicals in which from time immemorial had already been favorably reviewed refused to run any critical correspondence e
g
the new republic the atlantic monthly commentary
periodicals that had yet to review the book rejected a manuscript on the subject as of little or no consequence e
g
the village voice dissent the new york review of books
not a single national newspaper or columnist contacted found newsworthy that a best @-@ selling effusively praised study of the middle east conflict was a threadbare hoax
noam chomsky later reminisced i warned him if you follow this you 're going to get in trouble — because you 're going to expose the american intellectual community as a gang of frauds and they are not going to like it and they 're going to destroy you
in <year> the new york review of books published yehoshua porath 's review and an exchange with critics of the review in which he criticized the assumptions and evidence on which peters 's thesis relied thus lending independent support from an expert in palestinian demographics to finkelstein 's doctoral critique
in the house journal of the american council on foreign relations foreign affairs william b
quandt the edward stettinius professor of politics at the university of virginia and authority on middle eastern politics later described finkelstein 's critique of from time immemorial as a landmark essay and a victory to his credit in its demonstration of the shoddy scholarship of peters book
israeli historian avi shlaim later praised finkelstein 's thesis saying that it had established his credentials when he was still a doctoral student
in shlaim 's view finkelstein had produced an unanswerable case with irrefutable evidence proving that peters book was both preposterous and worthless
according to noam chomsky the controversy that surrounded finkelstein 's research caused a delay in his earning his ph
d
at princeton university
chomsky wrote in understanding power that finkelstein literally could not get the faculty to read his dissertation and that princeton eventually granted finkelstein his doctorate only out of embarrassment for princeton but refused to give him any further professional backing
finkelstein published portions of his thesis in the following publications disinformation and the palestine question the not @-@ so @-@ strange case of joan peters 's from time immemorial chapter <num> of blaming the victims spurious scholarship and the palestinian question <year> and a land without a people joan peters wilderness image chapter <num> of image and reality of the israel @-@ palestine conflict <year>
here finkelstein argues that elie wiesel and others exploit the memory of the holocaust as an ideological weapon
the purpose writes finkelstein is to enable the state of israel one of the world 's most formidable military powers with a horrendous human rights record to cast itself as a victim state that is to provide israel immunity to criticism
he alleges what he calls a double shakedown by a repellent gang of plutocrats hoodlums and hucksters seeking enormous legal damages and financial settlements from germany and switzerland moneys which then go to the lawyers and institutional actors involved in procuring them rather than actual holocaust survivors
the book received a hostile reception in some quarters with critics charging that it was poorly researched and or allowed others to exploit it for antisemitic purposes
the german historian hans mommsen disparaged the first edition as a most trivial book which appeals to easily aroused anti @-@ semitic prejudices
israeli holocaust historian israel gutman called the book a lampoon stating this is not research it isn 't even political literature
i don 't even think it should be reviewed or critiqued as a legitimate book
the book was also harshly criticized by brown university professor omer bartov and university of chicago professor peter novick
however preeminent holocaust scholar raul hilberg said the book expressed views hilberg himself subscribed to in substance in that he too found the exploitation of the holocaust as finkelstein describes detestable
asked on another occasion if finkelstein 's analysis might play into the hands of neo @-@ nazis for antisemitic purposes hilberg replied well even if they do use it in that fashion i 'm afraid that when it comes to the truth it has to be said openly without regard to any consequences that would be undesirable embarrassing
other critics claim finkelstein 's evidence is highly selective and or dubious and that his arguments would be based on a misinterpretation of history and a questionable use of sources
the historian david cesarani wrote that while finkelstein absolves swiss banks of serious misconduct towards holocaust survivors and depicts them as victims of a jewish terror based on a sentence from an important report annex he had ignored the report body which describes deceitful actions by swiss banks inappropriate closing of accounts failure to keep adequate records and so on
during a debate on democracy now finkelstein asserted that dershowitz lacked knowledge about specific contents of his own book
he also claimed that dershowitz did not write the book and may not have even read it
finkelstein noted <num> instances in as many pages where dershowitz 's book cites the same sources and passages used by joan peters in her book in largely the same sequence with ellipses in the same places
in two instances dershowitz reproduces peters 's errors see below
from this finkelstein concluded that dershowitz had not checked the original sources himself contrary to the latter 's claims
finkelstein suggests that this copying of quotations amounts to copying ideas
examining a copy of a proof of dershowitz 's book he managed to obtain he found evidence that dershowitz had his secretarial assistant holly beth billington check in the harvard library the sources he had read in peters 's book
dershowitz answered the charge in a letter to the university of california 's press director lynne withey arguing that finkelstein had made up the smoking gun quotation in that he had changed its wording from cite to copy in his book
in public debate he has stated that if somebody borrowed the quote without going to check back on whether mark twain had said that obviously that would be a serious charge however he insisted emphatically that he himself did not do that that he had indeed checked the original source by twain
dershowitz threatened libel action over the charges in finkelstein 's book as a consequence of which the publisher deleted the word plagiarism from the text before publication
finkelstein agreed to remove the suggestion that dershowitz was not the true author of the case for israel because as the publisher said he couldn 't document that
asserting that he did consult the original sources dershowitz said finkelstein is simply accusing him of good scholarly practice citing references he learned of initially from peters 's book
dershowitz denies that he used any of peters 's ideas without citation
plagiarism is taking someone else 's words and claiming they 're your own
there are no borrowed words from anybody
there are no borrowed ideas from anybody because i fundamentally disagree with the conclusions of peters 's book
in a footnote in the case for israel which cites peters 's book dershowitz explicitly denies that he relies on peters for conclusions or data
in their joint interview on democracy now however finkelstein cited specific passages in dershowitz 's book in which a phrase that he says peters coined was incorrectly attributed to george orwell peters coins the phrase turnspeak she says she 's using it as a play off of george orwell which as all listeners know used the phrase newspeak
she coined her own phrase turnspeak
you go to mr
dershowitz 's book he got so confused in his massive borrowings from joan peters that on two occasions i 'll cite them for those who have a copy of the book on page <num> and on page <num> he uses the phrase quote george orwell 's turnspeak
turnspeak is not orwell mr
dershowitz you 're the felix frankfurter chair at harvard you must know that orwell would never use such a clunky phrase as turnspeak
james o
freedman the former president of dartmouth college the university of iowa and the american academy of arts and sciences has defended dershowitz i do not understand finkelstein 's charge of plagiarism against alan dershowitz
there is no claim that dershowitz used the words of others without attribution
when he uses the words of others he quotes them properly and generally cites them to the original sources mark twain palestine royal commission etc
finkelstein 's complaint is that instead he should have cited them to the secondary source in which dershowitz may have come upon them
but as the chicago manual of style emphasizes importance of attribution
with all reuse of others materials it is important to identify the original as the source
this not only bolsters the claims of fair use it also helps avoid any accusation of plagiarism
this is precisely what dershowitz did
responding to an article in the nation by alexander cockburn dershowitz also cited the chicago manual of style cockburn 's claim is that some of the quotes should not have been cited to their original sources but rather to a secondary source where he believes i stumbled upon them
even if he were correct that i found all these quotations in peters 's book the preferred method of citation is to the original source as the chicago manual of style emphasizes with all reuse of others materials it is important to identify the original as the source
this
helps avoid any accusation of plagiarism
to cite a source from a secondary source quoted in
is generally to be discouraged

to which cockburn responded quoting the chicago manual of style dershowitz artfully implies that he followed the rules by citing the original as opposed to the secondary source peters
he misrepresents chicago here where the original means merely the origin of the borrowed material which is in this instance peters
now look at the second bit of the quote from chicago chastely separated from the preceding sentence by a demure three @-@ point ellipsis
as my associate kate levin has discovered this passage to cite a source from a secondary source
occurs on page <num> which is no less than <num> pages later than the material before the ellipsis in a section titled citations taken from secondary sources
here 's the full quote with what dershowitz left out set in bold quoted in
to cite a source from a secondary source quoted in is generally to be discouraged since authors are expected to have examined the works they cite
if an original source is unavailable however both the original and the secondary source must be listed
so chicago is clearly insisting that unless dershowitz went to the originals he was obliged to cite peters
finkelstein has conclusively demonstrated that he didn 't go to the originals
plagiarism qed plus added time for willful distortion of the language of chicago 's guidelines cobbling together two separate discussions
on behalf of dershowitz harvard law school dean elena kagan asked former harvard president derek bok to investigate the assertion of plagiarism bok exonerated dershowitz of the charge
in an april <num> <year> interview with the harvard crimson dershowitz confirmed that he had sent a letter last september to depaul faculty members lobbying against finkelstein 's tenure
in april <year> dr
frank menetrez a former editor @-@ in @-@ chief of the ucla law review published an analysis of the charges made against finkelstein by dershowitz finding no merit in any single charge and concluding that dershowitz had misrepresented matters
in a follow @-@ up analysis he concluded that he could find no way of avoiding the inference that dershowitz copied the quotation from twain from peters 's from time immemorial and not from the original source as dershowitz claimed
in an interview given for the film american radical the trials of norman finkelstein in <year> dershowitz said of finkelstein i don 't think he is a jew
he 's jewish only on his parents side
de paul 's political science committee investigated his accusations against finkelstein and concluded that they were not based on legitimate criticism
the department subsequently invited john mearsheimer and ian lustick two independent academics with known expertise on the israel – palestine conflict to evaluate the academic merit of finkelstein 's work they came to the same conclusion
also in <year> the washington post noted the adl repeatedly accused norman finkelstein of being a holocaust denier and that these charges have proved baseless
finkelstein 's mother survived the majdanek concentration camp his father survived the auschwitz concentration camp and most of his family died in the holocaust in early <year> the depaul political science department voted nine to three and the college of liberal arts and sciences personnel committee five to zero in favor of giving finkelstein tenure
the three opposing faculty members subsequently filed a minority report opposing tenure supported by the dean of the college chuck suchar
suchar stated he opposed tenure because finkelstein 's personal and reputation demeaning attacks on dershowitz benny morris and the holocaust authors elie wiesel and jerzy kosinski were inconsistent with depaul 's vincentian values as examples of the latter suchar argued that finkelstein lacked respect for the dignity of the individual and for the rights of others to hold and express different intellectual positions
amidst considerable public debate dershowitz actively campaigned to block finkelstein 's tenure bid
in june <year> a <num> – <num> vote by depaul university 's board on promotion and tenure a faculty board affirmed by the university 's president the rev
dennis holtschneider denied finkelstein tenure
the university denied that dershowitz who had been criticized for his campaign against finkelstein 's tenure played any part in this decision
at the same time the university denied tenure to international studies assistant professor mehrene larudee a strong supporter of finkelstein despite unanimous support from her department the personnel committee and the dean
finkelstein stated that he would engage in civil disobedience if attempts were made to bar him from teaching his students
the faculty council later affirmed the right of professors finkelstein and larudee to appeal which a university lawyer said was not possible
council president anne bartlett said she was terribly concerned correct procedure was not followed
depaul 's faculty association considered taking no @-@ confidence votes on administrators including the president because of the tenure denials
in a statement issued upon finkelstein 's resignation depaul called him a prolific scholar and an outstanding teacher
dershowitz expressed outrage at the compromise and this statement in particular saying that the university had traded truth for peace
in june <year> after two weeks of protests some depaul students staged a sit @-@ in and hunger strike in support of both professors denied tenure
the illinois conference of the american association of university professors also sent a letter to the university 's president stating it is entirely illegitimate for a university to deny tenure to a professor out of fear that his published research
might hurt a college 's reputation and that the association has explicitly rejected collegiality as an appropriate criterion for evaluating faculty members
in a <year> interview professor matthew abraham author of out of bounds academic freedom and the question of palestine described the finkelstein tenure case as one of the most significant academic freedom cases in the last fifty years claiming the case demonstrated the substantial pressure outside parties can place on a mid @-@ tier religious institution when the perspectives advanced by a controversial scholar threaten dominant interests
finkelstein had previously visited south lebanon and met with lebanese families during the <year> lebanon war
he was banned from entering israel for <num> years
finkelstein was questioned after his arrival at ben gurion airport near tel aviv and detained for <num> hours in a holding cell
after speaking to israeli attorney michael sfard he was placed on a flight back to amsterdam his point of origin
in an interview with haaretz finkelstein stated i did my best to provide absolutely candid and comprehensive answers to all the questions put to me
i am confident that i have nothing to hide
no suicide missions or secret rendezvous with terrorist organizations
he had been travelling to visit friends in the west bank and stated he had no interest in visiting israel
sfard said banning finkelstein from entering the country recalls the behavior of the soviet bloc countries
the authors whose work he has thus targeted including daniel jonah goldhagen and dershowitz along with others such as benny morris whose work finkelstein has also cited in his scholarship have in turn accused finkelstein of grossly misrepresenting their work and selectively quoting from their books
according to raul hilberg finkelstein displays academic courage to speak the truth when no one else is out there to support him
i would say that his place in the whole history of writing history is assured and that those who in the end are proven right triumph and he will be among those who will have triumphed albeit it so seems at great cost
in a peer review for beyond chutzpah avi shlaim said that finkelstein has a most impressive track record in exposing spurious american @-@ jewish scholarship on the arab @-@ israeli conflict
he praised finkelstein for all the sterling qualities for which he has become famous erudition originality spark meticulous attention to detail intellectual integrity courage and formidable forensic skills
sara roy stated that her shared experience with finkelstein as a child of holocaust survivors engaged in research on the palestinian @-@ israeli conflict gave her a unique position to comment
according to roy finkelstein 's scholarship is exceptional both for its brilliance and rigor
in the fields of middle eastern studies and political science his work is considered seminal and there is no doubt that both disciplines would be intellectually weaker without it
norman 's power and value however do not emanate only from his scholarship but from his character
his life ’ s work shaped largely but not entirely by his experience as a child of survivors has been and continues to be informed by a profound concern with human dignity and the danger of dehumanization
the israeli newspaper haaretz stated that i t is difficult to sympathize with finkelstein 's opinions and preferences especially since he decided to support hezbollah meet with its fighters and visit the graves of some of its slain operatives
still it continued to say that he should not be banned from entering israel because meetings with hezbollah operatives do not in themselves constitute a security risk
it has been screened in amsterdam idfa in toronto hot docs and in more than <num> other national and international venues it received a freshness rating of <num> on film review aggregator rotten tomatoes
the same year finkelstein appeared in defamation hebrew השמצה translit
hashmatsa a documentary film by award @-@ winning israeli filmmaker yoav shamir
the first sources are responses from those whose work finkelstein has discussed
daniel goldhagen whose book hitler 's willing executioners finkelstein criticized claimed his scholarship has everything to do with his burning political agenda
alan dershowitz has written that peter novick professor of history at the university of chicago and a noted holocaust historian whose work finkelstein says inspired the holocaust industry has strongly criticized the latter 's work describing it as trash
similarly dershowitz whose book the case for israel and finkelstein 's response beyond chutzpah sparked an ongoing feud between the two has claimed finkelstein 's complicity in a conspiracy against pro @-@ israel scholars the mode of attack is consistent
chomsky selects the target and directs finkelstein to probe the writings in minute detail and conclude that the writer didn 't actually write the work that it is plagiarized that it is a hoax and a fraud arguing that finkelstein has leveled charges against many academics calling at least <num> distinguished jews hucksters hoaxters sic thieves extortionists and worse
although the back and forth between finkelstein and dershowitz received the most attention and attracted significant controversy finkelstein has maintained that the real issue is israel 's human rights record
israeli historian omer bartov writing for the new york times book review judged the holocaust industry to be marred by the same errors he denounces in those who exploit the holocaust for profit or politics it is filled with precisely the kind of shrill hyperbole that finkelstein rightly deplores in much of the current media hype over the holocaust it is brimming with the same indifference to historical facts inner contradictions strident politics and dubious contextualizations and it oozes with the same smug sense of moral and intellectual superiority
like any conspiracy theory it contains several grains of truth and like any such theory it is both irrational and insidious
finkelstein has accused journalist jeffrey goldberg of torturing or being an accessory to torture of palestinian prisoners during his idf service in the first intifada based on statements made in goldberg 's book prisoners
finkelstein says that goldberg admits to personally sending prisoners to the zinzana which he says has been repeatedly condemned as torture in human rights reports
goldberg referred to the allegation as ridiculous and he had never laid a hand on anybody
goldberg said his principal role was making sure prisoners had fresh fruit
he characterized finkelstein as a ridiculous figure and accused him of lying and purposely misreading my book
discussing finkelstein 's book beyond chutzpah israeli historian avi shlaim stated that finkelstein 's critique of israel is based on an amazing amount of research
he seems to have read everything
he has gone through the reports of israeli groups of human rights groups human rights watch and peace now and b 'tselem all of the reports of amnesty international
and he deploys all this evidence from israeli and other sources in order to sustain his critique of israeli practices israeli violations of human rights of the palestinians israeli house demolitions the targeted assassinations of palestinian militants the cutting down of trees the building of the wall — the security barrier on the west bank which is illegal — the restrictions imposed on the palestinians in the west bank and so on and so forth
i find his critique extremely detailed well @-@ documented and accurate
in a telephone interview with today 's zaman in <year> finkelstein stated i think israel as a number of commentators pointed out is becoming an insane state
and we have to be honest about that
while the rest of the world wants peace europe wants peace the us wants peace but this state wants war war and war
in the first week of the massacres there were reports in the israeli press that israel did not want to put all its ground forces in gaza because it was preparing attacks on iran
then there were reports it was planning attacks on lebanon
it is a lunatic state
when asked how he as the son of holocaust survivors felt about israel ’ s operation in gaza finkelstein replied it has been a long time since i felt any emotional connection with the state of israel which relentlessly and brutally and inhumanly keeps these vicious murderous wars
it is a vandal state
there is a russian writer who once described vandal states as genghis khan with a telegraph
israel is genghis khan with a computer
i feel no emotion of affinity with that state
i have some good friends and their families there and of course i would not want any of them to be hurt
that said sometimes i feel that israel has come out of the boils sic of the hell a satanic state
the anti @-@ defamation league has described finkelstein as an obsessive anti @-@ zionist filled with vitriolic hatred of zionism and israel
on being called an anti @-@ zionist finkelstein has said it 's a superficial term
i am opposed to any state with an ethnic character not only to israel
finkelstein is an advocate of a two @-@ state solution to the israeli @-@ palestinian conflict
he also condemned what he said was israel 's refusal to abide by international law and to abide by the opinion of the international community to settle the conflict
i was of course happy to meet the hizbullah people because it is a point of view that is rarely heard in the united states
i have no problem saying that i do want to express solidarity with them and i am not going to be a coward of sic a hypocrite about it
i don 't care about hizbullah as a political organization
i don 't know much about their politics and anyhow it 's irrelevant
i don 't live in lebanon
it 's a choice that the lebanese have to make who they want to be their leaders who they want to represent them
but there is a fundamental principle
people have the right to defend their country from foreign occupiers and people have the right to defend their country from invaders who are destroying their country
that to me is a very basic elementary and uncomplicated question
while condemning the targeting of civilians to achieve a political goal finkelstein has stated he believes hezbollah has the right to target israeli civilians as long as israel persists in targeting lebanese civilians until israel ceases its terrorist acts
finkelstein claims that an equivalence exists between hamas and the state of israel in regards to the military policy of targeted killings during the second intifada
according to finkelstein the record shows that israel has routinely targeted civilians for killing and israel indiscriminately kills civilians
he concludes that the argument among human rights organizations at any rate is that
in effect there ’ s no difference between indiscriminately killing civilians and targeting civilians
finkelstein argued one of israel 's primary motivations for launching the <year> offensive in gaza was that hamas was signaling that it wanted a diplomatic settlement of the conflict along the june <year> border
finkelstein believes hamas had joined the international community in seeking a diplomatic settlement and describes hamas 's stance towards israel prior to the war as a peace offensive
finkelstein stated that i think the solidarity movement has the right tactics
i support the bds
but i said it will never reach a broad public until and unless they are explicit on their goal
and their goal has to include recognition of israel otherwise it 's a nonstarter
elsewhere he has stated that he supports a lowercase bds making the same point about tactics and goals
in february <year> the jewish chronicle in england stated that finkelstein launched a blistering attack on the bds movement saying it was a hypocritical dishonest cult l ike the munchkin cult in oz that tries to cleverly pose as human rights activists while in reality their goal is to destroy israel
finkelstein stated that the bds movement has had very few successes and that just like a cult the leaders pretend that they are hugely successful when in reality the general public rejects their extreme views
in june <year> in an appearance on democracy now finkelstein elaborated on his criticisms of the bds movement the problem as i see it with the bds movement is not the tactic
who could not support boycott divestment and sanctions of course you should
and most of the human rights organizations church organizations have moved in that direction
the problem is the goal
the official bds movement they claim to be agnostic neutral — whatever term you want to use — on the question of israel
you can ’ t reach a broad public if you are agnostic on the question of israel
the broad public wants to know where do you stand and if you claim not to have a stand you lose them
the bds movement it always says and i ’ m using their language we are a rights @-@ based organization
we are based in international law
i agree with that
that ’ s where you have to go rights @-@ based international law
but the international law is clear
you read the last sentence of the <year> international court of justice opinion on the wall that israel has been building in the west bank and the last sentence says we look forward to two states a palestinian state alongside israel and at peace with its neighbors
that 's the law
and if you want to go past that law or ignore the israel part you ’ ll never reach a broad public
and then it 's a cult
then it ’ s pointless in my opinion
we 're wasting time
and it 's only a wasting of time
it becomes — and i know it 's a strong word and i hope i won 't be faulted for it but it becomes historically criminal because there was a time where whatever we said it made no difference
nobody was listening
you could shout whatever you want — who cares but now actually we can reach people
there is a possibility
i ’ m not saying a certainty
i 'm not even saying a probability
but there is a possibility that we can reach a broad public
and so we have to be very careful about the words we use and we have to be very careful about the political strategy we map out
otherwise we 're going to squander a real opportunity
and i don 't want to squander it

a saprobic species it is typically found growing on the ground singly or in small groups on woody debris or leaf litter during summer and autumn in japan europe and eastern north america
the fruit body begins its development in an egg form resembling somewhat a puffball partially submerged in the ground
as the fungus matures a slender orange to pink colored stalk emerges that tapers evenly to a pointed tip
the stalk is covered with a foul @-@ smelling slimy green spore mass on the upper third of its length
flies and other insects feed upon the slime which contains the spores assisting in their dispersal
due to their repellent odor mature specimens are not generally considered edible although there are reports of the immature eggs being consumed
in the laboratory mutinus elegans has been shown to inhibit the growth of several microorganisms that can be pathogenic to humans
it was first characterized scientifically by french scientist jean pierre françois camille montagne in <year> who called it corynites elegans
the genus name mutinus refers to a phallic deity mutinus mutunus one of the roman di indigetes placated by roman brides
the species is commonly known variously as the elegant stinkhorn the headless stinkhorn the dog stinkhorn or the devil 's dipstick

the stalk is hollow and strongly wrinkled overall its shape is cylindrical below but it gradually tapers to a narrow apex with a small opening at the tip
the upper half of the stalk is bright red to reddish orange and the color gradually loses intensity transforming into pinkish white below
the stalk may be straight or slightly curved
a gelatinous greenish @-@ brown gleba covers the upper third of the stalk in newly emerged specimens
the remains of the egg forms a volva around the base of the stalk
the odor of the gleba is foul one author describes it as sickly sweet or metallic
the spores are a greenish @-@ brown color
fruit bodies are attached to the substrate by whitish rhizomorphs that resemble plant roots
american mycologist smith noted that the eggs are often slow to open sometimes taking up to two weeks before the stalk expands
the spores are <num> – <num> by <num> – <num> µm oblong @-@ elliptical smooth and embedded in the gleba

the hilar scar is a circular indentation at one end of the spore and it most likely results during the separation of the attachment of the spore to the sterigma of the basidium

as described in the old testament books exodus and deuteronomy the commandments form part of a covenant offered by god to the israelites to free them from the spiritual slavery of sin
according to the catechism of the catholic church — the official exposition of the catholic church 's christian beliefs — the commandments are considered essential for spiritual good health and growth and serve as the basis for catholic social justice
a review of the commandments is one of the most common types of examination of conscience used by catholics before receiving the sacrament of penance
the commandments appear in the earliest church writings the catechism states that they have occupied a predominant place in teaching the faith since the time of augustine of hippo ad <num> – <num>
the church had no official standards for religious instruction until the fourth lateran council in <num> evidence suggests the commandments were used in christian education in the early church and throughout the middle ages but with inconsistent emphasis
the lack of instruction in them by some dioceses formed the basis of one of the criticisms launched against the church by protestant reformers
afterward the first church @-@ wide catechism in <year> provided thorough discussions of each commandment but gave greater emphasis to the seven sacraments
the most recent catechism devotes a large section to interpret each of the commandments
church teaching of the commandments is largely based on the old and new testaments and the writings of the early church fathers
in the new testament jesus acknowledged their validity and instructed his disciples to go further demanding a righteousness exceeding that of the scribes and pharisees
summarized by jesus into two great commandments that teach love of god and love of neighbor they instruct individuals on their relationships with both
the first three commandments demand respect for god 's name observation of the lord 's day and prohibit the worship of other gods
the others deal with the relationships between individuals such as that between parent and child they include prohibitions against lying stealing murdering adultery and covetousness
the old testament does not make clear how the texts should be divided to arrive at ten commandments
the division traditionally used by the catholic and lutheran churches was first derived by the latin church father augustine of hippo <num> – <num> in his book questions on exodus
other christian churches such as the eastern orthodox and some protestant churches use a form established by the greek fathers
the two forms have slightly different numbering but maintain exactly the same substance despite protestant accusations to the contrary
jewish numbering differs from christian denominations in that it considers what many christians call a prologue to be the entire first commandment
they first appear in the book of exodus according to which moses acting under the orders of god freed the israelites from physical slavery in egypt
according to church teaching god offered a covenant — which included the ten commandments — to also free them from the spiritual slavery of sin
some historians have described this as the central event in the history of ancient israel
the coming of jesus is seen by the catholic church as the fulfillment of the destiny of the jews who were chosen according to peter kreeft to show the true god to the world
jesus acknowledged the commandments and instructed his followers to go further requiring in kreeft 's words more not less a righteousness which exceeds that of the scribes and pharisees
explaining church teaching kreeft states the commandments are to the moral order what the creation story in genesis <num> is to the natural order
they are god 's order conquering chaos
they are not man 's ideas about god but god 's ideas about man
the church teaches that jesus freed people from keeping the burdensome jewish law torah or mosaic law with its <num> distinct regulations but not from the obligation to keep the ten commandments because the ten were written with the finger of god unlike those written by moses
this teaching was reaffirmed at the council of trent <year> – <year> and at the second vatican council <year> – <year>
although it is uncertain what role the ten commandments played in early christian worship evidence suggests they were recited during some services and used in christian education
for example the commandments are included in one of the earliest christian writings known as the teaching of the twelve apostles or the didache
scholars contend that the commandments were highly regarded by the early church as a summary of god 's law
the protestant scholar klaus bockmuehl believes that the church replaced the commandments with lists of virtues and vices such as the seven deadly sins from <num> – <num>
other scholars contend that throughout church history the commandments have been used as an examination of conscience and that many theologians have written about them
while evidence exists that the commandments were part of catechesis in monasteries and other venues there was no official church position to promote specific methods of religious instruction during the middle ages
the fourth lateran council <num> was the first attempt to remedy this problem
surviving evidence reveals that some bishops efforts to implement the council 's resolutions included special emphasis on teaching the commandments in their respective dioceses
centuries later the lack of instruction in them by some dioceses formed the basis of one of the criticisms launched against the church by protestant reformers
catechisms produced in specific dioceses from the mid @-@ fourteenth century emphasized the commandments and laid the foundation for the first official church @-@ wide catechism the <year> roman catechism
commissioned by the council of trent it provided thorough discussions of each commandment but gave greater emphasis to the seven sacraments to emphasize the catholic belief that christian life was dependent upon the grace solely obtained through the sacramental life provided by the catholic church
this emphasis conflicted with protestant beliefs which held the commandments as the source of divine grace
while more recent papal encyclicals offer interpretations of church teaching on individual commandments throughout history official church teachings on the commandments are based on their mentions in the old and new testaments and the writings of the early church fathers origen irenaeus and augustine
later theologians thomas aquinas and bonaventure offered notable commentaries on the commandments
aquinas a doctor of the church considered them to be the primary precepts of justice and all law and natural reason gives immediate assent to them as being plainly evident principles
the most recent catechism of the catholic church — the official summary of church beliefs — devotes a large section to the commandments which serve as the basis for catholic social teaching
according to the catechism the church has given them a predominant place in teaching the faith since the fifth century
kreeft explains that the church regards them as a path of life and a path to freedom just as a schoolyard fence protects children from life @-@ threatening dangers
the catechism explains that this prohibits idolatry providing examples of forbidden practices such as the worship of any creature and of demons
power pleasure race ancestors the state and money
augustine interpreted this commandment as love god and then do what you will
explaining this sentiment kreeft states that all sin serves some other god obeys another commander the world or the flesh or the devil if god truly be loved then one will do what god wills
the catechism associates this commandment with the three theological virtues
the first virtue faith instructs catholics to believe in god and avoid heresy apostasy and schism
the second virtue hope cautions catholics against despair and presumption
according to the catechism the last virtue charity can be met only if catholics refrain from indifference or ingratitude toward god and avoid spiritual laziness and a hatred of god stemming from pride
the catechism enumerates specific violations of this commandment including superstition polytheism sacrilege atheism and all practices of magic and sorcery
it further prohibits astrology palm reading and consulting horoscopes or mediums
the catechism attributes the latter actions to a desire for power over time history and in the last analysis other human beings as well as a wish to conciliate hidden powers
in the church 's opinion the honor paid to sacred images is a respectful veneration not the adoration due to god alone
in the <num> century heated arguments arose over whether religious icons in this context paintings were prohibited by the first commandment
the dispute was almost entirely restricted to the eastern church the iconoclasts wished to prohibit icons while the iconodules supported their veneration a position consistently backed by the western church
at the second council of nicaea in <num> the ecumenical council determined that the veneration of icons and statues was not in violation of the commandment and stated whoever venerates an image venerates the person portrayed in it
at around the time of the controversy over iconoclasm the western church began to use monumental sculpture which by the romanesque period became a major feature of western christian art that has remained part of the catholic tradition in contrast to eastern christianity which avoids large religious sculpture
the catechism using very traditional arguments posits that god gave permission for images that symbolize christian salvation by leaving symbols such as the bronze serpent and the cherubim on the ark of the covenant
it states that by becoming incarnate the son of god introduced a new economy of images
the united states conference of catholic bishops usccb explain the catechism in their book entitled united states catechism for adults published in <year>
regarding graven images they expound that this command addresses idolatry that in ancient times expressed itself in the worship of such things as the sun moon stars trees bulls eagles and serpents as well as emperors and kings
they explain that today idolatry expresses itself in the worship of other things and list some as power money materialism and sports
many ancient cultures believed that names were sacred some had prohibitions on when a person 's name could be spoken
the gospel of john relates an incident where a group of jews attempted to stone jesus after he used a sacred name of god to refer to himself
they interpreted his statement as a claim of divinity
since they did not believe that he was god they considered this blasphemy which under mosaic law carries a death penalty
kreeft writes that all of the names by which god is known are holy and thus all of those names are protected by the second commandment
the catechism states respect for his name is an expression of the respect owed to the mystery of god himself and to the whole sacred reality it evokes
the catechism also requires respect for the names of people out of respect for the dignity of that person
the sentiment behind this commandment is further codified in the lord 's prayer which begins our father who art in heaven hallowed be thy name
according to pope benedict xvi when god revealed his name to moses he established a relationship with mankind benedict states that the incarnation was the culmination of a process that had begun with the giving of the divine name
benedict elaborates that this means the divine name could be misused and that jesus inclusion of hallowed be thy name is a plea for the sanctification of god 's name to protect the wonderful mystery of his accessibility to us and constantly assert his true identity as opposed to our distortion of it
according to catholic teaching this commandment does not preclude the use of god 's name in taking solemn oaths administered by legitimate authority
however lying under oath invoking god 's name for magical purposes or voicing words of hatred or defiance against god are considered sins of blasphemy
it also constituted the core of the social order
although a few christian denominations follow the judaic practice of observing the sabbath on saturday catholics along with most christians observe sunday as a special day which they call the lord 's day
this practice dates to the first century arising from their belief that jesus rose from the dead on the first day of the week
the didache calls on christians to come together on the lord 's day to break bread and give thanks
tertullian is the first to mention sunday rest we however just as tradition has taught us on the day of the lord 's resurrection ought to guard not only against kneeling but every posture and office of solicitude deferring even our businesses lest we give any place to the devil de orat

in the sixth century caesarius of arles taught that the whole glory of the jewish sabbath had been transferred to sunday and that christians must keep sunday in the same way as the jews were commanded to keep the sabbath
the council of orléans in <num> reprobated this tendency to apply the law of the jewish sabbath to the observance of the christian sunday as jewish and non @-@ christian
the church leaders of later centuries inscribed sunday rest into official church teaching and christian governments have attempted to enforce the sunday rest throughout history
for catholics jesus teaching that the sabbath was made for man not man for the sabbath means that good works when the needs of others demand it can be part of the day of rest
the catechism offers guidelines on how to observe the lord 's day which include attending mass on sundays and holy days of obligation
on these days catholics may not work or do activities that hinder the worship due to god but performance of the works of mercy and appropriate relaxation in a spirit of joy are permitted
according to the usccb this commandment has been concretized for catholics as one of the church precepts
the organization cites the papal encyclical dies domini because the faithful are obliged to attend mass unless there is a grave impediment pastors have the corresponding duty to offer everyone the real possibility of fulfilling the precept
yet more than a precept the observance should be seen as a need rising from the depths of christian life
it is crucially important that all the faithful should be convinced that they cannot live their faith or share fully in the life of the christian community unless they take part regularly in the sunday eucharistic assembly
it strengthens generational relationships makes explicit the connection between family order and societal stability and reveals that the family is both willed and protected by god
because parents unconditional love for their children mirrors god 's love and because they have a duty to pass the faith on to their children the catechism calls the family a domestic church a privileged community and the original cell of social life
the catechism says this commandment requires duties of children to parents that include respect toward parents that also flows to brothers and sisters
gratitude as expressed in a quote from sirach remember that through your parents you were born what can you give back to them that equals their gift to you obedience to parents for as long as the child lives at home when it is for his good or the good of the family except when obedience would require the child to do something morally wrong
support that requires grown children to offer material and moral support for their aging parents particularly at times of illness loneliness or distress
keeping this commandment according to the catechism also requires duties of parents to children which include moral education spiritual formation and evangelization of their children
respect for their children as children of god and human persons
proper discipline for children while being careful not to provoke them
avoiding pressure to choose a certain profession or spouse which does not preclude parents from giving judicious advice
being a good example to their children
acknowledging their own failings to their children to guide and correct them
pope benedict xvi stated that this dictum of jesus brought the fourth commandment to a new and higher level
by doing god 's will any person can become part of the universal family of jesus
thus the fourth commandment 's responsibilities extend to the greater society and requires respect for legitimate social authorities
the catechism specifies duties of citizens and nations which kreeft summarizes as obedience and honor to all who for our good have received authority in society from god
payment of taxes exercising the right to vote and defending one 's country
an obligation to be vigilant and critical which requires citizens to criticize that which harms human dignity and the community
a duty to disobey civil authorities and directives that are contrary to the moral order
to practice charity which is a necessity for any working family or society it is the greatest social commandment and requires people to love god and neighbor
to welcome the foreigner who is in need of security and livelihood that cannot be found in his own country
an obligation for rich nations to help poor nations especially in times of immediate need
an expectation for families to help other families
indeed killing may under limited circumstances be justified within catholicism
jesus expanded it to prohibit unjust anger hatred and vengeance and to require christians to love their enemies
the basis of all catholic teaching about the fifth commandment is the sanctity of life ethic which kreeft argues is philosophically opposed to the quality of life ethic a philosophy which he characterizes as introduced by a book entitled die freigabe der vernichtung des lebensunwerten lebens the permission to destroy life unworthy of life see life unworthy of life and which he asserts was the first to win public acceptance
by german doctors before world war ii — the basis and beginning of nazi medical practices
this interpretation is supported by modern medical journals that discuss the dilemma posed by these opposing philosophies to physicians who must make life or death decisions
some bioethicists characterize the use of the nazi analogy as inappropriate when applied to quality of life decisions arthur caplan called this rhetoric odiously wrong
the church is actively involved in the public debates over abortion capital punishment and euthanasia and encourages believers to support legislation and politicians it describes as pro @-@ life
no one can under any circumstance claim for himself the right directly to destroy an innocent human being
direct and intentional killing of an innocent human is considered a mortal sin
considered by the church to be of an even greater gravity is the murder of family members including infanticide fratricide parricide the murder of a spouse and procured abortion
the catechism states that the embryo must be treated from conception as a person
the latin original of as is tamquam meaning like or just as
although the church has not determined officially when human life actually begins it has taken the course of maintaining that human life is present from the moment of conception or fertilization respect for life at all stages even potential life is generally the context of church documents
abortion has been specifically and persistently condemned by the church since the first century
formal cooperation in abortion incurs the penalty of excommunication by the very commission of the offense lat
latae sententiae sentence already i
e
automatically passed
the catechism emphasizes that this penalty is not meant to restrict mercy but that it makes clear the gravity of the crime and the irreparable harm done to the child its parents and society
formal cooperation in abortion extends not just to the mother who freely submits but also to the doctor nurses and anyone who directly aids in the act
the church has ministries of reconciliation such as project rachel for those who sincerely repent of their sin of formal cooperation in abortion
official church teaching allows for medical procedures and treatments intended to protect or restore the mother 's health if she would be in mortal danger without them even when such procedures carry some risk of death to the fetus
examples include the removal of a fallopian tube in the case of an ectopic pregnancy removal of a pregnant cancerous uterus or an appendectomy
embryonic stem cell research is called an immoral means to a good end and morally unacceptable
citing the congregation for the doctrine of the faith 's instruction on respect for human life in its origin and on the dignity of procreation the us bishops quote no objective even though noble in itself such as a foreseeable advantage to science to other human beings or to society can in any way justify experimentation on living human embryos or fetuses whether viable or not either inside or outside the mother 's body
the bishops note that adult stem cell research using cells obtained with informed consent is a promising field of research that is morally acceptable
the ordinary care of those facing an imminent death may not morally be withheld according to the church
ordinary care refers to food water and pain relief and does not include extraordinary care which refers to the use of respirators or feeding tubes that are considered discretionary
allowing a terminally ill person to die using painkillers that may shorten their life or refusing extraordinary treatment to the terminally ill such as chemotherapy or radiation are considered morally acceptable and not a violation of the fifth commandment in accordance with the principle of double effect
when the church was first officially recognized as a public institution in <num> its attitude toward capital punishment became one of toleration but not outright acceptance
the death penalty had support from early catholic theologians though some of them such as saint ambrose encouraged members of the clergy not to pronounce or carry out capital punishment
saint augustine answered objections to capital punishment rooted in the first commandment in the city of god
thomas aquinas and duns scotus argued that civil authority to carry out capital punishment was supported by scripture
pope innocent iii required peter waldo and the waldensians to accept that secular power can without mortal sin exercise judgement of blood provided that it punishes with justice not out of hatred with prudence not precipitation as a prerequisite for reconciliation with the church
paul suris states that official church teachings have neither absolutely condemned nor promoted capital punishment but toleration of it has fluctuated throughout the ages
the inquisitions provide the most memorable instance of church support for capital punishment although some historians considered these more lenient than the secular courts of the period
the catechism of the catholic church states that the death penalty is permissible in cases of extreme gravity
it is allowed if the guilty party 's identity and responsibility have been fully determined and if the death penalty is the only way to defend others against the guilty party
however if there are other means available to defend people from the unjust aggressor these are preferred because they are considered to be more respectful of the dignity of the person and in keeping with the common good
because modern societies have effective means for preventing crime without execution the catechism declares the cases in which execution of the offender is an absolute necessity are very rare if practically nonexistent
pope john paul ii discussed and affirmed this in evangelium vitae published in <year>
the church also warns against the opposite behavior of excessive preoccupation with the health and welfare of the body that idolizes physical perfection fitness and success at sports
kidnapping terrorism and torture are forbidden as well as sterilizations amputations mutilations that are not for therapeutic medical reasons
according to the catechism societies have a moral obligation to strive to provide healthy living conditions for all people
church belief in the resurrection of the body led to a prohibition against cremation that was pastorally modified at the second vatican council in the <num> under limited circumstances but those conditions have been largely ignored even by the clergy
according to the catechism burial of the dead is a corporal work of mercy that must treat the body with respect and love e
g
scattering of cremated remains burial in an unmarked grave etc
are forbidden in the catholic church
organ donation after death and organ transplants under certain terms also autopsies for legal and scientific reasons are permitted
going further christ asks his disciples to love their enemies
the catechism asserts that it is legitimate to insist on respect for one 's own right to life
kreeft says self @-@ defense is legitimate for the same reason suicide is not because one 's own life is a gift from god a treasure we are responsible for preserving and defending
the catechism teaches that someone who defends his life is not guilty of murder even if he is forced to deal his aggressor a lethal blow
legitimate defense can be not only a right but a grave duty for one who is responsible for the lives of others
the defense of the common good requires that an unjust aggressor be rendered unable to cause harm
for this reason those who legitimately hold authority also have the right to use arms to repel aggressors against the civil community entrusted to their responsibility
the church requires all to pray and work to prevent unjust wars but allows for just wars if certain conditions are met the reasons for going to war are defensive
the damage inflicted by the aggressor
must be lasting grave and certain
it is a last resort taken only after all other means of putting an end to the grave damage have been ineffective
the ultimate aim is peace and there is a serious chance of success
no graver evils are produced that overshadow the evil to be eliminated
this forbids the use of arms to eliminate whole cities and areas with their inhabitants
respect and care is required for non @-@ combatants wounded soldiers and prisoners
soldiers are required to disobey commands to commit genocide and ones that violate universal principles
in the gospel of matthew jesus stated whoever causes one of these little ones who believe in me to sin it would be better for him to have a great millstone fastened round his neck and to be drowned in the depth of the sea
the church considers it a serious crime to cause another 's faith hope and love to be weakened especially if it is done to young people and the perpetrator is a person of authority such as a parent teacher or priest
the sexes are meant by divine design to be different and complementary each having equal dignity and made in the image of god
sexual acts are sacred within the context of the marital relationship that reflects a complete and lifelong mutual gift of a man and a woman
sexual sins thus violate not just the body but the person 's whole being
in his <year> book crossing the threshold of hope john paul ii reflected on this concept after all young people are always searching for the beauty in love
they want their love to be beautiful
if they give in to weakness following the models of behavior that can rightly be considered a scandal in the contemporary world and these are unfortunately widely diffused models in the depths of their hearts they still desire a beautiful and pure love
this is as true of boys as it is of girls
ultimately they know that only god can give them this love
as a result they are willing to follow christ without caring about the sacrifices this may entail
like orthodox judaism and islam the catholic church considers all sexual acts outside of marriage to be grave sins
the gravity of the sin excludes one from sacramental communion until repented of and forgiven in sacramental confession
the catechism describes chastity as a moral virtue
a gift from god a grace a fruit of spiritual effort
the church sees sex as more than a physical act it also affects body and soul so the church teaches that chastity is a virtue all people are called to acquire
it is defined as the inner unity of a person 's bodily and spiritual being that successfully integrates a person 's sexuality with his or her entire human nature
to acquire this virtue followers are encouraged to enter into the long and exacting work of self @-@ mastery that is helped by friendships god 's grace maturity and education that respects the moral and spiritual dimensions of human life
the catechism categorizes violations of the sixth commandment into two categories offenses against chastity and offenses against the dignity of marriage
kreeft says lust does not mean sexual pleasure as such nor the delight in it nor the desire for it in its right context
lust is the desire for sexual pleasure alone outside its intended purpose of procreation and the uniting of man and woman body and soul in mutual self @-@ donation
masturbation is considered sinful for the same reasons as lust but is a step above lust in that it involves a physical act instead of a mental one
fornication is the sexual union of an unmarried man and an unmarried woman
this is considered contrary to the dignity of persons and of human sexuality because it is not ordered to the good of spouses or the generation and education of children
pornography ranks higher because it is considered a perversion of the sexual act that is intended for distribution to third parties for viewing
prostitution is considered sinful for both the prostitute and the customer it reduces a person to an instrument of sexual pleasure violating human dignity and harming society
the gravity of the sinfulness is less for prostitutes who are forced into the act by destitution blackmail or social pressure
rape is an intrinsically evil act that can cause grave damage to the victim for life
incest or rape of children by parents or other adult relatives or those responsible for the education of the children entrusted to them is considered the most heinous of sexual sins
like heterosexual acts outside of marriage homosexual acts are considered sins
the church distinguishes between homosexual attractions which are not considered sinful and homosexual acts which are
the catechism states that they violate natural law cannot bring forth life and do not proceed from a genuine affective and sexual complementarity
under no circumstances can they be approved
the church teaches that a homosexual inclination is objectively disordered and can be a great trial for the person who the church teaches must be accepted with respect compassion and sensitivity
unjust discrimination in their regard should be avoided
homosexuals are according to the church called to chastity
they are instructed to practice the virtues of self @-@ mastery that teaches inner freedom using the support of friends prayer and grace found in the sacraments of the church
these tools are meant to help homosexuals gradually and resolutely approach christian perfection which is a state to which all christians are called
two lay movements represent opposing philosophies regarding homosexuality dignityusa seeks to change the church 's teachings to justify homosexual acts courage international is an organization of homosexuals who support each other in the sincere effort to live in chastity and in fidelity to christ and his church
the unitive aspect includes the transference of each partner 's being so that they are no longer two but one flesh
the sacrament of matrimony is viewed as god 's sealing the consent which binds the partners together
church teaching on the marital state requires spousal acceptance of each other 's failures and faults and the recognition that the call to holiness in marriage is one that requires a process of spiritual growth and conversion that can last throughout life
sexual acts in marriage are considered noble and honorable and are meant to be enjoyed with joy and gratitude
sexuality is to be reserved to marriage by its very nature conjugal love requires the inviolable fidelity of the spouses
this is the consequence of the gift of themselves which they make to each other
love seeks to be definitive it cannot be an arrangement until further notice
the intimate union of marriage as a mutual giving of two persons and the good of the children demand total fidelity from the spouses and require an unbreakable union between them
gaudium et spes
artificial birth control predates christianity the catholic church has condemned these methods throughout its history
in response to the church of england accepting the practice of artificial contraception in <year> the catholic church issued the papal encyclical casti connubii on <num> december <year>
the <year> papal encyclical humanae vitae is a reaffirmation of the catholic church 's traditional view of marriage and marital relations and a continued condemnation of artificial birth control
the church seeing large families as a sign of god 's blessing
by its very nature the institution of marriage and married love is ordered to the procreation and education of the offspring and it is in them that it finds its crowning glory
gaudium et spes children are the supreme gift of marriage and contribute greatly to the good of the parents themselves

true married love and the whole structure of family life which results from it without diminishment of the other ends of marriage are directed to disposing the spouses to cooperate valiantly with the love of the creator and savior who through them will increase and enrich his family from day to day
gaudium et spes
it recognizes that responsible parenthood sometimes calls for reasonable spacing or limiting of births and considers natural family planning as morally acceptable but rejects all methods of artificial contraception
the church rejects all forms of artificial insemination and fertilization because the techniques divorce the sexual act from the creation of a child
the catechism states a child is not something owed to one but is a gift
the supreme gift of marriage
many western catholics and non @-@ catholics have voiced disagreement on the church 's support for natural family planning and contend it contributes to overpopulation and poverty
the church 's rejection of condom use is widely criticized in particular with regard to countries where the incidence of aids and hiv has reached epidemic proportions
in its defense catholics cite countries such as kenya and uganda where behavioral changes are encouraged instead of condom use and where greater progress in controlling the disease has been made than in countries that promote condom use alone
it is for this reason that the church considers it a greater sin than fornication
kreeft states the adulterer sins against his spouse his society and his children as well as his own body and soul
divorce according to the catholic new american bible translation jesus taught whoever divorces his wife unless the marriage is unlawful causes her to commit adultery and whoever marries a divorced woman commits adultery
explaining church interpretation of this teaching kreeft says jesus considered divorce to be an accommodation that had slipped into jewish law
the church teaches that marriage was created by god and was meant to be indissoluble like the creation of a child that cannot be un @-@ created neither can the one flesh of the marriage bond
the catechism states divorce is a grave offense against the natural law
it claims to break the contract to which the spouses freely consented to live with each other till death
by marrying another the divorced person adds to the gravity of the offense as the remarried spouse is considered to be in a state of public and permanent adultery
the compendium of the catechism <num> lists other offenses against the dignity of marriage polygamy incest free unions cohabitation concubinage and sexual acts before or outside of marriage
this is not considered a divorce and may be justified
civil divorce is not a divorce according to the church
if it is deemed to be the only way of ensuring legal rights care of children or protection of inheritance the church considers it morally acceptable
annulment is not a divorce it is a ruling by the church that the marriage was never valid
the marriage is deemed invalid if it lacks one of five integral elements it should be complete lifelong mutual a free gift and of man and woman
according to pope john paul ii 's address to the roman rota on <num> january <year> couples do not have a right to an annulment but do have a right to make their case for nullity or validity before the competent church authority and to request a decision in the matter
according to the catholic diocese of arlington
signs that might indicate reasons to investigate for an annulment are marriage that excluded at the time of the wedding the right to children or to a permanent marriage or to an exclusive commitment
in addition there are youthful marriages marriages of very short duration marriages marked by serious emotional physical or substance abuse deviant sexual practices profound and consistent irresponsibility and lack of commitment conditional consent to a marriage fraud or deceit to elicit spousal consent serious mental illness or a previous bond of marriage
the determination of the ground should be made after extensive consultation with the parish priest or deacons and based upon the proofs that are available
it places requirements upon those who possess worldly goods to use them responsibly taking into consideration the good of society
the catechism addresses the concept of human stewardship of god 's creation in its explanation of the seventh commandment and forbids abuse of animals and the environment
however ownership makes that person a steward who is expected to make it fruitful or profitable in a way that benefits others after that person has first taken care of their family
private property and the common good are seen as complementary elements that exist for the purpose of strengthening society
the taking of another 's private property in obvious and urgent necessity as the only way to provide for immediate essential needs food shelter clothing is not considered by the church to be stealing
the concept of slavery as private property is condemned by the church which classifies it as the stealing of a person 's human rights
unjustly taking and keeping the property of others considered as theft even if the act is outside the scope of civil law
cardinal christoph schönborn gave example from the story of saint augustine written in his confessions who took pears from neighbor 's garden when he was young
schönborn says that augustine still has pangs of conscience over a childish theft even when he became grown person indicating that human conscience is very aware of theft though the act perhaps not an offense against civil law
following acts are also considered as violation of the seventh commandment price manipulation to get advantage on the harm of others corruption appropriation of the public goods for personal interests work poorly carried out tax avoidance counterfeiting of checks or any means of payment any forms of copyright infringement and piracy and extravagance
of primary concern was the need for some amelioration for the misery and wretchedness pressing so unjustly on the majority of the working class
the encyclical supported the right to form unions rejected socialism communism and unrestricted capitalism and affirmed the right to private property
church interpretation of the seventh commandment teaches that business owners should balance a desire for profits that will ensure the future of the business with a responsibility toward the good of persons
business owners are required to pay their workers a reasonable wage honor contracts and abstain from dishonest activity including bribery of government officials
workers are required to do their jobs conscientiously as they have been hired to do them and to avoid dishonesty in the workplace such as using office goods for personal use without permission embezzlement
the church teaches that a balance should exist between government regulation and the laws of the marketplace
it deems that sole reliance on the marketplace pure capitalism insufficiently addresses many human needs while sole reliance on government regulation pure socialism perverts the basis of social bonds
the church warns about the danger of either capitalism or socialism as these systems tend to use excessive extremes that result in injustice to persons
wealthier nations like wealthier individuals have a moral obligation to help poorer nations and individuals and work to reform financial institutions and economic factors to benefit all
these violations have degrees of gravity depending on the intentions of the one who lies and the harms suffered by its victims
listed as follows these are false witness and perjury statements made publicly in court which obstruct justice by condemning the innocent or exonerating the guilty or which may increase the punishment of the accused
rash judgement believing without sufficient evidence that a person has done moral faults
detraction the disclosure of another 's faults without a valid reason
calumny lying to harm a person 's reputation and providing opportunity to others to make false judgements concerning them
flattery speech to deceive others for our benefit
bragging boasting or mocking speech which either only honors oneself or dishonors others
the church requires those who have damaged the reputation of another to make reparation for the untruth they have communicated
however it does not require a person to reveal a truth to someone who does not have a right to know and teaches respect for a right to privacy
priests are prohibited from violating the seal of confession no matter how grave the sin or its impact on society
included in the church teachings of this commandment is the requirement for christians to bear witness to their faith without equivocation in situations that require it
the use of modern media in spreading untruths by individuals businesses or governments is condemned
the catechism distinguishes between covetousness of the flesh improper sexual desire and covetousness for another 's worldly goods
the ninth commandment deals with the former and the tenth the latter
jesus emphasized the need for pure thoughts as well as actions and stated everyone who looks at a woman lustfully has already committed adultery with her in his heart matthew <num> <num>
the catechism states that with the help of god 's grace men and women are required to overcome lust and bodily desires for sinful relationships with another person 's spouse
in theology of the body a series of lectures given by pope john paul ii jesus statement in matthew <num> <num> is interpreted that one can commit adultery in the heart not only with another 's spouse but also with his her own spouse if one looks at him her lustfully or treats him her only as an object to satisfy instinct
purity of heart is suggested as the necessary quality needed to accomplish this task common catholic prayers and hymns include a request for this virtue
the church identifies gifts of god that help a person maintain purity chastity which enables people to love others with upright and undivided hearts
purity of intention which seeks to fulfill god 's will in everything knowing that it alone will lead to the true end of man
purity of vision external and internal disciplining the thoughts and imagination to reject those that are impure
prayer that recognizes the power of god to grant a person the ability to overcome sexual desires
modesty of the feelings as well as the body is discreet in choice of words and clothing
jesus stated blessed are the clean of heart for they shall see god
this purity of heart which the ninth commandment introduces is the precondition of the vision of god and allows the person to see situations and people as god sees
the catechism teaches that there is a connection between purity of heart of body and of faith
covetousness is prohibited by the tenth commandment because it is considered to be the first step toward commission of theft robbery and fraud these lead to violence and injustice
the church defines covetousness as a disordered desire that can take different forms greed is the desire for too much of what one does not need
envy is the desire for what belongs to another
the us bishops define it as an attitude that fills us with sadness at the sight of another 's prosperity
explaining church teaching of this commandment kreeft cites saint thomas aquinas who wrote an evil desire can only be overcome by a stronger good desire
the us bishops suggest that this can be achieved through cultivation of goodwill humility and gratitude for one 's own and others blessings while trusting in god 's grace
kreeft explains that saint paul the apostle illustrated the concept in his letter to the philippians when he listed his worldly credentials as a respected jew and stated i count everything as loss because of the surpassing worth of knowing christ jesus my lord
as jesus stated what shall it profit a man if he shall gain the whole world and lose his own soul church teaching on the tenth commandment is directed toward this same attitude toward worldly goods termed poverty of spirit
launched in <year> the ns @-@ <num> started life as a bookshelf speaker destined for the domestic environment
it was poorly received but eventually became a valuable tool with which to mix rock recordings
the speaker has a characteristic white @-@ coloured mid – bass drive unit
technically it is known as a speaker that easily reveals poor quality in recordings
recording engineers sought to dull its treble response by hanging tissue paper in front of it resulting in what became known as the tissue paper effect a type of comb filtering
the ns @-@ <num> has been used to monitor a large number of successful recordings by numerous artists leading gizmodo to refer to it as the most important loudspeaker you never heard of
yamaha discontinued the product in <year>
it was sold at the <num> price point
the speaker was poorly received and its commercial life was short
however it took five years for its popularity to be established with professional users
as recording engineers came to rely on the ns @-@ <num> as a benchmark it dominated the mixing of pop and rock music throughout the world for at least <num> years
the ns @-@ <num> displaced the auratone 5c sound cube as the nearfield monitor of choice in the <num> and was recognised for its ability to reveal shortcomings in recordings
it probably first reached american shores through a recording engineer 's visit to japan
the engineer likely to have been greg ladanyi monitored a recording session through the speaker in a japanese studio and brought a pair back on his return to the us
ladanyi then began using the speakers in a los angeles studio
other engineers heard the ns @-@ <num> for the first time and were impressed by its sound
its use spread to new york where the ns @-@ <num> was adopted at the power station and other studios
early use of the ns @-@ <num> among engineers include bob clearmountain rhett davies and bill scheniman in the us and nigel jopson in the uk
clearmountain then a rising star in record production is often credited for the popularity of the ns @-@ <num> phil ward writing in sound on sound suggested that clearmountain was probably not the earliest but was certainly the most influential early adopter
it became a legend that clearmountain had chosen it because it was the worst speaker he could find
he was one of a new breed of creative freelance recording engineers and producers who would travel from studio to studio equipped with their own gear that included microphones and a pair of yamaha ns @-@ <num> as a reference
recording studios around the world particularly those specialising in rock and pop music adopted the speaker as the standard
in excess of <num> @,@ <num> pairs were sold throughout the world
gizmodo referred to it as the most important loudspeaker you never heard of

the domestic version of the speaker was vertically orientated and came factory fitted with a grille
its two drivers are a <num> mm paper woofer and a <num> mm soft @-@ domed tweeter
the woofer 's diaphragm weighing <num>

the network is second @-@ order passive crossing over at <num> khz
the frequency range is quoted from <num> hz to <num> khz and rated power handling is <num> – <num> w
the early version of the speaker has press @-@ down type output terminals later models had screw terminals
whilst it can reveal any shortcomings in the recording mix as well as the monitoring chain it may lead to listener fatigue with prolonged use in the domestic setting
the ns @-@ <num> does not have a perfectly flat frequency response
the sound of the ns @-@ <num> is slightly heavy in the midrange and like other sealed @-@ box speakers of similar size its bass extension is limited
it has a <num> db boost in the midrange at around <num> khz and the bottom end starts rolling off at <num> hz
the midrange response is so open that it exposes the frequencies that are the most problematic and worst @-@ sounding to the human ear
on a practical level for the music professional the speaker is analytic and clinical @-@ sounding
gizmodo likened the ns @-@ <num> to music editors who reveal the weaknesses of recordings so that engineers would be forced to either make necessary compensation in the mix or otherwise rework them
a <year> report by newell et al
at southampton university undertaken for studio sound in <year> found that the ns @-@ <num> had excellent time @-@ domain response at low frequencies – its ability to start and stop in response to signal input was found to be superior to that of most other nearfield monitors
part of this was related to its closed @-@ box design
the researchers held that the extremely fast decay time of the speaker in the low frequencies ensures that the bass instruments guitar and drums are correctly balanced in the mix
technically identical to the studio the pro comes fitted with a speaker grille and is meant to be used in a vertical orientation
the professional version launched some nine years after its first introduction on the back of the popularity of the ns @-@ <num> among engineers
the revised version with everything including the logo and connection panel orientated horizontally was badged ns @-@ <num> studio

a miniature version named natural sound surround speaker ns10mm was launched in <year> or <year>
many professionals find it indispensable even though they may not particularly enjoy listening to it others refuse to give it space in their studio but will happily admit that it is an effective professional tool
the reliance on the ns @-@ <num> by top independent producers became a viral phenomenon thousands of studios equipped themselves with ns @-@ <num> to attract big named producers making the speakers an industry standard
covering the tweeters with tissue paper was said to produce treble @-@ deficient mixes when replayed on normal domestic hi @-@ fi
the phenomenon became the subject of hot debate
recording engineer bob hodas investigated the alleged sonic effects of tissue paper
he found inconsistent results with different paper but said that tissue paper generally demonstrated an undesirable effect known as comb filtering where the high frequencies are reflected back into the tweeter instead of being absorbed
hodas derided the tissue practice as aberrant behaviour saying that engineers usually fear comb filtering and its associated cancellation effects
he also suggested that more controllable and less random electronic filtering would be preferable
newell et al
noted that had the speakers grilles been used in studios where they are routinely removed they would have had the same effect on the treble output as the improvised tissue paper filter

the hemmema was initially developed for use against the russian navy in the archipelago sea and along the coasts of svealand and finland
it was designed by the prolific and innovative swedish naval architect fredrik henrik af chapman <year> – <year> in collaboration with augustin ehrensvärd <year> – <year> an artillery officer and later commander of the swedish archipelago fleet
the hemmema was a specialized vessel for use in the shallow waters and narrow passages that surround the thousands of islands and islets extending from the swedish capital of stockholm into the gulf of finland
the hemmema replaced the galleys that had made up the core of the swedish archipelago fleets until the mid @-@ <num> century
compared to galleys the hemmema had a deeper draft and was slower under oars but offered superior accommodation for the crew carried more stores was more seaworthy and had roughly ten times as many heavy guns
it could be propelled by either sails or oars but was still smaller and more maneuverable than most sailing warships which made it suitable for operations in confined waters
between <year> and <year> sweden built six hemmemas
the hemmema became the largest and most heavily armed vessel in the archipelago fleet and served in the russo @-@ swedish war of <year> – <num>
oden the first hemmema was relatively small and very similar to a turuma a different type of archipelago frigate
russia built six hemmemas based on the swedish design between <year> and <year> after capturing three of the swedish vessels at the surrender of sveaborg in <year>
the later versions both swedish and russian were much larger and much more heavily armed than oden
russian naval power in the baltic grew to challenge the interests of sweden the other leading power in the baltic
swedish holdings at that time included territory in northern germany all of modern finland and most of the baltic states a dominion depending on and connected by the baltic sea trade routes
during the great northern war <year> – <year> sweden lost all its territories in the baltic states and suffered russian raids in finland and along the chain of islands and archipelagos stretching from the gulf of finland to stockholm
the swedes began to deploy inshore flotillas of shallow @-@ draft vessels beginning with smaller versions of the traditional mediterranean galleys
most of these new vessels were more akin to galiots and were complemented with gun prams
the disastrous war with russia <year> – <num> and the minor involvement against prussia in the seven years war <year> – <num> showed the need for further expansion and development of the inshore flotillas with more specialized vessels
galleys were effective as troop transports for amphibious operations but were severely under @-@ gunned especially in relation to their large crews a galley with a <num> @-@ man crew most of whom were rowers would typically carry only one <num> @-@ pounder cannon and two <num> @-@ pounders all in the bow
the galleys also lacked decks and adequate shelter for the rower @-@ soldiers many of whom succumbed to illness as a result of exposure during the war of <year> – <num>
in <year> the commission concluded that the fortifications in southeastern finland needed to be improved and expanded and that sweden needed to build a strong coastal navy
augustin ehrensvärd <year> – <num> an artillery officer was the driving force behind these changes
the committee based many of its conclusions and decisions on his ideas
in <year> sweden established the archipelago fleet with the official name arméns flotta fleet of the army under the command of the army department krigskollegium with ehrensvärd as supreme commander
for two decades the struggle for power between the hats and the caps the dominant political factions at the time and rivalries between army and navy brought about changes to the archipelago fleet
the parliamentary victory of the hats in the riksdag in <year> – <num> and the coup d 'ètat by king gustav iii in <year> secured the archipelago fleet 's status as an independent branch of the army
starting in <year> the archipelago fleet merged with the finnish squadron finska eskadern based at sveaborg
in <year> it incorporated the swedish squadron svenska eskadern the galley fleet based at stockholm
the swedish armed forces invested considerable resources in the new army branch and made it a professional independent organization
the archipelago fleet attracted members of the social and cultural elite who enjoyed the protection and patronage of king gustav iii who had established himself as an absolute monarch in the <year> coup
after the poor performance of galleys in russo – swedish war of <year> – <num> and the pomeranian war <year> – <num> development of replacements became prioritized
during the pomeranian war trials had been made with gun prams skottpråmar heavily armed oar @-@ driven flat @-@ bottomed barges with a shallow draft that carried guns in broadside arrangements
the prams carried more guns than the galleys but proved far too slow to be effective
augustin ehrensvärd argued for new archipelago vessels that combined firepower maneuverability seaworthiness and decent crew accommodations
he began a successful collaboration with shipwright fredrik henrik chapman ennobled af chapman in <year> and together they developed five new vessels a gunboat with a <num> @-@ pounder gun and a schooner rigging as well as four types of archipelago frigates skärgårdsfregatter the smaller udema and pojama and the larger turuma and hemmema
all four types have been called skärgårdsfregatter archipelago frigates in swedish and english historical literature though some authors have called the udema and pojama archipelago corvettes
chapman specifically designed the archipelago frigates for service off the south coast of finland and named them after the finnish provinces of uusimaa pohjanmaa österbotten turunmaa åboland and hämeenmaa tavastia
the english tudor navy had used small galleasses in the mid @-@ <num> century
in the <num> its successor the royal navy equipped the equivalent of sixth @-@ rates with oar ports on or below the gundeck
during the <num> century the russian navy introduced shebecks baltic variants on the mediterranean xebecs for inshore duties
the xebecs were good sailers could be rowed if necessary and had more guns and greater stores than galleys they were also less expensive to maintain
the russian designs influenced chapman and the swedish naval commanders
consequently chapman 's designs for new ships were elaborations on those principles but with adaptations to archipelago warfare
chapman 's archipelago frigates provided better protection for their crew than the galleys they replaced and up to three times the capacity for stores and provisions
they could operate in the narrow shallow waters around skerries in all weathers and in open water in all but the worst storms
they had a deeper draft than galleys but considerably shallower draft than traditional sailing warships
the new ship types also increased the archipelago fleet 's firepower provided it with better defensive capabilities and made possible more efficient fire support in amphibious operations
the first hemmema the oden was completed in <year>
it was c
<num> m <num>
<num> ft long and <num>
<num> m <num>
<num> ft wide with a draft of <num>
<num> m <num>
<num> ft
it had a low hull with no forecastle only a low quarterdeck and no poop deck
it had three masts that were initially rigged with lateen sails like a galley
the navy later replaced the lateen rigs with a more conventional square @-@ sail frigate rig
the early design provided for <num> pairs of oars with four men per oar
the rowers plied their oars from the gun deck through oar ports positioned between the gunports close to the waterline which gave the rowers better leverage
the oars were also placed on a rectangular outrigger designed to further improve the leverage
even so hemmemas performed poorly when rowed and were difficult in contrary winds
they were slower than ordinary sailing ships but sailed better than galleys
during the russian war of <year> – <year> sweden built three hemmemas of a new design
they were considerably larger <num>
<num> by <num> m <num> by <num> ft and the number of oars were increased to <num> pairs
they also had some of the heaviest broadsides even when compared with the much larger frigates of the high seas navy
the artillery officer carl fredrik aschling had cooperated with chapman to increase the main armament to twenty @-@ two <num> @-@ pounders and two <num> @-@ pounders which increased the draft by about <num> cm <num> ft
the addition of diagonal bracers to reinforce the hull allowed the later hemmemas to carry guns more powerful even than those on the largest sailing frigates of the high seas navy
due to their considerable firepower and relative size naval historian jan glete has described the hemmemas as super archipelago frigates
the hemmema 's design was very similar to that of the turuma
the primary difference was that the turuma 's oarsmen sat on the weather deck above the guns whereas the hemmema 's oarsmen sat on the gundeck
the later hemmemas were considerably larger more heavily armed and of a more robust construction
glete has described them as variations on the same type especially when considering the pre @-@ war designs
they supported amphibious operations and conducted raids on the russian archipelago fleet while at the same time acting as sea @-@ borne flank support for the swedish army on the finnish mainland
hemmemas fought in the first and second battles of svensksund
during the first battle in <year> one hemmema complemented the similar turumas and in the second battle in july <year> two hemmemas made up the defensive center and provided a considerable percentage of the firepower
the swedes were building three additional hemmemas at the shipyards within the fortress of sveaborg when it was surrendered to the russians in <year> and all three were incorporated in the russian navy
shortly afterward the russian navy built its own <num> @-@ gun versions with the final vessel launched as late as <year>
two more were built in sweden in <year> birger jarl and erik segersäll
birger jarl sank in an accident in <year> and erik segersäll was planned for conversion as a paddlewheel steam battery for coastal defense though the idea was eventually abandoned and the ship scrapped in <year>
like the other specialized archipelago vessels the hemmema had specific strengths and weaknesses
although it had superior firepower relative to galleys its sailing qualities were somewhat mediocre and while highly manoeuvrable under oars it was still difficult to propel while rowed
a hemmema had the potential to be an effective weapon against galleys matching their forward firepower and severely outgunning them with its broadside armament
inside an enemy galley formation it could wreak considerable havoc but such a maneuver was never achieved in an actual battle leaving that tactical role untested
details of individual vessels are listed below
the swedish hemmemas were all built to the same specifications except for the early design oden and birger jarl and erik segersäll carried heavier armament than the others
tredrea and sozaev list oden as a turuma rebuilt as a hemmema in <year> though oscar nikula and lars @-@ otto berg do not
the russian vessels were built between <year> and <year> and have been described by tredea and sozaev as bodryi @-@ class rowing frigates
under the finnish form hämeenmaa the name of the ship type was later carried on to several vessels of the <num> century finnish navy
after the war he became a professor of physics at the carnegie institute of technology
he was vice president of research at general atomics from <year> to <year>
he published over <num> papers on botany physics mathematics metallurgy and science policy and held <num> patents relating to nuclear energy
a graduate of the university of wisconsin – madison creutz helped princeton university build its first cyclotron
during world war ii he worked on nuclear reactor design under eugene wigner at the metallurgical laboratory designing the cooling system for the first water @-@ cooled reactors
he led a group that studied the metallurgy of uranium and other elements used in reactor designs
in october <year> he moved to the los alamos laboratory where he became a group leader
after the war ended creutz accepted an offer to come to the carnegie institute of technology where he became the head of its physics department and its nuclear research center in <year>
in <year> he returned to los alamos to evaluate its thermonuclear fusion program for the atomic energy commission
while there he accepted an offer to become vice president for research and development and the director of its john jay hopkins laboratory for pure and applied science at general atomics
under his leadership general atomics developed triga a nuclear reactor for universities and laboratories
creutz served as an assistant director of the national science foundation from <year> to <year> and then as director of the bernice pauahi bishop museum in honolulu where he took particular interest in the museum 's preparation of a manual of the flowering plants of hawaii
he had two older brothers john and jim and a younger sister edith
the family moved to eau claire wisconsin in <year> monroe wisconsin in <year> and to janesville wisconsin in <year>
he played a number of musical instruments including the mandolin ukulele and trombone
he played in the school bands at janesville high school and monroe high school
at janesville he played tenor banjo in a dance orchestra called rosie 's ragadors and timpani with the school orchestra at monroe
he also played left guard on the american football teams at janesville and monroe
he expressed an interest in chemistry biology geology and photography
after graduating from janesville high school in <year> he took a job as a bookkeeper at a local bank
in <year> his brother john who had graduated from the university of wisconsin – madison with a degree in electrical engineering persuaded him to go to college as well
john suggested that if you aren ’ t sure what part of science you want take physics because that 's basic to all of them
creutz later recalled that this was the best advice he ever got
he entered the university of wisconsin and studied mathematics and physics
money was scarce during the great depression especially after his father died in <year>
to pay his bills creutz worked as a dishwasher and short order cook and took a job taking care of the physics laboratory equipment
in <year> his senior year he taught physics laboratory classes
creutz encountered several members of the faculty at the university of wisconsin including julian mack ragnar rollefson raymond herb eugene wigner and gregory breit
mack gave creutz a research project to do in his junior year
creutz remained at wisconsin as a graduate student after receiving his bachelor of science b
s
degree in <year> working for herb upgrading the departmental van de graaff generator from <num> to <num> kev
with this done the question became what to do with it and breit suggested that it had previously been observed that high @-@ energy gamma rays were produced when lithium was bombarded with protons at <num> kev
creutz therefore wrote his <year> doctor of philosophy ph
d
thesis on resonance scattering of protons by lithium under breit 's supervision
creutz married lela rollefson a mathematics student at wisconsin and the sister of ragnar rollefson on september <num> <year>
the couple had three children two sons michael and carl and a daughter ann jo
wigner moved to princeton university in <year> and soon after creutz received an offer as well
princeton had been given a <num> @-@ inch <num> mm magnet by the university of california which had been used to build an <num> mev cyclotron
they wanted creutz to help get it operational
he later recalled on my third day in princeton i was invited to give a short report on my thesis work
there were usually two or three speakers at these journal club meetings
this time the speakers were niels bohr albert einstein and ed creutz
to be on the same program with these two giants of scientific accomplishments was breathtaking
just before the meeting began my sponsor delsasso asked me say creutz have you met einstein yet i had not
delsasso took me over to where einstein was sitting in sweatshirt and tennis shoes and said professor einstein this is creutz who has come to work on our cyclotron
the great man held out his hand which seemed as big as a dinner plate and said in an accented voice i ’ m glad to meet you dr
creutz
i managed to wheeze out i ’ m glad to meet you too dr
einstein
but it was bohr who electrified the audience with his news from europe of the discovery by lise meitner and otto frisch of nuclear fission
physicists rushed to confirm the results
creutz built an ionization chamber and a linear amplifier out of radio vacuum tubes coffee cans and motorcycle batteries and with this apparatus the physicists at princeton were able to confirm the results
in early <year> arthur compton concentrated the manhattan project 's various teams working on plutonium and nuclear reactor design including wigner 's team from princeton at the metallurgical laboratory at the university of chicago
the name was a codename creutz was the first to conduct actual metallurgy research and he hired its first metallurgist to work with him
wigner led the theoretical group that included creutz leo ohlinger alvin m
weinberg katharine way and gale young
the group 's task was to design the reactors that would convert uranium into plutonium
at the time reactors existed only on paper and no reactor had yet gone critical
in july <year> wigner chose a conservative <num> mw design with a graphite neutron moderator and water cooling
the choice of water as a coolant was controversial at the time because water was known to absorb neutrons thereby reducing the efficiency of the reactor but wigner was confident that his group 's calculations were correct and that water would work while the technical difficulties involved in using helium or liquid metal as a coolant would delay the project
working seven days a week the group designed the reactors between september <year> and january <year>
creutz studied the corrosion of metals in a water @-@ cooled system and designed the cooling system
in <year> a patent for the reactor design would be issued in the name of creutz ohlinger weinberg wigner and young
as a group leader at the metallurgical laboratory creutz conducted studies of uranium and how it could be extruded into rods
his group looked into the process of corrosion in metals in contact with fast @-@ flowing liquids the processes for fabricating aluminium and jacketing uranium with it
it also investigated the forging of beryllium and the preparation of thorium
frederick seitz and alvin weinberg later reckoned that the activities of creutz and his group may have reduced the time taken to produce plutonium by up to two years
the discovery of spontaneous fission in reactor @-@ bred plutonium due to contamination by plutonium @-@ <num> led wigner to propose switching to breeding uranium @-@ <num> from thorium but the challenge was met by the los alamos laboratory developing an implosion @-@ type nuclear weapon design
in october <year> creutz moved to los alamos where he became a group leader responsible for explosive lens design verification and preliminary testing
difficulties encountered in testing the lenses led to the construction of a special test area in pajarito canyon and creutz became responsible for testing there
as part of the preparation for the trinity nuclear test creutz conducted a test detonation at pajarito canyon without nuclear material
this test brought bad news it seemed to indicate that the trinity test would fail
hans bethe worked through the night to assess the results and was able to report that the results were consistent with a perfect explosion
creutz in turn recruited a number of young physicists who had worked with him at princeton and on the manhattan project in chicago and los alamos including martyn foss jack fox roger sutton and sergio debenedetti
together with funding from the office of naval research they built a <num> mev synchrotron at the nuclear research center near saxonburg pennsylvania
for a time this put them at the forefront of research into nuclear physics allowing physicists there to study the recently discovered pi meson and mu meson
a visiting scholar gilberto bernardini created the first photographic emulsion of a meson
creutz became a professor the head of the physics department and the head of nuclear research center at the carnegie institute of technology in <year>
he was also a member of the executive board at the argonne national laboratory from <year> to <year> and a consultant at the oak ridge national laboratory from <year> to <year>
in addition to his work on nuclear physics he cultivated flowers and orchids at his home
he published eight papers on floral species and named three varieties of violets after his children
one <year> paper published in the new york botanical garden journal was on apetahia raiateensis a rare flower found only on the island of raiatea in french polynesia
he travelled to polynesia many times and translated grammar of the tahitian language from french into english
his family served as hosts for a time to two young people from tahiti and samoa
in <year> and <year> creutz spent a year at los alamos evaluating its thermonuclear fusion program for the atomic energy commission
while there he was approached by frederic de hoffmann who recruited him to join the general atomics division of general dynamics
he moved to la jolla california as its vice president for research and development and was concurrently the director of its john jay hopkins laboratory for pure and applied science from <year> to <year>
he was also a member of the advisory panel on general science at the department of defense from <year> to <year>
under his leadership general atomics developed triga a small reactor for universities and laboratories
triga used uranium zirconium hydride uzrh fuel which has a large prompt negative fuel temperature coefficient of reactivity
as the temperature of the core increases the reactivity rapidly decreases
it is thus highly unlikely though not completely impossible for a nuclear meltdown to occur
due to its safety and reliability which allows it to be installed in densely populated areas and its ability to still generate high energy for brief periods which is particularly useful for research it became the world 's most popular research reactor and general atomics sold <num> trigas in <num> countries
the high @-@ temperature gas @-@ cooled reactor htgr was less successful and only two htgr power reactors were built both in the united states
a <num> mw demonstration unit at the peach bottom nuclear generating station in pennsylvania operated successfully but a larger <num> mw unit at the fort st
vrain generating station in colorado encountered technical problems
general atomics also conducted research into thermonuclear energy including means of magnetically confining plasma
between <year> and <year> creutz published six papers on the subject
in <year> president richard nixon appointed creutz as assistant director for research of the national science foundation
he became assistant director for mathematical and physicals sciences in <year> and was acting deputy director from <year> to <year>
the <num> energy crisis raised the national profile of energy issues and creutz served on a panel that produced a study called the nation 's energy future
his wife lela died of cancer in <year>
in <year> he married elisabeth cordle who worked for the national science board
the two of them enjoyed locating and photographing rare orchids
his appointment at the national science foundation ended in <year> and creutz became director of the bernice pauahi bishop museum in honolulu
he took particular interest in the museum 's work preparing a two @-@ volume manual of the flowering plants of hawaii which was published in <year>
he expanded programs for education and outreach and secured funding for two new buildings
he retired in <year> and returned to his home in rancho santa fe california and died there on june <num> <year>

it received generally positive reviews from critics
shawna malcom of the los angeles times noted that she preferred the boys performance to the girls commenting their number had the same heart @-@ soaring power as don 't stop believin performed in the pilot episode
malcom enjoyed sue 's character development in the episode claiming that in less skilled hands there ’ s no doubt sue would be an over @-@ the @-@ top disaster
but thanks to the incomparable jane lynch i can ’ t wait to see what trouble the character stirs up next
aly semigran of mtv also enjoyed the boys performance more than the girls and gave the episode a mostly positive review writing that it moved the series storylines to a whole new level
she felt however that the episode didn 't have nearly enough singing
mandi bierly for entertainment weekly similarly noted that so much happened in this hour that the musical numbers though enjoyable were almost an afterthought
bierly favoured the girls performance and praised morrison 's acting commenting matthew morrison communicates so much with his eyes
there ’ s a softness and a longing in them that i ’ m always surprised emma jayma mays matches
mike hale for the new york times praised mays performance noting jayma mays registered emma ’ s devastation with just the slightest widening of those enormous eyes
in fact all the best non @-@ singing moments in the episode were hers
hale was less impressed with the rest of the episode deeming the pregnancy storyline so boring that is hardly mattered
he noted that for many viewers the best moments in the episode probably came very early on and involved jane lynch ’ s sue sylvester who still got all the best lines
jarett wieselman for the new york post agreed with this assessment opining that although the episode was filled with more brilliant moments than ever before the stand @-@ out scene was sue writing in her journal which wieselman deemed jam @-@ packed with so many one liners it acted as a vacuum sucking the smart out of everything else on tv from <num> <num> to <num> <num> pm
fellow new york post critic maxine shen deemed the episode her favorite of the series so far
anna pickard of the guardian called the pseudoephedrine storyline relentlessly silly
but joyfully so preferring the boys performance to the girls as some excellent comedy helped me forget about finn 's dodgy autotuned vocals for once

she soon became a private secretary to the president of the title guarantee and trust company
the bank which held many assets of the oregon common school fund failed during hobbs time there
ben olcott who was the secretary of state and a member of the state land board was charged with protecting the common school fund and was involved in negotiating with the failing bank over the state 's assets

lawson
copperfield located on the snake river in baker county had grown up around construction projects for a railroad tunnel and power plant
fifteen @-@ hundred jobs in the area came from the railway project of e

harriman or the power generation facility
the town had descended into lawlessness with a number of saloons brothels dancing halls and widespread gambling
the town had no law enforcement officers and the local government officials had become bar keepers
governor west had extended prohibition laws some local residents had appealed to the state government for assistance
but they were widely ignored in copperfield
over half the residents of the town had signed a petition addressed to west alleging that saloons owned by the mayor and city council members were selling liquor to minors and staying open later than their posted hours
governor west responded by ordering county officials to restore order close the saloons and force the resignations of the corrupt city leaders by december <num> <year>
county officials did not take care of the problem so west sent hobbs hoping the presence of a woman would prevent any outbreak of violence
hobbs was a petite woman standing <num> feet <num> inches <num>
<num> m tall and weighing less than <num> pounds <num> kg
she was dispatched with orders to restore order and to implement martial law if necessary
while hobbs was traveling to eastern oregon both she and governor west were coy with reporters about the presence of the militia men suggesting that hobbs might be acting alone
the saloon keepers who received word that hobbs was accompanied by law enforcement officers only shortly before her arrival greeted her by dressing up the town with bunting blue and pink ribbons and flowers
a town meeting was arranged at <num> <num> p

governor west requested a hearing seeking rand 's temporary removal from office and appointed hobbs to represent the state as special counsel
the actions of the governor were later challenged in court with hobbs and west among the defendants
the saloon keepers sought remuneration for liquor they claimed was confiscated during the period of martial law
the baker county circuit court determined the governor 's actions were within his powers and the oregon supreme court ultimately concurred
these events made hobbs the most famous woman in oregon at that time
hobbs also made national and international news for these events
she visited the union county town of cove in february <year> also to investigate complaints about a saloon

it was recorded on april <num> <year> at cbs studios in new york city with his band prime time which featured guitarists charlie ellerbee and bern nix bassist jamaaladeen tacuma and drummers calvin weston and coleman 's son denardo
it followed coleman 's failed attempt to record a direct @-@ to @-@ disc session earlier in march <year>
of human feelings explores jazz @-@ funk music and continues coleman 's harmolodic approach to improvisation with prime time whom he introduced on his <year> album dancing in your head
he drew on rhythm and blues influences from early in his career for of human feelings which had shorter and more distinct compositions than dancing in your head
coleman also applied free jazz principles from his music during the <num> to elements of funk
following a change in management coleman signed with island records and of human feelings was released in <year> by its subsidiary label antilles records
critics generally praised coleman 's expressive music and harmolodic approach but the album made little commercial impact and went out of print
coleman enlisted his son denardo as manager after a dispute with his former managers over the album 's royalties a change that inspired him to perform publicly again during the <num>
in the mid @-@ <num> he stopped recording free jazz recruited electric instrumentalists and pursued a new creative theory he called harmolodics
according to coleman 's theory all the musicians are able to play individual melodies in any key and still sound coherent as a group
he taught his young sidemen this new improvisational and ensemble approach based on their individual tendencies and prevented them from being influenced by conventional styles
coleman likened this group ethic to a spirit of collective consciousness that stresses human feelings and biological rhythms and said that he wanted the music rather than himself to be successful
he also started to incorporate elements from other styles into his music including rock influences such as the electric guitar and non @-@ western rhythms played by moroccan and nigerian musicians
of human feelings was a continuation of the harmolodics approach coleman had applied with prime time an electric quartet introduced on his <year> album dancing in your head
the group comprised guitarists charlie ellerbee and bern nix bassist jamaaladeen tacuma and drummers ronald shannon jackson and denardo coleman ornette coleman 's son
tacuma was still in high school when coleman enlisted him and first recorded with prime time in <year> for the album body meta which was released in <year>
tacuma had played in an ensemble for jazz organist charles earland but earland dismissed him as he felt audiences gave excessive attention to his playing
coleman found tacuma 's playing ideal for harmolodics and encouraged him not to change
although coleman 's theory initially challenged his knowledge and perception of music tacuma came to like the unconventional role each band member was given as a soloist and melodist when we read ornette 's music we have his notes but we listen for his phrases and phrase the way he wants to
i can take the same melody then and phrase it like i want to and those notes will determine the phrasing the rhythm the harmony – all of that
in march <year> coleman went to rca records new york studio to produce an album with prime time by direct @-@ to @-@ disc recording
they had mechanical problems with the studio equipment and the recording was rejected
the failed session was a project under phrase text coleman 's music publishing company
he wanted to set up his own record company with the same name and chose his old friend kunle mwanga as his manager
in april mwanga arranged another session at cbs studios in new york city and coleman recorded of human feelings there on april <num> the session was originally titled fashion faces
jackson did not record with the band and calvin weston was hired in his place to play simultaneously with denardo coleman
they recorded all the album 's songs on the first take without any equipment problems
the album was recorded with a sony pcm @-@ <year> two @-@ track digital recorder a rare item at the time
according to journalist howard mandel the passages played by the band sounded neither very soft or loud on the album because it had been mixed with a middle @-@ frequency range and compressed dynamics
because of the equipment used coleman did not embellish the album with added effects and avoided overdubbing multi @-@ tracking and remixing
according to him of human feelings was the first jazz album to be digitally recorded in the united states
lloyd sachs of the chicago sun @-@ times wrote that although coleman was not viewed as a jazz fusion artist the album can be described as such because of its combination of free jazz and funk
glenn kenny disagreed and felt its boisterous style had more in common with the no wave genre and the artists of new york city 's downtown music scene such as john zorn
jazz writer stuart nicholson viewed it as the culmination of coleman 's musical principles that dated back to his free jazz music in <year> but reappropriated with a funk @-@ oriented backbeat
according to jazz critic barry mcrae it was as if coleman was translating the concept of the famous double quartet from his <year> album free jazz to what was required to perform jazz @-@ funk
coleman incorporated traditional structures and rhythms and other elements from the rhythm and blues music he had played early his career
according to mandel the album 's simple brisk music was more comparable to a coherent r b band than jazz fusion
although coleman still performed the melodies on a song he employed two guitarists for contrast to make each pair of guitarist and drummer responsible for either the rhythm or melody
ellerbee provided accented linear counterpoint and nix played variations of the song 's melody while denardo coleman and weston played both polyrhythms and backbeats
tacuma and ornette coleman 's instrumental responses were played as the foreground to the less prominent guitars
mcrae remarked that coleman and prime time exchanged directional hints throughout the songs as one player changed key and the others modulated accordingly
the band made no attempt to harmonize their radically different parts
of human feelings features shorter and more distinct compositions than dancing in your head
sleep talk air ship and times square were originally performed by coleman during his concerts in <year> under the names dream talking meta and writing in the streets respectively
what is the name of that song was titled as a sly reference to two of his older compositions love eyes and forgotten songs also known as holiday for heroes whose themes were played concurrently and transfigured by prime time
the theme from forgotten songs originally from coleman 's <year> album skies of america was used as a refrain
on songs such as jump street and love words ellerbee incorporated distortion into his guitar playing which gave the songs a thicker texture
jump street is a blues piece air ship comprises a six @-@ bar riff and the atonal times square has futuristic dance themes
love words heavily uses polymodality a central feature of harmolodics and juxtaposes coleman 's extended solo against a dense rhythmically complex backdrop
nicholson observed west african rhythms and collective improvisation rooted in new orleans jazz on love words and suggested that sleep talk was derived from the opening bassoon solo in igor stravinsky 's <year> orchestral work the rite of spring
trio who had previously released a compilation of coleman 's <year> to <year> live performances in paris prepared to press the album once mwanga provided the label with the record stamper
coleman was also set to perform his song skies of america with the nhk symphony orchestra but cancelled both deals upon mwanga 's return from japan
mwanga immediately quit after less than four months as coleman 's manager
in <year> coleman hired stan and sid bernstein as his managers who sold the album 's recording tapes to island records
he signed with the record label that year and of human feelings was released in <year> on island 's subsidiary jazz label antilles records
billboard magazine published a front @-@ page story at the time about its distinction as both the first digital album recorded in new york city and the first digital jazz album recorded by an american label
according to jazz writer francis davis a modest commercial breakthrough seemed imminent for coleman who appeared to be regaining his celebrity
german musicologist peter niklas wilson said the album may have been the most tuneful and commercial @-@ sounding of his career at that point
the album 's clean mix and relatively short tracks were interpreted as an attempt for radio airplay by mandel who described its production as the surface consistency that would put it in the pop sphere
of human feelings had no success on the american pop charts only charting on the top jazz albums where it spent <num> weeks and peaked at number <num>
because the record offered a middle ground between funk and jazz mcrae argued that it consequently appealed to neither demographic of listeners
sound vision critic brent butterworth speculated that it was overlooked because it had electric instruments rock and funk drumming and did not conform to what he felt was the hokey image of jazz that many of the genre 's fans preferred
the album later went out of print
of human feelings received considerable acclaim from contemporary critics
in a review for esquire gary giddins hailed it as another landmark album from coleman and his most accomplished work of harmolodics partly because of compositions which he found clearly expressed and occasionally timeless
in his opinion the discordant keys radically transmuted conventional polyphony and would be the most challenging part for listeners whom he said should concentrate on coleman 's playing and let the maelstrom resolve itself around his center
kofi natambu from the detroit metro times said coleman 's synergetic approach displayed expressive immediacy rather than superficial technical flair while calling the record a multi @-@ tonal mosaic of great power humor color wit sensuality compassion and tenderness
he found the songs inspirational danceable and encompassing developments in african @-@ american music over the previous century
robert christgau found the music heartfelt and sophisticated in its exchange of rhythms and simple pieces of melody writing in the village voice the way the players break into ripples of song only to ebb back into the tideway is participatory democracy at its most practical and utopian
purist critics in jazz complained about the music 's incorporation of danceable beats and electric guitar
in stereo review chris albertson deemed the combination of saxophone and bizarre funk occasionally captivating but ultimately unfocused
dan sullivan of the los angeles times argued that the album 's supporters in hip rock circles had overlooked flaws he felt tacuma and coleman 's playing sounded like a unique beacon of clarity amid an incessant background
leonard feather wrote in the toledo blade deemed the music stylistically ambiguous potentially controversial and difficult to assess but interesting enough to warrant a listen
at the end of <year> billboard editor peter keepnews named of human feelings the year 's best album calling it a prime example of fusing free jazz with modern funk
in year @-@ end lists for the boston phoenix james hunter and howard hampton ranked the album number one and number four respectively
it was voted <num> best in the pazz jop an annual poll of american critics nationwide published in the village voice
christgau the poll 's supervisor ranked it number one in an accompanying list and in <year> he named it the second @-@ best album of the <num>
coleman received <num> @,@ <num> for the publishing rights to of human feelings but said his managers sold it for less than the recording costs and that he did not receive any of its royalties
according to stan bernstein coleman had financial expectations that were unrealistic in this business unless you 're michael jackson
antilles label executive ron goldstein felt the <num> @,@ <num> coleman received was neither a great nor a fair amount for someone in jazz
after he had gone over budget to record a follow @-@ up album island did not release it nor pick up their option on him and in <year> he left the bernstein agency
he chose denardo coleman to manage his career while overcoming his reticence of public performance which had been rooted in his distrust of doing business with a predominantly white music industry
according to nicholson the man once accused of standing on the throat of jazz was welcomed back to the touring circuits with both curiosity and affection during the <num>
coleman did not record another album for six years and instead performed internationally with prime time
in a <year> article for the new york times on coleman 's work with prime time robert palmer said of human feelings was still innovative and radical by the standards of other music in <year> three years after it was recorded
because writers and musicians had heard its test pressing in <year> the album 's mix of jazz improvisation and gritty punk and funk @-@ derived energy sounded prophetic when it was released palmer explained
the album is clearly the progenitor of much that has sounded radically new in the ongoing fusion of punk rock black dance rhythms and free jazz
allmusic critic scott yanow believed that although coleman 's compositions never achieved popularity they succeeded within the context of an album that showcased his distinctive saxophone style which was high @-@ brow yet catchy
joshua klein from the a
v
club recommended of human feelings as the best album for new listeners of coleman 's harmolodics @-@ based music while chicago tribune rock critic greg kot included it in his guide for novice jazz listeners he named it one of the few albums that helped him both become a better listener of rock music and learn how to enjoy jazz
in <year> new york magazine 's martin johnson included it in his list of canonical albums from what he felt had been new york 's sceneless yet vital jazz scene in the previous <num> years of human feelings exuded what he described as a spirit of sophistication with elements of funk latin and african music all of which were encapsulated by music that retained a jazz identity
although the tour was intended to showcase songs from her debut solo album dangerously in love <year> the set list also contained a special segment dedicated to beyoncé 's girl group destiny 's child and featured songs from her <year> film the fighting temptations
the stage was simple and featured a large led screen in the back that displayed video images of beyoncé and her dancers as well as some images from her music videos and some prerecorded images
the tour was reviewed negatively by dave simpson of the guardian who graded it with two stars out of five
the dangerously in love tour only reached europe and beyoncé 's performance at the wembley arena in london was filmed and later released on the cd dvd live at wembley <year>
the tour was intended to showcase songs from beyoncé debut solo album dangerously in love released in <year>

the stage was simple and featured a large led screen in the back that moved up and down throughout the entire show and displayed video images of beyoncé and her dancers as well as some images from her music videos and some prerecorded images with special effects
the show also featured a small staircase and platforms on both side of the stairs for her band
beyoncé later toured alongside missy elliott and alicia keys as ensemble for the verizon ladies first tour <year> in north america
like everything else – hits boots hair and sponsorship deals – moments are very big in beyoncé world
an age later cheers erupt for the raising of a curtain which revealed er a roadie fiddling with a drum kit
an hour later the piped music is getting gradually louder to drown boos and the cries of small children whose parents are moaning it 's getting past their bedtime
the show opens with baby boy which beyoncé sang while being lowered onto the stage upside down
a highlight for many fans was her performance of dangerously in love <num>
during the tour a special <num> @-@ minutes rendition of the song was performed
simpson of the guardian reviewed the opening show of the tour negatively grading it with two out of five stars
he was negative about beyoncé clothing during the show saying the delays may well be down to beyoncé 's wardrobe which could trouble imelda marcos
there are skimpy skirts tails for a note perfect if pointless version of peggy lee 's fever and a general theme of low material high glitz
but often the main sparkle is on beyoncé 's outfit
he also added that the dancers naked suits make the former church girl a raunchy rival to kylie minogue
but there 's an interminable section where they pretend to be homies and when beyoncé disappears for long periods it feels like an expensive night with legs and co
he concluded his review by saying clearly the armies of industry professionals that put beyoncé together aren 't sure of her core audience
a vague saturday night tv family entertainment feel gradually gives way to a more intriguing cross between liza minelli showbiz and thumping r b
however a ticker tape festooned crazy in love and a belting work it out suggest beyoncé is best sticking to her roots
bizarrely if implausibly she puts the carnage down to her tour manager falling off stage but at least she 's grasped one showbiz adage the show must go on
it was accompanied by a cd comprising three previously @-@ unreleased studio recorded songs and one remix each of crazy in love baby boy and naughty girl
behind @-@ the @-@ scenes footage can be also seen on the dvd
the album debuted at number seventeen on the billboard <num> selling <num> @,@ <num> copies in its first week
the dvd has been certified double platinum by the recording industry association of america for shipping <num> @,@ <num> copies
according to nielsen soundscan it had sold <num> @,@ <num> copies in the us by october <year> while as at october <num> <year> it had sold <num> @,@ <num> digital downloads
in an interview with the new york times in <year> american singer miranda lambert revealed that live at wembley inspired her to take little bits from that beyoncé performance for her live shows
originally a local hero from henan he was hired to continue yue fei 's military training in archery after the boy had rapidly mastered spearplay under his first teacher
in addition to the future general zhou accepted other children as archery pupils
during his tutelage zhou taught the children all of his skills and even rewarded yue with his two favorite bows because he was his best pupil
after zhou 's death yue would regularly visit his tomb twice a month and perform unorthodox sacrifices that far surpassed that done for even beloved tutors
yue later taught what he had learned from zhou to his soldiers and they were successful in battle
with the publishing of yue fei 's <num> folklore biography the story of yue fei <year> a new distinct fictional zhou tong emerged which differed greatly from his historical persona
not only was he now from shaanxi but he was yue 's adopted father a learned scholar with knowledge of the eighteen weapons of war and his personal name was spelled with a different yet related chinese character
the novel 's author portrayed him as an elderly widower and military arts tutor who counted lin chong and lu junyi two of the fictional <num> outlaws on which the water margin is based among his former pupils
a later republican era folktale by noted yangzhou storyteller wang shaotang not only adds wu song to this list but represents zhou as a knight @-@ errant with supreme swordsmanship
the tale also gives him the nickname iron arm which he shares with the executioner @-@ turned @-@ outlaw cai fu and makes the outlaw lu zhishen his sworn brother
because of his association with the outlaws he is often confused with the similarly named outlaw zhou tong
various wuxia novels and folk legends have endowed zhou with different kinds of martial and supernatural skills
these range from mastery of the bow double broadswords and chinese spear to that of wudang hard qigong and even x @-@ ray vision
practitioners of eagle claw chuojiao and xingyi commonly include him within their lineage history because of his association with yue fei the supposed progenitor of these styles
he is also linked to northern praying mantis boxing via lin chong and yan qing
wang shaotang 's folktale even represents him as a master of drunken eight immortals boxing
however the oldest historical record that mentions his name only says he taught archery to yue fei
nothing is ever said about him knowing or teaching a specific style of chinese martial arts
zhou has appeared in various forms of media such as novels comic books and movies
his rare <num> century biography iron arm golden sabre serves as a sequel to the story of yue fei because it details his adventures decades prior to taking yue as his pupil
this was later adapted into a ten volume lianhuanhua comic book
he also appears in a novel concerning one of his fictional martial arts brothers
he was portrayed by three different actors in a string of black and white yue fei films produced in the <num> and <num> one of which featured a ten @-@ year @-@ old sammo hung as the lead
veteran martial arts actor yu chenghui who played the sword @-@ wielding antagonist in jet li 's shaolin temple stated in a <year> interview that he has always wanted to portray zhou in a film
this two @-@ part memoir was completed in <num> some sixty years after the general 's political execution but was not published until <num>
it was later abridged in <num> and published in the yuan dynasty 's dynastic chronology history of the song dynasty under the title yue fei biography chapter <num> biography <num>
zhou 's mention in yue ke 's memoir was only briefly summarized in the yuan rewrite
it reads he yue fei learned archery from zhou tong
he learned everything and could fire with his left and right hands
after tong 's death he would offer sacrifices at his tomb
western washington university history professor edward kaplan explains zhou was a local hao 豪 heroic person
he comments hao can also mean a knight errant in poetic translation or in prosaic terms a professional strongman and bodyguard
this means zhou was a local hero from tangyin county anyang prefecture henan province the same area as yue fei
historical and scholarly sources spell his personal name as 同 tong meaning same or similar
this differs from the spelling present in fictional sources which will be further explained below
so 周同 represents the historical archer
he would stay up all night reading military strategy books and idolized such great historical heroes as guan yu
however the yue family was much too poor to afford military lessons for their son so yao dewang the boy 's maternal grandfather hired chen guang 陈广 to teach the eleven @-@ year @-@ old how to wield the chinese spear
yao was very surprised when his grandson quickly mastered the spear by the age of thirteen
zhou was then brought in to continue yue 's military training in archery
dr
kaplan describes zhou as the most important of the two teachers
a section of the jin tuo xu pian the second part of yue ke 's original published memoir describes one of zhou 's archery lessons and reveals that he took other children as his pupils one day chou t 'ung gathered his pupils for an archery session and to display his ability put three arrows in succession into the center of the target
pointing to the target to show grandfather yue fei he said after you can perform like this you can say you are an archer
grandfather thanked him and asked to be allowed to try
he drew his bow let fly his arrow and struck the end of t 'ung 's arrow
he shot again and again hit the mark
t 'ung was greatly amazed and subsequently presented to grandfather his two favorite bows
thereafter grandfather practiced still more until he was able to shoot to the left and right accurately letting fly the arrow as he moved
when he became a general he taught this to his officers and men so that his whole army became skilled at shooting to the left and right and frequently used this technique to crush the enemy 's spirit
the last sentence of the passage is similar to one from the republican era biography of song yue prince of e
but instead of teaching them his own technique it states yue taught what he had learned from zhou to his soldiers who were victorious in battle
following his passing yue became extremely depressed since zhou had been the greatest influence on his early life
zhou 's student would regularly visit his tomb on the first and fifteenth of every month with sacrifices of meat and wine and would shoot three arrows in succession with one of the two bows his tutor had presented him with it is never mentioned whether any of zhou 's other archery pupils came to visit his tomb
dr
kaplan comments this continuous unusual display of mourning went far beyond the ceremonial appropriate for even a highly respected teacher
noted sinologist hellmut wilhelm claims even though the display of grief was genuine it was also a way of emulating the stories of his heroic idols and establishing himself in the public eye
yue 's father later followed him secretly to zhou 's tomb after striking him during an argument over his melancholic behavior
there he saw him perform the unorthodox obediences involving the meat wine and three arrows
when he finally confronted him the son confessed that his gratitude for chou 's instruction could not be requited simply by the usual first and middle of the month ceremonies and so he
shot off the three arrows to symbolize that chou had been the source of his inspiration as an archer
dr
kaplan 's states this happened just prior to yue 's entrance into the army and that the entire event served as a symbol for yue 's entrance into responsible manhood
the chronology of yue wumu lists the events at zhou 's tomb happening in <num> when yue was nineteen but yue would have been eighteen in that year since he was born on the fifteenth day of the second month of <num>
the author of the original source material was using xusui age calculation in which a child is already considered one year old at birth
since yue joined the military shortly after zhou 's death a relative time frame can be given for when he died
during the early months of <num> the song empire mobilized its armed forces to assist the jurchen in confronting their common enemy the liao dynasty
therefore it appears that zhou died in late <num> before the call to arms was issued
the story of yue fei is a fictionalized retelling of yue fei 's young life military exploits and execution
it was written by a native of renhuo named qian cai 钱彩 who lived sometime between the reigns of the kangxi and qianlong emperors in the qing dynasty
the preface dates the book 's publication to <year>
it was deemed a threat by the qing emperors and banned during the qianlong era
in the novel zhou is portrayed as an elderly widower and yue 's only military arts tutor
the general 's historical spear master chen guang is never mentioned
zhou teaches yue fei and his sworn brothers military and literary arts from chapters two through five before his death
in the writing of his novel qian cai used a different character when spelling zhou 's given name
instead of the original character meaning similar it was changed to 侗 meaning rude or rustic
so 周侗 represents zhou 's distinct fictional persona
this spelling has even been carried over into modern day martial arts manuals
iron arm golden sabre was written by wang yun heng and xiao yun long and published in <year>
this novel which serves as zhou 's own fictional biography is a prequel to the story of yue fei because it details his adventures decades prior to taking yue fei as his student
it follows his life as a young martial arts instructor in the song army 's imperial guard his struggles against the xixia and liao tartar barbarian tribes and his tutelage of water margin outlaws
the last few chapters incorporate the storyline from the four chapters that he appears in the story of yue fei
this was later adapted into a ten volume lianhuanhua @-@ style comic book called the legend of zhou tong in <year>
he is taken as one of the pupils of shaolin master tan zhengfang 谭正芳 and learning the true essence of shaolin kungfu becomes proficient in things both literary and martial
tan 's other students include the future generals jin tai 金台 and zong ze 宗澤 and the future water margin outlaws sun li and luan tingyu
as a young man zhou catches the attention of judge bao zheng and enlists in the military as an officer
his superiors take note of his great skill after he helps his classmate general jin battle liao tartars in northern china and install him as a teacher in the capital imperial martial arts school
the school has three teaching positions named in order of prestige heaven earth and man
since he has the greatest skill he occupies the heaven position
he uses this post and his friendship with general zong to get their classmate sun li installed as the superintendent of forces of dengzhou
sun later becomes an outlaw under chao gai and helps defeat the evil zhu family who learn military arts from his classmate luan tingyu
as he grows older zhou becomes dissatisfied with politics because the imperial court chooses to appease the northern barbarian tribes instead of standing against them
he then devotes himself wholeheartedly to his martial arts practice and creates several official and authoritative techniques including the five step thirteen lance piercing kick which is a development of shaolin fanzi boxing and the zhou tong cudgel
he makes a concerted effort to transmit his martial efforts while teaching at the imperial martial arts school and formally accepts two disciples jade unicorn lu junyi and panther head lin chong
lu junyi is a millionaire with vast land holdings and does not hold office but lin chong inherits zhou 's position after his retirement and continues to serve as the lead instructor for the <num> @,@ <num> members of the song army 's imperial guard
during this time zhou tong also has an additional disciple named wu song
wu song becomes famous for killing a man @-@ eating tiger with his bare hands and is appointed as a constable in his native shandong
the county magistrate sun guoqin later sends wu on a mission to kaifeng with precious tiger bone balm in order to curry favor with influential personages
during his stay in the capital he makes the acquaintance of zhou
zhou finds wu to be a man of great strength but feels that he lacks refinement in his martial technique and therefore offers guidance for wu 's training
unfortunately these two men only interact for a brief two months before wu has to return home never to see zhou again
following his retirement zhou serves for a time as an advisor to general liu guangshi 劉光世 whose troops are garrisoned in henan province
but zhou later becomes an outlaw himself after he aids the heroes of the water margin and is forced to flee from government forces
meanwhile he learns his elderly classmate jin tai is close to death and hurries to shaolin where the general had become a buddhist monk after the murder of his family to pay his last respects
as the oldest of tan 's pupils jin orders zhou to find a talented youth to pass on all of his martial arts knowledge to
however this reunion is cut short when the troops track him to shaolin
he flees to wine spring mountain and lives in hiding for sometime before being invited by his old friend wang ming 王明 to become the precept of the wang family in unicorn village
wang 's son wang gui 王贵 tricks their maid 's son yue fei into completing their assignment while they go outside to play
after easily finishing the task at hand yue writes a heroic poem on a whitewashed wall and signs it with his name
the children then burst into the classroom upon learning of zhou 's forthcoming return and tell yue to escape in order to avoid apprehension
the old teacher eventually discovers the ruse and after marveling at yue 's impromptu ballad asks yue to fetch his mother lady yao 姚夫人 for an important meeting
with the entire wang household assembled in the main hall zhou asks the lady for her blessing to have the boy as his adopted son and student
she consents and yue takes his seat amongst zhou 's students the following morning
because zhou knows yue is poor he commands the four students to become sworn brothers
zhou also begins to teach yue all of the eighteen weapons of war
six years later zhou takes the group to visit his old friend the abbot of a small buddhist temple on the hill of dripping water
thirteen @-@ year @-@ old yue wanders behind the temple and finds the cave of dripping water in which lives a magical snake
when it lunges at yue he dodges to one side and pulls on its tail with his supernatural strength causing it to turn into an <num> @-@ foot @-@ long <num>
<num> m gold @-@ plated spear named the supernatural spear of dripping water
when they return home zhou begins to drill all of his students in the military arts — eighteen weapons of war archery and hand @-@ to @-@ hand combat
after three years of practice zhou enters them into a preliminary military examination in tangyin in which sixteen @-@ year @-@ old yue wins first place by shooting a succession of nine arrows through the bullseye of a target two hundred and forty paces away
after his display of marksmanship yue is asked to marry the daughter of li chun 李春 an old friend of zhou 's and the county magistrate who presided over the military exams
father and son then return home to their village
magistrate li writes out a marriage certificate and dispatches a messenger to deliver the document to yue fei in unicorn village
zhou and yue set out at dawn and travel back to tangyin to thank the magistrate for his generosity and kindness
there li prepares a great feast for them but when food is brought out for any servants that might have accompanied them zhou comments that they had come on foot without help
li decides to let yue pick from any one of his thousands of horses because every able military man needs a strong steed
after finishing their feast zhou and yue thank li once again and leave tangyin to return home
during their journey zhou recommends that yue run the horse to test its speed
yue spurs the horse on leaving zhou in pursuit
when they reach the village gate the two dismount and zhou returns to his study where he feels hot from the race and removes his outer garments to fan himself
but he soon falls ill and stays bedridden for seven days
then the book describes his death and burial
his phlegm bubbled up and he died
this was on the fourteenth day of the ninth month in the seventeenth year of the reign of xuan he and his age was seventy @-@ nine
buddhist and taoist priests were asked to come and chant prayers for seven times seven namely forty @-@ nine days
then the body was taken up to be buried beside the hill of dripping water
yue lives in a shed by his grave through the winter and in the second lunar month of the following year his martial brothers come and pull the building down forcing him to return home and take care of his mother
the quoted death date is not only unreliable because the book is fiction but also because the xuan he reign era of emperor huizong lasted only seven years <num> – <num> and not seventeen
although the story of yue fei states zhou died shortly before yue took a wife he historically died after yue married
it is likely that the original author invented this fictional date
but zhou comments that his old wife died and his small son was killed in battle against the liaos after leaving with the outlaw lu junyi to fight in the war
in the legend of zhou tong his wife is named meng cuiying 孟翠英 and his son is named zhou yunqing 周云清
he defeats meng in a lei tai martial arts contest and wins her as his wife
but she is shortly thereafter kidnapped by the wicked monks of the stone buddha temple
both zhou and meng eventually defeat the monks with their combined martial skills and later marry at the miaochuan pass in hubei province
zhou yunqing first appears as a fierce impulsive young man who rides his horse into the thick of enemy encampments wielding a long spear
he later dies in battle against the liao dynasty
after his son 's death zhou retreats to the xiangguo temple for a long morning period
he later takes seven @-@ year @-@ old yue fei as his adopted son and sole heir years after the boy 's father drowns in a great flood i see that he yue fei is clever and handsome and i an old man wish to have him as my adopted son
he need change neither his name nor his surname
i only want him to call me father temporarily so that i can faithfully transmit all the skills i have learned in my life to a single person
later when i die all he has to do is to bury my old bones in the earth and not allow them to be exposed and that is all
however after comparing events from the story of yue fei and an account of yue 's life from the sixteenth @-@ century work restoration of the great song dynasty the story of king yue 大宋中興岳王傳 literary critic c
t
hsia concluded that his father did not historically die in the flood and that although yueh fei showed almost filial regard for the memory of his teacher chou t 'ung 同 not 侗 the latter had not been his adopted father
the restoration of the great song was one of the earliest of four historical novels fictionalized dynastic chronologies written about yue during the ming dynasty all of which predate the story of yue fei
despite the addition of popular legends xiong damu fl <year> the author of the the story of king yue relied heavily on historical chronologies including zhu xi 's <num> – <num> outlines and details based on the t 'ung @-@ chien yue ke 's family memoir and the yuan dynasty 's official yue fei biography to write his story
so the story of yue fei was the first full @-@ blown fictionalized novel to introduce the adoption storyline
a modern folktale by noted yangzhou storyteller wang shaotang <year> – <year> whom folklore researcher vibeke børdahl called the unrivaled master of this the <num> century describes zhou thus he was beyond the age of fifty he was more than fifty and standing upright he measured about eight feet
his face had a golden tan arched brows a pair of bright eyes a regular head form a square mouth a pair of protruding ears and under his chin there were three locks of beard a grizzled beard
on his head he wore a sky @-@ blue satin scarf and he was dressed in a stately sky @-@ blue satin coat with a silken girdle a pair of wide black trousers without crotch and satin boots with thin soles
heroes and religious masters with above normal height are a recurring theme in chinese folklore
for instance his student wu song is said to be over nine feet tall in the same folktale
in the story of yue fei the general simultaneously duels with two other warriors vying for first place in a military exam one is nine feet tall and the other is eight feet tall
a hagiography of the taoist saint zhang daoling states he was over seven feet tall
when zhou is vocalized in yangzhou storytelling he speaks in square mouth public talk which is a manner of speaking reserved for martial heroes highly respected characters or sometimes lesser characters that pretend to be an important hero
square mouth public talk is actually a mixture of two forms of dialogue fangkou and guanbai
fangkou square mouth is a manner of steady yet forceful over pronunciation of dialogue that was possibly influenced by northern chinese opera
guanbai public talk is monologue and dialogue that is sometimes used for imposing heroes
this mixture of styles means zhou tong is treated as a highly regarded hero
in her analysis of yangzhou storytelling børdahl noted that the aforementioned tale about zhou and wu song uses different forms of dialogue for both characters
wu speaks square mouth utilizing standard mandarin without rusheng short glottal syllables
on the contrary zhou speaks squaremouth using the yangzhou tone system which does utilize rusheng syllables
therefore she believes square mouth dialogue should at least be divided into two subcategories namely the wu song variant — without rusheng and the zhou tong variant — with rusheng
<year> is a ming dynasty military romance about one hundred and eight demons @-@ born @-@ men and women who band together to rebel against the lavish song dynasty government
lin chong and lu junyi two of these outlaws are briefly mentioned as being zhou 's previous students in the story of yue fei
they are not characters within the main plot though as both are killed by villainous officials prior to zhou becoming precept of the wang household
most importantly the two were not among his historical students since they are fictional characters
zhou 's portrayal as their teacher is connected to a recurring element in chinese fiction where tang and song dynasty heroes train under a celestial master usually a taoist immortal prior to their military exploits
c
t
hsia suggests the mold from which all other similar teachers are cast is guiguzi master of the feuding strategists sun bin and pang juan from the yuan dynasty tale latter volume of the spring and autumn annals of the seven kingdoms 七國春秋後集
hsia goes on to say that qian cai yue 's fictional biographer associated zhou with the outlaws because most such teachers in the military romance genre are celestials with at least two students
but in adopting this format qian reversed the traditional pattern of celestial tutelage since zhou is written as a human while his students are reincarnations of demons lin and lu and the celestial bird garuda yue fei
although lin and lu have been connected to zhou since the early qing dynasty wu song did not become associated with him until wang shaotang created a <num> @-@ century folktale in which the two meet in kaifeng
the tale takes place during wu 's mission to kaifeng but before the murder of his older brother wu dalang
zhou teaches wu the rolling dragon style of swordplay during the constable 's one @-@ month stay in the capital city
this tale was chapter two of wang 's ten chapters on wu song storytelling repertoire which was later transcribed and published in the book wu sung in <year>
it eventually carried over into the storyline of iron arm golden sabre and subsequently the legend of zhou tong
in the latter version wu instead learns chuo jiao boxing from zhou during a two month stay in the capital
wang 's tale portrays zhou as an aging itinerant swordmaster with a fame reverberating like thunder throughout the underworld society of jianghu
he is made the sworn brother of the outlaw flowery monk lu zhishen a military officer @-@ turned @-@ fighting monk who is according to hsia first among the most popular protagonists of the water margin
he is also given the nickname iron arm 铁臂膀 which carried over into the title of his fictional biography iron arm golden sabre
while the tale fails to explain the reason for the moniker it does mention zhou 's ability to direct his qi to any part of his body to make it hard enough to overpower the iron shirt technique of another martial artist
furthermore zhou shares the same nickname with cai fu an executioner @-@ turned @-@ outlaw known for his ease in wielding a heavy sword
because of his association with these outlaws zhou is often confused with the similarly named outlaw little conqueror zhou tong
in the water margin this zhou tong is a bandit chief of mount peach blossom whom lu zhishen beats for trying to forcibly marry the daughter of the liu family
he dies later under the sword of li tianrun an officer in the rebel army of fang la
so the connection between both zhou 's is based solely on the romanized transcription of their name
he teaches them literary and military lessons on even and odd days
the novel says yue is talented in all manners of literary and military matters and even surpasses the skill of lin and lu
after yue acquires his supernatural spear of dripping water zhou tutors all of his students in the eighteen weapons of war but each excels with one in particular yue fei and tang huai the spear zhang xian the hook @-@ sickle spear and wang gui the yanyue dao
all of them learn the skill of archery in addition
some of these and other children are mentioned in yue ke 's memoir as being his grandfather 's historical childhood friends but they are never specified as being zhou 's students
books written by modern @-@ day martial artists make many claims that are not congruent with historical documents or current scholarly thought
for instance internalist yang jwing @-@ ming says zhou was a scholar who studied martial arts in the shaolin monastery and later took yue as his student after the young man worked as a tenant farmer for the official @-@ general han qi 韓琦 <num> – <num>
during this time he learned all types of military weapons horseback riding and hand @-@ to @-@ hand combat
the general later created xingyi and eagle claw boxing from his internal and external training under zhou
however history prof
meir shahar notes that unarmed boxing styles did not develop at shaolin until the late ming dynasty
he also states that ji family memoirs and qing dynasty records suggest xingyi was created hundreds of years after the death of yue by a spearplayer named ji jike fl
<year>
in addition the appearance of han qi in the story is a chronological anachronism since he died nearly <num> years before yue 's birth
yue historically worked as a tenant farmer and bodyguard for descendants of han qi in <num> after leaving the military upon the death of his father in late <num> but he learned from zhou well before this time
eagle claw grandmasters leung shum and lily lau believe jow tong the cantonese rendering of his name was a monk who brought young yue to the shaolin monastery and taught him a set of hand techniques which yue later adapted to create his ying kuen eagle fist
liang shouyu states practitioners of emei dapeng qigong believe yue trained under zhou as a child and competed to become china 's top fighter at an early age
their lineage story dictates zhou also took yue to a buddhist hermit who taught him said qigong style
northern praying mantis master yuen mankai says zhou taught yue the same school of martial arts as he did his water margin students and that the general was the originator of the praying mantis technique black tiger steeling sic heart
although martial arts historian stanley henning admits that yue 's biographies do not mention boxing he says he yue almost certainly did practice some form of bare handed fighting to prepare for his weapons training
but he does not suggest who yue might have learned it from
contemporary records never once mention zhou teaching yue boxing
despite this various wuxia novels and folk legends have attributed many different military and supernatural skills to zhou
these range from mastery of the bow double swords and chinese spear to that of wudang hard qigong chuojiao boxing and even x @-@ ray vision
wang shaotang 's folktale even represents him as a master of drunken eight immortals boxing
zhou can also be linked to these combat arts through his historical and folklore students
practitioners of eagle claw chuojiao and xingyi commonly include him within their lineage history because of his association with yue fei the supposed progenitor of these styles
yuen mankai believes zhou taught lin chong and lu junyi the same school of martial arts that was later combined with seventeen other schools to create mantis fist
this combination of various schools refers to an eighteenth @-@ century martial arts manual that describes the gathering of eighteen masters at the shaolin monastery that supposedly took place during the early years of the song dynasty
lin chong and yan qing are listed as two of the eighteen masters invited which means their skills of mandarin duck leg and ground fighting are treated as two separate schools instead of one
but he believes mantis fist was created during the ming dynasty and was therefore influenced by these eighteen schools from the song
he also says lu junyi taught yan qing the same martial arts as he learned from zhou
very few references are made to the people who supposedly taught martial arts to zhou
in the legend of zhou tong he learns as a child from a shaolin master named tan zhengfang
practitioners of chuojiao claim he learned the style from its creator a wandering taoist named deng liang
practitioners of geok gar kuen a style attributed to yue fei believe he studied under han de a chivalrous person from shaanxi
apart from the story of yue fei and iron arm golden sabre he appears in a novel based around his older martial arts brother jin tai
a recent graphic novel of the story of yue fei deletes all mythological elements from the storyline and presents it in a historical manner
instead of traveling from hebei to hubei to inspect land zhou travels from shaanxi to kaifeng city in henan to visit an old friend who had been promoted to general
while en route to the capital city zhou takes note of a great famine plaguing the peasantry and even hears stories of some people resorting to cannibalism
however when he arrives in kaifeng he sees the empire is wasting money on the construction of large imperial gardens the court officials cai jing and wang pu have extravagant residencies and hears that even eunuchs are rich because they are given high government posts
upon locating his friend zhou is distressed to find him in stocks and shackles and being escorted to the farthest reaches of china by imperial guards
he later learns that the general had accidentally offended some court officials and was sentenced to permanent exile on some trumped up charges
apparently having little or no money zhou decides to visit wang ming in hubei mistakenly called hebei and becomes the estate 's tutor
another noticeable difference in the storyline takes place when zhou travels with his teenage disciples to visit his friend the abbot
instead of yue wandering behind the temple to battle the magical snake he stays with zhou and the abbot while the other disciples go off to explore
zhou watches as the abbot tests yue 's strength by asking him to move an ornate three @-@ hundred pound copper stove dating from the han dynasty
the abbot then lifts a stone floor tile and presents the boy with a large book on military strategy
he goes on to tell yue how he was once a great soldier who fought in campaigns against the liao and western xia empires but became a monk after the song agreed to become a vassal of each state
he later made a name for himself by teaching military skills to youths from the surrounding area
since he has no heir of his own the abbot presents yue with his own personal spear and instructs him in the proper use of the weapon
zhou kindly protests the gift at first but allows yue to keep it out of friendship
a second graphic novelization drastically changes the storyline involving zhou
like the original zhou becomes the tutor of the wang estate but when news of his arrival prompts rich families to send their sons to learn from him he is forced to accept droves of these students on a trial basis
he eventually chooses his friends sons as his indoor disciples and yue as his godchild
years later he takes his now teenage students not to see the buddhist abbot but to teach them military strategy out in the mountain wilderness
yue senses trouble after his martial brothers separate to explore the forest and rushes off to rescue them only to be confronted by a monstrous snake
after vanquishing the beast with his sword yue discovers a magic glowing spear within a cave and reports back to zhou
following their training zhou becomes ill from overexposure to the cold mountain air on the return trip home and dies soon after
instead of just yue all of his students live beside his grave for a mourning period of one hundred days before returning home to their families
these events take place three years before zhou originally died in the story of yue fei
stories including zhou have also been used to educate
the secondary school system of hong kong teaches children the value of mentorship by making them read about the close teacher @-@ pupil relationship between zhou and yue
a morale tale called yue fei studies archery in children 's pictorial a chinese magazine tailored for children ages two through seven demonstrates how great achievements are only made possible via diligent practice
the story states how young yue stumbles upon zhou 's training hall in a neighboring town while gathering fire wood
yue applies to become a student but zhou tells him he must first practice the art of the far @-@ sighted person by staring into the morning sun to improve his eyesight
after years of unrelenting practice yue is able to spot a lone goose flying off in the distance and two cicadas on a tree far into the forest
zhou then officially takes him as his disciple and adopted son
under his tutelage yue is able to master the eighteen weapons of war and to shoot a falling leaf from one @-@ hundred paces away
he is mentioned numerous times in author robert liparulo 's thriller deadlock <year>
zhou is first featured in chapter eight during a conversation between the main character john hutch hutchinson a journalist bent on stopping the maniacal plans of a billionaire madman and his friend 's young son dillon an archery enthusiast
when hutch asks him if he had ever heard of the archery @-@ champion @-@ turned @-@ actor howard hill dillon replies i don 't think so
you told me about zhou tong
hutch then says oh yeah
zhou tong was something
taught the song dynasty to be the best military archers in history
but howard hill was the best
later in chapter fifty while hutch is trailing a killer through an airport a page goes out over the intercom system for a mr
zhou tong
when the page goes out again hutch muses zhou tong had been a famous archery teacher and military arts tutor in the song dynasty
dillon and i had long telephone conversations about him because of tong 's blending of archery skills and self @-@ discipline
he was an inspiration to me
dillon had sensed that and wanted to known everything about him
he finally realizes that the page had to have been left by dillon 's mother laura to catch his attention
the page is sent to warn him of a trap but hutch receives it too late
screen actors who have portrayed zhou in film 's from the <num> and <num> include wong sau nin li ming and jing ci bo
jing starred alongside a ten @-@ year @-@ old sammo hung who played young yue fei
veteran martial arts actor yu chenghui who played the sword @-@ wielding antagonist in jet li 's shaolin temple stated in a <year> newspaper interview that he never shaved his trademark beard even at the request of movie producers because he wanted to portray zhou in a future film
he went on to say he is an outstandingly able person from the northern and southern song dynasties and many water margin heroes are his disciples
this person is very important in the martial arts and many people want to portray him in films
in recent years full professionalisation and a major equipment overhaul have transformed the nature of the force
the romanian land forces were founded on <num> november o
s
<num> november <year>
they participated in world war i together with the russian empire forces in actions against the central powers and despite initial setbacks won the decisive battles of mărăşti and mărăşeşti
during most of world war ii until august <num> <year> romanian forces supported the axis powers fighting against the soviet union on the eastern front
from august <year> until the end of the war romania fought against germany under the control of the soviet union
when the communists seized power after the second world war the army underwent reorganisation and sovietization
following the romanian revolution due to shortage of funds many units were disbanded and much equipment was phased out
likewise romanian military capability declined because of a lack of fuel as well as training
however since the late <num> a number of positive changes have come about and the level of combat readiness is growing greatly since <year> the military budget has grown more than four times rising from <num> million dollars to <num>
<num> billion dollars in <year>
conscription has been abolished and professionalisation has been completed
the land forces must independently or together with other romanian military branches conduct operations and defensive or offensive battles for capture or destruction of the invading enemy being part of national or multinational military structures
a part of the units which compose the current operational structure of the land forces must be able to conduct military operations outside the national territory together with the international military forces
however magheru rapidly ordered his troops to disband when the ottoman forces swept into bucharest to stop the revolution
in <year> at the request of nikolai konstantinovich grand duke of russia the romanian army fused with the russian forces and led by king carol i fought in what was to become the romanian war of independence
they participated in the siege of plevna and several other battles
the romanians won the war but suffered about <num> @,@ <num> casualties
until world war i the romanian army didn 't face any other serious actions
although some <num> @,@ <num> troops were mobilised the romanians met little resistance in bulgaria and as such this is not considered a major conflict in romanian history
this was due to historical claims on land
this area no longer belongs to romania
the romanian armies entered transylvania then part of the austro @-@ hungarian empire together with russian forces
however german forces under the command of general erich von falkenhayn stalled the attack in november <year> and drove back the romanians
at the same time austrian and turkish troops invaded southern romania forcing the country into a two @-@ front war
the central powers drove deep into romania and conquered the south of the country wallachia including bucharest by the end of <year>
the romanian forces led by marshal constantin prezan retreated into the north @-@ east part of romania moldavia
in the summer of <year> however prezan aided by the future marshal general ion antonescu successfully defended the remaining unoccupied territories against german and austro @-@ hungarian forces led by field marshal august von mackensen
general alexandru averescu led the second army in the victories of the battle of mărăşti july <num> to august <num> <year> and the battle of mărăşeşti august <num> to september <num> <year>
as a result of the russian revolution romania was left isolated and unable to continue the war and was forced to sign the treaty of bucharest with the central powers
later on in <year> germany agreed in the treaty of versailles article <num> to renounce all the benefits provided to it by the treaty of bucharest in <year>
after the successful offensive on the thessaloniki front which put bulgaria out of the war romania re @-@ entered the war on november <num> <year> a day before its end in the west
as a result in april <year> the newly established hungarian soviet republic vowed to retake the region by force and hungarian troops attacked romanian formations in transylvania
the romanian army defeated the hungarians and conquered budapest in august <year>
from <year> to <year> in transylvania inspectorate general of army no
<num> had subordinate the <num> and <num> army corps
by <num> april <year> when he disbanded forces western command to order <num> army corps and earlier structures have been generals prezan constantin constantin christescu traian mosoiu mardarescu george nicholas and arthur văitoianu et al
after <num> april <year> to <num> march <year> c

was commissioned by general nicholas petal danila pop hanzu alexander john prodan motas dumitru gheorghe florescu and christie doe prominent military leaders whom octavian goga wrote that in the interwar period in cluj in transylvania commanders have made a large @-@ scale opera and unanimous praise
three divisions were part of <num> army corps <num> dej <num> oradea and <num> infantry divisions targu @-@ mureş
with rapid and marked worsening international situation especially in neighboring romania on <num> september <year> the <num> army recently founded became army group command no
<num> of transylvania
an expeditionary force invaded the soviet union in bessarabia and southern ukraine alongside the german wehrmacht
the expeditionary force army group antonescu was composed on <num> june <year> of the <num> army the <num> army the <num> army corps and the <num> infantry division
the <num> army comprised the <num> army corps <num> and <num> infantry divisions the cavalry corps the mountain corps two separate artillery battalion a ta unit and the air force 's <num> army cooperation command
the <num> army consisted of the <num> army corps the <num> army corps the <num> army corps two fortress brigades and the <num> army cooperation command
the army group @-@ level <num> army corps under major general n
macici controlled the <num> and <num> infantry divisions and the <num> cavalry brigade
additionally the 1st armoured division was formed for service on the eastern front
the army group 's first offensive in conjunction with the eleventh army operation munchen enabled romania to retake the territory immediately east of the dnister former part of moldavia
the romanian armies saw their first major battles at odessa and sevastopol and in <year> advanced with other axis forces deeper into soviet territory during operation blue
the greatest disaster for the romanian expeditionary force on the eastern front came at stalingrad where during the soviet counter @-@ offensive of november <year> the thinly spread forces of the third army deployed north of stalingrad and of the fourth army deployed south of stalingrad were attacked by vastly superior soviet forces and suffered combined losses of some <num> @,@ <num> personnel
during april – may <year> the romanian forces led by general mihai racoviţǎ together with elements of the german eighth army were responsible for defending northern romania during the soviet first jassy @-@ kishinev offensive and took part in the battles of târgu frumos
in late august <year> the red army entered eastern romania
on august <num> <year> a coup led by king michael i of romania deposed marshal antonescu and set up a pro @-@ soviet government
it has been estimated that the royal coup shortened the war for romania by six months
romania soon declared war on nazi germany and the first and fourth armies were pressed into action
after the expelling of the last wehrmacht remnants from romania the romanian armies took part in the siege of budapest and the prague offensive of may <year>
at the onset pro @-@ german elements were purged from the romanian armed forces
in <year> – <num> two divisions were formed out of romanian volunteers — ex @-@ prisoners of war trained and indoctrinated in the soviet union during the war but also of many communist activists
one was the tudor vladimirescu first volunteer division under the command of colonel nicolae cambrea and the other the horia cloşca şi crişan division under the command of general mihail lascăr who later served as minister of defence from <year> to <year>
these two units formed the nucleus of the new romanian land forces under soviet control
the postwar reorganisation of the land forces included cavalry but the arm disappeared from the force with the disbandment in november <year> of the <num> cavalry division at oradea
after the romanian communist party seized political power the sovietization of the army commenced under the supervision of the new minister of defence emil bodnăraş
thirty per cent of the officers and noncommissioned officers mostly experienced soldiers and a potential source of opposition were purged from the military
this involved copying the soviet model of military and political organisation and changing the military doctrine of combat and defence also in the context of romania 's integration in the strategic system of the soviets at the beginning of the cold war
in the early <num> the rlf reached a level of <num> rifle one mechanised and one tank division
between <year> and <year> the rifle and mechanised divisions were converted to motor rifle divisions and reductions in strength began force size dropped to six motor rifle and two tank divisions by <year>
from <year> to <year> three more motor rifle divisions were formed but one was deactivated in <year> and the eight motor rifle and three tank division figure remained that way for the rest of the cold war
from <year> to <year> the country seems to have been divided into three major military regions cluj bacău and bucharest in the west east and south respectively
in wartime the land forces in each military region would become an army corps with their headquarters in cluj @-@ napoca iaşi and bucharest
armies seem to have succeeded military regions in <year> and three armies seem to have become four in <year>
what is known is that on <num>
<num>
<year> fourth army became <num> military region based in cluj
the <num> military region became the <num> army on <num> april <year> and the <num> army on <num> april <year>
during the <num> the land forces numbered <num> @,@ <num> personnel of whom two thirds were conscripts
in <year> four armies appeared to exist the first army at bucharest second army at buzau third army at craiova and fourth army at napoca
in <year> the land forces consisted of eight mechanised infantry divisions 1st bucharest <num> craiova <num> constanta <num> iași <num> oradea <num> timişoara <num> and 81st tirgu mureş two tank divisions the <num> tank division at bucharest and the <num> tank division at tirgu mureş four mountain infantry brigades and three airborne brigades
according to the <num> @-@ year history of modern romanian artillery in <year> the 1st army consisted of the 1st mech div <num> tank div

1st mountain bde <num> mountain bde and <num> tactical missile brigade
motorised rifle divisions were organized along the soviet model with three motorised rifle regiments one tank regiment and a full complement of <num> @,@ <num> infantry soldiers
the artillery antitank and air defence regiments of divisions provided specialised fire support that enabled motorised rifle and tank regiments to maneuver
the air defense regiments consisted of two anti @-@ aircraft artillery battalions and one surface @-@ to @-@ air missile sam battalion each composed of several batteries
in the late <num> the artillery regiments of motorised rifle and tank divisions included two artillery battalions one multiple rocket launcher battalion and one surface @-@ to @-@ surface missile battalion
surface @-@ to @-@ surface missile battalions were divided into three or four batteries each equipped with one missile launcher
they operated thirty frog @-@ <num> and eighteen scud missile launchers
the frog @-@ <num> a tactical missile first introduced in <year> was being replaced in other non @-@ soviet warsaw pact armies
proven to be fairly inaccurate in combat frog and scud missiles would be ineffective weapons carrying conventional high @-@ explosive warheads
tipped with nuclear or chemical warheads however they could be devastating
according to one former romanian official writing in <year> romania produced chemical agents that could be delivered by battlefield missiles
the whole land forces structure was reorganized from armies into territorial corps and from regiments into battalions
in the mid @-@ <num> the situation of the land forces was critical the military budget was three times lower than in <year> <num> million dollars <num> of the equipment was older than <num> years and <num> of the armoured vehicles and <num> of the missile units were non @-@ operational
due to lack of fuel and training the level of combat readiness and military capability was extremely low only about <num> of the entire land forces were operational
however after <year> the government took serious action the military budget was increased greatly and modernisation of equipment commenced
officially the program to modernize and restructure the armed forces began on <num> april <year>
many of these units have been restructured however as part of the <year> force plan
currently about <num> @,@ <num> military personnel and <num> @,@ <num> civilians comprise the armed forces for a total of <num> @,@ <num> men and women
out of these <num> @,@ <num> cca
<num> @,@ <num> are in the land forces
as of <year> the first short @-@ term stage was completed reorganisation of the command system implementation of the voluntary military service
the year <year> marks the end of the second stage operational integration in nato and eu while <year> is the date when the long @-@ term stage is to be completed full technical integration in nato and eu
the stages aim at modernising the structure of the armed forces reducing the personnel as well as acquiring newer and improved technology that is compatible with nato standards
romania abolished compulsory military service on october <num> <year>
this came about due to a <year> constitutional amendment which allowed the parliament to make military service optional
the romanian parliament voted to abolish conscription in october <year> with the vote formalising one of many military modernisation and reform programmes that romania agreed to when it joined nato in march <year>
the main combat formations of romania are the <num> infantry division getica and the <num> infantry division gemina
until <year> the romanian land forces fielded a third division namely the 1st division dacia
before june <year> the 1st and <num> divisions were known as the 1st territorial army corps and the <num> territorial army corps and in turn they used to be called the 1st army and <num> army prior to <year>
however due to their personnel having been reduced considerably in order to reach compatibility with nato standards they were renamed and reorganized as divisions
in <year> the joint hq command was renamed as <num> infantry division getica and received units from the 1st and the <num> infantry divisions
the current chief of the romanian land forces staff is major general nicolae ciucă who succeeded major general mircea savu on <num> january <year>
the land forces official day is celebrated each year on <num> april
the tr @-@ <num> bizon main battle tank and the mli @-@ <num> jder infantry fighting vehicle are the most modern native made equipment of the romanian land forces
also <num> ex @-@ german gepard anti @-@ aircraft systems were commissioned in late @-@ <year>
the land forces ordered about <num> us army humvees the first eight were delivered to the military police in december <year>
<num> piranha iii armoured vehicles lav iii variant and <num> uro vamtac high mobility vehicles were also ordered in <year> for deployment in iraq and afghanistan
it later became the <num> special operations brigade on <num> october <year> composed of a special operations battalion two paratrooper battalions and a logistic battalion
the most famous and well trained unit is the 1st special operations battalion vulturii which was legally created in late <year> after several batches of graduates had already been selected
members of the special forces battalion have benefitted from courses abroad such as the us army special forces green berets course the united states marine corps force recon course as well as other courses
the special forces battalion became fully operational during <year> after a company had already been commissioned in early @-@ <year>
the current romanian reconnaissance battalions the <num> the <num> and the <num> are also considered special forces units and were formed in the <num> during the communist regime
after the revolution the units suffered from a lack of funds which resulted in the temporary disbandment of the <num> battalion
however their equipment was completely overhauled in the past few years and the combat readiness and capabilities have regained full strength
dir rapid intervention squad of the romanian ministry of defense is an elite special operations unit currently belonging to the romanian military police
it is a special unit inside the military formed of highly skilled individuals a very large percentage of its members being champions in martial arts kickboxing athletic disciplines and so on
dir was until december <year> top secret
currently the military schools and training units of the romanian land forces are directly subordinated to the central headquarters
there are <num> military high schools câmpulung moldovenesc alba iulia and breaza one military academy sibiu one officers school piteşti <num> training schools sibiu piteşti buzău and <num> training battalions
in the past few years lots of training exercises took place in romania with other balkan or allied countries
most of these exercises took place at babadag which is one of the largest and most modern training firing ranges and military facilities in europe with a total surface area of <num> square kilometres
it was announced on december <num> <year> that <num> @,@ <num> u
s
troops stationed at mihail kogălniceanu which in time will form joint task force east will be using babadag as a training base
the marshal rank can be given only in wartime by the president of romania in fact romania had only three marshals coming from the officers` rank in its history ion antonescu alexandru averescu and constantin prezan
kings ferdinand i carol ii and mihai i also held the rank of marshal of romania
king carol i held simultaneous ranks as russian marshal and german field @-@ marshal
the film was written and directed by mark hartley who interviewed over eighty australian american and british actors directors screenwriters and producers including quentin tarantino brian trenchard @-@ smith jamie lee curtis dennis hopper george lazenby george miller barry humphries stacy keach and john seale
hartley spent several years writing a detailed research document which served to some degree as a script for the film about the new wave era of australian cinema
it focused on the commonly overlooked ozploitation films — mainly filled with sex horror and violence — which critics and film historians considered vulgar and offensive often excluded from australia 's official film history
hartley approached quentin tarantino a longtime ozploitation fan who had dedicated his <year> film kill bill to the exploitation genre and tarantino agreed to help get the project off the ground
hartley then spent an additional five years interviewing subjects and editing the combined <num> hours of interviews and original stock footage into a <num> @-@ minute film
not quite hollywood which premiered at the <year> melbourne international film festival did not perform well at the box office upon its australia @-@ wide release but garnered universally positive reviews from critics and a nomination for best documentary at the <year> australian film institute awards
from <year> through to the late <num> australian directors began to take advantage of the newly introduced r @-@ rating which allowed more on @-@ screen nudity sex and violence for audiences restricted to age <num> and over
ozploitation — writer @-@ director mark hartley 's own portmanteau of australian exploitation — was a subgenre of the new wave which accounted for the critically panned gross @-@ out comedies sex romps action and road movies teen films westerns thrillers and horror films of the era commonly overlooked in australia 's official film history
the film addresses three main categories of ozploitation films sex horror and action
after becoming an accomplished music video director his interest in this era of australian filmmaking grew and he spent years researching a potential documentary film
he was close to giving up on the project when he sent a <num> @-@ page draft of the script to american film director quentin tarantino not expecting to receive a reply
tarantino was a longtime fan of ozploitation films and had even dedicated his film kill bill to brian trenchard @-@ smith 's work
he replied the day after telling hartley that he would do whatever he could to get the film made
hartley traveled to los angeles california to meet with tarantino who agreed to sit for hours of interviews as one of the film 's most prominent interviewees
hartley spent the following five years interviewing other actors directors screenwriters and producers collecting original stock footage and then cutting the <num> hours of interviews and <num> hours of film footage down into a <num> @-@ minute film
its australia @-@ wide release was a month later on <num> august <year> and it had its overseas premiere at the toronto film festival on <num> september <year> where distribution rights were secured for the united kingdom canada france russia germany and benelux

sandra hall writing for the sydney morning herald gave the film three and a half out of five stars believing that hartley 's own film is much livelier than most of those he is out to celebrate
jake wilson of the age similarly gave the film three and a half stars but called the film basically a feature @-@ length advertisement for its subject saying that it moves far too rapidly to permit sustained analysis
the courier @-@ mail 's des partidge who gave the film four and a half out of five stars disagreed saying that brisk editing means the history is lively and fun and claimed in homage to the castle copies of hartley 's film should go straight to pool rooms all over australia when it becomes available on dvd
luke goodsell of empire magazine australasia gave not quite hollywood five out of five stars calling the film fast thrilling and often ribald while leigh paatsch wrote for the herald sun that there is not a single instant where boredom can possibly intrude dubbing the film an incredibly energetic and merrily messed @-@ up celebration of australian b @-@ movies
english director edgar wright named not quite hollywood his fourth favourite film of <year> and called it the best documentary ever

babyface houston and some other african @-@ american female singers recorded songs for the album
the song was one of the final additions to the soundtrack
why does it hurt so bad was originally written by babyface for houston two years prior to the release of waiting to exhale but houston refused to record it at that time
i wasn 't really in the mood for singing about why it hurts so bad said houston
two years later according to chris willman of entertainment weekly the emotions of the movie merged with the real @-@ life circumstances of houston 's troubled marriage to bobby brown

craig lytle of allmusic noted that houston 's voice sailed through the song
christopher john farley of time commented houston particularly held her own with a masterly balance of pop zip and soulful melancholy

a writer for boston herald noted that the song was understated
similarly larry flick of billboard commented that the song should have been released as the follow @-@ up to exhale shoop shoop
paired with babyface houston is positively luminous on this heartbreak ballad performing with a perfect blend of theatrical melodrama and guttural soul he added
deborah wilker of south florida sun @-@ sentinel was mixed in her review commenting that the song was a predictably histrionic follow @-@ up to exhale shoop shoop
but nick krewen of the spectator was even less enthusiastic writing
the two guaranteed whitney houston hits – exhale shoop shoop and why does it hurt so bad – don 't really offer anything new
similarly cary darling of rome news @-@ tribune gave a negative review

forming out of a tropical disturbance on october <num> omar initially moved slowly in the eastern caribbean sea
by october <num> omar began to quickly intensify as deep convection developed around the center of circulation
later that day an eye developed and the storm began to accelerate to the northeast
early on october <num> omar reached its peak intensity with winds of <num> mph <num> km h and a barometric pressure of <num> mbar hpa <num>
<num> inhg
shortly after the hurricane rapidly weakened to category <num> intensity
after slightly re @-@ strengthening the next day omar weakened to a tropical storm before degenerating into a non @-@ convective low pressure area
the remnants of omar persisted until october <num> at which time it dissipated to the west of the azores
throughout the eastern caribbean omar affected numerous islands most of which only recorded minor impacts
large swells and heavy rains impacted the abc islands
antigua and barbuda sustained <num> million in damages mainly on antigua as nine homes were destroyed several others damaged and many farms were inundated by flood waters
one person died in puerto rico after suffering a stress @-@ induced cardiac arrest
the united states virgin islands also sustained significant damage costing roughly <num> million
numerous boats and homes were damaged and over <num> power poles were snapped
total losses from the storm were estimated at <num> million
deep convection formed around a prominent mid @-@ level circulation as it moved towards the west
however the convection diminished on october <num> before entering the caribbean sea a week later
upon entering the caribbean sea shower and thunderstorm activity redeveloped around the low
continued development followed and the low was designated as tropical depression fifteen at <num> utc on october <num> while located about <num> miles <num> kilometres south of the southeastern tip of the dominican republic
the previous steady westward motion that the system took across the atlantic halted as it entered an area of weak steering currents and significant motion was not expected for another day or two
as the structure of the storm improved it was upgraded to a tropical storm and the national hurricane center nhc gave it the name omar
located to the southeast of a broad and deep tropospheric trough and to the west of a low to mid @-@ level ridge omar took a counter @-@ clockwise turn on october <num>
upon becoming a tropical storm omar began to undergo an extended period of rapid intensification as very deep convection developed around the center of circulation
wind shear around the storm which was previously inhibiting quick development weakened allowing for further strengthening
later that day an <num>
<num> to <num>
<num> mi <num>
<num> to <num>
<num> km wide eye formed as the storm began to turn towards the northeast due to the trough
with the formation of an eye the dvorak technique rendered an intensity of <num> mph <num> km h signifying that omar had intensified into a hurricane
the intensification briefly stalled as the eyewall eroded and the center of the storm became slightly elliptical
however deep convection persisted and strengthening was forecast as the storm neared puerto rico
shortly after the eye quickly became well @-@ defined and appeared on visible satellite images an indication the storm was intensifying
the chances of rapid intensification were good as the storm featured well @-@ developed outflow and prominent banding features
with very warm sea surface temperatures high ocean heat content low wind shear and a moist air mass omar quickly reached its peak intensity early on october <num> as a category <num> hurricane with winds of <num> mph <num> km h
during the intensification phase the forward motion of the hurricane increased to <num> mph <num> km h
once in the atlantic ocean omar began to rapidly weaken with winds decreasing by <num> mph <num> km h in <num> hours
visible satellite images depicted an exposed low @-@ level circulation with convection displaced to the east due to a combination of very high wind shear and dry air
by october <num> most of the deep convection associated with the system dissipated however a brief decrease in wind shear allowed omar to re @-@ strengthen to its secondary peak with winds of <num> mph <num> km h

the sacred college of cardinals was divided into two blocs pro @-@ jesuits and anti @-@ jesuits but several cardinals were neutral
the pro @-@ jesuit faction called zelanti grouped italian curial cardinals who opposed the secular influences on the church
their leaders were gian francesco and alessandro albani and cardinal @-@ nephew of the deceased pope carlo rezzonico
the anti @-@ jesuit bloc called also court faction grouped crown @-@ cardinals of the catholic powers france spain and naples
respectively ruled at the time by louis xv of france charles iii of spain and ferdinand iii of sicily ferdinand iv of naples
in spite of the national divisions they worked together for the main goal – suppression of the society of jesus
the bourbon courts had decided to put the official leadership of this bloc in the hands of the french cardinal de bernis
he and his colleagues were instructed to block every pro @-@ jesuit candidature even with the official exclusion if necessary
several cardinals among them lorenzo ganganelli did not belong to either faction
the spanish and neapolitan governments had classified forty three italian cardinals into five categories good eleven cardinals indifferent eight doubtful three bad fifteen and very bad six cardinal orsini the official representative of the neapolitan court and all the foreigners were not classified because it was certain that none of them would be ever elected pope
the french government was more fastidious than spanish and neapolitan
only three cardinals were considered good candidates conti durini and ganganelli out of these <num> cardinals only <num> or <num> were actually considered papabile while the remaining <num> were excluded due to their age or health
initially only <num> cardinals participated
zelanti taking advantage of the small number of the electors and the absence of the french and spanish cardinals tried to achieve a quick election of cardinal flavio chigi
in one ballot he was only two votes short of being elected
the efforts of zelanti met with strong protests from the ambassadors of france and spain but fortunately for them cardinal orsini protector of the kingdom of naples and the only crown @-@ cardinal present in the early ballots was able to join some neutral cardinals to block chigi ’ s candidature
an unprecedented event was the visit of joseph ii holy roman emperor who arrived incognito in rome on march <num> and was allowed to enter the conclave
he stayed there two weeks freely debating with the electors
fortunately he did not press them but only expressed the wish for the election of a pope who would be able to carry out his duties with the proper respect for the secular rulers
cardinal de bernis entered the conclave at the end of march and took the leadership of the anti @-@ jesuit faction from the hands of cardinal orsini who could have blocked zelanti ’ s actions only with the great difficulties
bernis immediately established a regular correspondence with french ambassador marquis d 'aubeterre which was in violation of the fundamental law of the conclave
ambassadors of france and spain urged bernis to insist that the election of the future pope be made to depend on his written engagement to suppress the jesuits
bernis refused answering that demanding from the future pope a written or oral promise to destroy the society of jesus would be in violation of the canon law
in spite of this refusal during the next few weeks bernis consecutively rejected all candidates proposed by zelanti as too devoted to the jesuits
in this way twenty @-@ three out of twenty @-@ eight papabile were eliminated among them strongly pro @-@ jesuit cardinal fantuzzi who at some point was very close to achieving election to the papal throne as well as cavalchini colonna stoppani pozzobonelli sersale and several others
the arrival of spanish cardinals solis and de la cerda on april <num> strengthened the anti @-@ jesuit party
they also violated the law of the conclave by establishing regular correspondence with spanish ambassador azpuru
the spaniards had fewer scruples than bernis and supported by cardinal malvezzi took the matter into their own hands
they paid attention to the only friar in the sacred college cardinal lorenzo ganganelli o
f
m
conv
the attitude of ganganelli towards the jesuits was a great mystery – he had been educated by the jesuits and it was said that he received the red hat at the instance of father lorenzo ricci general of the society of jesus but during the pontificate of clement xiii he did not engage himself in the defence of the order
cardinal solis began by sounding him out as to his willingness to give the promise required by the bourbon princes as an indispensable condition for election
ganganelli answered that he recognized in the sovereign pontiff the right to extinguish with good conscience the society of jesus provided he observed the canon law and that it was desirable that the pope should do everything in his power to satisfy the wishes of the crowns
it is not certain whether it was a written or only an oral promise but this declaration fully satisfied the ambassadors
in the same time zelanti also began to incline to give their support to ganganelli looking upon him as indifferent or even favourable to the jesuits
it seems that the attitude of zelanti was decided by the secret negotiations between their leaders alessandro and gian francesco albani and the spanish cardinals
cardinal de bernis the nominal leader of the court faction probably did not play any role in the appointment of ganganelli and only followed the instructions of marquis d 'aubeterre when all had been already known
he took the name of clement xiv in honour of clement xiii who had elevated him to the cardinalate
on may <num> the new pope was consecrated to the episcopate by cardinal federico marcello lante bishop of porto e santa rufina and sub @-@ dean of the sacred college of cardinals assisted by cardinals gian francesco albani bishop of sabina and henry benedict stuart bishop of frascati
on june <num> he was solemnly crowned by cardinal alessandro albani protodeacon of s

although the exact origin of the plague is unknown a young boy from a village in china is identified as the plague 's official patient zero
the boy 's case marks the point where the chinese government begins to take measures to cover up the disease including generating a crisis with taiwan to mask their activities
nevertheless the plague still manages to spread to various nations by human trafficking refugees and the black market organ trade
initially these nations were able to cover up their smaller outbreaks until a much larger outbreak in south africa brings the plague to public attention

brooks discussed the cultural influences on the novel
he claimed inspiration from the good war an oral history of world war two <year> by studs terkel stating terkel 's book is an oral history of world war ii
i read it when i was a teenager and it 's sat with me ever since
when i sat down to write world war z an oral history of the zombie war i wanted it to be in the vein of an oral history
brooks also cited renowned zombie film director george a
romero as an influence and criticized the return of the living dead films they cheapen zombies make them silly and campy
they 've done for the living dead what the old batman tv show did for the dark knight
brooks acknowledged making several references to popular culture in the novel including one to alien robot franchise transformers but declined to identify the others so that readers could discover them independently
brooks conducted copious research while writing world war z
the technology politics economics culture and military tactics were based on a variety of reference books and consultations with expert sources
brooks also cites the u
s
army as a reference on firearm statistics
at one point in the book a palestinian refugee living in kuwait refuses to believe the dead are rising fearing it is a trick by israel
many american characters blame the united states inability to counter the zombie threat on low confidence in their government due to conflicts in the middle east
brooks shows his particular dislike of government bureaucracy
for example one character in the novel tries to justify lying about the zombie outbreak to avoid widespread panic while at the same time failing to develop a solution for fear of arousing public ire
several interviews especially those from the united states focus on policy changes designed to train the surviving americans to fight the zombies and rebuild the country
for example when cities were made to be as efficient as possible in order to fight the zombies the plumber could hold a higher status than the former c
e
o
when the ultra @-@ rich hid in their homes which had been turned into fortified compounds they were overwhelmed by others trying to get in leading to mass slaughter
throughout the novel characters demonstrate the physical and mental requirements needed to survive a disaster
brooks described the large amount of research needed to find optimal methods for fighting a worldwide zombie outbreak
he also pointed out that americans like the zombie genre because they believe they can survive anything with the right tools and talent
he believes that zombies allow people to deal with their own anxiety about the end of the world
brooks has expressed a deep fear of zombies this mindlessness is connected to the context in which brooks was writing
he declared at this point we 're pretty much living in an irrational time full of human suffering and lacking reason or logic
gilbert cruz of entertainment weekly gave the novel an a rating commenting that the novel shared with great zombie stories the use of a central metaphor describing it as an addictively readable oral history
steven h
silver identified brooks international focus as the novel 's greatest strength and commented favorably on brooks ability to create an appreciation for the work needed to combat a global zombie outbreak
silver 's only complaint was with good @-@ byes — the final chapter — in which characters get a chance to give a final closing statement
silver felt that it was not always apparent who the sundry undifferentiated characters were
the eagle described the book as being unlike any other zombie tale as it is sufficiently terrifying for most readers and not always in a blood @-@ and @-@ guts way either
keith phipps of the a
v
club stated that the format of the novel makes it difficult for it to develop momentum but found the novel 's individual episodes gripping
patrick daily of the chicago reader said the novel transcends the silliness of the zombie survival guide by touching on deeper more somber aspects of the human condition
in his review for time out chicago pete coco declared that b ending horror to the form of alternative history would have been novel in and of itself
doing so in the mode of studs terkel might constitute brilliance
ron currie jr
named world war z one of his favorite apocalyptic novels and praised brooks for illustrating the tacit agreement between writer and reader that is essential to the success of stories about the end of the world
both agree to pretend that this is not fiction that in fact the horrific tales of a war between humans and zombies are based in reality
drew taylor of the fairfield county weekly credited world war z with making zombies more popular in mainstream society
the hardcover version of world war z spent four weeks on the new york times best seller list peaking at number nine
by november <year> according to publishers weekly world war z had sold one million copies in all formats
the book is read by brooks but includes other actors taking on the roles of the many individual characters who are interviewed in the novel
brooks previous career in voice acting and voice @-@ over work meant he could recommend a large number of the cast members
on may <num> <year> random house audio released a lengthier audiobook titled world war z the complete edition movie tie @-@ in edition an oral history of the zombie war
it contains the entirety of the original abridged audiobook as well as new recordings of each missing segment
a separate additional audiobook containing only the new recordings not found in the original audiobook was released simultaneously as world war z the lost files a companion to the abridged edition
carroll had mixed opinions on the voice acting commending it as solid and understated mercifully free of special effects and scenery chewing overall but lamenting what she perceived as undue cheeriness on the part of max brooks and inauthenticity in steve park 's chinese accent
publishers weekly also criticized brooks narration but found that the rest of the all @-@ star cast deliver their parts with such fervor and intensity that listeners cannot help but empathize with these characters
in an article in slate concerning the mistakes producers make on publishing audiobooks nate dimeo used world war z as an example of dramatizations whose full casts contributed to making them great listens and described the book as a smarter @-@ than @-@ it @-@ has @-@ any @-@ right @-@ to @-@ be zombie novel
the world war z audiobook won the <year> audie award for multi @-@ voiced performance and was nominated for audiobook of the year
the screenplay was written by j
michael straczynski with marc forster directing and pitt starring as the main character un employee gerry lane
despite being the draft that got the film green @-@ lit straczynski 's script was tossed aside so that production which was to begin at the start of <year> was delayed while the script was completely re @-@ written by matthew michael carnahan to set the film in the present leaving behind much of the book 's premise to make it more of an action film
in a <year> interview brooks claimed the film now had nothing in common with the novel other than the title
filming commenced mid @-@ <year> and the film was released in june <year>
it is a matter of typographical convention
since the introduction of movable @-@ type printing in europe various sentence spacing conventions have been used in languages with a latin alphabet
these include a normal word space as between the words in a sentence a single enlarged space and two full spaces
until the <num> century publishing houses and printers in many countries used additional space between sentences
there were exceptions to this traditional spacing method — some printers used spacing between sentences that was no wider than word spacing
this was french spacing — a term synonymous with single @-@ space sentence spacing until the late <num> century
with the introduction of the typewriter in the late <num> century typists used two spaces between sentences to mimic the style used by traditional typesetters
while wide sentence spacing was phased out in the printing industry in the mid @-@ twentieth century the practice continued on typewriters and later on computers
perhaps because of this many modern sources now incorrectly claim that wide spacing was created for the typewriter
the desired or correct sentence spacing is often debated but many sources now say additional space is not necessary or desirable
from around <year> single sentence spacing became standard in books magazines and newspapers and the majority of style guides that use a latin @-@ derived alphabet as a language base now prescribe or recommend the use of a single space after the concluding punctuation of a sentence
however some sources still state that additional spacing is correct or acceptable
the debate continues on the world wide web
many people prefer double sentence spacing for informal use because that was how they were taught to type
there is a debate on which convention is more readable the few recent direct studies conducted since <year> have produced inconclusive results
early american english and other european typesetters style guides also known as printers rules specified spacing standards that were all essentially identical from the <num> century onwards
these guides — e
g
jacobi in the uk <year> and mackellar harpel and de vinne <year> – <year> in the u
s
— indicated that sentences should be em @-@ spaced and that words should be <num> <num> or <num> <num> em @-@ spaced illustration right
the relative size of the sentence spacing would vary depending on the size of the word spaces and the justification needs
for most countries this remained the standard for published work until the <num> century
yet even in this period there were publishing houses notably in france that used a standard word space between sentences — a technique called french spacing illustration below
just as these machines revolutionized the mass production of text the advent of the typewriter around the same time revolutionized the creation of personal and business documents
but the typewriters mechanical limitations did not allow variable spacing — typists could only choose the number of times they pressed the space bar
typists in some english @-@ speaking countries initially learned to insert three spaces between sentences to approximate the wider sentence spacing used in traditional printing but later settled on two spaces a practice that continued throughout the <num> century
this became known as english spacing and marked a divergence from french typists who continued to use french spacing
this standard continued in use to some extent into the <num>
magazines newspapers and books began to adopt the single space convention in the united states in the <num> and in the united kingdom in the <num>
typists did not move to single spacing simultaneously
the average writer still relied on the typewriter to create text — with its inherent mechanical spacing limitations
technological advances began affecting sentence spacing methods
in <year> ibm introduced the executive a typewriter capable of proportional spacing — which had been used in professional typesetting for hundreds of years
this innovation broke the hold that the monospaced font had on the typewriter — reducing the severity of its mechanical limitations
by the <num> electronic phototypesetting systems ignored runs of white space in text
this was also true of the world wide web as html normally ignores additional spacing although in <year> the css <num>
<num> standard officially added an option that can preserve additional spaces
in the <num> desktop publishing software provided the average writer with more advanced formatting tools
by the late <num> century literature on the written word had begun to adjust its guidance on sentence spacing
in <year> geoffrey dowding 's book finer points in the spacing and arrangement of type underscored the widespread shift from a single enlarged em space to a standard word space between sentences
with the advent of the computer age typographers began deprecating double spacing even in monospaced text
in <year> desktop publishing by design stated that typesetting requires only one space after periods question marks exclamation points and colons and identified single sentence spacing as a typographic convention
stop stealing sheep find out how type works <year> and designing with type the essential guide to typography <year> both indicate that uniform spacing should be used between words including between sentences
more recent works on typography weigh in strongly
ilene strizver founder of the type studio says forget about tolerating differences of opinion typographically speaking typing two spaces before the start of a new sentence is absolutely unequivocally wrong
the complete manual on typography <year> states that the typewriter tradition of separating sentences with two word spaces after a period has no place in typesetting and the single space is standard typographic practice
the elements of typographic style <year> advocates a single space between sentences noting that your typing as well as your typesetting will benefit from unlearning this quaint double spacing victorian habit
david jury 's book about face reviving the rules of typography <year> — published in switzerland — clarifies the contemporary typographic position on sentence spacing word spaces preceding or following punctuation should be optically adjusted to appear to be of the same value as a standard word space
if a standard word space is inserted after a full point or a comma then optically this produces a space of up to <num> wider than that of other word spaces within a line of type
this is because these punctuation marks carry space above them which when added to the adjacent standard word spaces combines to create a visually larger space
some argue that the additional space after a comma and full point serves as a pause signal for the reader
but this is unnecessary and visually disruptive since the pause signal is provided by the punctuation mark itself
during the <num> century style guides commonly mandated two spaces between sentences for typewritten manuscripts which were used prior to professionally typesetting the work
as computer desktop publishing became commonplace typewritten manuscripts became less relevant and most style guides stopped making distinctions between manuscripts and final typeset products
in the same period style guides began changing their guidance on sentence spacing
the <year> edition of the chicago manual of style used em spaces between sentences in its text by the <year> edition it had changed to single sentence spacing for both manuscript and print
by the <num> the united kingdom 's hart 's rules <year> had shifted to single sentence spacing
other style guides followed suit in the <num>
soon after the beginning of the 21st century the majority of style guides had changed to indicate that only one word space was proper between sentences
modern style guides provide standards and guidance for the written language
these works are important to writers since virtually all professional editors work closely with one of them in editing a manuscript for publication
late editions of comprehensive style guides such as the oxford style manual <year> in the united kingdom and the chicago manual of style <year> in the united states provide standards for a wide variety of writing and design topics including sentence spacing
the majority of style guides now prescribe the use of a single space after terminal punctuation in final written works and publications
a few style guides allow double sentence spacing for draft work and the gregg reference manual makes room for double and single sentence spacing based on author preferences
web design guides do not usually provide guidance on this topic as html refuses to recognize double spaces altogether
these works themselves follow the current publication standard of single sentence spacing
the european union 's interinstitutional style guide <year> indicates that single sentence spacing is to be used in all european union publications — encompassing <num> languages
for the english language the european commission 's english style guide <year> states that sentences are always single @-@ spaced
the style manual for authors editors and printers <year> first published in <year> by the commonwealth government printing office of australia stipulates that only one space is used after sentence @-@ closing punctuation and that programs for word processing and desktop publishing offer more sophisticated variable spacing so this practice of double spacing is now avoided because it can create distracting gaps on a page
national languages not covered by an authoritative language academy typically have multiple style guides — only some of which may discuss sentence spacing
this is the case in the united kingdom
the oxford style manual <year> and the modern humanities research association 's mhra style guide <year> state that only single spacing should be used
in canada both the english and french language sections of the canadian style a guide to writing and editing <year> prescribe single sentence spacing
in the united states many style guides — such as the chicago manual of style <year> — allow only single sentence spacing
the most important style guide in italy il nuovo manuale di stile <year> does not address sentence spacing but the guida di stile italiano <year> the official guide for microsoft translation tells users to use single sentence spacing instead of the double spacing used in the united states
their publications typically address orthography and grammar as opposed to matters of typography
style guides are less relevant for such languages as their academies set prescriptive rules
for example the académie française publishes the dictionnaire de l 'académie française for french speakers worldwide
the <year> edition does not provide guidance on sentence spacing but is single @-@ sentence @-@ spaced throughout — consistent with historical french spacing
the spanish language is similar
the most important body within the association of spanish language academies the real academia española publishes the diccionario de la lengua española which is viewed as prescriptive for the spanish language worldwide
the <year> edition does not provide sentence spacing guidance but is itself single sentence spaced
the german language manual empfehlungen des rats für deutsche rechtschreibung recommendations of the council for german orthography <year> does not address sentence spacing
the manual itself uses one space after terminal punctuation
additionally the duden the german language dictionary most commonly used in germany indicates that double sentence spacing is an error
most do not
grammar guides typically cover terminal punctuation and the proper construction of sentences — but not the spacing between sentences
moreover many modern grammar guides are designed for quick reference and refer users to comprehensive style guides for additional matters of writing style
for example the pocket idiot 's guide to grammar and punctuation <year> points users to style guides such as the mla style manual for consistency in formatting work and for all other editorial concerns
the grammar bible <year> states that the modern system of english punctuation is by no means simple
a book that covers all the bases would need to be of considerable breadth and weight and anyone interested in such a resource is advised to consult the chicago manual of style
some systems accept whatever the user types while others attempt to alter the spacing or use the user input as a method of detecting sentences
computer @-@ based word processors and typesetting software such as troff and tex allow users to arrange text in a manner previously only available to professional typesetters
the text editing environment in emacs uses a double space following a period to identify the end of sentences unambiguously the double space convention prevents confusion with periods within sentences that signify abbreviations
how emacs recognizes the end of a sentence is controlled by the settings sentence @-@ end @-@ double @-@ space and sentence @-@ end
the vi editor also follows this convention thus it is relatively easy to manipulate jump over copy delete whole sentences in both emacs and vi
the unix typesetter program troff uses two spaces to mark the end of a sentence
this allows the typesetter to distinguish sentence endings from abbreviations and to typeset them differently
early versions of troff which only typeset in fixed width fonts would automatically add a second space between sentences which were detected based on the combination of terminal punctuation and a line feed
microsoft word does not treat sentences differently by default but the grammar checking can be set to prefer a specific number of spaces between sentences
on some modern touch @-@ screen platforms including android and ios typing two spaces in a row is automatically interpreted to mean the end of a sentence and a period is automatically inserted
however only one space is retained
multiple spaces are eliminated by default in most world wide web content regardless of whether they are associated with sentences or not
there are options for preserving spacing such as the css white @-@ space property and the pre tag
twitter retains extra spaces in user input on their website
html also includes several other space entities which are not collapsed such as an em space an en space and a non @-@ breaking space
some unicode space characters are also not collapsed on the web
in all my years of writing about type it 's still the question i hear most often and a search of the web will find threads galore on the subject
this subject is still widely debated today
many people are opposed to single sentence spacing for various reasons
some state that the habit of double spacing is too deeply ingrained to change
others claim that additional space between sentences improves the aesthetics or readability of text
proponents of double sentence spacing also state that some publishers may still require double @-@ spaced manuscript submissions from authors
a key example noted is the screenwriting industry 's monospaced standard for screenplay manuscripts courier <num> @-@ point font although some works on screenwriting indicate that courier is merely preferred – proportional fonts may be used
some reliable sources state simply that writers should follow their particular style guide but proponents of double spacing caution that publishers guidance takes precedence including those that ask for double sentence spaced manuscripts
one of the most popular arguments against wider sentence spacing is that it was created for monospaced fonts of the typewriter and is no longer needed with modern proportional fonts
however proportional fonts existed together with wide sentence spacing for centuries before the typewriter and remained for decades after its invention
when the typewriter was first introduced typists were most commonly taught to use three spaces between sentences
this gradually shifted to two spaces while the print industry remained unchanged in its wide em @-@ spaced sentences
some sources now state it is acceptable for monospaced fonts to be single spaced today although other references continue to specify double spacing for monospaced fonts
the double space typewriter convention has been taught in schools in typing classes and that remains the practice in many cases
some voice concerns that students will later be forced to relearn how to type
most style guides indicate that single sentence spacing is proper for final or published work today and most publishers require manuscripts to be submitted as they will appear in publication — single sentence spaced
writing sources typically recommend that prospective authors remove extra spaces before submitting manuscripts although other sources state that publishers will use software to remove the spaces before final publication
supporters of single spacing assert that familiarity with the current standard in books magazines and the web enhances readability that double spacing looks strange in text using proportional fonts and that the rivers and holes caused by double spacing impair readability
proponents of double sentence spacing state that the extra space between sentences enhances readability by providing clearer breaks between sentences and making text appear more legible particularly noting the very small visual difference between a dot and a comma
however typographic opinions are typically anecdotal with no basis in evidence
opinions are not always safe guides to legibility of print and when direct studies are conducted anecdotal opinions — even those of experts — can turn out to be false
text that seems legible visually pleasing at first glance may be shown to actually impair reading effectiveness when subjected to scientific study
the <year> study tested participants reading speed for single and double sentence spaced passages of on @-@ screen text
the authors stated that the double space group consistently took longer time to finish than the single space group but concluded that there was not enough evidence to suggest that a significant difference exists
the <year> and <year> studies analyzed on @-@ screen single double and triple spacing
in both cases the authors stated that there was insufficient evidence to draw a conclusion
ni branch chen and clinton conducted a similar study in <year> using identical spacing variables
the authors concluded that the results provided insufficient evidence that time and comprehension differ significantly among different conditions of spacing between sentences
the story was serialised weekly in le soir jeunesse the children 's supplement to le soir belgium 's leading francophone newspaper from october <year> to october <year> amidst the german occupation of belgium during world war ii
partway through serialisation le soir jeunesse was cancelled and the story began to be serialised daily in the pages of le soir
the story tells of young belgian reporter tintin and his dog snowy who travel to morocco to pursue a gang of international opium smugglers
the crab with the golden claws was published in book form shortly after its conclusion
hergé continued the adventures of tintin with the shooting star while the series itself became a defining part of the franco @-@ belgian comics tradition
in <year> hergé coloured and redrew the book in his distinctive ligne @-@ claire style for casterman 's republication
the crab with the golden claws introduces the recurring character captain haddock who became a major fixture of the series
the book is the first tintin adventure published in the united states and the first to be adapted into a motion picture
the crab with the golden claws was adapted for the <year> belvision studios animation hergé 's adventures of tintin for the <year> ellipse nelvana animated series the adventures of tintin and for the <year> film directed by steven spielberg
his subsequent investigation and the kidnapping of a japanese man interested in giving him a letter leads tintin to a ship called the karaboudjan where he is abducted by a syndicate of criminals who have hidden opium in the crab tins
tintin escapes from his locked room after snowy chews through his bonds and tintin knocks out a man sent to bring him food leaving the man bound and gagged in the room
tintin encounters captain haddock an alcoholic sea captain who is manipulated by his first mate allan and is unaware of his crew 's criminal activities
tintin hides in the locker under the bed and defeats jumbo the sailor left in the cabin while allan thinks tintin has climbed out of the porthole back into the storeroom
he blows open the storeroom door then finding it empty goes back to the captain 's room where he finds jumbo tied to a chair and gagged
escaping the ship in a lifeboat after sending a radio message to the police about the cargo a seaplane tries to attack them
tintin and the captain hijack the plane tie up the pilots and try to reach spain
haddock 's drunken behaviour in a storm causes them to crash @-@ land in the sahara where the crew escapes
after trekking across the desert and nearly dying of dehydration tintin and haddock are rescued and taken to a french outpost where they hear on the radio the storm sunk the karaboudjan
they travel to a moroccan port and along the way are attacked by tuareg tribesmen defending themselves with french mas @-@ <num> rifles
at the port members of his old crew kidnap the captain after he recognises their disguised karaboudjan
tintin meets thomson and thompson who got his message and they learn that the wealthy merchant omar ben salaad sold the crab tins tintin tells thomson and thompson to discreetly investigate
tintin tracks down the gang and saves the captain but they both become intoxicated by the fumes from wine barrels breached in a shootout with the villains
haddock chases a gang @-@ member from the cellar to an entrance behind a bookcase in salaad 's house
upon sobering up tintin discovers a necklace of a crab with golden claws on the now @-@ subdued owner of the wine cellar omar ben salaad and realizes that he is the leader of the drug cartel
allan steals a boat and tries escaping but tintin captures him
the police arrest the gang and free the japanese man who introduces himself as bunji kuraki a police detective who was trying to warn tintin of the group he was up against
he had been investigating the sailor on haddock 's crew who drowned the sailor was on the verge of bringing him opium before he was eliminated
turning on the radio tintin learns that thanks to him the entire organisation of the crab with the golden claws is behind bars
on <num> may belgian king leopold iii officially surrendered the country to the german army to prevent further killing a move that hergé agreed with
germany placed belgium under occupation
hergé followed the king 's request that all civilians who had fled the country return he arrived back in brussels on <num> june
there he found that an officer of the german army 's propagandastaffel occupied his house and he also faced financial trouble as he owed back taxes yet was unable to access his financial reserves his fee due from casterman eventually arrived
all belgian publications were now under the control of the german occupying force
the catholic publication le vingtième siècle and its supplement le petit vingtième where hergé had always worked serialising the adventures of tintin no longer had permission to continue publication
land of black gold the story that hergé had been serialising there had to be abandoned
victor matthys the rexist editor of le pays réel offered hergé employment as a cartoonist but hergé perceived le pays réel as an explicitly political publication and thus declined the position
instead he accepted a position with le soir belgium 's largest francophone daily newspaper
confiscated from its original owners the german authorities permitted le soir to reopen under the directorship of belgian editor raymond de becker although it remained firmly under nazi control supporting the german war effort and espousing anti @-@ semitism
after joining le soir on <num> october hergé created its new children 's supplement le soir jeunesse
appointed editor of this supplement he was aided by old friend paul jamin and the cartoonist jacques van melkebeke
the first issue of le soir jeunesse was published with a large announcement across the cover tintin et milou sont revenus tintin and snowy are back
some belgians were upset that hergé was willing to work for a newspaper controlled by the occupying nazi administration he received an anonymous letter from the father of a large family asking him not to work for le soir fearing that the adventures of tintin would now be used to indoctrinate children in nazi ideology and that as a result they will no longer speak of god of the christian family of the catholic ideal
how can you agree to collaborate in this terrible act a real sin against spirit hergé however was heavily enticed by the size of le soir 's readership which reached <num> @,@ <num> far more than what le vingtième siècle had been able to accomplish
faced with the reality of nazi oversight hergé abandoned the overt political themes that had pervaded much of his earlier work instead adopting a policy of neutrality
without the need to satirise political types harry thompson observed that hergé was now concentrating more on plot and on developing a new style of character comedy
the public reacted positively
however on <num> may <year> a paper shortage caused by the ongoing war led to the le soir jeunesse being reduced to four pages with the length of the weekly tintin strip being cut by two @-@ thirds
several weeks later on <num> september <year> the supplement disappeared altogether with the crab with the golden claws being moved into le soir itself in september where it became a daily strip
as a result hergé was forced to alter the pace at which his narrative moved as he had to hold the reader 's attention at the end of every line
as with earlier adventures of tintin the story was later serialised in france in the catholic newspaper cœurs vaillants from <num> june <year>
following serialisation casterman collected together and published the story in book form in <year> the last black @-@ and @-@ white tintin volume to be released
for this collected edition hergé thought of renaming the story initially considering the red crab to accompany earlier adventures the blue lotus and the black island before re @-@ settling on le crabe aux pinces d 'or the crab with the golden claws
hergé became annoyed that casterman then sent the book to the printers without his final approval
nevertheless as a result of le soir 's publicity book sales markedly increased to the extent that most of the prior adventures of tintin were reprinted as a result
german authorities made two exceptions no reprinting of tintin in america or the black island because they were set in the united states and britain respectively both of which were in conflict with germany
the serial introduced the character of captain haddock
haddock made his first appearance in le soir adjacent to an advert for the anti @-@ semitic german film jud süß
hergé chose the name haddock for the character after his wife germaine remi mentioned a sad english fish during a meal
the inclusion of the japanese police detective bunji kuraki as an ally of tintin 's in this story was probably designed to counterbalance hergé 's portrayal of the japanese as the antagonists in his earlier story the blue lotus particularly given that the occupying government was allied with japan at the time
the use of morocco as a setting was likely influenced by the white squadron by french writer joseph peyré which hergé had read and seen the film in <year>
the depiction of the french foreign legion in north africa was possibly influenced by p
c
wren 's novel beau geste <year> or its cinematic adaptations in <year> <year> and <year>
whereas hergé 's use of chinese in the blue lotus was correct the arabic script employed in the crab with the golden claws was intentionally fictitious
many of the place names featured in the series are puns the town of kefheir was a pun on the french que faire what is to be done while the port of bagghar derives from the french baggare scrape or fight
the name of omar ben salaad is a pun meaning lobster salad in french
in february <year> casterman suggested to hergé that his books be published in a new format <num> @-@ pages rather than the former <num> to <num> pages and now in full colour rather than black @-@ and @-@ white
he agreed to this and in <year> the crab with the golden claws was re @-@ edited and coloured for publication as an album in <year>
due to the changes in how the adventure had been serialised at le soir the album at this juncture was only <num> pages long and thus hergé filled the missing pages with four full @-@ page colour frames thus bringing it up to the standard <num> @-@ page format
in the <num> the crab with the golden claws along with king ottokar 's sceptre became the first tintin adventures published in the united states in little golden books
however casterman working with the american publisher western publishing made a number of changes jumbo the sailor who tintin leaves bound and gagged in captain haddock 's cabin as well as another man who beats haddock in the cellar could not be black africans as depicted in the original these were changed to a white sailor and an arab due to the american publisher 's concerns depicting blacks and whites mixing together
the accompanying text was not changed however and haddock still refers to the man who beat him as a negro
also by request of the americans scenes of haddock drinking directly from bottles of whiskey on the lifeboat and the plane were blanked out keeping only the text
the edited albums later had their blanked areas redrawn by hergé to be more acceptable and they appear this way in published editions around the world
casterman republished the original black @-@ and @-@ white version of the story in <year> as part of the fourth volume in their archives hergé collection
in <year> they then published a facsimile version of that first edition
elsewhere he asserts that it is haddock 's appearance which makes this book so memorable and that he is tempted to define the book by that character 's début
fellow biographer pierre assouline commented that the crab with the golden claws had a certain charm stemming from its use of exoticism and colonial nostalgia for the french especially evoking their holdings in north africa
michael farr asserted that the arrival of haddock was the most remarkable element of the story offering the series tremendous new potential
he also thought that the dream sequences reflected the popularity of surrealism at the time and that the influence of cinema in particular the films of alfred hitchcock is apparent in the story
jean @-@ marc lofficier and randy lofficier described the story as a thinly @-@ disguised remake of cigars of the pharaoh an adventure of tintin which had been first serialised in <year>
both feature the smuggling of opium in crab tins and cigars respectively and desert treks hostile tribes and at the end the infiltrating of a secret underground lair
they also opined that artistically the story represented a turning point in hergé 's career because he had to switch to a daily format in le soir although as a result of this they felt that the final third of the story seems rushed
stating that the inclusion of a japanese detective investigating drug smuggling in the mediterranean makes no sense within the context of <num> europe they ultimately awarded the story three out of five stars
literary critic jean @-@ marie apostolidès of stanford university in a psychoanalytical review of the crab with the golden claws commented that this book witnessed tintin 's real entrance into the community of human beings as he gains an older brother in haddock
he also believed that the recurring image of alcohol throughout the story was symbolic of sexuality
in particular he believed that there was a strong homoerotic subtext between haddock and tintin represented in the two delirious sequences in one haddock envisions tintin as a champagne bottle frothing at the top thereby symbolising an ejaculating penis while in the other tintin dreams that he is trapped inside a bottle with haddock about to stick a corkscrew into him thereby symbolising sexual penetration
however apostolidès notes in both instances the pair are prevented from realising their sexual fantasies
literary critic tom mccarthy concurred with apostolidès on this point also highlighting what he perceived as homoerotic undertones to these two scenes
he also noted that in this adventure the manner in which a chance finding of a tin can on a belgian street leads tintin into the story is representative of the recurring theme of tintin the detective found throughout the series
it was first shown at the abc cinema on <num> january <year> for a group of invited guests
it was screened publicly only once on <num> december of that year before bouchery declared bankruptcy and fled to argentina
in <year> the animation company belvision studios produced a string of colour adaptations based upon hergé 's original comics adapting eight of the adventures into a series of daily five @-@ minute episodes
the crab with the golden claws was the fifth such story to be adapted being directed by ray goossens and written by greg himself a well @-@ known cartoonist who in later years would become editor @-@ in @-@ chief of tintin magazine
in <year> a second animated series based upon the adventures of tintin was produced this time as a collaboration between the french studio ellipse and the canadian animation company nelvana
adapting <num> of the stories into a series of episodes each <num> minutes long with most stories spanning two episodes the crab with the golden claws was the seventh story produced in the series
directed by stéphane bernasconi critics have praised the series for being generally faithful with compositions having been actually directly taken from the panels in the original comic book
a motion capture adventure film titled the adventures of tintin the secret of the unicorn directed by steven spielberg and produced by peter jackson was released in the us on <num> december <year> and in europe at the end of october <year>
parts of the movie are taken from the crab with the golden claws including the meeting and first adventures of tintin and captain haddock the karaboudjan the flight to bagghar and the crab cans although the plot involving the smuggled opium was not adapted
a video @-@ game tie @-@ in to the movie was released october <year>

chess players and theorists generally agree that white begins the game with some advantage
since <year> compiled statistics support this view white consistently wins slightly more often than black usually scoring between <num> and <num> percent
white 's winning percentage is about the same for tournament games between humans and games between computers
however white 's advantage is less significant in blitz games and games between novices
chess players and theoreticians have long debated whether given perfect play by both sides the game should end in a win for white or a draw
since approximately <year> when world champion wilhelm steinitz addressed this issue the overwhelming consensus has been that a perfectly played game would end in a draw
however a few notable players have argued that white 's advantage may be sufficient to force a win weaver adams and vsevolod rauzer claimed that white is winning after the first move <num>
e4 while hans berliner argued that <num>
d4 may win for white
some players including world champions such as josé raúl capablanca emanuel lasker and bobby fischer have expressed fears of a draw death as chess becomes more deeply analyzed
to alleviate this danger capablanca and fischer both proposed chess variants to renew interest in the game while lasker suggested changing how draws and stalemate are scored
since <year> chess theorists have challenged previously well @-@ established views about white 's advantage
grandmaster gm andrás adorján wrote a series of books on the theme that black is ok arguing that the general perception that white has an advantage is founded more in psychology than reality
gm mihai suba and others contend that sometimes white 's initiative disappears for no apparent reason as a game progresses
the prevalent style of play for black today is to seek dynamic unbalanced positions with active counterplay rather than merely trying to equalize
modern writers also argue that black has certain countervailing advantages
the consensus that white should try to win can be a psychological burden for the white player who sometimes loses by trying too hard to win
some symmetrical openings i
e
those where both players make the same moves can lead to situations where moving first is a disadvantage either for psychological or objective reasons
f
streeter examined the results of <num> @,@ <num> games played in <num> international chess tournaments between <year> and <year>
streeter found that overall white scored <num>

streeter concluded it thus appears that it is becoming increasingly difficult to win with black but somewhat easier to draw
two decades later statistician arthur m
stevens concluded in the blue book of charts to winning chess based on a survey of <num> @,@ <num> master games that he completed in <year> that white scores <num>
<num>
however stevens assembled his games from those that had been published in chess magazines rather than complete collections of all the games played in particular events
more recent sources indicate that white scores approximately <num> to <num> percent

<num> score in <num> @,@ <num> games
statistician jeff sonas in examining data from <num> @,@ <num> games played between <year> and <year> concluded that white scored <num>
<year> plus <num>
<num> times white 's elo rating advantage treating white 's rating advantage as <num> if it is better than <num> or − <num> if it is worse than − <num>
he found that white 's advantage is equivalent to <num> rating points i
e
if white has a rating <num> points below black 's each player will have an expected score of <num>
sonas also found that white 's advantage is smaller <num> in rapid games than in games at a slower classical time control
in the <num> games played at the <year> world blitz chess championship white scored only <num>
<num> w38
<num> d26
<num> l <num>
<num>
other writers conclude that there is a positive correlation between the players ratings and white 's score
according to gm evgeny sveshnikov statistics show that white has no advantage over black in games between beginners but if the players are stronger white has the lead
an analysis of the results of games in chessbase 's mega <year> database between players with similar elo ratings commissioned by gm andrás adorján showed that as the players ratings went up the percentage of draws increased the proportion of decisive games that white won increased and white 's overall winning percentage increased
for example taking the highest and lowest of adorján 's rating categories of <year> games played by the highest @-@ rated players elo ratings <num> and above white scored <num>
<num> overall w26
<num> d58

this is consistent with the traditional view that white by virtue of the first move begins with the initiative and should try to extend it into the middlegame while black should strive to neutralize white 's initiative and attain equality
because white begins with the initiative a minor mistake by white generally leads only to loss of the initiative while a similar mistake by black may have more serious consequences
thus sveshnikov wrote in <year> black players cannot afford to make even the slightest mistake
from a theoretical point of view the tasks of white and black in chess are different white has to strive for a win black — for a draw chess theorists have long debated how enduring white 's initiative is and whether if both sides play perfectly the game should end in a win for white or a draw
george walker wrote in <year> that the first move is an advantage
but if properly answered the first move is of little worth
steinitz the first world champion who is widely considered the father of modern chess wrote in <year> it is now conceded by all experts that by proper play on both sides the legitimate issue of a game ought to be a draw
lasker and capablanca the second and third world champions agreed
reuben fine one of the world 's leading players from <year> to <year> wrote that white 's opening advantage is too intangible to be sufficient for a win without an error by black
the view that a game of chess should end in a draw given best play prevails
even if it cannot be proved this assumption is considered safe by rowson and logical by adorján
watson agrees that the proper result of a perfectly played chess game
is a draw
of course i can 't prove this but i doubt that you can find a single strong player who would disagree
i remember kasparov after a last @-@ round draw explaining to the waiting reporters well chess is a draw
world champion bobby fischer thought that was almost definitely so
lasker and capablanca both worried that chess would suffer a draw death as top @-@ level players drew more and more of their games
more recently fischer agreed saying that the game has become played out
all three advocated changing the rules of chess to minimize the number of drawn games
lasker suggested scoring less than half a point for a draw and more than half a point for stalemating the opponent 's king
capablanca in the <num> proposed capablanca chess a chess variant played on a larger board and with additional pieces
fischer advocated fischer random chess another chess variant in which the initial position of the pieces is determined at random
today some of the sharpest opening variations have been analyzed so deeply that they are often used as drawing weapons
for example at the highest levels black often uses the marshall attack in the ruy lopez a line where black sacrifices a pawn for strong attacking chances to obtain an endgame where black is still a pawn down but is able to draw with correct play
in <year> gms kiril georgiev and atanas kolev asserted that much the same was true of the so @-@ called poisoned pawn variation of the najdorf sicilian which arises after <num>
e4 c5 <num>
nf3 d6 <num>
d4 cxd4 <num>
nxd4 nf6 <num>
nc3 a6 <num>
bg5 e6 <num>
f4 qb6 this has long been considered one of the sharpest and most problematic or even foolhardy opening lines
the game usually continues <num>
qd2 qxb2 <num>
rb1 qa3
georgiev and kolev stated that <num>
bg5 is seldom seen at the highest level because the main line of this variation leads with best play to a draw by perpetual check

however georgiev and kolev 's pessimistic assessment of <num>
bg5 has since been called into question as white succeeded with <num>
e5 another critical line in several later high @-@ level games
gm zaven andriasyan wrote in <year> that after <num>
f5 a forced draw results but that after <num>
e5 we reach a very sharp position with mutual chances
weaver adams then one of the leading american masters was the best @-@ known proponent of this view which he introduced in his <year> book white to play and win and continued to expound in later books and articles until shortly before his death in <year>
adams opined that <num>
e4 was white 's strongest move and that if both sides played the best moves thereafter white ought to win
adams claim was widely ridiculed and he did not succeed in demonstrating the validity of his theory in tournament and match practice
the year after his book was published at the finals of the <year> u
s
open tournament he scored only one draw in his four games as white but won all four of his games as black
adams also lost a match to im i
a
horowitz who took the black pieces in every game
according to sveshnikov vsevolod rauzer a leading soviet player and theoretician during the <num> likewise claimed in the <num> <num>
e4 — and white wins and he managed to prove it quite often
d4 gives white a large and possibly decisive advantage
berliner asserted that with best play white wins against the grünfeld defense the modern benoni the benko gambit and other unnamed major defences and achieves at least a large advantage in many lines of the queen 's gambit declined
however he allowed that it is possible that the rules of chess are such that only some number of plausible @-@ appearing defences to <num>
d4 can be refuted
berliner wrote that adams theories though looked upon with scorn by most top chess players made an immediate and lasting impression on me
weaver w
adams was the first person i met who actually had theories about how chess should be played
berliner 's thesis like adams has been sharply criticized
apart from berliner they have rejected the idea that white has a forced win from the opening position
many also reject the traditional paradigm that black 's objective should be to neutralize white 's initiative and obtain equality
kaufman writes i don 't believe that white has a forced win in chess
i do however believe that with either <num>
e4 or <num>
d4 white should be able to obtain some sort of advantage that persists into the endgame
if chess were scored like boxing with drawn games awarded by some point system to the player if any who came closer to winning then i believe white would indeed have a forced win in theory
he writes in my opinion the only obvious advantage for white is that if he or she plays for a draw and does so well then black can hardly avoid this without taking obvious risks
adorján goes so far as to claim that the tale of white 's advantage is a delusion belief in it is based on mass psychosis
rowson writes that adorján 's contention is one of the most important chess ideas of the last two decades
because it has shaken our assumption that white begins the game with some advantage and revealed its ideological nature
however rowson rejects adorján 's claim that white has essentially no advantage reasoning that white is better and black is ok need not be mutually exclusive claims
in one of adorján 's books gm lajos portisch opined that at least two @-@ thirds of all tested openings give white an apparent advantage
according to portisch for black the root of the problem is that very few people know which are the openings where black is really ok
those who find these lines have nothing to fear as black is indeed ok but only in those variations rowson considers this an important point noting that <num>
d4 players struggle to get anywhere against main @-@ line slavs and <num>
e4 players find the najdorf and sveshnikov sicilians particularly tough
rowson writes that the idea of black trying to equalize is questionable
i think it has limited application to a few openings rather than being an opening prescription for black in general
evans wrote that after one of his games against fischer fischer confided his secret to me unlike other masters he sought to win with the black pieces from the start
the revelation that black has dynamic chances and need not be satisfied with mere equality was the turning point in his career he said
likewise watson surmised that kasparov when playing black bypasses the question of whether white has an opening advantage by thinking in terms of the concrete nature of the dynamic imbalance on the board and seeking to seize the initiative whenever possible
watson observes that energetic opening play by black may
lead to a position so complex and unclear that to speak of equality is meaningless
sometimes we say dynamically balanced instead of equal to express the view that either player is as likely as the other to emerge from complications with an advantage
this style of opening play has become prevalent in modern chess with world champions fischer and kasparov as its most visible practitioners
modern writers also question the idea that white has an enduring advantage
suba in his influential <year> book dynamic chess strategy rejects the notion that the initiative can always be transformed into an enduring advantage
he contends that sometimes the player with the initiative loses it with no logical explanation and that sometimes you must lose it just like that
if you try to cling to it by forcing the issue your dynamic potential will become exhausted and you won 't be able to face a vigorous counter @-@ attack
rowson and watson concur
watson also observes because of the presumption of white being better the juncture of the game at which black frees his game or neutralizes white 's plans has often been automatically assumed to give him equality even though in dynamic openings the exhaustion of white 's initiative very often means that black has seized it with advantage
second white begins the game with some initiative although rowson regards this as a psychological rather than a positional advantage and whether it leads to a positional advantage depends on the relative skill of the players
third some players are able to use the initiative to play a kind of powerful serve and volley chess in which black is flattened with a mixture of deep preparation and attacking prowess
fourth if white wants to draw it is often not so easy for black to prevent this
this advantage is particularly acute in cases where there is a possible threefold repetition because white can begin the repetition without committing to a draw and black has to decide whether to deviate before he knows whether white is bluffing
rowson cites as an example of the last phenomenon the well @-@ regarded zaitsev variation of the ruy lopez

nf3 or play on with a different move or b play a different and possibly inferior variation by playing something other than <num>
re8
first white 's alleged advantage is also a kind of obligation to play for a win and black can often use this to his advantage
second white 's extra move can be a burden and sometimes white finds himself in a mild form of zugzwang zugzwang lite
third although white begins the game with the initiative if black retains a flexible position with good reactive possibilities this initiative can be absorbed and often passes over to black
fourth the fact that white moves before black often gives black useful information
suba likewise argues that white 's advantage is actually less than a move since white must tip his hand first allowing black to react to white 's plans
suba writes in terms of the mathematical games theory chess is a game of complete information and black 's information is always greater — by one move rowson also notes that black 's chances increase markedly by playing good openings which tend to be those with flexibility and latent potential rather than those that give white fixed targets or that try to take the initiative prematurely
he also emphasizes that white has the initiative not the advantage
success with black depends on seeing beyond the initiative and thinking of positions in terms of potential
these ideas are exemplified by the hedgehog a dynamic modern system against the english opening that can arise from various move orders

white has a spatial advantage while black often maneuvers his pieces on the last two ranks of the board but white has to keep a constant eye on the possible liberating pawn thrusts
b5 and
d5
watson remarks black 's goal is to remain elastic and flexible with many options for his pieces whereas white can become paralyzed at some point by the need to protect against various dynamic pawn breaks
he also observes that white tends to be as much tied up by black 's latent activity as black himself is tied up by white 's space advantage
moreover attempts by white to overrun black 's position often rebound disastrously

evans writes of such openings if a defense is considered good for black it must be even better for white with a move in hand
former world champion mikhail botvinnik reportedly expressed the same view
watson questions this idea citing suba 's thesis that black by moving second has more complete information than white
he writes everyone has such difficulties playing as white against a sicilian defence <num>
e4 c5 but
leading masters have no qualms about answering <num>
c4 with <num>
e5
to explain this paradox watson discusses several different reversed sicilian lines showing how black can exploit the disadvantages of various extra moves for white
he concludes the point is black 's set @-@ up in the sicilian is fine as a reactive system but not worth much when trying to claim the initiative as white
this is true because black is able to react to the specific plan white chooses in suba 's terms his information is indeed a move greater furthermore he is able to take advantage of dead equal positions which white hoping to retain the advantage of the first move would normally avoid
watson also observes similarly the dutch defence looks particularly sterile when white achieves the reversed positions a tempo up it turns out that he has nothing useful to do and indeed many standard black openings are not very inspiring when one gets them as white tempo in hand
gm alex yermolinsky likewise notes that gm vladimir malaniuk a successful exponent of the leningrad dutch <num>
d4 f5 <num>
g3 g6 at the highest levels once made a deep impression on me by casually dismissing someone 's suggestion that he should try <num>
f4 as white
he smiled and said that extra move 's gonna hurt me
yermolinsky also agrees with alekhine 's criticism of <num>
g3 e5 <num>
nf3 a reversed alekhine 's defense in réti – alekhine baden @-@ baden <year> writing that alekhine understood the difference in opening philosophies for white and black and realized they just can 't be the same white is supposed to try for more than just obtaining a comfortable game in reversed colour opening set @-@ ups and as the statistics show — surprisingly for a lot of people but not for me — white doesn 't even score as well as black does in the same positions with his extra tempo and all
howard staunton generally considered to have been the strongest player in the world from <year> to <year> made a similar point over <num> years ago writing that owen 's defense <num>
e4 b6 is playable for black but that <num>
b3 is inferior to the more customary first moves from its being essentially defensive
the current view is that owen 's defense is slightly better for white while <num>
b3 is playable but less likely to yield an opening advantage than <num>
e4 or <num>
d4
watson concludes that a most moves have disadvantages as well as advantages so an extra move is not always an unqualified blessing b with his extra information about what white is doing black can better react to the new situation and c because a draw is likely to be more acceptable to black than to white white is apt to avoid lines that allow drawish simplifications while black may not object to such lines
accordingly watson suba evans and the eminent player and theorist aron nimzowitsch <year> – <year> have all argued that it is in black 's interest to avoid symmetry
nonetheless even symmetrical opening lines sometimes illustrate the tenuous nature of white 's advantage in several respects
it is often difficult for white to prove an advantage in symmetrical opening lines
as gm bent larsen wrote annotating a game that began <num>
c4 c5 <num>
b3 b6 in symmetrical openings white has a theoretical advantage but in many of them it is only theoretical
gm andrew soltis wrote in <year> that he hates playing against the symmetrical petroff 's defense <num>

moreover symmetrical positions may be disadvantageous to white in that he has to commit himself first
watson notes that it is even difficult for white to play noncommittally in a symmetrical position since almost every move has certain drawbacks

d3 d6 reinhard – fischer western open <year> believe it or not black stands better now whatever white does black will vary it and get an asymmetrical position and have the superior position due to his better pawn structure however gm paul keres responded in chess magazine we just don 't believe it in symmetrical positions as the hodgson – arkell and portisch – tal games discussed below illustrate black can continue to imitate white as long as he finds it feasible and desirable to do so and deviate when that ceases to be the case
further a particular extra move is sometimes more of a liability than an asset
for example soltis notes that the exchange french position arising after <num>
e4 e6 <num>
d4 d5 <num>
exd5 exd5 <num>
nf3 nf6 is pretty equal
the same position but with black 's knight moved to e4 arises in petroff 's defense after <num>
e4 e5 <num>
nf3 nf6 <num>
nxe5 d6 <num>
nf3 nxe4 <num>
d4 d5
that position offers white better chances precisely because black 's extra move
ne4 allows the advanced knight to become a target for attack
finally symmetrical positions may be difficult for the white player for psychological reasons
watson writes that anyone who tries the exchange french even if he thinks he is playing for a win assume s a psychological burden
white has already ceded the advantage of the first move and knows it whereas black is challenged to find ways to seize the initiative
two famous examples of white losses in the exchange french are m
gurevich – short and tatai – korchnoi
in m
gurevich – short a game between two of the world 's leading players white needed only a draw to qualify for the candidates matches while black needed to win
gurevich played passively and was outplayed by short who achieved the necessary win qualified for the candidates and ultimately went on to challenge kasparov for the world championship
in tatai – korchnoi the italian im fell victim to korchnoi 's whirlwind mating attack losing in just <num> moves
rowson gives the following example of black outplaying white from the symmetrical variation of the english opening
he remarks there is something compelling about black 's strategy
he seems to be saying i will copy all your good moves and as soon as you make a bad move i won 't copy you any more hodgson – arkell newcastle <year> <num>

in matches the players colors in the first game are determined by drawing lots and alternated thereafter
in round robin tournaments with an odd number of players each player receives an equal number of whites and blacks with an even number of players each receives one extra white or black
where one or more players withdraws from the tournament the tournament director may change the assigned colors in some games so that no player receives two more blacks than whites or vice versa
the double @-@ round robin tournament is considered to give the most reliable final standings since each player receives the same number of whites and blacks and plays both white and black against each opponent
in swiss system tournaments the tournament director tries to ensure that each player receives as nearly as possible the same number of games as white and black and that the player 's color alternates from round to round
after the first round the director may deviate from the otherwise prescribed pairings in order to give as many players as possible their equalizing or due colors
more substantial deviations are permissible to avoid giving a player two more blacks than whites for example three blacks in four games than vice versa since extra whites cause far less player distress than extra blacks which impose a significant handicap on the affected player
tournaments with an even number of rounds cause the most problems since if there is a disparity it is greater e

seven @-@ piece endgames were solved in <year> and released as lomonosov tablebases
jonathan rowson has speculated that in principle it should be possible for a machine to
develop <num> @-@ piece tablebases
this may take decades or even centuries but unless runaway global warming or nuclear war gets in the way i think it will eventually happen
however information theorist claude shannon argued that it is not feasible for any computer to actually do this
in his <year> paper programming a computer for playing chess he writes with chess it is possible in principle to play a perfect game or construct a machine to do so as follows one considers in a given position all possible moves then all moves for the opponent etc
to the end of the game in each variation
the end must occur by the rules of the games after a finite number of moves remembering the <num> move drawing rule
each of these variations ends in win loss or draw
by working backward from the end one can determine whether there is a forced win the position is a draw or is lost
it is easy to show however even with the high computing speed available in electronic calculators this computation is impractical
in typical chess positions there will be of the order of <num> legal moves
the number holds fairly constant until the game is nearly finished as shown
by de groot who averaged the number of legal moves in a large number of master games
thus a move for white and then one for black gives about <num> possibilities
a typical game lasts about <num> moves to resignation of one party
this is conservative for our calculation since the machine would calculate out to checkmate not resignation
however even at this figure there will be <num> variations to be calculated from the initial position
a machine operating at the rate of one variation per microsecond would require over <num> years to calculate the first move it is thus theoretically possible to solve chess determining with certainty whether a perfectly played game should end in a win for white a draw or even a win for black
however according to shannon the time frame required puts this possibility beyond the limits of any feasible technology
hans @-@ joachim bremermann a professor of mathematics and biophysics at the university of california at berkeley further argued in a <year> paper that the speed memory and processing capacity of any possible future computer equipment are limited by certain physical barriers the light barrier the quantum barrier and the thermodynamical barrier
these limitations imply for example that no computer however constructed will ever be able to examine the entire tree of possible move sequences of the game of chess
nonetheless bremermann did not foreclose the possibility that a computer would someday be able to solve chess
he wrote in order to have a computer play a perfect or nearly perfect game of chess it will be necessary either to analyze the game completely
or to analyze the game in an approximate way and combine this with a limited amount of tree searching
a theoretical understanding of such heuristic programming however is still very much wanting
recent scientific advances have not significantly changed that assessment
the game of checkers was solved in <year> but it has roughly the square root of the number of positions in chess
jonathan schaeffer the scientist who led the effort said a breakthrough such as quantum computing would be needed before solving chess could even be attempted but he does not rule out the possibility saying that the one thing he learned from his <num> @-@ year effort of solving checkers is to never underestimate the advances in technology

the family moved to hillburn new york where his father ran the general store and he spent much of his childhood
he was an eagle scout
looking back reines said my early childhood memories center around this typical american country store and life in a small american town including independence day july celebrations marked by fireworks and patriotic music played from a pavilion bandstand
reines sang in a chorus and as a soloist
for a time he considered the possibility of a singing career and was instructed by a vocal coach from the metropolitan opera who provided lessons for free because the family did not have the money for them
the family later moved to north bergen new jersey residing on kennedy boulevard and <num> street
because north bergen did not have a high school he attended union hill high school in union hill new jersey from which he graduated in <year>
from an early age reines exhibited an interest in science and liked creating and building things
he later recalled that the first stirrings of interest in science that i remember occurred during a moment of boredom at religious school when looking out of the window at twilight through a hand curled to simulate a telescope i noticed something peculiar about the light it was the phenomenon of diffraction
that began for me a fascination with light
ironically reines excelled in literary and history courses but received average or low marks in science and math in his freshman year of high school though he improved in those areas by his junior and senior years through the encouragement of a teacher who gave him a key to the school laboratory
this cultivated a love of science by his senior year
in response to a question seniors were asked about what they wanted to do for a yearbook quote he responded to be a physicist extraordinaire
reines was accepted into the massachusetts institute of technology but chose instead to attend stevens institute of technology in hoboken new jersey where he earned his bachelor of science b

he married sylvia samuels on august <num> <year>
they had two children robert and alisa
he then entered new york university where he earned his doctor of philosophy ph
d
in <year>
he studied cosmic rays there under serge a

publication of the thesis was delayed until after the end of world war ii it appeared in physical review in <year>
he joined feynman 's t @-@ <num> diffusion problems group which was part of hans bethe 's t theoretical division
diffusion was an important aspect of critical mass calculations
in june <year> he became a group leader heading the t @-@ <num> theory of dragon group
an outgrowth of the tickling the dragon 's tail experiment the dragon was a machine that could attain a critical state for short bursts of time which could be used as a research tool or power source
reines participated in a number of nuclear tests and writing reports on their results
these included operation crossroads at bikini atoll in <year> operation sandstone at eniwetok atoll in <year> and operation ranger and operation buster – jangle at the nevada test site
in <year> he was the director of operation greenhouse series of nuclear tests in the pacific
this saw the first american tests of boosted fission weapons an important step towards thermonuclear weapons
he studied the effects of nuclear blasts and co @-@ authored a paper with john von neumann on mach stem formation an important aspect of an air blast wave
in spite or perhaps because of his role in these nuclear tests reines was concerned about the dangers of radioactive pollution from atmospheric nuclear tests and became an advocate of underground nuclear testing
in the wake of the sputnik crisis he participated in john archibald wheeler 's project <num> which evolved into jason
he was also a delegate at the atoms for peace conference in geneva in <year>
enrico fermi renamed it the neutrino italian for little neutral one and in <year> proposed his theory of beta decay which explained that the electrons emitted from the nucleus were created by the decay of a neutron into a proton an electron and a neutrino n0 → p e − ν e the neutrino accounted for the missing energy but fermi 's theory described a particle with little mass and no electric charge that would be difficult to observe directly
in a <year> paper rudolf peierls and hans bethe calculated that neutrinos could easily pass through the earth and concluded there is no practically possible way of observing the neutrino
in <year> at the conclusion of the greenhouse test series reines received permission from the head of t division j
carson mark for a leave in residence to study fundamental physics
reines and his colleague clyde cowan decided to see if they could detect neutrinos
so why did we want to detect the free neutrino he later explained because everybody said you couldn ’ t do it
according to fermi 's theory there was also a corresponding reverse reaction in which a neutrino combines with a proton to create a neutron and a positron ν e p → n0 e the positron would soon be annihilated by an electron and produce two <num>
<num> mev gamma rays while the neutron would be captured by a proton and release a <num>
<num> mev gamma ray
this would produce a distinctive signature that could be detected
they then realised that by adding cadmium salt to their liquid scintillator to enhance the neutron capture reaction resulting in a <num> mev burst of gamma rays
for a neutrino source they proposed using an atomic bomb
permission for this was obtained from the laboratory director norris bradbury
work began on digging a shaft for the experiment when j
m
b
kellogg convinced them to use a nuclear reactor instead of a bomb
although a less intense source of neutrinos it had the advantage in allowing for multiple experiments to be carried out over a long period of time
in <year> they made their first attempts using one of the large reactors at the hanford nuclear site in what is now known as the cowan – reines neutrino experiment
their detector now included <num> litres <num> imp gal <num> us gal of scintillating fluid and <num> photomultiplier tubes but the effort was frustrated by background noise from cosmic rays
with encouragement from john a
wheeler they tried again in <year> this time using one of the newer larger <num> mw reactors at the savannah river site that emitted a high neutrino flux of <num>
<num> x <num> cm2 sec
they also had a convenient well @-@ shielded location <num> metres <num> ft from the reactor and <num> metres <num> ft underground
on june <num> <year> they were able to send pauli a telegram announcing that the neutrino had been found
when bethe was informed that he had been proven wrong he said well you shouldn ’ t believe everything you read in the papers
from then on reines dedicated the major part of his career to the study of the neutrino ’ s properties and interactions which work would influence study of the neutrino for future researchers to come
cowan left los alamos in <year> to teach at george washington university ending their collaboration
on the basis of his work in first detecting the neutrino reines became the head of the physics department of case western reserve university from <year> to <year>
at case he led a group that was the first to detect neutrinos created in the atmosphere by cosmic rays
reines had a booming voice and had been a singer since childhood
during this time besides performing his duties as a research supervisor and chairman of the physics department reines sang in the cleveland orchestra chorus under the direction of robert shaw in performances with george szell and the cleveland orchestra
in <year> reines took most of his neutrino research team with him when he left for the new university of california irvine uci becoming its first dean of physical sciences
at uci reines extended the research interests of some of his graduate students into the development of medical radiation detectors such as for measuring total radiation delivered to the whole human body in radiation therapy
reines had prepared for the possibility of measuring the distant events of a supernova explosion
supernova explosions are rare but reines thought he might be lucky enough to see one in his lifetime and be able to catch the neutrinos streaming from it in his specially @-@ designed detectors
during his wait for a supernova to explode he put signs on some of his large neutrino detectors calling them supernova early warning systems
in <year> neutrinos emitted from supernova sn1987a were detected by the irvine – michigan – brookhaven imb collaboration which used an <num> @,@ <num> ton cherenkov detector located in a salt mine near cleveland
normally the detectors recorded only a few background events each day
the supernova registered <num> events in just ten seconds
this discovery is regarded as inaugurating the field of neutrino astronomy
in <year> reines was honored along with martin l
perl with the nobel prize in physics for his work with cowan in first detecting the neutrino
unfortunately cowan had died in <year> and the nobel prize is not awarded posthumously
reines also received many other awards including the j
robert oppenheimer memorial prize in <year> the national medal of science in <year> the bruno rossi prize in <year> the michelson – morley award in <year> the panofsky prize in <year> and the franklin medal in <year>
he was elected a member of the national academy of sciences in <year> and a foreign member of the russian academy of sciences in <year>
he remained dean of physical sciences at uci until <year> and became a professor emeritus in <year> but he continued teaching until <year> and remained on uci 's faculty until his death
he was survived by his wife and children
his papers are in the uci libraries
reines hall at uci was named in his honor

in <year> cleary campbell the first white settler in the area built a log cabin near the present site of lock haven university of pennsylvania and by <year> william reed another settler had built a cabin surrounded by a stockade and called it reed 's fort
it was the westernmost of <num> mostly primitive forts along the west branch fort augusta at what is now sunbury was the easternmost and most defensible
in response to settler incursions and encouraged by the british during the american revolution <year> – <num> indians attacked colonists and their settlements along the west branch
fort reed and the other white settlements in the area were temporarily abandoned in <year> during a general evacuation known as the big runaway
hundreds of people fled along the river to fort augusta about <num> miles <num> km from fort reed some did not return for five years

incorporated as a borough in <year> and as a city in <year> lock haven prospered in the <num> century largely because of timber and transportation
the forests of clinton county and counties upriver held a huge supply of white pine and hemlock as well as oak ash maple poplar cherry beech and magnolia
the wood was used locally for such things as frame houses shingles canal boats and wooden bridges and whole logs were floated to chesapeake bay and on to baltimore to make spars for ships
log driving and log rafting competing forms of transporting logs to sawmills began along the west branch around <year>
by <year> slightly before the founding of the town the lumber industry was well established
the west branch canal which opened in <year> ran <num> miles <num> km from northumberland to farrandsville about <num> miles <num> km upstream from lock haven

a privately funded extension the bald eagle and spring creek navigation eventually reached bellefonte <num> miles <num> km upstream
lock haven 's founder jeremiah church and his brother willard chose the town site in <year> partly because of the river the creek and the canal

the rafts were commonly <num> feet <num> m wide — narrow enough to pass through the chutes — and <num> feet <num> m to <num> feet <num> m long
in <year> a large raft got wedged in the chute of the dunnstown dam and caused a jam that blocked the channel from bank to bank with a pile of logs <num> feet <num> m high
the jam eventually trapped another <num> log rafts and <num> canal boats the mammoth of newport and the sarah dunbar
in terms of board feet the peak of the lumber era in pennsylvania arrived in about <year> when <num>
<num> million logs went through the boom at williamsport

rachel ultimately decides to stay and reignite her relationship with ross getting off the plane at the last minute
conceived as a young woman who is unprepared for adulthood the character rachel green was originally named rachel robbins
although critics and audiences initially perceived monica as the show 's main character when friends premiered the writers had actually given rachel the pilot 's most prominent storyline
before deciding that rachel and ross would be an item for the entire series the writers had originally intended for the show 's defining couple to be joey and monica
however after the success of the pilot in which rachel and ross developing romance is first hinted at and witnessing aniston and co @-@ star david schwimmer 's on @-@ screen chemistry for the first time crane and kauffman determined that the entire series relied on finding all the wonderful roadblocks for them to be with each other
audiences began rooting for rachel and ross union since the very beginning of friends openly voicing their frustration with rachel ’ s obliviousness to ross feelings for her
the episode that would ultimately transform the friends relationship for the remainder of the series was the first season finale the one where rachel finds out in which rachel finally learns of ross true feelings for her at the same time discovering she actually feels the same
however the episode nearly went unwritten because at the time few friends writers were expecting the couple 's relationship to morph into the phenomenon that it ultimately became
the episode was first suggested by director james burrows the writers felt that it was time to alter the couple 's dynamic in order to avoid the repetitive he 's pining she 's oblivious pattern using the work of author jane austen as inspiration on how to finally shift the pining arc from ross to rachel
because stakes for the episode were unprecedentedly high the one where rachel finds out became friends most reworked episode
the couple 's first kiss at the end of season two 's the one where ross finds out was met with deafening applause from the studio audience
crane admitted that keeping viewers interested in their relationship for ten years was challenging
jonathan bernstein of the daily telegraph believes that they accomplished this by dangl ing the possibility of a ross and rachel recoupling through several cliffhangers without ever putting them back together
according to encyclopedia of television author horace newcomb ross and rachel 's ever @-@ changing relationship converted the traditional amnesic plotlines of the situation comedy into ones akin to episodic drama
meanwhile writing for the new york review of books elaine blair agreed that friends created a sense of chemistry between two characters while also putting obstacles in their way setting us up for a long @-@ deferred union
after rachel and ross drunkenly get married while on vacation in las vegas during season five schwimmer had initially objected to the idea of having his character ross divorce her – his third divorce – because he felt that it was taking it too far
the actor explained that the whole arc of the relationship was weird then
because for ross to be able to move on enough to marry someone else and then go back to being in love with rachel later just went a bit too far
rachel and joey 's romantic storyline was conceived because the writers wanted to delay ross and rachel 's reunion further
crane felt that pairing rachel and joey during season ten was for the greater good because it was inappropriate
however the cast initially protested the idea fearing that rachel joey and ross would ultimately become unlikeable characters and audiences would either resent joey for going after a pregnant woman or resent rachel for rejecting him or resent ross for standing between the two of them
meanwhile the writers also approached the concept of rachel 's pregnancy and baby tentatively worrying about how they would include it in the show because they did not want friends to become a show about a baby while on the other hand we don 't want to pretend that there isn 't one
according to robert bianco of usa today the critical success and popularity of rachel 's pregnancy is ultimately responsible for propel ling the show to the top of the ratings
when it finally came time to write the series finale the only thing crane and kauffman absolutely knew from very early on was that we had to get ross and rachel together deciding we had dicked the audience around for <num> years with their will they or won ’ t they and we didn ’ t see any advantage in frustrating them any longer
however at one point the writers had deliberated ending the series with ross and rachel in a gray area of where they aren ’ t together but we hint there ’ s a sense that they might be down the road
ultimately crane and kauffman relented in favor of giving the audience what they want
her decision was initially ridiculed by both her friends as well as actor adam sandler a saturday night live alum
actress téa leoni who at the time was being referred to by the media as the next lucille ball was offered the role of rachel as the studio 's first choice but she declined in favor of starring in the sitcom the naked truth
actress elizabeth berkley also auditioned for the role prior to being cast in the teen sitcom saved by the bell
other actresses who auditioned for rachel include denise richards melissa rivers nicolette sheridan parker posey and jami gertz
originally the producers wanted to cast actress courteney cox as rachel who crane and kauffman were particularly drawn to because of her cheery upbeat energy
additionally cox was the most famous cast member at the time amidst an ensemble of relatively unknown actors
however the actress lobbied for the role of rachel 's best friend monica as whom she was ultimately cast because she felt that she was not quirky enough to play rachel
at the same time although unbeknownst to each other aniston was being considered for the role of monica but fought to play rachel because she felt that the character suited her better
at one point cox had begun to regret her decision to play monica until her own character 's storylines started improving
friends was aniston 's sixth sitcom each of her previous ventures had been canceled prematurely
feeling vulnerable aniston had begun to doubt herself as an actress and personally approached littlefield for reassurance on her career who encouraged her to audition for friends which was being referred to as friends like these at the time
crane and kauffman had worked with aniston prior to this
however casting her as rachel posed a challenge for the network because at the time aniston was simultaneously starring in a developing cbs sitcom called muddling through in which she plays a young woman whose mother is returning home from jail after two years
cbs was initially reluctant to release aniston from her contract which required the actress to balance both roles simultaneously traveling back @-@ and @-@ forth between muddling through and friends for two weeks
meanwhile nbc risked having to recast the role of rachel replace aniston and reshoot several episodes if cbs series proved successful which would have potentially cost the network millions of dollars
however littlefield remained confident that muddling through would fail
essentially the producers of friends hoped that muddling through would be canceled before friends premiered while aniston feared that muddling through would be the more successful of the two sitcoms in spite of her preference towards friends
during this time of uncertainty aniston was forced not to participate in several friends @-@ related promotions and photo shoots the network excluded her from these in case she would be replaced
aniston explained when we were shooting the first grouping of cast photos
i was asked to step out of a bunch because they didn 't know if i was going to be still playing rachel
director james burrows admitted that aniston had been cast in second position
the producers had already begun auditioning other actresses for the part while aniston also received phone calls from her own friends warning her i 'm auditioning for your part in friends
ultimately muddling through was canceled after only three months and ten episodes two weeks before the pilot of friends aired thus allowing aniston to keep her role on the show becoming its second youngest cast member at the age of <num>
crane appreciated aniston 's interpretation of rachel because in the wrong hands rachel is kind of annoying and spoiled and unlikable commending the actress for breathing life into a difficult character
crane and kauffman strongly envisioned friends as an ensemble comedy and warner bros
initially marketed the show as such by having the cast appear in their entirety for all press interviews and photo shoots
one of few sitcoms at the time to be neither a workplace comedy family sitcom or star a famous comedian elizabeth kolbert of the new york times explained that each of the show 's main characters are of equal importance
as a writer crane preferred it this way because utilizing six equal players rather than emphasizing one or two would allow for myriad story lines
kauffman echoed that friends worked best when the entire ensemble was onstage
the only reason aniston is credited first during the show 's title sequence is because the cast is listed alphabetically
the show 's ensemble format is also believed to have prevented jealous conflicts among the cast
famously the friends cast became the first in television history to negotiate as a group for equal salaries refusing to work until their demands of <num> @,@ <num> per episode were met during season three which eventually increased to <num> million per episode by seasons nine and ten – approximately <num> million per year
alongside cox and actress lisa kudrow who portrays phoebe aniston became the highest @-@ paid television actress of all time
by then aniston had surpassed cox as the show 's most famous cast member due to having launched an international hair trend with the rachel and successfully transitioning into a film career combined with her high @-@ profile relationship with her then @-@ husband actor brad pitt who had once guest starred in an episode of the show
at times the producers would use the actress popularity to boost the show 's ratings notably her character 's seventh season kiss with actress winona ryder and pregnancy arc
aniston had been telling the press that the show 's ninth season would be her last and was initially hesitant to return to friends to film its tenth and final season
she explained to nbc 's matt lauer i wanted it to end when people still loved us and we were on a high
and then i was also feeling like ‘ how much more of rachel do i have in me ’ ” however the actress ultimately agreed to complete the tenth season of friends which was reduced from <num> to <num> episodes to accommodate aniston 's busy film schedule

the route through the strategically important homs gap connects the cities of tripoli and homs
to the north of the castle lies the jebel ansariyah and to the south lebanon
the surrounding area is fertile benefiting from streams and abundant rainfall
compared to the kingdom of jerusalem the other crusader states had less land suitable for farming however the limestone peaks of tripoli were well @-@ suited to defensive sites
property in the county of tripoli granted to the knights templar in the <num> included the castle of the kurds the towns of rafanea and montferrand and the buqai 'ah plain separating homs and tripoli
homs was never under crusader control so the region around the castle of the kurds was vulnerable to expeditions from the city
while its proximity caused the knights problems with regard to defending their territory it also meant homs was close enough for them to raid
because of the castle 's command of the plain it became the knights most important base in the area
the site was strategically located at the southern edge of the jibal al @-@ alawiyin mountain range and dominated the road between homs and tripoli
when building castles muslims often chose elevated sites such as hills and mountains that provided natural obstacles
in january <num> on the journey to jerusalem during the first crusade the company of raymond iv of toulouse came under attack from the garrison of hisn al @-@ akrad the forerunner of the krak who harried raymond 's foragers
the following day raymond marched on the castle and found it deserted
the crusaders briefly occupied the castle in february of the same year but abandoned it when they continued their march towards jerusalem
permanent occupation began in <num> when tancred prince of galilee took control of the site
the early castle was substantially different from the extant remains and no trace of this first castle survives at the site
the origins of the knights hospitaller are unclear but the order probably emerged around the <num> in jerusalem
it started as a religious order which cared for the sick and later looked after pilgrims to the holy land
after the success of the first crusade in capturing jerusalem in <num> many crusaders donated their new property in the levant to the hospital of st john
early donations were in the newly formed kingdom of jerusalem but over time the order extended its holdings to the crusader states of the county of tripoli and the principality of antioch
evidence suggests that in the <num> the order became militarized when fulk king of jerusalem granted the newly built castle at bethgibelin to the order in <num>
a papal bull from between <num> and <num> may indicate the order hiring people to defend pilgrims
there were also other military orders such as the knights templar which offered protection to pilgrims
between <num> and <num> raymond ii count of tripoli granted the order property in the county
according to historian jonathan riley @-@ smith the hospitallers effectively established a palatinate within tripoli
the property included castles with which the hospitallers were expected to defend tripoli
along with krak des chevaliers the hospitallers were given four other castles along the borders of the state which allowed the order to dominate the area
the order 's agreement with raymond ii stated that if he did not accompany knights of the order on campaign the spoils belonged entirely to the order and if he was present it was split equally between the count and the order
raymond ii could further not make peace with the muslims without the permission of the hospitallers
the hospitallers made krak des chevaliers a center of administration for their new property undertaking work at the castle that would make it one of the most elaborate crusader fortifications in the levant
after acquiring the site in <num> they began building a new castle to replace the former kurdish fortification
this work lasted until <num> when an earthquake damaged the castle
an arab source mentions that the quake destroyed the castle 's chapel which was replaced by the present chapel
in <num> the crusaders emerged victorious over nur ad @-@ din in the battle of al @-@ buqaia near krak des chevaliers
drought conditions between <num> and <num> prompted the crusaders to sign a two @-@ year truce with the muslims but without tripoli included in the terms
during the <num> raids by christians and muslims into each other 's territory became more frequent
in <num> saladin ventured into the county of tripoli ravaging the area
unwilling to meet him in open battle the crusaders retreated to the relative safety of their fortifications
without capturing the castles saladin could not secure control of the area and once he retreated the hospitallers were able to revitalize their damaged lands
the battle of hattin in <num> was a disastrous defeat for the crusaders guy of lusignan king of jerusalem was captured as was the true cross a relic discovered during the first crusade
afterwards saladin ordered the execution of the captured templar and hospitaller knights such was the importance of the two orders in defending the crusader states
after the battle the hospitaller castles of belmont belvoir and bethgibelin fell to muslim armies
following these losses the order focused its attention on its castles in tripoli
in may <num> saladin led an army to attack krak des chevaliers but on seeing the castle decided it was too well defended and instead marched on the hospitaller castle of margat which he also failed to capture
another earthquake struck in <num> and it may have been after this event that the castle was remodelled
the <num> @-@ century work was the last period of building at krak des chevaliers and gave it its current appearance
an enclosing stone circuit was built between <num> and <num> the earlier structure became the castle 's inner court or ward
if there was a circuit of walls surrounding the inner court that pre @-@ dated the current outer walls no trace of it has been discovered
the first half of the <num> century has been characterized as krak des chevaliers golden age
while other crusader strongholds came under threat krak des chevaliers and its garrison of <num> @,@ <num> soldiers dominated the surrounding area
it was effectively the center of a principality which remained in crusader hands until <num> and was the only major inland area to remain constantly under crusader control during this period
crusaders who passed through the area would often stop at the castle and probably made donations
king andrew ii of hungary visited in <num> and proclaimed the castle the key of the christian lands
he was so impressed with the castle that he gave a yearly income of <num> marks to the master and <num> to the brothers
geoffroy de joinville uncle of the noted chronicler of the crusades jean de joinville died at krak des chevaliers in <num> or <num> and was buried in the castle 's chapel
the main contemporary accounts relating to krak des chevaliers are of muslim origin and tend to emphasize muslim success while overlooking setbacks against the crusaders although they suggest that the knights hospitaller forced the settlements of hama and homs to pay tribute to the order
this situation lasted as long as saladin 's successors warred between themselves
the proximity of krak des chevaliers to muslim territories allowed it to take on an offensive role acting as a base from which neighboring areas could be attacked
by <num> the garrison were making raids on montferrand which was under muslim control and hama and in <num> and <num> the castle 's soldiers took part in an attack on homs
krak des chevaliers acted as a base for expeditions to hama in <num> and <num> after the amir refused to pay tribute
the former was unsuccessful but the <num> expedition was a show of force that demonstrated the importance of krak des chevaliers
in the <num> the fortunes of the hospitallers at krak des chevaliers took a turn for the worse
a muslim army estimated to number <num> @,@ <num> men ravaged the countryside around the castle in <num> after which the order 's finances declined sharply
in <num> master hugh revel complained that the area previously home to around <num> @,@ <num> people now stood deserted and that the order 's property in the kingdom of jerusalem produced little income
he also noted that by this point there were only <num> of the order 's brethren left in the east
on the muslim side in <num> baibars became sultan of egypt following his overthrow of the incumbent ruler qutuz and went on to unite egypt and syria
as a result muslim settlements that had previously paid tribute to the hospitallers at krak des chevaliers no longer felt intimidated into doing so
baibars ventured into the area around krak des chevaliers in <num> and allowed his men to graze their animals on the fields around the castle
when he received news that year of the eighth crusade led by king louis ix of france baibars left for cairo to avoid a confrontation
after louis died in <num> baibars returned to deal with krak des chevaliers
before he marched on the castle the sultan captured the smaller castles in the area including chastel blanc
on <num> march baibars army arrived at krak des chevaliers
by the time the sultan appeared on the scene the castle may already have been blockaded by mamluk forces for several days
of the three arabic accounts of the siege only one was contemporary that of ibn shaddad although he was not present at the siege
peasants who lived in the area had fled to the castle for safety and were kept in the outer ward
as soon as baibars arrived he erected mangonels powerful siege weapons which he would later turn on the castle
in a probable reference to a walled suburb outside the castle 's entrance ibn shaddad records that two days later the first line of defences fell to the besiegers
rain interrupted the siege but on <num> march immediately south of krak des chevaliers baibar 's forces captured a triangular outwork possibly defended by a timber palisade
on <num> march the attackers undermined a tower in the southwest corner causing it to collapse whereupon baibars army attacked through the breach
in the outer ward they encountered the peasants who had sought refuge in the castle
though the outer ward had fallen with a handful of the garrison killed in the process the crusaders retreated to the more formidable inner ward
after a lull of ten days the besiegers conveyed a letter to the garrison supposedly from the grand master of the knights hospitaller in tripoli which granted permission for them to surrender
although the letter was a forgery the garrison capitulated and the sultan spared their lives
the new owners of the castle undertook repairs focused mainly on the outer ward
the hospitaller chapel was converted to a mosque and two mihrabs were added to the interior
it was not until the <num> century that interest in these buildings was renewed so there are no detailed plans from before <year>
guillaume rey was the first european researcher to scientifically study crusader castles in the holy land
in <year> he published the work etudes sur les monuments de l 'architecture militaire des croisés en syrie et dans l 'ile de chypre it included plans and drawings of the major crusader castles in syria including krak des chevaliers
in some instances his drawings were inaccurate however for krak des chavaliers they record features which have since been lost
paul deschamps visited the castle in february <year>
since rey had visited in the <num> century a village of <num> people had been established within the castle
renewed inhabitation had damaged the site underground vaults had been used as rubbish tips and in some places the battlements had been destroyed
deschamps and fellow architect françois anus attempted to clear some of the detritus general maurice gamelin assigned <num> alawite soldiers to help
deschamps left in march <year> and work resumed when he returned two years later
the culmination of deschamp 's work at the castle was the publication of les châteaux des croisés en terre sainte i le crac des chevaliers in <year> with detailed plans by anus
the survey has been widely praised described as brilliant and exhaustive by military historian d
j
cathcart king in <year> and perhaps the finest account of the archaeology and history of a single medieval castle ever written by historian hugh kennedy in <year>
as early as <year> there were suggestions that the castle should be taken under french control
on <num> november <year> krak des chevaliers was given into the control of the french state and cared for by the académie des beaux @-@ arts
the villagers were moved and paid f1 million between them in compensation
over the following two years a programme of cleaning and restoration was carried out by a force of <num> workers
once finished krak des chevaliers was one of the key tourist attractions in the french levant
pierre coupel who had undertaken similar work at the tower of the lions and the two castles at sidon supervized the work
despite the restoration no archaeological excavations were carried out
the french mandate of syria and lebanon which had been established in <year> ended in <year> with the declaration of syrian independence
the castle was made a world heritage site by unesco along with qal ’ at salah el @-@ din in <year> and is owned by the syrian government
several of the castle 's former residents built their houses outside the fortress and a village called al @-@ husn has since developed
many of the al @-@ husn 's roughly <num> @,@ <num> muslim residents benefit economically from the tourism generated by the site
it has been reported that the castle was shelled in august <year> by the syrian arab army and the crusader chapel has been damaged
the castle was reported to have been damaged in july <year> by an airstrike during the siege of homs and once more on the <num> of august <year> it was clearly damaged yet the amount of destruction is unknown
the syrian arab army recaptured the castle and the village of al @-@ hosn from rebel forces on march <num> <year> although the extent of damage from earlier mortar hits remained unclear
e
lawrence popularly known as lawrence of arabia remarked that krak des chevaliers was perhaps the best preserved and most wholly admirable castle in the world a castle which forms a fitting commentary on any account of the crusading buildings of syria
castles in europe provided lordly accommodation for their owners and were centers of administration in the levant the need for defence was paramount and was reflected in castle design
kennedy suggests that the castle scientifically designed as a fighting machine surely reached its apogee in great buildings like margat and crac des chevaliers
krak des chevaliers can be classified both as a spur castle due to its site and after the <num> @-@ century expansion a fully developed concentric castle
it was similar in size and layout to vadum jacob a crusader castle built in the late <num>
margat has also been cited as krak des chevaliers sister castle
the main building material at krak des chevaliers was limestone the ashlar facing is so fine that the mortar is barely noticeable
outside the castle 's entrance was a walled suburb known as a burgus no trace of which remains
to the south of the outer ward was a triangular outwork and the crusaders may have intended to build stone walls and towers around it
it is unknown how it was defended at the time of the <num> siege though it has been suggested it was surrounded by a timber palisade
south of the castle the spur on which it stands is connected to the next hill so that siege engines can approach on level ground
the inner defences are strongest at this point with a cluster of towers connected by a thick wall
the castle was defended by a stone curtain wall studded with square towers which projected slightly
the main entrance was between two towers on the eastern side and there was a postern gate in the northwest tower
at the center was a courtyard surrounded by vaulted chambers
the lay of the land dictated the castle 's irregular shape
a site with natural defences was a typical location for crusader castles and steep slopes provided krak des chevaliers with defences on all sides bar one where the castle 's defences were concentrated
this phase of building was incorporated into the later castle 's construction
when krak des chevaliers was remodelled in the <num> century new walls surrounding the inner court were built
they followed the earlier walls with a narrow gap between them in the west and south which was turned into a gallery from which defenders could unleash missiles
in this area the walls were supported by a steeply sloping glacis which provided additional protection against both siege weapons and earthquakes
four large round towers project vertically from the glacis they were used as accommodation for the knights of the garrison about <num> at its peak
the southwest tower was designed to house the rooms of the grand master of the knights hospitaller
though the defences which once crested the walls of the inner wards no longer survive in most places it seems that they did not extend for the entire circuit
machicolations were absent from the southern face
the area between the inner court and the outer walls was narrow and not used for accommodation
in the east where the defences were weakest there was an open cistern filled by an aqueduct
it acted both as a moat and water supply for the castle
at the north end of the small courtyard is a chapel and at the southern end is an esplanade
the esplanade is raised above the rest of the courtyard the vaulted area beneath it would have provided storage and could have acted as stabling and shelter from missiles
lining the west of the courtyard is the hall of the knights
though probably first built in the <num> century the interior dates from the <num> @-@ century remodelling
the tracery and delicate decoration is a sophisticated example of gothic architecture probably dating from the <num>
only the east end of the original chapel which housed the apse and a small part of the south wall survive from the original chapel
the later chapel had a barrel vault and an uncomplicated apse its design would have been considered outmoded by contemporary standards in france but bears similarities to that built around <num> at margat
it was divided into three roughly equal bays
a cornice runs round the chapel at the point where the vault ends and the wall begins
oriented roughly east to west it was <num>
<num> metres <num> ft long and <num>
<num> metres <num> ft wide with the main entrance from the west and a second smaller one in the north wall
when the castle was remodelled in the early <num> century the entrance was moved to the south wall
the chapel was lit by windows above the cornice one at the west end one on either side of the east bay and one on the south side of the central bay and the apse at the east end had a large window
in <year> a second chapel was discovered outside the castle 's main entrance however it no longer survives
the outer walls were built in the last major construction on the site lending the krak des chevaliers its current appearance
standing <num> metres <num> ft high the outer circuit had towers that projected strongly from the wall
while the towers of the inner court had a square plan and did not project far beyond the wall the towers of the <num> @-@ century outer walls were rounded
this design was new and even contemporary templar castles did not have rounded towers
the technique was developed at château gaillard in france by richard the lionheart between <num> and <num>
the extension to the southeast is of lesser quality than the rest of the circuit and was built at an unknown date
probably around the <num> a postern was added to the north wall
arrow slits in the walls and towers were distributed to minimize the amount of dead ground around the castle
machicolations crowned the walls offering defenders a way to hurl projectiles towards enemies at the foot of the wall
they were so cramped archers would have had to crouch inside them
the box machicolations were unusual those at krak des chevaliers were more complex that those at saône or margat and there were no comparable features amongst crusader castles
however they bore similarities to muslim work such as the contemporary defences at the citadel of aleppo
it is unclear which side imitated the other as the date they were added to krak des chevaliers is unknown but it does provide evidence for the diffusion of military ideas between the muslim and christian armies
these defences were accessed by a wall @-@ walk known as a chemin de ronde
in the opinion of historian hugh kennedy the defences of the outer wall were the most elaborate and developed anywhere in the latin east
the whole structure is a brilliantly designed and superbly built fighting machine
when the outer walls were built in the <num> century the main entrance was enhanced
a vaulted corridor led uphill from the outer gate in the northeast
the corridor made a hairpin turn halfway along its length making it an example of a bent entrance
bent entrances were a byzantine innovation but that at krak des chevaliers was a particularly complex example
it extended for <num> metres <num> ft and along its length were murder @-@ holes which allowed defenders to shower attackers with missiles
anyone going straight ahead rather than following the hairpin turn would emerge in the area between the castle 's two circuits of walls
to access the inner ward the passage had to be followed round
in <year> <year> and <year> medieval frescoes were discovered within krak des chevaliers after later plaster and white @-@ wash had decayed
the frescos were painted on the interior and exterior of the main chapel and the chapel outside the main entrance which no longer survives
writing in <year> historian jaroslav folda noted that at the time there had been little investigation of crusader frescoes that would provide a comparison for the fragmentary remains found at krak des chevaliers
those in the chapel were painted on the masonry from the <num> – <num> rebuild
mold smoke and moisture have made it difficult to preserve the frescoes
the fragmentary nature of the red and blue frescoes inside the chapel means they are difficult to assess
the one on the exterior of the chapel depicted the presentation of jesus at the temple
first performed on <num> february <year> at the st james 's theatre in london it is a farcical comedy in which the protagonists maintain fictitious personæ to escape burdensome social obligations
working within the social conventions of late victorian london the play 's major themes are the triviality with which it treats institutions as serious as marriage and the resulting satire of victorian ways
contemporary reviews all praised the play 's humour though some were cautious about its explicit lack of social messages while others foresaw the modern consensus that it was the culmination of wilde 's artistic career so far
its high farce and witty dialogue have helped make the importance of being earnest wilde 's most enduringly popular play
the successful opening night marked the climax of wilde 's career but also heralded his downfall
the marquess of queensberry whose son lord alfred douglas was wilde 's lover planned to present the writer with a bouquet of rotten vegetables and disrupt the show
wilde was tipped off and queensberry was refused admission
soon afterwards their feud came to a climax in court where wilde 's homosexual double life was revealed to the victorian public and he was eventually sentenced to imprisonment
his notoriety caused the play despite its early success to be closed after <num> performances
after his release he published the play from exile in paris but he wrote no further comic or dramatic work
the importance of being earnest has been revived many times since its premiere
it has been adapted for the cinema on three occasions
in the importance of being earnest <year> dame edith evans reprised her celebrated interpretation of lady bracknell the importance of being earnest <year> by kurt baker used an all @-@ black cast and oliver parker 's the importance of being earnest <year> incorporated some of wilde 's original material cut during the preparation of the original stage production
in july <year> he mooted his idea for the importance of being earnest to george alexander the actor @-@ manager of the st james 's theatre
wilde spent the summer with his family at worthing where he wrote the play quickly in august
his fame now at its peak he used the working title lady lancing to avoid pre @-@ emptive speculation of its content
many names and ideas in the play were borrowed from people or places the author had known lady queensberry lord alfred douglas 's mother for example lived at bracknell
there is widespread agreement among wilde scholars that the most important influence on the play was w
s
gilbert 's <year> farce engaged wilde borrowed from gilbert not only several incidents but in russell jackson 's phrase the gravity of tone demanded by gilbert of his actors
wilde continually revised the text over the next months no line was left untouched and in a play so economical with its language and effects the revisions had serious consequences
sos eltis describes wilde 's revisions as a refined art at work the earliest longest handwritten drafts of the play labour over farcical incidents broad puns nonsense dialogue and conventional comic turns
in revising as he did wilde transformed standard nonsense into the more systemic and disconcerting illogicality which characterises earnest 's dialogue
richard ellmann argues that wilde had reached his artistic maturity and wrote this work more surely and rapidly than before
wilde hesitated about submitting the script to alexander worrying that it might be unsuitable for the st james 's theatre whose typical repertoire was relatively serious and explaining that it had been written in response to a request for a play with no real serious interest
when henry james 's guy domville failed alexander turned to wilde and agreed to put on his play
alexander began his usual meticulous preparations interrogating the author on each line and planning stage movements with a toy theatre
in the course of these rehearsals alexander asked wilde to shorten the play from four acts to three
wilde agreed and combined elements of the second and third acts
the largest cut was the removal of the character of mr
gribsby a solicitor who comes from london to arrest the profligate ernest i
e
jack for his unpaid dining bills
algernon who is posing as ernest will be led away to holloway jail unless he settles his accounts immediately
jack finally agrees to pay for ernest everyone thinking that it is algernon 's bill when in fact it is his own
the four @-@ act version was first played on the radio in a bbc production and is still sometimes performed
peter raby argues that the three @-@ act structure is more effective and that the shorter original text is more theatrically resonant than the expanded published edition
it was freezing cold but wilde arrived dressed in florid sobriety wearing a green carnation
the audience according to one report included many members of the great and good former cabinet ministers and privy councillors as well as actors writers academics and enthusiasts
allan aynesworth who played algernon moncrieff recalled to hesketh pearson that in my fifty @-@ three years of acting i never remember a greater triumph than that first night
aynesworth was himself debonair and stylish and alexander who played jack worthing demure
the cast was john worthing j

george canninge the marquess of queensberry the father of wilde 's lover lord alfred douglas who was on holiday in algiers at the time had planned to disrupt the play by throwing a bouquet of rotten vegetables at the playwright when he took his bow at the end of the show
wilde and alexander learned of the plan and the latter cancelled queensberry 's ticket and arranged for policemen to bar his entrance
nevertheless he continued harassing wilde who eventually launched a private prosecution against the peer for criminal libel triggering a series of trials ending in wilde 's imprisonment for gross indecency
alexander tried unsuccessfully to save the production by removing wilde 's name from the billing but the play had to close after only <num> performances
the play 's original broadway production opened at the empire theatre on <num> april <year> but closed after sixteen performances
its cast included william faversham as algy henry miller as jack viola allen as gwendolen and ida vernon as lady bracknell
the australian premiere was in melbourne on <num> august <year> presented by dion boucicault jr
and robert brough and the play was an immediate success
wilde 's downfall in england did not affect the popularity of his plays in australia
though unsure of wilde 's seriousness as a dramatist they recognised the play 's cleverness humour and popularity with audiences
george bernard shaw for example reviewed the play in the saturday review arguing that comedy should touch as well as amuse i go to the theatre to be moved to laughter
later in a letter he said the play though extremely funny was wilde 's first really heartless one
in the world william archer wrote that he had enjoyed watching the play but found it to be empty of meaning what can a poor critic do with a play which raises no principle whether of art or morals creates its own canons and conventions and is nothing but an absolutely wilful expression of an irrepressibly witty personality in the speaker a
b
walkley admired the play and was one of few to see it as the culmination of wilde 's dramatic career
he denied the term farce was derogatory or even lacking in seriousness and said it is of nonsense all compact and better nonsense i think our stage has not seen
h
g
wells in an unsigned review for the pall mall gazette called earnest one of the freshest comedies of the year saying more humorous dealing with theatrical conventions it would be difficult to imagine
he also questioned whether people would fully see its message
how serious people will take this trivial comedy intended for their learning remains to be seen
no doubt seriously
the play was so light @-@ hearted that many reviewers compared it to comic opera rather than drama
w
h
auden later called it a pure verbal opera and the times commented the story is almost too preposterous to go without music
mary mccarthy in sights and spectacles <year> however and despite thinking the play extremely funny would call it a ferocious idyll depravity is the hero and the only character
the importance of being earnest is wilde 's most popular work and is continually revived
max beerbohm called the play wilde 's finest most undeniably his own saying that in his other comedies — lady windermere 's fan a woman of no importance and an ideal husband — the plot following the manner of victorien sardou is unrelated to the theme of the work while in earnest the story is dissolved into the form of the play
alexander revived the importance in a small theatre in notting hill outside the west end in <year> in the same year he presented the piece on tour playing jack worthing with a cast including the young lilian braithwaite as cecily
the play returned to the west end when alexander presented a revival at the st james 's in <year>
broadway revivals were mounted in <year> and again in <year> each production running for six weeks
a collected edition of wilde 's works published in <year> and edited by robert ross helped to restore his reputation as an author
alexander presented another revival of the importance at the st james 's in <year> when he and aynesworth reprised their original roles the revival ran for <num> performances
max beerbohm said that the play was sure to become a classic of the english repertory and that its humour was as fresh then as when it had been written adding that the actors had worn as well as the play
for a <year> revival at the same theatre the young actors gerald ames and a
e
matthews succeeded the creators as jack and algy
john deverell as jack and margaret scudamore as lady bracknell headed the cast in a <year> production at the haymarket theatre
many revivals in the first decades of the <num> century treated the present as the current year
it was not until the <num> that the case for <num> costumes was established as a critic in the manchester guardian put it thirty years on one begins to feel that wilde should be done in the costume of his period — that his wit today needs the backing of the atmosphere that gave it life and truth
… wilde 's glittering and complex verbal felicities go ill with the shingle and the short skirt
in sir nigel playfair 's <year> production at the lyric hammersmith john gielgud played jack to the lady bracknell of his aunt mabel terry @-@ lewis
gielgud produced and starred in a production at the globe now the gielgud theatre in <year> in a cast that included edith evans as lady bracknell joyce carey as gwendolen angela baddeley as cecily and margaret rutherford as miss prism
the times considered the production the best since the original and praised it for its fidelity to wilde 's conception its airy responsive ball @-@ playing quality
later in the same year gielgud presented the work again with jack hawkins as algy gwen ffrangcon @-@ davies as gwendolen and peggy ashcroft as cecily with evans and rutherford in their previous roles
the production was presented in several seasons during and after the second world war with mostly the same main players
during a <year> season at the haymarket the king and queen attended a performance which as the journalist geoffrey wheatcroft put it gave the play a final accolade of respectability
the production toured north america and was successfully staged on broadway in <year>
as wilde 's work came to be read and performed again it was the importance of being earnest that received the most productions
by the time of its centenary the journalist mark lawson described it as the second most known and quoted play in english after hamlet
for sir peter hall 's <year> production at the national theatre the cast included judi dench as lady bracknell martin jarvis as jack nigel havers as algy zoë wanamaker as gwendolen and anna massey as miss prism
nicholas hytner 's <year> production at the aldwych theatre starring maggie smith had occasional references to the supposed gay subtext
in <year> the abbey theatre dublin produced the play with an all @-@ male cast it also featured wilde as a character — the play opens with him drinking in a parisian café dreaming of his play
the melbourne theatre company staged a production in december <year> with geoffrey rush as lady bracknell
in <year> the roundabout theatre company produced a broadway revival based on the <year> stratford shakespeare festival production featuring brian bedford as director and as lady bracknell
it opened at the american airlines theatre on <num> january and ran until <num> july <year>
the cast also included dana ivey as miss prism paxton whitehead as canon chasuble santino fontana as algernon paul o 'brien as lane charlotte parry as cecily david furr as jack and sara topham as gwendolen
it was nominated for three tony awards
the play was also presented internationally in singapore in october <year> by the british theatre playhouse and the same company brought it to london 's greenwich theatre in april <year>

ernest has come from the country to propose to algernon 's cousin gwendolen fairfax
algernon however refuses his consent until ernest explains why his cigarette case bears the inscription from little cecily with her fondest love to her dear uncle jack
ernest is forced to admit to living a double life
in the country he assumes a serious attitude for the benefit of his young ward the heiress cecily cardew and goes by the name of john or as a nickname jack while pretending that he must worry about a wastrel younger brother named ernest in london
in the city meanwhile he assumes the identity of the libertine ernest
algernon confesses a similar deception he pretends to have an invalid friend named bunbury in the country whom he can visit whenever he wishes to avoid an unwelcome social obligation
jack refuses to tell algernon the location of his country estate
gwendolen and her formidable mother lady bracknell now call on algernon who distracts lady bracknell in another room while jack proposes to gwendolen
she accepts but seems to love him very largely for his professed name of ernest
jack accordingly resolves to himself to be rechristened ernest
discovering them in this intimate exchange lady bracknell interviews jack as a prospective suitor
horrified to learn that he was adopted after being discovered as a baby in a handbag at victoria station she refuses him and forbids further contact with her daughter
gwendolen though manages covertly to promise to him her undying love
as jack gives her his address in the country algernon surreptitiously notes it on the cuff of his sleeve jack 's revelation of his pretty and wealthy young ward has motivated his friend to meet her
algernon arrives pretending to be ernest worthing and soon charms cecily
long fascinated by uncle jack 's hitherto absent black sheep brother she is predisposed to fall for algernon in his role of ernest a name she like gwendolen is apparently particularly fond of
therefore algernon too plans for the rector dr
chasuble to rechristen him ernest
jack meanwhile has decided to abandon his double life
he arrives in full mourning and announces his brother 's death in paris of a severe chill a story undermined by algernon 's presence in the guise of ernest
gwendolen now enters having run away from home
during the temporary absence of the two men she meets cecily each woman indignantly declaring that she is the one engaged to ernest
when jack and algernon reappear their deceptions are exposed
the revelation of cecily 's trust fund soon dispels lady bracknell 's initial doubts over the young lady 's suitability but any engagement is forbidden by her guardian jack he will consent only if lady bracknell agrees to his own union with gwendolen — something she declines to do
the impasse is broken by the return of miss prism whom lady bracknell recognises as the person who twenty @-@ eight years earlier as a family nursemaid had taken a baby boy for a walk in a perambulator baby carriage and never returned
challenged miss prism explains that she had absentmindedly put the manuscript of a novel she was writing in the perambulator and the baby in a handbag which she had left at victoria station
jack produces the very same handbag showing that he is the lost baby the elder son of lady bracknell 's late sister and thus indeed algernon 's elder brother
having acquired such respectable relations he is acceptable as a suitor for gwendolen after all
gwendolen though still insists that she can only love a man named ernest
what is her fiancé 's real first name lady bracknell informs jack that as the first @-@ born he would have been named after his father general moncrieff
jack examines the army lists and discovers that his father 's name — and hence his own real name — was in fact ernest
pretence was reality all along
as the happy couples embrace — jack and gwendolen algernon and cecily and even dr
chasuble and miss prism — lady bracknell complains to her newfound relative my nephew you seem to be displaying signs of triviality
on the contrary aunt augusta he replies i 've now realised for the first time in my life the vital importance of being earnest
as the most trivial of wilde 's society plays and the only one that produces that peculiar exhilaration of the spirit by which we recognise the beautiful
it is he wrote precisely because it is consistently trivial that it is not ugly
ellmann says that the importance of being earnest touched on many themes wilde had been building since the <num> — the languor of aesthetic poses was well established and wilde takes it as a starting point for the two protagonists
while salome an ideal husband and the picture of dorian gray had dwelt on more serious wrongdoing vice in earnest is represented by algy 's craving for cucumber sandwiches
wilde told robert ross that the play 's theme was that we should treat all trivial things in life very seriously and all serious things of life with a sincere and studied triviality
the theme is hinted at in the play 's ironic title and earnestness is repeatedly alluded to in the dialogue algernon says in act ii one has to be serious about something if one is to have any amusement in life but goes on to reproach jack for being serious about everything
blackmail and corruption had haunted the double lives of dorian gray and sir robert chiltern in an ideal husband but in earnest the protagonists duplicity algernon 's bunburying and worthing 's double life as jack and ernest is undertaken for more innocent purposes — largely to avoid unwelcome social obligations
while much theatre of the time tackled serious social and political issues earnest is superficially about nothing at all
it refuses to play the game of other dramatists of the period for instance bernard shaw who used their characters to draw audiences to grander ideals
in victorian times earnestness was considered to be the over @-@ riding societal value originating in religious attempts to reform the lower classes it spread to the upper ones too throughout the century
the play 's very title with its mocking paradox serious people are so because they do not see trivial comedies introduces the theme it continues in the drawing room discussion yes but you must be serious about it
i hate people who are not serious about meals
it is so shallow of them says algernon in act <num> allusions are quick and from multiple angles
wilde managed both to engage with and to mock the genre while providing social commentary and offering reform
the men follow traditional matrimonial rites whereby suitors admit their weaknesses to their prospective brides but the foibles they excuse are ridiculous and the farce is built on an absurd confusion of a book and a baby
when jack apologises to gwendolen during his marriage proposal it is for not being wicked jack gwendolen it is a terrible thing for a man to find out suddenly that all his life he has been speaking nothing but the truth
can you forgive me gwendolen i can
for i feel that you are sure to change
in turn both gwendolen and cecily have the ideal of marrying a man named ernest a popular and respected name at the time
gwendolen quite unlike her mother 's methodical analysis of john worthing 's suitability as a husband places her entire faith in a christian name declaring in act i the only really safe name is ernest
this is an opinion shared by cecily in act ii i pity any poor married woman whose husband is not called ernest and they indignantly declare that they have been deceived when they find out the men 's real names
wilde embodied society 's rules and rituals artfully into lady bracknell minute attention to the details of her style created a comic effect of assertion by restraint
in contrast to her encyclopaedic knowledge of the social distinctions of london 's street names jack 's obscure parentage is subtly evoked
he defends himself against her a handbag with the clarification the brighton line
at the time victoria station consisted of two separate but adjacent terminal stations sharing the same name
to the east was the ramshackle lc d railway on the west the up @-@ market lb scr — the brighton line which went to worthing the fashionable expensive town the gentleman who found baby jack was travelling to at the time and after which jack was named
on re @-@ reading the play after his release from prison wilde said it was extraordinary reading the play over
how i used to toy with that tiger life
as one scholar has put it the absolute necessity for homosexuals of the period to need a public mask is a factor contributing to the satire on social disguise
the use of the name earnest may have been a homosexual in @-@ joke
in <year> three years before wilde wrote the play john gambril nicholson had published the book of pederastic poetry love in earnest
the sonnet of boys names included the verse though frank may ring like silver bell and cecil softer music claim they cannot work the miracle – tis ernest sets my heart a @-@ flame
the word earnest may also have been a code @-@ word for homosexual as in is he earnest in the same way that is he so and is he musical were employed
sir donald sinden an actor who had met two of the play 's original cast irene vanbrugh and allan aynesworth and lord alfred douglas wrote to the times to dispute suggestions that earnest held any sexual connotations although they had ample opportunity at no time did any of them even hint that earnest was a synonym for homosexual or that bunburying may have implied homosexual sex
the first time i heard it mentioned was in the <num> and i immediately consulted sir john gielgud whose own performance of jack worthing in the same play was legendary and whose knowledge of theatrical lore was encyclopaedic
he replied in his ringing tones no @-@ no nonsense absolute nonsense i would have known
a number of theories have also been put forward to explain the derivation of bunbury and bunburying which are used in the play to imply a secretive double life
it may have derived from henry shirley bunbury a hypochondriacal acquaintance of wilde 's youth
another suggestion put forward in <year> by aleister crowley who knew wilde was that bunbury was a combination word that wilde had once taken train to banbury met a schoolboy there and arranged a second secret meeting with him at sunbury
while his earlier comedies suffer from an unevenness resulting from the thematic clash between the trivial and the serious earnest achieves a pitch @-@ perfect style that allows these to dissolve
there are three different registers detectable in the play
the dandyish insouciance of jack and algernon — established early with algernon 's exchange with his manservant — betrays an underlying unity despite their differing attitudes
the formidable pronouncements of lady bracknell are as startling for her use of hyperbole and rhetorical extravagance as for her disconcerting opinions
in contrast the speech of dr
chasuble and miss prism is distinguished by pedantic precept and idiosyncratic diversion
furthermore the play is full of epigrams and paradoxes
max beerbohm described it as littered with chiselled apophthegms — witticisms unrelated to action or character of which he found half a dozen to be of the highest order
lady bracknell 's line a handbag has been called one of the most malleable in english drama lending itself to interpretations ranging from incredulous or scandalised to baffled
edith evans both on stage and in the <year> film delivered the line loudly in a mixture of horror incredulity and condescension
stockard channing in the gaiety theatre dublin in <year> hushed the line in a critic 's words with a barely audible a handbag rapidly swallowed up with a sharp intake of breath
an understated take to be sure but with such a well @-@ known play packed full of witticisms and aphorisms with a life of their own it 's the little things that make a difference
lady bracknell for instance embodies respectable upper @-@ class society but eltis notes how her development from the familiar overbearing duchess into a quirkier and more disturbing character can be traced through wilde 's revisions of the play
for the two young men wilde presents not stereotypical stage dudes but intelligent beings who as jackson puts it speak like their creator in well @-@ formed complete sentences and rarely use slang or vogue @-@ words
dr chasuble and miss prism are characterised by a few light touches of detail their old @-@ fashioned enthusiasms and the canon 's fastidious pedantry pared down by wilde during his many redrafts of the text
now freed from living up to any drama more serious than conversation wilde could now amuse himself to a fuller extent with quips bons @-@ mots epigrams and repartee that really had little to do with the business at hand
the genre of the importance of being earnest has been deeply debated by scholars and critics alike who have placed the play within a wide variety of genres ranging from parody to satire
in his critique of wilde foster argues that the play creates a world where “ real values are inverted and reason and unreason are interchanged
similarly wilde 's use of dialogue mocks the upper classes of victorian england lending the play a satirical tone
reinhart further stipulates that the use of farcical humour to mock the upper classes merits the play both as satire and as drama
after two years in prison with hard labour wilde went into exile in paris sick and depressed his reputation destroyed in england
in <year> when no @-@ one else would leonard smithers agreed with wilde to publish the two final plays
wilde proved to be a diligent reviser sending detailed instructions on stage directions character listings and the presentation of the book and insisting that a playbill from the first performance be reproduced inside
ellmann argues that the proofs show a man very much in command of himself and of the play
wilde 's name did not appear on the cover it was by the author of lady windermere 's fan
his return to work was brief though as he refused to write anything else i can write but have lost the joy of writing
on <num> october <year> a first edition number <num> of <num> @,@ <num> was discovered inside a handbag in an oxfam shop in nantwich cheshire
staff were unable to trace the donor

the easiest case of a suitable translation of the pun perpetuating its sense and meaning may have been its translation into german
since english and german are closely related languages german provides an equivalent adjective ernst and also a matching masculine proper name ernst
the meaning and tenor of the wordplay are exactly the same
yet there are many different possible titles in german mostly concerning sentence structure
the two most common ones are bunbury oder ernst ernst sein ist alles and bunbury oder wie wichtig es ist ernst ernst zu sein
in a study of italian translations adrian pablé found thirteen different versions using eight titles
since wordplay is often unique to the language in question translators are faced with a choice of either staying faithful to the original — in this case the english adjective and virtue earnest — or creating a similar pun in their own language
four main strategies have been used by translators
the first leaves all characters names unchanged and in their original spelling thus the name is respected and readers reminded of the original cultural setting but the liveliness of the pun is lost
eva malagoli varied this source @-@ oriented approach by using both the english christian names and the adjective earnest thus preserving the pun and the english character of the play but possibly straining an italian reader
a third group of translators replaced ernest with a name that also represents a virtue in the target language favouring transparency for readers in translation over fidelity to the original
for instance in italian these versions variously call the play l 'importanza di essere franco severo fedele the given names being respectively the values of honesty propriety and loyalty
french offers a closer pun constant is both a first name and the quality of steadfastness so the play is commonly known as de l 'importance d 'être constant though jean anouilh translated the play under the title il est important d 'être aimé aimé is a name which also means beloved
these translators differ in their attitude to the original english honorific titles some change them all or none but most leave a mix partially as a compensation for the added loss of englishness
lastly one translation gave the name an italianate touch by rendering it as ernesto this work liberally mixed proper nouns from both languages

mathews joined the royal navy as a cadet at the age of <num> and progressed through the ranks to lieutenant
he was involved with the third anglo @-@ ashanti war of <year> – <num> afterwards being stationed in east africa for the suppression of the slave trade
in <year> he was seconded from the navy to sultan barghash of zanzibar in order to form a european @-@ style army he would remain in the employment of the government of zanzibar for the rest of his life
his army quickly reached <num> @,@ <num> men and was used in several expeditions to suppress the slave trade and rebellions against the zanzibar government
mathews retired from the royal navy in <year> and was appointed brigadier @-@ general of zanzibar
there followed more expeditions to the african mainland including a failed attempt to stop german expansion in east africa
in october <year> mathews was appointed first minister to the zanzibar government a position in which he was irremovable by the sultan
during this time mathews was a keen abolitionist and promoted this cause to the sultans he worked with
this resulted in the prohibiting of the slave trade in zanzibar 's dominions in <year> and the abolition of slavery in <year>
mathews was appointed the british consul @-@ general for east africa in <year> but declined to take up the position remaining in zanzibar instead
mathews and his troops also played a key role in the ending of the anglo @-@ zanzibar war of <year> which erupted out of an attempt to bypass the requirement that new sultans must be vetted by the british consul
during his time as first minister mathews continued to be involved with the military and was part of two large campaigns one to witu and another to mwele
mathews was decorated by several governments receiving appointments as a companion of the order of st michael and st george companion of the order of the bath and as a knight commander of the order of st michael and st george from the british government and membership in the prussian order of the crown
zanzibar also rewarded him and he was a member of the grand order of hamondieh and a first class member of the order of the brilliant star of zanzibar
mathews died of malaria in zanzibar on <num> october <year>
his father captain william matthews was welsh and his mother jane wallis penfold was the daughter of william penfold and sarah gilbert
her sister augusta jane robley née penfold was the author of a famous book about the flora and fauna of madeira which is now in the natural history museum
mathews became a cadet of the royal navy in <year> and was appointed a midshipman on <num> september <year>
from <year> he was stationed in the mediterranean but his first active service was during the third anglo @-@ ashanti war of <year> – <num> where he qualified for the campaign medal
he was promoted to lieutenant on <num> march <year>
on <num> august <year> mathews was posted to hms london a depot ship and the royal navy headquarters for east africa to assist in the suppression of the slave trade in the area
whilst onboard he drilled his own troops captured several slave dhows and was commended for his actions by the admiralty
the army had traditionally been composed entirely of arabs and persians but mathews opened up recruitment to the african majority on the island and had <num> recruits in training by the end of the year
in addition mathews employed some unorthodox recruitment methods such as purchasing slaves from their masters using inmates from the prison and recruiting from africans rescued from the slavers
in june <year> at the instigation of john kirk the explorer and friend of the sultan the british government sent a shipment of <num> modern rifles and ammunition as a gift with which to arm the troops
mathews introduced a new uniform for the troops consisting of a red cap short black jackets and white trousers for the enlisted ranks and dark blue frock coats and trousers with gold and silver lace for the arab officers
the latter was possibly modelled on the royal navy officers uniform with which he was familiar
the army grew quickly by the <num> mathews would command <num> @,@ <num> men his forces eventually numbering <num> @,@ <num> regulars and <num> @,@ <num> irregulars
one of the first tasks for the new army was to suppress the smuggling of slaves from pangani on the mainland to the island of pemba north of zanzibar
the troops completed this mission capturing several slavers and hindering the trade
mathews retired from the royal navy in june <year> and was appointed brigadier @-@ general of zanzibar
in <year> the sultan dispatched a military force under mathews to bring his unruly african mainland territories under control
mathews expedition was initially intended to reach unyanyembe but his men refused to march inland and when made to do so deserted in large numbers
the expedition ended instead at mamboya where a <num> @-@ man garrison was established
this had been reduced to a mere handful of men by the mid @-@ <num> but the expedition proved that the sultan was serious about maintaining control of all of his possessions
mathews men were also involved in several expeditions to halt the land @-@ based slave trade which had developed once the seas became too heavily policed for the traders
in <year> mathews old vessel the hms london was captained by charles j brownrigg
this vessel and her crew made several patrols aimed at hindering the slave trade using smaller steam boats for the actual pursuits and captures
on december <num> <year> they caught up with a slave dhow captained by hindi bin hattam
this dhow had around <num> slaves on board and was transporting them between pemba and zanzibar
captain brownrigg led a boarding party to release the slaves but bin hattam 's men then attacked the sailors killing brownrigg and his party before sailing away
mathews led a force to wete on pemba and after a short battle took a mortally wounded bin hattem prisoner before returning to zanzibar
mathews returned to the african mainland territories once more in <year> when he landed with a force which intended to establish further garrisons there to dissuade german territorial claims
this attempt ultimately failed when five german warships steamed into zanzibar town harbour and threatened the sultan into signing away the territories which would later form german east africa
further territories were ceded to the german east africa company in <year> but unrest amongst the locals against them prevented them from taking control and mathews was dispatched with <num> men to restore order
finding around <num> @,@ <num> people gathered against the german administrators mathews was forced to return with his men to zanzibar
he landed once again with more troops but found himself subject to death threats and that his troops would not obey his orders and so returned again to zanzibar
in this capacity mathews was irremovable by the sultan and answerable only to the sultan and the british consul
his position was so strong that one missionary on the island is quoted as saying that his powers defied analytical examination and that mathews really could say l 'état est moi i am the state
mathews was also known as the strong man of zanzibar
the principal departments of government were mostly run by britons or british indians and mathews approval was required before they could be removed from office
mathews was rewarded by the zanzibar government for his role with his appointment as a first class member of the order of the brilliant star of zanzibar which he was granted licence by queen victoria to accept and wear on <num> may <year>
mathews used his position to suppress slavery in the country and in <year> convinced the sultan to issue a decree purchasing the freedom of all slaves who had taken refuge in his dominions and from <year> the prohibiting the slave trade
on <num> february <year> mathews was appointed her majesty 's commissioner and consul @-@ general to the british sphere of influence in east africa
he never took up the post and instead chose to remain in zanzibar
mathews was rewarded for his service in zanzibar by the british government which appointed him a companion of the order of st michael and st george in <year> and a companion of the order of the bath on <num> may <year>
despite becoming renowned in east africa as a man who ran a fair administration and was strict with criminals unhappiness with effective british rule and his halting of the slave trade led some arabs to petition the sultan for his removal in <year>
in <year> mathews purchased the island of changuu for the government
he intended it to be used as a prison but it never housed prisoners and was instead used to quarantine yellow fever cases before its present use as a conservation area for giant tortoises
mathews was appointed a knight commander of the order of st michael and st george in <year>
he was also awarded membership of the order of the crown by the german government
matters came to a head when khalid bin barghash attempted to take control of the palace in zanzibar town upon the death of his uncle in august <year> despite failing to gain the consent of the british consul there
mathews opposed this succession and with british agreement called up <num> soldiers in an attempt to prevent it
this situation eventually led to the anglo @-@ zanzibar war and mathews with the support of admiral harry rawson and five vessels of the royal navy bombarded the palace and secured the end of khalid 's administration
mathews helped to arrange the succession of a pro @-@ british sultan hamoud bin mohammed as khalid 's successor
mathews continued his reforms after the war abolishing slavery in <year> and establishing new farms to grow produce using western techniques
he was appointed a member of the grand order of hamondieh of zanzibar and was permitted to accept and wear the decoration on <num> august <year>
the initial rebellion in the area had been led by mbaruk bin rashid at gazi which mathews had put down with <num> @,@ <num> men in <year>
however in <year> mbaruk 's nephew mbaruk bin rashid refused to acknowledge the appointment of a new leader at takaungu
this led to open rebellion at konjoro in february of that year when the younger mbaruk attacked zanzibari troops under arthur raikes one of mathews officers
mathews was part of an anglo @-@ zanzibari expedition sent to quell it which consisted of <num> british sailors <num> royal marines <num> sudanese and <num> zanzibari troops
konjoro was destroyed and the leaders fled to gazi where the older mbaruk failed to turn them over
another force under admiral rawson with <num> british marines and sailors was sent after them
this further expedition failed to capture the ringleaders and a third expedition was organised by rawson with <num> sailors <num> marines <num> sudanese and <num> zanzibaris which destroyed mwele
during the latter action mathews was wounded in the shoulder
nine warships and three transports carrying <num> sailors and marines <num> imperial british east africa company ibea indian police <num> zanzibari and <num> sudanese troops were sent defeating the sultan and establishing a british protectorate
the ibea was given control of the area and established a force of <num> indian police to maintain the peace
the police were withdrawn in july <year> following threats of violence from the new sultan of witu oman and another expedition was dispatched to the region
this consisted of three warships hms blanche hms sparrow and the zanzibari ship hhs barawa
the latter carried mathews with <num> askaris and <num> sudanese under brigadier @-@ general hatch of the zanzibar army
mathews and an escort force went to witu where on <num> july they removed the flag of the ibea company and replaced it with the red flag of zanzibar before destroying several villages and causing oman to retreat into the forests
the british troops then withdrew having suffered heavily from malaria but the sudanese and zanzibari troops remained
a further expedition was sent of <num> sailors and <num> other troops but oman died soon after and a more pliable sultan omar bin hamid was appointed to govern on behalf of zanzibar bringing the affair to a close
in return for this action mathews received the british east and west africa campaign medal
his successor as first minister was a

they are known for their hardiness and quiet temperament
the new zealand government strictly controls the population to protect the habitat in which they live which includes several endangered species of plants
the varying heritage gives the breed a wide range of heights body patterns and colours
they are usually well @-@ muscled sure @-@ footed and tough
horses were first reported in the kaimanawa range in <year> although the first horses had been brought into new zealand in <year>
the feral herds grew as horses escaped and were released from sheep stations and cavalry bases
members of the herd were recaptured by locals for use as riding horses as well as being caught for their meat hair and hides
the herd declined as large scale farming and forestry operations encroached on their ranges and only around <num> horses were known to exist by <year>
the kaimanawa herd was protected by the new zealand government in <year> and there were <num> @,@ <num> horses in the herd by <year>
a small mostly unmanaged population also exists on the aupouri peninsula at the northern tip of the north island
roundups have been carried out annually since <year> to manage the size of the herd removing around <num> @,@ <num> horses altogether
the kaimanawa population is listed as a herd of special genetic value by the united nations food and agricultural organization and several studies have been conducted on the herd dynamics and habits of the breed
the kaimanawa breed descended from domestic horses that were released in the late <num> century and early <num> century in the middle of the north island around the kaimanawa mountains
between <year> and <year> major george gwavas carlyon imported exmoor ponies to hawkes bay and crossed them with local stock to produce the carlyon pony
these carlyon ponies were later crossed with two welsh stallions kinarth caesar and comet imported by sir donald mclean and a breed known as the comet resulted
at some point during the <num> mclean released a comet stallion and several mares on the kaingaroa plains and the bloodline apparently became part of the wild kaimanawa population
other horses were added to the bloodline through escapes and releases from local sheep stations and from cavalry units at waiouru that were threatened with a strangles epidemic
it is also thought that in the <num> nicholas koreneff released an arabian stallion into the argo valley region
throughout the <num> and <num> centuries horses were harvested from the feral herds and used as riding and stock horses as well as being used for their meat hair and hides
originally there were many herds that roamed land owned by the british crown and the native māori but many were eradicated with the intensification of large scale farming and forestry operations combined with increased mechanization that decreased the need for stock horses
kaimanawa horses today have the highest amount of genetic similarity with the thoroughbred and other thoroughbred cross breeds
pressure from land development and an encroaching human population reduced the range and the number of the kaimanawa horses and in <year> it was found that only about <num> horses remained
starting in <year> the kaimanawa population range size and herd movements began to be officially measured and a protected area was formed for the breed in the waiouru military training area
legislative protection was similar to the kiwi and other native species
there was a rapid increase in the herd size following the protection of the breed and <num> @,@ <num> horses were known to exist in the area by <year>
there is also a small population of horses on the aupouri peninsula at the northern tip of the north island which is mostly unmanaged by the new zealand government
in <year> the kaimanawa herds were the focus of a novel called kaimanawa princess by dianne haworth
the kaimanawa breed varies widely in general appearance with heights ranging between <num>
<num> and <num> hands <num> and <num> inches <num> and <num> cm high
any coat colour or pattern marking is acceptable
they are usually well @-@ muscled
their feral way of life has given them the ability to adapt quickly and live on very little and they are usually sure @-@ footed and tough
they have a medium @-@ sized head in good proportion to their body with wide variation in shape due to the different conformation of their ancestors
kaimanawa horses have a short deep neck with a thick throat area straight shoulders a deep girth and a short to medium back
the hindquarters vary from sloping to well @-@ rounded
the legs are long and well @-@ muscled with strong hooves and hind hooves that are generally smaller than the front ones
all horses are considered to age a year on the first of august regardless of their actual foaling date
a draft plan was made available to the public for comment in <year> and the public made it clear that it objected to herd reduction through shooting from helicopters and instead favored the horses remaining alive after being removed from the herd
however core animal welfare groups felt that shooting was the most humane option
trial musters were conducted in <year> <year> and <year> and were successful although costly and with a limited demand for the captured horses
in <year> a working party was established to look at the management of the kaimanawa herd
they aimed to decide which organization was in charge of long term management to ensure that the treatment of horses is humane to preserve and control the best attributes of the herds and to eliminate the impacts of the herds on other conservation priorities
goals included ensuring the welfare of the horses protecting natural ecosystems and features that the kaimanawa herd may impact and keeping the herd at a sustainable level
ecological objectives included ensuring that kaimanawa horse does not adversely affect endangered rare and biogeographically significant plants ensuring that the herd does not further degrade the ecosystems in which it lives and preventing the herd from spreading into the kaimanawa forest park and the tongariro national park
herd objectives included ensuring that the public was safe from roaming horses while still allowing and improving public access to the herd and ensuring humane treatment of the horses reducing conflict between the herd and other ecological values and land uses and ensuring that the herd is contained to a population that is tolerated by the ecosystems in which they live while still maintaining a minimum effective population that is in general free ranging
the department of conservation has since <year> carried out annual culls and muster of kaimanawas to keep the herd population around a target level of <num> horses
the target will be reduced to <num> horses in stages starting in <year>
these horses are either taken directly to slaughter or are placed at holding farms for later slaughter or adoption by private homes
a main reason for the strict population control is to protect the habitat in which they live
this habitat includes <num> plant species listed as endangered which the kaimanawa may endanger further through trampling and overgrazing
these plants include herbs grasses sedges flowers and mistletoes among these are deschampsia caespitosa a very rare tussock grass peraxilla tetrapetala a vulnerable mistletoe and libertia peregrinans a possibly locally extinct sand iris
the <year> culling of the population removed <num> horses from the herd the largest culling since the beginning of the program with homes found for <num> of the horses removed
conservation of these horses is an important matter to the public and between <year> and <year> the new zealand minister for conservation received more public comments on the kaimanawa horse than on any other subject
in this period more than <num> @,@ <num> requests for information and letters were received with public interest peaking in <year> and <year>
this was due to a program of population reduction by shooting scheduled to begin implementation in <year> due to public opposition the shooting was cancelled and a large scale muster and adoption program began in <year>
in <year> around <num> @,@ <num> horses were removed from the range and adopted reducing the main herd to around <num> and reducing their range to around <num> @,@ <num> ha from around <num> @,@ <num>
since <year> a total of around <num> @,@ <num> horses have been removed from the range
only one injury resulting in the death of a horse is known to have occurred
the united nations food and agricultural organization lists the kaimanawa horses as a herd of special genetic value that can be compared with other groups of feral horses such as new forest ponies assateague ponies wild mustangs and with free @-@ living zebras
kaimanawas are of special value because of their low rate of interaction with humans
this lack of interaction may result in a herd with more wild and fewer domestic characteristics which is of special interest to researchers
between <year> and <year> students from massey university studied a population of around <num> kaimanawa horses to learn their habits and herd dynamics
a <year> study found that although sometimes there are more than two stallions in kaimanawa horse herds only the two stallions highest in the herd hierarchy mate with the herd females
this differs from other feral horse herds some of which have only one stallion that mates with mares while others have several stallions that sire foals

although literary works on architecture existed beforehand architectural writing blossomed during the song dynasty maturing into a more professional form that described dimensions and working materials in a concise organized manner
in addition to the examples still standing depictions in song artwork architectural drawings and illustrations in published books all aid modern historians in understanding the architecture of the period
the professions of architect master craftsman carpenter and structural engineer did not have the high status of the confucian scholar @-@ officials during the dynastic era
architectural knowledge had been passed down orally for thousands of years usually from craftsman fathers to their sons
there were also government agencies and schools for construction building and engineering
the song dynasty 's building manuals aided not only the various private workshops but also the craftsmen employed by the central government
the outer city of ancient bianjing was built during the reign of emperor shenzong to a rectangular plan almost square in proportions about <num> km <num>
<num> mi from north to south and <num> km <num>
<num> mi from west to east
the south wall had three gates with nanxun gate in the center chenzhou gate to the east and dailou gate to the west
the other walls had four gates each in the east wall were dongshui gate at the southern end xinsong gate xinchao gate and north @-@ east water gate in the west wall xinzheng gate west water gate wansheng gate and guzi gate and in the north wall chenqiao gate at the eastern end fengqiu gate new wild jujube gate and weizhou gate
the gates in the center of each of the four sides were reserved for the emperor these gates had straight passages and only two sets of doors while the other city gates had zigzag passages and were guarded by three sets of doors
the song artist zhang zeduan 's painting along the river during the qingming festival depicts the dongshui gate in detail the building on top had a five @-@ ridged roof with a shallow slope in the song dynasty style supported prominently by two sets of brackets dougong
the lower bracket assembly rested on the city gate to form a wooden foundation while the upper assembly supported the roof similar to the dougong in an extant song building the goddess temple in taiyuan
this method of using bracket assemblies to support superstructure was specified in li jie 's <num> @-@ century building manual yingzao fashi as pingzuo literally flat base
the city wall itself was built with rammed earth a technique also detailed in yingzao fashi vol
iii standards for moat stronghold and masonry work foundation for every square chi apply two dan of earth on top of it lay a mixture of broken brick tile and crushed stones also two dan
for every five @-@ cun layer of earth two men standing face to face should tamp six times with pestles each man pounding three times on a dent then tamp four times on each dent two men again standing face to face each pounding twice on the same dent then tamp two more times each man pounding once
following this tamp the surface with pestles or stamp with feet randomly to even out the surface
every five @-@ cun layer of earth should be compressed to three cun every three @-@ cun layer of brick and stone to one and a half cun
rammed @-@ earth walls during this time were tapered the thickness of the wall is greatest at the base and decreases steadily with increasing height as detailed in li jie 's book
during the song dynasty the city of bianjing had three enclosures the outer city wall the inner city wall and the palace at the center
the inner city was rectangular with three doors on each side
the palace enclosure was also rectangular with a watch tower on each of the four corners
it had four main gates xihua gate to the west donghua gate to the east gongchen gate to the north and xuande gate also known as duan gate or xuandelou at the south
xuande gate had five @-@ paneled doors painted red and decorated with gold tacks its walls were lavishly decorated with dragon phoenix and floating @-@ cloud patterns to match the carved beams painted rafters and glazed @-@ tile roof
there were also two glazed dragons each biting an end of the rooftop ridge its tail pointing to the sky
the symbolic function of these chi wei was explained in yingzao fashi there is a dragon in the east sea whose tail wei is similar to that of a sparrow @-@ hawk chi it stirs up waves and causes rainfall so people put its likeness on the rooftop to prevent fire
however they misnamed it sparrow @-@ hawk tail chi wei
running southward from xuande gate was the imperial boulevard about two hundred paces wide with the imperial corridors on either side
merchants opened shops in the corridors until <num> when they were banned
two rows of black fencing were placed at the center of the boulevard as a barrier to pedestrians and carriages
along the inner sides of the fences ran the brick @-@ lined imperial water furrows filled with lotus
about <num> m <num> @,@ <num> ft south from xuande gate the bian river intercepted the imperial boulevard which crossed it over the stone zhou bridge balustraded and flat @-@ decked
this design of a boulevard with a stone bridge crossing a river was later imitated in the forbidden city
during spring and summer mingled peach plum pear and apricot trees adorned the banks of the bian with a variety of flowers
during the southern and northern dynasties period the distinctive chinese pagoda was developed its predecessors being the tall watch towers and towering residential apartments of the han dynasty as inferred from models in han @-@ era tombs
during the sui <num> – <num> and tang <num> – <num> periods chinese pagodas were developed from purely wooden structures to use articulated stone and brick which could more easily survive fires caused by lightning or arson and were less susceptible to decay
the earliest brick pagoda that remains extant is the songyue pagoda built in <num> and a typical example of a tang @-@ era stone pagoda is the giant wild goose pagoda constructed in <num>
although buddhist influences on china waned after the late tang period numerous buddhist pagoda towers were built during the song dynasty
tall chinese pagodas were often built in the countryside rather than within a city 's walls largely to avoid competition with the cosmic @-@ imperial authority embodied in the cities drum- and gate @-@ towers
the giant wild goose pagoda built in a city ward of what was southeastern chang 'an is among the exceptions
the iron pagoda of youguo temple in kaifeng earned it name from the iron @-@ grey color of the glazed bricks forming the tower
originally built of wood by the architect yu hao it was struck by lightning and burned down in <num> during the northern song period
in <num> the pagoda was rebuilt as it appears today under the order of emperor renzong of song
this <num> @-@ story pagoda structured on an octagonal base is <num>
<num> meters <num>
<num> ft tall
its glazed tile bricks feature carved artwork of dancing figures solemn ministers and buddhist themes see gallery below
the period also featured true cast @-@ iron pagodas such as the iron pagoda of yuquan temple jade springs temple dangyang hubei province
built in <num> it incorporates <num> @,@ <num> kg <num> @,@ <num> lb of cast iron and stands <num>
<num> m <num>
<num> ft tall
imitating contemporary wooden stone and brick pagodas the pagoda features sloping eaves and an octagonal base
another iron pagoda was constructed in <num> jining shandong and was cast layer by layer in octagonal sections standing <num> feet high
several such cast iron pagodas exist in china today
the liuhe pagoda or six harmonies pagoda is another example of song @-@ era pagoda architecture
it is located in the southern song capital of hangzhou in zhejiang province at the foot of yuelun hill facing the qiantang river
although the original was destroyed in <num> the current tower was erected in <num> and fully restored by <num>
it stands <num>
<num> m <num>
<num> ft tall and was constructed from a red brick frame with <num> stages of wooden eaves
because of its size the pagoda served as a permanent lighthouse to aid sailors at night as described in hangzhou fu zhi
the zhengjue temple pagoda in pengxian county of sichuan province near chengdu is a brick pagoda that was built between <num> and <num> according to inscriptions running along its first storey
it has a square base on a sumeru pedestal thirteen stories totaling <num> m <num> ft in height and multiple layers of eaves similar in style to the earlier tang pagodas of chang 'an the giant wild goose pagoda and the small wild goose pagoda
wood @-@ and @-@ brick hybrid pagodas were also built
the first four floors of the octagonal <num> m <num> ft lingxiao pagoda of <num> are brick with wooden eaves while from the fifth floor up it is entirely made of wood
even pagodas made of stone or brick featured architectural elements that were typical of chinese wooden buildings for example the pizhi pagoda built from <num> to <num> uses the dougong brackets typical of wooden architecture to hold up pent shingled roofs and tiers
both of these pagodas feature interior staircases although the lingxiao pagoda 's only reaches to the fourth floor and the pizhi pagoda 's to the fifth
however the pizhi pagoda features winding exterior stairs that provide access to the ninth and topmost floor
although the pagoda of fogong temple is the tallest extant wooden pagoda the tallest chinese pagoda built in the dynastic era that remains standing is the liaodi pagoda
completed in <num> it is <num> meters <num> ft tall with an octagonal base on a large platform surpassing the <num> @-@ meter <num> ft qianxun pagoda which had held the record since its construction in the <num> century by the kingdom of dali
although the liaodi pagoda served its religious purpose as a buddhist landmark in the kaiyuan monastery of ding county hebei province its great height gave it another valuable function as a military watch tower that was used to observe movements of the liao enemy
beside their utility in surveillance pagoda towers could also serve as astronomical observatories one such is the gaocheng astronomical observatory built in <num> and still standing today
often the land already contained buildings that could be re @-@ purposed for religions use
the fei 費 family of the town of jinze located just west of shanghai converted a mansion on their property into a buddhist sutra @-@ recitiation hall and later built several other religious buildings around the hall
this spurred a boom in temple construction in the area causing jinze to become a major center of the white lotus sect of buddhism which in turn spurred the construction of more temples and lead the town to become a significant location within the song
the nearby town of nanxiang gained prominence shortly after the fall of the song in large part to the construction of temples and other religious buildings which spanned the entire song empire
apart from stimulating the development of urban areas temples and religious buildings featured a number of unique aesthetic and structural features
the temple of the saintly mother 圣母殿 and the hall of sacrifice of the jin temple 晋祠 located in a southeastern suburb of taiyuan city shanxi province are extant examples of early song architecture
the temple of the saintly mother is the main building of the jin temple first built in the period between <num> and <num> and renovated in <num>
it has a double @-@ eaved roof with nine ridges and two dragon @-@ heads with wide @-@ open jaws biting the ends of the main ridge
the roof is supported by massive dougong brackets corresponding to drawings in yingzao fashi
the eaves of the temple of the saintly mother curve upward slightly at each end a characteristic of song architecture
the columns of the façade decorated with dragons that coil around the shafts become progressively taller with increasing distance to either side of the central pair
the building has a porch around it the sole example of such a structure another unique feature of the site is a cross @-@ shaped bridge that leads to the goddess temple
the trinity hall of xuan miao temple 玄妙观 situated in the heart of suzhou city is another example of song architecture
in <year> it was established as a national heritage site by the chinese government
the jingling palace 景灵宫 jingling gong a temple to the legendary yellow emperor located near modern @-@ day qufu was built in the <num> century
it was subsequently destroyed near the end of the yuan dynasty
however several other structures in shou qiu the complex that jingling palace was situated in remain intact
two giant tortoise @-@ borne steles flank what was the entrance to the palace
one of the two steles the stele of the sorrow of <num> @,@ <num> is at <num> meters <num> ft high the tallest unmarked stele in the country
a large pyramid constructed of rounded stone blocks the symbolic tomb of the yellow emperor 's son shaohao is located outside the shou qiu complex
another important large tortoise @-@ borne stele of the same period has been preserved at the dai miao of mount tai
during the song dynasty large trestle bridges were constructed such as that built by zhang zhongyan in <num>
there were also large bridges made entirely of stone like the ba zi bridge of shaoxing built in <num> and still standing today
bridges with pavilions crowning their central spans were often featured in such paintings as the landscapes of xia gui <num> – <num>
long covered corridor bridges like the <num> @-@ century rainbow bridge in wuyuan jiangxi province which has wide stone @-@ based piers and a wooden superstructure were also built
while serving as an administrator for hangzhou the poet su shi <num> – <num> had a large pedestrian causeway built across the west lake which still bears his name sudi 蘇堤
in <num> the taoist traveler qiu changchun visited genghis khan in samarkand describing various chinese bridges encountered on the way there through the tian shan mountains east of yining
the historian joseph needham quotes him as saying the road had no less than <num> timber bridges of such width that two carts can drive over them side by side
it had been built by chang jung zhang rong and the other engineers of the chagatai some years before
the wooden trestles of chinese bridges from the − <num> century bc onwards were no doubt similar to those supposed to have been employed in julius caesar 's bridge of − <num> bc across the rhine or drawn by leonardo or found in use in africa
but where in <num> century ad europe could a two @-@ lane highway like chang jung 's have been found in fujian province enormous beam bridges were built during the song dynasty
some of these were as long as <num> @,@ <num> m <num> @,@ <num> ft with individual spans of up to <num> m <num> ft in length their construction necessitated moving massive stones of <num> t <num> @,@ <num> kg
no names of the engineers were recorded or appear in the inscriptions on the bridges which give only the names of local officials who sponsored them and oversaw their construction and repair
however there might have been an engineering school in fujian headed by a prominent engineer known as cai xiang <num> – <num> who had risen to the position of governmental prefect in fujian
between <num> and <num> he planned and supervised the construction of the large wanan bridge once called the luoyang bridge near quanzhou on the border of the present @-@ day luojiang district and huai 'an county
this bridge a stone structure similar to a number of other bridges found in fujian still stands and features ship @-@ like piers bound to their bases using mucilage from oysters as an adhesive
it is <num> m <num> @,@ <num> ft in length <num> m <num> ft in width and <num> m <num> ft in height
another famous bridge near quanzhou the anping bridge was constructed between <num> and <num>
other examples of song bridges include guyue bridge a stone arch bridge in yiwu zhejiang province
the bridge was built in <num> the sixth year of the jiading era in the southern song dynasty
song @-@ era pontoon bridges include the dongjin bridge <num> m <num> ⁄ <num> mi long which may still be seen today
the complex extends approximately <num> km <num>
<num> mi from east to west and <num> km <num>
<num> mi from north to south
the construction of the complex began in <num> ad during the reign of the first song ruler emperor taizu of song whose father is also buried at the site
the only northern song emperors not buried there are emperor huizong of song and emperor qinzong of song who died in captivity after the jurchen invasion of northern china in <num>
lining the spirit ways of the tomb complex are hundreds of song sculptures and statues of tigers rams lions horses with grooms horned beasts and mythical creatures government officials military generals foreign ambassadors and others featured in an enormous display of song @-@ era artwork
the layout and style of the song tombs resemble those found in the contemporary tangut kingdom of the western xia which also had an auxiliary burial site associated with each tomb
at the center of each burial site is a truncated pyramidal tomb each having once been guarded by a four @-@ walled enclosure with four centered gates and four corner towers
about <num> km <num> mi from gongxian is the baisha tomb which contains elaborate facsimiles in brick of chinese timber frame construction from door lintels to pillars and pedestals to bracket sets that adorn interior walls
the baisha tomb has two large separate chambers with conical ceilings a large staircase leads down to the entrance doors of the subterranean tomb
one of the most definitive works however was the earlier mu jing timberwork manual ascribed to yu hao and written sometime between <num> and <num>
yu hao was responsible for the construction of a wooden pagoda tower in kaifeng which was destroyed by lightning and replaced by the brick iron pagoda soon after
in his time books on architecture were still considered a lowly scholarly achievement due to the craft 's status so mu jing was not even recorded in the official court bibliography
although the book itself was lost to history the scientist and statesman shen kuo wrote of yu 's work extensively in his dream pool essays of <num> praising it as a work of architectural genius saying that no one in his own time could reproduce such a work
shen kuo singled out among other passages a scene in which yu hao gives advice to another artisan @-@ architect about slanting struts in order to brace a pagoda against the wind and a passage in which yu hao describes the three sections of a building the area above the crossbeams the area above ground and the foundation and then proceeds to provide proportional ratios and construction techniques for each section
several years later li jie 李誡 <num> – <num> published yingzao fashi treatise on architectural methods or state building standards
although similar books came before it such as yingshan ling national building law of the early tang dynasty <num> – <num> li 's book is the earliest technical manual on chinese architecture to have survived in full
li completed the book in <num> and presented it to emperor zhezong of song in the last year of his reign
his successor emperor huizong of song had li 's treatise officially published three years later in <num> for the benefit of foremen architects and literate craftsmen
the book was intended to provide standard regulations to not only the engineering agencies of the central government but also the many workshops and artisan families throughout china who could benefit from using a well @-@ written government manual on building practices
yingzao fashi included building codes and regulations accounting information descriptions of construction materials and classification of crafts
in its <num> chapters the book outlined units of measurement and the construction of moats fortifications stonework and woodwork
for the latter it included specifications for making bracketing units with inclined arms and joints for columns and beams
it also provided specifications for wood carving drilling sawing bamboo work tiling wall building and decoration
the book contained recipes for decorative paints glazes and coatings also listing proportions for mixing mortars used in masonry
brickwork and manufacture of glazed tiles illustrating practices and standards with drawings
his book outlined structural carpentry in great detail providing standard dimensional measurements for all components used
here he developed a standard eight @-@ grade system for sizing timber elements known as the cai @-@ fen system of units which could be universally applied in buildings
about <num> of li jie 's book was derived from pre @-@ existing written material on architecture while the majority of the book documented the inherited traditions of craftsmen and architects
the yingzao fashi provided a full glossary of technical terms that included mathematical formulae building proportions and construction techniques and discussed the implications of the local topography for construction at a particular site
he also estimated the monetary costs of hiring laborers of different skill levels from various crafts on the basis of a day 's work in addition to the price of the materials they would need and according to the season in which they were to be employed
released by xl recordings and produced by nick franglen the album generated two charting singles in the uk space walk and nice weather for ducks the latter has often been called the album 's stand @-@ out track
the album which is built around a mix of organic instrumentation and idiosyncratic samples was met with largely positive reviews by music critics although it was somewhat critiqued due to its near @-@ constant mellowness
in the united kingdom lost horizons peaked at number <num> on the official albums chart whereas in the united states it peaked at number <num> on billboard 's top electronic albums component chart
the album 's two singles space walk and nice weather for ducks were also successful peaking on the uk singles chart at number <num> and <num> respectively
the album was nominated for the mercury music prize in <year> was eventually certified gold by the british phonographic industry for shipments exceeding <num> @,@ <num> copies
a falsetto doo @-@ doo chorus
overlaying the music is a voiceover courtesy of english actor john standing that lists the basic elements that make up the world ash metal water wood fire and eventually later in the song sky
the second track space walk is set to a recording of ed white 's <year> space walk on the gemini <num> mission
franglen and deakin chose to use the sample after listening to an album called flight to the moon <year> the two were struck by how moving and emotive many of the tracks were
deakin later said one small step leaves me cold because it was so obviously scripted
but the spacewalk … even after hearing it so many times it 's so vivid
ramblin man features a conversation between an interviewer the voice of michael deakin — father of lemon jelly 's fred deakin and john the ramblin man the voice of standing during which he lists various places from around the world ranging from from small sussex villages to major world capitals
when listed in the order in which the locations are narrated the message bagpuss sees all things is spelled out midway through the song from brixton at four minutes ten seconds to san josé at four minutes <num> seconds using the first letter of each location
the fourth track return to patagonia features several jazz @-@ inspired elements
the song nice weather for ducks is built around a sample inspired by john langstaff 's song all the ducks
this song was based on the popular dutch children 's song alle eendjes zwemmen in het water translated all the ducks are swimming in the water
franglen later said that he and deakin were drawn to langstaff 's recording because it had a gentle madness to it slightly unhinged
the duo had attempted to clear langstaff 's version for sampling but were unable to
in the end they had enn reitel re @-@ record the vocal snippet
franglen while noting that reitel 's performance was good said that once the sample was re @-@ recorded its edge disappeared
experimental number <num> arguably the album 's darkest track features a faux field recording of a doctor documenting the side effects of an unnamed drug administered to a patient the recording tells how the patient progresses from normalcy to an overwhelming sense of well @-@ being and euphoria before eventually expiring
the album closes with the curse of ka 'zar which features a two @-@ part harmony chorus and jazzy drum loop
stuart mason of allmusic called the album a delightful but slightly faceless blend of lounge pop subtle beats found sound with mellow jazz influences
a reviewer for entertainment
ie praised the band for approaching electronica from a new angle writing this london @-@ based duo employ playschool pianos acoustic guitars and sprightly beats to create laid @-@ back instrumentals guaranteed to sooth even the most restless of souls

what really marks lemon jelly as exciting new talents is their quirky sense of humour which they use to brighten up their sound with skilful sic use of nursery rhymes brass bands and offbeat samples
pascal wyse of the guardian wrote everything is approachable and purely crafted but lost horizons cheats banality with some choice quirks magnificent seven strings astronauts chatting panoramic sound effects
chris dahlen of pitchfork media felt that the album was a little too saccharine at times but that it is the perfect disc to throw on after your four @-@ disc ultrachill dub groove mix has put the whole party to sleep
it 's like eight flavors of ribbon candy beach balls hitting the ground like hail and a big plastic clown face that blows helium
many reviews singled out nice weather for ducks as the album 's stand @-@ out track
mason selected the dreamy acoustic guitar @-@ based song as one of the album 's highlights in his review
dahlen described it as the most likeable on the album and concluded that it is a happy @-@ slappy lollipop of a song that nicely sums this record up sunny bright and vaguely irritating
wysel wrote when the flugelhorn arrives on nice weather for ducks it is impossible to believe there is any evil in the world
conversely several critics felt that experiment number six did not fit with the mood of the rest of the album
wysel called it a pool of darkness that comes as quite a shock
dahlen felt that the song is is the only break in the album 's mood
while he enjoyed the song 's concept calling it so different and sinister that it 's more intriguing than the rest of the album he felt that it was annoyingly displaced
hermann on the other hand called the track clever and spooky with music
so well crafted that the concept works
in the us it peaked at number <num> on the billboard top electronic albums chart
in both cases it was the first lemon jelly album to do so
the album 's two singles space walk and nice weather for ducks also managed to chart on the uk singles chart at number <num> and <num> respectively
again this was a first for the band
on <num> december <year> the album was certified silver
almost six months later on <num> july <year> it was certified gold denoting shipments of over <num> @,@ <num>
in <year> the album was nominated for a mercury music prize although the album lost to dizzee rascal 's boy in da corner
it was built in late <year> by the astra all scale tomographic reconstruction antwerp group of researchers of the ibbt interdisciplinary institute for broadband technology visionlab at the university of antwerp and by belgian computer shop tones in collaboration with asus a taiwanese multinational computer product manufacturer as the successor to the fastra i built in <year>
the fastra ii was determined to be over three times faster than the fastra i which in turn was slightly faster than a <num> @-@ core cluster
however because of the number of gpus in the computer the system initially suffered from several issues like the system refusing to reboot and overheating due to a lack of space between the video cards
unlike other modern supercomputers such as the cray jaguar and the ibm roadrunner which cost millions of euros the fastra ii only uses consumer hardware costing € <num> @,@ <num> in total
the fastra ii 's predecessor the fastra i has <num> dual @-@ gpu geforce <num> gx2 video cards for a total of <num> gpus
at that time the astra group needed a motherboard that had four pci express x16 slots with double @-@ spacing between each of them
the only such motherboard the astra group could find at that time was the msi k9a2 platinum which has four such slots
in <year> the asus p6t7 ws supercomputer motherboard which the fastra ii uses was released which has seven pci express x16 slots
the fastra ii has six faster dual @-@ gpu geforce gtx <num> video cards and a single @-@ gpu geforce gtx <num> for a total of <num> gpus
in the fastra ii the gpus mainly perform tomographic reconstruction
the technique which allows gpus to perform general @-@ purpose tasks like this outside of gaming instead of cpus is called gpgpu general @-@ purpose computing on graphics processing units
overheating caused by the lack of space between the video cards forces researchers using the fastra ii to keep the side panel door open so that the video cards can get regular air decreasing the overall temperature inside the case
due to the number of gpus in the system its initial boot was unsuccessful
this was because its motherboard uses a <num> bit bios which only had approximately <num> gb of address space for the video cards
however asus managed to provide them a specialized bios that entirely skipped the address space allocation of the gtx <num> video cards
the bios @-@ replacement coreboot was not tested
all seven pci express x16 slots in the asus p6t7 motherboard were used in the building of the fastra ii computer
however the video cards in the fastra ii are wide enough to require two such slots each
to solve this issue the researchers came up with flexible pci express cables and tones developed a custom cage which allowed the video cards to suspend over the motherboard
the motherboard in the fastra ii was at that time the only workstation motherboard that had seven full @-@ sized pci express x16 slots
the memory modules were initially six <num> gb modules but were later upgraded to <num> gb each for a total of <num> gb
instead of an eighth dual @-@ gpu video card the single @-@ gpu gtx <num> is in the computer because out of all the video cards in the fastra ii the gtx <num> is the only one the fastra ii 's bios can fully initialize
the total amount of gpus is <num>
the video cards together bring <num> teraflops of computing power
four of the six gtx <num> video cards have <num> pcbs while the other two have only <num> pcb
according to the benchmarks on its official website the fastra ii is faster and more power efficient than its competitors including the fastra i and the tesla c1060 video card
the benchmarks were performed on the fastra ii the fastra i a <num> @-@ core cluster consisting of opteron cpus an nvidia tesla c1060 workstation card on an intel core i7 <num> cpu and on an intel core i7 <num> cpu itself
the fastra ii is over three times faster than the fastra i in ct slice reconstruction speed
although the fastra ii consumes more power than the fastra i it 's nearly <num> times as energy efficient as the fastra i and over <num> times as energy efficient as the <num> @-@ core cluster
the video cards run at <num> degrees celsius when idle and at <num> degrees celsius at full load
the fastra ii received a positive public impression
techie
com called it the world 's most powerful desktop @-@ sized supercomputer describing it as a computer with so much power in such a small space
itech news net called it the most powerful desktop supercomputer
fastra ii relies on nvidia 's scalable link interface sli and is therefore limited to the number of gpus supported by it and also by the vendor respectively the free and open @-@ source device drivers
the fastra ii 's motherboard is designed for workstations and it is mainly being used in hospitals for medical imaging
it remains to be seen whether another fastra featuring nvlink first available with pascal @-@ based gpus will be build

he called this episode a weak link
the deepwater field defined as water depth <num> @,@ <num> to <num> @,@ <num> feet <num> to <num> @,@ <num> m was discovered in september <year> and it is operated by bp
described as a giant find it is estimated to contain <num> to <num> billion barrels <num> × <num> <num> to <num> × <num> <num> <num> of oil in place
although bp states it is too early to be sure of the size – a huge field is usually considered to contain <num> million barrels <num> × <num> <num> <num>
it required the drilling of a <num> @,@ <num> m <num> @,@ <num> ft deep well under <num> @,@ <num> m <num> @,@ <num> ft of water making it one of the deepest wells ever drilled at the time of discovery
tiber is only the <num> lower tertiary well to date and drilling in these formations is in its infancy
the oil from tiber is light crude and early estimates of recoverable reserves are around <num> – <num> recovery suggesting figures of around <num> to <num> million barrels <num> × <num> <num> to <num> × <num> <num> <num> of reserves
sources such as bloomberg suggest caution warning that the find is technically complex and potentially could take <num> – <num> years to produce oil or be lower yield <num> – <num> based on rates talked about at nearby kaskida oil field bp 's previous giant find <year> <num> mi <num> km away
the commercial prospects of the field have not yet been evaluated
lower tertiary rock formations are some of the oldest and most technically challenging offshore rock formations currently drilled for oil dating to between <num> and <num> million years ago
the plan of exploration was filed in june <year>
tiber was initially drilled by transocean 's fifth @-@ generation dynamic positioned semi @-@ submersible oil rig deepwater horizon with exploratory drilling commencing around march <year> slightly delayed from the planned date of september <year>
much of the deeper gulf reserves are buried under salt accumulations thousands of feet thick which present a problem for seismic exploration
bp had previously developed exploration techniques to bypass this difficulty
oil was located at multiple levels
the field was announced on september <num> <year> and bp shares rose <num>
<num> percent on the news
with tiber joining at least ten other successful lower tertiary explorations in the area analysts viewed the announcement as a sign for optimism and a harbinger of renewed interest in and production from the offshore gulf of mexico
at least two rigs that might otherwise have been used for developing tiber are also in use on the relief wells for the ruptured well
the action was the culmination of a campaign that had criss @-@ crossed the bay of biscay over the previous month in which both sides had captured numerous merchant ships and minor warships and had engaged in two partial but inconclusive fleet actions
the british channel fleet under admiral lord howe attempted to prevent the passage of a vital french grain convoy from the united states which was protected by the french atlantic fleet commanded by rear @-@ admiral villaret @-@ joyeuse
the two forces clashed in the atlantic ocean some <num> nautical miles <num> km west of the french island of ushant on <num> june <year>
during the battle howe defied naval convention by ordering his fleet to turn towards the french and for each of his vessels to rake and engage their immediate opponent
this unexpected order was not understood by all of his captains and as a result his attack was more piecemeal than he intended
nevertheless his ships inflicted a severe tactical defeat on the french fleet
in the aftermath of the battle both fleets were left shattered in no condition for further combat howe and villaret returned to their home ports
despite losing seven of his ships of the line villaret had bought enough time for the french grain convoy to reach safety unimpeded by howe 's fleet securing a strategic success
however he was also forced to withdraw his battle fleet back to port leaving the british free to conduct a campaign of blockade for the remainder of the war
in the immediate aftermath both sides claimed victory and the outcome of the battle was seized upon by the press of both nations as a demonstration of the prowess and bravery of their respective navies
the glorious first of june demonstrated a number of the major problems inherent in the french and british navies at the start of the revolutionary wars
both admirals were faced with disobedience from their captains along with ill @-@ discipline and poor training among their shorthanded crews and they failed to control their fleets effectively during the height of the combat
on <num> january <year> almost one year into the french revolutionary war republican @-@ held forts at brest in brittany fired on the british brig hms childers
note b a few weeks later following the execution of the imprisoned king louis xvi diplomatic ties between britain and france were broken
on <num> february france declared war on both britain and the dutch republic
protected from immediate invasion by the english channel britain prepared for an extensive naval campaign and dispatched troops to the netherlands for service against the french
throughout the remainder of <year> the british and french navies undertook minor operations in northern waters the mediterranean and the west and east indies where both nations maintained colonies
the closest the channel fleet had come to an engagement was when it had narrowly missed intercepting the french convoy from the caribbean escorted by <num> ships of the line on <num> august
the only major clash was the siege of toulon a confused and bloody affair in which the british force holding the town — alongside spanish sardinian austrian and french royalist troops — had to be evacuated by the royal navy to prevent its imminent defeat at the hands of the french republican army
the aftermath of this siege was punctuated by recriminations and accusations of cowardice and betrayal among the allies eventually resulting in spain switching allegiance with the signing of the treaty of san ildefonso two years later
nevertheless the siege produced one major success sir sidney smith with parties of sailors from the retreating british fleet accomplished the destruction of substantial french naval stores and shipping in toulon
more might have been achieved had the spanish raiding parties that accompanied smith not been issued with secret orders to stall the destruction of the french fleet
the situation in europe remained volatile into <year>
off northern france the french atlantic fleet had mutinied due to errors in provisions and pay
in consequence the french navy officer corps suffered greatly from the effects of the reign of terror with many experienced sailors being executed imprisoned or dismissed from the service for perceived disloyalty
the shortage of provisions was more than a navy problem though france itself was starving because the social upheavals of the previous year had combined with a harsh winter to ruin the harvest
by this time at war with all her neighbours france had nowhere to turn for overland imports of fresh provisions
eventually a solution to the food crisis was agreed by the national convention food produced in france 's overseas colonies would be concentrated on board a fleet of merchant ships gathered in chesapeake bay and augmented with food and goods purchased from the united states
during april and may <year> the merchantmen would convoy the supplies across the atlantic to brest protected by elements of the french atlantic fleet
although the british fleet was numerically superior the french ships were larger and stronger and carried a heavier weight of shot
the largest french ships were three @-@ decker first rates carrying <num> or <num> guns against <num> guns on the largest british vessels
the navy 's dockyards under first lord of the admiralty charles middleton were all fully fitted and prepared for conflict
this was quite unlike the disasters of the american revolutionary war ten years earlier when an ill @-@ prepared royal navy had taken too long to reach full effectiveness and was consequently unable to support the north american campaign — which ended in defeat at the battle of yorktown due to lack of supplies
with british dockyards now readily turning out cannon shot sails provisions and other essential equipment the only remaining problem was that of manning the several hundred ships on the navy list
unfortunately for the british gathering sufficient manpower was difficult and never satisfactorily accomplished throughout the entire war
the shortage of seamen was such that press gangs were forced to take thousands of men with no experience on the sea meaning that training and preparing them for naval life would take quite some time
the lack of royal marines was even more urgent and soldiers from the british army were drafted into the fleet for service at sea

regiment of foot the queen 's royal west surrey regiment and the <num> regiment of foot served aboard royal navy ships during the campaign their descendant regiments still maintain the battle honour <num> june <year>
despite these difficulties the channel fleet was possessed of one of the best naval commanders of the age its commander @-@ in @-@ chief richard howe 1st earl howe had learned his trade under sir edward hawke and fought at the battle of quiberon bay in <year>
in the spring of <year> with the french convoy 's arrival in european waters imminent howe had dispersed his fleet in three groups
george montagu in hms hector was sent with six ships of the line and two frigates to guard british convoys to the east indies west indies and newfoundland as far as cape finisterre
peter rainier in hms suffolk and commanding six other ships was to escort the convoys for the rest of their passage
the third force consisted of <num> ships of the line with several supporting vessels under howe 's direct command
they were to patrol the bay of biscay for the arriving french
although the quality of the fleet 's ships was high the fleet hierarchy was riven by the same crises that had torn through france since the revolution five years earlier
consequently the high standard of ships and ordnance was not matched by that of the available crews which were largely untrained and inexperienced
with the terror resulting in the death or dismissal of many senior french sailors and officers political appointees and conscripts – many of whom had never been to sea at all let alone in a fighting vessel – filled the atlantic fleet
the manpower problem was compounded by the supply crisis which was affecting the entire nation with the fleet going unpaid and largely unfed for months at times
in august <year> these problems came to a head in the fleet off brest when a lack of provisions resulted in a mutiny among the regular sailors
the crews overruled their officers and brought their ships into harbour in search of food leaving the french coast undefended
the national convention responded instantly by executing a swathe of senior officers and ship 's non @-@ commissioned officers
hundreds more officers and sailors were imprisoned banished or dismissed from naval service
the effect of this purge was devastating seriously degrading the fighting ability of the fleet by removing at a stroke many of its most capable personnel
in their places were promoted junior officers merchant captains and even civilians who expressed sufficient revolutionary zeal although few of them knew how to fight or control a battle fleet at sea
the newly appointed commander of this troubled fleet was villaret de joyeuse although formerly in a junior position he was known to possess a high degree of tactical ability he had trained under admiral pierre andré de suffren in the indian ocean during the american war
however villaret 's attempts to mould his new officer corps into an effective fighting unit were hampered by another new appointee a deputy of the national convention named jean @-@ bon saint @-@ andré
saint @-@ andré 's job was to report directly to the national convention on the revolutionary ardour of both the fleet and its admiral
he frequently intervened in strategic planning and tactical operations
shortly after his arrival saint @-@ andré proposed issuing a decree ordering that any officer deemed to have shown insufficient zeal in defending his ship in action should be put to death on his return to france although this highly controversial legislation does not appear to have ever been acted upon
although his interference was a source of frustration for villaret saint @-@ andré 's dispatches to paris were published regularly in le moniteur and did much to popularise the navy in france
the french atlantic fleet was even more dispersed than the british in the spring of <year> rear @-@ admiral pierre vanstabel had been dispatched with five ships including two of the line to meet the much @-@ needed french grain convoy off the american eastern seaboard
rear @-@ admiral joseph @-@ marie nielly had sailed from rochefort with five ships of the line and assorted cruising warships to rendezvous with the convoy in the mid @-@ atlantic
this left villaret with <num> ships of the line at brest to meet the threat posed by the british fleet under lord howe
with famine looming after the failure of the harvest and the blockade of french ports and trade the french government was forced to look overseas for sustenance
turning to france 's colonies in the americas and the agricultural bounty of the united states the national convention gave orders for the formation of a large convoy of sailing vessels to gather at hampton roads in the chesapeake bay where admiral vanstabel would wait for them
according to contemporary historian william james this conglomeration of ships was said to be over <num> strong although he disputes this figure citing the number as <num> in addition to the french warships
the convoy had also been augmented by the united states government in both cargo and shipping as repayment for french financial moral and military support during the american revolution
in supporting the french revolution in this way the american government urged especially by ambassador gouverneur morris was fulfilling its ten @-@ year @-@ old debt to france
friendly relations between the united states and france did not long survive the jay treaty which came into effect in <year> by <year> the two nations would be engaged in the quasi war
checking that villaret was still in brest howe spent two weeks searching the bay of biscay for the grain convoy returning to brest on <num> may to discover that villaret had sailed the previous day
note c returning to sea in search of his opponent howe pursued villaret deep into the atlantic
also at sea during this period were the squadrons of nielly french and montagu british both of whom had met with some success nielly had captured a number of british merchant ships and montagu had taken several back
nielly was the first to encounter the grain convoy deep in the atlantic in the second week of may
he took it under escort as it moved closer to europe while montagu was searching fruitlessly to the south
despite howe 's pursuit the main french sortie found initial success running into a dutch convoy and taking <num> ships from it on villaret 's first day at sea
for the next week howe continued to follow the french seizing and burning a trail of french @-@ held dutch ships and enemy corvettes
on <num> may howe spotted a straggler from villaret 's fleet and gave chase audacieux led howe straight to his opponent 's location
having finally found villaret on <num> may howe attacked using a flying squadron of his fastest ships to cut off its rearmost vessel révolutionnaire
this first rate was at various times engaged with six british ships and took heavy damage possibly striking her colours late in the action
as darkness fell the british and french fleets separated leaving révolutionnaire and her final enemy hms audacious still locked in combat behind them
these two ships parted company during the night and eventually returned to their respective home ports
by this stage villaret knew through his patrolling frigates that the grain convoy was close and deliberately took his fleet to the west hoping to decoy howe away from the vital convoy
taking the bait the following day howe attacked again but his attempt to split the french fleet in half was unsuccessful when his lead ship hms caesar failed to follow orders
much damage was done to both fleets but the action was inconclusive and the two forces again separated without having settled the issue
howe had however gained an important advantage during the engagement by seizing the weather gage enabling him to further attack villaret at a time of his choosing
three french ships were sent back to port with damage but these losses were offset by reinforcements gained the following day with the arrival of nielly 's detached squadron
battle was postponed during the next two days because of thick fog but when the haze lifted on <num> june <year> the battle lines were only <num> miles <num> km apart and howe was prepared to force a decisive action
he had attempted with near success to distance his ships from the british fleet when dawn broke at <num> <num> he was within a few hours of gaining enough wind to escape over the horizon
allowing his men to breakfast howe took full advantage of his position on the weather gage to close with villaret and by <num> <num> the british fleet was just four miles <num> km from the enemy
by this time howe 's formation was strung out in an organised line parallel to the french with frigates acting as repeaters for the admiral 's commands
the french were likewise in line ahead and the two lines began exchanging long @-@ range gunfire at <num> <num> whereupon howe unleashed his innovative battleplan
it was normal in fleet actions of the <num> century for the two lines of battle to pass one another sedately exchanging fire at long ranges and then wearing away often without either side losing a ship or taking an enemy
in contrast howe was counting on the professionalism of his captains and crews combined with the advantage of the weather gage to attack the french directly driving through their line
however this time he did not plan to manoeuvre in the way he had during the two previous encounters each ship following in the wake of that in front to create a new line arrowing through his opponent 's force as rodney had done at the battle of the saintes <num> years earlier
instead howe ordered each of his ships to turn individually towards the french line intending to breach it at every point and rake the french ships at both bow and stern
the british captains would then pull up on the leeward side of their opposite numbers cutting them off from their retreat downwind and engage them directly hopefully forcing each to surrender and consequently destroying the french atlantic fleet
many of the british captains had either misunderstood or ignored the signal and were hanging back in the original line
other ships were still struggling with damage from howe 's earlier engagements and could not get into action fast enough
the result was a ragged formation tipped by queen charlotte that headed unevenly for villaret 's fleet
the french responded by firing on the british ships as they approached but the lack of training and coordination in the french fleet was obvious many ships which did obey howe 's order and attacked the french directly arrived in action without significant damage
that distinction belonged to a ship of the van squadron under admiral graves hms defence under captain james gambier a notoriously dour officer nicknamed dismal jimmy by his contemporaries
defence the seventh ship of the british line successfully cut the french line between its sixth and seventh ships mucius and tourville
raking both opponents defence soon found herself in difficulty due to the failure of those ships behind her to properly follow up
this left her vulnerable to mucius tourville and the ships following them with which she began a furious fusillade
however defence was not the only ship of the van to break the french line minutes later george cranfield @-@ berkeley in hms marlborough executed howe 's manoeuvre perfectly raking and then entangling his ship with impétueux
in front of marlborough the rest of the van had mixed success
hms bellerophon and hms leviathan were both still suffering the effects of their exertions earlier in the week and did not breach the enemy line
instead they pulled along the near side of éole and america respectively and brought them to close gunnery duels
rear @-@ admiral thomas pasley of bellerophon was an early casualty losing a leg in the opening exchanges
hms royal sovereign graves 's flagship was less successful due to a miscalculation of distance that resulted in her pulling up too far from the french line and coming under heavy fire from her opponent terrible
in the time it took to engage terrible more closely royal sovereign suffered a severe pounding and admiral graves was badly wounded
more disturbing to lord howe were the actions of hms russell and hms caesar
russell 's captain john willett payne was criticised at the time for failing to get to grips with the enemy more closely and allowing her opponent téméraire to badly damage her rigging in the early stages although later commentators blamed damage received on <num> may for her poor start to the action
there were no such excuses however for captain anthony molloy of caesar who totally failed in his duty to engage the enemy
molloy completely ignored howe 's signal and continued ahead as if the british battleline was following him rather than engaging the french fleet directly
caesar did participate in a desultory exchange of fire with the leading french ship trajan but her fire had little effect while trajan inflicted much damage to caesar 's rigging and was subsequently able to attack bellerophon as well roaming unchecked through the melee developing at the head of the line
while howe in queen charlotte was engaging the french closely his subordinates in the forward division were less active
instead of moving in on their opposite numbers directly the forward division sedately closed with the french in line ahead formation engaging in a long distance duel which did not prevent their opponents from harassing the embattled defence just ahead of them
of all the ships in this squadron only hms invincible under thomas pakenham ranged close to the french lines
invincible was badly damaged by her lone charge but managed to engage the larger juste
hms barfleur under bowyer did later enter the action but bowyer was not present having lost a leg in the opening exchanges
howe and queen charlotte led the fleet by example sailing directly at the french flagship montagne
passing between montagne and the next in line vengeur du peuple queen charlotte raked both and hauled up close to montagne to engage in a close @-@ range artillery battle
as she did so queen charlotte also became briefly entangled with jacobin and exchanged fire with her too causing serious damage to both french ships
to the right of queen charlotte hms brunswick had initially struggled to join the action
labouring behind the flagship her captain john harvey received a rebuke from howe for the delay
spurred by this signal harvey pushed his ship forward and almost outstripped queen charlotte blocking her view of the eastern half of the french fleet for a time and taking severe damage from french fire as she did so
harvey hoped to run aboard jacobin and support his admiral directly but was not fast enough to reach her and so attempted to cut between achille and vengeur du peuple
this manoeuvre failed when brunswick 's anchors became entangled in vengeur 's rigging
harvey 's master asked if vengeur should be cut loose to which harvey replied no we have got her and we will keep her
the two ships swung so close to each other that brunswick 's crew could not open their gunports and had to fire through the closed lids the ships battering each other from a distance of just a few feet
behind this combat other ships of the centre division struck the french line hms valiant under thomas pringle passing close to patriote which pulled away her crew suffering from contagion and unable to take their ship into battle
valiant instead turned her attention on achille which had already been raked by queen charlotte and brunswick and badly damaged her before pressing on sail to join the embattled van division
hms orion under john thomas duckworth and hms queen under admiral alan gardner both attacked the same ship queen suffering severely from the earlier actions in which her masts were badly damaged and her captain john hutt mortally wounded
both ships bore down on the french northumberland which was soon dismasted and left attempting to escape on only the stump of a mast
queen was too slow to engage northumberland as closely as orion and soon fell in with jemmappes both ships battering each other severely
admiral hood 's flagship hms royal george pierced it between républicain and sans pareil engaging both closely while hms glory came through the line behind sans pareil and threw herself into the melee as well
the rest of the british and french rearguard did not participate in this close combat hms montagu fought a long range gunnery duel with neptune which damaged neither ship severely although the british captain james montagu was killed in the opening exchanges command devolving on lieutenant ross donnelly
next in line hms ramillies ignored her opponent completely and sailed west captain henry harvey seeking brunswick his brother 's ship in the confused action around queen charlotte
three other british ships failed to respond to the signal from howe including hms alfred which engaged the french line at extreme range without noticeable effect and captain charles cotton in hms majestic who likewise did little until the action was decided at which point he took the surrender of several already shattered french ships
finally hms thunderer under albemarle bertie took no part in the initial action at all standing well away from the british line and failing to engage the enemy despite the signal for close engagement hanging limply from her mainmast
the french rear ships were no less idle with entreprenant and pelletier firing at any british ships in range but refusing to close or participate in the melees on either side
the french rear ship scipion did not attempt to join the action either but could not avoid becoming embroiled in the group around royal george and républicain and suffered severe damage
in the van caesar had finally attempted to join the fight only to have a vital spar shot away by trajan which caused her to slip down the two embattled fleets without contributing significantly to the battle
bellerophon and leviathan were in the thick of the action the outnumbered bellerophon taking serious damage to her rigging
this left her unable to manoeuvre and in danger from her opponents of which eole also suffered severely
captain william johnstone hope sought to extract his ship from her perilous position and called up support the frigate hms latona under captain edward thornbrough arrived to provide assistance
thornbrough brought his small ship between the ships of the french battleline and opened fire on eole helping to drive off three ships of the line and then towing bellerophon to safety
leviathan under lord hugh seymour had been more successful than bellerophon her gunnery dismasting america despite receiving fire from eole and trajan in passing
leviathan only left america after a two @-@ hour duel sailing at <num> <num> to join queen charlotte in the centre
russell had not broken the french line and her opponent témeraire got the better of her knocking away a topmast and escaping to windward with trajan and eole
russell then fired on several passing french ships before joining leviathan in attacking the centre of the french line
russell 's boats also took the surrender of america her crew boarding the vessel to make her a prize although later replaced by men from royal sovereign
royal sovereign lost admiral graves to a serious wound and lost her opponent as well as terrible fell out of the line to windward and joined a growing collection of french ships forming a new line on the far side of the action
villaret was leading this line in his flagship montagne which had escaped from queen charlotte and it was montagne which royal sovereign engaged next pursuing her close to the new french line accompanied by valiant and beginning a long @-@ range action
behind royal sovereign was marlborough inextricably tangled with impétueux
badly damaged and on the verge of surrender impétueux was briefly reprieved when mucius appeared through the smoke and collided with both ships
the three entangled ships continued exchanging fire for some time all suffering heavy casualties with marlborough and impétueux losing all three of their masts
this combat continued for several hours
captain berkeley of marlborough had to retire below with serious wounds and command fell to lieutenant john monkton who signalled for help from the frigates in reserve
robert stopford responded in hms aquilon which had the assignment of repeating signals and towed marlborough out of the line as mucius freed herself and made for the regrouped french fleet to the north
impétueux was in too damaged a state to move at all and was soon seized by sailors from hms russell
dismasted defence was unable to hold any of her various opponents to a protracted duel and by <num> <num> was threatened by the damaged républicain moving from the east
although républicain later hauled off to join villaret to the north gambier requested support for his ship from the fleet 's frigates and was aided by hms phaeton under captain william bentinck
as impétueux passed she fired on phaeton to which bentinck responded with several broadsides of his own
invincible the only ship of the forward division of the british centre to engage the enemy closely became embroiled in the confusion surrounding queen charlotte
invincible 's guns drove juste onto the broadside of queen charlotte where she was forced to surrender to lieutenant henry blackwood in a boat from invincible
among the other ships of the division there were only minor casualties although hms impregnable lost several yards and was only brought back into line by the quick reactions of two junior officers lieutenant robert otway and midshipman charles dashwood
the conflict between queen charlotte and montagne was oddly one @-@ sided the french flagship failing to make use of her lower @-@ deck guns and consequently suffering extensive damage and casualties
queen charlotte in her turn was damaged by fire from nearby ships and was therefore unable to follow when montagne set her remaining sails and slipped to the north to create a new focal point for the survivors of the french fleet
queen charlotte also took fire during the engagement from hms gibraltar under thomas mackenzie which had failed to close with the enemy and instead fired at random into the smoke bank surrounding the flagship
captain sir andrew snape douglas was seriously wounded by this fire
following montagne 's escape queen charlotte engaged jacobin and républicain as they passed and was successful in forcing the surrender of juste
to the east of queen charlotte brunswick and vengeur du peuple continued their bitter combat locked together and firing main broadsides from point blank range
captain harvey of brunswick was mortally wounded early in this action by langrage fire from vengeur but refused to quit the deck ordering more fire into his opponent
brunswick also managed to drive achille off from her far side when the french ship attempted to intervene
achille already damaged was totally dismasted in the exchange and briefly surrendered although her crew rescinded this when it became clear brunswick was in no position to take possession
with her colours rehoisted achille then made what sail she could in an attempt to join villaret to the north
it was not until <num> <num> that the shattered vengeur and brunswick pulled apart both largely dismasted and very battered
brunswick was only able to return to the british side of the line after being supported by ramillies while vengeur was unable to move at all
ramillies took vengeur 's surrender after a brief cannonade but was unable to board her and instead pursued the fleeing achille which soon surrendered as well
to the east orion and queen forced the surrender of both northumberland and jemmappes although queen was unable to secure jemmappes and she had to be abandoned later
queen especially was badly damaged and unable to make the british lines again wallowing between the newly reformed french fleet and the british battleline along with several other shattered ships
royal george and glory had between them disabled scipion and sans pareil in a bitter exchange but were also too badly damaged themselves to take possession
all four ships were among those left drifting in the gap between the fleets
at <num> <num> with the main action drawing to a close he began a recovery manoeuvre intended to lessen the tactical defeat his fleet had suffered
aiming his new squadron at the battered queen villaret 's attack created consternation in the british fleet which was unprepared for a second engagement
however discerning villaret 's intention howe also pulled his ships together to create a new force
his reformed squadron consisted of queen charlotte royal sovereign valiant leviathan barfleur and thunderer
howe deployed this squadron in defence of queen and the two short lines engaged one another at a distance before villaret abandoned his manoeuvre and hauled off to collect several of his own dismasted ships that were endeavouring to escape british pursuit
villaret was subsequently joined by the battered terrible which sailed straight through the dispersed british fleet to reach the french lines and he also recovered the dismasted scipion mucius jemmappes and républicain — all of which lay within reach of the unengaged british ships — before turning eastwards towards france
at this stage of the battle howe retired below and the british consolidation was left to his captain of the fleet sir roger curtis
curtis was subsequently blamed by some in the navy for not capturing more of the dismasted french ships and was also accused of dissuading howe from attempting further pursuit
in fact the british fleet was unable to pursue villaret having only <num> ships still capable of battle to the french <num> and having numerous dismasted ships and prizes to protect
retiring and regrouping the british crews set about making hasty repairs and securing their prizes seven in total including the badly damaged vengeur du peuple
vengeur had been holed by cannon firing from brunswick directly through the ship 's bottom and after her surrender no british ship had managed to get men aboard
this left vengeur 's few remaining unwounded crew to attempt to salvage what they could — a task made harder when some of her sailors broke into the spirit room and became drunk
ultimately the ship 's pumps became unmanageable and vengeur began to sink
only the timely arrival of boats from the undamaged alfred and hms culloden as well as the services of the cutter hms rattler saved any of the vengeur 's crew from drowning these ships taking off nearly <num> sailors between them
lieutenant john winne of rattler was especially commended for this hazardous work
by <num> <num> vengeur was clearly beyond salvage and only the very worst of the wounded the dead and the drunk remained aboard
several sailors are said to have waved the tricolor from the bow of the ship and cried vive la nation vive la république having escaped to the east villaret made what sail his battered fleet could muster to return to france and dispatched his frigates in search of the convoy
villaret was also hoping for reinforcements eight ships of the line commanded by admiral pierre @-@ françois cornic were patrolling near the ushant headland
behind him to the west the british took the whole night to secure their ships and prizes not setting out to return to britain until <num> <num> on <num> june
casualties in the battle are notoriously hard to calculate exactly
with only one exception scipion records made by the french captains of their losses at the time are incomplete
the only immediately available casualty counts are the sketchy reports of saint @-@ andré and the records made by british officers aboard the captured ships neither of which can be treated as completely reliable
most sources accept that french casualties in the campaign numbered approximately <num> @,@ <num> including around <num> @,@ <num> captured but these figures are vague and frequently do not agree with each other on details
british casualties are easier to confirm but here too there are some discrepancies overall british casualties are generally given as around <num> @,@ <num>
the admiralty though unaware of howe 's specific circumstances knew a battle had taken place through the arrival of hms audacious in portsmouth and was preparing a second expedition under george montagu
montagu had returned to england after his unsuccessful may cruise and was refitting in portsmouth when ordered to sea again
his force of ten ships was intended to both cover howe 's withdrawal from biscay and find and attack the french grain convoy
montagu returned to sea on <num> june and by <num> june was off ushant searching for signs of either the french or howe unknown to him neither had yet entered european waters
at <num> <num> on <num> june montagu spotted sails and soon identified them as the enemy
he had located cornic 's squadron which was also patrolling for the convoy and the returning fleets
montagu gave chase and drove cornic into bertheaume bay where he blockaded the french squadron overnight hoping to bring them to action the following day
however on <num> june montagu sighted <num> french ships appearing from the west — the remnants of villaret 's fleet
hastily turning his ships montagu sailed south to avoid becoming trapped between two forces which might easily overwhelm him
villaret and cornic gave chase for a day before turning east towards the safety of the french ports
howe benefited from montagu 's withdrawal as his own battered fleet passed close to the scene of this stand @-@ off on <num> june pushing north into the english channel
with villaret and cornic fortuitously pursuing montagu to the south howe was free to pass ushant without difficulty and arrived off plymouth on <num> june joined soon afterwards by montagu
villaret had anchored with cornic in bertheaume bay the day before but saint @-@ andré refused to allow him to enter brest until the republican attitudes of the town 's population had been assessed
on <num> june the convoy from america finally arrived off france having lost just one ship in passage during a storm
the two fleets were showered by their respective nations with both praise and criticism – the latter particularly directed at those captains not felt to have contributed significantly to the fighting
the british fleet in spithead was treated with a royal visit by king george iii and the entire royal household
in addition the fleet 's officers took part in a celebratory parade from brest to paris accompanying the recently arrived food supplies
the role of vengeur du peuple was mythified by bertrand barrère giving birth to an exalted legend
opinion in france concerning the battle 's outcome was divided while many celebrated saint @-@ andré 's exaggerated accounts of victory in le moniteur senior naval officers disagreed
among the dissenters was the highly experienced but recently dismissed admiral kerguelen
kerguelen was disgusted by villaret 's failure to renew the battle after he had reformed his squadron and felt that the french fleet could have been successful tactically as well as strategically if only villaret had made greater efforts to engage the remains of howe 's fleet
the french navy had suffered its worst losses in a single day since the battle of la hogue in <year>
ultimately the revolutionary excesses of the period would prove disastrous for the french navy
poor leadership conflicting and arbitrary orders and the decimation of the experienced seamen in the ranks promoted a negative attitude in the french officer corps
the french battlefleet did not contest british dominance in northern european waters again and their raiding operations repeatedly ended in failure at the hands of more confident british squadrons and the unforgiving atlantic weather
by <year> when the last great french fleet to take to the sea was crushed at the battle of trafalgar poor training and low investment in the navy had reduced its efficiency to levels unthinkable <num> years earlier
admiral howe already an earl refused any further elevation and king george iii was dissuaded from making him a knight of the garter by one of howe 's political opponents
vice @-@ admiral graves was elevated to the peerage of ireland as baron graves while vice @-@ admiral hood was made viscount bridport
rear @-@ admirals bowyer gardner pasley and curtis the last @-@ named was promoted from captain on <num> july <year> were all made baronets and bowyer and pasley also received pensions of £ <num> @,@ <num> a year to compensate them for their severe wounds
all first lieutenants were promoted to commander and numerous other officers were promoted in consequence of their actions
the thanks of parliament were unanimously passed to all who fought at the action and various other gifts and awards were distributed among the fleet
a memorial to captains john hutt and john harvey both of whom had died of their wounds on <num> june was raised in westminster abbey
there was however a bitter consequence of the awards rooted in howe 's official dispatch to the admiralty concerning the battle which according to some accounts was actually written by curtis
howe had appended a list to his report containing the names of officers whom he believed merited special reward for their part in the battle
the list included vice @-@ admirals graves and hood rear @-@ admirals bowyer gardner and pasley and captains seymour pakenham cranfield @-@ berkeley gambier john harvey payne henry harvey pringle duckworth elphinstone nichols and hope
also mentioned were lieutenants monkton and donnelly
the list had omitted a number of officers who had served in the battle and the justice of their omission was a highly controversial issue in the navy
rear @-@ admiral caldwell was the sole british flag officer present not to receive a hereditary honour although he was promoted to vice @-@ admiral on <num> july as were bowyer and gardner
after studying the ship 's logs and reports of the battle the admiralty minted a medal to be awarded to the living captains on the list only although captain william parker of hms audacious was awarded one as well
the captains excluded from the list were furious and the furor from this selective commendation lasted years in <year> vice @-@ admiral caldwell quit the service in anger as a result while cuthbert collingwood flag captain of barfleur refused all awards for future service until the glorious first of june medal was presented to him as well
he eventually received it after the battle of cape st vincent in <year>
over five decades later the battle was among the actions recognised by a clasp attached to the naval general service medal awarded upon application to all british participants still living in <year>
bitterest of all was the whispering campaign directed at anthony molloy captain of hms caesar
molloy was accused of cowardice by fellow officers for his failure to follow howe 's orders on both <num> may and <num> june
molloy 's request for an official court @-@ martial to clear his name failed and although his personal courage was not called into question his professional ability was
molloy was dismissed from his ship
of the captured ships several were purchased and enjoyed long careers in the royal navy in particular the two <num> @-@ gun ships hms sans pareil which was decommissioned in <year> but not broken up until <year> and hms juste which was a popular command until her decommissioning in <year> at the peace of amiens
of the four <num> @-@ gun prizes achille and northumberland both <num> built in the late <num> were broken up as unserviceable soon after arrival in britain while impétueux was destroyed in a dockyard fire on <num> august <year> while undergoing repairs

changes from the standard tu @-@ <num> were minimized to speed production and they consisted of the following two nene jet engines replaced the standard shvetsov ash @-@ 82fn radial engines
the wing dihedral was reduced to <num> ° from <num> °
the fuselage was lengthened <num> mm <num> in and the rear fuselage was heightened by <num> mm <num> in
a new tricycle undercarriage was fitted with the main gear units retracting into the engine nacelles
additional fuel tanks were fitted and the design of the tanks was changed to accommodate the change from gasoline to kerosene
the control system was revised and trim tabs were fitted to the elevators
the wing and tail were reinforced
the <num> mm <num>

two aircraft were shown at the tushino aviation day display on <num> august <year>
it completed its manufacturer 's trials in september and underwent the state acceptance trials from <num> october <year> to <num> february <year> where it was redesignated as the tu @-@ <num>
the nii vvs naoochno @-@ issledovatel 'skiy institoot voyenno @-@ vozdooshnykh seel – air force scientific test institute report summarized the differences between the tu @-@ <num> and tu @-@ <num> as a considerable gain in speed an improved rate of climb a higher service ceiling but poorer field performance and a considerably greater fuel load required to achieve the same range as the tu @-@ <num>
both the lack of a pressurized cabin that greatly reduced its effectiveness at high altitude and the lack of deicing equipment for the wing and tail leading edges and the cockpit glazing were noted as major problems
at high speeds it was virtually impossible to traverse and elevate the manually operated vub @-@ <num> and lu @-@ <num> gun turrets
the vibration of the ns @-@ <num> cannon when firing rendered the equipment in the navigator 's cabin unusable and damaged the cabin glazing
turning on the identification friend or foe iff system adversely affected the intercom system and the radios
new generators had to be installed as the originals did not produce enough electrical power
the trials conducted by the nii vvs included engagements between the tu @-@ <num> and the soviet mig @-@ <num> and yak @-@ <num> jet fighters which were very useful in evaluating the offensive armament of the fighters the defensive armament of the bomber and the proper tactics involved for both types of aircraft

from <year> to <year> nearly <num> @,@ <num> draftees willing to serve their country in some capacity but unwilling to perform any type of military service accepted assignments in work of national importance in <num> cps camps throughout the united states and puerto rico
draftees from the historic peace churches and other faiths worked in areas such as soil conservation forestry fire fighting agriculture under the supervision of such agencies as the u
s
forest service the soil conservation service and the national park service
others helped provide social services and mental health services
the cps men served without wages and minimal support from the federal government
the cost of maintaining the cps camps and providing for the needs of the men was the responsibility of their congregations and families
cps men served longer than regular draftees and were not released until well after the end of the war
initially skeptical of the program government agencies learned to appreciate the men 's service and requested more workers from the program
cps made significant contributions to forest fire prevention erosion and flood control medical science and reform of the mental health system
during wartime this stance conflicts with conscription efforts
those willing to accept non @-@ combatant roles such as medical personnel are accommodated
there are few legal options for draftees who cannot cooperate with the military in any way
this exemption effectively limited conscientious objector status to members of the historic peace churches mennonites and other anabaptist groups such as hutterites religious society of friends quakers and church of the brethren
the law gave the president authority to assign such draftees to any noncombatant military role
conscientious objectors who refused noncombatant service during world war i were imprisoned in military facilities such as fort lewis washington alcatraz island california and fort leavenworth kansas
the government assumed that cos could be converted into soldiers once they were exposed to life in their assigned military camps
simultaneously the justice department was preparing to indict <num> mennonite leaders for violating the espionage act because of a statement they adopted against performing military service
the draftees refusal to put on a uniform or cooperate in any way caused difficulties for both the government and the cos
the treatment received by nearly <year> of these absolute cos included short rations solitary confinement and physical abuse so severe as to cause the deaths of two hutterite draftees
holding a common view that any participation in military service was not acceptable they devised a plan of civilian alternative service based on experience gained by american friends service committee work in europe during and after world war i and forestry service done by russian mennonites in lieu of military service in tsarist russia
as the united states prepared for another war the historic peace churches represented by friends who understood inner dealings of washington d
c
politics attempted to influence new draft bills to ensure their men could fulfill their duty in an alternative non @-@ military type of service
on june <num> <year> the burke @-@ wadsworth bill came before congress
the arrangements for conscientious objectors were almost identical to the world war i provisions
the burke @-@ wadsworth bill passed on september <num> <year> becoming the selective training and service act of <year>
the influence of the churches was evident in section <num> g which says in part any such person claiming such exemption from combatant training and service
in lieu of such induction be assigned to work of national importance under civilian direction
the bill offered four improvements from the perspective of the churches over the world war i provisions
the exemption applied to conscientious objection based on religious training or belief opening the door for members of any religious denomination to apply for co status
draftees turned down by local draft board could appeal under the new law
those assigned to work of national importance would be under civilian not military control and violations of law on the part of those in the program were subject to normal federal jurisdiction not the military justice system
from the military perspective it removed the burden of dealing with thousands of uncooperative draftees and segregated the cos and their philosophy from military service members
unlike harsher methods the military found that this gentler approach resulted in about one in eight eventually transferring to military service
church representatives meeting with government officials learned that little thought had been put into the program and the churches were advised to create a plan
because the government wanted to deal with one body not individual religious denominations the national council for religious conscientious objectors was formed as a liaison between the churches and the federal government
the historic peace churches outlined a plan that included running and maintaining cps camps under church control
however president roosevelt opposed any plan not involving military control over the draftees
to save their plan and retain civilian direction of the program the churches offered to fund the camps
aides convinced roosevelt that putting the cos to work in out @-@ of @-@ the @-@ way camps was preferable to repeating the difficulties of world war i
selective service and the peace churches agreed to a six @-@ month trial of church supported and funded camps for conscientious objectors and thus civilian public service was born
the first camp opened on may <num> <year> near baltimore maryland
a total of <num> camps and units were established over the next six years
the federal government provided work projects housing camp furnishings and paid for transportation to the camps
the responsibilities of the churches included day @-@ to @-@ day management of the camps subsistence costs meals and healthcare for the men
when the young men arrived at the first camps they started a six @-@ month experiment that would extend to six years
the camps served as a base of operations from which the cos departed to their daily assignments
sites were located typically in rural areas near the agricultural soil conservation and forestry projects where the work took place
a large camp such as number <num> near hill city south dakota had five dormitories and housed as many as <num> men building the deerfield dam
later with projects located in urban areas the men lived in smaller units communal housing near their assignments
cps men typically worked nine hours six days per week
mennonite central committee american friends service committee and brethren service committee administered almost all of the camps
the association of catholic conscientious objectors managed four camps and the methodist world peace commission two
each camp was assigned a director responsible for supervising camp operation
the director managed the needs of the men oversaw maintenance of the camp facilities handled community relations and reported to selective service officials
initially a pastor had the camp director role
later capable men from among the cps workers directed the camps
besides the director a matron business manager and dietitian staffed a typical camp
an educational director was responsible for creating recreational social and educational programs for the men
church history bible and first aid were standard course topics
the strength of instructional programs varied from camp to camp and after nine hours of physical labor it could be difficult to motivate the men to attend classes
most camps had libraries some showed current films and camp number <num> camp angel near waldport oregon had a particular emphasis on the arts
camps produced newsletters and yearbooks documenting their experiences
the camp dietitian with the help of men assigned as cooks prepared all of the meals
camps with large gardens provided their own fresh vegetables
sponsoring congregations also supplied home canned and fresh produce
the camps were subject to the same shortages and rationing as the rest of the nation
sunday worship services were organized by the camp director if he was a pastor by a visiting pastor or by the cps men themselves
while the historic peace churches organized the cps <num> of the men came from other denominations and <num> claimed no religious affiliation
men spent their free time doing crafts such as woodworking rugmaking leatherwork and photography
outdoor activities included hiking and swimming
men formed choirs and music ensembles performing in neighboring towns when relations were good
the men earned two days of furlough for each month of service
these days could be saved to allow enough time to travel several hundred miles home or in some cases traded to other men in exchange for cash
men with wives and dependents found it difficult to support their families
beyond a small allowance the men did not get paid for their service nor were their dependents given an allowance
to be closer to their husbands women sought employment near their husband 's assignment
later when jobs on dairy farms became available families could live together in housing provided for farm workers
men who became uncooperative with the cps system and were unable to adjust to the church @-@ managed camps were reassigned to a few camps managed by the selective service system
these camps tended to be the least productive and most difficult to administer
men who felt compelled to protest the restrictions of the conscription law attempted to disrupt the program through the use of various techniques including the initiation of work slowdowns and labor strikes
routine rule breaking frustrated camp directors
the most difficult cases were given to the federal court system and the men imprisoned
the churches also provided and paid for the camp director
the men received an allowance of between <num>
<num> and <num>
<num> monthly for personal needs
when jobs were available in surrounding farms and communities those willing to work beyond their regular cps jobs could earn extra spending money
the federal government spent <num>
<num> million on the cps program
the men performed <num> million of unpaid labor in return
men who worked for farmers or psychiatric hospitals received regular wages which they were required to give to the federal government
objections to this practice developed immediately because the men felt they were helping to fund the war
a compromise was reached where the wages were put into a special fund that was unused until after the end of the war
at one point church representatives attempted unsuccessfully to have these funds used for providing a living allowance for the men 's dependents
later men were assigned to projects in cities where they worked in hospitals psychiatric wards and university research centers
by august <year> <num> men worked on dairy farms and with milk testing
labor @-@ intensive farming operations like dairies were short of workers and accepted cos to help fill the gap
men assigned to the bureau of reclamation built contours to prevent soil erosion constructed <num> reservoirs and <num> dams
a sixth of all cps work was performed in this area
between fires they built forest trails cared for nursery stock planted thousands of seedlings and engaged in pest control
campgrounds and roadways on the blue ridge parkway and skyline drive of virginia are products of cps labor
hundreds of men volunteered for smoke jumping showing their willingness to take great personal risks
when fire was detected by a lookout smoke jumpers were flown directly to the site and dropped by parachute to quickly contain and extinguish the fire
from base camps scattered through the forests of montana idaho and oregon the men were flown as many as <num> miles to fire sites carrying firefighting tools and a two @-@ day supply of k @-@ rations
for larger fires additional men supplies and food were airdropped to expand the effort
up to <num> cps men served in this specialized program
one of the smokejumping schools was at camp paxson in montana
understaffed wards at philadelphia state hospital had one attendant member for <num> patients the minimum ratio being <num> <num>
the government balked at initial requests that cps workers have these positions believing it better to keep the men segregated in the rural camps to prevent the spread of their philosophy
eventually the men received permission to work for the mental institutions as attendants or psychiatric aides
individuals who found jobs at the rural camps unfulfilling and meaningless volunteered for this new type of assignment
the mental health field promised to provide the work of national importance that the program was designed to produce
by the end of <year> more than <year> cps men worked in <num> institutions in <num> states
the cps men discovered appalling conditions in the mental hospital wards
in an interview a conscientious objector described his experience when he first entered a mental hospital in october <year> it is sort of like a perpetual bad dream
the smells the sounds of the insane voices the bad equipment
the long dark corridors
i tell you it is all very much like a medieval fairytale of the nether regions
we ’ d heard about how these patients had been treated by the attendants beat with rods you know do all kind of things
we took a vow before we left the camp we decided that we would not assault or in any way strike a patient
i opened one of those rooms and there was a man lying on the floor
i leaned over to try to see what i could do to minister to him in some way do something for him
he may have been on a mattress or he may have been on the bare floor
no he was on the bare floor because when i tried to move him his skin came off
his skin was bloody and stuck to the floor and when i tried to lift him up it just peeled his skin off
he was in the last stages of syphilis
he died less than a week afterwards
now that was my first introduction to what was badly needed in that institution
the cps men objected to the mistreatment and abuse of patients and determined to improve conditions in the psychiatric wards
they wanted to show other attendants alternatives to violence when dealing with patients
frank olmstead chairman of the war resisters league observed one objector assigned to a violent ward refused to take the broomstick offered by the charge
when he entered the ward the patients crowded around asking where is your broomstick he said he thought he would not need it
but suppose some of us gang up on you the co guessed they wouldn 't do that and started talking about other things
within a few days the patients were seen gathering around the unarmed attendant telling him of their troubles
he felt much safer than the charge who had only his broomstick for company
outraged workers surveyed cps men in other hospitals and learned of the degree of abuse throughout the psychiatric care system
contacting church managers and government officials the cos begin advocating for reforms to end the abuses
conditions were exposed in institutions such as cleveland state hospital eastern state hospital in virginia and hudson river state hospital
one explained and the governor came in and they cleaned out the hospital
i mean they had hearings
we all had to appear in court and all that kind of stuff
and within a month or so the hospital was completely changed
the superintendent was fired and the new superintendent was put in and not only did they do our hospital they did all the hospitals mental hospitals in virginia
the reformers were especially active at the byberry hospital in philadelphia where four friends initiated the the attendant magazine as a way to communicate ideas and promote reform
this periodical later became the psychiatric aide a professional journal for mental health workers
on may <num> <year> life magazine printed an exposé of the mental healthcare system based on the reports of cos
another effort of cps mental hygiene project became the national mental health foundation
initially skeptical about the value of civilian public service eleanor roosevelt impressed by the changes introduced by cos in the mental health system became a sponsor of the national mental health foundation and actively inspired other prominent citizens including owen j
roberts pearl buck and harry emerson fosdick to join her in advancing the organization 's objectives of reform and humane treatment of patients
these experiments involved a range of research topics sometimes endangering the health of the cos
hepatitis during the <num> the cause method of communication and treatment of infectious hepatitis was not well understood
experimentation began with cos working at psychiatric hospitals and was expanded to a major research project with <num> to <num> test subjects at the university of pennsylvania and yale university
the men were inoculated with infected blood plasma swallowed nose and throat washings and the human body wastes of infected patients and drank contaminated water
as a young surgeon c
everett koop was part of the research team at the university of pennsylvania school of medicine
he related his experience with cps test subjects and the first time i was introduced to this whole program when i as a young surgeon was asked to do serial biopsies on their livers to see what the effect of the virus was in the production of the changes in the liver
and in that way i got to know that a lot of these young men had no idea that the risk they were taking also included death
and some of those youngsters did die and it was a very difficult thing for me to be part of because you know you ’ re powerless when you ’ re part of the big team
it couldn 't happen today
internal review boards would not permit the use of a live virus in human subjects unless they really understood what was going to happen to them
and i doubt that even if they knew what the risk was that an internal review board in any academic institution would consent to that kind of experimental work
the hepatitis research was instrumental in determining a virus is responsible for the disease and that it is transmitted through human filth serum and drinking water
malaria during the early <num> quinine was the chief anti @-@ malarial drug
made from the bark of the south american cinchona tree quinine was in short supply during the war so scientists began searching for an alternative treatment
the test subjects allowed themselves to be bitten by malarial mosquitoes and when the fever reached its peak in three to four days were given experimental treatments
at the university of minnesota twelve cps men underwent tests to determine the recovery period for those infected with malaria
this research documented the debilitating effects of the disease and the amount of time required for a complete recovery
common cold and atypical pneumonia a hundred cps men participated with tests such that they inhaled or drank throat washings from soldiers with colds and pneumonia
this research proved that colds and some types of pneumonia are cause by a virus not bacteria
minnesota starvation experiment to study the effects of diet and nutrition dr
ancel keys of the university of minnesota laboratory of physiological hygiene placed <num> conscientious objectors on a controlled diet
for three months they were given a normal <num> @,@ <num> calories <num> @,@ <num> kj diet
this was followed by six months of an <num> @,@ <num> calories <num> @,@ <num> kj diet fewer calories than provided by the famine diet experienced by the civilian population in wartime europe
the research documented the men 's ability to maintain physical output and the psychological effects such as introversion lethargy irritability and severe depression
the study then followed the men 's long recovery as they returned to a normal diet and regained the weight lost during the experimentation
the study provided valuable insights into hunger and starvation and the results were made available to all major relief agencies concerned with postwar food and nutrition problems helping to inspire the marshall plan
reforms in the mental health system continued after the war
the experience of mennonite cos was instrumental in creating regional mental health facilities in california kansas and maryland
lewis hill who was in cps camp number <num> near coleville california together with several other cos founded pacifica network and kpfa radio in berkeley california the world 's first listener @-@ sponsored radio station
poets william everson and william stafford were both in cps camps
actor francis fritz william weaver spent time in the big flats new york cps camp number <num>
men from the historic peace churches volunteered for relief and reconstruction after their release from cps
the <year> nobel peace prize was awarded to american and british friends service committees for their relief work in europe after the war
mennonite central committee redirected its effort from camp administration to relief and reconstruction in europe after the war
civilian public service created a precedent for the alternative service program for conscientious objectors in the united states during the korean and vietnam wars
although the cps program was not duplicated the idea of offering men an opportunity to do work of national importance instead of military service was established
it is separated from great britain to its east by the north channel the irish sea and st george 's channel
ireland is the second @-@ largest island of the british isles the third @-@ largest in europe and the twentieth @-@ largest on earth
politically ireland is divided between the republic of ireland officially named ireland which covers five @-@ sixths of the island and northern ireland which is part of the united kingdom in the northeast of the island
in <year> the population of ireland was about <num>
<num> million ranking it the second @-@ most populous island in europe after great britain
just under <num>
<num> million live in the republic of ireland and just over <num>
<num> million live in northern ireland
the island 's geography comprises relatively low @-@ lying mountains surrounding a central plain with several navigable rivers extending inland
the island has lush vegetation a product of its mild but changeable climate which avoids extremes in temperature
thick woodlands covered the island until the middle ages
as of <year> the amount of land that is wooded in ireland is about <num> of the total compared with a european average of <num>
there are twenty @-@ six extant mammal species native to ireland
the irish climate is very moderated and classified as oceanic
as a result winters are milder than expected for such a northerly area
however summers are cooler than those in continental europe
rainfall and cloud cover are abundant
the earliest evidence of human presence in ireland is dated at <num> @,@ <num> bc
gaelic ireland had emerged by the 1st century ad and lasted until the first world war
the island was christianised from the <num> century onward
following the norman invasion in the <num> century england claimed sovereignty over ireland
however english rule did not extend over the whole island until the <num> – <num> century tudor conquest which led to colonisation by settlers from britain
in the <num> a system of protestant english rule was designed to materially disadvantage the catholic majority and protestant dissenters and was extended during the <num> century
with the acts of union in <year> ireland became a part of the united kingdom
a war of independence in the early <num> century was followed by the partition of the island creating the irish free state which became increasingly sovereign over the following decades and northern ireland which remained a part of the united kingdom
northern ireland saw much civil unrest from the late <num> until the <num>
this subsided following a political agreement in <year>
in <year> the republic of ireland joined the european economic community while the united kingdom and northern ireland as part of it did the same
irish culture has had a significant influence on other cultures especially in the fields of literature
alongside mainstream western culture a strong indigenous culture exists as expressed through gaelic games irish music and the irish language
the culture of the island also shares many features with that of great britain including the english language and sports such as association football rugby horse racing and golf
eriu derives from proto @-@ celtic iveriu compare welsh iwerddon which is also the source of latin hibernia
iveriu derives from a root meaning fat prosperous
sea levels were lower and ireland like great britain formed part of continental europe
by <num> @,@ <num> bc rising sea levels due to ice melting caused ireland to become separated from great britain
later around <num> bc great britain itself became separated from continental europe
the earliest evidence of human presence in ireland is dated at <num> @,@ <num> bc
until recently the earliest evidence of humans in ireland were mesolithic people who arrived by boat from britain between <num> bc and <num> bc
from about <num> bc neolithic settlers arrived introducing cereal cultivars a housing culture similar to those of the same period in scotland and stone monuments
a more advanced agriculture was to develop
at the céide fields preserved beneath a blanket of peat in present @-@ day county mayo is an extensive field system arguably the oldest in the world dating from not long after this period
consisting of small divisions separated by dry @-@ stone walls the fields were farmed for several centuries between <num> bc and <num> bc
wheat and barley were the principal crops imported from the iberian peninsula
the bronze age – defined by the use of metal – began around <num> bc with technology changing people 's everyday lives during this period through innovations such as the wheel harnessing oxen weaving textiles brewing alcohol and skilful metalworking which produced new weapons and tools along with fine gold decoration and jewellery such as brooches and torcs
according to john t
koch and others ireland in the late bronze age was part of a maritime trading @-@ networked culture called the atlantic bronze age that also included britain western france and iberia and that this is where celtic languages developed
this contrasts with the traditional view that their origin lies in mainland europe with the hallstatt culture
how and when the island of ireland became celtic has been debated for close to a century with the migrations of the celts being one of the more enduring themes of archaeological and linguistic studies
today there is more than one school of thought on how this occurred in ireland
the long @-@ standing traditional view once widely accepted is that celtic language ogham script and culture were brought to ireland by waves of invading or migrating celts from mainland europe
this theory draws on the lebor gabála érenn a medieval christian pseudo @-@ history of ireland along with the presence of celtic culture language and artefacts found in ireland such as celtic bronze spears shields torcs and other finely crafted celtic associated possessions
the theory holds that there were four separate celtic invasions of ireland
the priteni were said to be the first followed by the belgae from northern gaul and britain
later laighin tribes from armorica present @-@ day brittany were said to have invaded ireland and britain more or less simultaneously
lastly the milesians gaels were said to have reached ireland from either northern iberia or southern gaul
it was claimed that a second wave named the euerni belonging to the belgae people of northern gaul began arriving about the sixth century bc
they were said to have given their name to the island
a more recent theory with broad support among archaeologists is that celtic culture and language arrived in ireland as a result of cultural diffusion
this theory proposes that the celticisation of ireland may have been the culmination of a long process of social and economic interaction between ireland britain and adjacent parts of continental europe
the theory was advanced in part because of lack of archeological evidence for large @-@ scale celtic immigration though it is accepted that such movements are notoriously difficult to identify
some proponents of this theory hold that it is likely that there was migration of smaller groups of celts to ireland with sufficiently regular traffic to constitute a migration stream but that this was not the fundamental cause of insular celticisation
historical linguists are sceptical that this method alone could account for the absorption of the celtic language with some saying that an assumed processional view of celtic linguistic formation is an especially hazardous exercise
genetic lineage investigation into the area of celtic migration to ireland has led to findings that showed no significant differences in mitochondrial dna between ireland and large areas of continental europe in contrast to parts of the y @-@ chromosome pattern
when taking both into account a recent study drew the conclusion that modern celtic speakers in ireland could be thought of as european atlantic celts showing a shared ancestry throughout the atlantic zone from northern iberia to western scandinavia rather than substantially central european
ptolemy in his almagest refers to ireland as mikra brettania little britain in contrast to the larger island which he called megale brettania great britain
in his later work geography ptolemy refers to ireland as iouernia and to great britain as albion
these new names were likely to have been the local names for the islands at the time
the earlier names in contrast were likely to have been coined before direct contact with local peoples was made
the romans would later refer to ireland by this name too in its latinised form hibernia or scotia
ptolemy records sixteen nations inhabiting every part of ireland in <num> ad
the relationship between the roman empire and the kingdoms of ancient ireland is unclear
however a number of finds of roman coins have been made for example at the iron age settlement of freestone hill near gowran and newgrange
ireland continued as a patchwork of rival kingdoms but beginning in the <num> century ad a concept of national kingship gradually became articulated through the concept of a high king of ireland
medieval irish literature portrays an almost unbroken sequence of high kings stretching back thousands of years but modern historians believe the scheme was constructed in the <num> century to justify the status of powerful political groupings by projecting the origins of their rule into the remote past
the high king was said to preside over the provincial kingdoms that together formed ireland
all of these kingdoms had their own kings but were at least nominally subject to the high king
the high king was drawn from the ranks of the provincial kings and ruled also the royal kingdom of meath with a ceremonial capital at the hill of tara
the concept only became a political reality in the viking age and even then was not a consistent one
ireland did have a culturally unifying rule of law the early written judicial system the brehon laws administered by a professional class of jurists known as the brehons
however a united kingdom of gaelic ireland was never achieved
the chronicle of ireland records that in <num> ad bishop palladius arrived in ireland on a mission from pope celestine i to minister to the irish already believing in christ
the same chronicle records that saint patrick ireland 's best known patron saint arrived the following year
there is continued debate over the missions of palladius and patrick but the consensus is that they both took place and that the older druid tradition collapsed in the face of the new religion
irish christian scholars excelled in the study of latin and greek learning and christian theology
in the monastic culture that followed the christianisation of ireland latin and greek learning was preserved in ireland during the early middle ages in contrast to elsewhere in europe where the dark ages followed the decline of the roman empire
the arts of manuscript illumination metalworking and sculpture flourished and produced treasures such as the book of kells ornate jewellery and the many carved stone crosses that still dot the island today
a mission founded in <num> on iona by the irish monk saint columba began a tradition of irish missionary work that spread celtic christianity and learning to scotland england and the frankish empire on continental europe after the fall of rome
these missions continued until the late middle ages establishing monasteries and centres of learning producing scholars such as sedulius scottus and johannes eriugena and exerting much influence in europe
from the <num> century waves of viking raiders plundered irish monasteries and towns
these raids added to a pattern of raiding and endemic warfare that was already deep @-@ seated in ireland
the vikings also were involved in establishing most of the major coastal settlements in ireland dublin limerick cork wexford waterford and also carlingford strangford annagassan arklow youghal lough foyle and lough ree
it was led by richard de clare called strongbow due to his prowess as an archer
the invasion which coincided with a period of renewed norman expansion was at the invitation of dermot mac murrough the king of leinster
in <num> mac murrough had fled to anjou france following a war involving tighearnán ua ruairc of breifne and sought the assistance of the angevin king henry ii in recapturing his kingdom
in <num> henry arrived in ireland in order to review the general progress of the expedition
he wanted to re @-@ exert royal authority over the invasion which was expanding beyond his control
henry successfully re @-@ imposed his authority over strongbow and the cambro @-@ norman warlords and persuaded many of the irish kings to accept him as their overlord an arrangement confirmed in the <num> treaty of windsor
the invasion was legitimised by the provisions of the papal bull laudabiliter issued by adrian iv in <num>
the bull encouraged henry to take control in ireland in order to oversee the financial and administrative reorganisation of the irish church and its integration into the roman church system
some restructuring had already begun at the ecclesiastical level following the synod of kells in <num>
there has been significant controversy regarding the authenticity of laudabiliter and there is no general agreement as to whether the bull was genuine or a forgery
in <num> the new pope alexander iii further encouraged henry to advance the integration of the irish church with rome
henry was authorised to impose a tithe of one penny per hearth as an annual contribution
this church levy called peter 's pence is extant in ireland as a voluntary donation
in turn henry accepted the title of lord of ireland which henry conferred on his younger son john lackland in <num>
this defined the irish state as the lordship of ireland
when henry 's successor died unexpectedly in <num> john inherited the crown of england and retained the lordship of ireland
over the century that followed norman feudal law gradually replaced the gaelic brehon law so that by the late <num> century the norman @-@ irish had established a feudal system throughout much of ireland
norman settlements were characterised by the establishment of baronies manors towns and the seeds of the modern county system
a version of the magna carta the great charter of ireland substituting dublin for london and irish church for church of england was published in <num> and the parliament of ireland was founded in <num>
from the mid @-@ <num> century after the black death norman settlements in ireland went into a period of decline
the norman rulers and the gaelic irish elites intermarried and the areas under norman rule became gaelicised
in some parts a hybrid hiberno @-@ norman culture emerged
in response the irish parliament passed the statutes of kilkenny in <num>
these were a set of laws designed to prevent the assimilation of the normans into irish society by requiring english subjects in ireland to speak english follow english customs and abide by english law
by the end of the <num> century central english authority in ireland had all but disappeared and a renewed irish culture and language albeit with norman influences was dominant again
english crown control remained relatively unshaken in an amorphous foothold around dublin known as the pale and under the provisions of poynings law of <year> the irish parliamentary legislation was subject to the approval of the english parliament
english rule of law was reinforced and expanded in ireland during the latter part of the <num> century leading to the tudor conquest of ireland
a near complete conquest was achieved by the turn of the <num> century following the nine years war and the flight of the earls
this control was further consolidated during the wars and conflicts of the <num> century which witnessed english and scottish colonisation in the plantations of ireland the wars of the three kingdoms and the williamite war
irish losses during the wars of the three kingdoms which in ireland included the irish confederacy and the cromwellian conquest of ireland are estimated to include <num> @,@ <num> battlefield casualties
<num> @,@ <num> civilians are estimated to have died as a result of a combination of war @-@ related famine displacement guerrilla activity and pestilence over the duration of the war
a further <num> @,@ <num> were sent into indentured servitude in the west indies
some historians estimate that as much as half of the pre @-@ war population of ireland may have died as a result of the conflict
the religious struggles of the <num> century left a deep sectarian division in ireland
religious allegiance now determined the perception in law of loyalty to the irish king and parliament
after the passing of the test act <year> and with the victory of the forces of the dual monarchy of william and mary over the jacobites roman catholics and nonconforming protestant dissenters were barred from sitting as members in the irish parliament
under the emerging penal laws irish roman catholics and dissenters were increasingly deprived of various and sundry civil rights even to the ownership of hereditary property
additional regressive punitive legislation followed <year> <year> and <year>
this completed a comprehensive systemic effort to materially disadvantage roman catholics and protestant dissenters while enriching a new ruling class of anglican conformists
the new anglo @-@ irish ruling class became known as the protestant ascendancy
an extraordinary climatic shock known as the great frost struck ireland and the rest of europe between december <year> and september <year> after a decade of relatively mild winters
the winters destroyed stored crops of potatoes and other staples and the poor summers severely damaged harvests
this resulted in the famine of <year>
an estimated <num> @,@ <num> people about one in eight of the population died from the ensuing pestilence and disease
the irish government halted export of corn and kept the army in quarters but did little more
local gentry and charitable organisations provided relief but could do little to prevent the ensuing mortality
in the aftermath of the famine an increase in industrial production and a surge in trade brought a succession of construction booms
the population soared in the latter part of this century and the architectural legacy of georgian ireland was built
in <year> poynings law was repealed giving ireland legislative independence from great britain for the first time since <year>
the british government however still retained the right to nominate the government of ireland without the consent of the irish parliament
despite assistance from france the rebellion was put down by british and irish government and yeomanry forces
in <year> the british and irish parliaments both passed acts of union that with effect from <num> january <year> merged the kingdom of ireland and the kingdom of great britain to create a united kingdom of great britain and ireland
the passage of the act in the irish parliament was ultimately achieved with substantial majorities having failed on the first attempt in <year>
according to contemporary documents and historical analysis this was achieved through a considerable degree of bribery with funding provided by the british secret service office and the awarding of peerages places and honours to secure votes
thus the parliament in ireland was abolished and replaced by a united parliament at westminster in london though resistance remained as evidenced by robert emmet 's failed irish rebellion of <year>
aside from the development of the linen industry ireland was largely passed over by the industrial revolution partly because it lacked coal and iron resources and partly because of the impact of the sudden union with the structurally superior economy of england which saw ireland as a source of agricultural produce and capital
the great famine of the <num> caused the deaths of one million irish people and over a million more emigrated to escape it
by the end of the decade half of all immigration to the united states was from ireland
the period of civil unrest that followed until the end of the <num> century is referred to as the land war
mass emigration became deeply entrenched and the population continued to decline until the mid @-@ <num> century
immediately prior to the famine the population was recorded as <num>
<num> million by the <year> census
the population has never returned to this level since
the population continued to fall until <year> and it was not until the <year> census that the last county of ireland county leitrim to record a rise in population since <year> did so
the <num> and early <num> centuries saw the rise of modern irish nationalism primarily among the roman catholic population
the pre @-@ eminent irish political figure after the union was daniel o 'connell
he was elected as member of parliament for ennis in a surprise result and despite being unable to take his seat as a roman catholic
o 'connell spearheaded a vigorous campaign that was taken up by the prime minister the irish @-@ born soldier and statesman the duke of wellington
steering the catholic relief bill through parliament aided by future prime minister robert peel wellington prevailed upon a reluctant george iv to sign the bill and proclaim it into law
george 's father had opposed the plan of the earlier prime minister pitt the younger to introduce such a bill following the union of <year> fearing catholic emancipation to be in conflict with the act of settlement <year>
daniel o 'connell led a subsequent campaign for the repeal of the act of union which failed
later in the century charles stewart parnell and others campaigned for autonomy within the union or home rule
unionists especially those located in ulster were strongly opposed to home rule which they thought would be dominated by catholic interests
after several attempts to pass a home rule bill through parliament it looked certain that one would finally pass in <year>
to prevent this from happening the ulster volunteers were formed in <year> under the leadership of edward carson
their formation was followed in <year> by the establishment of the irish volunteers whose aim was to ensure that the home rule bill was passed
the act was passed but with the temporary exclusion of the six counties of ulster that would become northern ireland
before it could be implemented however the act was suspended for the duration of the first world war
the irish volunteers split into two groups
the majority approximately <num> @,@ <num> in number under john redmond took the name national volunteers and supported irish involvement in the war
a minority approximately <num> @,@ <num> retained the irish volunteers name and opposed ireland 's involvement in the war
the easter rising of <year> was carried out by the latter group together with a smaller socialist militia the irish citizen army
the british response executing fifteen leaders of the rising over a period of ten days and imprisoning or interning more than a thousand people turned the mood of the country in favour of the rebels
support for irish republicanism increased further due to the ongoing war in europe as well as the conscription crisis of <year>
the pro @-@ independence republican party sinn féin received overwhelming endorsement in the general election of <year> and in <year> proclaimed an irish republic setting up its own parliament dáil éireann and government
simultaneously the volunteers which became known as the irish republican army ira launched a three @-@ year guerrilla war which ended in a truce in july <year> although violence continued until june <year> mostly in northern ireland
it gave ireland complete independence in its home affairs and practical independence for foreign policy but an opt @-@ out clause allowed northern ireland to remain within the united kingdom which it immediately exercised as expected
additionally an oath of allegiance to the king was to be taken
disagreements over these provisions led to a split in the nationalist movement and a subsequent irish civil war between the new government of the irish free state and those opposed to the treaty led by éamon de valera
the civil war officially ended in may <year> when de valera issued a cease @-@ fire order
when de valera achieved power he took advantage of the statute of westminster and political circumstances to build upon inroads to greater sovereignty made by the previous government
the oath was abolished and in <year> a new constitution was adopted
this completed a process of gradual separation from the british empire that governments had pursued since independence
however it was not until <year> that the state was declared officially to be the republic of ireland
the state was neutral during world war ii but offered clandestine assistance to the allies particularly in the potential defence of northern ireland
despite their country 's neutrality approximately <num> @,@ <num> volunteers from independent ireland joined the british forces during the war four being awarded victoria crosses
the abwehr was also active in ireland
german intelligence operations effectively ended in september <year> when police made arrests on the basis of surveillance carried out on the key diplomatic legations in dublin including that of the united states
to the authorities counterintelligence was a fundamental line of defence
with a regular army of only slightly over seven thousand men at the start of the war and with limited supplies of modern weapons the state would have had great difficulty in defending itself from invasion from either side in the conflict
large @-@ scale emigration marked most of the post @-@ wwii period particularly during the <num> and <num> but beginning in <year> the economy improved and the <num> saw the beginning of substantial economic growth
this period of growth became known as the celtic tiger
the republic 's real gdp grew by an average of <num>
<num> per annum between <year> and <year> in which year the republic joined the euro
in <year> it was the sixth @-@ richest country in the world in terms of gdp per capita
social changes also occurred in this time most markedly with the decline in authority of the catholic church
the financial crisis that began in <year> dramatically ended this period of boom
gdp fell by <num> in <year> and by <num>
<num> in <year> the worst year since records began although earnings by foreign @-@ owned businesses continued to grow
the state has since experienced deep recession with unemployment which doubled during <year> remaining above <num> in <year>
northern ireland as part of the united kingdom was not neutral during the second world war and belfast suffered four bombing raids in <year>
conscription was not extended to northern ireland and roughly an equal number volunteered from northern ireland as volunteered from the south
one james joseph magennis received the victoria cross for valour
although northern ireland was largely spared the strife of the civil war in decades that followed partition there were sporadic episodes of inter @-@ communal violence
nationalists mainly roman catholic wanted to unite ireland as an independent republic whereas unionists mainly protestant wanted northern ireland to remain in the united kingdom
the protestant and catholic communities in northern ireland voted largely along sectarian lines meaning that the government of northern ireland elected by first @-@ past @-@ the @-@ post from <year> was controlled by the ulster unionist party
over time the minority catholic community felt increasingly alienated with further disaffection fuelled by practices such as gerrymandering and discrimination in housing and employment
in the late <num> nationalist grievances were aired publicly in mass civil rights protests which were often confronted by loyalist counter @-@ protests
the government 's reaction to confrontations was seen to be one @-@ sided and heavy @-@ handed in favour of unionists
law and order broke down as unrest and inter @-@ communal violence increased
the northern ireland government requested the british army to aid the police who were exhausted after several nights of serious rioting
in <year> the paramilitary provisional ira which favoured the creation of a united ireland emerged from a split in the irish republican army and began a campaign against what it called the british occupation of the six counties
other groups on both the unionist side and the nationalist side participated in violence and a period known as the troubles began
over <num> @,@ <num> deaths resulted over the subsequent three decades of conflict
owing to the civil unrest during the troubles the british government suspended home rule in <year> and imposed direct rule
there were several unsuccessful attempts to end the troubles politically such as the sunningdale agreement of <year>
in <year> following a ceasefire by the provisional ira and multi @-@ party talks the good friday agreement was concluded as a treaty between the british and irish governments annexing the text agreed in the multi @-@ party talks
the substance of the agreement formally referred to as the belfast agreement was later endorsed by referendums in both parts of ireland
the agreement restored self @-@ government to northern ireland on the basis of power @-@ sharing in a regional executive drawn from the major parties in a new northern ireland assembly with entrenched protections for the two main communities
the executive is jointly headed by a first minister and deputy first minister drawn from the unionist and nationalist parties
violence had decreased greatly after the provisional ira and loyalist ceasefires in <year> and in <year> the provisional ira announced the end of its armed campaign and an independent commission supervised its disarmament and that of other nationalist and unionist paramilitary organisations
the assembly and power @-@ sharing executive were suspended several times but were restored again in <year>
in that year the british government officially ended its military support of the police in northern ireland operation banner and began withdrawing troops
on <num> june <year> northern ireland 's deputy first minister and former ira commander martin mcguinness shook hands with queen elizabeth ii in belfast symbolising reconciliation between the two sides
they share an open border and both are part of the common travel area
both the republic of ireland and the united kingdom are members of the european union and as a consequence there is free movement of people goods services and capital across the border
the government is headed by a prime minister the taoiseach who is appointed by the president on the nomination of the lower house of parliament the dáil
members of the government are chosen from both the dáil and the upper house of parliament the seanad
its capital is dublin
the republic today ranks amongst the wealthiest countries in the world in terms of gdp per capita and in <year> was ranked the seventh most developed nation in the world by the united nations human development index
a period of rapid economic expansion from <year> onwards became known as the celtic tiger period was brought to an end in <year> with an unprecedented financial crisis and an economic depression in <year>
the executive is jointly headed by the first and deputy @-@ first minister with the ministries being allocated in proportion with each party 's representation in the assembly
its capital is belfast
ultimately political power is held by the uk government from which northern ireland has gone through intermittent periods of direct rule during which devolved powers have been suspended
northern ireland elects <num> of the uk house of commons <num> mps
the northern ireland secretary is a cabinet @-@ level post in the british government
along with england wales and scotland northern ireland forms one of the three separate legal jurisdictions of the uk all of which share the supreme court of the united kingdom as their court of final appeal
the north south ministerial council is an institution through which ministers from the government of ireland and the northern ireland executive agree all @-@ island policies
at least six of these policy areas must have an associated all @-@ island implementation bodies and at least six others must be implemented separately in each jurisdiction
the implementation bodies are waterways ireland the food safety promotion board intertradeireland the special european union programmes body the north south language body and the foyle carlingford and irish lights commission
the british – irish intergovernmental conference provides for co @-@ operation between the government of ireland and the government of the united kingdom on all matter of mutual interest especially northern ireland
in light of the republic 's particular interest in the governance of northern ireland regular and frequent meetings co @-@ chaired by the roi minister for foreign affairs and the uk secretary of state for northern ireland dealing with non @-@ devolved matters to do with northern ireland and non @-@ devolved all @-@ ireland issues are required to take place under the establishing treaty
the north south inter @-@ parliamentary association is a joint parliamentary forum for the island of ireland
it has no formal powers but operates as a forum for discussing matters of common concern between the respective legislatures
this has been facilitated by the two jurisdictions shared membership of the european union and there have been calls from members of the business community and policymakers for the creation of an all @-@ ireland economy to take advantage of economies of scale and boost competitiveness
there are two multi @-@ city regions on the island of ireland dublin @-@ belfast corridor <num>

a form of biomass energy this source of heat is still widely used in rural areas
however due to the ecological importance of peatlands in storing carbon and their rarity the eu is attempting to protect this habitat by fining ireland if they are dug up
in cities heat is generally supplied by heating oil although some urban suppliers distribute sods of turf as smokeless fuel
an area in which the island operates as a single market is electricity
for much of their existence electricity networks in the republic of ireland and northern ireland were entirely separate
both networks were designed and constructed independently post partition
however as a result of changes over recent years they are now connected with three interlinks and also connected through great britain to mainland europe
the situation in northern ireland is complicated by the issue of private companies not supplying northern ireland electricity nie with enough power
in the republic of ireland the esb has failed to modernise its power stations and the availability of power plants has recently averaged only <num> one of the worst such rates in western europe
eirgrid is building a hvdc transmission line between ireland and great britain with a capacity of <num> mw about <num> of ireland 's peak demand
as with electricity the natural gas distribution network is also now all @-@ island with a pipeline linking gormanston county meath and ballyclare county antrim completed in <year>
most of ireland 's gas comes through interconnectors between twynholm in scotland and ballylumford county antrim and loughshinny county dublin
a decreasing supply is coming from the kinsale gas field off the county cork coast and the corrib gas field off the coast of county mayo has yet to come on @-@ line
the county mayo field is facing some localised opposition over a controversial decision to refine the gas onshore
the republic of ireland has shown a strong commitment to renewable energy ranking as one of the top <num> markets for cleantech investment in the <year> global green economy index
research and development in ireland in renewable energy such as wind power has increased since <year>
large wind farms are being constructed in coastal counties such as cork donegal mayo and antrim
the construction of wind farms has in some cases been delayed by opposition from local communities some of whom overall consider the wind turbines to be unsightly
the republic of ireland is also hindered by an ageing network that was not designed to handle the varying availability of power that comes from wind farms
the esb 's turlough hill facility is the only power @-@ storage facility in the state
it is separated from the neighbouring island of great britain by the irish sea and the north channel which has a width of <num> kilometres <num> mi at its narrowest point
to the west is the northern atlantic ocean and to the south is the celtic sea which lies between ireland and brittany in france
ireland has a total area of <num> @,@ <num> km2 <num> @,@ <num> sq mi
ireland and great britain together with many nearby smaller islands are known collectively as the british isles
as the term british isles is controversial in relation to ireland the alternate term britain and ireland is often used as a neutral term for the islands
a ring of coastal mountains surround low plains at the centre of the island
the highest of these is carrauntoohil irish corrán tuathail in county kerry which rises to <num> @,@ <num> m <num> @,@ <num> ft above sea level
the most arable land lies in the province of leinster
western areas can be mountainous and rocky with green panoramic vistas
the river shannon the island 's longest river at <num> km <num> mi long rises in county cavan in the north west and flows <num> kilometres <num> mi to limerick city in the mid west
the island 's lush vegetation a product of its mild climate and frequent rainfall earns it the sobriquet the emerald isle
overall ireland has a mild but changeable oceanic climate with few extremes
the climate is typically insular and is temperate avoiding the extremes in temperature of many other areas in the world at similar latitudes
this is a result of the moderating moist winds which ordinarily prevail from the south @-@ western atlantic
precipitation falls throughout the year but is light overall particularly in the east
the west tends to be wetter on average and prone to atlantic storms especially in the late autumn and winter months
these occasionally bring destructive winds and higher total rainfall to these areas as well as sometimes snow and hail
the regions of north county galway and east county mayo have the highest incidents of recorded lightning annually for the island with lightning occurring approximately five to ten days per year in these areas
munster in the south records the least snow whereas ulster in the north records the most
inland areas are warmer in summer and colder in winter
usually around <num> days of the year are below freezing <num> ° c <num> ° f at inland weather stations compared to <num> days at coastal stations
ireland is sometimes affected by heat waves most recently in <year> <year> <year> and <year>
in common with the rest of europe ireland experienced unusually cold weather during the winter of <year> <num>
temperatures fell as low as − <num>
<num> ° c <num> ° f in county mayo on <num> december and up to a metre <num> ft of snow fell in mountainous areas
the island consists of varied geological provinces
in the far west around county galway and county donegal is a medium to high grade metamorphic and igneous complex of caledonide affinity similar to the scottish highlands
across southeast ulster and extending southwest to longford and south to navan is a province of ordovician and silurian rocks with similarities to the southern uplands province of scotland
further south along the county wexford coastline is an area of granite intrusives into more ordovician and silurian rocks like that found in wales
in the southwest around bantry bay and the mountains of macgillicuddy 's reeks is an area of substantially deformed but only lightly metamorphosed devonian @-@ aged rocks
this partial ring of hard rock geology is covered by a blanket of carboniferous limestone over the centre of the country giving rise to a comparatively fertile and lush landscape
the west @-@ coast district of the burren around lisdoonvarna has well @-@ developed karst features
significant stratiform lead @-@ zinc mineralisation is found in the limestones around silvermines and tynagh
hydrocarbon exploration is ongoing following the first major find at the kinsale head gas field off cork in the mid @-@ <num>
in <year> economically significant finds of natural gas were made in the corrib gas field off the county mayo coast
this has increased activity off the west coast in parallel with the west of shetland step @-@ out development from the north sea hydrocarbon province
the helvick oil field estimated to contain over <num> million barrels <num> @,@ <num> @,@ <num> <num> of oil is another recent discovery
a number of other places are on the tentative list for example the burren the ceide fields and mount stewart
some of the most visited sites in ireland include bunratty castle the rock of cashel the cliffs of moher holy cross abbey and blarney castle
historically important monastic sites include glendalough and clonmacnoise which are maintained as national monuments in the republic of ireland
dublin is the most heavily touristed region and home to several of the most popular attractions such as the guinness storehouse and book of kells
the west and south west which includes the lakes of killarney and the dingle peninsula in county kerry and connemara and the aran islands in county galway are also popular tourist destinations
achill island lies off the coast of county mayo and is ireland 's largest island
it is a popular tourist destination for surfing and contains <num> blue flag beaches and croaghaun one of the worlds highest sea cliffs
stately homes built during the <num> <num> and <num> centuries in palladian neoclassical and neo @-@ gothic styles such as castle ward castletown house bantry house glenveagh castle are also of interest to tourists
some have been converted into hotels such as ashford castle castle leslie and dromoland castle
there are <num> mammal species in ireland and of them only <num> land mammal species are considered native to ireland
some species such as the red fox hedgehog and badger are very common whereas others like the irish hare red deer and pine marten are less so
aquatic wildlife such as species of sea turtle shark seal whale and dolphin are common off the coast
about <num> species of birds have been recorded in ireland
many of these are migratory including the barn swallow
several different habitat types are found in ireland including farmland open woodland temperate broadleaf and mixed forests conifer plantations peat bogs and a variety of coastal habitats
however agriculture drives current land use patterns in ireland limiting natural habitat preserves particularly for larger wild mammals with greater territorial needs
with no large apex predators in ireland other than humans and dogs such populations of animals as semi @-@ wild deer that cannot be controlled by smaller predators such as the fox are controlled by annual culling
there are no snakes in ireland and only one species of reptile the common lizard is native to the island
extinct species include the irish elk the great auk and the wolf
some previously extinct birds such as the golden eagle been reintroduced in about the year <year> after decades of extirpation
until medieval times ireland was heavily forested with oak pine and birch
forests today cover about <num>
<num> of ireland of which <num> @,@ <num> km <num> or one million acres is owned by coillte the republic 's forestry service
as of <year> the republic is one of the least forested countries in europe
much of the land is now covered with pasture and there are many species of wild @-@ flower
gorse ulex europaeus a wild furze is commonly found growing in the uplands and ferns are plentiful in the more moist regions especially in the western parts
it is home to hundreds of plant species some of them unique to the island and has been invaded by some grasses such as spartina anglica
the algal and seaweed flora is that of the cold @-@ temperate variety
the total number of species is <num> and is distributed as follows <num> rhodophyta red algae <num> phaeophyceae brown algae including kelps <num> chloropyta green algae <num> cyanophyta blue @-@ green algae rarer species include itonoa marginifera j

the island has been invaded by some algae some of which are now well established
for example asparagopsis armara harvey which originated in australia and was first recorded by m
de valera in <year> colpomenia peregrina sauvageau which is now locally abundant and first recorded in the <num> sargassum muticum yendo fensholt now well established in a number of localities on the south west and north @-@ east coasts codium fragile ssp
fragile formerly reported as ssp
tomentosum now well established
codium fragile ssp
atlanticum has been established to be native although for many years it was regarded as an alien species
because of its mild climate many species including sub @-@ tropical species such as palm trees are grown in ireland
phytogeographically ireland belongs to the atlantic european province of the circumboreal region within the boreal kingdom
the island itself can be subdivided into two ecoregions the celtic broadleaf forests and north atlantic moist mixed forests
a land of green fields for crop cultivation and cattle rearing limits the space available for the establishment of native wild species
hedgerows however traditionally used for maintaining and demarcating land boundaries act as a refuge for native wild flora
this ecosystem stretches across the countryside and acts as a network of connections to preserve remnants of the ecosystem that once covered the island
subsidies under the common agricultural policy which supported agricultural practices that preserved hedgerow environments are undergoing reforms
the common agricultural policy had in the past subsidised potentially destructive agricultural practices for example by emphasising production without placing limits on indiscriminate use of fertilisers and pesticides but reforms have gradually decoupled subsidies from production levels and introduced environmental and other requirements
forest covers about <num>
<num> of the country most of it designated for commercial production
forested areas typically consist of monoculture plantations of non @-@ native species which may result in habitats that are not suitable for supporting native species of invertebrates
remnants of native forest can be found scattered around the island in particular in the killarney national park
natural areas require fencing to prevent over @-@ grazing by deer and sheep that roam over uncultivated areas
grazing in this manner is one of the main factors preventing the natural regeneration of forests across many regions of the country
the different eras are termed mesolithic neolithic bronze age and iron age
early historical and genealogical records note the existence of major groups such as the cruthin corcu loígde dál riata dáirine deirgtine delbhna érainn laigin ulaid
slightly later major groups included the connachta ciannachta eóganachta
smaller groups included the aithechthúatha see attacotti cálraighe cíarraige conmaicne dartraighe déisi éile fir bolg fortuatha gailenga gamanraige mairtine múscraige partraige soghain uaithni uí maine uí liatháin
many survived into late medieval times others vanished as they became politically unimportant
over the past <num> years vikings normans welsh flemings scots english africans eastern europeans and south americans have all added to the population and have had significant influences on irish culture
ireland 's largest religious group is christianity
the largest denomination is roman catholicism representing over <num> for the island and about <num> of the republic of ireland
most of the rest of the population adhere to one of the various protestant denominations about <num> of northern ireland
the largest is the anglican church of ireland
the muslim community is growing in ireland mostly through increased immigration with a <num> increase in the republic between the <year> and <year> census
the island has a small jewish community
about <num> of the republic 's population and about <num> of the northern ireland population describe themselves as of no religion
in a <year> survey conducted on behalf of the irish times <num> of respondents said they went to a religious service more than once a week
the population of ireland rose rapidly from the <num> century until the mid @-@ <num> century but a devastating famine in the <num> caused one million deaths and forced over one million more to emigrate in its immediate wake
over the following century the population was reduced by over half at a time when the general trend in european countries was for populations to rise by an average of three @-@ fold
in a system that developed between the <num> and <num> centuries ireland has <num> traditional counties
twenty @-@ six of these counties are in the republic of ireland and six are in northern ireland
the six counties that constitute northern ireland are all in the province of ulster which has nine counties in total
as such ulster is often used as a synonym for northern ireland although the two are not coterminous
in the republic of ireland counties form the basis of the system of local government
counties dublin cork limerick galway waterford and tipperary have been broken up into smaller administrative areas
however they are still treated as counties for cultural and some official purposes for example postal addresses and by the ordnance survey ireland
counties in northern ireland are no longer used for local governmental purposes but as in the republic their traditional boundaries are still used for informal purposes such as sports leagues and in cultural or tourism contexts
city status in ireland is decided by legislative or royal charter
dublin with over <num> million residents in the greater dublin area is the largest city on the island
belfast with <num> @,@ <num> residents is the largest city in northern ireland
city status does not directly equate with population size
for example armagh with <num> @,@ <num> is the seat of the church of ireland and the roman catholic primate of all ireland and was re @-@ granted city status by queen elizabeth ii in <year> having lost that status in local government reforms of <year>
in the republic of ireland kilkenny seat of the butler dynasty while no longer a city for administrative purposes since the <year> local government act is entitled by law to continue to use the description
a population of over <num> million in <year> was reduced to slightly more than <num> million by <year>
in part the fall in population was due to death from the great famine of <year> to <year> which took about <num> million lives
however by far the greater cause of population decline was the dire economic state of the country which led to an entrenched culture of emigration lasting until the 21st century
emigration from ireland in the <num> century contributed to the populations of england the united states canada and australia where a large irish diaspora lives
as of <year> <num>
<num> million canadians or <num> of the population are of irish descent
as of <year> a total of <num>
<num> million americans claim irish ancestry
with growing prosperity since the last decade of the <num> century ireland became a destination for immigrants
since the european union expanded to include poland in <year> polish people have made up the largest number of immigrants over <num> @,@ <num> from central europe
there has also been significant immigration from lithuania the czech republic and latvia
the republic of ireland in particular has seen large @-@ scale immigration with <num> @,@ <num> foreign nationals as of <year> about <num> of the population
a quarter of births <num> percent in <year> were to mothers born outside ireland
chinese and nigerians along with people from other african countries have accounted for a large proportion of the non – european union migrants to ireland
up to <num> @,@ <num> eastern and central european migrant workers left ireland in response to the irish financial crisis
both languages have widely contributed to literature
irish now a minority but official language of the republic of ireland was the vernacular of the irish people for over two thousand years and was probably introduced by some sort of proto @-@ gaelic migration during the iron age possibly earlier
it began to be written down after christianisation in the <num> century and spread to scotland and the isle of man where it evolved into the scottish gaelic and manx languages respectively
the irish language has a vast treasure of written texts from many centuries and is divided by linguists into old irish from the <num> to <num> century middle irish from the <num> to <num> century early modern irish until the <num> century and the modern irish spoken today
it remained the dominant language of ireland for most of those periods having influences from latin old norse french and english
it declined under british rule but remained the majority tongue until the early <num> century and since then has been a minority language although revival efforts are continuing in both the republic of ireland and northern ireland
gaeltacht or irish @-@ speaking areas are still seeing a decline in the language
the main gaeltacht areas are down the west of the country in donegal mayo galway and kerry with smaller gaeltacht areas near dungarvan in waterford navan in meath and the shaw 's road in belfast
irish language is a compulsory subject in the state education system in the republic and the gaelscoil movement has seen many irish medium schools established in both jurisdictions
english was first introduced to ireland in the norman invasion
it was spoken by a few peasants and merchants brought over from england and was largely replaced by irish before the tudor conquest of ireland
it was introduced as the official language with the tudor and cromwellian conquests
the ulster plantations gave it a permanent foothold in ulster and it remained the official and upper @-@ class language elsewhere the irish @-@ speaking chieftains and nobility having been deposed
language shift during the <num> century replaced irish with english as the first language for a vast majority of the population
less than <num> of the population of the republic of ireland today speak irish regularly outside of the education system and <num> of those over <num> years are classified as irish speakers
in northern ireland english is the de facto official language but official recognition is afforded to irish including specific protective measures under part iii of the european charter for regional or minority languages
a lesser status including recognition under part ii of the charter is given to ulster scots dialects which are spoken by roughly <num> of northern ireland residents and also spoken by some in the republic of ireland
since the <num> with the increase in immigration many more languages have been introduced particularly deriving from asia and eastern europe
in broad terms ireland is regarded as one of the celtic nations of europe alongside scotland wales cornwall isle of man and brittany
this combination of cultural influences is visible in the intricate designs termed irish interlace or celtic knotwork
these can be seen in the ornamentation of medieval religious and secular works
the style is still popular today in jewellery and graphic art as is the distinctive style of traditional irish music and dance and has become indicative of modern celtic culture in general
religion has played a significant role in the cultural life of the island since ancient times and since the <num> century plantations has been the focus of political identity and divisions on the island
ireland 's pre @-@ christian heritage fused with the celtic church following the missions of saint patrick in the <num> century
the hiberno @-@ scottish missions begun by the irish monk saint columba spread the irish vision of christianity to pagan england and the frankish empire
these missions brought written language to an illiterate population of europe during the dark ages that followed the fall of rome earning ireland the sobriquet the island of saints and scholars
since the <num> century the irish pubs worldwide have become especially those with a full range of cultural and gastronomic offerings outposts of irish culture

in the <num> century ireland produced four winners of the nobel prize for literature george bernard shaw william butler yeats samuel beckett and seamus heaney
although not a nobel prize winner james joyce is widely considered to be one of the most significant writers of the <num> century
joyce 's <year> novel ulysses is considered one of the most important works of modernist literature and his life is celebrated annually on <num> june in dublin as bloomsday
modern irish literature is often connected with its rural heritage through writers such as john mcgahern and poets such as seamus heaney
music has been in evidence in ireland since prehistoric times
although in the early middle ages the church was quite unlike its counterpart in continental europe there was considerable interchange between monastic settlements in ireland and the rest of europe that contributed to what is known as gregorian chant
outside religious establishments musical genres in early gaelic ireland are referred to as a triad of weeping music goltraige laughing music geantraige and sleeping music suantraige
vocal and instrumental music e
g
for the harp pipes and various string instruments was transmitted orally but the irish harp in particular was of such significance that it became ireland 's national symbol
classical music following european models first developed in urban areas in establishments of anglo @-@ irish rule such as dublin castle st patrick 's cathedral and christ church as well as the country houses of the anglo @-@ irish ascendancy with the first performance of handel 's messiah <year> being among the highlights of the baroque era
in the <num> century public concerts provided access to classical music to all classes of society
yet for political and financial reasons ireland has been too small to provide a living to many musicians so the names of the better @-@ known irish composers of this time belong to emigrants
irish traditional music and dance has seen a surge in popularity and global coverage since the <num>
in the middle years of the <num> century as irish society was modernising traditional music had fallen out of favour especially in urban areas
however during the <num> there was a revival of interest in irish traditional music led by groups such as the dubliners the chieftains the wolfe tones the clancy brothers sweeney 's men and individuals like seán ó riada and christy moore
groups and musicians including horslips van morrison and thin lizzy incorporated elements of irish traditional music into contemporary rock music and during the <num> and <num> the distinction between traditional and rock musicians became blurred with many individuals regularly crossing over between these styles of playing
this trend can be seen more recently in the work of artists like enya the saw doctors the corrs sinéad o 'connor clannad the cranberries and the pogues among others
since then there have been a number of stylistic fusions including folk metal and others while some contemporary music groups stick closer to a traditional sound
the earliest known irish graphic art and sculpture are neolithic carvings found at sites such as newgrange and is traced through bronze age artefacts and the religious carvings and illuminated manuscripts of the medieval period

the irish football association ifa was originally the governing body for soccer across the island
the game has been played in an organised fashion in ireland since the <num> with cliftonville f
c

it was most popular especially in its first decades around belfast and in ulster
however some clubs based outside belfast thought that the ifa largely favoured ulster @-@ based clubs in such matters as selection for the national team
in <year> following an incident in which despite an earlier promise the ifa moved an irish cup semi @-@ final replay from dublin to belfast dublin @-@ based clubs broke away to form the football association of the irish free state
today the southern association is known as the football association of ireland fai
despite being initially blacklisted by the home nations associations the fai was recognised by fifa in <year> and organised its first international fixture in <year> against italy
however both the ifa and fai continued to select their teams from the whole of ireland with some players earning international caps for matches with both teams
both also referred to their respective teams as ireland
in <year> fifa directed the associations only to select players from within their respective territories and in <year> directed that the fai 's team be known only as republic of ireland and that the ifa 's team be known as northern ireland with certain exceptions

for example whilst from the middle ages until the arrival of the potato in the <num> century the dominant feature of the irish economy was the herding of cattle the number of cattle a person owned was equated to their social standing
thus herders would avoid slaughtering a milk @-@ producing cow
for this reason pork and white meat were more common than beef and thick fatty strips of salted bacon or rashers and the eating of salted butter i
e
a dairy product rather than beef itself have been a central feature of the diet in ireland since the middle ages
the practice of bleeding cattle and mixing the blood with milk and butter not unlike the practice of the maasai was common and black pudding made from blood grain usually barley and seasoning remains a breakfast staple in ireland
all of these influences can be seen today in the phenomenon of the breakfast roll
the introduction of the potato in the second half of the <num> century heavily influenced cuisine thereafter
great poverty encouraged a subsistence approach to food and by the mid @-@ <num> century the vast majority of the population sufficed with a diet of potatoes and milk
a typical family consisting of a man a woman and four children would eat <num> stone <num> kg of potatoes a week
consequently dishes that are considered as national dishes represent a fundamental unsophistication to cooking such as the irish stew bacon and cabbage boxty a type of potato pancake or colcannon a dish of mashed potatoes and kale or cabbage
since the last quarter of the <num> century with a re @-@ emergence of wealth in ireland a new irish cuisine based on traditional ingredients incorporating international influences has emerged
this cuisine is based on fresh vegetables fish especially salmon trout oysters mussels and other shellfish as well as traditional soda breads and the wide range of hand @-@ made cheeses that are now being produced across the country
the potato remains however a fundamental feature of this cuisine and the irish remain the highest per capita consumers of potatoes in europe
an example of this new cuisine is dublin lawyer lobster cooked in whiskey and cream
traditional regional foods can be found throughout the country for example coddle in dublin or drisheen in cork both a type of sausage or blaa a doughy white bread particular to waterford
ireland once dominated the world 's market for whiskey producing <num> of the world 's whiskey at the start of the <num> century
however as a consequence of bootleggers during the prohibition in the united states who sold poor @-@ quality whiskey bearing irish @-@ sounding names thus eroding the pre @-@ prohibition popularity for irish brands and tariffs on irish whiskey across the british empire during the anglo @-@ irish trade war of the <num> sales of irish whiskey worldwide fell to a mere <num> by the mid @-@ <num> century
in <year> an irish government survey found that <num> per cent of whiskey drinkers in the united states had never heard of irish whiskey
irish whiskey as researched in <year> by the cnbc american broadcaster remains popular domestically and has grown in international sales steadily over a few decades
typically cnbc states irish whiskey is not as smoky as a scotch whisky but not as sweet as american or canadian whiskies
whiskey forms the basis of traditional cream liqueurs such as baileys and the irish coffee a cocktail of coffee and whiskey reputedly invented at foynes flying @-@ boat station is probably the best @-@ known irish cocktail
stout a kind of porter beer particularly guinness is typically associated with ireland although historically it was more closely associated with london
porter remains very popular although it has lost sales since the mid @-@ <num> century to lager
cider particularly magners marketed in the republic of ireland as bulmers is also a popular drink
red lemonade a soft @-@ drink is consumed on its own and as a mixer particularly with whiskey
the operation was undertaken by the royal navy and british commandos under the auspices of combined operations headquarters on <num> march <year>
st nazaire was targeted because the loss of its dry dock would force any large german warship in need of repairs such as the tirpitz to return to home waters via either the english channel or the giuk gap both of which were heavily defended by british units including the royal navy 's home fleet rather than having a haven available on the atlantic coast
the obsolete destroyer hms campbeltown accompanied by <num> smaller craft crossed the english channel to the atlantic coast of france and was rammed into the normandie dock gates
the ship had been packed with delayed @-@ action explosives well hidden within a steel and concrete case that detonated later that day putting the dock out of service for the remainder of the war and up to five years after
a force of commandos landed to destroy machinery and other structures
heavy german gunfire sank set ablaze or immobilised all the small craft intended to transport the commandos back to england the commandos had to fight their way out through the town to try to escape overland
they were forced to surrender when their ammunition was expended and they were surrounded
after the raid <num> men of the force of <num> returned to britain <num> were killed and <num> became prisoners of war
german casualties were over <num> dead some killed after the raid when campbeltown exploded
to recognise their bravery <num> decorations were awarded to members of the raiding party including five victoria crosses
after the war st nazaire was one of <num> battle honours awarded to the commandos the operation has since become known as the greatest raid of all within military circles
in <year> it had a population of <num> @,@ <num>
the st nazaire port has an outer harbour known as the avant port formed by two piers jutting out into the atlantic ocean
this leads to two lock gates before the bassin de st nazaire
these gates control the water level in the basin so that it is not affected by the tide
beyond the basin is the larger inner dock called the bassin de penhoët which can accommodate ships up to <num> @,@ <num> tons
there is also an old entrance to the bassin de st nazaire located southwest of the normandie dry dock
built to house the ocean liner ss normandie this dock was the largest dry dock in the world when it was completed in <year>
the old mole jetty juts into the loire halfway between the southern pier of the avant port and the old entrance into the basin
on <num> may <year> the battle of the denmark strait was fought between the german ships bismarck and prinz eugen and the british ships hms prince of wales and hms hood
hood was sunk and the damaged prince of wales was forced to retire
bismarck also damaged ordered her consort to proceed independently while she headed for the french port of st nazaire which was the only port on the atlantic coast with a dry dock able to accommodate a ship of her size
she was intercepted by the british and sunk en route
britain 's naval intelligence division first proposed a commando raid on the dock in late <year>
when the german battleship tirpitz was declared operational in january <year> the royal navy rn and royal air force raf were already drawing up plans to attack her
planners from combined operations headquarters were looking at potential scenarios if tirpitz escaped the naval blockade and reached the atlantic
they decided the only port able to accommodate her was st nazaire especially if like the bismarck she was damaged en route and needed repairs
they came to the conclusion that if the dock at st nazaire were unavailable the germans were unlikely to risk sending tirpitz into the atlantic
combined operations examined a number of options while planning the destruction of the dock
at this stage of the war the british government still tried to avoid civilian casualties
this ruled out a bombing attack by the raf which at the time did not possess the accuracy needed to destroy the dock without serious loss of civilian life
the special operations executive were approached to see if its agents could destroy the dock gates
they decided that the mission was beyond their capabilities because the weight of explosives required would have needed too many agents to carry them
the royal navy was also unable to mount an operation as st nazaire is <num> km <num> miles up the loire estuary
any naval ships large enough to cause sufficient damage would be detected well before they were within range
the planners then examined whether a commando force was feasible to accomplish the task
an unusually high spring tide was due in march <year> which would allow a light ship to pass over the sand banks in the estuary and approach the docks bypassing the heavily defended dredged channel
the approach was too shallow for an infantry landing ship but the planners believed if a destroyer could be lightened it might have a draft shallow enough to enable it to get through
the initial combined operations plan required two specially lightened destroyers to carry out the raid
the first would be packed with explosives and rammed into the dock gates
commandos on board would then disembark and use demolition charges to destroy nearby dock installations searchlights and gun emplacements
the destroyer would then be blown up and the second ship would come in and evacuate the ship 's crew and the commandos
at the same time the raf would carry out a number of diversionary air raids in the area
when the plan was presented to the admiralty they refused to support it
the certain loss of one or both destroyers to eliminate the dry dock was out of the question
they suggested they could provide an old free french destroyer the ouragan and a flotilla of small motor launches to transport the commandos and evacuate them afterwards
approval for the mission codenamed operation chariot was given on <num> march <year>
using a french ship would involve using the free french forces and increase the number of people aware of the raid
consequently it was decided the navy would have to provide a ship of their own
the raf complained that the raid would draw heavily on their resources the number of aircraft assigned by raf bomber command was reduced time and again before the day of the raid
british prime minister winston churchill further complicated matters when he ordered that bombing should only take place if targets were clearly identified
combined operations headquarters worked closely with several intelligence organisations to plan the raid
the naval intelligence division compiled information from a variety of sources
a detailed plan of the town of st nazaire was provided by the secret intelligence service and information on the coastal artillery nearby was sourced from the war office 's military intelligence branch
intelligence about the dock itself came from pre @-@ war technical journals
the rn 's operational intelligence centre selected the route and timing for the raid based on intelligence about the location of minefields and german recognition signals sourced from enigma decrypts and knowledge of luftwaffe patrols compiled by the air ministry 's air intelligence branch
when all the plans had been pulled together and the timing worked out the raid was expected to last no longer than two hours
the commandos and crew from campbeltown would board the motor launches at the old mole jetty and then return to base
the royal navy would therefore provide the largest contingent for the raid under the overall command of the senior naval officer commander robert ryder
the ship selected to ram into the dock gates was hms campbeltown commanded by lieutenant commander stephen halden beattie
campbeltown was a first world war destroyer and had previously been the uss buchanan in the united states navy
she had come into rn service in <year> as one of <num> destroyers transferred to the united kingdom under the destroyers for bases agreement
converting campbeltown for the raid took ten days
she had to be lightened to raise her draught to get over the sand banks in the estuary
this was achieved by completely stripping all her internal compartments
the dockyard removed her three <num> inch <num> mm guns torpedoes and depth charges from the deck and replaced the forward gun with a light quick – firing <num> pounder <num>
eight <num> mm oerlikons were installed on mountings raised above deck level
the bridge and wheelhouse were given extra armour @-@ plate protection and two rows of armour were fixed along the sides of the ship to protect the commandos on the open deck
two of her four funnels were removed and the forward two were cut at an angle to resemble those of a german destroyer
the bow was packed with <num>
<num> tons of high explosives which were set in concrete
it was decided that the explosive charge would be timed to detonate after the raiders had left the harbour
to prevent the germans towing her away the crew would open the ship 's seacocks before abandoning the ship
should she become disabled or sunk before getting to the dock four motor launches had been detailed to take off the crew and put the commandos ashore
the charge would be reset to explode after the last boat had left
other naval units involved were two hunt class destroyers hms tynedale l96 and atherstone l05 which would accompany the force to and from the french coast and remain out at sea during the raid
a motor gun boat mgb <num> was the headquarters ship for the raid with commander ryder and the commanding officer of the commandos on board
a motor torpedo boat mtb <num> commanded by sub @-@ lieutenant michael wynn had two objectives if the outer normandie dock gates were open she had to torpedo the inner dock gates
if the gates were closed she would instead torpedo the gates at the old entrance into the st nazaire basin
to assist in transporting the commandos <num> motor launches ml were assigned from the <num> and <num> motor launch flotillas
these boats were re @-@ armed with two oerlikon <num> mm guns mounted forward and aft to complement their twin lewis guns
at the last minute another four mls were assigned from the <num> motor launch flotilla see footnotes for flotilla details
these four boats were also armed with two torpedoes each
instead of transporting the commandos these boats were to engage any german shipping found in the estuary
all the mls had a <num> @-@ gallon auxiliary fuel tank fixed to the upper deck to increase their range
the s class submarine hms sturgeon would leave before the rest of the convoy and be in position to act as a navigational beacon to guide the convoy into the loire estuary
the man selected to lead the commando force was lieutenant colonel charles newman his no
<num> commando would provide the largest commandos contingent <num> men for the raid
the special service brigade headquarters used the raid to provide experience for their other units and <num> men were drawn from nos <num> <num> <num> <num> <num> and <num> commandos
the commandos were divided into three groups one and two would travel in the mls while three would be in campbeltown
under the command of captain hodgeson group one had the objectives of securing the old mole and eliminating the anti @-@ aircraft gun positions around the southern quays
they were then to move into the old town and blow up the power station bridges and locks for the new entrance into the basin from the avant port
the capture of the mole was a major objective as it was to be the embarkation point for the evacuation after the mission
group two under the command of captain burn would land at the old entrance to the st nazaire basin
their objectives were to destroy the anti @-@ aircraft positions in the area and the german headquarters to blow up the locks and bridges at the old entrance into the basin and then to guard against a counter @-@ attack from the submarine base
group three was under the command of major william bill copland who was also the commandos second in command
they were to secure the immediate area around campbeltown destroy the dock 's water @-@ pumping and gate @-@ opening machinery and the nearby underground fuel tanks
all three groups were subdivided into assault demolition and protection teams
the assault teams would clear the way for the other two
the demolition teams carrying the explosive charges only had sidearms for self @-@ defence the protection teams armed with thompson submachine guns were to defend them while they completed their tasks
the commandos were aided in their planning for the operation by captain bill pritchard of the royal engineers who had pre @-@ war experience as an apprentice in the great western railway dockyards and whose father was the dock master of cardiff docks
in <year> while part of the british expeditionary force in france his duties had included determining how to disable the french dockyards if they were captured
one of the dockyards he had studied was st nazaire and he had submitted a report detailing how to put the dock out of action
the port was defended by the <num> naval artillery battalion under the command of kapitän zur see edo dieckmann
the battalion was composed of <num> guns of various calibres from <num> mm to <num> mm railway guns all positioned to guard the coastal approaches
the heavy guns were supplemented by the guns and searchlights of the <num> naval flak brigade under the command of kapitän zur see karl @-@ konrad mecke
the brigade was equipped with <num> anti @-@ aircraft guns ranging in calibre from <num> to <num> mm
these guns had a dual role as both anti @-@ aircraft and coastal defence weapons
many were in concrete emplacements on top of the submarine pens and other dockside installations of the st nazaire submarine base
the harbour defence companies were responsible for local defence and for the security of the ships and submarines moored in the harbour
these companies and the harbour defence boats used to patrol the river were under the command of harbour commander korvettenkapitän kellerman
the <num> infantry division was the german army unit responsible for the defence of the coast between st nazaire and lorient
the division had no troops based in the town but some were located in villages nearby and would be able to respond to any attack on the port
the kriegsmarine german navy had at least three surface ships in the loire estuary a destroyer an armed trawler and a sperrbrecher minesweeper the latter being the guard ship for the port
on the night of the raid there were also four harbour defence boats and ten ships from the <num> and <num> minesweeper flotillas berthed in the basin while two tankers were berthed inside the normandie dock
the <num> and <num> u @-@ boat flotillas commanded by kapitänleutnant georg @-@ wilhelm schulz and korvettenkapitän herbert sohler respectively were permanently based in the port
it is not known how many submarines were present on the day of the raid
the submarine base had been inspected by the u @-@ boat commander in chief vizeadmiral karl dönitz the day before the raid
he asked what would they do if the base was subject to an attack by british commandos
sohler replied that an attack on the base would be hazardous and highly improbable
they formed into a convoy of three lanes with the destroyers in the middle
on arrival at st nazaire the portside mls were to head for the old mole to disembark their commandos while the starboard lane would make for the old entrance to the basin to disembark theirs
not having the range to reach st nazaire unaided the mtb and mgb were taken under tow by campbeltown and atherstone
on <num> march at <num> <num> tynedale reported a u @-@ boat on the surface and opened fire
the two escort destroyers left the convoy to engage the u @-@ boat later identified as u @-@ <num>
the u @-@ boat promptly dived and was unsuccessfully attacked by depth charges
the two destroyers returned to the convoy at <num> <num>
the convoy next encountered two french fishing trawlers
both crews were taken off and the ships sunk for fear they might report the composition and location of the convoy
at <num> <num> the convoy received a signal from commander @-@ in @-@ chief plymouth that five german torpedo boats were in the area
two hours later another signal informed them that another two hunt class destroyers hms cleveland and hms brocklesby had been dispatched at full speed to join the convoy
the convoy reached a position <num> nautical miles <num> km <num> mi off st nazaire at <num> <num> and changed course toward the estuary leaving atherstone and tynedale as a sea patrol
the convoy adopted a new formation with the mgb and two torpedo mls in the lead followed by campbeltown
the rest of the mls formed two columns on either side and astern of the destroyer with the mtb bringing up the rear
the first casualty of the raid was ml <num> which had developed engine trouble and was abandoned
at <num> <num> the submarine sturgeon directed her navigation beacon out to sea to guide the convoy in
at about the same time campbeltown raised the german naval ensign in an attempt to deceive any german lookouts into thinking she was a german destroyer
at <num> <num> on <num> march five raf squadrons comprising <num> whitleys and <num> wellingtons started their bombing runs
the bombers had to stay above <num> @,@ <num> feet <num> @,@ <num> m and were supposed to remain over the port for <num> minutes to divert attention toward themselves and away from the sea
they had orders to only bomb clearly identified military targets and to drop only one bomb at a time
as it turned out poor weather over the port <num> <num> cloud meant that only four aircraft bombed targets in st nazaire
six aircraft managed to bomb other nearby targets
the unusual behaviour of the bombers concerned kapitän zur see mecke
at <num> <num> on <num> march he issued a warning that there might be a parachute landing in progress
at <num> <num> on <num> march he followed up by ordering all guns to cease firing and searchlights to be extinguished in case the bombers were using them to locate the port
everyone was placed on a heightened state of alert
the harbour defence companies and ships crews were ordered out of the air raid shelters
during all this a lookout reported seeing some activity out at sea so mecke began suspecting some type of landing and ordered extra attention to be paid to the approaches to the harbour
each time she was able to pull free and the group proceeded on up toward the harbour in darkness
they had got to within about eight minutes passage from the dock gates when at <num> <num> the entire convoy was illuminated by the combined searchlights of both banks of the estuary
a naval signal light demanded their identification
the mgb @-@ <num> replied in a coded response obtained from a german trawler boarded during the vågsøy raid
a few bursts were fired from a shore battery and both campbeltown and mgb @-@ <num> replied ship being fired upon by friendly forces
the deception gave them a little more time before every german gun in the bay opened fire
at <num> <num> with the convoy <num> mile <num>
<num> km from the dock gates beattie ordered the german flag lowered and the white ensign raised
the intensity of the german fire seemed to increase
the guard ship opened fire and was quickly silenced when the ships in the convoy responded shooting into her as they passed
by now all the ships in the convoy were within range to engage targets ashore and were firing at the gun emplacements and searchlights
campbeltown was hit a number of times and increased her speed to <num> kn <num> km h
the helmsman on her bridge was killed his replacement was wounded and replaced as well
blinded by the searchlights beattie knew they were close to their objective
still under heavy fire the mgb turned into the estuary as campbeltown cleared the end of the old mole cut through anti @-@ torpedo netting strung across the entrance and rammed the dock gates striking home at <num> <num> three minutes later than scheduled
the force of the impact drove the ship <num> feet <num> m onto the gates
three demolition teams were tasked with destroying the dock pumping machinery and other installations associated with the dry dock
the kilt @-@ wearing captain donald roy the laird and his <num> @-@ man assault troop were tasked with inactivating two pump @-@ house roof @-@ top gun emplacements high above the quayside and securing a bridge to provide a route for the raiding parties to exit the dock area
roy and sgt don randall used scaling ladders and grenades to accomplish the former and a head @-@ on rush to secure the bridge and form a bridgehead that enabled capt
bob montgomery and lt corran purdon and their demolition teams to exit the area
they lost <num> men in this action
the fifth team also succeeded in completing all their objectives but almost half its men were killed
the other two commando groups were not as successful
the mls transporting groups one and two had almost all been destroyed on their approach
ml <num> was the only boat to land its commandos on the old mole and only ml <num> had managed to reach the gates at the old entrance to the basin
that team succeeded in planting charges on two tugboats moored in the basin
there were only two other mls in the vicinity ml <num> had continued past the dock and was engaging targets upriver ml <num> appeared to be out of control and was running in circles
by this time the crew of campbeltown had detonated the scuttling charges and gathered at the rear of the ship to be taken off
ml <num> came alongside the destroyer and took <num> men on board including beattie and some of the wounded
major copland went through campbeltown and evacuated the wounded towards the old mole not knowing that there were no other boats there to take the commandos off
lt col newman aboard the mgb need not have landed but he was one of the first ashore
one of his first actions was to direct mortar fire onto a gun position on top of the submarine pens that was causing heavy casualties among the commandos
he next directed machine @-@ gun fire onto an armed trawler which was forced to withdraw upriver
newman organised a defence that succeeded in keeping the increasing numbers of german reinforcements at bay until the demolition parties had completed their tasks
some <num> commandos were still ashore when newman realised that evacuation by sea was no longer an option
he gathered the survivors and issued three orders to do our best to get back to england not to surrender until all our ammunition is exhausted not to surrender at all if we can help it
newman and copland led the charge from the old town across a bridge raked by machine gun fire and advanced into the new town
the commandos attempted to get through the narrow streets of the town and into the surrounding countryside but were eventually surrounded
when their ammunition was expended their only option was to surrender
not all the commandos were captured five men reached neutral spain from where they eventually returned to england
the first ml in the starboard column was the first boat to catch fire her captain managed to beach her at the end of the old mole
some starboard boats managed to reach their objective and disembark their commandos
ml <num> the leading boat in the port column got to within <num> feet <num>
<num> m of the mole in the face of heavy direct fire and hand grenades before being set on fire
the crew were rescued by ml <num> one of the torpedo mls which had been looking for targets of opportunity such as the two large tankers reported to be in the harbour
the commanders of mls <num> and <num> lieutenants t boyd and t d l platt were awarded the distinguished service order for their bravery
the rest of the port column had been destroyed or disabled before reaching the mole
mls <num> and <num> were set on fire there were only six survivors
ml <num> was blown up one man survived
ml <num> the launch that had successfully taken off some of the crew from campbeltown was sunk on her way out of the estuary
ml <num> another torpedo @-@ armed boat had the unenviable task of moving up and down the river at high speed to draw german fire away from the landings
soon after passing campbeltown it was hit and its steering damaged
it took ten minutes to repair the steering
they turned and started in the other direction opening fire on an armed trawler in passing
return fire from the trawler set their engine on fire
ml <num> also came under heavy fire when it arrived near the port
sergeant thomas durrant of no
<num> commando manning the aft lewis gun engaged gun and searchlight positions on the run in
he was wounded but refused to leave the gun for treatment
the ml reached the open sea but was attacked at short range by the german torpedo boat jaguar
durrant returned fire aiming for the torpedo boat 's bridge
he was wounded again but remained at his gun even after the german commander asked for their surrender
firing drum after drum of ammunition he refused to give up until after the ml had been boarded
durrant died of his wounds and after the recommendation of the jaguar 's commander was awarded a posthumous victoria cross
after the commando headquarters group had landed commander ryder went to check for himself that campbeltown was firmly stuck in the dock
some of her surviving crewmen were being taken on board the mgb
ryder returned to the boat and ordered the mtb to carry out its alternative task and torpedo the lock gates at the old entrance to the basin
after a successful torpedo attack ryder ordered the mtb to leave
on their way out of the estuary they stopped to collect survivors from a sinking ml and were hit and set on fire
back at the docks the mgb had positioned itself in mid @-@ river to engage enemy gun emplacements
the forward <num> pounder was manned by able seaman william alfred savage
commander ryder reported that the rate of supporting fire had evidently been felt and the commandos in the area of the tirpitz dock had undoubtedly overcome the resistance in that area
there was an appreciable slackening in the enemy 's fire
ryder could see no ships other than seven or eight burning mls
he then realised that the landing places at the old mole and the entrance to the basin had both been recaptured by the germans
there was nothing more they could do for the commandos so they headed out to sea
on their way they were continuously illuminated by german searchlights and were hit at least six times by the german guns
passing ml <num> they ordered her to follow and made smoke to hide both boats
when they reached the open sea the smaller calibre guns were out of range and stopped firing but the heavier artillery continued to engage them
the boats were about <num> miles <num>
<num> km off @-@ shore when the last german salvo straddled them and killed savage who was still at his gun
he was awarded a posthumous victoria cross for his exploits
his citation recognised both savage and the bravery of the many unnamed crews of the motor gun boat motor torpedo boat and motor launches who continued to carry out their duties in exposed positions in the face of close range enemy fire
the two destroyers turned toward them and opened fire at a range of <num> miles <num> km
after ten minutes the german boats turned away making smoke
the destroyers sighted the mgb and two accompanying mls soon after and transferred their casualties to the atherstone
not expecting any more boats to arrive they headed for home
just after <num> <num> the hunt @-@ class escort destroyers hms brocklesby and hms cleveland arrived sent by commander @-@ in @-@ chief plymouth
shortly after this the ships were spotted by a heinkel <num> floatplane of the luftwaffe
the next german aircraft on the scene a junkers <num> was engaged by a raf bristol beaufighter which had appeared in the area earlier
both machines crashed into the sea
other german planes arrived but were driven off by beaufighters and hudsons from coastal command
the atlantic weather conditions deteriorated
amid concerns about the growing german threat and the realisation that the damaged small ships would not be able to keep up commander sayer ordered the crews off the smaller boats and had them sunk
three of the small vessels managed to return to england mls <num> <num> and <num>
they had reached the rendezvous and waited until <num> <num> for the destroyers to appear
having already been attacked once they moved further out into the atlantic to try and avoid the german air force but a junkers <num> appeared overhead at <num> <num> and approached them at low level for a closer look
the ships opened fire and hit the junkers in the cockpit
the plane went into the sea
the next aircraft to appear was a blohm and voss seaplane which attempted to bomb the ships but left after being damaged by machine @-@ gun fire
the surviving mls eventually reached england unaided the following day
reports vary on the fate of the two tankers that were in the dock they were either swept away by the wall of water and sunk or swept to the far end of the dock but not sunk
a party of <num> senior german officers and civilians who were on a tour of campbeltown were killed
in total the explosion killed about <num> men
the wreck of campbeltown could still be seen inside the dry dock months later when raf photo reconnaissance planes were sent to photograph the port
according to captain robert montgomery royal engineers attached to no
<num> commando campbeltown was meant to have detonated at <num> 30am the delay caused he believes by some of the acid in the pencil fuses being distilled away
as the morning progressed more and more captured comrades joined him in the german hq
the day after the explosion organisation todt workers were assigned to clean up the debris and wreckage
on <num> march at <num> <num> the torpedoes from mtb <num> which were on a delayed fuse setting exploded at the old entrance into the basin
this raised alarms among the germans
the organisation todt workers ran away from the dock area
german guards mistaking their khaki uniforms for british uniforms opened fire killing some of them
the germans also thought that some commandos were still hiding in the town and made a street by street search during which some townspeople were also killed
the st nazaire raid had been a success but at a cost
of the <num> men of the royal navy and commandos who took part in the raid only <num> men returned to england
five commandos escaped via neutral spain and gibraltar with the help of french citizens and took a ship to england from gibraltar
<num> men were killed <num> rn and <num> commandos and another <num> became prisoners of war <num> rn and <num> commandos
they were first taken to la baule and then sent to stalag <num> at rennes
the fallen british raiders were buried at the la baule @-@ escoublac cemetery with military honours
the cemetery is located <num> kilometres west of st nazaire
to recognise their achievement <num> decorations were awarded for the raid
this total includes the five victoria crosses awarded to lieutenant commander beattie lieutenant colonel newman and commander ryder and posthumous awards to sergeant durrant and able seaman savage
four distinguished service orders were awarded to major william copland captain donald roy lieutenant t boyd and lieutenant t d l platt
other decorations awarded were four conspicuous gallantry medals five distinguished conduct medals <num> distinguished service crosses <num> military crosses <num> distinguished service medals and <num> military medals
four men were awarded the croix de guerre by france and another <num> were mentioned in despatches
adolf hitler was furious that the british had been able to sail a flotilla of ships up the loire unhindered
his immediate reaction was to dismiss generaloberst carl hilpert chief @-@ of @-@ staff to the commander in chief west
the raid refocused german attention on the atlantic wall and special attention was given to ports to prevent any repeat of the raid
by june <year> the germans began using concrete to fortify gun emplacements and bunkers in quantities previously only used in u @-@ boat pens
hitler laid out new plans in a meeting with armaments minister albert speer in august <year> calling for the construction of <num> @,@ <num> bunkers by may <year> to defend the atlantic coast from norway to spain
the battleship tirpitz never entered the atlantic
she remained in norwegian fjords to threaten allied shipping until she was destroyed by the raf on <num> november <year>
the raid has since been called the greatest raid of all
the survivors formed their own association the st nazaire society which is a registered charity in the united kingdom
a memorial to the raid erected in falmouth bears the following inscription a new hms campbeltown a type <num> frigate was launched on <num> october <year>
she carried the ship 's bell from the first campbeltown which was rescued during the raid and had been presented to the town of campbelltown pennsylvania at the end of the second world war
in <year> the people of campbelltown voted to lend the bell to the new ship for as long as she remained in royal navy service
the bell was returned to the town on <num> june <year> when hms campbeltown was decommissioned
on <num> september <year> a tree and seat at the national memorial arboretum were dedicated to the men of the raid
the film follows the career of an ex @-@ us navy destroyer hms ballantrae actually hms leamington the raid is named operation boadicea and portrays the main events of the actual battle
the war film attack on the iron coast was released in <year> and was a highly fictionalized version of the raid
in <year> jeremy clarkson presented the story of the raid in a bbc documentary entitled the greatest raid of all time
an episode of the television series world war ii 's greatest raids on the military channel now the american heroes channel devoted an episode to this raid

its central character is the streetwise magician john constantine who was created by alan moore and stephen r
bissette and first appeared as a supporting character in the saga of the swamp thing <num> june <year> during that creative team 's run on that title
hellblazer had been published continuously since january <year> and was vertigo 's longest running title the only remaining publication from the imprint 's launch
in <year> the series concluded with issue <num> and has been replaced by a dc universe title constantine
well known for its political and social commentary the series has spawned a film adaptation television show novels multiple spin @-@ offs and crossovers
the series was the longest @-@ running and one of the most successful titles of dc 's vertigo imprint and was the stepping stone to many british writers
notable writers who have contributed to the series include jamie delano garth ennis paul jenkins warren ellis grant morrison neil gaiman mike carey andy diggle and peter milligan
hellblazer was one of the first modern occult detective fiction works and heavily influenced the genre to come
the series was intended to bear the title hellraiser but this title was revised before publication due to the contemporaneous release of clive barker 's unrelated film of the same name
initial writer jamie delano was in his own words fairly ambivalent about the change of title
the initial creative team was writer jamie delano and artist john ridgway with dave mckean supplying distinctive painted and collage covers
delano introduced a political aspect to the character about which he stated
generally i was interested in commenting on <num> britain
that was where i was living it was shit and i wanted to tell everybody
the book originally published as a regular dc comics title became a vertigo title with the imprint 's launch in march <year> issue <num> of the series
in october <year> it was announced that this would join dc titles in being published digitally on the same day as its physical release starting in january <year>
other writers who wrote for the series include paul jenkins warren ellis brian azzarello neil gaiman grant morrison denise mina and peter milligan
numerous artists worked on the series as well such as john ridgway the original series artist simon bisley mark buckingham richard corben steve dillon marcelo frusin jock david lloyd leonardo manco and sean phillips
cover artists included dave mckean who designed the first run of the series covers tim bradstreet who designed the most glenn fabry kent williams david lloyd and sean phillips
although issue <num> made a passing reference to superheroes the series since developed its own pocket universe in which the supernatural or paranormal did not play a large role in the lives of most ordinary people and in earth @-@ threatening circumstances no superhero interventions were shown or hinted at suggesting that superheroes no longer existed there
however some dc comics characters — most notably the fringe supernatural characters such as zatanna the phantom stranger shade the changing man dream of the endless and swamp thing made appearances
john constantine the main character of hellblazer was portrayed as a kind of confidence man and occult detective who did morally questionable things arguably for the greater good
he usually triumphed through guile deceit and misdirection but often made more enemies in the process than he defeated
indeed it was a common theme in the book that constantine was unable to effect any lasting change or enjoy unequivocal victories
while sometimes striving for the good of mankind constantine was often manipulative and a dangerous person to have as a friend as the lives and souls of those around him became perilously involved in his misadventures
he took pains to protect himself from direct attacks but his friends and relatives were often endangered in order to strike at him
the spirits of deceased friends haunted him individually or as an entourage of ghosts
constantine made appearances in other comic book titles such as crisis on infinite earths infinite crisis green arrow green lantern the sandman lucifer and shade the changing man
he was a recurring supporting character in both swamp thing and the books of magic throughout their numerous incarnations
some attempts to use the character in other superhero or family @-@ friendly comics were altered due to editorial mandate such as gregori eilovotich rasputin in firestorm and captain atom who refers to constantine as an impertinent bumbler in england
grant morrison created willoughby kipling for doom patrol after being refused constantine by dc changing his appearance to that of richard e grant in withnail and i following which phil foglio was forced to create ambroise bierce in stanley and his monster having been refused both constantine and willoughby kipling
john constantine was reintroduced into the dc universe in <year> initially in the brightest day crossover event title search for the swamp thing and in the ongoing the new <num> title justice league dark
r
quinch for <year> ad a title made popular by john constantine 's creator alan moore delano was selected to start the character 's first run in his own comic by then editor karen berger in <year>
delano 's run was characterised by his political satire taking on late <num> and <num> tropes such as with city financiers being literal demons and constantine meeting with freemasons from the houses of parliament
he also had environmentalist issues crop up especially in the fear machine issues <num> @-@ <num> where john fell in with a travelling community of environmental activists
indeed editor karen berger noted on delano 's departure the irony that his final issue was handed in the week that margaret thatcher was forced out of office
there were five main storylines in the run
the first collected as original sins deals with john travelling to america to exorcise a demon mnemoth and investigate a strange cult known as damnation 's army crossing paths with a demon called nergal from whom he gains demon blood and having to be responsible for killing an old friend gary lester and betraying another called zed in the process
the following four issues the devil you know finally explain john 's failure to save a young girl astra from a demon in newcastle an event that left him near insane and incarcerated in an asylum known as ravenscar and still haunted him to the comic 's end
he eventually discovers that the demon responsible for this was nergal and uses a technological scheme to trap him and lead him back to hell
it also contains a crossover with swamp thing where constantine loses his body while the swamp thing uses it to procreate
this was followed by a lengthy nine @-@ issue story arc the fear machine revolving around a masonic plot to collect people 's fears in order to resurrect a cthulhian god known as juntakillokian and his efforts to prevent this with the help of environmentalists including mercury a young psychic girl and marj her mother with whom he becomes romantically involved
the penultimate major run of delano 's tenure was the family man which differed from the main body of the series thus far in that constantine 's nemesis is not supernatural beyond an opening metafictional encounter with a fictional fence but a former policeman turned serial killer
john 's ethical quandary as to whether murder is ever acceptable and his coping with the murder of his father thomas frames this story
during this run on the title grant morrison issues <num> <num> and neil gaiman issue <num> both filled in during a three @-@ month break grant morrison 's story dealing with nuclear fear and neil gaiman 's being a simple romantic ghost story
delano 's run ended with the golden child where john is reunited with marj and mercury who help him discover that he murdered his more perfect twin in the womb culminating in an extended story in which we are shown what would have occurred had the other twin survived in his place
during his run there was also a stand @-@ alone issue the hellblazer annual <num> exploring constantine 's ancestry and featuring the video to john 's punk band mucous membrane 's song venus of the hardsell
jamie delano returned to the title on several occasions
between the garth ennis and paul jenkins runs on hellblazer he finally told the story of why john 's best friend chas owes him and he returned again for one of the five christmas stories in issue <num>
he also wrote the mini series the horrorist in <year> and bad blood in <year> both featuring john constantine
a more substantial return was made in <year> for a hardcover graphic novel hellblazer pandemonium with artist jock to commemorate the <num> anniversary of john constantine 's first appearance in swamp thing
he proceeded to write the longest run for any writer on the title
his take on the title was more personal than jamie delano 's with john 's relationships coming to the fore
it also had a strong religious theme with john 's dealings with the first of the fallen and some storylines such as the relationship between an angel tali and a succubus demon ellie would go on to be used again as a major plot device in preacher one of his most popular works
he also references the music of the pogues and the poetry of brendan behan both of these being relevant to ennis irish heritage
his run started with dangerous habits <num> @-@ <num> which was the basis for the <year> film constantine and dealt with john constantine contracting lung cancer and the desperate deal he makes with the first of the fallen and various other lords of hell to save himself
in the course of trying to save himself he visits ireland where he becomes reacquainted with kit ryan an old friend
the following few issues follow the early stages of his relationship with kit a plot to install a demon on the british throne in the plotline royal blood and in the extended issue <num> his first meeting with the king of the vampires
one minor story in this arc issue <num> was written by guest writer john smith
the next major arc fear and loathing issues <num> @-@ <num> covers a high point of john 's personal life with his relationship with kit going well and a fortieth birthday party where his friends ellie zatanna and the swamp thing attend and use their various abilities to create a large quantity of bushmills whiskey and marijuana
the story then takes him to his lowest point through his dealings with the national front their threats towards kit and her leaving him to return to ireland
following this john is defeated and lives homeless on the streets drinking to forget his life
this remains the case until the king of the vampires hunts him out and is poisoned by his demon blood leaving him out in the sun at dawn killing him
following his recovery the storyline damnation 's flame issues <num> – <num> follows a trip to the us where constantine is put into an alternative america by his old adversary papa midnite a vodun shaman
he is accompanied by the spirit of jfk who has to hold his brain in place from his infamous wound
he eventually learns how to escape shortly before running into the first of the fallen in the guise of abraham lincoln
there then follows a small break where he meets the spirit of a dead friend in dublin offering some closure to his recent problems
ennis run ends with rake at the gates of hell a story which finally brings together the racism storyline with riots in mile end echoing the real @-@ life brixton and broadwater farm riots in london the revenge attempt of the first of the fallen started in dangerous habits and the end of john 's relationship with kit ryan
john 's eventual pyrrhic victory leaves this run with closure and a relatively clean slate for a new writer to take over
following a brief interlude by from hell artist eddie campbell the series direction was taken over by paul jenkins in <year>
he had been former editor of teenage mutant ninja turtles and other mirage studios lines
he had pitched to several comic houses having tired of editing and eventually managed to gain stewardship of hellblazer the first largely untested writer to achieve this
his four @-@ year run is the longest run to remain uncollected
jenkins run is more traditionally english in its themes with albion arthurian legend and old english battles all featuring and even an appearance by samuel taylor coleridge and a speculative explanation of the writing of kubla khan and what the interruption of the man from porlock may have been
he also returns to jamie delano 's coverage of anarchist lifestyles and the effects of the criminal justice act of <year> a controversial law which restricted the ability of the public to throw raves and large demonstrations
major storylines in this run include critical mass where constantine is forced to use magic to purge his darker side into another human body in order to avoid being damned to hell as part of a trade to save the possessed son of a friend thus creating the antagonistic character demon constantine with the assistance of aleister crowley
the landmark hundredth issue gave more detail on john constantine 's father and the abusive relationship that they had shared
however it is unclear as to whether this is happening in reality or in his mind as john convalesces in a coma
last man standing reveals that his friend rich is the current descendant of king arthur and merlin 's attempt to discover god 's secret an act which would destroy england using john 's few remaining friends as bait
the tenth anniversary issue breaks from the usual format in breaking the fourth wall and addressing the reader as if they are in a pub with constantine for a monthly get together to hear his stories
over the course of the issue most of the characters from constantine 's history appear along with death of the endless from sandman
there are also appearances by writers and artists including series creator alan moore garth ennis and jenkins himself
jenkins run then draws to a close with two storylines up the down staircase and how to play with fire which relate the first of the fallen 's new plan to essentially let mankind ruin itself through television and consumerism and ellie 's plot to leave constantine friendless and alone
john eventually saves himself through a literal deus ex machina in a campfire conversation with god
however at that time rich and his family finally sever their friendship with john and the latter ends the run alone
paul jenkins later returned for one of the five stories in issue <num>
ennis briefly returned to the title in <year> with son of man filling the gaps between paul jenkins and warren ellis runs on the title
this more irreverent story is about the consequences of constantine resurrecting the dead son of an east london gangster using the spirit of a demon
he also had two specials published during his run on the title the hellblazer special and heartland which follows kit ryan 's return to ireland
he was meant to become a full @-@ time writer for several years as delano ennis and jenkins before him but left the title early after dc refused to publish the story shoot about high school shootings following the columbine high school massacre despite the fact it had been written and submitted prior to the event
the story was finally published in <year>
his brief run began with haunted a london @-@ based story in which john investigates the brutal murder of a former girlfriend isabel by an aleister crowley style magician josh wright
the story introduces or reintroduces many characters who became an important part of the hellblazer universe including inspector watford originally from jamie delano 's run on the title aging magician clarice and map a powerful magician who works on tube renovations in his part as custodian of london
the remainder of ellis brief tenure was taken up with single issue stories collected as setting sun
azzarello 's run is one large meta @-@ story that follows john constantine on a trip across america starting with his incarceration in prison then variously uncovering a pornography ring catching a serial killer taking on a neo nazi group before finally dealing with the architect of his incarceration stanley w
manor a thinly @-@ veiled pastiche of batman
brian azzarello did return for one of the five stories in issue <num>
carey 's run attempted to return john constantine to his roots with the title largely set back in london and featuring many characters from former runs on the title
mike carey also has the honour of being the first liverpudlian to write the liverpudlian character
his was the second longest run by any single author on the title second only to garth ennis
the start of his run introduces angie spatchcock a fellow magician and reintroduces his niece gemma constantine who has also fallen into magic use to her uncle 's consternation
after ridding his sister 's house of an evil spirit and finding out gemma has gone missing john returns to london to find his old colleagues and enemies are all taking sides in the hunt for a mythical item known as the red sepulchre
john eventually locates the item and finds gemma freeing her from his old enemy josh wright
following several forewarnings constantine then travels the world to set up a plan for a forthcoming tragedy which will occur when three doors are opened involving swamp thing and the garden of eden amongst others
john 's preparations have no effect however as he is tricked into killing the guardian that had been preventing the tragedy freeing a beast which can control the collective unconsciousness of mankind
john constantine cuts his own wrists in order to free himself from consciousness and plays a confidence trick on the beast allowing his friends time to use the collective consciousness to rebuild the guardian that had kept the beast trapped
however in this process swamp thing has his human soul removed setting up the fourth run of the comic relaunched shortly afterward
in the process john loses his memory setting up the events leading up to the <num> issue
leading up to the landmark issue john has little control over events and is led along by a psychic serial killer who threatens to kill chas and his family and a demon rosacarnis who offers his memories back at the cost of <num> hours in her service
john eventually gives into this offer and the <num> issue shows how rosacarnis manipulates his reality making him raise three children with her in the guise of kit ryan from garth ennis time on the title zed from jamie delano 's and angie from the current run with three different artists steve dillon marcelo frusin and leonardo manco each drawing one story as the past present and future of the title
carey 's final run followed the attempts of john 's three new children attempting to kill all of his family and friends culminating in the death of his sister cheryl at the hands of her possessed husband
john then travels into hell to try to rescue her soul with the assistance of rosacarnis father nergal
the plan ultimately fails and john returns broken and intending to renounce magic
mike carey returned to the title for a single issue between denise mina and andy diggle 's runs on the title and also wrote the well @-@ received hellblazer graphic novel all his engines about a strange illness sweeping the globe
her run on the title took john to scotland to attempt to stop a plot to make everybody empathise with each other
however john fails to stop this and overwhelmed by the grief and horror they 're forced to empathically share suicides abound through the people of glasgow
with help from gemma constantine angie spatchcock and chas chandler a plan to reverse the problem is made as tension builds among the soldiers now surrounding the city
the soldiers keenly listen to a world cup match between england and portugal on the radio
when england loses the match it seems all is lost but the expected psychic riot fails to materialize
the soldiers are scottish so england 's loss is celebrated saving the day and proving there 's no source of joy like schadenfreude
he left the title in <year> after accepting an exclusive contract with marvel
the run starts by introducing two main antagonists an aging politician who is using a strange portal to enter other people 's minds and commit crimes and mako a cannibalistic mage who devours other magicians in order to obtain their power
constantine 's attempt to play them off one another only succeeds in making them join forces in a further plot
constantine then traps them both with considerable ease and questions how this has been so easy
it then becomes apparent that he has been manipulated by the golden child his twin who did not survive childbirth and has been manipulating events for the whole of the series including his battle with cancer and many other events
he declines his twin 's offer to merge souls suspicious that his twin has been weakening his will in past years to make him accept this offer choosing instead to take control of his own destiny
his run implemented several major changes including john constantine 's wedding and the loss of his thumb
in a rare change milligan 's run on the title starts with john living in domestic bliss with a nurse phoebe
over the course of the first storyline several new characters are introduced including epiphany greaves the alchemist daughter of a notorious london gangster and julian a babylonian demon
over the course of the run john dealt with a demon taking revenge on people involved in the liverpool dockers strike gone insane and sought help from shade the changing man after chopping off his own thumb seen phoebe die at the hands of julian and traveled to india to try to find a way of saving her
following this he realised that he was in love with epiphany and married her in the <num> issue
however the events of this wedding turned constantine 's niece gemma against him due to the demon constantine sexually assaulting her in the restroom
the strain of this traumatic incident turned her against john and she enlisted the help of a coven of witches to kill him which later came to a head when john was forced to fight off a brutal demon summoned by them using john 's iconic trenchcoat to target him
afterwards john 's coat which gemma sold on ebay began to manipulate its various new owners into murder suicide or other horrific acts until coming into the hands of a man from the u
s
who tried to kill john and epiphany
during the time the coat was missing john 's magical abilities had begun to go out of control
john eventually resolves this and he was re @-@ united with his coat
since this gemma and john have a very shaky relationship with one another and she began a sexual relationship with epiphany 's crime @-@ boss father terry in order to punish john
when he confronted her about this relationship though she told him that she would not stop unless he was able to retrieve her mother 's soul from hell
john agreed
in order to get his sister to leave hell john agreed to track down her son his adopted nephew in ireland
on october <num> <year> the series was announced as ending with issue <num> following which a new title constantine started at the main imprint of dc comics
by <year> constantine was contacted by the three fates who tell him that he will finally meet his end in five days
having lived a good and adventurous life he happily accepts his fate rather than trying to fight it like he always does
when the last day came constantine was ambushed and shot in his own home right in front of a horrified epiphany
after he died epiphany and finn had an affair as a way to comfort each other
john 's ghost saw them having sex in a graveyard and seemed to give his blessing making the fates decide that john wasn 't going to try to come back to life
then of course he did
he contacted epiphany and asked her to help resurrect him by making him cigarettes from his ashes which after he smoked them made him corporeal again
thinking to disappear and live happily ever after with epiphany they moved to a tiny house in ireland courtesy of finn that was totally off the grid and far removed from any apparent trouble the last place anyone would think to look for john
that didn 't last long though as john realized he can never run from his past
so john left epiphany in ireland and returned to england to confront gemma
he stole the last dart holding the concoction that killed his demon twin but ultimately gave it back to gemma and told her either she could kill him and live her life without him in but consumed with guilt for killing him or she could let him disappear from her life forever without any guilt for murdering him
gemma shot the dart at him but john disappeared
the final panel of hellblazer reveals john looking shocked and much older than we 'd previously seen him standing in a bar appropriately called a long journey 's end surrounded by people in front of a shelf full of bottles with the names of the comic 's staff over the years
he was to be part of a team including shade the changing man deadman and madame xanadu known as justice league dark
as part of the dc universe reboot in september <year> peter milligan started the title which featured an alternate version of john constantine as a prominent part of the team
milligan wrote eight issues of justice league dark with writer jeff lemire taking over on issue nine
on november <num> <year> dc announced that hellblazer would be cancelled following its <num> issue and would be replaced by constantine written by robert venditti and drawn by renato guedes starring the younger new <num> john constantine rather than the version from hellblazer depicted as being in his late <num>
the constantine series finally ended its run on its <num> issue in may <num> <year>
nonetheless the character would again star in another solo series entitled constantine the hellblazer written by ming doyle and art by riley rossmo and released in june <num> <year>
writer ming doyle expressed excitement in her chance to write constantine stating that the reason of putting the term hellblazer back to the character 's title was to take constantine back to what he was at the start
hellblazer mixes supernatural and real life horror akin to contemporary gothic with noire surrealism and occult detective fiction elements
unlike other comic books hellblazer is unique as it follows real time in its span of <num> years with its protagonist john constantine aging in every publication
because of this writers of the series often places their era 's culture and social commentary in their run
when jamie delano first wrote the series in the late <num> and early <num> his issues were heavily inspired by the era such as punk rock and the british economy
delano would be the first to put his political views in the series an element never before seen in mainstream comics such as his negative views of thatcher 's regime and by <year> includes the war on terror
this made john constantine different from other comic book characters at that time in that he fights the political and social injustice of great britain
when garth ennis took over writing he included his trademark representation of racism and religious fanaticism as well his depictions of the falklands war
the most controversial writer brian azzarello tackled issues such as neo @-@ nazism prison rape and homosexuality
during warren ellis run he included american school shootings in a one @-@ shot issue which led to a major controversy
in his run peter milligan managed to put punk ideology in the series with the protagonist trying to reacquire his former punk self while also characterizing the conservative government as a demon infestation with the punk subculture fighting against this supposed subversion and abuse
as such much of hellblazer 's horror often comes in the crisis and controversies of its time
being set in the uk many famous british personalities have appeared or made cameos such as sid vicious margaret thatcher aleister crowley and alan moore
as stated by warren ellis hellblazer 's major themes were cynicism nihilism and sudden violence with the protagonist oftentimes narrating the story in dark proses with occasional breaking of the fourth wall
in many story arcs every victory constantine makes has a negative side effect and often leads to tragedy
his friends family and others would be sacrificed or be caught in the crossfire many of them dead or have left him
john tries his best to make something good in his life but most of it leading to failure
while not attaining the sales of mainstream comics it had sustained healthy figures consistently being one of the top selling vertigo titles and was sustained by healthy sales of trade paperbacks
hillary goldstein of ign described it as sometimes surreal often provocative and almost always entertaining the adventures of the hellblazer are among the best vertigo has to offer
well @-@ known comic book writer warren ellis also praised the series as his favorite calling it as among the very best horror works of the <year> 's
andre borges from dna india listed it in the <num> must read graphic novels describing it as one of the first of its kind and that its writing and art work have been praised throughout its run
robert tutton of paste magazine listed the series at <num> in its <num> terrifying modern horror comics stating that constantine ’ s most frightening encounters have hewn close enough to that kernel of truth to remind readers that real life can be as terrifying as any succubus or demon spawn
jamie delano 's original run on the title is looked on fondly with journalist helen braithwaite stating his take on the character of john constantine has never been equalled
delano 's original sins graphic novel should be in every comic book fan 's collection
she added that his writing evokes an incredible sense of dread and terror in a reader
ign listed the title as one of the <num> best vertigo books calling john constantine as one of vertigo 's best characters
garth ennis run is also much loved particularly dangerous habits which was voted the best garth ennis story on comic book resources ahead of his work on preacher the boys and the punisher
in the same article brian cronin describes john 's one time love kit ryan as one of the series most memorable characters
the popularity of ennis and dillon 's run on hellblazer is also credited for vertigo agreeing to publish their seminal series preacher
empire magazine called dangerous habits storyline as rightly one of the most celebrated in comic book history
glenn fabry who was the cover artist during ennis run won an eisner ward for best cover artist in <year>
the creator of the protagonist alan moore praised jamie delano 's portrayal of the character commenting delano demonstrates brilliantly that english horror didn 't vanish with the fog and gas lit cobblestones at the end of the victorian era
moore also liked brian azzarello 's run on the series commenting that azzarello and corben captured the character down cold and to the life
the character received positive critical reception while starring in the series
empire magazine ranked constantine third in their <num> greatest comic characters of all time while ign ranked him <num> in their top <num> comic book heroes and the character ranked <num> in wizard magazine 's top <num> comic book characters of all time
i vampire writer joshua hale fialkov expressed sadness he would never get to write the real john constantine noted crime author and former hellblazer writer ian rankin stated that constantine was the only comic book character he ever wanted to write for and alan moore 's daughter leah moore expressing doubt that constantine could replace hellblazer among others
as a result dc co @-@ publisher dan didio issued a statement defending this decision stating that hellblazer 's had a long and incredibly successful run and that 's a tip of the hat to all the great creators that have worked on the book over the years
the new constantine series will return him back to his roots in the dcu and hopefully be the start of another incredible run
comic alliance described hellblazer 's cancellation as marking the end of an era for vertigo while adding it to be one of a handful of comics from the late eighties that helped comic books and their readers grow up
hellblazer boosted the popularity and image of the occult detective fiction genre and shaped it to its modern form
many modern examples of the genre such as hellboy supernatural grimm the originals and the dresden files have been influenced by it and many imitators of both the series and its character flourished such as criminal macabre gravel planetary and others
its elements and style have been used countless of times in other works and many analogues of the cynical john constantine have appeared
the dramatization consists of the john constantine character wandering through london and in the film ending experiencing a mystical epiphany of sorts
in <year> constantine was released a feature film that did not use the same title as the comic book in order to avoid confusion with the hellraiser horror franchise
the only links to the character of john constantine were the name and a plotline loosely based on the dangerous habits story arc hellblazer <num> – <num>
dc comics announced a sequel to the <year> constantine movie was in the works with producer lorenzo di bonaventura linked to the project
he stated i 'd love to do it
we want to do a hard r @-@ rated version of it
we 're going to scale back the size of the movie to try and persuade the studio to go ahead and make a tough version of it
in late <year> director guillermo del toro publicly discussed the notion of creating a film that would star john constantine alongside other dc vertigo characters such as zatanna swamp thing and more
a few weeks later it was announced that neil marshall would be directing the pilot
the series will follow constantine in his early years defending humanity against dark forces from beyond
on february <num> it was announced that welsh actor matt ryan whose credits include criminal minds suspect behavior and edward kenway in assassin 's creed iv black flag will play the role of constantine in the tv series pilot

the show ran for <num> episodes and on may <num> <year> nbc cancelled constantine after the end of its first season
it was later announced that the character of constantine as portrayed by ryan would be reappearing in the fourth season of the cw 's arrow
the song stranger in the mirror by ookla the mok is written from constantine 's point of view including a lyrical reference to the newcastle incident
the song venus of the hardsell which first appeared in hellblazer annual <num> and written by jamie delano was adapted by the rock group spiderlegs
fantasy fiction author john shirley is credited in making three hellblazer novels including the novelisation of the constantine film
the novel hellblazer war lord features constantine talking about another john constantine in an alternate universe who has black hair and lives most of his life in los angeles whilst giving a brief summary of the film 's plot

the quake occurred in the vicinity of the northern boundary where the caribbean tectonic plate shifts eastwards by about <num> mm <num>
<num> in per year in relation to the north american plate
the strike @-@ slip fault system in the region has two branches in haiti the septentrional @-@ oriente fault in the north and the enriquillo @-@ plantain garden fault in the south both its location and focal mechanism suggested that the january <year> quake was caused by a rupture of the enriquillo @-@ plantain garden fault which had been locked for <num> years gathering stress
however a study published in may <year> suggested that the rupture process may have involved slip on multiple blind thrust faults with only minor deep lateral slip along or near the main enriquillo – plantain garden fault zone suggesting that the event only partially relieved centuries of accumulated left @-@ lateral strain on a small part of the plate @-@ boundary system
the rupture was roughly <num> km <num> mi long with mean slip of <num>
<num> metres <num> ft <num> in
preliminary analysis of the slip distribution found amplitudes of up to about <num> m <num> ft using ground motion records from all over the world
a <year> earthquake hazard study by c
demets and m
wiggins @-@ grandison noted that the enriquillo @-@ plantain garden fault zone could be at the end of its seismic cycle and concluded that a worst @-@ case forecast would involve a <num>
<num> mw earthquake similar in size to the <year> jamaica earthquake
paul mann and a group including the <year> study team presented a hazard assessment of the enriquillo @-@ plantain garden fault system to the <num> caribbean geologic conference in march <year> noting the large strain the team recommended high priority historical geologic rupture studies as the fault was fully locked and had recorded few earthquakes in the preceding <num> years
an article published in haiti 's le matin newspaper in september <year> cited comments by geologist patrick charles to the effect that there was a high risk of major seismic activity in port @-@ au @-@ prince

port @-@ au @-@ prince according to an international studies professor at the university of miami was ill @-@ equipped before the disaster to sustain the number of people who had migrated there from the countryside over the past ten years to find work

on <num> january a one @-@ day conference was held in montreal to assess the relief effort and discuss further plans
prime minister bellerive told delegates from <num> countries that haiti would need massive support for its recovery from the international community

the <num> @-@ member international interim haiti reconstruction commission headed by bill clinton and haitian prime minister jean @-@ max bellerive convened in june <year>
that committee is overseeing the us <num>
<num> billion pledged internationally for the first two years of haiti 's reconstruction
the commission was critiqued by haitian groups for lacking haitian civil society representation and accountability mechanisms
half the representation on the commission was given to foreigners who effectively bought their seats by pledging certain amounts of money
an international development consultant contracted by the commission was quoted as saying “ look you have to realize the ihrc commission was not intended to work as a structure or entity for haiti or haitians
it was simply designed as a vehicle for donors to funnel multinationals ’ and ngos ’ project contracts
” the netherlands sponsored a project called radio555
the dutch radio channels 3fm radio <num> and radio veronica all broadcast under the name of radio555 funded by a contribution of € <num> million
several organizations of the us building industry and government such as the department of homeland security and the international code council among others reported that they were compiling a haiti toolkit coordinated by the national institute of building sciences
the toolkit would comprise building technology resources and best practices for consideration by the haitian government with the goal of creating a more resilient infrastructure to prevent future losses of life
immediately following the earthquake real medicine foundation began providing medical staffing in @-@ kind medical supplies and strategic coordination to help meet the surging needs of the health crisis on the ground
working in close partnership with other relief organizations real medicine organized deployments of volunteer medical specialists to meet the needs of partner hospitals and clinics at the haiti – dominican republic border and in port @-@ au @-@ prince provided direct funding medical supplies and pharmaceuticals to local health facilities and partner hospitals provided advisory services and coordination to local health facilities including physical therapy support and coordinated mobile health outreaches field clinics and food supplies to outlying villages overlooked in the relief effort

an estimated <num> million cubic yards <num> million cubic meters remained making most of the capital impassable and thousands of bodies remained in the rubble
the number of people in relief camps of tents and tarps since the quake was <num>
<num> million and almost no transitional housing had been built
most of the camps had no electricity running water or sewage disposal and the tents were beginning to fall apart
crime in the camps was widespread especially against women and girls
between <num> major charities us <num>
<num> billion had been collected for haiti for relief efforts but only two percent of the money had been released
according to a cbs report us <num>
<num> billion had been pledged for humanitarian aid and was used to pay for field hospitals plastic tarps bandages and food plus salaries transportation and upkeep of relief workers
by may <year> enough aid had been raised internationally to give each displaced family a cheque for us <num> @,@ <num>
in july <year> cnn returned to port @-@ au @-@ prince and reported it looks like the quake just happened yesterday and imogen wall spokeswoman for the united nations office of humanitarian affairs in haiti said that six months from that time it may still look the same
land ownership posed a particular problem for rebuilding because so many pre @-@ quake homes were not officially registered
even before the national registry fell under the rubble land tenure was always a complex and contentious issue in haiti
many areas of port @-@ au @-@ prince were settled either by tonton makout – duvalier 's death squads – given land for their service or by squatters
in many cases land ownership was never officially registered
even if this logistical logjam were to be cleared the vast majority of port @-@ au @-@ prince residents up to <num> percent did not own their homes before the earthquake
haitian grassroots groups advocated for the government to fulfill the right to housing as designated in the haitian constitution and for donor governments to support this as well
they also worked to push the international community to recognize the wave of evictions from camps that started as early as three months after the earthquake and to put protections in place but little was done in response
in september <year> there were over one million refugees still living in tents and the humanitarian situation was characterized as still being in the emergency phase according to the apostolic nuncio to haiti archbishop bernard auza
he went on to say that the number was rising instead of diminishing and reported that the state had decided to first rebuild downtown port @-@ au @-@ prince and a new government center but reconstruction had not yet begun
in october <year> refugees international characterized the aid agencies as dysfunctional and inexperienced saying the people of haiti are still living in a state of emergency with a humanitarian response that appears paralyzed
it was reported that gang leaders and land owners were intimidating the displaced and that sexual domestic and gang violence in and around the camps was rising
they claimed that rape of haitian women and girls who had been living in camps since the january earthquake was increasing in part because the united nations wasn 't doing enough to protect them
in october a cholera epidemic broke out probably introduced by foreign aid workers
cholera most often affects poor countries with limited access to clean water and proper sanitation
by the end of <year> more than <num> @,@ <num> had died at a rate of about <num> deaths a day
according to the report relief and recovery were at a standstill due to government inaction and indecision on the part of the donor countries
the report stated one year on only five percent of the rubble has been cleared and only <num> percent of the required basic and temporary houses have been built
house building on a large scale cannot be started before the enormous amount of rubble is cleared
the government and donors must prioritize this most basic step toward helping people return home
robert fox executive director of oxfam canada said the dysfunction has been aided unabated by the way the international community has organized itself where pledges have been made and they haven 't followed through and where they come to the table with their own agendas and own priorities
most donors provided funds for transitional housing but very little money for clearing rubble or repairing houses
fox said that in many instances rubble removal means it was moved off someone 's property onto the road in front of the property
according to a unicef report still today more than one million people remain displaced living in crowded camps where livelihoods shelter and services are still hardly sufficient for children to stay healthy
amnesty international reported that armed men were preying with impunity on girls and women in displacement camps worsening the trauma of having lost homes livelihoods and loved ones
on the first anniversary of the earthquake haitian @-@ born michaëlle jean who served as the governor general of canada at the time of the disaster and who became united nations educational scientific and cultural organization unesco special envoy for haiti on <num> november <year> voiced her anger at the slow rate of aid delivery placing much of the blame on the international community for abandoning its commitments
in a public letter co @-@ authored with unesco head irina bokova jean said as time passes what began as a natural disaster is becoming a disgraceful reflection on the international community
the interim haiti recovery commission led by former us president bill clinton and haitian prime minister jean @-@ max bellerive had been set up to facilitate the flow of funds toward reconstruction projects in april <year> but as of january <year> no major reconstruction had started
<num> billion pledged for reconstruction projects in <year> and <year> only <num> percent has been delivered
venezuela and the us which promised the major share of reconstruction funds have disbursed only <num> percent and <num> percent respectively
japan and finland are among the few donors to have fully met their pledges
the data shows that some crucial sectors face particularly large funding gaps
in <year> and <year> for example donors disbursed just us <num> million of the us <num> million in grants allocated to agriculture projects and only us <num> million of the us <num> million in grants allocated to health projects
only <num> percent of bilateral aid for reconstruction projects has gone through haitian institutions and less than <num> percent of relief funding has gone through the government of haiti
a january <year> oxfam report said that a half a million haitians remained homeless still living under tarps and in tents
watchdog groups have criticized the reconstruction process saying that part of the problem is that charities spent a considerable amount of money on soaring rents board members needs overpriced supplies and imported personnel
the miami herald reports
a lot of good work was done the money clearly didn 't all get squandered but a lot just wasn 't responding to needs on the ground
millions were spent on ad campaigns telling people to wash their hands
telling them to wash their hands when there 's no water or soap is a slap in the face
the institute of justice democracy in haiti let haiti live and the center for constitutional rights have recommended immediate changes to recovery efforts to ensure that critical human rights concerns are addressed
a report found that the conditions in the displaced persons camps are abysmal particularly for women and girls who too often are victims of gender ‐ based violence
they call for more oversight of accountability of reconstruction plans asking why have only <num> @,@ <num> transitional shelters been built to date despite a stated goal of <num> @,@ <num> in the first year
on <num> august <year> recovery was hampered due to tropical storm isaac impacting haiti 's southern peninsula
there it caused flooding and <num> deaths according to local reporting
as a result of the <year> earthquake more than <num> @,@ <num> haitians continue to live in tents and experienced the storm without adequate shelter
in late october with over <num> @,@ <num> still living in tent camps a second tropical storm hurricane sandy killed <num> and left large portions of haiti under water
at the <year> consultative group meeting of the global facility for disaster reduction and recovery gfdrr the haitian delegation shared a bottom @-@ up approach to disaster reduction and management based on community integration and sustainable development with a group of experts from approximately <num> nations
the cholera outbreak which began in october <year> has continued
according to u
s
centers for disease control and prevention it is considered the worst epidemic of cholera since the <year> outbreak in the democratic republic of the congo called zaire at that time
by august <year> it had killed over <num> @,@ <num> haitians and hospitalized hundreds of thousands more
more than <num> of haitians have had the disease
care of cholera patients remains inadequate with much now done in tent facilities with rows of cots for patient treatment
the united nations peace keeping force widely believed responsible for the cholera outbreak continues to refuse to accept responsibility however they have launched a <num>
<num> billion initiative to combat cholera and the construction of a <num> million teaching hospital in mirebalais which will employ <num> haitians and treat <num> @,@ <num> people
by the beginning of the year only a small part-- <num> million — of the total funds collected for aid had been spent on permanent housing with most of it-- <num>
<num> billion — going for short @-@ term solutions including tent camps temporary shelters and cash grants that paid a year 's rent
a <year> survey disclosed that of the <num>
<num> million haitians living in camps following the quake about <num> @,@ <num> remained in a total of <num> camps
fifteen percent of the camps had no basic protection services and <num> no health services
while <num> lacked functioning toilets this is higher than the population outside tent cities where <num> lack toilets
many camps remained at a risk for flooding and more than a third of the camps <num> were at risk for evictions
in a <year> statement the american red cross reported that almost all of the money collected for quake relief has been spent or is scheduled for making progress permanent by ensuring people can leave camps and return to stable communities which includes building new homes repairing homes completing a new hospital and clinic and signing an agreement for a second hospital
despite the claims of the american red cross that <num> @,@ <num> homes had been built the investigation discovered that only six had been built
the investigation reviewed hundreds of pages of internal documents and interviewed more than a dozen former and current staff members and investigated the organization 's claim that <num>
<num> million haitians had been helped back on their feet despite joel boutroue a haitian government advisor stating that this number would cover <num> percent of the urban area and observing that this would mean they had served every city in haiti
numerous other claims did not hold up under investigation and it was found that the project was riddled with multiple staffing changes bureaucratic delays and a language barrier as many of the red cross officials did not speak french or creole
general counsel for the american red cross david meltzer directed the investigators to their official statistics but would not elaborate on them
the public affairs office of the red cross disputed npr and propublica 's claims in an email and claimed that the investigative report could cause an international incident
the american red cross has handed over the rebuilding efforts to the haitian red cross

the game 's story focuses on a french adventurer 's journey to the moon in the <num> century and the ancient lunar civilization he subsequenfinds
voyage is loosely based on the novels from the earth to the moon and around the moon by science @-@ fiction author jules verne and the novel the first men in the moon by science @-@ fiction author h
g
wells
reactions to the game were generally mixed
in particular some reviewers praised it for immersing the player in the look and feel of the <num> century others have criticized it for featuring dated graphics and dull textures
while staying true to most adventure game conventions voyage has some unique features for its genre
these include two dexterity minigames which take advantage of the reduced gravity in the game 's lunar setting and an intelligence management system in which a score is assigned to the player for every puzzle he solves and for certain actions
the adventure company introduced this feature to motivate players to replay the game to increase their cumulative score
the player can move by clicking and can swivel the camera <num> degrees
there are several types of puzzle in voyage including those involving native plant life on the moon mechanical puzzles audio puzzles and mathematical puzzles
many of these puzzles require the player to decipher and use the native language of the moon
voyage features two unique dexterity minigames
using a low @-@ gravity setting the first minigame requires the player to collect floating bubbles in a can and the second requires the player to execute large jumps across the surface of the moon
these two minigames form only a minor part of the game
the game also has several timed sequences requiring the player to complete puzzles under a time limit
the consequence of failing a puzzle of this sort is death after which the player is able to return and replay the puzzle
players can also be killed as the result of taking incorrect actions related to the game 's story
a critical aspect of gameplay in voyage is the inventory system which allows the player to pick up and keep dozens of different items
however the maximum quantity of a given item that the player may keep in his inventory at any one time is three
one of the main uses of the inventory is to combine items together to make new items
this process of breaking and reforming items in the inventory comprises a large portion of the puzzle aspect of the game
the inventory can also be used to create meals which the player can consume this ability plays a major role in several puzzles
another use of the inventory is to create hybrid lunar plants which play a critical role in the earlier puzzles of the game
for each puzzle the player solves and for certain actions this score is increased and the selenites treat the player with more respect
during an interview with gamersinfo benoît hozjan managing director and co @-@ founder of kheops studio described the system saying in the same interview alexis lang the lead game designer at kheops commented that a low score does not mean that you are stupid in any way it just means that some pompous and bombastic lunar people think that your character is dumb this reflects the fact that the intelligence management system is designed primarily to earn the respect of the selenites
however hozjan also said that he hopes players will try to increase their score and certainly share their experience through forums
the adventure company has marketed the system as bringing a degree of replay value to voyage as players can replay the game to achieve a higher score
president barbicane of the gun club decides to build an enormous cannon in baltimore to shoot a shell capable of supporting human life towards the moon in the hopes of a successful landing
voyage 's protagonist michel ardan volunteers to travel in the aluminium shell
after the game 's brief introduction in the shell ardan lands on the moon and discovers the selenites as well as a complex ecosystem of lunar plants
the main accessible areas in the game are the moon 's surface and the underground selenite civilization
the selenites are the subterranean inhabitants of the moon and are a highly intelligent society maintained by hierarchy and secret
they possess blue skin large black eyes and transparent cerebral lobes on the sides of their heads
this is in fact a reference to h
g
wells book the first men in the moon as the adventurers never actually land on the moon in verne 's original story
they are divided into castes
the selenites live in a large complex under the surface of the moon from which they rarely venture with the exception of the exiles
the selenites banish these dregs of their society the criminals and psychotics to the surface of the moon
there are three selenite exiles with whom the player can interact they live on the surface and sleep in their isolated underground stables at night
each exile has two different plants on either shoulder with which they share a special bond
president barbicane the president of the gun club and captain nicholl an engineer are both found dead at the start of the game not having survived the flight to the moon
a woman called diana features in the game 's backstory as a woman whose ancestors made contact with the selenites
apart from these human characters there are also several selenite characters such as the supreme moon ruler the high dignitary scurvy scruple and the three exiles
the first part of the game consists of ardan investigating the shell trying to regain his memory of what happened and how barbicane and nicholl died he will also encounter other problems most notably when his oxygen supply is low and needs to be remedied
eventually ardan 's journey will carry him into orbit around the moon in which he must prepare himself for a lunar landing
once ardan successfully lands the shell on the moon he must solve a series of puzzles on the surface in order to gain access to the hidden civilization below
there he encounters the selenite race
following this ardan focusses on finding a way to leave the moon and report his findings to earth
after acquiring what he needs ardan travels back to earth in the shell
he lands in the ocean and manages to swim to a nearby island where he meets another famous jules verne character captain nemo
the adventure company collaborated with developers kheops studios for the release
benoît hozjan the co @-@ founder of kheops studio became managing director of the game while alexis lang became the lead game designer
journey to the center of the moon was later renamed voyage inspired by jules verne
benoît hozjan explained the change saying that journey to the center of the moon seems to be confusing and some people thought that it could be the sequel to journey to the center of the earth another verne @-@ inspired pc game so marketing decided to change it
the name was changed on july <num> <year> a few months after the game 's announcement
benoît hozjan explained kheops studio 's choice of jules verne 's work as a basis for voyage saying that jules verne 's novels provide the two core elements of adventure games dreams and challenges
characters are ordinary men engaged in concrete challenges that are a great inspiration for puzzles
he further went on to say that the game is influenced by verne 's from the earth to the moon which documents the lead up to the lunar trip but draws more heavily from the sequel around the moon which recounts the actual voyage
the main difference hozjan said was that in the novel the protagonists fail to reach the moon whereas in voyage the trip is a success
additionally alexis lang attributed the inspiration for the selenites to h
g
wells the first men in the moon explaining that wells pictured a very ancient selenite civilisation horrified at human roughness
wells was more misanthropist than verne
to balance this fact we 've added a touch of irony in our story and chosen a very optimistic and joyful main character
the adventure company announced the release of the voyage demo on august <num> <year>
the demo included the game 's introduction in the shell
voyage originally slated for a september <num> release was shipped to stores ahead of schedule on august <num> <year>
the game retailed for us <num>
<num>
according to metacritic reviewers have given voyage scores between <num> and <num>
one of the more positively received aspects of the game was its ability to recreate the mood of <num> century science @-@ fiction with gamespot writing that the game nicely re @-@ creates the whimsical mood of <num> @-@ century sci @-@ fi and a sense of wonder fills every pixel of the graphic design
in contrast game over online magazine said that once the player leaves the capsule and arrives on the moon instead of viewing colorful and wondrous sights the game turns into a drab and unlikely bore
the puzzle aspect of voyage met with mixed responses
on the other hand gamespot accused the puzzle aspects of voyage of reduc ing jules verne 's tale of a visit to the moon in <year> to a series of clumsily arranged logic puzzles geared to try the patience of adventure @-@ game veterans
the puzzles in the game are often extremely difficult with just adventure attributing the unexpected difficulty in the game to the fact that there are often several different ways to achieve the same goals thanks to the game 's intelligence management system
the game 's inventory system received praise from gamersinfo as being very well done
in terms of graphics voyage was poorly received with the graphics being described by gamezone as containing some vibrant colors but lacking the lush spectacular view that has been seen in countless other adventure games
voyage has also been criticized for its lack of story and over @-@ reliance on back story
the game 's music was generally appreciated with jolt describing the music has having a nice retro @-@ futuristic feel which sets the mood perfectly
g4 commented on the game 's voice acting as overly dramatic but appropriate but criticized many of the sound effects as being cheesy
gamespot described ardan 's dialogue as somewhat lame and also criticized the game 's sound effects
metacritic averaged out the scores of several internet reviews of voyage to reach a rating of <num> the closest to an overall rating of the game

the road was known as the great road and ran between head of elk now elkton maryland and christiana bridge

this road was part of the washington – rochambeau revolutionary route that was used by the french army during their march from newport rhode island to yorktown during the revolutionary war passing through the area in september <year>

mega man bass was ported to the game boy advance gba handheld in <year> and was localized in north america and pal regions the following year
after defeating the evil dr
wily many times the robotic hero mega man is called into action once again when a powerful being known as king steals the blueprints to the creations of dr
wily and dr
light in order to create an army for robotic dominance over humans
having learned of the threat mega man 's rival bass decides to take matters into his own hands
the game is an action @-@ platformer where the player advances by defeating bosses and acquiring their signature weapons
mega man bass lets the player choose between either of its title characters each of which plays differently from the other
mega man bass debuted on the aging <num> @-@ bit super famicom despite the series having already transitioned to the playstation and sega saturn with mega man <num>
artist and designer keiji inafune claimed mega man bass was created with regard to younger players who did not yet own one of the more advanced gaming systems
the game received positive remarks from critics for its graphics and use of a tried @-@ and @-@ true gameplay formula though many found the difficulty to be too steep
although mega man bass shares many traits with previous console games in the series the ninth numbered title would not be released until <year>
it begins one year after megaman <num> when a robot villain named king breaks into dr
wily 's laboratory and then the robot museum to collect the data blueprints for the creations of dr
light
dr
light alerts the hero mega man that he must go at once to the robot museum to confront this new enemy
meanwhile bass mega man 's rival and wily 's greatest creation hears of the new criminal 's appearance and decides to prove himself the stronger robot by defeating king
proto man is the first to arrive at the scene
king divulges his plan to him he desires to create a utopia in which robots rule the world over humans
to accomplish this king seeks to create an unstoppable army using the data and invites proto man to join him
proto man refuses and attempts to attack but king counters and slices his body in half
proto man then teleports back to the lab for repairs while king escapes with the data instructing his minions to handle the heroes
with their own motivations mega man and bass set out to put a stop to king 's plans
after vanquishing eight powerful robots under allegiance to king cold man astro man ground man magic man tengu man dynamo man pirate man and burner man the duo infiltrates his castle and engages him in combat
proto man interrupts the fight and again attempts to defeat their new nemesis
putting all of his remaining energy into a blast proto man manages to destroy king 's shield and loses consciousness allowing mega man and bass to best king in battle afterwards
king questions why they fight so hard for humans when robots are the superior species
the pair explains that humans are the ones who created robots in the first place which confuses king
the villain reveals that his creator is dr
wily who then appears on a video monitor
when king asks the evil inventor why robots fight each other for the sake of humans wily strengthens his brainwashing level and restores his power
mega man and bass engage king in another battle and defeat him but not before the latter teleports proto man out of his castle
the castle begins a self @-@ destruct sequence and the protagonists escape without king
mega man and bass begin a final confrontation with dr
wily in his newly regained laboratory
when wily is beaten bass demands to know why he deceived him
wily explains that he created king simply to test bass abilities
wily shows him written plans for making a newer version of king to join with bass in this venture promising that the two would be invincible together
proto man appears and immediately destroys these plans
wily then demands bass to destroy proto man but bass is unsure
it was then proto man tells bass that although he is a strong robot of free will he can never defeat his rival because he has nothing for which to fight
bass doesn 't care and forces proto man to leave saying that he will still destroy mega man to prove his cause
mega man returns home where his sister roll presents him a letter from king who has somehow escaped the destruction of his castle
king wishes to atone for his own crimes against humans and hopes for them to be friends if they were to meet in the future
the player is tasked with completing a series of action @-@ platform stages while overcoming obstacles solving minor puzzles and battling enemies
destroying the robot master boss at the end of a stage lets the player acquire its special weapon
in previous games the player generally took on the role of the hero mega man
in this game the player can choose to start the game as either mega man or bass
however whichever character is picked must be used for the rest of the game and cannot be changed
mega man is able to charge his shots to make them more powerful and has the ability to slide along the ground
bass is able to rapidly fire his arm cannon in eight directions though shots cannot be fired while moving or pass through walls unless a certain upgrade is obtained
bass is also able to double @-@ jump jump a second time in mid @-@ air and dash along the ground
performing both simultaneously lets him cross great distances by doing a dash @-@ jump
the stage structure is different from other games in the series
after the introduction level the player can only choose between three robot masters
defeating cold man unlocks burner man and pirate man defeating astro man unlocks dynamo man tengu man and pirate man and defeating ground man unlocks magic man and tengu man
clearing one of these unlocked stages opens the way to a security room where the player must destroy a series of crystals with obtained robot master weapons
bypassing all eight crystals opens the way to the fortress stages
in a similar fashion to previous installments in the series enemies often drop bolts after they are destroyed and these can be exchanged for various restorative items and upgrades
however unlike in mega man <num> the security cavern offers a way to obtain large amounts of bolts without having to repeatedly visit stages
some upgrades are unique to either character such as mega man 's ability to call on his dog rush to search for items or an adaptor for bass to combine with his wolf treble to temporarily fly
also distributed throughout the introduction and robot master levels are a collection of <num> data cds that contain information on many prominent characters in the series
most of the cds are hidden either behind obstacles that need to be destroyed with a special weapon or accessed with a character @-@ specific ability making it impossible to collect them all on a single playthrough
cds collected in each playthrough are permanently placed in a database and remain unlocked after beating the game
saved games are used in place of the series traditional password system
according to series producer keiji inafune mega man bass was intended for younger players who still owned a super famicom and did not have the means to experience mega man <num> on one of the newer systems
even though trying to bridge out a new title on the super famicom was a little backwards at the time we didn 't want to make a half @-@ hearted attempt at it inafune explained
the design team included several new employees as well as members of previous mega man games
inafune required them to make the game as hardcore as possible
designer hideki ishikawa recalled the development of mega man bass as one big party
the staff attempted to create an original game while avoiding the same old same old
pitfall that so many long video game series suffer and had a lot of fun doing it
graphically mega man bass uses many of the same two @-@ dimensional sprites and animations as mega man <num>
two of the eight robot master bosses in mega man bass tengu man and astro man are borrowed from mega man <num>
the other six were newly created for the game by three character designers hitoshi ariga credited as h
ariga yoshihiro iwamoto credited as y
iwamoto and koji izuki credited as k
iduki designed two characters each
the bosses were officially unveiled on a teaser page in the kodansha magazine comic bonbon
each boss was given distinct characteristics so that they could be easily identified by players in both their aesthetics and personalities
some of these characters had different names during their conceptual phase prior to the finalization of the game
blast man became burner man freezer man became cold man and coil man became dynamo man
iwamoto originally denoted ground man as drill man despite there already being a robot master by that name in mega man <num>
the musical score for mega man bass was composed by akari kaida credited as a
kaida naoshi mizuta credited as n
mizuta and kirikiri @-@ chan real name unknown
rather than create tracks together each composer was responsible for their own songs
kaida would later work with other composers in the mega man series on the soundtrack for mega man <num> released in <year>
mega man bass was originally available in japan through the nintendo power game service in lawson convenience stores
its popularity prompted capcom to later release the game in super famicom cartridge form
until its gba re @-@ release it was one of the few mega man titles not localized for english @-@ speaking countries
the company commemorated the <num> anniversary of the mega man franchise with the gba version of the game
most critics found the game to be a solid yet conventional action @-@ platformer that successfully adheres to the classic mega man formula
electronic gaming monthly summarized that mega man bass is one of the best action games on gba and a great if slightly derivative platformer with plenty of replay value due to the collectible cds
gamepro was pleased with the game 's fidelity to its predecessors when compared to the deviations made by the mega man battle network and mega man zero series on the same system
gamespy contrarily criticized its lack of innovation declaring anyone that hasn 't tried a mega man game yet would be better advised to spend <num> on a new copy of mega man <num> on the psone rather than paying <num> for an inferior retread of the same game
many reviews also noted the game 's high difficulty
both giancarlo varanini of gamespot and craig harris of ign found that the game 's bosses have very unpredictable attack patterns thus making the battles extremely challenging
harris additionally observed a heavy amount of trial @-@ and @-@ error for the levels themselves where the player must die several times before completing each one
he concluded
it 's really the way mega man games have always been
and to be honest with all of the annoying little deaths in the game there 's always that sensation after every failure that you 've learned the challenge and perseverance definitely prevails in this game
according to famitsu mega man bass for the gba sold <num> @,@ <num> copies in japan between its release date and the week of december <num> <year>
nintendo power listed mega man bass as the <num> best gba game of all time in its <num> anniversary issue in <year>
a related game exclusive to japan titled rockman forte mirai kara no chōsensha ロックマン フォルテ 未来からの挑戦者 lit
rockman forte challenger from the future was released for the wonderswan handheld in <year>
the plot consists of the titular duo 's struggle against an adversary named rockman shadow
as mega man bass was released directly after mega man <num> and it shares plot and gameplay characteristics with the rest of the numbered titles in the series many believed it to be the ninth main game in the series however the actual mega man <num> would not be released until <year>
inafune explained in an interview with the brazilian magazine nintendo world that the ninth installment follows the storyline of mega man <num> and that the worlds for mega man bass and mega man <num> are meant to coincide with one another as evidenced by a schematic of bass in the ending of the game
in <year> bass was made playable via downloadable content in mega man <num>
as in mega man bass he is able to dash fire in seven directions with his buster and fly by combining with treble
elements of the game appeared in the mega man comic series from archie comics before it went on hiatus

s
state of ohio
a spur route sr <num> has its western terminus at an abandoned railroad grade just west of washington street in the village of burkettsville
its eastern terminus is <num>
<num> miles <num>
<num> km to the east of its western terminus at its junction with sr <num>
sr <num> was established in the early <num>
it started out as a much longer highway but earlier segments would become a part of sr <num> in the late <num>
sr <num> begins in downtown burkettsville at a former railroad grade just west of washington street
known as main street within burkettsville the route runs due east through the village 's central business district prior to entering a residential area where it intersects a few side streets
after leaving the village of burkettsville sr <num> becomes the boundary between darke county 's allen township and mercer county 's granville township
after a short distance through farmland the highway comes to an end as it arrives at its junction with sr <num>
continuing east after the route terminates is darke – mercer county line road
the ohio department of transportation odot conducts surveys throughout its highway system to determine traffic volume
this is most commonly expressed as the average annual daily traffic aadt or the measure of traffic volume for any average day of the year
in <year> odot determined that an average of <num> vehicles per day traveled along the length of sr <num>
this state highway is not included as a part of the national highway system a system of highways identified as being most important for the economy mobility and defense of the nation
originally sr <num> included the entirety of the current route along with the stretch of sr <num> from sr <num> north to sr <num> in coldwater
in <year> sr <num> was extended further north along the present alignment of sr <num> to what was then designated as sr <num> now a part of sr <num> west of celina
two years later sr <num> was extended south from its former southern terminus in rockford to its present southern terminus in greenville
consequently the entirety of what was the north – south stretch of sr <num> prior to that time became a part of the new extension of sr <num>
in turn sr <num> became the short spur route that it is today
it is constitutionally important and partly governs the relationship between the house of commons and the house of lords which make up the houses of parliament
this act must be construed as one with the parliament act <year>
the two acts may be cited together as the parliament acts <year> and <year>
following the rejection of the <year> people 's budget the house of commons sought to establish its formal dominance over the house of lords who had broken convention in opposing the bill
the budget was eventually passed by the lords after the commons democratic mandate was confirmed by holding elections in january <year>
the following parliament act which looked to prevent a recurrence of the budget problems was also widely opposed in the lords and cross @-@ party discussion failed particularly because of the proposed act 's applicability to passing an irish home rule bill
after a second general election in december the act was passed with the support of the monarch george v who threatened to create sufficient liberal peers to overcome the then conservative majority
the act effectively removed the right of the lords to veto money bills completely and replaced a right of veto over other public bills with a maximum delay of two years
it also reduced the maximum term of a parliament from seven years to five
queen anne had created <num> tory peers to vote through the treaty of utrecht in <year>
the reform act <year> was passed when the house of lords dropped opposition — william iv had threatened to create <num> new peers by request of the prime minister earl grey — creating an informal convention that the lords would give way when the public was behind the house of commons
for example irish disestablishment which had been a major bone of contention between the two main parties since the <num> was — following intervention by the queen — passed by the lords in <year> after w
e
gladstone won the <year> election on the issue
however in practice this gave the lords a right to demand that such public support was present and to decide the timing of a general election
it was the prevailing wisdom that the house of lords could not amend money bills since only the house of commons had the right to decide upon the resources the monarch could call upon
this did not however despite the apparent contradiction prevent it from rejecting such bills outright
in <year> with the repeal of the paper duties all money bills were consolidated into a single budget
this denied the lords the ability to reject individual components and the prospect of voting down the entire budget was seemingly unpalatable
it was only in <year> that this became a possibility
until the act the lords had equal rights over legislation compared to the commons but did not utilise its right of veto over financial measures by convention
there had been an overwhelming conservative @-@ unionist majority in the lords since the liberal split in <year>
with the liberal party attempting to push through significant welfare reforms with considerable popular support this seemed certain to cause problems in the relationship between the houses
between <year> and <year> several important measures were being considerably watered down or rejected outright for example birrell introduced the education bill <year> which was intended to address nonconformist grievances arising from the education act <year> but which was amended by the lords to such an extent that it was effectively a different bill upon which the commons dropped the bill
this led to the <num> june <year> resolution in the house of commons declaring that the lords power should be curtailed put forward by liberal prime minister henry campbell @-@ bannerman
in <year> hoping to force an election the lords rejected the financial bill based on the government budget the people 's budget put forward by david lloyd george by <num> votes to <num>
this according to the commons was a breach of the constitution and a usurpation of the rights of the commons
the lords suggested that the commons justify its position as representing the will of the people it did this through the january <year> general election
the liberal government lost heavily but remained in majority with the help of a significant number of irish nationalist and labour mps
the irish nationalists saw the continued power of the lords as detrimental to securing irish home rule
following the election the lords relented on the budget since reintroduced by the government it passing the lords on <num> april a day after the commons
a series of meetings between the liberal government and conservative opposition members was agreed
twenty @-@ one such meetings were held between <num> june and <num> november
the discussions considered a wide range of proposals with initial agreement on finance bills and a joint sitting of the house of commons and lords as a means by which to enforce commons superiority in controversial areas the number of lords present would be limited such that a liberal majority of <num> or more in the house of commons could overrule the lords
however the issue of home rule for ireland was the main contention with conservatives looking to exempt such a law from the parliament act procedure by means of a general exception for constitutional or structural bills
the liberals supported an exception for bills relating to the monarchy and protestant succession but not home rule
discussions were declared failed on <num> november
the government threatened another dissolution if the parliament act were not passed and followed through on their threat when opposition in the lords did not diminish
the elections of december produced little change from january
the calling of a second dissolution of parliament now seems to have been contrary to the wishes of edward vii
edward had died in may <year> while the crisis was still in progress
his successor george v was asked if he would be prepared to create sufficient peers which he would only if the matter arose
this would have meant creating over <num> new liberal peers
the king did however demand that it would have to be rejected at least once by the lords before his intervention
two amendments made by the lords were rejected and opposition showed little sign of slipping
this led asquith to declare the king 's intention to overcome the majority in the house of lords by creating sufficient new peers
it was passed in the lords by <num> votes to <num> votes a majority of <num>
this reflected a large number of abstentions
the long title of the act was an act to make provision with respect to the powers of the house of lords in relation to those of the house of commons and to limit the duration of parliament
section <num> defined the short title as the parliament act <year>
the bill was also an attempt to place the relationship between the house of commons and house of lords on a new footing
as well as the direct issue of money bills it set new conventions about how the power the lords continued to hold would be used
it did not change the composition of the lords however
the lords would only be able to delay money bills for one month effectively ending their ability to do so
these were defined as any public bill which contained only provisions dealing with the imposition repeal remission alteration or regulation of taxation the imposition for the payment of debt or other financial purposes of charges on the consolidated fund or on money provided by parliament or the variation or repeal of any such charges supply the appropriation receipt custody issue or audit of accounts of public money and the raising or guarantee of any loan or the repayment thereof
it did not however cover any sort of local taxes or similar measures
some finance bills have not fallen within this criterion consolidated fund and appropriation bills have
the speaker of the house of commons would have to certify that a bill was a money bill endorsing it with a speaker 's certificate
the local government finance bill <year> which introduced the community charge poll tax was not certified as a money bill and was therefore considered by the lords
whilst finance bills are not considered money bills convention dictates that those parts of a finance bill dealing with taxation or expenditure which if in an act alone would constitute a money bill are not questioned
other public bills could no longer be vetoed instead they could be delayed for up to two years
this two @-@ year period meant that legislation introduced in the fourth or fifth years of a parliament could be delayed until after the next election which could prove an effective measure to prevent it being passed
specifically two years had to elapse between the second reading in the house of commons in the first session and the passing of the bill in the house of commons in the third session
the speaker has to also certify that the conditions of the bill had been complied with
significant restrictions on amendments are made to ensure that it is the same bill that has been rejected twice
the <year> act made clear that the life of a parliament could not be extended without the consent of the lords
parliament had been limited to a maximum of seven years under the septennial act <year> but this was reduced by the passing of the parliament act <year>
parliament would now be limited to five years beginning the first meeting of parliament after the election
in practice no election has been forced by such a limitation as all parliaments have been dissolved by the monarch on request of the prime minister
it should be noted however that the five @-@ year maximum duration referred to the lifetime of the parliament and not to the interval between general elections
for example the <year> general election was held five years and one day after the <year> general election whilst the <year> general election was held on <num> april <year> and the next general election was not held until <num> may <year>
the reduction in parliament length was seen as a counterbalance to the new powers granted to the commons
these included the china indemnity bill <year> and the inshore fishing industry bill <year>
the use of the lords now temporary veto remains a powerful check on legislation
it was used in relation to the government of ireland act <year> which had been under the threat of a lords veto now removed
ulster protestants had been firmly against the passing of the bill
however it never came into force because of the outbreak of the first world war
amendments to the parliament act <year> were made to prolong the life of the <year> parliament following the outbreak of the first world war and <year> parliament because of the second world war
these made special exemptions to the requirement to hold an election every five years
legislation passed through the parliament act without the consent of the lords is still considered primary legislation
the importance of this was highlighted jackson v attorney general where the legality of the parliament act <year> was questioned
the challenge asserted foremost that the <year> act was delegated rather than primary legislation and that the <year> act had delegated power to the commons
if this were the case then the commons could not empower itself through the <year> act without direct permission from the lords
since it was passed under the <year> act it had never received the required consent of the lords
however the <year> act was found to be legal
the <year> act it was concluded was not primarily about empowering the commons but rather to restrict the ability of the lords to affect legislation
this ruling also means that efforts to abolish the house of lords a major constitutional change using the act could be successful although the issue was not directly addressed in the ruling
this was a pragmatic response which avoided the further problems of codifying unwritten rules and reconstructing the entire government
it is commonly considered a statute of constitutional importance which gives it informal priority in parliament and in the courts with regards to whether later legislation can change it and the process by which this may happen
it is also mentioned in discussion of constitutional convention
whilst it replaced conventions regarding the role of the house of lords it also relies on several others
section <num> <num> only makes sense if money bills do not arise in the house of lords and the provisions in section <num> <num> only if proceedings on a public bill are completed in a single session otherwise they must fail and be put through procedure again
it was opened in <year> in ludlow shropshire and won its first michelin star within a year and a second in the <year> guide
in july <year> bosi and his wife claire announced that they were to sell the location in ludlow and move closer to london
the property was sold to alan murchison and bosi purchased a new site on maddox street in london
bosi uses molecular gastronomy to create some items on the menu in an effort to enhance their flavours such as freeze @-@ drying cabbage to create a purée
the restaurant has received mixed reviews from critics but has been listed in the world 's <num> best restaurants since <year> and was named by egon ronay as the best restaurant in the uk in <year>
the good food guide ranked hibiscus as the eighth @-@ best restaurant in the uk in the <year> edition
it has also been awarded five aa rosettes
in <year> bosi started a new venture the fox grapes in wimbledon
this new gastropub operates under the same philosophy as hibiscus and is a collaboration with brother cedric and former sous chef at hibiscus patrick leano
the location had a <num> @-@ seat capacity and was previously occupied by a three aa rosette restaurant called the oaks
bosi had previously been head chef and won a michelin star at the overton grange restaurant just outside the town
he had intended to open a restaurant in warwickshire but found the premises too expensive and purchased a <num> @-@ year lease on the former oaks property in ludlow for £ <num> @,@ <num>
within a year hibiscus won its first michelin star and at the same time overton grange was downgraded before going in to receivership
working under bosi at hibiscus was sous chef glynn purnell who left hibiscus in <year> to become head chef at jessica 's restaurant in edgbaston
hibiscus gained a second star in the <year> michelin guide
in july <year> bosi and his wife claire announced that they were intending to sell hibiscus and open a new restaurant closer to london or in the capital itself
hibiscus closed in ludlow in april <year> with bosi selling the site to fellow chef alan murchison for £ <num> @,@ <num> but retaining the hibiscus name for himself
the restaurant was renamed le becasse sic and underwent a £ <num> @,@ <num> makeover before being re @-@ opened under head chef will holland
in <year> murchison 's company went into voluntary liquidation after running up debts of almost half a million pounds
bosi completed the deal in june <year> for a new site at <num> maddox street in london
he intended for the new hibiscus to be open by september and to transfer over the style of cooking he had used in ludlow saying i 'm transferring hibiscus not starting a new restaurant
the idea is to continue and build on what i have been doing
purchasing and fitting out the london premises cost around £ <num> million
many of the staff from the ludlow incarnation of hibiscus agreed to move to london to continue working at the restaurant including head chef marcus mcguinness and sommelier simon freeman
hibiscus re @-@ opened in october <year> in its new location after following building works and planning delays
the interior of the london @-@ based restaurant was decorated in orange and shades of brown
the walls were covered in pale @-@ coloured wooden panels and a chandelier designed as a series of globes hungs from the middle of the main dining room 's ceiling
the handover on the first day was so tight that builders moved out at midday and the first service was run at <num> pm that evening
the late opening resulted in the reviewers for the michelin guide having only a two @-@ week window in which to re @-@ assess the restaurant for the <year> guide
bosi admitted later that the restaurant was not yet up to scratch in those two weeks and agreed with the decision of michelin to downgrade hibiscus to a single star in the <year> guide
the restaurant was also given a rising star as one with potential to go up to two stars in the future
during the run up to christmas the stress of serving <num> covers a week in a new location with a modified menu resulted in three sous chefs resigning
the two @-@ star award was restored a year later in the <year> michelin guide as had been predicted by a number of bosi 's fellow chefs including tom aikens antonin bonnet and richard corrigan
sat bains went a step further and said i would love to see claude bosi regain his second star at hibiscus and win his third in time
he ’ s probably the best chef i know
he has been described as an innovator and his work has been compared to that of heston blumenthal at the fat duck
one of the new dishes bosi introduced following his move to london was a two @-@ part pork dish
the first part was roasted suckling pig served with sea urchin kohlrabi and a fondant of sweet potato
the second inspired by his daughter featured a sausage roll with a salad and a truffle dressing
other dishes have included roast chicken with an onion fondue and licorice and desserts include a chocolate tart served with basil ice cream
bosi uses molecular gastronomy techniques such as in the process for making a savoy cabbage purée in which the cabbage is freeze dried into a powder and then reconstituted but he prefers only to enhance the flavours of individual ingredients rather than changing those flavours by using unusual techniques
while stating that elements of the meal were very clever indeed such as foie gras ice cream and a sausage roll he described as a colossus he described the desserts as a disappointment calling an olive oil parfait a gloopy mess
overall he planned on returning to give bosi another chance
zoe williams also reviewed the restaurant shortly after it arrived in london for the daily telegraph
she enjoyed her visit and was impressed with the unusual combinations of foods that worked together saying the sheer expertise of taking a food with a range of flavours and knowing it 's in peak condition to meet four others
it really is something
john walsh also visited it for the independent after the restaurant arrived in london and gave the food four stars and the ambience and service three stars terry durack reviewed it for the same paper giving the restaurant <num> out of <num>
food critics from time out visited the restaurant in <year> and were disappointed compared to their previous visit
they thought that bosi 's food combinations just did not work but still said that some of his desserts were faultless
andy hayler gave the restaurant a score of six out of ten on his scale during his november <year> visit
the redeeming feature of his trip was a dish of venison he thought served with a confit of pear in mulled wine and savoy cabbage with a red wine and smoked chocolate sauce but he otherwise felt that the food was over @-@ worked and the service peculiarly amateurish

turner 's supposedly one @-@ dimensional nature however has occasionally allowed him to make unexpected plays with his feet
the most noteworthy of these were the momentum @-@ changing <num> @-@ yard option run against nc state in <year> and the fourth @-@ down nine @-@ yard scramble into field goal range against north carolina in <year>
pundits and coaches sometimes characterized turner as a quarterback who did not excel during practices but executed well on game @-@ day
maryland head coach ralph friedgen said he 's pretty go @-@ with @-@ the @-@ flow
and that 's his greatest strength and maybe his greatest weakness
the bottom line is he plays well in games
the baltimore sun wrote that he seems to play his best when it counts — and his worst when it doesn 't
regarding the <year> summer practices offensive coordinator james franklin said turner ranked in the middle compared with jordan steffy and josh portis in terms of completion percentage fewest interceptions and explosive plays that gained <num> yards or more
turner conceded that steffy was a better game @-@ planner during practices
head coach ralph friedgen who had offered critical or subdued assessments of turners practice said his intensity grew after losing the starting position to steffy prior to the <year> season
turner said it lit a fire in me in the sense that i had to be ready
among his maryland teammates and coaches turner earned a reputation as an archetypal laid @-@ back californian and for remaining calm under pressure
after the <year> win over rutgers offensive tackle scott burley described his roommate turner as real calm in the huddle
he would say guys are you ready to score again are you ready to run the ball on these guys and we 're like yeah let 's do that
turner received the nicknames sunshine and napoleon dynamite in reference to his similar appearance to the fictional characters in the films remember the titans and napoleon dynamite respectively
his strong interest in politics factored into his decision on where to attend college
he chose the university of maryland partly based on its close proximity to washington d
c
turner 's political views are liberal he is registered as a democrat and has described himself as an idealist
during the <year> season political discussions were common in the maryland locker room because of the presidential election
turner and fellow quarterback jordan steffy a conservative and supporter of presidential candidate senator john mccain were the most frequent debaters while defensive tackle dean muhtadi was described as the primary instigator
during the summer of <year> turner held an internship on capitol hill working for democratic representative steny hoyer the house majority leader and maryland 's fifth district congressman
turner had previously considered volunteering for the presidential campaign of barack obama which he said probably annoyed his conservative father john turner
describing his experience during the internship turner said it 's funny to compare how serious politics is and how serious football is
depending on who you talk to they 're both pretty big deals
there 's more to life than football
incidentally turner 's favorite sport is soccer not football
he is also interested in foreign cultures and expressed regret at being unable to spend a semester abroad because of college football
turner said that dependent upon the outcome of his football career he would like to attend the <year> world cup in south africa
he also got to meet his childhood idol david beckham while at the <year> south africa world cup
the roud folk song index classifies this tune and its variations as number <num>
the rhyme dates back at least to the <num> century and exists with different numbers of verses each with a number of variations
several theories have been advanced to explain its origins and to suggest meanings for the lyrics
jack fell down and broke his crown and jill came tumbling after
many verses have been added to the rhyme including a version with a total of <num> stanzas in a chapbook of the <num> century
the second verse probably added as part of these extensions has become a standard part of the nursery rhyme
early versions took the form up jack got and home did trot as fast as he could caper to old dame dob who patched his nob with vinegar and brown paper
by the early <num> century this had been modified in some collections such as l
e
walter 's mother goose 's nursery rhymes london <year> to up jack got and home did trot as fast as he could caper and went to bed and bound his head with vinegar and brown paper
a third verse sometimes added to the rhyme was first recorded in a <num> @-@ century chapbook and took the form then jill came in and she did grin to see jack 's paper plaster her mother whipt her across her knee for laughing at jack 's disaster
twentieth @-@ century versions of this verse include when jill came in how she did grin to see jack 's paper plaster mother vexed did whip her next for causing jack 's disaster
the rhyme is made up of quatrains with a rhyming scheme of abcb with occasional internal rhymes using falling rhymes where the rhyming sound is on a relatively unstressed syllable de @-@ emphasising the rhyme and a trochaic rhythm with the stress falling on the first of a pair of syllables known as a ballad form which is common in nursery rhymes
the melody commonly associated with the rhyme was first recorded by the composer and nursery rhyme collector james william elliott in his national nursery rhymes and nursery songs <year>
the roud folk song index which catalogues folk songs and their variations by number classifies the song as <num>
vinegar and brown paper were a home cure used as a method to draw out bruises on the body
the phrase jack and jill indicating a boy and a girl was in use in england as early as the <num> century
a comedy was performed at the elizabethan court in <year> @-@ <num> with the title jack and jill and the phrase was used twice by shakespeare in a midsummer night 's dream which contains the line jack shall have jill nought shall go ill iii ii <num> @-@ <num> and in love 's labour 's lost which has the lines our wooing doth not end like an old play jack hath not jill v ii <num> – <num> suggesting that it was a phrase that indicated a romantically attached couple as in the proverb a good jack makes a good jill
jack is the most common name used in english language nursery rhymes and by the <num> century represented an archetypal everyman hero while by the end of the middle ages jill or gill had come to mean a young girl or a sweetheart
however the woodcut that accompanied the first recorded version of the rhyme showed two boys not a boy and a girl and used the spelling gill not jill
this earliest printed version comes from a reprint of john newbery 's mother goose 's melody thought to have been first published in london around <year>
the rhyming of water with after was taken by iona and peter opie to suggest that the first verse may date from the first half of the <num> century
as is common with nursery rhyme exegesis complicated metaphors are often said to exist within the lyrics of jack and jill
most explanations post @-@ date the first publication of the rhyme and have no corroborating evidence
these include the suggestion by s
baring @-@ gould in the <num> century that the events were a version of the story told in the <num> @-@ century prose edda gylfaginning written by icelandic historian snorri sturluson who stated that in norse mythology hjúki and bil brother and sister respectively were taken up from the earth by the moon personified as the god máni as they were fetching water from the well called byrgir bearing on their shoulders the cask called saegr and the pole called simul
around <year> john bellenden ker suggested that jack and jill were two priests and this was enlarged by katherine elwes in <year> to indicate that jack represented cardinal wolsey c
<year> – <year> and jill was bishop tarbes who negotiated the marriage of mary tudor to the french king in <year>
it has also been suggested that the rhyme records the attempt by king charles i to reform the taxes on liquid measures
he was blocked by parliament so subsequently ordered that the volume of a jack <num> <num> pint be reduced but the tax remained the same
this meant that he still received more tax despite parliament 's veto
hence jack fell down and broke his crown many pint glasses in the uk still have a line marking the <num> <num> pint level with a crown above it and jill came tumbling after
the reference to jill actually a gill or <num> <num> pint is said to reflect that the gill dropped in volume as a consequence
the suggestion has also been made that jack and jill represent louis xvi of france who was deposed and beheaded in <year> lost his crown and his queen marie antoinette who came tumbling after a theory made difficult by the fact that the earliest printing of the rhyme pre @-@ dates those events
there is also a local belief that the rhyme records events in the village of kilmersdon in somerset in <year>

in <year> he made his debut as a lead actor in a feature film in peter cattaneo 's lucky break
he played jimmy hands an incompetent bank robber who masterminds an escape from a prison by staging a musical as a distraction
on preparing for the role nesbitt said short of robbing a bank there wasn 't much research i could have done but we did spend a day in wandsworth prison and that showed the nightmare monotony of prisoners lives
i didn 't interview any of the inmates because i thought it would be a little patronising as it was research for a comedy and also because we were going home every night in our fancy cars to sleep in our fancy hotels
the film was a commercial failure despite receiving good feedback from test audiences in the united states
nesbitt was only seven years old when the shootings happened and was ignorant of its cause he believed that there was no smoke without fire and that the catholic marchers must have done something to provoke the british army
he was filming cold feet in manchester when he received the script
he read it and found that had an extraordinary effect on him
nesbitt played ivan cooper in bloody sunday the man who pressed for the march to go ahead
to prepare for the role nesbitt met with cooper and spent many hours talking to him about his motives on that day
he met with relatives of the victims and watched the televised bloody sunday inquiry with them and also read don mullan 's eyewitness bloody sunday and peter pringle and philip jacobson 's those are real bullets aren 't they
greengrass compared nesbitt 's preparation to an athlete preparing for a race and told the observer for an irish actor doing the troubles is like doing lear
nesbitt had questioned whether he was a good enough actor to effectively portray cooper and was worried what derry catholics would think of a protestant playing the lead although ivan cooper himself is a protestant
shortly before bloody sunday was broadcast nesbitt described it as difficult but extraordinary and emotionally draining
the broadcast on itv in january <year> and its promotion did not pass without incident he was criticised by unionists for saying that protestants in northern ireland felt a collective guilt over the killings
his parents home was also vandalised and he received death threats
during the awards season nesbitt won the british independent film award for best performance by an actor in a british independent film and was nominated for the british academy television award for best actor
the film was also screened at film festivals such as the stockholm international film festival where nesbitt was presented with the best actor award
in an analysis of the film in the history memory journal aileen blaney wrote that it is nesbitt 's real @-@ life household name status that made his portrayal of cooper such a success
she reasoned that nesbitt 's celebrity status mirrors that of cooper 's in the <num> a household name across great britain northern ireland and the irish republic sic nesbitt 's widespread popular appeal is emphatically not contingent upon his protestant ulster identity and consequently the double @-@ voicing of the character he plays does not alienate viewers of an alternative or no sectarian persuasion
guardian journalist susie steiner suggested that his appearance in bloody sunday was an attempt to resolve the expression of his irishness on screen where he has taken part in a sectarian theme his intelligence as an actor has often been masked by an excessive cartoon @-@ style comedy
yet in his more successful high @-@ profile roles notably in cold feet and as pig finn in the gently pastoral film waking ned nesbitt 's irishness has been exploited for its romantic charm
it has been sugared and in the process de @-@ politicised
a critic identified bloody sunday as nesbitt 's coming of age film and nesbitt called it a turning point in his career
he refers to his career since the film was released as post @-@ bloody sunday
the series was conceived when nesbitt was working on playing the field he and producer greg brenman approached author colin bateman about creating a television series for nesbitt in a similar vein to bateman 's dan starkey novels
bateman and nesbitt were already well acquainted nesbitt had been considered for a main role in divorcing jack david caffrey <year> based on bateman 's original novel
a <num> @-@ minute pilot of murphy 's law was commissioned by the bbc initially as a comedy action adventure
bateman created a complex backstory for murphy which was cut at the request of the producers
after the broadcast of the pilot guardian critic gareth mclean wrote the likeable james nesbitt turned in a strong extremely watchable central performance though rarely did he look taxed by his efforts and his chemistry with claudia harrison was promising and occasionally electric
in <year> nesbitt won the irish film television award ifta for best actor in a tv drama for the role
the second series was broadcast in <year>
by <year> nesbitt had become tired of the formula and threatened to quit unless the structure of the series was changed
he was made a creative consultant and suggested that murphy keep one undercover role for a full series instead of changing into a new guise every episode
this new dramatic element to the series was intended to make it a closer representation of real @-@ life undercover work
alongside his research with former undercover officer peter bleksley nesbitt hired a personal trainer and grew a handlebar moustache to change murphy 's physical characteristics and tone down the cheeky chappie persona that the audience had become accustomed to from his roles
with his trainer he worked out three times a week boxing and doing circuits and weights
after the first new episode was broadcast sarah vine wrote in the times in the past when attempting a nasty stare or a hard face nesbitt has never managed much more than a faintly quizzical look hilarity forever threatening to break out behind those twinkly irish eyes
but here it 's different
he genuinely has the air of a man who means business
the refreshed series marked another milestone in nesbitt 's career he describes it as a big moment in his life
murphy 's law was not recommissioned for a sixth series which nesbitt attributed to the damage done to the fifth series ratings when it was scheduled opposite the popular itv drama doc martin
in <year> nesbitt appeared in wall of silence a fact @-@ based drama about the aftermath of the murder of schoolboy jamie robe
nesbitt played stuart robe the boy 's father who tries to break down the wall of silence in the local community to discover exactly what happened to his son
he had only just completed bloody sunday when he was offered the part and was unsure whether he wanted to take on such a demanding role so soon after playing ivan cooper
he decided to accept the part because he found it interesting
to prepare for the role nesbitt met with robe and spent weeks talking to him in his south london flat learning about jamie and of robe 's fight for his justice
nesbitt spoke with his natural accent instead of affecting robe 's south london speech as he did not want the audience to be distracted from the drama
the single @-@ drama was filmed over four weeks and broadcast in january <year>
the role gained nesbitt an ifta nomination for best actor in a tv drama later that year
in march <year> he appeared in tony marchant 's passer by playing joe keyes a man who witnesses a woman being accosted by some men on a train and chooses not to help
keyes later discovers that the woman was raped but cannot bring himself to admit in court that he did nothing to help her
nesbitt described keyes as like a better man than me a good father and husband
but once he has made a wrong decision he can 't control everything in his life as he thinks he is weak
he loses the respect of his wife his son and at work and has to reach the lowest possible point before finding redemption
as a result of these serious roles he was named the sixth most powerful figure in tv drama in a listing compiled by industry experts for the radio times
in september <year> he starred as jack parlabane in the itv adaptation of christopher brookmyre 's quite ugly one morning
the producers originally wanted scottish actor douglas henshall to play glaswegian parlabane but itv executives overruled them and cast nesbitt
he was given coaching to perfect the accent but it was soon discarded on the advice of both the director and his co @-@ star daniela nardini
also in <year> he filmed the roles of ronnie cunningham in millions danny boyle <year> and detective banner in match point woody allen <year>
he was considering taking time off from acting and did not really want the role in match point
he sent in an audition tape and was accepted for the part

people do not really get it and you will leave them with a foul taste in their mouth

armee
lasting from <num> – <num> december <year> the campaign occurred primarily in the vicinity of the moro river in eastern italy
the campaign was designed as part of an offensive launched by general sir harold alexander 's allied <num> army group with the intention of breaching the german army 's winter line defensive system and advancing to pescara — and eventually rome
beginning on <num> december four infantry divisions — one british one canadian one indian and one new zealand which included an armoured brigade — and two armoured brigades one british and one canadian of v corps and xiii corps attacked heavily defended german positions along the moro river achieving several exploitable bridgeheads by <num> december
throughout the next week nearly continuous combat operations by both sides — designed to keep one another pinned down — created stagnated defensive positions near orsogna and a narrow pit known as the gully
after being held at the gully for <num> days the canadians succeeded in outflanking german defences and forcing a german withdrawal to the ortona – orsogna line
on <num> december the line was attacked by both corps
by <num> december strong german defences had stalled canadian forces in ortona and british and new zealand forces in orsogna
although both ortona and villa grande were captured by the end of december general exhaustion among the allied forces prevented the capture of orsogna and an advance to pescara
when harsh winter weather set in it became clear to the allied generals that no further progress would be made and alexander called off the offensive
east of the apennine mountain spine was the british eighth army under general bernard montgomery
in october eighth army had crossed the bifurno river and pushed the german defenders from the volturno @-@ viktor line defences
delayed by logistical problems they were not able to attack the next line of defences the barbara line behind the trigno river until <num> november
however by <num> november forward elements of the eighth army were in contact with the forward defences of the german winter line which had been set on the high ground north of the sangro river
the main attack across the sangro by v corps lieutenant @-@ general charles allfrey comprising the british <num> infantry division major @-@ general vyvyan evelegh and <num> indian infantry division major @-@ general dudley russell with supporting and diversionary attacks further inland by <num> new zealand division lieutenant @-@ general bernard freyberg and xiii corps lieutenant @-@ general miles c
dempsey — was delayed by bad weather until late november
after several days of hard fighting the germans withdrew to the defences they had prepared on the high ground to the north of the moro river
the german defences on the moro were a centerpiece of the winter line which guarded the eastern side of the apennines along route <num>
montgomery hoped to punch through the winter line capture ortona and pescara and advance to rome
the <num> infantry division which had been spearheading v corps since the volturno line actions and had sustained over <num> @,@ <num> casualties in less than six months was relieved by the fresh 1st canadian infantry division major @-@ general chris vokes ready to renew the offensive on <num> december <year>
the <num> infantry division was sent into the mountains on the relatively quiet left wing of the army joining the british <num> infantry division major @-@ general gerard bucknall under xiii corps
montgomery 's plan was for the canadian division to attack across the moro in the coastal lowlands to take ortona first and then pescara
inland in the jagged hills above the headwaters of the moro the relatively fresh <num> new zealand division would attack toward orsogna while between these two the <num> indian infantry division would hold the centre of the front in a relatively static role
facing v corps was the 1st parachute division <num>
fallschirmjägerdivision under brigadier general generalmajor richard heidrich on the coast to their right stood the <num> panzergrenadier division <num>
panzergrenadierdivision under major general carl @-@ hans lungershausen succeeded by colonel oberst ernst @-@ günther baade on <num> december and further inland of them was the <num> panzer division <num>
panzerdivision under brigadier general smilo freiherr von lüttwitz with their right flank on orsogna
further inland facing xiii corps was the <num> infantry division <num>
infantriedivision under brigadier general hellmuth pfeifer supported by elements of 1st parachute and <num> mountain division <num>
gebirgsdivision under brigadier general julius ringel
together these units formed traugott herr ′ s lxxvi panzer corps the part of joachim lemelsen 's <num> army responsible for the front line to the east of the apennines
three primary points of attack were chosen villa rogatti along the western edge of the canadian sector san leonardo <num> km <num>
<num> mi south of ortona and san donato a small town near the italian coast
five primary infantry battalions were selected to assault these positions with the objective of crossing the moro river
the offensives were scheduled to start on the morning of <num> december
having conducted reconnaissance on their objective during the night of <num> december <year> an attack plan was devised by the battalion 's commander — lieutenant @-@ colonel cameron bethel ware — detailing the objectives of all four rifle companies
once the objectives had been secured by the early morning of <num> december anglo @-@ canadian reinforcements were to be moved into villa rogatti with the intention of repulsing the expected potentially strong german counterattacks
elements of three german regiments — the <num> and 361st panzergrenadier and <num> panzer — maintained strong defences within the town
at <num> <num> on <num> december two companies of the ppcli crossed the moro river moving towards villa rogatti
within an hour vicious fighting had erupted throughout the town as the two companies of canadian infantry struggled to break the german defensive lines
as b company broke through the german defences a company attacked to the northeast continuing to engage <num> panzergrenadier regiment <num>
panzergrenadier regiment near villa rogatti
although two canadian infantry companies now occupied villa rogatti german panzergrenadier forces still maintained substantial defences on the outskirts of the town
however c company continued to advance steadily along the eastern side of the town encountering significant resistance from the 361st panzergrenadier regiment <num>
panzergrenadier @-@ regiment
after approximately an hour of fighting by c and d companies villa rogatti had been occupied by canadian forces shortly before dawn
by mid @-@ morning german counterattacks on ppcli positions in the town had begun involving tanks from the <num> company of the <num> panzer regiment <num>
panzer @-@ regiment field guns and substantial infantry forces
throughout the afternoon two infantry companies of the ppcli fought off several attacks by german forces eventually managing to push them back to the vineyards on the northern edge of the town
while the ppcli had taken <num> casualties german casualties were estimated at <num>
however three strong german formation surrounded the canadian positions at villa rogatti rendering further exploitation of the bridgehead unlikely
col
ware was advised to be ready to withdraw across the moro river should german forces counterattack
in order to allow the canadian division a greater concentration of force on the night of <num> <num> december the indian 21st infantry brigade from the indian <num> infantry division amalgamated the western flank of the 1st canadian division into their own lines
as a result of the withdrawal canadian efforts would focus on achieving a bridgehead at san leonardo
in the early morning of <num> december a company was withdrawn and two additional seaforth companies resumed the offensive
as ppcli secured and held their bridgehead over the moro river the seaforth highlanders were struggling to enter san leonardo
by <num> <num> a single objective had been taken with canadian units pinned down by well @-@ coordinated defensive fire from several companies of the 361st regiment
simultaneously small arms fire prevented c company from moving up the road from the moro to san leonardo while d company remained on the southern banks of the moro throughout the early morning
in the afternoon having failed to capture san leonardo the hastings and prince edward regiment sent two rifle companies to the aid of the seaforth highlanders as seaforth b company attacked positions west of san leonardo — inflicting <num> casualties on german forces in the area
however the attack on san leonardo by three seaforth companies stalled rapidly when the <num> panzer regiment 's armoured companies reinforced the sector
as a result forin was ordered to prepare for a withdrawal from the san leonardo bridgehead
however the single rifle company making the attack achieved little territorial gain and lieutenant @-@ colonel kennedy — commander of the hastings prince edward regiment — ordered a withdrawal at <num> <num>
throughout <num> december strong german coastal defences would prevent further advancement despite the incorporation of tanks and artillery into the assault
by nightfall the german defenders still possessed control of san donato with the hastings and prince edward regiment withdrawing to the southern bank of the moro river
while the <num> highlanders of canada and princess patricia 's canadian light infantry resumed the assault on san leonardo from the southwest side of the town the royal canadian regiment rcr would break out of the bridgehead created by the hastings and prince edward regiment then move southwest towards san leonardo to link up with the <num> and ppcli
the operation was scheduled to start on the afternoon of <num> december
the attack began with a massive artillery barrage which pounded german positions continuously for two hours
at <num> <num> the saskatoon light infantry support battalion joined in hitting german positions with bursts of machine gun fire
the moment the heavy bombardment lifted the <num> highlanders and the rcr both initiated their attacks
d company of the <num> highlanders was able to quickly cross the moro taking minimal casualties
however b company was subjected to heavy fire from german mortars and <num> mm <num>
<num> in artillery positions
eventually however both companies managed to establish strong positions on the western ridge overlooking san leonardo
during the night of <num> <num> december units of the royal canadian engineers rce constructed a bridge over the moro to allow armour and equipment to move into san leonardo the following day
as the <num> highlanders secured their positions west of san leonardo the royal canadian regiment was involved in intense fighting southwest of san donato
two companies had advanced against strong and well prepared german defences of the <num> panzergrenadier regiment
a company was quickly tied down by german mortar fire while b company flanked german positions to the north of san donato
by nightfall all four companies held tenuous positions in the thick of german defences
on the night of <num> <num> december the rcr was subjected to counterattacks by the <num> panzergrenadier regiment which were repulsed with the support of continuous canadian artillery shelling
by the morning of <num> december the rce had completed the bridge across the moro river enabling the tanks of the <num> armoured regiment the calgary regiment to transport two companies of seaforth highlanders across the river into san leonardo
by mid morning san leonardo had been cleared of german defenders although strong positions still existed outside of the town
within an hour the calgarys tanks had broken through german positions near sterlen castle and two companies had linked up with the <num> highlanders and princess patricia 's canadian light infantry within san leonardo finally establishing firm canadian positions across the moro river
near the end of <num> december german forces of the <num> panzergrenadier division fell back to their second defensive line a formidable obstacle known as the gully
the division had the british <num> independent parachute brigade under their command anchoring their left flank and were supported by heavy concentrations of artillery and air support
surprise was achieved as traugott herr the commander of lxxvi panzer corps had been persuaded that the new zealanders would not be in a position to launch a major attack until <num> december
initially the new zealand attack progressed well but the german defenders regained their composure and the attack lost momentum against heavily fortified defensive positions
by <num> <num> the nz <num> infantry battalion had fought its way in slow house to house fighting to the centre of the town but were pinned down with no prospect of further progress without significant armoured support
however a combination of concealed minefields and well dug in german armour made the task of the allied tanks impossible
in the early hours of <num> december the new zealand commander — bernard freyberg — ordered a withdrawal from the town with a view to renewing the attack after further softening up from artillery and bombers
with no river crossing available the indian engineers rushed to build a bridge across the moro which was completed on <num> december and allowed infantry and supporting armour to cross and expand the bridgehead on the far bank
the bridge was named the impossible bridge because the local geography required for it to be built backwards from the enemy bank of the river
<num> mi north of san leonardo
the line centred around a natural ravine known as the gully with an average depth of <num> ft <num> m
general vokes initial plan to take the position as well as achieve a foothold on the roads toward ortona consisted of a frontal assault by the <num> canadian infantry brigade which would seize vino ridge capture the gully and gain positions on the ortona to orsogna road
however german defences were adequately prepared including gun @-@ pits bunkers and shelters
on <num> december three canadian battalions made their first attempt to cross the gully
although they succeeded in capturing vino ridge directly south of the gully attempts to neutralise german positions in the ravine were unsuccessful
on <num> december the three battalions made another attempt with the loyal edmonton regiment suffering heavy casualties in their attempts to take german positions in the sector
although a badly mauled a company was able to gain a foothold on the reverse slope newly arrived german units forced the remaining men to withdraw
on <num> december <year> general vokes sent the three battalions of the <num> canadian infantry brigade against german defences in the gully
the assault started poorly when canadian artillery plans were captured by soldiers of the <num> panzergrenadier division 's <num> regiment
when the west nova scotia regiment attacked the gully they were subject to counterattacks by the <num> panzergrenadier regiment approximately <num> <num>
by <num> <num> the regiment had called off its attacks and had taken heavy casualties
to the west princess patricia 's canadian light infantry fared little better with c company taking heavy casualties in their assault
attempts were again made on <num> december by two battalions of the <num> canadian infantry brigade and the attacks were driven back by tenacious german resistance
on the evening of <num> december the heavily depleted <num> panzergrenadier division were relieved from their positions in the gully by units of the 1st parachute division
a small force from the royal 22e régiment would move to casa berardi a small set of farmhouses west of the gully before outflanking german positions with infantry and armour thereby forcing the 1st parachute division to withdraw
the attack was to begin at dawn with two companies of the royal 22e régiment attacking casa berardi with artillery support
by <num> <num> both companies had control of the lateral highway leading to casa berardi
c company — under captain paul triquet — pushed on toward casa berardi with support from the ontario regiment while d company found itself involved in firefights southwest of casa berardi
at <num> <num> c company began their assault toward the manor house in casa berardi some <num> @,@ <num> yd <num> @,@ <num> m away
strong german defences caused heavy casualties to the attackers only <num> men and five tanks made it to within <num> yd <num> m of the objective
despite the arrival of several panzer ivs triquet 's remaining forces captured the manor house at <num> <num>
however only <num> men of c company remained fit to continue fighting
for his efforts to capture casa berardi triquet was awarded the victoria cross
this would allow the indian division to narrow and concentrate their attack and give montgomery four divisions to continue the attack between orsogna and the sea
by <num> december the british <num> infantry brigade — the first of <num> division 's brigades — was in place and under the new zealand division 's command
once <num> division headquarters and its other brigades had arrived these two left hand divisions were to be organised under the command of xiii corps commanded by lieutenant @-@ general miles dempsey
to the left of the canadian division the indian 21st brigade had by <num> december established a solid bridgehead around the impossible bridge
that night a second <num> indian division brigade — the <num> indian infantry brigade — passed through and attacked towards caldari
the 1st battalion royal fusiliers stormed the village in a wild night 's fighting while the 1st battalion <num> gurkha rifles seized point <num> nearby holding it against determined counterattacks including from tanks in the afternoon of <num> december
that evening 1st battalion <num> frontier force regiment attacked on the left of the gurkhas and established positions on the lateral road between ortona and orsogna running parallel to the moro some <num> @,@ <num> yd <num> m north of the impossible bridge
on the evening of <num> december the 1st <num> battalion essex regiment from the indian division 's <num> indian infantry brigade which had been held in reserve was committed on the left flank of the frontier force regiment to advance in the direction of crecchio and overran a number of german positions
by the end of <num> december further attacks from the <num> punjab regiments <num> battalion had secured positions on the lateral road ensuring that the <num> indian division was firmly embedded in the main german defences
meanwhile at <num> <num> on <num> december the new zealand division — electing not to make a further frontal assault on orsogna — launched their <num> brigade in operation florence a new flanking attack to the right of the village
by that afternoon <num> brigade was well established on the orsogna to ortona lateral road and had driven a shallow salient into the german forward defensive line
although they had exhausted nearly all their reserves divisional headquarters was optimistic for the prospects for the next day given the heavy casualties they had inflicted that day
however the germans launched a counterattack at <num> <num> on <num> december throwing in men from the <num> parachute regiment sent by herr to the <num> panzer division to relieve the exhausted <num> panzergrenadier regiment
these troops had arrived late that evening after a long journey
supported by tanks they attacked the right @-@ hand new zealand positions held by the 21st nz battalion but were held off and had retired by daylight
meanwhile even before the german counterattack had been repelled the <num> regiment had attacked toward orsogna with two squadrons of sherman tanks
under intense artillery and anti @-@ tank fire the tanks and infantry became separated and the tanks became a target rather than a threat
operation florence had come to an end
while the german line had been pushed back and they had sustained casualties they could ill afford they still firmly held orsogna
furthermore the new zealand division was for the time being fought out and needed a period of consolidation and reorganisation
by <num> december the british <num> division had completed its move into the line between the new zealand and the indian divisions
there followed a period of hostile patrolling and skirmishing on the xiii corps front
the main burden of the fighting was therefore assumed by v corps as the canadians pushed for ortona with the indian division on their left flank attacking toward villa grande and tollo
vokes planned for an attack by the carleton and york regiment to be the last of the frontal assaults against the gully
should this attack fail the 1st brigade 's seaforth highlanders and the royal canadian regiment would move through casa berardi and outflank german defences forcing a withdrawal from the gully
at <num> <num> on <num> december two companies of the carleton and york regiment attacked
after little more than an hour of fighting however the canadians were forced to call the attack off
in the afternoon the two heavily depleted companies of the royal 22e régiment fought off a large german counterattack on casa berardi with the royal canadian horse artillery firing <num> @,@ <num> rounds in support of canadian forces
on <num> december vokes planned what would be the largest assault on the gully during the campaign
beginning at <num> <num> canadian artillery would bombard a <num> m <num> @,@ <num> ft front to a depth of <num> m <num> ft
every five minutes the barrage would move <num> m <num> yd forward continuing to pound german defences in the bombardment area
less than <num> m behind this barrage the <num> highlanders would advance across the ortona @-@ orsogna lateral road
at the same time the <num> indian division would attack northward toward crecchio preventing german reinforcements from reaching the gully
when the <num> highlanders reached the cider crossroads the royal canadian regiment would move north overrunning cider itself then advance up the ortona @-@ orsogna road
both battalions would be supported by tanks of the three rivers regiment
at first the attack went extremely well
however when the artillery shifted their barrage the german defences quickly recovered and their machine gun fire devastated the advancing forces
in c company of the royal canadian regiment every platoon commander was killed or wounded
the attack was quickly abandoned
on <num> december canadian forces tried again and the royal canadian regiment attacked cider crossroads at noon
this time vokes was determined that the operation would be successful with armoured forces of the three rivers regiment moving to the start lines well before <num> <num>
due to shortages of fuel and poor weather h @-@ hour was postponed until <num> <num>
when h @-@ hour came a powerful creeping barrage supported two companies of the royal canadian regiment eastward
by evening b company controlled the cider crossroads having met virtually no resistance in their advance to the objective
however german forces had already evacuated the gully falling back to prepare for a strong defence of ortona with elements of the powerful 1st parachute division firmly entrenched in the town
the attack went in at <num> <num> on <num> december but failed in desperate fighting
the <num> <num> battalion essex regiment renewed their attack the following morning with more success
after a counterattack by german paratroops had been repulsed at midday the essex advanced to mop up the remainder of the village
however deadly small scale house @-@ to @-@ house battles continued throughout the rest of <num> december and for the next two days as the determined parachute soldiers clung on
to the south of villa grande the <num> <num> punjabis had taken vezzano on <num> december and a continuous brigade line had been established
on <num> december reinforcements in the form of <num> battalion <num> punjab regiment were brought forward and after a softening up barrage were launched at the east side of villa grande
with four battalions now involved the <num> battalion royal west kents had by now been tasked on the south east side of the village supported by tanks villa grande was finally cleared by the end of <num> december
the troops of the <num> indian division entered the village to find a shambles
one correspondent described the scene as though a giant had trodden on a child 's box of blocks
in the afternoon the british <num> infantry division attacked on the right wing of the corps front toward the arielli stream
their objective was to secure the flank of the <num> new zealand division which was in turn to attack northwest and west from the salient in order to roll up the orsogna defences from the north
after the british <num> infantry division had achieved its objectives the <num> new zealand infantry brigade attacked at <num> <num> on <num> december
despite intensive artillery support <num> guns on a <num> @,@ <num> yards <num> @,@ <num> m front the tired and understrength new zealand battalions struggled to make progress
by the afternoon it had become clear to the new zealand commander — bernard freyberg — that the stubborn defences of the <num> panzer division would not be broached
he is reported to have remarked it is not a question of further advance it is a question of holding on to what we have got
the xiii corps front was effectively deadlocked and settled into a posture of active defence and patrolling
paratroop engineers and infantry had destroyed much of ortona itself turning the streets into a debris @-@ filled maze
major streets were mined with demolition charges throughout the main piazza and booby traps littered the town
german forces had also buried tanks in the rubble leaving only the turrets exposed
on <num> december <year> the under @-@ strength loyal edmonton regiment moved toward ortona with the seaforth highlanders covering their eastern flank
throughout the day they encountered heavy machine gun fire during their attempts to enter ortona
by nightfall both battalions held a toehold on the western edge of ortona yet had encountered heavy resistance in their attempts to secure it
the following day d company of the loyal edmonton regiment launched attacks eastward towards the city centre but accurate german sniper fire rapidly stalled the advance
throughout the remainder of the week the battle of ortona degenerated into a small @-@ scale version of the battle of stalingrad with vicious house @-@ to @-@ house fighting through the narrow streets and debris of ortona
over the course of the battle canadian forces developed innovative mouse @-@ holing tactics moving between houses to avoid german sniper fire in the open streets
german counterattacks on <num> and <num> december caused significant casualties to canadian forces in the town
in danger of being outflanked by allied advances west of ortona the 1st parachute regiment abandoned the town the following day leaving ortona to canadian forces
canadian casualties in the fighting for the town approached <num> killed or wounded
however on <num> december as v corps probed along the coastal plain towards pescara a blizzard enveloped the battlefield
drifting snow sleet and biting winds paralysed movement and communications on the ground while cloud ceiling and visibility fell to nil and grounded the airforce
montgomery — realising the eighth army no longer had the strength or conditions to force its way to pescara and the via valeria to rome — recommended to general alexander that the eighth army offensive should be halted
alexander agreed but ordered him to maintain aggressive patrolling in order to pin the units of the lxxvi panzer corps in the adriatic sector and prevent kesselring moving them to reinforce the xiv panzer corps front opposite mark clark 's u
s
fifth army where the allied offensive would continue
in spite of this three attempts during the winter of <year> <num> by fifth army to break through into the liri valley at cassino failed
as spring approached in <year> alexander concentrated his forces in great secrecy by thinning out the adriatic front and bringing the bulk of eighth army 's striking power to the cassino front
the combined attack of his two armies during the fourth and final battle of monte cassino in early may took kesselring by surprise and led to the allied capture of rome in early june

his business involved braiding dog hairs around fishhooks the result of which could be sold as trout flies
he began tying the fly @-@ fishing lures in his bedroom then he moved the business into his parents basement
in time he got space above a grocery store to continue the business full @-@ time
after graduating from high school he attended iowa state university from <year> to <year> where he met fellow isu student elinor healy from grand marais minnesota
berkley and elinor married in minneapolis on august <num> <year> and their son kenneth was born in <year> thomas in <year> and daughter joanne in <year>
berkley ’ s college and personal life was interrupted in <year> when he joined the army
he served in the united states army as first lieutenant and flight trainer from <year> to <year>
when he got back he began to garner success from his fish tackling business
his business became larger with hundreds of employees and international operations he had become a millionaire by the <num>
he served as member of the spirit lake board of education from <year> to <year>
in <year> he ran against wiley mayne a republican incumbent in iowa 's <num> congressional district
mayne was a staunch supporter of richard nixon and secured victory along with the president in a year favorable to the republicans
mayne however would politically suffer after watergate he was one of only a few republicans to vote against impeaching the president on the judiciary committee
the damage had already been done and bedell defeated mayne in a <year> rematch
during his time at congress bedell took efforts to uphold representative democracy
he held town halls regularly with his constituents and he would let them vote on motions to decide what he would do in congress on their behalf
this type of communication told bedell of the types of issues affecting his farming constituency
thus though bedell had not farmed in his life he would take steps in congress to benefit farmers
one initiative which came from his constituents problems with the barge industry focused on waterway usage fees
he introduced legislation in <year> that would require the barge industry to pay a fee for using the waterways which bedell pointed out the government paid millions of dollars to create and maintain
bedell 's original plan set the rate the barge industry paid as directly related to the amount the government spent on waterway projects
this would have the additional effect of helping curb unnecessary waterway projects and it was the same plan proposed by pete domenici in the senate
congress eventually passed a watered @-@ down version of the original plan put forward by bedell and senator pete domenici
the compromise version enacted a tax on the gasoline barges used and put it into a trust for waterway projects
while other supporters of waterway usage fees including domenici backed the compromise bedell gave a passioned plea for his colleagues to oppose it
he viewed it as lacking a crucial element of the original plan that of capital recovery
the trust was optional and the government could spend money on waterway projects irrespective of the trust
the compromise was eventually signed by jimmy carter
bedell 's original plan never made it through the house of representatives but he continued to introduce it in succeeding sessions
it would not however get a floor vote in succeeding sessions
this plan backed by labor unions and certain democrats passed the agriculture committee as an amendment to farm legislation
it mandated a referendum that would then be used to determine what types of production controls to enact
the purpose of this plan was twofold production controls would decrease the aggregate supply of crops thus making individual crops cost more which would benefit farmers who were in the middle of an acute debt crisis
second by styling it as a referendum the farmers would get to decide the severity of the controls
on the other hand opponents of the bedell plan had a very different view of this legislation
representatives such as pat roberts claimed that the referendum was redundant because the farmers already voted the politicians into office and this bill was an example of the politicians not doing their jobs
the reagan administration opposed the bill because of their opposition to production controls and the president threatened to veto the farm bill if bedell 's plan was left in place
when the bill got to the floor an amendment was proposed to strike this provision and it was passed <num> @-@ <num>
he also claimed that certain large oil companies underpaid their windfall taxes in certain cases and wanted to pass legislation to increase regulations on these corporations
in these investigations bedell quickly gained the support of small gasoline marketers and congressman bill nelson
the chief target arco was accused of not paying all of its taxes on alaskan crude oil
in the end the government tried to make a case against arco but it was eventually dropped in <year>
bedell used this opportunity to attack the administration for not caring about small business owners and he advocated that governmental agencies put aside <num> @-@ <num> of their research and development money for small businesses
then in <year> bedell visited nicaragua and honduras along with representative robert g
torricelli
during the trip bedell spoke with soldiers generals governmental officials and members of the contras
his conclusion at the end of the trip was that ronald reagan was aiding the contras in violation of federal law
he promised to hold hearings after returning to congress
bedell would later join other house democrats in demanding documents from the white house related to the contras but the reagan administration refused to provide them
bedell became angrier with the reagan administration as the decade wore on
he called his central american policies sheer lunacy saying that the mining of harbors was an acts of war
bedell would retire from congress before reagan 's acts in central america would culminate with the iran @-@ contra affair
furthermore bedell was a sharp critic of reagan 's agricultural policies calling for john block to resign after calling his agricultural plan a failure that was dead on arrival in both the house and the senate
reagan 's agricultural plan consisted primarily of a gradual reduction in farm subsidies
he also attacked the department of agriculture for looking backward when it dismissed the only expert on organic farming
also as chairman of the subcommittee on department operations research and foreign agriculture which was in charge of regulating usda operations he opposed the proposals reagan had for reforming the organization
the proposals generally involved shifting costs for meat inspections and other usda duties from the federal government to the industry
it asserted that bedell had gone to taiwan in <year> to discuss prior violations of customs law in regards to the sale of fishing rods from the company 's taiwan subsidiary
bedell responded by denying any wrongdoing saying that he has not been personally involved in the company in years
in the end no charges were levied against him and he was reelected after the story was published
since then he has founded a center for alternative medicine and is a noted advocate of health freedom
due largely to his friendship with tom harkin he remains an important political figure in iowa with politicians such as howard dean meeting him in their trips to the state
also the elinor bedell state park was established in <year> on land donated by berkley bedell
the park is named after the congressman 's wife
as an opponent of the vietnam war bedell signed a petition urging against united states military intervention in iraq
this petition was signed with the names of <num> former congressmen from the <num> and was presented in a press conference on march <num> <year>
bedell said that it was unbelievable for the united states to settle disputes with war and he said that an iraq war would be similar to the vietnam war
in the <year> presidential election bedell attacked john kerry for voting for newt gingrich 's freedom to farm act which bedell claims wrecked the farm program
bedell would later officially endorse howard dean 's candidacy
for the <year> election bedell met with chris dodd
however in december <year> he announced his endorsement of barack obama
australia bart vs
australia is the sixteenth episode of the sixth season of the simpsons
it originally aired on the fox network in the united states on february <num> <year>
in the episode bart is indicted for fraud in australia and the family travels to the country so bart can apologize
the australian parliament decides to give him the additional punishment of a boot to his buttocks but the simpson family refuses
bart later changes his mind and agrees to the punishment but just as he is about to receive it he moons the australians and the family flee back to america
the episode was written by bill oakley and josh weinstein and directed by wes archer
it features cultural references to films such as mad max <num> and crocodile dundee
bart vs
australia acquired a nielsen rating of <num>
<num> and was the fourth highest rated show on the fox network the week it aired
it received mixed reception in australia with some australian viewers saying the episode was a mockery of their country
lisa explains not entirely correctly that the water never drains the other way except in the southern hemisphere due to the coriolis effect but bart does not believe her
to confirm this bart makes phone calls to various countries in the southern hemisphere
lisa points out how expensive international calls are so bart decides to make a collect call instead
he calls australia where a little boy answers the phone
pretending to represent the international drainage commission bart is informed that the toilet and sink are both draining clockwise
frustrated bart asks him to go and check the toilets of the neighbors
the call takes six hours to complete since the boy lives in the outback and bart forgets to hang up the phone
later the boy 's father is billed a <num> referred to as dollarydoos
the father calls bart and demands that he pay but bart only taunts him
unfortunately for bart the father 's neighbour is a federal member of parliament who reports bart 's offense to the prime minister — who is relaxing naked in a nearby pond
after a long series of ignored letters australia indicts bart for fraud
the united states department of state wants to send him to prison in order to placate the australian government but marge furiously objects to this idea
the state department then settles on having bart publicly apologize in australia
the family is sent to australia and they stay in the american embassy which is fitted with all the comforts of their home country including a specially modified toilet that overcomes an exaggerated coriolis effect
then they start exploring the local culture
after bart makes his apology the parliament reveals that they want to give him the additional punishment of a booting which is a kick in the buttocks using a giant boot
bart and homer escape and the family flees to the american embassy
after a prolonged standoff the two governments propose a compromise to the simpson family one kick from the prime minister through the gate of the embassy with a regular shoe believed to be a wingtip
marge is opposed to the idea but bart agrees
however bart dodges the kick moons the australians with the words don 't tread on me written on his buttocks then hums the star @-@ spangled banner
in a scene reminiscent of the fall of saigon the simpson family flees the outraged country in a helicopter
looking down on australia they see that bullfrogs have begun to overpopulate and destroy the australian ecosystem due to a bullfrog bart left earlier at the airport
viewing the devastation the family remark upon the destruction that can be caused by introducing a foreign species into a new environment and laugh at the australians misfortune unaware that a koala is hanging onto the helicopter
the camera zooms in on the koala ending with a close @-@ up of its eye implying that america will face a similar fate as australia
the writing staff wanted to do an episode where the simpsons family traveled to australia because they thought everyone in australia had a good sense of humor and that they would get the jokes
the staff had previously poked fun at several american institutions on the show and they thought it would be interesting to poke fun at a whole nation
they designed australia and the australian people very inaccurately and many things were completely made up for fun
the animators however got two australian tourist guides to help them out with the design of the australian landscape and buildings as well as the american embassy
the writers did research on the coriolis effect for this episode
lisa 's explanation of the effect is incorrect it affects global weather patterns and is caused by the spinning of the globe on its axis
the amount of water in a toilet or sink is much too small to be affected by it
in <year> fox studios australia in sydney used a different version of bart vs
australia as part of their simpsons attraction called the simpsons down under
they had contacted the simpsons writing staff and asked if they would write the screenplay for a ride in their attraction based on this episode
the episode was re @-@ edited and re @-@ animated for the ride and new scenes were included
the attraction featured motion capture technology allowing audience members faces and expressions to be transformed into moving cartoon characters
this episode perpetuated a popular myth that the coriolis effect affects the motion of drains in the northern and southern hemispheres
in reality the coriolis effect affects global weather patterns
the amount of water in a toilet or sink is much too small to be affected by it
when bart is talking to the boy 's father on the phone he says i think i hear a dingo eating your baby referencing the case of azaria chamberlain a ten @-@ week @-@ old baby who was killed by dingoes
the bullfrogs taking over australia and destroying all the crops is a reference to the cane toad originally introduced to australia in order to protect sugar canes from the cane beetle but became a pest in the country
when the simpson family go to an australian pub bart plays with a pocketknife at the table and a man asks him you call that a knife and as the man draws a spoon from his pocket he says this is a knife
the scene is a reference to a famous scene from crocodile dundee in which mick dundee is threatened by some thugs with a switchblade and mick takes out a bowie knife and says that 's not a knife that 's a knife the simpson family is shown a slide show by the us department of state depicting a boarded up cinema with a sign out the front saying yahoo serious festival in reference to the australian actor and director yahoo serious
wez one of the characters from the <year> film mad max <num> the road warrior is seen in the australian mob that chases bart and homer to the american embassy
australia finished <num> in the ratings for the week of february <num> – <num> <year> with a nielsen rating of <num>
<num>
it was the fourth highest rated show on fox that week
the episode has since become study material for sociology courses at the university of california where it is used to examine issues of the production and reception of cultural objects in this case a satirical cartoon show and to figure out what it is trying to tell audiences about aspects primarily of american society and to a lesser extent about other societies
since airing the episode has received positive reviews from fans and television critics
in a dvd review of the sixth season ryan keefer said all the australian jabs you expect to have here are present
bart 's international incident is hilarious from top to bottom
the phone calls he makes to other countries particularly buenos aires are fantastic
this is one of the more under appreciated episodes in the series run
vanity fair named it the second best episode of the simpsons in <year>
bart vs
australia was also nominated for an emmy award in <year> in the category outstanding individual achievement in sound mixing for a comedy series or a special
shortly after it had aired the simpsons staff received over <num> letters from australians who were insulted by the episode
they also received letters from people complaining about the australian accents used in the episode that sounded more like south african accents
the simpsons writer and producer mike reiss claimed that this episode is australia 's least favorite and that whenever we have the simpsons visit another country that country gets furious including australia
he claimed that they were condemned in the australian parliament after the episode had aired
the newcastle herald 's james joyce said he was shocked when he first saw the episode who are the americans trying to kid here i agree australia has its faults as does any other country
but laughing in our face about it then mocking our heritage was definitely not called for
it embarrassed and degraded our country as well as making us look like total idiots
warren martyn and adrian wood the authors of the book i can 't believe it 's a bigger and better updated unofficial simpsons guide advised that the episode is best if watched with australians who will be perhaps understandably aggrieved at their portrayal
after the attack on the french this is a vicious unkind offensive and wonderfully amusing slaughter of australian culture by the makers of the simpsons
the simpsons executive producer david mirkin who produced the episode responded to the criticism in an interview with the newcastle herald by saying we like to have the simpsons the entire family travel and this was the beginning of that
australia was a fantastic choice because it has lots of quirky visual things
and it 's a country that is really very close to america very in sync with america
we are so similar but yet there are all these fantastic differences familiar yet twisted
it was intentional to make it very inaccurate
that was our evil side coming out we 'll take our knowledge of australia and we 'll twist it around to stimulate an audience and annoy them at the same time
despite being criticized for mocking the country the episode received positive reviews from australians too
jim schembri of the australian newspaper the age named it the funniest episode ever while the cryptonote was forked the knifey @-@ spooney fork into the dollarydoo cryptocurrency in honour of the episode

from the label yours faithfully was released on march <num> <year>
the album featured a remixed version of jackson 's successful centipede
initially the singer had not wanted to feature the track believing that it was part of the past

he was a canon of hereford cathedral before becoming archdeacon of shropshire by may <num>
foliot is a frequent witness on charters as archdeacon but little else is known of his tenure of the office
from <num> to <num> he served as a papal judge @-@ delegate three times
in <num> he was also king john 's candidate for the see of st david 's in wales but was not elected
after foliot 's failed candidacy as bishop in february <num> john appointed him to the benefice of colwall in herefordshire the king having the ability to make the appointment because giles de braose the bishop of hereford who would normally have made the appointment had recently died
also from this time comes foliot 's patronage of robert grosseteste the theologian and future bishop of lincoln
the new bishop accompanied peter des roches the bishop of winchester on a pilgrimage in <num>
because des roches travelled to spain to the shrine of st james at compostela and it is known that foliot accompanied him the statement by a medieval chronicler from dunstable that foliot 's destination was not certain being either rome or compostela should be discounted
foliot spent most of his tenure of office in his diocese only rarely attending the royal court or being assigned governmental duties
on <num> december <num> foliot assumed one of those duties when he took custody of hereford castle after it was surrendered by hubert de burgh during the redistribution of royal castles when de burgh ousted des roches from power
he also was appointed to determine the size of the royal forest in gloucestershire
foliot also founded a hospital in ledbury devoted to st katherine
he helped found alberbury priory a house of the grandmontine order
in his cathedral he reorganised the benefices and offices of the chapter as well as endowing further benefices
foliot died <num> august <num> after an illness that began in the spring
he was buried in hereford cathedral where his tomb survives
foliot appointed his younger brother thomas to offices in the diocese first as precentor in the <num> and then around <num> as treasurer of the cathedral chapter
the series of jeep wrangler based vehicles have been produced by automotive industries ltd
in upper nazareth under licence from chrysler since <year>
the vehicles fill a number of military roles including that of armoured infantry mobility vehicle and certain models are available for export as well as for the civilian market
production of an updated four @-@ door second generation model commenced in <year> despite some mixed messages from the storm 's primary customer the israel defense forces
development of a third generation vehicle based on the new jeep wrangler jk has been completed and significant production for both israeli and foreign customers is under way
a variant of the <year> jeep wrangler yj and the older cj @-@ <num> cj @-@ <num> wheelbase it is entirely produced in israel by automotive industries ltd
with the exception of the engines as their manufacture is not economically viable on the storm 's market scale
the storm was primarily meant to satisfy israeli military needs but capable long and short versions are produced for the local civilian market
like the jeep it has a conventional front @-@ engine design with a driver and passenger seated behind the engine and room for cargo or passengers behind them
it is powered by an amc <num>
<num> litre <num> @-@ cylinder in @-@ line petrol with fuel injection developing <num> hp <num> kw at <num> @,@ <num> rpm fitted with vortox <num> @-@ stage air cleaner or a volkswagen <num>
<num> litre <num> @-@ cylinder turbocharged diesel developing <num> kilowatts <num> hp at <num> @,@ <num> rpm
the front axle is fully floating and the rear axle is semi @-@ floating while a reinforced frame and body as well as good angles of approach and departure <num> ° and <num> ° for short frame <num> ° and <num>
<num> ° for long frame add to the storm 's off @-@ roading capability
the two production frame lengths <num>
<num> <num>
<num> and <num>
<num> metres <num>
<num> ft the latter of which was among the few such jeep @-@ derivatives in production in recent years were both available in civilian and military models
aside from the israeli market storms have long been exported to countries in south america asia and africa
a jeep @-@ managed production line in egypt whose vehicles are used by the egyptian armed forces was absorbed into the ail storm production after it closed in <year>
when armed with a <num> mm <num>
<num> in <num> recoilless rifle the vehicle is uniquely capable of firing directly over its blast guard equipped hood rather than in the perpendicular position required by most other vehicles
a variant of the extended version used in desert border patrol makes use of a high @-@ ceilinged canopy to allow a swivelling rear @-@ facing heavy machine @-@ gun mount while the canopy can be extended to provide a mobile command post
an air conditioned hardtop version of the extended model is often used by officers and a version developed for riot control has clear polycarbonate shielding along the rear sides and roof as well as gunports for less @-@ lethal weapons
the shielding allows for a wide field of view while at the same time protecting against firebombs and rock @-@ throwing
when the need for a light armoured vehicle became apparent to the israeli security forces ail 's engineering department designed a vehicle protection system from the bottom up integrating it into the existing vehicle in a manner that did not compromise its off @-@ road and other capabilities and that did not create the mechanical strain and increase in maintenance often associated with up @-@ armouring in part due to its computerized <num> horsepower <num> kw injected engine
the armour protects against <num>
<num> × <num> <num>
<num> in armour @-@ piercing ammunition and maintains a high protection @-@ to @-@ weight and cost ratio by employing idf approved advanced materials
the protected israeli configuration 's gross vehicle weight is <num> @,@ <num> kilograms <num> @,@ <num> lb though several varying protection levels are in use with individual units
another important asset are the storm 's narrow dimensions which allow it to traverse the narrow alleyways common to the casbahs of many middle eastern cities places that armoured humvees can only enter with great difficulty and minimal manoeuvrability if at all
full @-@ height rear doors which allow for the quick deployment of fully equipped troops into combat are touted as another advantage over similar vehicles
a small number were purchased directly by private consumers while larger numbers were acquired second @-@ hand from israeli government @-@ owned firms like the israel electric company and mekorot water company as well as national parks authority and israel police
modified storms are popular with off @-@ roading enthusiasts in israel
a number of significant changes have been incorporated into the new tj @-@ based storms stemming from soldiers feedback updated operational requirements and testing by goc army headquarters and logistics medical and the centers directorate
perhaps the most obvious change is the addition of dual passenger doors making the storm ii the first five @-@ door jeep wrangler derivative
other improvements include the change to a manual transmission with six forward speeds instead of the previous four and increased stability resulting from wider track axles than its predecessor
leaf springs were replaced with modern coil spring suspension front and rear and the storm ii features rear dana <num> axles and front tj dana <num> factory designed slip yoke eliminators and the added safety of standard airbags
soldiers comfort was addressed as well with the addition of standard rear air conditioning and a compact disc player
storm ii is also produced in an armoured version and is offered with an optional <num>
<num> litre vm motori turbodiesel automatic transmission right hand drive and run @-@ flat tyres
ail is capable of completing ten vehicles daily
due to recently passed tax laws a civilian version is not yet available in the local market
the announcement provoked threats of protests from ail 's management and labourers who had recently faced the blow of local humvee assembly ceasing due to budget considerations
the mdt david was chosen over the armoured version of the storm because the heavy storm was said to suffer from handling and reliability problems safety hazards and limited mission operability
however the idf said that the purchase of the david was to fill a temporary gap in production until the storm ii 's testing was completed and has since begun filling its commitment
based on the then new four @-@ door jeep wrangler jk design the mark iii is meant to address some of the shortfalls of the earlier mark ii
whereas the previous vehicle was an update of the original tk storm the storm iii was designed from the outset with a five @-@ door configuration
unlike the tj @-@ l the new jk storm has a much higher maximum load capacity in part due to heavier @-@ duty shock absorbers springs and axles necessary for an armored version
it includes a standard <num>
8l vm motori turbodiesel and automatic transmission
like the storm ii the mark iii was initially available only to the military with versions set to be delivered to the israel police in <year>
a civilian version would only be released if the local tax code was modified to allow it to compete with foreign imports of the same class
ail states that if such a thing would happen a petrol engine version could be offered
regarding export markets the storm <num> has already seen use in several countries especially in its armored version
a pair of production j8 's was tested by israeli web magazine jeepolog
com journalists in april <year>
it was dubbed probably the best jeep ever
a large rear compartment enables the storage of both cargo and communications equipment
this version comes equipped with an air conditioning system providing maximum comfort in hot climatic conditions
a roll over protection structure rops maximizes safety conditions for passengers
this version is especially suited to be fitted with various machine gun or special equipment mountings
though the season had no official bounds most tropical cyclone activity occurred during august and september
throughout the year fourteen tropical cyclones formed of which nine reached tropical storm intensity six were hurricanes
none of the hurricanes reached major hurricane intensity
tropical cyclones that did not approach populated areas or shipping lanes especially if they were relatively weak and of short duration may have remained undetected
because technologies such as satellite monitoring were not available until the <num> historical data on tropical cyclones from this period are often not reliable
as a result of a reanalysis project which analyzed the season in <year> an additional hurricane was added to hurdat
the year 's first tropical storm formed on may <num> off the northern coast of hispaniola
at the time this was a rare occurrence as only four other tropical disturbances were known to have formed prior during this period since then reanalysis of previous seasons has concluded that there were more than four tropical cyclones in may before <year>
the season 's final system was a tropical disturbance situated in the greater antilles which dissipated on november <num>
all three hurricanes in august brought flooding rainfall to areas of the united states
the first became the wettest tropical cyclone recorded in louisiana history
the second hurricane impacted regions of the southeastern united states producing record precipitation and killing at least <num> people
despite not making landfall the third hurricane in august interacted with a stationary front over the mid @-@ atlantic states resulting in localized flooding and thus making the tropical cyclone the wettest in new jersey history
this hurricane would also be the strongest in the hurricane season with maximum sustained winds of <num> mph <num> km h and a minimum barometric pressure of <num> mbar hpa <num>
<num> inhg making it a high @-@ end category <num> hurricane on the modern @-@ day saffir – simpson hurricane wind scale
activity decreased in september though a damaging hurricane swept through areas of the canadian maritimes resulting in large crop and infrastructural losses
two tropical cyclones of at least tropical storm strength were recorded in october though neither resulted in fatalities
collectively storms in the hurricane season caused <num> fatalities and <num>
<num> million in damages
the <year> south carolina hurricane which swept through areas of the southeastern united states in august was the most damaging and deadly of the tropical cyclones
moving northward the low became sufficiently organized to be classified as a tropical storm at <num> utc on may <num> southeast of turks island
at the time ship observations indicated that the disturbance had a well @-@ defined cyclonic circulation with the strongest winds situated in the northern semicircle of the cyclone
continuing northward the tropical storm gradually intensified and attained maximum sustained winds of <num> mph <num> km h by <num> utc on may <num>
the belgian ship m
s
lubrafol recorded a peripheral barometric pressure of <num> mbar hpa <num>
<num> inhg this was the lowest pressure measured in connection with the storm
the following day the tropical storm temporarily curved towards the east @-@ southeast before recurving back towards a northeast direction
at the same time the storm expanded in size and began to transition into an extratropical cyclone
by <num> utc the cyclone completed its extratropical transition due to the entrainment of colder air
the remnant system persisted until <num> utc on may <num>
initially a weak disturbance it moved generally westward slowly gaining in intensity
early on august <num> the depression attained tropical storm intensity
ships in the vicinity of the storm reported a much stronger tropical cyclone than initially suggested
after reaching hurricane strength on august <num> south of the mississippi river delta the storm strengthened further into a modern @-@ day category <num> hurricane with maximum sustained winds of <num> mph and a minimum barometric pressure of <num> mbar hpa <num>
<num> inhg at <num> utc on august <num>
the hurricane moved ashore near sabine pass texas later that day at peak strength
once inland the storm executed a sharp curve to the north and quickly weakened degenerating into a tropical storm on august <num> before dissipating over arkansas on august <num>
reports of a potentially destructive hurricane near the united states gulf coast forced thousands of residents in low @-@ lying areas to evacuate prior to the storm moving inland
offshore the hurricane generated rough seas and a strong storm surge peaking at <num>
<num> ft <num>
<num> m on the western edge of lake pontchartrain
the anomalously high tides flooded many of louisiana 's outlying islands inundating resorts
strong winds caused moderate infrastructural damage primarily in texas though its impact was mainly to communication networks along the u
s
gulf coast which were disrupted by the winds
however much of the property and crop damage wrought by the hurricane was due to the torrential rainfall it produced in low @-@ lying areas setting off record floods
rainfall peaked at <num>
<num> in <num> mm in miller island off louisiana making it the wettest tropical cyclone in state history
nineteen official weather stations in both texas and louisiana observed record <num> @-@ hour rainfall totals for the month of august as a result of the slow @-@ moving hurricane
property livestock and crops – especially cotton corn and pecan crops – were heavily damaged
entire ecosystems were also altered by the rainfall
overall the storm caused <num>
<num> million in damages and seven fatalities
initially moving westward the tropical storm gradually gained in intensity before making a sharp curve towards the north on august <num>
the storm continued in a northerly motion before a second curvature brought it in a generally westward direction on august <num>
shortly after the tropical storm reached hurricane intensity as a modern @-@ day category <num> hurricane
the hurricane eventually made landfall at peak intensity on hilton head island south carolina at <year> utc on september <num>
at the time the storm had maximum sustained winds of <num> mph <num> km h and a minimum central pressure of <num> mbar hpa <num>
<num> inhg equivalent to a modern @-@ day category <num> hurricane
once inland the tropical cyclone gradually weakened and recurved northeastward before dissipating over the appalachian mountains on august <num>
the hurricane dropped torrential rainfall over the southeast united states causing unprecedented devastation in the region
the storm was considered the worst to impact in the region in at least <num> years
precipitation peaked at <num>
<num> in <num> mm in idlewild north carolina
the heavy rainfall caused streams to greatly exceed their respective flood stages damaging waterfront property
many of the deaths occurred in north carolina where <num> people died
transportation was disrupted as a result of the debris scattered by the wind and rain
in caldwell county alone <num> percent of bridges were swept away
overall the storm caused <num> fatalities and <num> million in damages
moving slowly in a general west @-@ northwest motion the disturbance intensified reaching tropical storm strength on august <num> and subsequently hurricane intensity on august <num>
the hurricane passed within <num> mi <num> km of cape hatteras before recurving towards the northeast
however the hurricane continued to intensify and reached peak intensity as a modern @-@ day category <num> hurricane with maximum sustained winds of <num> mph <num> km h and a minimum barometric pressure of <num> mbar hpa <num>
<num> inhg though these statistical peaks were achieved at different times on september <num>
afterwards the tropical cyclone began a weakening trend as it proceeded northward and had degenerated into a tropical storm by the time it made its first landfall on nova scotia later that day
the storm transitioned into an extratropical cyclone the next day while making another landfall on new brunswick
the extratropical remnants persisted into quebec before merging with a larger extratropical system late on september <num>
despite not making landfall on the united states the hurricane caused widespread damage
extensive precautionary measures were undertaken across the coast particularly in new england
the heightened precautions were due in part to fears that effects from the storm would be similar to that of a devastating hurricane which struck the region two years prior
most of the damage associated with the hurricane occurred in new jersey where the combination of moisture from the hurricane and a stationary front produced record rainfall peaking at <num> in <num> mm in the town of ewan
this would make the storm the wettest in state history
the resultant floods damaged infrastructure mostly to road networks
damage in the state amounted to <num> million
further north in new england strong winds were reported though damage remained minimal
although the storm made two landfalls in atlantic canada damage too was minimal and was limited to several boating incidents caused by strong waves
overall the hurricane caused <num>
<num> million in damage primarily due to flooding in new jersey and seven fatalities
the disturbance gradually intensified throughout much of its early formative stages attaining tropical storm strength on september <num> further strengthening into a hurricane north of puerto rico occurred two days later
shortly thereafter the hurricane recurved northward and reached peak intensity the following day as a modern @-@ day category <num> hurricane with maximum sustained winds of <num> mph <num> km h and a minimum barometric pressure of at least <num> mbar hpa <num>
<num> inhg
the cyclone steadily weakened thereafter before making landfall on nova scotia on september <num> with winds of <num> mph <num> km h
moving into the gulf of saint lawrence later that day the storm transitioned into an extratropical cyclone
the remnant system curved eastward and passed over newfoundland before dissipating over the atlantic on september <num>
while off of the united states east coast the hurricane caused numerous shipping incidents most notably the stranding of the swedish freighter laponia off of cape hatteras north carolina on september <num>
two other boat incidents resulted in two deaths
the hurricane also brought strong winds of tropical storm @-@ force and snow over areas of new england
in atlantic canada a strong storm surge peaking at <num> ft <num>
<num> m above average sunk or damaged several ships and inundated cities
in new brunswick the waves hurt the lobster fishing industry
in nova scotia strong winds disrupted telecommunication and power services
the winds also severely damaged crops
roughly half of apple production in annapolis valley was lost during the storm resulting in around <num>
<num> million in economic losses
strong winds in new brunswick caused moderate to severe infrastructural damage and additional damages to crops occurred there
overall the hurricane caused three fatalities with two off of the united states and one in new brunswick
the following day the depression intensified into a tropical storm at <num> utc
the tropical storm made landfall on the mosquito coast of nicaragua at <year> utc with winds of <num> mph <num> km h
the cyclone weakened to a tropical depression over land but reintensified back to tropical storm strength upon entry into the gulf of honduras on september <num>
the cyclone 's northwest motion caused it to make a second landfall near the border of mexico and british honduras at <num> utc on september <num> as a slightly stronger system with winds of <num> mph <num> km h this would be the storm 's peak intensity
over the yucatán peninsula the tropical storm re @-@ weakened but later intensified once again once it reached the gulf of mexico
in the gulf the storm made a gradual curve northward before making a final landfall near lafayette louisiana at <num> utc on september <num> with winds of <num> mph <num> km h and a minimum barometric pressure of <num> mbar hpa <num>
<num> inhg
once inland the tropical cyclone curved eastward and weakened before dissipating the next day after becoming absorbed by a frontal boundary
upon making landfall the tropical storm produced strong winds over a wide area
the strongest winds were reported by a station in san antonio texas which reported <num> mph <num> km h winds far removed from the storm 's center these strong winds were likely due to squalls
heavy rainfall was also reported though the rains mainly occurred to the east of the passing tropical cyclone
precipitation peaked at <num> in <num> mm in ville platte louisiana
the tropical storm produced three tornadoes over the southern united states which collecitvely caused <num> @,@ <num> in damage and caused two fatalities
two of the tornadoes formed in mississippi while one formed in louisiana
several other people were also injured by the tornadoes
the low @-@ pressure area later became sufficiently organized to be classified as a tropical storm at <num> utc on september <num>
the disturbance quickly organized after tropical cyclogenesis and reached a strength equivalent to a modern @-@ day category <num> hurricane strength at <year> utc later that day
the american steamship otho encountered the system that day and reported gale force winds in conjunction with a peripheral barometric pressure of <num> mbar hpa <num>
<num> inhg
the tropical cyclone continued to the east @-@ northeast where it gradually intensified
at <num> utc on september <num> the hurricane attained modern @-@ day category <num> hurricane intensity with winds of <num> mbar <num> km h a peak which would be maintained for at least the following <num> hours
a second steamship the lobito reported hurricane @-@ force winds along with a minimum pressure of <num> mbar hpa <num>
<num> inhg this would be the lowest pressure measured associated with the tropical cyclone
after reaching peak intensity the hurricane began a weakening trend and degenerated to a category <num> hurricane at <num> utc as it passed over the azores
the following day the hurricane recurved westward where it weakened before transitioning into an extratropical cyclone on september <num>
this remnant system subsequently dissipated
as the hurricane passed over the azores several weather stations reported low barometric pressures with the lowest being a measurement of <num> mbar hpa <num>
<num> inhg on terceira island at <num> utc on september <num>
as a result of the impending storm several pan am clipper flights to the archipelago were suspended for three consecutive days
the maximum reported gust in the azores was an observation of <num> mph <num> km h on september <num>
as a result of moving slowly over the islands torrential rainfall was also reported
at angra do heroísmo <num>
<num> in <num> mm of precipitation was reported in a four @-@ day accounting for a third of the station 's yearly average rainfall
strong storm surge was reported at the same location
the waves swept boats away from the coasts of islands
further inland there was extensive damage to homes and crops though no people died
despite evidence that the system had distinct tropical characteristics it was not operationally added to hurdat
the area of disturbed weather quickly became well @-@ organized and was analyzed to have become a tropical depression at <num> utc on october <num>
initially the tropical cyclone moved very slowly towards the west and then the northwest
shortly after formation the disturbance intensified into a tropical storm at <year> utc later that day
the s
s
cristobal provided the first indications of a tropical cyclone in the region after reporting strong gusts and low pressures north of the panama canal zone during that evening
continuing to intensify the storm reached hurricane intensity at <num> utc on october <num>
several vessels in the storm 's vicinity reported strong gusts and rough seas generated by the storm
later that day at <num> utc the ship s
s
castilla reported a minimum pressure of <num> mbar hpa <num>
<num> inhg near the periphery of the storm
based on this observation the hurricane was estimated to have reached intensity at the same time with winds of <num> mph <num> km h
the hurricane subsequently curved west and then southwest before making its only landfall in northern nicaragua at <year> utc on october <num> at peak intensity
once inland the tropical cyclone rapidly weakened over mountainous terrain and dissipated at <num> utc the following day
reports of damage were limited though a report stated that considerable damage had occurred where the hurricane made landfall
at <num> utc the following day the area of disturbed weather became organized and was analyzed to have become a tropical storm southeast of inagua based on nearby vessel reports
initially the storm drifted northward but later began to accelerate towards the northeast after a roughly <num> @-@ hour period
at <num> utc on september <num> the disturbance slightly gained in intensity to attain maximum wind speeds of <num> mph <num> km h these would be the strongest winds associated with the storm as a fully tropical cyclone
a reanalysis of the system indicated that due to a lack of definite tropical features the storm may have had been a subtropical cyclone
on october <num> the system became increasingly asymmetric and had developed frontal boundaries allowing for it to be classified as an extratropical cyclone at <num> utc that day
once transitioning into an extratropical system the storm continued to intensified as it moved northward
on october <num> the system was analyzed to have a minimum pressure of at least <num> mbar hpa <num>
<num> inhg after passing to the southeast of bermuda
at <num> utc later that day the cyclone reached an extratropical peak intensity with winds of <num> mph <num> km h just east of newfoundland
had the storm been tropical at the time it would have been classified as a modern @-@ day category <num> hurricane
subsequently the extratropical storm curved eastward where it persisted before dissipating by <year> utc on september <num>
due to their weak intensity however they were not added to hurdat
on september <num> a closed low @-@ pressure area was detected in the open atlantic ocean southeast of bermuda and was analyzed as a tropical depression
at the time the disturbance had a minimum pressure of at least <num> mbar hpa <num>
<num> inhg
the depression initially moved to the southeast but later recurved towards the northwest over the next two days
on september <num> the s
s
west kebar en route for boston massachusetts reported winds of <num> mph <num> km h which would be considered as tropical storm @-@ force winds
the depression later moved to the northeast before it was absorbed by a stationary front on september <num>
since there was only one report that the disturbance may have reached tropical storm intensity it was not included in hurdat
later on september <num> a trough was detected in a similar region in the atlantic where the first depression formed
the trough later became sufficiently organized to be classified as a tropical depression
the cyclone moved slowly to the east and did not further intensify before dissipating on september <num>
on october <num> a large elongated extratropical cyclone extended across the atlantic ocean with a pressure of at most <num> mbar hpa <num>
<num> inhg
the following day the low @-@ pressure area became more narrow and well @-@ defined with its central pressure deepening to <num> mph hpa <num>
<num> inhg
on october <num> the extratropical system was analyzed to have become a tropical depression
the low moved slowly to the northeast and gradually weakened before dissipating on october <num>
on october <num> offshore observations indicated that a tropical depression had developed north of the bahamas
the following day however the depression became less defined and degenerated into a trough of low pressure
on october <num> two ships listed in the international comprehensive ocean @-@ atmosphere data set reported winds of <num> mph <num> km h off the coast of north carolina
however since these reports occurred in a higher pressure gradient the system was not included in hurdat
on november <num> a trough of low @-@ pressure was analyzed near the lesser antilles
the system moved westward into the caribbean sea without much organization
on november <num> the low @-@ pressure area moved south of cuba and became sufficiently organized to be considered a tropical depression with a pressure of at least <num> mbar hpa <num>
<num> inhg
the depression moved over cuba and into the atlantic where it dissipated the following day
on november <num> a second system was detected northeast of bermuda with a pressure of <num> mbar hpa <num>
<num> inhg though it remained unclear whether the two systems were related
according to brown a nightingale had built its nest near the house keats and brown shared in the spring of <year>
inspired by the bird 's song keats composed the poem in one day
it soon became one of his <year> odes and was first published in annals of the fine arts the following july
ode to a nightingale is a personal poem that describes keats 's journey into the state of negative capability
the tone of the poem rejects the optimistic pursuit of pleasure found within keats 's earlier poems and rather explores the themes of nature transience and mortality the latter being particularly personal to keats
the nightingale described within the poem experiences a type of death but does not actually die
instead the songbird is capable of living through its song which is a fate that humans cannot expect
the poem ends with an acceptance that pleasure cannot last and that death is an inevitable part of life
in the poem keats imagines the loss of the physical world and sees himself dead — as a sod over which the nightingale sings
the contrast between the immortal nightingale and mortal man sitting in his garden is made all the more acute by an effort of the imagination
the presence of weather is noticeable in the poem as spring came early in <year> bringing nightingales all over the heath
sometime between these two he wrote ode to a nightingale
it is possible that ode to a nightingale was written between <num> april and <num> may <year> based on weather conditions and similarities between images in the poem and those in a letter sent to fanny keats on may day
the poem was composed at the hampstead house keats shared with brown possibly while sitting beneath a plum tree in the garden
according to keats friend brown keats finished the ode in just one morning in the spring of <year> a nightingale had built her nest near my house
keats felt a tranquil and continual joy in her song and one morning he took his chair from the breakfast @-@ table to the grass @-@ plot under a plum @-@ tree where he sat for two or three hours
when he came into the house i perceived he had some scraps of paper in his hand and these he was quietly thrusting behind the books
on inquiry i found those scraps four or five in number contained his poetic feelings on the song of the nightingale
brown 's account is personal as he claimed the poem was directly influenced by his house and preserved by his own doing
however keats relied on both his own imagination and other literature as sources for his depiction of the nightingale
the exact date of ode to a nightingale as well as ode on indolence ode on melancholy and ode on a grecian urn is unknown as keats dated all as may <year>
however he worked on the four poems together and there is a unity in both their stanza forms and their themes
the exact order the poems were written in is also unknown but they form a sequence within their structures
while keats was writing ode on a grecian urn and the other poems brown transcribed copies of the poems and submitted them to richard woodhouse
during this time benjamin haydon keats friend was given a copy of ode to a nightingale and he shared the poem with the editor of the annals of the fine arts james elmes
elmes paid keats a small sum of money and the poem was published in the july issue
the poem was later included in keats <year> collection of poems lamia isabella the eve of st agnes and other written by pratyush kumar poems
there is further evidence of this in the structure of the poems because keats combines two different types of lyrical poetry in an experimental way the odal hymn and the lyric of questioning voice that responds to the odal hymn
this combination of structures is similar to that in ode on a grecian urn
in both poems the dual form creates a sort of dramatic element within the poem
the stanza forms of the poem is a combination of elements from petrarchan sonnets and shakespearean sonnets
when it came to vowel forms keats incorporated a pattern of alternating historically short and long vowel sounds in his ode
in particular line <num> and purple @-@ stained mouth has the historical pattern of short followed by long followed by short and followed by long
this alteration is continued in longer lines including line <num> away away for i will fly to thee which contains five pairs of alternations
however other lines such as line <num> or emptied some dull opiate to the drains rely on a pattern of five short vowels followed by long and short vowel pairings until they end with a long vowel
these are not the only combination patterns present and there are patterns of two short vowels followed by a long vowel in other lines including <num> <num> and <num> which are repeated twice and then followed up with two sets of short and then long vowel pairs
this reliance on vowel sounds is not unique to this ode but is common to keats 's other <year> odes and his eve of st
agnes
the poem incorporates a complex reliance on assonance — the repetition of vowel sounds — in a conscious pattern as found in many of his poems
such a reliance on assonance is found in very few english poems
within ode to a nightingale an example of this pattern can be found in line <num> already with thee tender is the night where the ea of already connects with the e of tender and the i of with connects with the i of is
this same pattern is found again in line <num> i cannot see what flowers are at my feet with the a of cannot linking with the a of at and the ee of see linking with the ee of feet
this system of assonance can be found in approximately a tenth of the lines of keats 's later poetry
when it came to other sound patterns keats relied on double or triple caesuras in approximately <num> of lines throughout the <year> odes
an example from ode to a nightingale can be found within line <num> the grass the thicket and the fruit @-@ tree wild as the pauses after the commas are a masculine pause
furthermore keats began to reduce the amount of latin @-@ based words and syntax that he relied on in his poetry which in turn shortened the length of the words that dominate the poem
there is also an emphasis on words beginning with consonants especially those that begin with b p or v
these three consonants are relied on heavily in the first stanza and they are used syzygically to add a musical tone within the poem
in terms of poetic meter keats relies on spondee throughout his <year> odes and in just over <num> of his lines within ode to a nightingale including line <num> and line <num> to walter jackson bate the use of spondees in lines <num> – <num> creates a feeling of slow flight and in the final stanza
the distinctive use of scattered spondees together with initial inversion lend s an approximate phonetic suggestion of the peculiar spring and bounce of the bird in its flight

<num> forlorn the very word is like a bell to toll me back from thee to my sole self adieu the fancy cannot cheat so well as she is famed to do deceiving elf
in the words of richard fogle the principal stress of the poem is a struggle between ideal and actual inclusive terms which however contain more particular antitheses of pleasure and pain of imagination and common sense reason of fullness and privation of permanence and change of nature and the human of art and life freedom and bondage waking and dream
of course the nightingale 's song is the dominant image and dominant voice within the ode
the nightingale is also the object of empathy and praise within the poem
however the nightingale and the discussion of the nightingale is not simply about the bird or the song but about human experience in general
this is not to say that the song is a simple metaphor but it is a complex image that is formed through the interaction of the conflicting voices of praise and questioning
on this theme david perkins summarizes the way ode to a nightingale and ode on a grecian urn perform this when he says we are dealing with a talent indeed an entire approach to poetry in which symbol however necessary may possibly not satisfy as the principal concern of poetry any more than it could with shakespeare but is rather an element in the poetry and drama of human reactions
however there is a difference between an urn and a nightingale in that the nightingale is not an eternal entity
furthermore in creating any aspect of the nightingale immortal during the poem the narrator separates any union that he can have with the nightingale
the nightingale 's song within the poem is connected to the art of music in a way that the urn in ode on a grecian urn is connected to the art of sculpture
as such the nightingale would represent an enchanting presence and unlike the urn is directly connected to nature
as natural music the song is for beauty and lacks a message of truth
keats follows coleridge 's belief as found in the nightingale in separating from the world by losing himself in the bird 's song
although keats favours a female nightingale over coleridge 's masculine bird both reject the traditional depiction of the nightingale as related to the tragedy of philomela
their songbird is a happy nightingale that lacks the melancholic feel of previous poetic depictions
the bird is only a voice within the poem but it is a voice that compels the narrator to join with in and forget the sorrows of the world
however there is tension in that the narrator holds keats 's guilt regarding the death of tom keats his brother
the song 's conclusion represents the result of trying to escape into the realm of fancy
like percy bysshe shelley ’ s to a skylark keats ’ s narrator listens to a bird song but listening to the song within “ ode to a nightingale ” is almost painful and similar to death
the narrator seeks to be with the nightingale and abandons his sense of vision in order to embrace the sound in an attempt to share in the darkness with the bird
as the poem ends the trance caused by the nightingale is broken and the narrator is left wondering if it was a real vision or just a dream
the poem reliance on the process of sleeping common to keats 's poems and ode to a nightingale shares many of the same themes as keats 's sleep and poetry and eve of st
agnes
this further separates the image of the nightingale 's song from its closest comparative image the urn as represented in ode on a grecian urn
the nightingale is distant and mysterious and even disappears at the end of the poem
the dream image emphasizes the shadowiness and elusiveness of the poem
these elements make it impossible for there to be a complete self @-@ identification with the nightingale but it also allows for self @-@ awareness to permeate throughout the poem albeit in an altered state
midway through the poem there is a split between the two actions of the poem the first attempts to identify with the nightingale and its song and the second discusses the convergence of the past with the future while experiencing the present
this second theme is reminiscent of keats 's view of human progression through the mansion of many apartments and how man develops from experiencing and wanting only pleasure to understanding truth as a mixture of both pleasure and pain
the elysian fields and the nightingale 's song in the first half of the poem represent the pleasurable moments that overwhelm the individual like a drug
however the experience does not last forever and the body is left desiring it until the narrator feels helpless without the pleasure
instead of embracing the coming truth the narrator clings to poetry to hide from the loss of pleasure
poetry does not bring about the pleasure that the narrator original asks for but it does liberate him from his desire for only pleasure
responding to this emphasis on pleasure albert guerard jr
argues that the poem contains a longing not for art but a free reverie of any kind
the form of the poem is that of progression by association so that the movement of feeling is at the mercy of words evoked by chance such words as fade and forlorn the very words that like a bell toll the dreamer back to his sole self
however fogle points out that the terms guerard emphasizes are associational translations and that guerard misunderstands keats 's aesthetic
after all the acceptance of the loss of pleasure by the end of the poem is an acceptance of life and in turn of death
death was a constant theme that permeated aspects of keats poetry because he was exposed to death of his family members throughout his life
within the poem there are many images of death
the nightingale experiences a sort of death and even the god apollo experiences death but his death reveals his own divine state
as perkins explains but of course the nightingale is not thought to be literally dying
the point is that the deity or the nightingale can sing without dying
but as the ode makes clear man cannot — or at least not in a visionary way
with this theme of a loss of pleasure and inevitable death the poem according to claude finney describes the inadequacy of the romantic escape from the world of reality to the world of ideal beauty
earl wasserman essentially agrees with finney but he extended his summation of the poem to incorporate the themes of keats 's mansion of many apartments when he says the core of the poem is the search for the mystery the unsuccessful quest for light within its darkness and this leads only to an increasing darkness or a growing recognition of how impenetrable the mystery is to mortals
with these views in mind the poem recalls keats 's earlier view of pleasure and an optimistic view of poetry found within his earlier poems especially sleep and poetry and rejects them
this loss of pleasure and incorporation of death imagery lends the poem a dark air which connects ode to a nightingale with keats other poems that discuss the demonic nature of poetic imagination including lamia
in the poem keats imagines the loss of the physical world and sees himself dead — he uses an abrupt almost brutal word for it — as a sod over which the nightingale sings
the contrast between the immortal nightingale and mortal man sitting in his garden is made all the more acute by an effort of the imagination
an anonymous review of keats 's poetry that ran in the august and october <year> scots magazine stated amongst the minor poems we prefer the ode to the nightingale
indeed we are inclined to prefer it beyond every other poem in the book but let the reader judge
the third and seventh stanzas have a charm for us which we should find it difficult to explain
we have read this ode over and over again and every time with increased delight
at the same time leigh hunt wrote a review of keats 's poem for the <num> august and <num> august <year> the indicator as a specimen of the poems which are all lyrical we must indulge ourselves in quoting entire the ode to a nightingale
there is that mixture in it of real melancholy and imaginative relief which poetry alone presents us in her charmed cup and which some over @-@ rational critics have undertaken to find wrong because it is not true
it does not follow that what is not true to them is not true to others
if the relief is real the mixture is good and sufficing
john scott in an anonymous review for the september <year> edition of the london magazine argued for the greatness of keats 's poetry as exemplified by poems including ode to a nightingale the injustice which has been done to our author 's works in estimating their poetical merit rendered us doubly anxious on opening his last volume to find it likely to seize fast hold of general sympathy and thus turn an overwhelming power against the paltry traducers of talent more eminently promising in many respects than any the present age has been called upon to encourage
we have not found it to be quite all that we wished in this respect--and it would have been very extraordinary if we had for our wishes went far beyond reasonable expectations
but we have found it of a nature to present to common understandings the poetical power with which the author 's mind is gifted in a more tangible and intelligible shape than that in which it has appeared in any of his former compositions
it is therefore calculated to throw shame on the lying vulgar spirit in which this young worshipper in the temple of the muses has been cried @-@ down whatever questions may still leave to be settled as to the kind and degree of his poetical merits
take for instance as proof of the justice of our praise the following passage from an ode to the nightingale --it is distinct noble pathetic and true the thoughts have all chords of direct communication with naturally @-@ constituted hearts the echoes of the strain linger bout the depths of human bosoms
in a review for the <num> january <year> london journal hunt claimed that while keats wrote the poem the poet had then his mortal illness upon him and knew it
never was the voice of death sweeter
david moir in <year> used the even of st agnes to claim we have here a specimen of descriptive power luxuriously rich and original but the following lines from the ode to a nightingale flow from a far more profound fountain of inspiration
at the end of the <num> century robert bridges 's analysis of the poem became a dominant view and would influence later interpretations of the poem
bridges in <year> declared that the poem was the best of keats 's odes but he thought that the poem contained too much artificial language
in particular he emphasised the use of the word forlorn and the last stanza as being examples of keats 's artificial language
in two odes of keats 's <year> william c wilkinson suggested that ode to a nightingale is deeply flawed because it contains too many incoherent musings that failed to supply a standard of logic that would allow the reader to understand the relationship between the poet and the bird
however herbert grierson arguing in <year> believed nightingale to be superior to ode on a grecian urn ode on melancholy and ode to psyche arguing the exact opposite of wilkinson as he stated that nightingale along with to autumn showed a greater amount of logical thought and more aptly presented the cases they were intended to make
these are the vision
the rest is only poetry
in <year> alexander mackie argued the nightingale and the lark for long monopolised poetic idolatry--a privilege they enjoyed solely on account of their pre @-@ eminence as song birds
keats 's ode to a nightingale and shelley 's ode to a skylark are two of the glories of english literature but both were written by men who had no claim to special or exact knowledge of ornithology as such
sidney colvin in <year> argued throughout this ode keats ’ s genius is at its height
imagination cannot be more rich and satisfying felicity of phrase and cadence cannot be more absolute than in the several contrasted stanzas calling for the draft of southern vintage … to praise the art of a passage like that in the fourth stanza … to praise or comment on a stroke of art like this is to throw doubt on the reader ’ s power to perceive it for himself
bridge 's view of ode to a nightingale was taken up by h
w
garrod in his <year> analysis of keats 's poems
like albert gerard would argue later in <year> garrod believed that the problem within keats 's poem was his emphasis on the rhythm and the language instead of the main ideas of the poem
when describing the fourth stanza of the poem maurice ridley in <year> claimed and so comes the stanza with that remarkable piece of imagination at the end which feels the light as blown by the breezes one of those characteristic sudden flashes with which keats fires the most ordinary material
he later declared of the seventh stanza and now for the great stanza in which the imagination is fanned to yet whiter heat the stanza that would i suppose by common consent be taken along with kubla khan as offering us the distilled sorceries of romanticism
he concluded on the stanza that i do not believe that any reader who has watched keats at work on the more exquisitely finished of the stanzas in the eve of st
agnes and seen this craftsman slowly elaborating and refining will ever believe that this perfect stanza was achieved with the easy fluency with which in the draft we have it was obviously written down
in <year> f
r
leavis wrote one remembers the poem both as recording and as being for the reader an indulgence
following leavis cleanth brooks and robert penn warren in a <year> essay saw the poem as a very rich poem
it contains some complications which we must not gloss over if we are to appreciate the depth and significance of the issues engaged
brooks would later argue in the well @-@ wrought urn <year> that the poem was thematically unified while contradicting many of the negative criticisms lodged against the poem
richard fogle responded to the critical attack on keats 's emphasis on rhyme and language put forth by garrod gerard and others in <year>
his argument was similar to brooks that the poem was thematically coherent and that there is a poet within the poem that is different from keats the writer of the poem
as such keats consciously chose the shift in the themes of the poem and the contrasts within the poem represent the pain felt when comparing the real world to an ideal world found within the imagination
fogle also responded directly to the claims made by leavis i find mr
leavis too austere but he points out a quality which keats plainly sought for
his profusion and prodigality is however modified by a principle of sobriety
it is possible that fogle 's statements were a defense of romanticism as a group that was both respectable in terms of thought and poetic ability
wasserman following in <year> claimed that of all keats poems it is probably the ode to a nightingale that has most tormented the critic
in any reading of the ode to a nightingale the turmoil will not down
forces contend wildly within the poem not only without resolution but without possibility of resolution and the reader comes away from his experience with the sense that he has been in a wild abyss
he then explained it is this turbulence i suspect that has led allen tate to believe the ode at least tries to say everything that poetry an say
but i propose it is the ode on a grecian urn that succeeds in saying what poetry can say and that the other ode attempts to say all that the poet can
c
pettet returned to the argument that the poem lacked a structure and emphasized the word forlorn as evidence of his view
in his <year> work pettet did praise the poem as he declared the ode to a nightingale has a special interest in that most of us would probably regard it as the most richly representative of all keats ’ s poems
two reasons for this quality are immediately apparent there is its matchless evocation of that late spring and early summer season … and there is its exceptional degree of distillation of concentrated recollection
david perkins felt the need to defend the use of the word forlorn and claimed that it described the feeling from the impossibility of not being able to live in the world of the imagination
when praising the poem in <year> perkins claimed although the ode to a nightingale ranges more widely than the ode on a grecian urn the poem can also be regarded as the exploration or testing out of a symbol and compared with the urn as a symbol the nightingale would seem to have both limitations and advantages
walter jackson bate also made a similar defense of the word forlorn by claiming that the world described by describing the impossibility of reaching that land
when describing the poem compared to the rest of english poetry bate argued in <year> ode to a nightingale is among the greatest lyrics in english and the only one written with such speed we are free to doubt whether any poem in english of comparable length and quality has been composed so quickly
in <year> robert gittins stated it may not be wrong to regard ode on indolence and ode on melancholy as keats 's earlier essays in this ode form and the great nightingale and grecian urn as his more finished and later works
from the late <num> onward many of the yale school of critics describe the poem as a reworking of john milton 's poetic diction but they argued that poem revealed that keats lacked the ability of milton as a poet
the critics harold bloom <year> leslie brisman <year> paul fry <year> john hollander <year> and cynthia chase <year> all focused on the poem with milton as a progenitor to ode to a nightingale while ignoring other possibilities including shakespeare who was emphasised as being the source of many of keats 's phrases
responding to the claims about milton and keats 's shortcomings critics like r
s
white <year> and willard spiegelman <year> used the shakespearean echoes to argue for a multiplicity of sources for the poem to claim that keats was not trying to respond just milton or escape from his shadow
instead ode to a nightingale was an original poem as white claimed the poem is richly saturated in shakespeare yet the assimilations are so profound that the ode is finally original and wholly keatsian
similarly spiegelman claimed that shakespeare 's a midsummer night 's dream had flavored and ripened the later poem
this was followed in <year> by jonathan bate claiming that keats was left enriched by the voice of shakespeare the immortal bird
focusing on the quality of the poem stuart sperry argued in <year> ode to a nightingale is the supreme expression in all keats 's poetry of the impulse to imaginative escape that flies in the face of the knowledge of human limitation the impulse fully expressed in away away for i will fly to thee
wolf hirst in <year> described the poem as justly celebrated and claimed that since this movement into an eternal realm of song is one of the most magnificent in literature the poet 's return to actuality is all the more shattering
helen vendler continued the earlier view that the poem was artificial but added that the poem was an attempt to be aesthetic and spontaneous that was later dropped
in <year> she argued in its absence of conclusiveness and its abandonment to reverie the poem appeals to readers who prize it as the most personal the most apparently spontaneous the most immediately beautiful and the most confessional of keats 's odes
i believe that the events of the ode as it unfolds in time have more logic however than is usually granted them and that they are best seen in relation to keats 's pursuit of the idea of music as a nonrepresentational art
in a review of contemporary criticism of ode to a nightingale in <year> james o 'rouke claimed that to judge from the volume the variety and the polemical force of the modern critical responses engendered there have been few moments in english poetic history as baffling as keats 's repetition of the word forlorn
when referring to the reliance of the ideas of john dryden and william hazlitt within the poem poet laureate andrew motion in <year> argued whose notion of poetry as a movement from personal consciousness to an awareness of suffering humanity it perfectly illustrates
scott fitzgerald took the title of his novel tender is the night from the <num> line of the ode
according to ildikó de papp carrington keats wording when sick for home she stood in tears amid the alien corn seems to be echoed in by alice munro 's save the reaper <year> the end of which reads eve would lie down

the fleet departed for a cruise in the north sea on <num> february jellicoe had intended to use the harwich force to sweep the heligoland bight but bad weather prevented operations in the southern north sea
as a result the operation was confined to the northern end of the sea
on the night of <num> march iron duke and the rest of the fleet sailed from scapa flow to support the battlecruiser fleet and other light forces that raided the german zeppelin base at tondern
on <num> april the grand fleet conducted a demonstration off horns reef to distract the germans while the russian navy relaid its defensive minefields in the baltic sea
the fleet returned to scapa flow on <num> april and refuelled before proceeding south in response to intelligence reports that the germans were about to launch a raid on lowestoft
the grand fleet did not arrive in the area until after the germans had withdrawn
during <num> – <num> may the fleet conducted another demonstration off horns reef to keep german attention focused on the north sea
the fleet sailed in concert with rear admiral franz von hipper 's five battlecruisers and supporting cruisers and torpedo boats
the royal navy 's room <num> had intercepted and decrypted german radio traffic containing plans of the operation
the admiralty ordered the grand fleet of <num> dreadnoughts and <num> battlecruisers to sortie the night before to cut off and destroy the high seas fleet
on the day of the battle marlborough was stationed toward the rear of the british line in the <num> division of the 1st battle squadron
the initial action was fought primarily by the british and german battlecruiser formations in the afternoon but by <num> <num> the grand fleet approached the scene
fifteen minutes later jellicoe gave the order to turn and deploy the fleet for action
the transition from their cruising formation caused congestion with the rear divisions forcing marlborough and many of the other ships to reduce speed to <num> knots <num> km h <num>
<num> mph to avoid colliding with each other
the british ships initially had poor visibility and marlborough could only faintly make out a group of german kaiser @-@ class battleships at <num> <num>
in the span of four minutes she fired seven salvos first at <num> @,@ <num> yards <num> @,@ <num> m and then at <num> @,@ <num> yards <num> @,@ <num> m
marlborough 's gunners claimed to have made hits with the <num> and <num> salvos but these claims are unlikely
her guns were then masked by a burning cruiser probably the armoured cruiser hms warrior
marlborough joined the group of battleships battering the german light cruiser sms wiesbaden at <num> <num>
she fired five salvos before a premature detonation in the right barrel of a turret disabled the gun
she also engaged the ship with her secondary battery
at <num> <num> marlborough again engaged what appeared to be a kaiser @-@ class ship firing a salvo before the german vessel disappeared into the haze
during the engagement with wiesbaden the german cruiser launched one or two torpedoes at around <num> <num> one of which struck marlborough around the starboard diesel generator room
the detonation tore a <num> @-@ foot <num>
<num> m hole in the hull and causing significant flooding that forced the forward boilers on that side of the ship to be extinguished and reduced the ship 's speed to <num> knots <num> km h <num> mph
burney initially reported to jellicoe that his ship had struck a mine or had been hit by a torpedo at <num> <num>
several more torpedoes this time from the torpedo boat sms v48 forced marlborough and the rest of the ships in her division to take evasive action
at <num> <num> marlborough engaged wiesbaden again firing four salvos at ranges of <num> @,@ <num> to <num> @,@ <num> yards <num> @,@ <num> to <num> @,@ <num> m
she hit the german cruiser with probably three shells from the last two salvos and these finally neutralised the ship although it took several more hours before wiesbaden sank
marlborough then shifted fire to the könig @-@ class battleships leading the german line at <num> <num>
she fired thirteen salvos in the span of six minutes at sms grosser kurfürst at ranges of <num> @,@ <num> to <num> @,@ <num> yards <num> @,@ <num> to <num> @,@ <num> m scoring three hits though she incorrectly claimed a fourth hit
during this phase of the battle marlborough fired two torpedoes both of which missed their targets the first at wiesbaden at <num> <num> and the second at sms kaiser at <num> <num>
by about <num> <num> marlborough 's pumps had contained the flooding in the boiler rooms but she took on a list of around <num> – <num> degrees
instead of using counter @-@ flooding to minimise the list her crew attempted to correct the list by using coal and oil from the starboard bunkers first
the list caused the generators supplying power to the main battery turrets to flood hampering the gun crews particularly as shells were transferred from the magazines to the turrets
the blast from the torpedo was so powerful that forty watertight compartments were damaged though the torpedo bulkhead localised most of the damage and the more badly damaged compartments were sufficiently shored up
three more torpedoes approached marlborough at <num> <num>
she evaded the first two and the third harmlessly passed under the ship
after the opposing fleets disengaged late in the day the grand fleet steamed south in an attempt to cut off the retreating germans and destroy them the following morning
the <num> division was slowed down by marlborough which could make no more than <num>
<num> kn <num>
<num> km h <num>
<num> mph by this point
by around <num> <num> on <num> june the <num> division was about <num> nmi <num> km <num> mi behind the rest of the fleet
at that time the bulkheads in the starboard forward boiler room started to give way under the strain forcing marlborough to reduce speed to <num> knots <num> km h <num> mph
the damage control teams believed that if the main battery were to fire the shoring supporting the damaged bulkheads would give way greatly increasing the risk to the ship
jellicoe detached the ship to proceed independently to rosyth or the tyne burney had ordered the scout cruiser fearless to come alongside to transfer him to the battleship revenge
marlborough thereafter proceeded northward at a speed of <num> knots <num> km h <num> mph
fearless rejoined marlborough around <num> <num> and both ships briefly fired at the german zeppelin l11
commodore reginald tyrwhitt 's harwich force had been ordered to reinforce the grand fleet particularly to relieve ships low on fuel they departed at <num> <num> but this was too late for them to reach the fleet by morning so jellicoe ordered tyrwhitt to detach destroyers to escort marlborough back to port
on the way marlborough and fearless encountered the british submarines g3 and g5 the two submarines prepared to attack the ships but fortunately recognised them before they launched torpedoes
by <num> <num> eight destroyers from the harwich force had joined marlborough and another pump had been lowered into the flooded boiler room
at around <num> <num> the pump was being moved to clean it when the roll of the ship threw the pump into the damaged bulkhead knocking the shores loose
water flooded into the ship and marlborough 's captain ordered fearless and the destroyers to prepare to come alongside to rescue the crew if the flooding worsened at <num> <num> on <num> june
a diver was sent into the boiler room at that time and he was able to keep the pump clean which slowly reduced the water level in the ship
jellicoe ordered marlborough to proceed to the humber for temporary repairs
while there her forward main battery and <num> @-@ inch magazines were emptied to lighten the ship more pumps were brought aboard and the shoring supporting the damaged bulkhead was reinforced
on the morning of <num> june the ship left the humber for the tyne where she would receive permanent repairs escorted by four destroyers from the harwich force
in the course of the battle marlborough had fired <num> shells from her main battery <num> rounds from her secondary guns and five torpedoes
the torpedo hit had killed two men and wounded another two
she was repaired by the armstrong whitworth shipyard at jarrow with the work lasting until <num> august after which she departed for cromarty arriving on <num> august
during the repair work an extra <num> t <num> long tons <num> short tons of armour plating was added to the ship primarily over the magazines
these alterations were the result of the british experience at jutland where three battlecruisers had been destroyed by magazine explosions
british signals intelligence decrypted german wireless transmissions allowing jellicoe enough time to deploy the grand fleet in an attempt to engage in a decisive battle
both sides withdrew the following day after their opponents submarines inflicted losses in the action of <num> august the british cruisers nottingham and falmouth were both torpedoed and sunk by german u @-@ boats and the german battleship sms westfalen was damaged by the british submarine e23
after returning to port jellicoe issued an order that prohibited risking the fleet in the southern half of the north sea due to the overwhelming risk from mines and u @-@ boats
in february <year> revenge replaced marlborough as the 1st battle squadron flagship she thereafter served as the second command flagship
she was briefly replaced in this role by emperor of india in may and she temporarily became a private ship
toward the end of the year the germans began using destroyers and light cruisers to raid the british convoys to norway this forced the british to deploy capital ships to protect the convoys
on <num> april <year> the german fleet sortied in an attempt to catch one of the isolated british squadrons though the convoy had already passed safely
the grand fleet sortied too late the following day to catch the retreating germans though the battlecruiser sms moltke was torpedoed and badly damaged by the submarine hms e42
in <year> marlborough and her sisters received flying @-@ off platforms on their b and q turrets to handle reconnaissance aircraft
following the capitulation of germany in november <year> the allies interned most of the high seas fleet in scapa flow
the fleet rendezvoused with the british light cruiser cardiff which led the ships to the allied fleet that was to escort the germans to scapa flow
the massive fleet consisted of some <num> british american and french warships
the fleet remained in captivity during the negotiations that ultimately produced the treaty of versailles
reuter believed that the british intended to seize the german ships on <num> june <year> which was the deadline for germany to have signed the peace treaty
that morning the grand fleet left scapa flow to conduct training manoeuvres and while they were away reuter issued the order to scuttle the high seas fleet
during this period she served in the black sea during the allied intervention in the russian civil war to support the whites against the red bolsheviks
on <num> april <year> marlborough arrived in sevastopol before proceeding to yalta the following day
the ship took dowager empress maria feodorovna and other members of the russian imperial family including grand duke nicholas and prince felix yusupov aboard in yalta on the evening of the <num>
the empress refused to leave unless the british also evacuated wounded and sick soldiers along with any civilians that also wanted to escape the advancing bolsheviks
the russian entourage aboard marlborough numbered some <num> people including <num> members of the royal family and nobility with a number of governesses nurses maids and manservants plus several hundred cases of luggage
about <num> officer ’ s cabins were vacated and additional bunks were installed with the empress taking over the captain 's cabin
on the morning of <num> april the ship anchored off halki island about <num> miles <num> km from constantinople due to some uncertainty over the final destination for the russian royal family
on <num> april grand duke nicholas nikolaevich and his wife the grand duchess anastasia the grand duke peter nicholaievitch and his wife grand duchess milica princess marina prince roman count and countess tyszkiewich baron and baroness staal mr boldyreff and dr malama with their respective servants left the ship and boarded hms lord nelson destined for genoa
they were replaced by count dimitri and countess sophia mengden count george and countess irina mengden countess vera mengden count nicholas mengden madame helena erchoff and two maids
on the morning of <num> april good friday the ship sailed for malta
the ship departed on <num> april bound for malta to deposit the russians before returning to constantinople
in may <year> marlborough conducted tests with new high @-@ explosive <num> @-@ inch shells off the kerch peninsula though these proved to be unreliable
during this period she operated a kite balloon to aid in spotting the fall of shot
later that month a shell broke up in the left barrel of a turret and caused minor damage
while stationed off the kerch peninsula the ship provided artillery support to white troops including bombardments of bolshevik positions in the villages of koi @-@ asan and dal kamici
by <year> british attention had turned to the greco @-@ turkish war
on <num> june <year> marlborough arrived in constantinople where the mediterranean fleet was being concentrated to support the occupation of the city
on <num> july british forces landed at gemlik while marlborough provided artillery support
in october <year> the battleship king george v arrived to replace marlborough in the mediterranean fleet
marlborough then returned to devonport where she was paid off for a major refit that took place between february <year> and january <year>
during the refit range dials were installed along with another range @-@ finder on the rear superstructure
the aircraft platform was removed from b turret
long @-@ base range @-@ finders were installed on x turret
after completing the refit in january <year> marlborough was recommissioned and assigned to the mediterranean where she replaced emperor of india
she served as the second command flagship until october
following the treaty of lausanne in <year> the allied countries withdrew their occupation forces from turkey marlborough was involved in escorting the troop convoys out of constantinople
marlborough briefly served as the flagship for the deputy commander of the <num> battle squadron after king george v was damaged from striking a rock off mytilene
in november <year> the <num> battle squadron was renamed the <num> battle squadron
in march <year> the <num> battle squadron including marlborough was transferred to the atlantic fleet
there the battleships served as training ships
in <year> the ship 's <num> @-@ inch anti @-@ aircraft guns were replaced with more powerful <num> @-@ inch guns
in january <year> marlborough served as the squadron flagship relieving emperor of india
she remained in the position for only five months being decommissioned on <num> june
according to the terms of the london naval treaty of <year> the four ships of the iron duke class were to be scrapped or demilitarised marlborough was scheduled to be removed from service in <year> and broken up for scrap
the ship was used as a target to test the effect of various weapons on capital ships along with emperor of india
the tests included firing destroyer armament at the upper works at close range to test their effectiveness in a simulated night engagement direct hits from <num>
<num> @-@ inch shells bomb tests and experiments with flash tightness in the magazines
the first two tests were conducted in july <year> and were simulations of magazine explosions
the venting system worked as designed and while the explosions caused serious internal damage marlborough was not destroyed as the three battlecruisers had been at jutland
in <year> further tests were conducted with dummy <num> @-@ pound <num> kg and <num> @-@ pound <num> kg bombs to test deck strength <num> @-@ pound <num> kg armour @-@ piercing ap bombs and <num> @,@ <num> @-@ pound <num> kg high explosive he bombs were then detonated inside the ship to test their effectiveness
the royal navy determined that the he bombs were useless but that thick deck armour would be required to defeat ap bombs
this led to the decision to reinforce the deck armour of existing battleships throughout the <num>
marlborough was placed on the disposal list in may <year> and was quickly sold to the alloa shipbreaking co
on <num> june she arrived in rosyth where she was broken up for scrap
it was headquartered in hoeryong north korea and was also known as the <num> unit korean 766부대
trained extensively in amphibious warfare and unconventional warfare the <num> regiment was considered a special forces commando unit
the regiment was trained to conduct assaults by sea and then to lead other north korean units on offensive operations to infiltrate behind enemy lines and to disrupt enemy supplies and communications
activated in <year> the regiment trained for more than a year before the outbreak of the war on june <num> <year>
on that day half of the regiment led north korean forces against south korean troops by land and sea pushing them back after several days of fighting
over the next six weeks the regiment advanced slowly down the korean peninsula acting as a forward unit of the north korean army
suffering from a lack of supplies and mounting casualties the regiment was committed to the battle of pusan perimeter as part of a push to force united nations un troops out of korea
the regiment saw its final action at the battle of p 'ohang @-@ dong fighting unsuccessfully to take the town from u
n
troops
racked by u
n
naval and air forces and suffering extensive losses from continuous fighting the regiment was forced to retreat from the p 'ohang @-@ dong battlefield
it moved north joining a concentration of other kpa units before being disbanded and absorbed into the kpa 's <num> division
eventually it was reinforced to the size of a full regiment with <num> @,@ <num> men equally distributed across six battalions numbered 1st through <num>
it was made directly subordinate to the kpa army headquarters and put under the command of senior colonel oh jin woo who would command the unit for its entire existence
all <num> men of the <num> battalion were lost just before the war started when their transport was sunk while attacking pusan harbor by the republic of korea navy
for the remainder of its existence the regiment was whittled down by losses until it numbered no more than <num> @,@ <num> men and could not muster more than three battalions
these units subverted south korean authority before and during the war with terror campaigns sabotage and inducing rebellions in rok military units
hundreds of commandos were sent to south korea in this fashion and by the end of the war up to <num> @,@ <num> of them had been trained and armed
during this time north korean leadership also ordered the creation of large conventional units to act as advance forces for the actual invasion
the <num> unit was formed in april <year> at the third military academy in hoeryong north korea
