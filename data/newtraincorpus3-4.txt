maggie is the youngest child of marge and homer and sister to bart and lisa
she is often seen sucking on her red pacifier and when she walks she trips over her clothing and falls on her face this running gag is used much more in earlier seasons
being an infant she cannot talk
she is a counterpart to lisa simpson
however she did appear to talk in the first tracy ullman short
therefore she is the least seen and heard member of the simpson family
maggie 's squeaking and occasional speaking parts are currently provided by nancy cartwright but she has also been voiced by guest stars james earl jones elizabeth taylor and jodie foster and by series regulars yeardley smith and harry shearer
maggie has appeared in various media relating to the simpsons – including video games the simpsons movie the simpsons ride commercials and comic books – and has inspired an entire line of merchandise
in several episodes events have been linked to specific times though sometimes this timeline has been contradicted in subsequent episodes
maggie is the youngest child of marge and homer and sister to bart and lisa
when marge became pregnant with bart she and homer got married at a chapel in las vegas
to support his impending family homer all but demanded a job at the springfield nuclear power plant impressing its owner mr burns with his aggressive submissiveness
when marge became pregnant with lisa two years later she and homer bought their first house
another six years later homer felt financially secure enough to finally quit his job at the power plant and take his dream job at barney 's bowlarama
however marge became pregnant with maggie so homer once again unable to support his family was forced to reapply for his old job
by the time maggie was born homer had shown great signs of distress but he managed to find motivation in the form of his newborn baby girl
during the earlier seasons of the show maggie 's equivalent of a hallmark was to trip over her clothing and fall on her face while trying to walk causing a loud thud on the floor but this was toned down in the later seasons
she has penchant for her pacifier on which she is always seen sucking
maggie has performed a number of feats that suggest she is a baby genius
she has spelled out e mc <num> with her baby blocks driven homer 's car escaped from the springfield daycare center and written her name on an etch a sketch
maggie is keenly aware of her surroundings and can usually be seen imitating the flow of action around her
she shows a high degree of dexterity and she once hit homer on the head with a mallet and shot a dart at a photograph of him in imitation of itchy and scratchy
despite her age maggie is a formidable marksman as seen in who shot mr
burns where she shoots mr
burns with a handgun that falls into her hands and in a more intentional manner during poppa 's got a brand new badge where she is able to non @-@ fatally shoot a group of mobsters in rapid succession with a rifle that she apparently hides in her crib
maggie is usually frightened and exasperated by homer 's attempts to bond with her but has on several occasions stepped in to save homer 's life once from drowning once from being shot by mobsters once from being kidnapped by a tow truck driver and once from being shot by russ cargill head of the united states environmental protection agency

groening had been called in to pitch a series of animated shorts for the tracey ullman show and had intended to present an adaptation of his life in hell comic strip
when he realized that animating life in hell would require him to rescind publication rights for his life 's work groening decided to go in another direction and hurriedly sketched out his version of a dysfunctional family and named the characters after members of his own family
the baby of the family was named maggie after groening 's youngest sister
maggie then made her debut with the rest of the simpsons family on april <num> <year> in the short good night
in <year> the shorts were adapted into the simpsons a half @-@ hour series that would air on the fox broadcasting company
maggie and the rest of the family remained the main characters on this new show
the entire simpson family was designed so that they would be recognizable in silhouette
the family was crudely drawn because groening had submitted basic sketches to the animators assuming they would clean them up instead they just traced over his drawings
maggie 's physical features are generally not used in other characters for example in the later seasons no character other than lisa shares her hairline
while designing maggie and lisa groening couldn 't be bothered to even think about girls hair styles
at the time groening was primarily drawing in black and white and when designing lisa and maggie he just gave them this kind of spiky starfish hair style not thinking that they would eventually be drawn in color
groening thought that it would be funny to have a baby character that did not talk and never grew up but was scripted to show any emotions that the scene required
maggie 's comedic hallmarks include her tendency to stumble and land on her face while attempting to walk and a penchant for sucking on her pacifier the sound of which has become the equivalent of her catchphrase and was originally created by groening during the tracey ullman period
in the early seasons of the show maggie would suck her pacifier over other characters dialogue but this was discontinued because the producers found it too distracting
maggie 's first lines were spoken in good night the first short to air on the tracey ullman show after the family falls asleep
on this occasion liz georges provided the voice of maggie
although she had previously spoken in fantasies and dream sequences maggie 's first word spoken in the normal continuity of the series occurred in lisa 's first word when she was voiced by elizabeth taylor
although it was only one word daddy taylor had to record the part numerous times before the producers were satisfied
james earl jones voiced maggie in treehouse of horror v
maggie would later have brief dialogue in treehouse of horror ix voiced by harry shearer who used his kang voice
in earlier episodes yeardley smith did many of maggie 's squeaks cries laughs and occasional speaking parts although in the later seasons her parts are done by nancy cartwright including a single word spoken during the end credits of the simpsons movie
jodie foster voiced a howard roark @-@ inspired maggie in the season <num> episode four great women and a manicure
in the occasional simpsons in the future -themed episodes lisa 's wedding bart to the future future @-@ drama holidays of future passed days of future future although an older maggie is depicted as a running gag within these episodes she is never shown speaking so no voice actors have been utilized on these occasions
com said her favorite maggie scenes on the simpsons are the ones that show her acting more like an adult than a one @-@ year @-@ old
some of her favorite maggie scenes include scenes from sweet seymour skinner 's baadasssss song and lady bouvier 's lover where maggie meets her unibrowed archenemy baby gerald and the one scene from itchy scratchy the movie in which bart is supposed to babysit maggie but she escapes and takes homer 's car for a ride
basile also added that whether watching the happy elves or falling down maggie is the cutest baby in the simpson family
comedian ricky gervais named and maggie makes three his second favorite episode of the show and said that the scene in the end where homer puts up pictures of maggie over his desk gave him a lump in the throat thinking about it
todd everett at variety called the scene in lisa 's first word where maggie speaks her first word quite a heart @-@ melter
in <year> elizabeth taylor was named thirteenth on ign 's top <num> simpsons guest appearances list for her performance as maggie in lisa 's first word

the thief publishes many advertisements in the newspaper explaining that he will give the painting back if the community can discover which paintings under vermeer 's name were really painted by him
this causes petra calder and the rest of hyde park to examine art more closely
themes of art chance coincidence deception and problem @-@ solving are apparent
the novel was written for balliett classroom intended to deal with real @-@ world issues
balliett values children 's ideas and wrote the book specifically to highlight that
chasing vermeer has won several awards including the edgar and the agatha
in <year> the sequel entitled the wright <num> was published followed by the calder game in <year>
its original purpose was a book to read to her class for fun
she realized that a mystery about real art issues had not been written since e
l
konigsburg 's from the mixed @-@ up files of mrs
basil e
frankweiler and desired to write what she wished to read
chasing vermeer took about five years to complete as balliett was also a teacher and parent
she compared writing the book to weaving as she first wrote mainly about art but then incorporated the pentominoes and classroom scenes creating many different levels to read on
she admits that it ended up more complex than she had thought it would be
balliett used art and blank plates as inspiration for the characters names
calder pillay is derived from the artist alexander calder and petra andalee was inspired by the architecture in petra jordan
the names were meant to be different which balliett considered fun for a child
balliett felt that she could capture the attention of reluctant readers if they related to characters who enjoyed writing and math
calder and petra 's teacher ms
hussey was inspired by an old name on nantucket island and the old @-@ fashioned word hussy
balliett compares herself to ms
hussey stating that we think a lot alike
some of ms
hussey 's assignments and dialogue even came from balliett 's classroom
she chose the setting of hyde park chicago where she currently lives because she considered it full of secrets that children could discover
the letter tells them they are of great need to the sender but begs them not to tell the police
sixth @-@ graders calder pillay who enjoys puzzles and pentominoes and petra andalee who aspires to be a writer are classmates at the middle school in hyde park chicago
their young teacher ms
hussey is very interested in art and teaches them in a creative way
through her pressing questions they discover the artist johannes vermeer and his paintings especially a lady writing and the geographer
petra also finds a used book called lo written by charles fort at the local powell 's books owned by a man named mr
watch
they also meet an elderly neighbor mrs
sharpe who is also a fan of vermeer and fort
calder receives letters from his best friend tommy segovia who is currently living in new york city with a new stepfather
the children learn that a lady writing was traveling from the national gallery of art in washington d
c
to hyde park
the next day there is a story in the paper of how the painting mysteriously disappeared
a letter from the thief appears in the newspaper telling the public that he will not give back a lady writing until they prove which vermeer paintings were truly painted by him
this sparks worldwide uproar
calder and petra investigate as their friendship grows
mrs
sharpe requests police protection and it is revealed that she and ms
hussey were two of the three recipients of the thief 's letter
calder and petra eventually conclude that the painting is hidden in the local delia dell hall and they sneak out and find it
they barely escape from the thief who is later found dead from a massive heart attack on the train by the police
they learn that the man is xavier glitts also knowned as glitter man who was posing as tommy 's stepfather under the name fred steadman
a known art thief he was asked to steal the painting and sell it for sixty million dollars
the other recipient of the letter is revealed to be mr
watch
this was an idea of brett helquist and balliett 's editor tracy mack
the code involves images of pentominoes and frogs which is a recurring theme in the book
to decode the code one must count the number of frogs in every other illustration as well as find the hidden pentomino
once these facts are collected you are to use the same code presented in the story that calder and tommy use in their letters in the book
for example the first code in the book is v <num>
this means t when decoded with calder and tommy 's decoder
when the message is decoded it spells out the lady lives
scholastic 's teaching website additionally added suspense due to the surprise ending
a book by rita soltan entitled reading raps a book club guide for librarians kids and families analyzed chasing vermeer 's themes as follows deception and problem solving are central themes in this novel as both the thief and the central adult players use a variety of ways to hide the truth while the children employ a series of mathematical and problem @-@ solving concepts to piece together the clues to the puzzle
in addition calder and petra develop a special friendship and certain respect for the value of art
as the thief gains publicity by challenging the community to figure out which paintings claimed to be vermeer 's were indeed painted by him everyone starts to look at the depth in art
sondra eklund who writes a book review blog noted that the reader was left with the impression to study vermeer 's paintings and art more closely
in the book ms
hussey challenges her class to the question what is art other themes include chance and coincidence
during chasing vermeer charles fort 's book lo inspires the children to list and pay attention to coincidences as they realize that they are more than what they seem and explore the concept that they make up one unexplained pattern
balliett stated that she wanted to convey how coincidences were noticeable and felt meaningful and how they could matter even if they were unexplainable
it runs about <num> hours and <num> minutes
audiofile magazine praised reilly 's voices and pace but noted that once the mystery is solved however the ending seems tacked on falling flat
the new york times praised the description and mystery
it was also listed as one of their notable books of <year>

children 's literature reviewer claudia mills gave generally positive comments calling the novel engrossing and engaging
the website kidsreads compared the book to classic mysteries such as the westing game and said chasing vermeer deserves a spot alongside many well @-@ loved children 's books
it 's that good
a reviewer of the trades website called it an entertaining read that manages to serve several purposes in one concise novel and found the characters unusual yet likable but felt that the disappointing bit of this novel is that the solutions always arrive through a series of disconnected events that just lead the kids to think in certain ways
kadon enterprises a game puzzle company reviewed the book praising the writing style and puzzles
p
j
hogan was slated as director and the novel was adapted by matt nix
however when asked about the film in august <year> balliett answered it ’ s been fascinating watching this whole process because plan b did a wonderful job
they went through two screenwriters and they ’ ve gone through two directors
it ’ s sort of like a house of cards

despite these influences and her classical training the diverse musical styles that she has used throughout her career and sometimes in the same soundtrack include rock electronica oriental ambient industrial pop symphonic operatic chiptune and more
she draws inspiration for her songs from things in her life that move her emotionally which she describes as a beautiful picture scenery tasting something delicious scents that bring back memories happy and sad things
anything that moves my emotion gives me inspiration
shimomura has also stated that she comes up with most of her songs when she is doing something that is not part of her daily routine like traveling
although her influences are mostly classical she has said that in her opinion her style has changed dramatically over the years though the passion for music stays the same
shimomura has said that she believes that an important part of the creative process behind music is to convey a subtle message something that comes from your imagination and sticks with the listener without being overly specific about what it means rather than only writing simple themes with obvious messages
her favorite track that she has ever composed is dearly beloved from kingdom hearts

it originally aired on the fox network in the united states on march <num> <year>
in the episode lisa fears that she may be genetically predisposed to lose her intelligence after grandpa tells her of a family gene that can permanently take away intelligence
lisa the simpson was written by ned goldreyer and directed by susie dietter
this episode was the final episode with bill oakley and josh weinstein as show runners
it received generally positive reviews from critics and is considered one of the best episodes of the ninth season
following this incident lisa finds herself unable to perform simple tasks
later lisa tells grampa about her recent cognitive problems
he seems to recognize this and tells lisa about the simpson gene which apparently causes all members of the simpson family to gradually lose their intelligence as they get older
meanwhile jasper visits the kwik @-@ e @-@ mart and attempts to empty the freezer containing ice cream in order to freeze himself with the intention of being defrosted sometime in the distant future
apu decides to take advantage of this unusual situation for financial gain
the convenience store becomes more profitable as a tourist trap until the freezer 's cooling system fails causing jasper to defrost and walk away
lisa appears on the tv news program smartline to tell the citizens of springfield to treasure their brains
as she does this homer decides to prove her wrong and contacts the entire extended simpson family to visit
however when they arrive homer realizes they 're also unsuccessful unintelligent people which only depresses lisa further and causes homer to send them home
however before they leave marge urges homer to talk to the simpson women
reluctantly he talks to them at her request and he discovers that the women are all successful
lisa is relieved that she is fine and she will not suffer the simpson gene because of her gender
the episode ends with lisa finally being able to solve the brain teaser she was unable to finish earlier in the episode
the episode was written by ned goldreyer and is one of the two episodes he has written on the simpsons
susie dietter one of the directors of the show also left the show after this episode but returned for one episode in season <num> yokel chords
as it was the final episode they ran oakley and weinstein wanted to end on a good note with weinstein stating that the episode was meant to embody the humor depth and emotions of the simpsons
they also wished to have an episode they ran that was based on the background of every character they could do and believed that this episode came out well
the name of the episode was the center of an argument that oakley and goldreyer had as oakley had originally wanted to have the episode named lisa the simpson although goldreyer wanted to name it suddenly stupid a pun on a show that had been airing at the time called suddenly susan
the simpsons family members that showed up took some time to be made but the staff enjoyed the results
all of the male simpson family members that showed up were voiced by dan castellaneta the voice of homer
he had asked for the recording tape to be run for about <num> minutes so he could do many different voice variations that would fit the different men but still be close to homer 's voice
<num> equivalent to approximately <num>
<num> million viewing households
it was the second highest @-@ rated show on the fox network that week following the x @-@ files
ign 's todd gilchrist named the episode as one of his favorites of the ninth season in his review of the dvd boxset
the authors of the book i can 't believe it 's a bigger and better updated unofficial simpsons guide warren martyn and adrian wood thought well of the episode saying a terrific episode with a good mix of pathos lisa 's farewell to the springsonian and her favourite jazz club are inspired and fun her homeresque woo @-@ hoo which comes together to make a refreshing and exciting look at lisa 's life
bill oakley and josh weinstein greatly enjoyed the episode and thought of it as a great final episode that they ran
on the dvd audio commentary writer ned goldreyer stated i think this might have been the best episode ever produced
as families have evolved the practice of being a stay @-@ at @-@ home dad has become more common and socially more acceptable
pre @-@ industrialisation the family worked together as a unit and was self @-@ sufficient
beginning with the industrial revolution large @-@ scale production replaced home manufacturing this shift coupled with prevailing norms governing sex or gender roles dictated that the father become the breadwinner and the mother the caregiver
when affection @-@ based marriages emerged in the <num> parents began devoting more attention to children and family relationships became more open
beginning during world war ii many women entered the workforce out of necessity women resumed the caregiver position after the war but their new @-@ found sense of independence changed the traditional family structure together with cultural shifts leading to the feminist movement and advances in birth control
some women opted to return to the care giver role
others chose to pursue careers
when women chose to work outside of the home alternative childcare became a necessity
if childcare options were too costly unavailable or undesirable the stay @-@ at @-@ home dad became a viable option
the number of stay @-@ at @-@ home dads began gradually increasing in the late <num> century especially in developed western nations
the recent statistic that pew research released showed a report in june <year> that found <num> million men to be stay @-@ at @-@ home dads
however in <year> the number of stay @-@ at @-@ home dads had reached its highest point of <num>
<num> million
though the role is subject to many stereotypes and men may have difficulties accessing parenting benefits communities and services targeted at mothers it became more socially acceptable by the <num>
the stay @-@ at @-@ home dad was more regularly portrayed in the media by the <num> especially in the united states
however due to traditional family structures and stereotypic expectations the stay at home father figure is culturally unacceptable in countries such as east asia and india
typical families consisted of five or more children initially because of high infant mortality rates only a few children survived adolescence
colonial families existed to serve six main functions self @-@ sufficient business school vocational institute church house of correction and welfare institution
the first african @-@ americans to reach america were initially brought over as indentured servants but instead became slaves
by the <num> century slave trading was a thriving business
typical slave families consisted of one or two children
women were primarily the head of the families either because the fathers had died or had been separated from the family
african @-@ american women experienced what came to be known as the double day a full day of domestic chores plus a full day of work outside the home
as this rapid transition took place families lost many of their production functions
instead family members had to work outside the home to support their families
as a result husbands and wives began operating in separate spheres of activity
the husband became the breadwinner by going out and working while the wife stayed home and took care of the family
at the beginning of the <num> century married couples began to emphasize the importance of sexual attraction and compatibility in their relationships
this led to more intimate and open relationships along with more adolescent freedom
the transition of the family was influenced by the great depression which forced many women into the workplace in order to compensate for lack of financial stability
in <year> a federal executive order stated that only one spouse could work for the federal government
this resulted in many women being forced to resign allowing their husbands to continue working
world war ii had a significant impact on changing family roles
because of the draft workers were scarce in many industries and employers began to fill jobs with women mainly in nontraditional positions
this increase in working women became one of the few times in history where women were praised for work outside the home
divorce rates also reached a new high during this period
not only had many women found a new sense of independence but cultural shifts were underway including the rise of feminism and the development of reliable methods of birth control
such changes caused some women to decide to end their unhappy marriages
the <num> saw a baby boom in america
this period was also called the golden <num>
this was credited to families trying to make up lost time after the war
as a result many families moved to the suburbs instead of residing in the city the number of two @-@ income families began to increase and grown children began to remain at home longer because of financial difficulties
gradually women began re @-@ entering the workforce
this progression away from the traditional view of the woman as the homemaker led to the creation of the role of the stay @-@ at @-@ home dad
in developed east asian nations such as japan and south korea this practice is less common
there are several reasons why some families feel that it would be more beneficial for the father to be the primary caregiver while the mother works outside of the home
the decision to use a stay @-@ at @-@ home dad arrangement is most commonly due to economic reasons
at the same time women are progressing into higher @-@ paying jobs
there are now financial ramifications in deciding whether the mother or father should become the stay @-@ at @-@ home parent
in cases where the woman is the higher @-@ paid parent it makes more economic sense for her to continue to work while the man takes on the caregiver role
it also makes sense at times the mother 's job offers health benefits for the family whereas the father 's does not
it has also been shown that if the pregnancy was jointly planned the father is more likely to be involved
with the growth of telecommuting many men are also able to work from home
in this regard he is contributing financially to the family while also acting as the primary caregiver of the family 's children
differences in parent 's schedules can also account for some of the stay @-@ at @-@ home dads
sometimes the father works odd work shifts while the mother has a typical nine @-@ to @-@ five work schedule
fixed gender roles began to become less prominent in the western world starting in the late <num> century allowing men to make their own choice of career without regard to traditional gender @-@ based roles
some men who choose this role may do so because they enjoy being an active part of their children 's lives while in other families the mother wants to pursue her career
for example of the <num> participants at fortune magazine 's most powerful women in the business summit one third of the women 's husbands were stay @-@ at @-@ home dads
families vary widely in terms of how household chores are divided
some retired males who marry a younger woman decide to become stay @-@ at @-@ home dads while their wives work because they want a second chance to watch a child grow up in a second or third marriage
additionally more career and lifestyle options are accepted and prevalent in western society
there are also fewer restrictions on what constitutes a family
in regions where traditional roles prevail a stay @-@ at @-@ home dad might be shunned by stay @-@ at @-@ home mom 's peer group
in order to find support for their choice these men have created and joined many support networks
still many men struggle to find acceptance within the role of stay @-@ at @-@ home dad despite the many gains that have been made
many worry about losing business skills and their professional place in line
there is a common misconception that stay @-@ at @-@ home dads cannot get a job and therefore must rewrite the typical family roles forcing the wife into the workforce
carrying the financial burden and dealing with children 's attachment to the dad can be difficult on a working mother
one <year> study by the american heart association suggested stay @-@ at @-@ home dads may face a higher risk of heart disease
the reasons for the health risk are not specified
the role of stay @-@ at @-@ home dad may be difficult for men who feel as though they had no option
it is hard for these men to adapt from being a financial provider in the family to being a homemaker
men who willingly choose to become a stay @-@ at @-@ home dad are much more satisfied with their role in the family
transitioning from the workplace to stay at home role can be challenging
pay cut due to some male jobs paying higher than a female job
adapting to the workforce role from the stay at home mother role
becoming the main source of income for the family and working long hours away from home and family
will lose less time with their children and will devote <num> of their day to work force and <num> to their children
children respond differently to males and females at birth
a study conducted by dr
kyle d
pruett found that infants between <num> and <num> months respond more favorably to being picked up by their fathers
pruett also found that a father 's parenting style is beneficial for a child 's physical cognitive emotional and behavioral development
mothers reassure toddlers when they become frustrated while fathers encourage them to manage their frustration
this helps the children learn to deal with stress and frustration
a long @-@ term study pruett conducted proved that a father 's active involvement with his children from birth to adolescence promotes greater emotional balance stronger curiosity and a stronger sense of self @-@ assurance in the child
additional studies show that during the first five years of a child 's life the father 's role is more influential than the mother 's in how the child learns to manage his or her body navigate social circumstances and play
furthermore a <year> study by mcgill university found that the single most important childhood factor in developing empathy is paternal involvement in childcare
children that have a strong paternal influence have more nurturing abilities
it has been researched in the role of the father in child development that in general children with stay @-@ at @-@ home dads develop attachments at infancy
the study further concluded that fathers who spent time alone bonding with their children more than twice per week brought up the most compassionate adults
robert frank a professor of child development at oakton community college in illinois conducted a study comparing households with a stay @-@ at @-@ home dad and households with a stay @-@ at @-@ home mom
his study concluded that women were still able to form a strong bond with their children despite working full @-@ time outside of the home
also women working full @-@ time were often more engaged with their children on a day @-@ to @-@ day basis than their male counterparts
his study concluded that in a family with a stay @-@ at @-@ home dad arrangement the maternal and paternal influences are equally strong
this contrasts with the more traditional family structure where the father works outside of the home and the mother stays home with the children
in this type of arrangement the mother 's influence is extremely strong whereas the father 's is relatively insignificant
the study found that both parents play an equal role in a child 's development but the stay @-@ at @-@ home dad arrangement is the most beneficial for the child
this arrangement prevents the mother from having to deal with the stress of finding acceptable childcare checking backgrounds and paying for care
this arrangement also can help ensure that the family 's values are being upheld and instilled in the children
free from the stress of childcare the working mother is able to actively pursue their career
this allows for a more relaxed working environment for the mother and allows her to focus on her career
if the mother has a higher paying job this extra income will allow for savings to be made for the children these savings could help the mother later on pay for university for the child and or children
thus she can advance her career and provide more money for the family
it puts a sound mind for the mother knowing that the child children are at a safe place with the father having the same safety and values as the mother
of <num> dads surveyed a majority said their most important role was to show love and affection to kids
safety and protection came next followed by moral guidance taking time to play and teaching and encouraging
financial care finished last
many men are now becoming more involved in their children 's lives and because of that many men now have a better understanding of what life is like for their child growing up in modern society
because fathers are immersed in their children 's lives many of the stereotypically manly attitudes and activities historically prescribed for children may be circumscribed due to a more gender @-@ neutral parenting approach that focuses on promoting independence and emotional well being
this allows children especially male children to grow up with a greater capacity for empathy and less rigidity in attitudes pertaining to gender roles than would perhaps be the case in more traditionally @-@ structured households
in <year> <num> of fathers with children aged under <num> years were employed with <num> employed full @-@ time
because of this there are few role models or resources that can help australian fathers with the stay @-@ at @-@ home dad role
the australian bureau of statistics show that approximately <num> of two parents families with children under the age of <num> have a father who is unemployed and a mother who works full time
stay at home dads in australia have almost doubled over the past decade from <num> @,@ <num> to <num> @,@ <num> and expected to increase in the future
recent sociological studies have shown that men are dedicating more time and support to their children in comparison to the <num> century
the idea of a stay at home dad were far from mainstream however the rising demand for female work has influenced this statistic to rise
this shift increased father participation in family tasks that used to primarily be the responsibility of the mother
beginning in the late <num> century parental roles began to become less traditional and the stay @-@ at @-@ home dad arrangement began to become more common
the number of stay @-@ at @-@ home dads increased by three percent points between <year> and <year> and the average age of a stay @-@ at @-@ home dad in canada is forty @-@ two
a bill was passed in by the canadian government in october <year> which granted paid leave for fathers for the purpose of primary caregiving
however a survey conducted in <year> in japan suggested that nearly one third of married men would accept the role
the japanese government passed a law in april <year> allowing time off following the birth of a child for both male and female employees
in <year> <num>
<num> of japanese fathers took time off of work to raise children
in south korea about <num> @,@ <num> men were stay @-@ at @-@ home dads in <year>
even so stay @-@ at @-@ home dads face discrimination from stay @-@ at @-@ home mothers and are often ostracized
customs in china suggest that men must be the heads of their households
stereotyping is an issue for stay @-@ at @-@ home dads who sometimes prefer not to tell others about their family arrangement
traditional ideas promote criticism of woman @-@ like men and many feel that they would face humiliation and criticism for being stay @-@ at @-@ home dads
others suppose they would be looked at as having a wife that is too strong
however some <num> of married women of working age were allowed to stay at home as full @-@ time housewives less than some countries in the same region like south korean japan and taiwan more than soviet union mainland china or nordic countries like sweden about the same as today 's usa
in the early <num> an estimated <num> @,@ <num> @-@ <num> @,@ <num> people perished in the famine which was largely a product of the north korean government 's unwillingness to reform the economy and the old system began to fall apart
in some cases women began by selling household items they could do without or homemade food
today at least three @-@ quarters of north korean market vendors are women
a joke making the rounds in pyongyang goes what do a husband and a pet dog have in common answer neither works nor earns money but both are cute stay at home and can scare away burglars
according to one sociologist 's study in <year> as much as three percent of all urban working fathers in india are stay @-@ at @-@ home dads and twelve percent of unmarried indian men would consider being a stay @-@ at @-@ home dad according to a survey conducted by business today
one sociologist sushma tulzhapurkar called this a shift in indian society saying that a decade ago it was an unheard concept and not to mention socially unacceptable for men to give up their jobs and remain at home
however only <num>
<num> percent of indian women are part of the labor force compared to <num>
<num> percent of men thus women are more likely to be caregivers because most do not work outside the home
according to the same paper in <year> recent figures from the office for national statistics showed more than <num> @,@ <num> fathers chose to stay at home and be the primary caregiver for their children
in an interview published in the radio times in may <year> karren brady made it plain she could never be a housewife
while she maintains a business career in london her husband paul peschisolido has the role of house @-@ husband though brady collaborates in tasks at home to a certain extent
this number is less than the previous two years according to the us census bureau
in <year> stay @-@ at @-@ home dads made up approximately <num>
<num> of the nation 's stay @-@ at @-@ home parents
this is triple the percentage from <year> and has been consistently higher each year since <year>
in <year> stay @-@ at @-@ home dads were caring for approximately <num> @,@ <num> children <num> of stay @-@ at @-@ home dads had two or more children
these statistics only account for married stay @-@ at @-@ home dads there are other children being cared for by single fathers or gay couples
also it is difficult to ascertain how many of these stay @-@ at @-@ home dads have accepted the role voluntarily and how many have been forced into it by the economic crisis of the late <num> and early <num> during which a great number of mostly @-@ male blue @-@ collar industries suffered significant losses and many previously employed men entered periods of prolonged unemployment
in a career that lasted from the april <year> to october <year> he ran <num> times and won <num> races
a useful performer at two and three years old he matured into an outstanding horse in his last three seasons winning important races at distances ranging from six furlongs the july cup to two and a half miles ascot gold cup and defeating three winners of the epsom derby

as a yearling tristan was bought by the french owner c
j
lefevre who sent the colt to be trained by tom jennings at the phantom house stable at newmarket suffolk
jennings would later say that tristan had been mistreated as a yearling before his arrival at newmarket and this explained his well @-@ known temperament problems
tristan was ridden in most of his races by george fordham and came to show a strong and sometimes violent dislike for other jockeys
tristan ’ s sire hermit won the epsom derby in <year> and became an outstandingly successful stallion being champion sire for seven successive years

by this time he was being described as about the best horse of the day in england and the present champion of the english turf although he was also called a bad horse to ride
an example of tristan 's problematic behaviour came on newmarket heath that summer when he attacked a horse named gratin who was acting as his training companion

<num> km tributary of loyalsock creek in lycoming and sullivan counties in the u
s
state of pennsylvania
two unincorporated villages and a hamlet are on the creek and its watershed drains <num>
<num> square miles <num> km2 in parts of five townships
the creek is a part of the chesapeake bay drainage basin via loyalsock creek and the west branch susquehanna and susquehanna rivers
plunketts creek 's unique name comes from the first owner of the land including the creek 's mouth and the creek has given its name to two townships although one has since changed its name
the creek flows southwest and then south through the dissected allegheny plateau through rock from the mississippian sub @-@ period and devonian period
much of the plunketts creek valley is composed of various glacial deposits chiefly alluvium
although the plunketts creek watershed was clear @-@ cut and home to a tannery sawmills and a coal mine in the nineteenth century today it is heavily wooded and known for its high water quality fishing and other recreational opportunities
the watershed now includes parts of the loyalsock state forest pennsylvania state game lands and a state game farm for raising pheasant
tourism hunting and fishing have long been important in the region and its year @-@ round population is increasing much faster than that of either lycoming or sullivan county
during conflicts with native americans he treated wounded settlers and fought the natives
plunkett led a pennsylvania expedition in the pennamite @-@ yankee war to forcibly remove settlers from connecticut who had claimed and settled on lands also claimed by pennsylvania
for his services plunkett was granted six tracts of land totaling <num> @,@ <num> acres <num>
<num> km2 on november <num> <year> although the land was not actually surveyed until september <year>
plunkett 's land included the creek 's mouth so plunketts creek was given his name
during the american revolution plunkett did not actively support the revolution and thus was suspected of being sympathetic to the british empire

lycoming county was formed from northumberland county in <year>
when plunketts creek township was formed in lycoming county in <year> the original name proposed was plunkett township but the lingering suspicions of his british sympathies led to that name being rejected
naming the township for the creek was an acceptable compromise
plunketts creek township was originally much larger than it is now and two other townships were formed from parts of it
when sullivan county was formed from lycoming county on march <num> <year> plunketts creek township was divided between the counties with each having a township of the same name
this led to some confusion and in <year> the citizens of sullivan county petitioned the state legislature to change the name of their plunketts creek township to hillsgrove township for hillsgrove the main village and post office in the township
in <year> cascade township was formed from parts of hepburn and plunketts creek townships in lycoming county
according to meginness <year> colonel plunkett actually spelled his last name plunket but the current spelling was established by custom and the courts
as of <year> it is the only stream officially named plunketts creek on usgs maps of the united states and in the usgs geographic names information system

the possessive apostrophe is not part of the official name of the creek although records from the <num> century often spell it as plunkett 's creek
the native american name for plunketts creek is unknown
two streams in the watershed have given their names to roads in plunketts creek township engle run drive and mock run road
the source is a pond just north of pennsylvania route <num> the road between the villages of proctor and hillsgrove and plunketts creek crosses the road twice then receives two unnamed tributaries on the right bank as it flows generally southwest about <num>

its water level is typically highest perhaps <num> feet <num> m deep in spring or for a few days after a heavy rain and lowest in late summer when it can shrink to a trickle
while there is no stream gauge on plunketts creek a rough estimate of the creek 's water level may be found from the stream gauge on the loyalsock creek bridge in barbours just downstream of the mouth
lycoming county operates this gauge as part of the county @-@ wide flood warning system
it only measures the water height not discharge and measured a record gauge height of <num>

the september <year> flood was caused by remnants of tropical storm lee which dumped <num>
<num> inches <num> mm of rainfall in the nearby village of shunk in fox township in sullivan county just north of the creek 's source
the <year> flooding caused widespread damage in proctor and barbours and destroyed a small stone bridge on wallis run road in proctor over king run a tributary of plunketts creek
the barbours fire hall became an emergency relief center offering food shelter and supplies to victims of the flood
further downstream on the loyalsock the flooding badly damaged the historic hillsgrove covered bridge washed out sections of pennsylvania route <num> along the creek and destroyed the pennsylvania route <num> and lycoming valley railroad bridges over the creek near and in montoursville
the previous record flood reached <num>
<num> feet <num>

the pennsylvania bureau of topographic and geologic survey 's distribution of pennsylvania coals map shows no major deposits of coal in the plunketts creek watershed and only one deposit nearby in the loyalsock creek watershed in southern plunketts creek township
however meginness <year> refers to coal mines in plunketts creek township and there is an unnamed tributary of plunketts creek in coal mine hollow on the right bank between dry run and king run so it seems a small coal mine operated there in the past
much of the plunketts creek valley and those of its tributaries is composed of various glacial deposits
closer to the mouth there are large deposits of alluvium as well as alluvial fan and alluvial terraces
many of the glacial deposits are associated with the wisconsin glaciation with stratified drift and till as well as outwash present
the alluvium is <num> feet <num> m or more thick in the lower reaches of the plunketts creek valley but only <num> feet <num> m thick in headward tributary valleys

polluting industries on the creek and its tributaries then included a coal mine and tannery which are long since departed
in the autumn of <year> three men working with hides at the proctor tannery were stricken with anthrax two fatally
another four deaths originally blamed on pneumonia were suspected of being due to pulmonary anthrax and some cattle drinking from plunketts creek downstream from the tannery were also infected
as late as <year> the sludge pile from the tannery was still visible in proctor but was not disturbed for fear of anthrax spores
no acid mine drainage is reported in the watershed
as of <year> the mean annual precipitation for the loyalsock creek watershed which plunketts creek is part of was <num> to <num> inches <num> to <num> mm
pennsylvania receives the greatest amount of acid rain of any state in the united states
because plunketts creek is in a sandstone and shale mountain region it has a relatively low capacity to neutralize added acid
this makes it especially vulnerable to increased acidification from acid rain which poses a threat to the long term health of the plants and animals in the creek
the total alkalinity ta is a measure of the capacity of water to neutralize acid with a larger ta corresponding to a greater capacity

documentary evidence names berhtwald as abbot at reculver before his election as archbishop
berhtwald begins the first continuous series of native @-@ born archbishops of canterbury although there had been previous anglo @-@ saxon archbishops they had not succeeded each other until berhtwald 's reign
berhtwald 's period as archbishop coincided with the end of wilfrid 's long struggle to regain the bishopric of york and the two @-@ year delay between theodore 's death and berhtwald 's election may have been due to efforts to select wilfrid for canterbury
after his election berhtwald went to gaul for consecration and then presided over two councils that attempted to settle the wilfrid issue finally succeeding at the second council in <num>
berhtwald also was the recipient of the first surviving letter close in western europe
by <num> he was made abbot of the monastery at reculver in kent and a charter dated may <num> names berhtwald as abbot
this charter from hlothere king of kent is the earliest surviving original anglo @-@ saxon charter
the long vacancy resulted from the disturbed conditions in the kingdom of kent at the time as various kings fought for control
the succession to the kingdom was disputed between rival claimants oswine and wihtred and various outside kings including caedwalla and swaefheard raided and plundered kent
eventually wihtred secured the throne around <num> or early <num> as bede names wihtred as king of kent along with swaefheard at the time of berhtwald 's election
swaerfheard however is not named as king of kent after this date
the vacancy may also have occurred because wilfrid who was at that point having problems in northumbria desired to become archbishop of canterbury
a contemporary biographer of wilfrid stephen of ripon says that theodore had wished for wilfrid to succeed theodore at canterbury
æthelred of mercia may have supported wilfrid 's translation to canterbury also but despite these desires the translation did not happen
berhtwald was consecrated on <num> june <num> having travelled to france for his consecration as archbishop of canterbury by godwin archbishop of lyon
berhtwald went to the continent for consecration probably because he feared that his election was not supported by all of the kings and bishops
after his consecration berhtwald travelled to rome to obtain the support of pope sergius i who wrote to a number of anglo @-@ saxon kings and bishops in support of the archbishop
two of these letters survive and their authenticity has been doubted mainly because they are only preserved as part of the post @-@ norman conquest canterbury @-@ york dispute
historians have since come to regard the two letters as genuine
sergius also gave berhtwald a pallium the symbol of an archbishop 's authority
he also consecrated the first bishop of selsey
during his time in office king wihtred of kent in the law of wihtred exempted the church from taxation
berhtwald was a proponent of his predecessor 's view of the archbishops of canterbury as primates of the entire island of britain
berhtwald co @-@ operated closely with wihtred in the kingdom and secured the exemption of the church from taxation under wihtred 's laws issued in <num>
the law code also dealt with other ecclesiastical matters including marriage sunday observance and pagan worship
this law code resulted from a royal council that was held at bearsted
further privileges for the church were issued in <num> and may have been composed by berhtwald before being promulgated
another privilege usually referred to as the privilege of wihtred is claimed to be a grant from wihtred to the monasteries of kent of exemption from non @-@ clerical control
however this is actually a ninth @-@ century forgery
much of berhtwald 's time in office coincided with the efforts of wilfrid to regain the see of york and to reverse the division of york into smaller dioceses
berhtwald was opposed to wilfrid 's desire to restore some separated bishoprics to the bishopric of york as well as regaining his old see
wilfrid 's problems had begun during the archbishopric of berhtwald 's predecessor theodore of tarsus when wilfrid had quarreled with the king of northumbria ecgfrith and was expelled from the north
theodore had taken the opportunity to divide the large see of york into a number of smaller dioceses and wilfrid had appealed to the papacy in rome
berhtwald inherited the dispute and presided at the council of austerfield in <num> at which wilfrid 's biographer relates the story that king aldfrith of northumbria berhtwald and the other enemies of wilfrid conspired to deprive wilfrid of all his offices and possessions
a more likely story is that berhtwald managed to secure concessions from the northumbrians and tried to broker a compromise
the offer in the end was that wilfrid would retire to ripon and cease acting as a bishop
wilfrid rejected this compromise and once more appealed to the pope
three years later at a further council it was arranged that wilfrid should receive the bishopric of hexham in place of that of york
this was the council of nidd usually dated to <num> and it was held in northumbria
bede also mentions that berhtwald consecrated a number of bishops including tobias as bishop of rochester
one of berhtwald 's letters has been preserved sent to forthhere bishop of sherborne and asking forthhere to intercede with beorwold the abbot of glastonbury to ransom a slave
another letter this one addressed to berhtwald from waldhere bishop of london also survives
the main interest in the second letter is that it is the oldest surviving letter close surviving in western europe
this second letter also relates that waldhere and berhtwald had attended a synod which can be dated to sometime between <num> and <num> where the kingdom of wessex was threatened with excommunication
a charter witnessed by berhtwald which mentions a supposed <num> council numbered <num> by sawyer is now known to be a fake although the witness list may be based on a legitimate <num> century charter that no longer survives
likewise a charter with berhtwald as a witness and relating to the <num> council of clofesho is also known to be a <num> @-@ century forgery although again it may have been based on actual documents from the council
an epitaph to him in verse survives and may have been placed over his tomb which was at canterbury
subsequently he was canonised with a feast day of <num> january
little evidence of extensive cult activity exists however and the main evidence for his sainthood is a late medieval entry in a st augustine 's calendar
berhtwald is the first of the continuous series of native @-@ born archbishops in england although there had been two previous anglo @-@ saxon archbishops at canterbury — deusdedit and wighard
it is a colorless dense odorless noble gas that occurs in the earth 's atmosphere in trace amounts
although generally unreactive xenon can undergo a few chemical reactions such as the formation of xenon hexafluoroplatinate the first noble gas compound to be synthesized
xenon is used in flash lamps and arc lamps and as a general anesthetic
the first excimer laser design used a xenon dimer molecule xe2 as its lasing medium and the earliest laser designs used xenon flash lamps as pumps
xenon is also being used to search for hypothetical weakly interacting massive particles and as the propellant for ion thrusters in spacecraft
naturally occurring xenon consists of eight stable isotopes
there are also over <num> unstable isotopes that undergo radioactive decay
the isotope ratios of xenon are an important tool for studying the early history of the solar system
radioactive xenon @-@ <num> is produced by beta decay from iodine @-@ <num> which is a product of nuclear fission and it acts as the most significant neutron absorber in nuclear reactors
they found xenon in the residue left over from evaporating components of liquid air
ramsay suggested the name xenon for this gas from the greek word ξένον xenon neuter singular form of ξένος xenos meaning foreign er strange r or guest
in <year> ramsay estimated the proportion of xenon in the earth 's atmosphere as one part in <num> million
during the <num> american engineer harold edgerton began exploring strobe light technology for high speed photography
this led him to the invention of the xenon flash lamp in which light is generated by sending a brief electric current through a tube filled with xenon gas
in <year> edgerton was able to generate flashes as brief as one microsecond with this method
in <year> american physician albert r
behnke jr
began exploring the causes of drunkenness in deep @-@ sea divers
he tested the effects of varying the breathing mixtures on his subjects and discovered that this caused the divers to perceive a change in depth
from his results he deduced that xenon gas could serve as an anesthetic
although russian toxicologist nikolay v
lazarev apparently studied xenon anesthesia in <year> the first published report confirming xenon anesthesia was in <year> by american medical researcher john h
lawrence who experimented on mice
xenon was first used as a surgical anesthetic in <year> by american anesthesiologist stuart c
cullen who successfully operated on two patients
xenon and the other noble gases were for a long time considered to be completely chemically inert and not able to form compounds
however while teaching at the university of british columbia neil bartlett discovered that the gas platinum hexafluoride ptf6 was a powerful oxidizing agent that could oxidize oxygen gas o2 to form dioxygenyl hexafluoroplatinate o2 ptf6 −
since o2 and xenon have almost the same first ionization potential bartlett realized that platinum hexafluoride might also be able to oxidize xenon
on march <num> <year> he mixed the two gases and produced the first known compound of a noble gas xenon hexafluoroplatinate
bartlett thought its composition to be xe ptf6 − although later work has revealed that it was probably a mixture of various xenon @-@ containing salts
since then many other xenon compounds have been discovered along with some compounds of the noble gases argon krypton and radon including argon fluorohydride harf krypton difluoride krf2 and radon fluoride
by <year> more than <num> xenon compounds were known
in november <year> ibm scientists demonstrated a technology capable of manipulating individual atoms
the program called ibm in atoms used a scanning tunneling microscope to arrange <num> individual xenon atoms on a substrate of chilled crystal of nickel to spell out the three letter company acronym
it was the first time atoms had been precisely positioned on a flat surface
at standard temperature and pressure pure xenon gas has a density of <num>
<num> kg <num> about <num>
<num> times the surface density of the earth 's atmosphere <num>
<num> kg <num>
as a liquid xenon has a density of up to <num>
<num> g ml with the density maximum occurring at the triple point
notably liquid xenon has a high polarizability due to its large atomic volume and thus is an excellent solvent
it can dissolve hydrocarbons biological molecules and even water
under the same conditions the density of solid xenon <num>
<num> g cm3 is higher than the average density of granite <num>
<num> g cm3
using gigapascals of pressure xenon has been forced into a metallic phase
solid xenon changes from face @-@ centered cubic fcc to hexagonal close packed hcp crystal phase under pressure and begins to turn metallic at about <num> gpa with no noticeable volume change in the hcp phase
it is completely metallic at <num> gpa
when metallized xenon looks sky blue because it absorbs red light and transmits other visible frequencies
such behavior is unusual for a metal and is explained by the relatively small widths of the electron bands in metallic xenon
liquid or solid xenon nanoparticles can be formed at room temperature by implanting xe ions into a solid matrix
many solids have lattice constants smaller than solid xe
this results in compression of the implanted xe to pressures that may be sufficient for its liquefaction or solidification
xenon is a member of the zero @-@ valence elements that are called noble or inert gases
it is inert to most common chemical reactions such as combustion for example because the outer valence shell contains eight electrons
this produces a stable minimum energy configuration in which the outer electrons are tightly bound
in a gas @-@ filled tube xenon emits a blue or lavenderish glow when the gas is excited by electrical discharge
xenon emits a band of emission lines that span the visual spectrum but the most intense lines occur in the region of blue light which produces the coloration
<num> million and is also found as a component in gases emitted from some mineral springs
xenon is obtained commercially as a by @-@ product of the separation of air into oxygen and nitrogen
after this separation generally performed by fractional distillation in a double @-@ column plant the liquid oxygen produced will contain small quantities of krypton and xenon
by additional fractional distillation steps the liquid oxygen may be enriched to contain <num>
<num> – <num>
<num> of a krypton xenon mixture which is extracted either via absorption onto silica gel or by distillation
finally the krypton xenon mixture may be separated into krypton and xenon via distillation
worldwide production of xenon in <year> was estimated at <num> @,@ <num> – <num> @,@ <num> <num>
because of its low abundance xenon is much more expensive than the lighter noble gases — approximate prices for the purchase of small quantities in europe in <year> were <num> € l for xenon <num> € l for krypton and <num>
<num> € l for neon the much more plentiful argon costs less than a cent per liter
within the solar system the nucleon fraction of xenon is <num>
<num> × <num> − <num> for an abundance of approximately one part in <num> thousand of the total mass
xenon is relatively rare in the sun 's atmosphere on earth and in asteroids and comets
the planet jupiter has an unusually high abundance of xenon in its atmosphere about <num>
<num> times as much as the sun
this high abundance remains unexplained and may have been caused by an early and rapid buildup of planetesimals — small subplanetary bodies — before the presolar disk began to heat up
otherwise xenon would not have been trapped in the planetesimal ices
the problem of the low terrestrial xenon may potentially be explained by covalent bonding of xenon to oxygen within quartz hence reducing the outgassing of xenon into the atmosphere
unlike the lower mass noble gases the normal stellar nucleosynthesis process inside a star does not form xenon
elements more massive than iron @-@ <num> have a net energy cost to produce through fusion so there is no energy gain for a star when creating xenon
instead xenon is formed during supernova explosions by the slow neutron capture process s @-@ process of red giant stars that have exhausted the hydrogen at their cores and entered the asymptotic giant branch in classical nova explosions and from the radioactive decay of elements such as iodine uranium and plutonium
xenon and tin are the only elements to have more than seven stable isotopes
the isotopes 124xe and 134xe are predicted to undergo double beta decay but this has never been observed so they are considered to be stable
besides these stable forms there are over <num> unstable isotopes that have been studied
the longest lived of these isotopes is 136xe which has been observed to undergo double beta decay with a half @-@ life of <num>
<num> × <num> yr
129xe is produced by beta decay of 129i which has a half @-@ life of <num> million years while 131mxe 133xe 133mxe and 135xe are some of the fission products of both 235u and 239pu and therefore used as indicators of nuclear explosions
nuclei of two of the stable isotopes of xenon 129xe and 131xe have non @-@ zero intrinsic angular momenta nuclear spins suitable for nuclear magnetic resonance
the nuclear spins can be aligned beyond ordinary polarization levels by means of circularly polarized light and rubidium vapor
the resulting spin polarization of xenon nuclei can surpass <num> of its maximum possible value greatly exceeding the thermal equilibrium value dictated by paramagnetic statistics typically <num>
<num> of the maximum value at room temperature even in the strongest magnets
such non @-@ equilibrium alignment of spins is a temporary condition and is called hyperpolarization
the process of hyperpolarizing the xenon is called optical pumping although the process is different from pumping a laser
because a 129xe nucleus has a spin of <num> <num> and therefore a zero electric quadrupole moment the 129xe nucleus does not experience any quadrupolar interactions during collisions with other atoms and thus its hyperpolarization can be maintained for long periods of time even after the laser beam has been turned off and the alkali vapor removed by condensation on a room @-@ temperature surface
spin polarization of 129xe can persist from several seconds for xenon atoms dissolved in blood to several hours in the gas phase and several days in deeply frozen solid xenon
in contrast 131xe has a nuclear spin value of <num> ⁄ <num> and a nonzero quadrupole moment and has t1 relaxation times in the millisecond and second ranges
some radioactive isotopes of xenon for example 133xe and 135xe are produced by neutron irradiation of fissionable material within nuclear reactors
135xe is of considerable significance in the operation of nuclear fission reactors
135xe has a huge cross section for thermal neutrons <num>
<num> × <num> barns so it acts as a neutron absorber or poison that can slow or stop the chain reaction after a period of operation
this was discovered in the earliest nuclear reactors built by the american manhattan project for plutonium production
fortunately the designers had made provisions in the design to increase the reactor 's reactivity the number of neutrons per fission that go on to fission other atoms of nuclear fuel
135xe reactor poisoning played a major role in the chernobyl disaster
a shutdown or decrease of power of a reactor can result in buildup of 135xe and getting the reactor into the iodine pit
under adverse conditions relatively high concentrations of radioactive xenon isotopes may be found emanating from nuclear reactors due to the release of fission products from cracked fuel rods or fissioning of uranium in cooling water
because xenon is a tracer for two parent isotopes xenon isotope ratios in meteorites are a powerful tool for studying the formation of the solar system
the iodine @-@ xenon method of dating gives the time elapsed between nucleosynthesis and the condensation of a solid object from the solar nebula
in <year> physicist john h
reynolds discovered that certain meteorites contained an isotopic anomaly in the form of an overabundance of xenon @-@ <num>
he inferred that this was a decay product of radioactive iodine @-@ <num>
this isotope is produced slowly by cosmic ray spallation and nuclear fission but is produced in quantity only in supernova explosions
as the half @-@ life of 129i is comparatively short on a cosmological time scale only <num> million years this demonstrated that only a short time had passed between the supernova and the time the meteorites had solidified and trapped the 129i
these two events supernova and solidification of gas cloud were inferred to have happened during the early history of the solar system as the 129i isotope was likely generated before the solar system was formed but not long before and seeded the solar gas cloud with isotopes from a second source
this supernova source may also have caused collapse of the solar gas cloud
in a similar way xenon isotopic ratios such as 129xe 130xe and 136xe 130xe are also a powerful tool for understanding planetary differentiation and early outgassing
for example the atmosphere of mars shows a xenon abundance similar to that of earth <num>
<num> parts per million however mars shows a higher proportion of 129xe than the earth or the sun
as this isotope is generated by radioactive decay the result may indicate that mars lost most of its primordial atmosphere possibly within the first <num> million years after the planet was formed
in another example excess 129xe found in carbon dioxide well gases from new mexico was believed to be from the decay of mantle @-@ derived gases soon after earth 's formation
almost all known xenon compounds contain the electronegative atoms fluorine or oxygen
xef is theorized to be unstable
the fluorides are the starting point for the synthesis of almost all xenon compounds
the solid crystalline difluoride xef <num> is formed when a mixture of fluorine and xenon gases is exposed to ultraviolet light
ordinary daylight is sufficient
long @-@ term heating of xef <num> at high temperatures under an nif <num> catalyst yields xef <num>
pyrolysis of xef <num> in the presence of naf yields high @-@ purity xef <num>
the xenon fluorides behave as both fluoride acceptors and fluoride donors forming salts that contain such cations as xef and xe 2f <num> and anions such as xef − <num> xef − <num> and xef2 − <num>
the green paramagnetic xe <num> is formed by the reduction of xef <num> by xenon gas
xef <num> is also able to form coordination complexes with transition metal ions
over <num> such complexes have been synthesized and characterized
whereas the xenon fluorides are well @-@ characterized the other halides are not known the only exception being the dichloride xecl2
xenon dichloride is reported to be an endothermic colorless crystalline compound that decomposes into the elements at <num> ° c formed by the high @-@ frequency irradiation of a mixture of xenon fluorine and silicon or carbon tetrachloride
however doubt has been raised as to whether xecl <num> is a real compound and not merely a van der waals molecule consisting of weakly bound xe atoms and cl <num> molecules
theoretical calculations indicate that the linear molecule xecl <num> is less stable than the van der waals complex
xeo2 forms when xenon tetrafluoride is poured over ice
its crystal structure may allow it to replace silicon in silicate minerals
the xeoo cation has been identified by infrared spectroscopy in solid argon
xenon does not react with oxygen directly the trioxide is formed by the hydrolysis of xef <num> xef <num> <num> h 2o → xeo <num> <num> hf xeo <num> is weakly acidic dissolving in alkali to form unstable xenate salts containing the hxeo − <num> anion
these unstable salts easily disproportionate into xenon gas and perxenate salts containing the xeo4 − <num> anion
barium perxenate when treated with concentrated sulfuric acid yields gaseous xenon tetroxide ba 2xeo <num> <num> h 2so <num> → <num> baso <num> <num> h 2o xeo <num> to prevent decomposition the xenon tetroxide thus formed is quickly cooled to form a pale @-@ yellow solid
it explodes above − <num>
<num> ° c into xenon and oxygen gas
a number of xenon oxyfluorides are known including xeof <num> xeof <num> xeo 2f <num> and xeo 3f <num>
xeof <num> is formed by the reaction of of <num> with xenon gas at low temperatures
it may also be obtained by the partial hydrolysis of xef <num>
it disproportionates at − <num> ° c into xef <num> and xeo 2f <num>
xeof <num> is formed by the partial hydrolysis of xef <num> or the reaction of xef <num> with sodium perxenate na 4xeo <num>
the latter reaction also produces a small amount of xeo 3f <num>
xeof <num> reacts with csf to form the xeof − <num> anion while xeof3 reacts with the alkali metal fluorides kf rbf and csf to form the xeof − <num> anion
electron @-@ withdrawing groups such as groups with fluorine substitution are necessary to stabilize these compounds
numerous such compounds have been characterized including c 6f <num> – xe – n ≡ c – ch <num> where c6f5 is the pentafluorophenyl group
c 6f <num> 2xe c 6f <num> – xe – x where x is cn f or cl
r – c ≡ c – xe where r is c 2f − <num> or tert @-@ butyl
c 6f <num> – xef <num> c 6f 5xe 2cl other compounds containing xenon bonded to a less electronegative element include f – xe – n so 2f <num> and f – xe – bf <num>
the latter is synthesized from dioxygenyl tetrafluoroborate o 2bf <num> at − <num> ° c
an unusual ion containing xenon is the tetraxenonogold ii cation auxe2 <num> which contains xe – au bonds
this ion occurs in the compound auxe <num> sb 2f <num> <num> and is remarkable in having direct chemical bonds between two notoriously unreactive atoms xenon and gold with xenon acting as a transition metal ligand

in <year> m
räsänen and co @-@ workers scientists at the university of helsinki in finland announced the preparation of xenon dihydride hxeh and later xenon hydride @-@ hydroxide hxeoh hydroxenoacetylene hxecch and other xe @-@ containing molecules
in <year> khriachtchev et al
reported the preparation of hxeoxeh by the photolysis of water within a cryogenic xenon matrix
deuterated molecules hxeod and dxeoh have also been produced
one example is xenon hydrate xe • <num>
<num> h2o where xenon atoms occupy vacancies in a lattice of water molecules
this clathrate has a melting point of <num> ° c
the deuterated version of this hydrate has also been produced
another example is xe hydride xe h2 <num> in which xenon pairs dimers are trapped inside solid hydrogen
such clathrate hydrates can occur naturally under conditions of high pressure such as in lake vostok underneath the antarctic ice sheet
clathrate formation can be used to fractionally distill xenon argon and krypton
xenon can also form endohedral fullerene compounds where a xenon atom is trapped inside a fullerene molecule
the xenon atom trapped in the fullerene can be monitored via 129xe nuclear magnetic resonance nmr spectroscopy
using this technique chemical reactions on the fullerene molecule can be analyzed due to the sensitivity of the chemical shift of the xenon atom to its environment
however the xenon atom also has an electronic influence on the reactivity of the fullerene
when xenon atoms are at their ground energy state they repel each other and will not form a bond
when xenon atoms becomes energized however they can form an excimer excited dimer until the electrons return to the ground state
this entity is formed because the xenon atom tends to fill its outermost electronic shell and can briefly do this by adding an electron from a neighboring xenon atom
the typical lifetime of a xenon excimer is <num> – <num> ns and the decay releases photons with wavelengths of about <num> and <num> nm
xenon can also form excimers with other elements such as the halogens bromine chlorine and fluorine
the first solid @-@ state laser invented in <year> was pumped by a xenon flash lamp and lasers used to power inertial confinement fusion are also pumped by xenon flash lamps
continuous short @-@ arc high pressure xenon arc lamps have a color temperature closely approximating noon sunlight and are used in solar simulators
that is the chromaticity of these lamps closely approximates a heated black body radiator that has a temperature close to that observed from the sun
after they were first introduced during the <num> these lamps began replacing the shorter @-@ lived carbon arc lamps in movie projectors
they are employed in typical <num> imax and the new digital projectors film projection systems automotive hid headlights high @-@ end tactical flashlights and other specialized uses
these arc lamps are an excellent source of short wavelength ultraviolet radiation and they have intense emissions in the near infrared which is used in some night vision systems
the individual cells in a plasma display use a mixture of xenon and neon that is converted into a plasma using electrodes
the interaction of this plasma with the electrodes generates ultraviolet photons which then excite the phosphor coating on the front of the display
xenon is used as a starter gas in high pressure sodium lamps
it has the lowest thermal conductivity and lowest ionization potential of all the non @-@ radioactive noble gases
as a noble gas it does not interfere with the chemical reactions occurring in the operating lamp
the low thermal conductivity minimizes thermal losses in the lamp while in the operating state and the low ionization potential causes the breakdown voltage of the gas to be relatively low in the cold state which allows the lamp to be more easily started
the first excimer laser used a xenon dimer xe2 energized by a beam of electrons to produce stimulated emission at an ultraviolet wavelength of <num> nm
xenon chloride and xenon fluoride have also been used in excimer or more accurately exciplex lasers
the xenon chloride excimer laser has been employed for example in certain dermatological uses
although it is expensive anesthesia machines that can deliver xenon are about to appear on the european market because advances in recovery and recycling of xenon have made it economically viable
xenon interacts with many different receptors and ion channels and like many theoretically multi @-@ modal inhalation anesthetics these interactions are likely complementary
xenon is a high @-@ affinity glycine @-@ site nmda receptor antagonist
however xenon distinguishes itself from other clinically used nmda receptor antagonists in its lack of neurotoxicity and its ability to inhibit the neurotoxicity of ketamine and nitrous oxide
unlike ketamine and nitrous oxide xenon does not stimulate a dopamine efflux in the nucleus accumbens
like nitrous oxide and cyclopropane xenon activates the two @-@ pore domain potassium channel trek @-@ <num>
a related channel task @-@ <num> also implicated in inhalational anesthetic actions is insensitive to xenon
xenon inhibits nicotinic acetylcholine α4β2 receptors which contribute to spinally mediated analgesia
xenon is an effective inhibitor of plasma membrane ca2 atpase
xenon inhibits ca2 atpase by binding to a hydrophobic pore within the enzyme and preventing the enzyme from assuming active conformations
xenon is a competitive inhibitor of the serotonin <num> @-@ ht3 receptor
while neither anesthetic nor antinociceptive this activity reduces anesthesia @-@ emergent nausea and vomiting
xenon has a minimum alveolar concentration mac of <num> at age <num> making it <num> more potent than n2o as an anesthetic
thus it can be used in concentrations with oxygen that have a lower risk of hypoxia
unlike nitrous oxide n2o xenon is not a greenhouse gas and so it is also viewed as environmentally friendly
xenon vented into the atmosphere is being returned to its original source so no environmental impact is likely
through its influence on ca2 k katp hif and nmda antagonism xenon is neuroprotective when administered before during and after ischemic insults
xenon is a high affinity antagonist at the nmda receptor glycine site
xenon is cardioprotective in ischemia @-@ reperfusion conditions by inducing pharmacologic non @-@ ischemic preconditioning
xenon is cardioprotective by activating pkc @-@ epsilon downstream p38 @-@ mapk
xenon mimics neuronal ischemic preconditioning by activating atp sensitive potassium channels
xenon allosterically reduces atp mediated channel activation inhibition independently of the sulfonylurea receptor1 subunit increasing katp open @-@ channel time and frequency
xenon upregulates hypoxia inducible factor <num> alpha hif1a
xenon gas was added as an ingredient of the ventilation mix for a newborn baby at st
michael 's hospital bristol england whose life chances were otherwise very compromised and was successful leading to the authorisation of clinical trials for similar cases
the treatment is done simultaneously with cooling the body temperature to <num>
<num> ° c
the latter hormone is known to increase red blood cell production and athletes performance
xenon inhalation has been used for this purpose in russia since at least <year>
on august <num> <year> the world anti doping agency wada added xenon and argon to the list of prohibited substances and methods although at this time there is no reliable drug test
133xe has also been used to measure blood flow
xenon particularly hyperpolarized 129xe is a useful contrast agent for magnetic resonance imaging mri
in the gas phase it can be used to image empty space such as cavities in a porous sample or alveoli in lungs
hyperpolarization renders 129xe much more detectable via magnetic resonance imaging and has been used for studies of the lungs and other tissues
it can be used for example to trace the flow of gases within the lungs
because xenon is soluble in water and also in hydrophobic solvents it can be used to image various soft living tissues
for instance xenon dissolved in water xenon dissolved in hydrophobic solvent and xenon associated with certain proteins can be distinguished by nmr
hyperpolarized xenon can be used by surface chemists
normally it is difficult to characterize surfaces using nmr because signals from the surface of a sample will be overwhelmed by signals from the far @-@ more @-@ numerous atomic nuclei in the bulk
however nuclear spins on solid surfaces can be selectively polarized by transferring spin polarization to them from hyperpolarized xenon gas
this makes the surface signals strong enough to measure and distinguishes them from bulk signals
a by @-@ product of nuclear weapon testing is the release of radioactive xenon @-@ <num> and xenon @-@ <num>
the detection of these isotopes is used to monitor compliance with nuclear test ban treaties as well as to confirm nuclear test explosions by states such as north korea
liquid xenon is being used in calorimeters for measurements of gamma rays as well as a medium for detecting hypothetical weakly interacting massive particles or wimps
when a wimp collides with a xenon nucleus it is predicted to impart enough energy to cause ionization and scintillation
liquid xenon is useful for this type of experiment due to its high density which makes dark matter interaction more likely and permits a quiet detector due to self @-@ shielding
xenon is the preferred propellant for ion propulsion of spacecraft because of its low ionization potential per atomic weight and its ability to be stored as a liquid at near room temperature under high pressure yet be easily converted back into a gas to feed the engine
the inert nature of xenon makes it environmentally friendly and less corrosive to an ion engine than other fuels such as mercury or caesium
xenon was first used for satellite ion engines during the <num>
it was later employed as a propellant for jpl 's deep space <num> probe europe 's smart @-@ <num> spacecraft and for the three ion propulsion engines on nasa 's dawn spacecraft
chemically the perxenate compounds are used as oxidizing agents in analytical chemistry
xenon difluoride is used as an etchant for silicon particularly in the production of microelectromechanical systems mems
the anticancer drug <num> @-@ fluorouracil can be produced by reacting xenon difluoride with uracil
xenon is also used in protein crystallography
applied at pressures from <num>
<num> to <num> mpa <num> to <num> atm to a protein crystal xenon atoms bind in predominantly hydrophobic cavities often creating a high @-@ quality isomorphous heavy @-@ atom derivative which can be used for solving the phase problem
xenon gas can be safely kept in normal sealed glass or metal containers at standard temperature and pressure
however it readily dissolves in most plastics and rubber and will gradually escape from a container sealed with such materials
xenon is non @-@ toxic although it does dissolve in blood and belongs to a select group of substances that penetrate the blood – brain barrier causing mild to full surgical anesthesia when inhaled in high concentrations with oxygen
at <num> m s the speed of sound in xenon gas is lower than that in air due to the lower average speed of the heavy xenon atoms compared to nitrogen and oxygen molecules
hence xenon lowers the rate of vibration in the vocal tract when exhaled
this produces a characteristic lowered voice timbre an effect opposite to the high @-@ timbred voice caused by inhalation of helium
like helium xenon does not satisfy the body 's need for oxygen
xenon is both a simple asphyxiant and an anesthetic more powerful than nitrous oxide consequently many universities no longer allow the voice stunt as a general chemistry demonstration
as xenon is expensive the gas sulfur hexafluoride which is similar to xenon in molecular weight <num> versus <num> is generally used in this stunt and is an asphyxiant without being anesthetic
it is possible to safely breathe dense gases such as xenon or sulfur hexafluoride when they are in a mixture of at least <num> oxygen
xenon at <num> concentration along with <num> oxygen rapidly produces the unconsciousness of general anesthesia and has been used for this as discussed above
breathing mixes gases of different densities very effectively and rapidly so that heavier gases are purged along with the oxygen and do not accumulate at the bottom of the lungs
there is however a danger associated with any heavy gas in large quantities it may sit invisibly in a container and if a person enters a container filled with an odorless colorless gas they may find themselves breathing it unknowingly
xenon is rarely used in large enough quantities for this to be a concern though the potential for danger exists any time a tank or container of xenon is kept in an unventilated space
she is usually referred to as eva perón spanish ˈeβa peˈɾon or by the affectionate spanish language diminutive evita
she was born in the rural village of los toldos in the pampas as the youngest of five children
at <num> in <year> she moved to the nation 's capital of buenos aires to pursue a career as a stage radio and film actress
she met colonel juan perón there on <num> january <year> during a charity event at the luna park stadium to benefit the victims of an earthquake in san juan argentina
the two were married the following year
juan perón was elected president of argentina in <year> during the next <num> years eva perón became powerful within the pro @-@ peronist trade unions primarily for speaking on behalf of labor rights
she also ran the ministries of labor and health founded and ran the charitable eva perón foundation championed women 's suffrage in argentina and founded and ran the nation 's first large @-@ scale female political party the female peronist party
in <year> eva perón announced her candidacy for the peronist nomination for the office of vice president of argentina receiving great support from the peronist political base low @-@ income and working @-@ class argentines who were referred to as descamisados or shirtless ones
however opposition from the nation 's military and bourgeoisie coupled with her declining health ultimately forced her to withdraw her candidacy
in <year> shortly before her death from cancer at <num> eva perón was given the title of spiritual leader of the nation by the argentine congress
eva perón was given a state funeral upon her death a prerogative generally reserved for heads of state
eva perón has become a part of international popular culture most famously as the subject of the musical evita <year>
cristina álvarez rodríguez evita 's great @-@ niece claims that evita has never left the collective consciousness of argentines
cristina fernández de kirchner the first elected female president of argentina claims that women of her generation owe a debt to eva for her example of passion and combativeness
according to junín 's civil registry a birth certificate shows that one maría eva duarte was born on <num> may <year>
her baptismal certificate however lists the date of birth as <num> may <year> under the name eva maría ibarguren
it is thought that in <year> the adult eva perón created a forgery of her birth certificate for her marriage
eva perón spent her childhood in junín buenos aires province
her father juan duarte was descended from french basque immigrants meanwhile her mother juana ibarguren was descended from spanish basque immigrants
juan duarte a wealthy rancher from nearby chivilcoy already had a wife and family there
at that time in rural argentina it was not uncommon for a wealthy man to have multiple families
when eva was a year old duarte returned permanently to his legal family leaving juana ibarguren and her children in penury
ibarguren and her children were forced to move to the poorest area of junín
los toldos was a village in the dusty region of las pampas with a reputation as a desolate place of abject poverty
to support herself and her children ibarguren sewed clothes for neighbors
the family was stigmatized by the abandonment of the father and by the illegitimate status of the children under argentine law and was consequently somewhat isolated
a desire to expunge this part of her life might have been a motivation for eva to arrange the destruction of her original birth certificate in <year>
when duarte suddenly died and his mistress and their children sought to attend his funeral there was an unpleasant scene at the church gates
although juana and the children were permitted to enter and pay their respects to duarte they were promptly directed out of the church
mrs
juan duarte did not want her husband 's mistress and children at the funeral and as those of the legitimate wife her orders were respected
biographer john barnes writes that after this abandonment all duarte left to the family was a document declaring that the children were his thus enabling them to use the duarte surname
soon after juana moved her children to a one @-@ room apartment in junín
to pay the rent on their single @-@ roomed home mother and daughters took up jobs as cooks in the houses of the local estancias
eventually owing to eva 's older brother 's financial help the family moved into a bigger house which they later transformed into a boarding house
during this time young eva often participated in school plays and concerts
one of her favorite pastimes was the cinema
though eva 's mother apparently had a few plans for eva wanting to marry her off to one of the local bachelors eva herself dreamed of becoming a famous actress
eva 's love of acting was reinforced when in october <year> she played a small role in a school play called arriba estudiantes students arise which barnes describes as an emotional patriotic flag @-@ waving melodrama
after the play eva was determined to become an actress
in <year> at the age of <num> eva escaped her poverty @-@ stricken village when according to popular myth she ran off with a young musician to the nation 's capital of buenos aires
the young couple 's relationship would end almost as quickly as it began but eva remained in buenos aires
she began to pursue jobs on the stage and the radio and eventually became a film actress
eva had a series of relationships and via some of these men she did acquire a number of her modeling appointments
she bleached her natural black hair to blond a look she would maintain for the duration of her life
it is often reported that eva traveled to buenos aires by train with tango singer agustín magaldi
however biographers marysa navarro and nicholas fraser maintain that this is unlikely as there is no record of the married magaldi performing in junín in <year> and even if he had he usually traveled with his wife
eva 's sisters maintain that eva traveled to buenos aires with their mother
the sisters also claim that doña juana accompanied her daughter to an audition at a radio station and arranged for eva to live with the bustamante family who were friends of the duarte family
while the method of eva 's escape from her bleak provincial surroundings is debated she did begin a new life in buenos aires
buenos aires in the <num> was known as the paris of south america
the center of the city had many cafés restaurants theaters movie houses shops and bustling crowds
in direct contrast the <num> were also years of great unemployment poverty and hunger in the capital and many new arrivals from the interior were forced to live in tenements boardinghouses and in outlying shanties that became known as villas miserias
upon arrival in buenos aires eva duarte was faced with the difficulties of surviving without formal education or connections
the city was especially overcrowded during this period because of the migrations caused by the great depression
on <num> march <year> she had her professional debut in the play mrs
perez la señora de pérez at the comedias theater
in <year> eva toured nationally with a theater company worked as a model and was cast in a few b @-@ grade movie melodramas
in <year> eva experienced some economic stability when a company called candilejas sponsored by a soap manufacturer hired her for a daily role in one of their radio dramas called muy bien which aired on radio el mundo world radio the most important radio station in the country at that time
later that year she signed a five @-@ year contract with radio belgrano which assured her a role in a popular historical @-@ drama program called great women of history in which she played elizabeth i of england sarah bernhardt and the last tsarina of russia
eventually eva duarte came to co @-@ own the radio company
by <year> eva duarte was earning five or six thousand pesos a month making her one of the highest @-@ paid radio actresses in the nation
pablo raccioppi who jointly ran radio el mundo with eva duarte is said to have not liked her but to have noted that she was thoroughly dependable
eva also had a short @-@ lived film career but none of the films in which she appeared were hugely successful
in one of her last films la cabalgata del circo the circus cavalcade eva played a young country girl who rivaled an older woman the movie 's star libertad lamarque
as a result of her success with radio dramas and the films eva achieved some financial stability
in <year> she was able to move into her own apartment in the exclusive neighborhood of recoleta on <year> calle posadas
the next year eva began her career in politics as one of the founders of the argentine radio syndicate ara
in response perón who was then the secretary of labour established a fund to raise money to aid the victims
he devised a plan to have an artistic festival as a fundraiser and invited radio and film actors to participate
after a week of fundraising all participants met at a gala held at luna park stadium in buenos aires to benefit earthquake victims
it was at this gala on <num> january <year> that eva duarte first met colonel juan perón
eva promptly became the colonel 's mistress
eva referred to the day she met her future husband as her marvelous day
fraser and navarro write that juan perón and eva left the gala together at around two in the morning
fraser and navarro claim that eva duarte had no knowledge of or interest in politics prior to meeting perón
therefore she never argued with perón or any of his inner circle but merely absorbed what she heard
juan perón later claimed in his memoir that he purposefully selected eva as his pupil and set out to create in her a second i
fraser and navarro however suggest that juan perón allowed eva duarte such intimate exposure and knowledge of his inner circle because of his age he was <num> and she was <num> when they met
he had come to politics late in life and was therefore free of preconceived ideas of how his political career should be conducted and he was willing to accept whatever aid she offered him
in may <year> it was announced that broadcast performers must organize themselves into a union and that this union would be the only one permitted to operate in argentina
shortly after the union formed eva duarte was elected its president
fraser and navarro speculate that juan perón made the suggestion that performers create a union and the other performers likely felt it was good politics to elect his mistress
shortly after her election as president of the union eva duarte began a daily program called toward a better future which dramatized in soap opera form the accomplishments of juan perón
often perón 's own speeches were played during the program
when she spoke eva duarte spoke in ordinary language as a regular woman who wanted listeners to believe what she herself believed about juan perón
president pedro pablo ramírez became wary of juan perón 's growing power within the government but was unable to curb that power
on <num> february <year> ramírez signed his own resignation paper which fraser and navarro claim was drafted by juan perón himself
edelmiro julián farrell a friend of juan perón became president
juan perón returned to his job as labor minister
fraser and navarro claim that by this point perón was the most powerful man in the argentine government
on <num> october <year> juan perón was arrested by his opponents within the government who feared that due to the strong support of the descamisados the workers and the poor of the nation perón 's popularity might eclipse that of the sitting president
six days later between <num> @,@ <num> and <num> @,@ <num> people gathered in front of the casa rosada argentina 's government house to demand juan perón 's release and their wish was granted
at <num> pm juan perón stepped on to the balcony of the casa rosada and addressed the crowd
biographer robert d
crassweller claims that this moment was very powerful because it was very dramatic and recalled many important aspects of argentine history
crassweller writes that juan perón enacted the role of a caudillo addressing his people in the tradition of argentine leaders rosas and yrigoyen
crassweller also claims that the evening contained mystic overtones of a quasi @-@ religious nature
eva perón has often been credited with organizing the rally of thousands that freed juan perón from prison on <num> october <year>
this version of events was popularized in the movie version of the lloyd webber musical
most historians however agree that this version of events is unlikely
at the time of perón 's imprisonment eva was still merely an actress
she had no political clout with the various labor unions and it is claimed that she was not well @-@ liked within perón 's inner circle nor was she liked by many within the film and radio business at this point
when juan perón was imprisoned eva duarte was suddenly disenfranchised
in reality the massive rally that freed perón from prison was organized by the various unions such as general labor confederation or cgt as they came to be known
to this day the date of <num> october is something of a holiday for the justicialist party in argentina celebrated as día de la lealtad or loyalty day
what would follow was shocking and nearly unheard of
the well connected and politically rising star juan peron married eva
despite eva 's childhood illegitimacy and having an uncertain reputation peron was in love with eva and her loyal devotion to him even while he had been under arrest touched him deeply and so he married her providing a respectability she had never known
eva and juan were married discreetly in a civil ceremony in junín on <num> october <year> and in a church wedding on <num> december <year>
eva campaigned heavily for her husband during his <year> presidential bid
using her weekly radio show she delivered powerful speeches with heavy populist rhetoric urging the poor to align themselves with perón 's movement
though she had become wealthy from her radio and modeling success she highlighted her own humble upbringing as a way of showing solidarity with the impoverished classes
along with her husband eva visited every corner of the country becoming the first woman in argentina 's history to appear in public on the campaign trail with her husband
eva 's appearance alongside her husband often offended the establishment of the wealthy the military and those in political life
however she was very popular with the general public who knew her from her radio and motion picture appearances
it was during this phase of her life that she first encouraged the argentine population to refer to her not as eva perón but simply as evita which is a spanish diminutive or affectionate nickname roughly equivalent to little eva or evie
biographers fraser and navarro write that the tour had its genesis in an invitation the spanish leader had extended to juan perón
for political reasons it was decided that eva rather than juan perón should make the visit
fraser and navarro write that argentina had only recently emerged from its wartime quarantine thus taking its place in the united nations and improving relations with the united states
therefore a visit to franco with antónio salazar of portugal the last remaining west european authoritarian leaders in power would be diplomatically frowned upon internationally
fraser and navarro write that eva decided that if juan perón would not accept franco 's invitation for a state visit to spain then she would
advisors then decided that eva should visit many european countries in addition to spain
this would make it seem that eva 's sympathies were not specifically with franco 's fascist spain but with all of europe
the tour was billed not as a political tour but as a non @-@ political goodwill tour
eva was well received in spain where she visited the tombs of spanish monarchs ferdinand and isabella in the capilla real de granada
francoist spain had not recovered from the spanish civil war the autarkic economy and the un embargo meant that the country could not feed its people
during her visit to spain eva handed out <num> @-@ peseta notes to many poor children she met on her journey
she also received from franco the highest award given by the spanish government the order of isabella the catholic
eva then visited rome where the reception was not as warm as it had been in spain
though pope pius xii did not give her a papal decoration she was allowed the time usually allotted queens and was given a rosary
her next stop was france where she was generally well received
she visited the palace of versailles among other sites
she also met with charles de gaulle
she promised france two shipments of wheat
while in france eva received word that george vi would not receive her when she planned to visit britain regardless of what his foreign office might advise and that her visit would not be viewed as a state visit
fraser and navarro wrote that eva regarded the royal family 's refusal to meet her as a snub and canceled the trip to the united kingdom
eva however gave exhaustion as the official reason for not going on to britain
eva also visited switzerland during her european tour a visit that has been viewed as the worst part of the trip
according to the book evita a biography by john barnes while she traveled down a street with many people crowding her car someone threw two stones and smashed the windshield
she threw her hands up in shock but was not injured
later while sitting with the foreign minister protesters threw tomatoes at her
the tomatoes hit the foreign minister and splattered on eva 's dress
after these two events eva had had enough and after two months returned to argentina
members of the peronist opposition speculated that the true purpose of the european tour was to deposit funds in a swiss bank account
the opposition in buenos aires write fraser and navarro assumed that the genuine purpose of the whole european visit was for eva and her husband to deposit money in swiss bank accounts and that the rest had been devised to conceal this
many wealthy argentines did this but there are many more convenient and less conspicuous ways of depositing money in swiss accounts than meeting the swiss foreign minister and being shown around a watch factory
fraser and navarro conclude was there a swiss bank account it seems unlikely
during her tour to europe eva perón was featured in a cover story for time magazine
the cover 's caption – eva perón between two worlds an argentine rainbow – was a reference to the name given to eva 's european tour the rainbow tour
this was the only time in the periodical 's history that a south american first lady appeared alone on its cover
in <year> eva appeared again with juan perón
however the <year> cover story was also the first publication to mention that eva had been born out of wedlock
in retaliation the periodical was banned from argentina for several months
after returning to argentina from europe evita never again appeared in public with the complicated hairdos of her movie star days
the brilliant gold color became more subdued in tone and even the style changed her hair being pulled back severely into a heavy braided chignon
additionally her extravagant clothing became more refined after the tour
no longer did she wear the elaborate hats and form @-@ fitting dresses of argentine designers
soon she adopted simpler and more fashionable paris couture and became particularly attached to the fashions of christian dior and the jewels of cartier
in an attempt to cultivate a more serious political persona eva began to appear in public wearing conservative though stylish tailleurs a business @-@ like combination of skirts and jackets which also were made by dior and other paris couture houses
fraser and navarro write that at one point the sociedad had been an enlightened institution caring for orphans and homeless women but that those days had long since passed by the time of the first term of juan perón
in the <num> the sociedad had been supported by private contributions largely those of the husbands of the society ladies
but by the <num> the sociedad was supported by the government
it had been the tradition of the sociedad to elect the first lady of argentina as president of the charity
but the ladies of the sociedad did not approve of eva perón 's impoverished background lack of formal education and former career as an actress
fraser and navarro write that the ladies of the sociedad were afraid that evita would set a bad example for the orphans therefore the society ladies did not extend to evita the position of president of their organization
it has often been said that evita had the government funding for the sociedad cut off in retaliation
fraser and navarro suggest that this version of events is in dispute but that the government funding that had previously supported the sociedad now went to support evita 's own foundation
the fundación maría eva duarte de perón was created on <num> july <year>
it was later renamed to simply the eva perón foundation
its funding began with <num> @,@ <num> pesos provided by evita herself
in the woman with the whip the first english language biography of eva perón author mary main writes that no account records were kept for the foundation because it was merely a means of funneling government money into private swiss bank accounts controlled by the peróns
fraser and navarro however counter these claims writing that ramón cereijo minister of finance kept records and that the foundation began as the simplest response to the poverty evita encountered each day in her office and the appalling backwardness of social services — or charity as it was still called — in argentina
crassweller writes that the foundation was supported by donations of cash and goods from the peronist unions and private businesses and that the confederación general del trabajo donated three man @-@ days later reduced to two of salary for every worker per year
tax on lottery and movie tickets also helped to support the foundation as did a levy on casino and revenue from horse races
crassweller also notes that there were some cases of businesses being pressured to donate to the foundation with negative repercussions resulting if requests for donations were not met
within a few years the foundation had assets in cash and goods in excess of three billion pesos or over <num> million at the exchange rate of the late <num>
it employed <num> @,@ <num> workers of whom <num> @,@ <num> were construction workers and <num> priests
it purchased and distributed annually <num> @,@ <num> pairs of shoes <num> @,@ <num> sewing machines <num> @,@ <num> cooking pots
the foundation also gave scholarships built homes hospitals and other charitable institutions
every aspect of the foundation was under evita 's supervision
the foundation also built entire communities such as evita city which still exists today
fraser and navarro claim that due to the works and health services of the foundation for the first time in history there was no inequality in argentine health care
fraser and navarro write that it was evita 's work with the foundation that played a large role in her idealization even leading some to consider her a saint
though it was unnecessary from a practical standpoint evita set aside many hours per day to meet with the poor who requested help from her foundation
during these meetings with the poor evita often kissed the poor and allowed them to kiss her
evita was even witnessed placing her hands in the suppurated wounds of the sick and poor touching the leprous and kissing the syphilitic
fraser and navarro write that though argentina is secular in many respects it is essentially a catholic country
therefore when evita kissed the syphilitic and touched the leprous she
ceased to be the president 's wife and acquired some of the characteristics of saints depicted in catholicism
poet josé maría castiñeira de dios a man from a wealthy background reflected on the times he witnessed evita meeting with the poor i had had a sort of literary perception of the people and the poor and she had given me a christian one thus allowing me to become a christian in the profoundest sense
fraser and navarro write that toward the end of her life evita was working as many as <num> to <num> hours per day in her foundation often ignoring her husband 's request that she cut back on her workload and take the weekends off
the more she worked with the poor in her foundation the more she adopted an outraged attitude toward the existence of poverty saying sometimes i have wished my insults were slaps or lashes
i 've wanted to hit people in the face to make them see if only for a day what i see each day i help the people
crassweller writes that evita became fanatical about her work in the foundation and felt on a crusade against the very concept and existence of poverty and social ills
it is not surprising writes crassweller that as her public crusades and her private adorations took on a narrowing intensity after <year> they simultaneously veered toward the transcendental
crassweller compares evita to ignatius loyola saying she came to be akin to a one @-@ woman jesuit order
while eva did make radio addresses in support of women 's suffrage and also published articles in her democracia newspaper asking male peronists to support women 's right to vote ultimately the ability to grant to women the right to vote was beyond eva 's powers
fraser and navarro claim that eva 's actions were limited to supporting a bill introduced by one of her supporters eduardo colom a bill that was eventually dropped
a new women 's suffrage bill was introduced which the senate of argentina sanctioned on <num> august <year>
it was necessary to wait more than a year before the house of representatives sanctioned it on <num> september <year>
law <num> @,@ <num> established the equality of political rights between men and women and universal suffrage in argentina
finally law <num> @,@ <num> was approved unanimously
in a public celebration and ceremony however juan perón signed the law granting women the right to vote and then he handed the bill to eva symbolically making it hers
eva perón then created the female peronist party the first large female political party in the nation
navarro and fraser write that by <year> the party had <num> @,@ <num> members and <num> @,@ <num> headquarters across the country
navarro and fraser write that while eva perón did not consider herself a feminist her impact on the political life of women was decisive
thousands of previously apolitical women entered politics because of eva perón
they were the first women active in argentine politics
the combination of female suffrage and the organization of the female peronist party granted juan perón a large majority sixty @-@ three percent of the vote in the <year> presidential elections
this move angered many military leaders who despised evita and her increasing powers within the government
according to the argentine constitution the vice president automatically succeeds the president in the event of the president 's death
the possibility of evita becoming president in the event of juan perón 's death was not something the military could accept
she did however receive great support from the working class the unions and the peronist women 's party
the intensity of the support she drew from these groups is said to have surprised even juan perón himself
fraser and navarro write that the wide support evita 's proposed candidacy generated indicated to him that evita had become as important to members of the peronist party as juan perón himself was
on <num> august <year> the unions held a mass rally of two million people called cabildo abierto
the name cabildo abierto was a reference and tribute to the first local argentine government of the may revolution in <year>
the peróns addressed the crowd from the balcony of a huge scaffolding set up on the avenida <num> de julio several blocks away from the casa rosada the official government house of argentina
overhead were two large portraits of eva and juan perón
it has been claimed that cabildo abierto was the largest public display of support in history for a female political figure
at the mass rally the crowd demanded that evita publicly announce her candidacy as vice president
she pleaded for more time to make her decision
the exchange between evita and the crowd of two million became for a time a genuine and spontaneous dialogue with the crowd chanting ¡ evita vice @-@ presidente when evita asked for more time so she could make up her mind the crowd demanded ¡ ahora evita ahora now evita now
eventually they came to a compromise
evita told the audience that she would announce her decision over the radio a few days later
hopes and dreams of the people to the president a woman who eventually turned those hopes and dreams into glorious reality
in peronist rhetoric this event has come to be referred to as the renunciation portraying evita as having been a selfless woman in line with the hispanic myth of marianismo
most biographers however postulate that evita did not so much renounce her ambition as bow to pressure from her husband the military and the argentine upper class who preferred that she not enter the race
on <num> january <year> evita fainted in public and underwent surgery three days later
although it was reported that she had undergone an appendectomy she was diagnosed with advanced cervical cancer
fainting continued through <year> including the evening after cabildo abierto with extreme weakness and severe vaginal bleeding
by <year> it had become evident that her health was rapidly deteriorating
although her diagnosis was withheld from her by juan she knew she was not well and a bid for the vice @-@ presidency was not practical
only a few months after the renunciation evita underwent a secret radical hysterectomy in an attempt to eradicate her advanced cervical cancer
in <year> a yale neurosurgeon studied evita 's skull x @-@ rays and photographic evidence and said that perón may have been given a prefrontal lobotomy in the last months of her life
to relieve the pain agitation and anxiety she suffered in the final months of her illness
evita was by this point so ill that she was unable to stand without support
underneath her oversized fur coat was a frame made of plaster and wire that allowed her to stand
she took a triple dose of pain medication before the parade and took another two doses when she returned home
in a ceremony a few days after juan perón 's second inauguration evita was given the official title of spiritual leader of the nation
pack the cancer had metastasized and returned rapidly
she was the first argentine to undergo chemotherapy a novel treatment at that time
despite all available treatment she became emaciated weighing only <num> kg <num> lb by june <year>
evita died at the age of <num> at <num> <num> on saturday <num> july <year>
radio broadcasts throughout the country were interrupted with the announcement that the press secretary 's office of the presidency of the nation fulfills its very sad duty to inform the people of the republic that at <num> <num> hours mrs
eva perón spiritual leader of the nation died
ordinary activities ceased movies stopped playing restaurants were closed and patrons were shown to the door
it soon became apparent however that these measures fell short of reflecting popular grief
the crowd outside of the presidential residence where evita died grew dense congesting the streets for ten blocks in each direction
the morning after her death while evita 's body was being moved to the ministry of labour building eight people were crushed to death in the throngs
in the following <num> hours over <year> people were treated in city hospitals for injuries sustained in the rush to be near evita as her body was being transported and thousands more would be treated on the spot
for the following two weeks lines would stretch for many city blocks with mourners waiting hours to see evita 's body lie at the ministry of labour
the streets of buenos aires overflowed with huge piles of flowers
within a day of perón 's death all flower shops in buenos aires had run out of stock
flowers would be flown in from all over the country and as far away as chile
despite the fact that eva perón never held a political office she was eventually given a state funeral usually reserved for a head of state along with a full roman catholic requiem mass
a memorial was held for the argentine team during the <year> summer olympics in helsinki due to eva perón 's death during those games
on <num> august saturday the body was transferred to the congress building for an additional day of public viewing and a memorial service attended by the entire argentine legislative body
the next day after a final mass the coffin was laid on a gun carriage pulled by cgt officials
it was followed by peron his cabinet eva 's family and friends the delegates and representatives of the partido peronista femenino — then workers nurses and students of the eva peron foundation
flowers were thrown from balconies and windows
there were different interpretations of the popular mourning of eva perón 's death
some reporters viewed the mourning as authentic others saw a public succumbing to another of the passion plays of the peronist regime
time magazine reported that the peronist government enforced the observance of a daily period of five minutes of mourning following a daily radio announcement
during perón 's time children born to unmarried parents did not have the same legal rights as those born to married parents
biographer julie m
taylor professor of anthropology at rice university has said that evita was well aware of the pain of being born illegitimate
taylor speculates that evita 's awareness of this may have influenced her decision to have the law changed so that illegitimate children would henceforth be referred to as natural children
upon her death the argentine public was told that evita was only <num>
the discrepancy was meant to dovetail with evita 's earlier tampering with her birth certificate
after becoming the first lady in <year> evita had her birth records altered to read that she had been born to married parents and placed her birth date three years forward making herself younger
pedro ara was approached to embalm the body
fraser and navarro write that it is doubtful that evita ever expressed a wish to be embalmed and suggest that it was most likely juan perón 's decision
ara was a professor of anatomy who had studied in vienna and maintained an academic career in madrid
his work was occasionally referred to as the art of death
his highly advanced embalming technique consisted of replacing the corpse 's blood with glycerine which preserved all organs including the brain and created a lifelike appearance giving the body the appearance of artistically rendered sleep
ara was known in buenos aires society for his work
among the people he had embalmed was spanish composer manuel de falla
ara claims that his embalming of evita 's corpse began on the night of her death and that by the next morning the body of eva perón was completely and infinitely incorruptible and suitable for display to the public
in the book peron and the enigmas of argentina biographer robert d
crassweller claims that the english @-@ speaking nations of north america and europe largely misunderstood argentina 's response to the death of perón as well as the ornate funeral she was granted
crassweller attributes this misunderstanding to the unique cultural makeup of the peróns and argentina saying that the peróns were of the hispanic tradition and that their opposition was largely of british ancestry
the monument which was to be a statue of a man representing the descamisados was projected to be larger than the statue of liberty
evita 's body was to be stored in the base of the monument and in the tradition of lenin 's corpse to be displayed for the public
while the monument was being constructed evita 's embalmed body was displayed in her former office at the cgt building for almost two years
before the monument to evita was completed juan perón was overthrown in a military coup the revolución libertadora in <year>
perón hastily fled the country and was unable to make arrangements to secure evita 's body
following his flight a military dictatorship took power
the new authorities removed evita 's body from display and its whereabouts were a mystery for <num> years
from <year> until <year> the military dictatorship of argentina issued a ban on peronism
it became illegal not only to possess pictures of juan and eva perón in one 's home but to speak their names
in <year> the military revealed that evita 's body was buried in a crypt in milan italy under the name maría maggi
it appeared that her body had been damaged during its transport and storage such as compressions to her face and disfigurement of one of her feet due to the body having been left in an upright position
in <year> tomás eloy martínez published santa evita a fictionalized work propounding many new stories about the escapades of the corpse
allegations that her body was the object of inappropriate attentions are derived from his description of an emotional necrophilia by embalmers coronel koenig and his assistant arancibia
many primary and secondary references to his novel have inaccurately stated that her body had been defiled in some way resulting in the widespread belief in this myth
also included are allegations that many wax copies had been made that the corpse had been damaged with a hammer and that one of the wax copies was the object of an officer 's sexual attentions
juan and his third wife isabel decided to keep the corpse in their dining room on a platform near the table
in <year> juan perón came out of exile and returned to argentina where he became president for the third time
perón died in office in <year>
his third wife isabel perón whom he had married on <num> november <year> and who had been elected vice @-@ president succeeded him
she became the first female president in the western hemisphere
isabel had eva perón 's body returned to argentina and briefly displayed beside her husband 's
perón 's body was later buried in the duarte family tomb in la recoleta cemetery buenos aires
the previous removal of evita 's body was avenged by the montoneros when they in <year> stole pedro eugenio aramburu 's corpse whom they had previously killed
montoneros then used the captive body of aramburu to pressure for the repatriation of evita 's body
once evita 's body arrived in argentina the montoneros gave up aramburu 's corpse and abandoned it in a street in buenos aires
the argentine government took elaborate measures to make perón 's tomb secure
the tomb 's marble floor has a trapdoor that leads to a compartment containing two coffins
under that compartment is a second trapdoor and a second compartment
that is where perón 's coffin rests
biographers marysa navarro and nicholas fraser write that the claim is often made that her tomb is so secure that it could withstand a nuclear attack
it reflects a fear they write a fear that the body will disappear from the tomb and that the woman or rather the myth of the woman will reappear
in many homes the image of evita is on the wall next to the virgin
in his essay titled latin america published in the oxford illustrated history of christianity john mcmanners claims that the appeal and success of eva perón are related to latin american mythology and concepts of divinity
mcmanners claims that eva perón consciously incorporated aspects of the theology of the virgin and of mary magdalene into her public persona
historian hubert herring has described eva perón as perhaps the shrewdest woman yet to appear in public life in latin america
in a <year> interview tomás eloy martínez referred to eva perón as the cinderella of the tango and the sleeping beauty of latin america
martínez suggested she has remained an important cultural icon for the same reasons as fellow argentine che guevara latin american myths are more resistant than they seem to be
not even the mass exodus of the cuban raft people or the rapid decomposition and isolation of fidel castro 's regime have eroded the triumphal myth of che guevara which remains alive in the dreams of thousands of young people in latin america africa and europe
che as well as evita symbolize certain naive but effective beliefs the hope for a better world a life sacrificed on the altar of the disinherited the humiliated the poor of the earth
they are myths which somehow reproduce the image of christ
although not a government holiday the anniversary of eva perón 's death is marked by many argentines each year
additionally eva perón has been featured on argentine coins and a form of argentine currency called evitas was named in her honor
ciudad evita evita city which was established by the eva perón foundation in <year> is located just outside buenos aires
cristina kirchner the first elected female president in argentine history is a peronist who has occasionally been referred to as the new evita
kirchner says she does not want to compare herself to evita claiming she was a unique phenomenon in argentine history
kirchner also says that women of her generation who came of age in the <num> during the military dictatorships in argentina owe a debt to evita for offering an example of passion and combativeness
on <num> july <year> the <num> anniversary of eva perón 's death a museum opened in her honor called museo evita
the museum created by her great @-@ niece cristina alvarez rodriquez houses many of eva perón 's clothes portraits and artistic renderings of her life and has become a popular tourist attraction
the museum was opened in a building that was once used by the eva perón foundation
in the book eva perón the myths of a woman cultural anthropologist julie m
taylor claims that evita has remained important in argentina due to the combination of three unique factors in the images examined the three elements consistently linked — femininity mystical or spirituality power and revolutionary leadership — display an underlying common theme
identification with any one of these elements puts a person or a group at the margins of established society and at the limits of institutional authority
anyone who can identify with all three images lays an overwhelming and echoing claim to dominance through forces that recognize no control in society or its rules
only a woman can embody all three elements of this power
taylor argues that the fourth factor in evita 's continued importance in argentina relates to her status as a dead woman and the power that death holds over the public imagination
taylor suggests that evita 's embalmed corpse is analogous to the incorruptibility of various catholic saints such as bernadette soubirous and has powerful symbolism within the largely catholic cultures of latin america to some extent her continuing importance and popularity may be attributed not only to her power as a woman but also to the power of the dead
however a society 's vision of the afterlife may be structured death by its nature remains a mystery and until society formally allays the commotion it causes a source of disturbance and disorder
women and the dead — death and womanhood — stand in similar relation to structured social forms outside public institutions unlimited by official rules and beyond formal categories
as a female corpse reiterating the symbolic themes of both woman and martyr eva perón perhaps lays double claim to spiritual leadership
john balfour was the british ambassador in argentina during the perón regime and describes evita 's popularity she was by any standard a very extraordinary woman when you think of argentina and indeed latin america as a men dominated part of the world there was this woman who was playing a very great role
and of course she aroused very different feelings in the people with whom she lived
the oligarchs as she called the well @-@ to @-@ do and privileged people hated her
they looked upon her as a ruthless woman
the masses of the people on the other hand worshipped her
they looked upon her as a lady bountiful who was dispensing manna from heaven
in <year> two giant murals of evita were unveiled on the building facades of the current ministry of social development located on <num> de julio avenue
the works were painted by argentine artist alejandro marmo
on <num> july <year> to commemorate the sixtieth anniversary of evita 's death notes were issued in a value of <num> pesos
the controversial effigy of julio argentino roca was replaced by that of eva duarte making her the first actual woman to be featured on the currency of argentina
the image in the notes is based on a <year> design whose sketch was found in the mint made by the engraver sergio pilosio with artist roger pfund
the printing totals <num> million notes it is not clear whether the government will replace the notes that feature roca and the desert campaign
spruille braden a diplomat from the united states who was greatly supported by juan perón 's opponents campaigned against juan perón 's first candidacy on the platform that juan perón was a fascist and a nazi
fraser and navarro also theorize that the perception of the peróns as fascists was enhanced during evita 's <year> european tour during which she was a guest of honor of francisco franco
by <year> franco had become politically isolated as one of the few remaining fascists to retain power
franco therefore was in desperate need of a political ally
with nearly a third of argentina 's population of spanish descent it seemed natural for argentina to have diplomatic relations with spain
commenting on the international perception of evita during her <year> european tour fraser and navarro write it was inevitable that evita be viewed in a fascist context
therefore both evita and perón were seen to represent an ideology which had run its course in europe only to re @-@ emerge in an exotic theatrical even farcical form in a faraway country
laurence levine the former president of the u
s
-argentine chamber of commerce writes that in contrast to nazi ideology the peróns were not anti @-@ semitic
in the book inside argentina from perón to menem <year> – <year> from an american point of view levine writes the american government demonstrated no knowledge of perón 's deep admiration for italy and his distaste for germany whose culture he found too rigid
nor did they appreciate that although anti @-@ semitism existed in argentina perón 's own views and his political associations were not anti @-@ semitic
they paid no attention to the fact that perón sought out the jewish community in argentina to assist in developing his policies and that one of his most important allies in organizing the industrial sector was josé ber gelbard a jewish immigrant from poland
biographer robert d
crassweller writes peronism was not fascism and peronism was not nazism
crassweller also refers to the comments of u
s
ambassador george s
messersmith
while visiting argentina in <year> messersmith made the following statement there is not as much social discrimination against jews here as there is right in new york or in most places at home
time magazine published an article by tomás eloy martínez — argentine writer journalist and former director of the latin american program at rutgers university — titled the woman behind the fantasy prostitute fascist profligate — eva peron was much maligned mostly unfairly
in this article martínez writes that the accusations that eva perón was a fascist a nazi and a thief had been made against her for decades
he wrote that the allegations were untrue she was not a fascist — ignorant perhaps of what that ideology meant
and she was not greedy
though she liked jewelry furs and dior dresses she could own as many as she desired without the need to rob others
in <year> jorge luis borges stated that the mother of that woman evita was the madam of a whorehouse in junín
he repeated the calumny so often that some still believe it or more commonly think evita herself whose lack of sex appeal is mentioned by all who knew her apprenticed in that imaginary brothel
around <year> the pamphleteer silvano santander employed the same strategy to concoct letters in which evita figures as an accomplice of the nazis
it is true that juan perón facilitated the entrance of nazi criminals to argentina in <year> and <year> thereby hoping to acquire advanced technology developed by the germans during the war
but evita played no part
in his <year> doctoral dissertation at ohio state university lawrence d
bell writes that the governments that preceded juan perón had been anti @-@ semitic but that his government was not
juan perón eagerly and enthusiastically attempted to recruit the jewish community into his government and set up a branch of the peronist party for jewish members known as the organización israelita argentina oia
perón 's government was the first to court the argentine jewish community and the first to appoint jewish citizens to public office
kevin passmore writes that the peronist regime more than any other in latin america has been accused of being fascist
but he says that the peronist regime was not fascist and what passed for fascism under perón never took hold in latin america
additionally because the peronist regime allowed rival political parties to exist it cannot be described as totalitarian
the most successful rendering of eva perón 's life has been the musical production evita
the musical began as a concept album co @-@ produced by tim rice and andrew lloyd webber in <year> with julie covington in the title role
elaine paige was later cast in the title role when the concept album was adapted into a musical stage production in london 's west end and won the <year> olivier award for best performance in a musical
in <year> patti lupone won the tony award for best leading actress in a musical for her performance as the title character in the broadway production
nicholas fraser claims that to date the musical stage production has been performed on every continent except antarctica and has generated over <num> billion in revenue
as early as <year> the musical was considered as the basis for a movie
after a nearly <num> @-@ year production delay madonna was cast in the title role for the <year> film version and won the golden globe award for best actress in a musical or comedy
in response to the american film and in an alleged attempt to offer a more politically accurate depiction of evita 's life an argentine film company released eva perón the true story
the argentine production starred actress esther goris in the title role
this movie was the <year> argentine submission for the oscar in the category of best foreign language film
nicholas fraser writes that evita is the perfect popular culture icon for our times because her career foreshadowed what by the late <num> century had become common
during evita 's time it was considered scandalous for a former entertainer to take part in public political life
her detractors in argentina had often accused evita of turning public political life into show business
but by the late <num> century fraser claims the public had become engrossed in the cult of celebrity and public political life had become insignificant
in this regard evita was perhaps ahead of her time
fraser also writes that evita 's story is appealing to our celebrity @-@ obsessed age because her story confirms one of hollywood 's oldest clichés the rags to riches story
reflecting on eva perón 's popularity more than half a century after her death alma guillermoprieto writes that evita 's life has evidently just begun
the series was written by brian michael bendis illustrated by alex maleev and published by marvel comics
uprising tells a story set between the ending of the <year> video game halo <num> and the beginning of its sequel halo <num> as earth is under attack by a collective of alien races known as the covenant
the series was intended to be released and concluded before halo <num> shipped on september <num> <year> but the final issue did not appear until april <year>
the series was brought together by ruwan jayatilleke marvel 's vice president of development
he attained the license to publish halo comics including the single @-@ volume the halo graphic novel in <year>
the graphic novel 's critical and commercial success prompted marvel to announce a new halo limited series in <year> with jayatilleke serving as the series editor
bendis a long @-@ time halo fan was excited about adding to the franchise story
reception to the series was lukewarm
the series artistic style was generally praised
however the lack of master chief @-@ focused action and character development — as well as the delays in publishing — led to average reviews
the series was commercially successful and appeared in the top slot of the new york times graphic books bestsellers list
jayatilleke noted that bungie 's dedication to creating a believable world compelling to both hardcore and casual fans made the series an attractive fit for marvel
in <year> marvel learned that bungie had already created an original graphic novel entitled the halo graphic novel but needed a publisher and distributor
interested brian michael bendis and jayatilleke visited bungie to take up the offer of publishing the halo graphic novel as well as to discuss the possibility of a tie @-@ in comic book series
the halo graphic novel proved to be a critical and commercial success the comic debuted at the number two position on the diamond comic distributors sales charts and more than <num> @,@ <num> copies were published
marvel comics and bungie announced the first halo limited comic series halo uprising at the san diego comic @-@ con <year>
brian michael bendis writer for the series said in an interview he was honored to add to the halo lore
he noted that the graphic novel brought humanity and perspective to the franchise something not easily imparted through the games
bendis described himself as a longtime player of halo and had done his halo homework reading and playing everything halo
bendis stated that bungie was open to the marvel team exploring lesser @-@ known elements of the halo universe or even bringing up new ideas as opposed to sticking to a script or set of preplanned ideas from bungie or microsoft
the philadelphia daily news suggested that a halo comic book would attract readers who had never picked up a comic book before
bendis said that drawing casual gamers to the comics was a major goal for the series
while using established characters meant that bendis had to cooperate with bungie and microsoft he said he did not feel it was a restriction
you can get pretty bloated and sloppy with total autonomy all the time
the bungie team allowed bendis to explore lesser known areas of the halo story which he enjoyed
writing the dialogue for the master chief who is faceless and normally silent during gameplay was a challenge bendis scrapped much of the drafted dialogue to allow maleev 's work to define the character
originally halo uprising 's entire four @-@ issue series was to be published before the september <num> <year> release of halo <num>
bendis suggested that the series might be delayed unexpectedly due to the close cooperation between marvel and bungie
for unspecified reasons the release of all issues of halo uprising were pushed back
issue <num> 's original date of august <num> <year> was pushed back a week to august <num>
issue <num> 's original date of august <num> was pushed back and released on november <num>
issue <num> was originally slated for a september <year> release but was pushed to a final release date of nearly a year late in august <year>
the constant revisions of the date became a running forum joke at the fan site halo
bungie

issue <num> also saw multiple delays pushed from a scheduled october <num> <year> release to march <num> and then march <num> <year>
claude errera of halo
bungie
org noted that given the series track record and the fact that the issue 's release had been moved more than a dozen times by that time its appearance in march would be unlikely
in announcing two new halo comic series from marvel in february <year> jayatilleke informed ign that the final issue was in the process of being colored
the final release date for the issue was april <num>
the series was collected into a single volume released in may <year> isbn <num> @-@ <num> @-@ <num> @-@ <num>
the collected hardcover features a variety of bonus art and making of materials
the supersoldier master chief is stowed away aboard an ancient forerunner ship
on a course set for earth he is overwhelmed by a covenant strike force and rendered unconscious
in the next scene colonel james ackerson is being tortured by covenant forces on mars to whom he betrays the existence of something called the key of osanalan
ackerson admits the key is located in cleveland ohio
in cleveland the narrative follows the point of view of a hotel concierge named ruwan as the city falls under attack by covenant forces
in the mayhem he meets a woman named myras tyla
tyla remains calm even as ruwan edges towards all @-@ out panic
the pair are captured and with other residents herded into a sports stadium
the covenant declare that the humans must give up the location of the key to save their lives tyla is confused but ruwan states he knows exactly what it is
on board the forerunner ship the master chief is captured and interrogated by covenant forces but manages to escape using a concealed weapon
on earth ruwan and tyla escape detection by the covenant and appropriate a vehicle in an effort to escape
ruwan reveals that the key is in fact a fictional object that he and his brother james ackerson made up as children james told the covenant about the key in order to prevent the outright destruction of cleveland
after fighting covenant forces ruwan and tyla are rescued by marines and leave the city
the master chief attempts to kill the covenant 's leader prophet of truth but is discovered as he takes aim truth escapes as the chief is left to kill the prophet 's guards and find a way off the ship
learning that there is no way to change the forerunner ship 's destination the chief jumps to earth using a piece of the vessel as a heat shield
after informing the unsc about the true nature of the key ruwan volunteers to give the key to the covenant
he is captured and brought aboard a covenant ship
while the covenant believe he is to be rescued due to a tracker embedded in him ruwan reveals he is actually a target
a coilgun takes aim at his position and destroys the ship
upon learning that the key is a fake the brutes on mars behead ackerson
in a relief camp tyla writes a song about ruwan
the first issue sold out within <num> hours leading marvel to reissue the installment
the collected hardcover edition was the best @-@ selling hardcover graphic book for the week ending june <num> according to the new york times
reception to the miniseries varied
reviewer kevin powers for comics bulletin and richard george of ign praised the action sequences and maleev 's visuals
the balance between action and story was also positively noted powers said that the first two sequences of the opening issue masterfully capture the spirit of the game
on the other hand ign 's jesse schedeen reviewing the second issue stated the series appeal was mostly superficial try as they might to replicate halo 's visceral moments bendis and maleev just can 't replicate the same feeling on the printed page
reviewers criticized the lack of master chief as a main character similar to the response to the halo graphic novel schedeen said that master chief is barely a guest star in his own book and that he was reduced to blasting aliens for much of the series
schedeen felt that there was a lack of connections between the ruwan plot and the master chief 's adventures which was never satisfactorily resolved
the comic 's focus on ruwan and myra 's subplot was also seen as a major fault comics bulletin 's geoff collins in a review of the second issue said that as a comic book fan i ’ m interested in ruwan and myra but the halo fans i know could sic care less about them
and the story in this issue centers around them
schedeen was surprised to find that he only began to care about them in the final issue
the many delays in publishing were a frequent point of frustration as well
schedeen summed up his reviews by saying that he was hopeful the production teams behind the upcoming halo books will learn from the mistakes made here and craft stories that can consistently capture what makes halo fun
at the very least let 's hope we don 't have to wait a year between issues anymore
it stars natasha henstridge ben kingsley michael madsen alfred molina forest whitaker and marg helgenberger
in the film a motley crew of scientists and government agents tries to track down an alien seductress played by natasha henstridge before she successfully mates with a human male
due to her ruthlessness the alien character was cited as an example of negative treatment of female sexuality and aliens by the hollywood film industry
the design of sil was also linked to a chupacabra sighting
the film was conceived by feldman in <year> and was originally pitched as a film treatment in the style of a police procedural entitled the message
when the message failed to attract the studios feldman re @-@ wrote it as a spec script which ultimately led to the making of the film
the extraterrestrial in species an alien woman named sil was designed by h
r
giger also responsible for the beings from the alien franchise
the effects combined practical models done by giger collaborator steve johnson and xfx with computer @-@ generated imagery done by richard edlund 's boss film studios
giger felt the film and the character were too similar to alien so he pushed for script changes
most of the principal photography was done in los angeles california where the film is set
several scenes were filmed in utah and at the arecibo observatory in puerto rico
the film was poorly received by critics but nevertheless turned out to be a box office success grossing us <num> million <num> million in <year> dollars
it spawned one theatrical sequel species ii as well as two direct @-@ to @-@ video sequels species iii and species the awakening
species was adapted into a novel by yvonne navarro and two comic book series by dark horse comics one of which was written by feldman
in hopes of finding life beyond earth
they then receive transmissions from an alien source on how to create endless fuel effortlessly
therefore the scientists assume that this is a friendly alien species
from a second alien transmission the scientists receive information about an alien dna along with instructions on how to splice it with human dna
a government team led by xavier fitch ben kingsley goes forward with the genetic experiment attempting to induce a female under the later proved to be mistaken assumption that a female would have more docile and controllable traits
one of the hundred experimental ova produces a girl named sil who looks like a normal human but develops into a <num> @-@ year @-@ old in <num> months
sil 's violent outbursts during sleep make the scientists consider her a threat
they try to kill her using cyanide gas but she breaks out of her containment cell and escapes
the government assembles a team composed of anthropologist dr
stephen arden alfred molina molecular biologist dr
laura baker marg helgenberger empath dan smithson forest whitaker and mercenary preston press lennox michael madsen to track and destroy sil
sil matures rapidly into an adult natasha henstridge in her early twenties and makes her way to los angeles
her body strength regenerative ability and intelligence make tracking her extremely difficult
the scientists fear she may mate with human males and produce offspring that could eliminate the human race
sil is intent on producing offspring as soon as possible and kills several people to prevent them from notifying the authorities or simply to use their clothing
sil first tries to mate with a man she meets at a nightclub anthony guidera but after sensing that he is diabetic she rejects him
unsatisfied he tries to rape her prompting her to kill him by puncturing his skull with her tongue
she then tries to mate with john carey whip hubley a man she meets after a car accident
they swim in carey 's pool where sil forces him to open his swimming trunks in order to mate but he refuses
this act is interrupted by preston and laura
she kills carey morphing into her alien form a bipedal mutant with tentacles on her shoulders and back and flees naked into a forest without being seen by the team
she pretends to be a rape victim to kidnap a woman marliese k
schneider in order to assume her identity
sitting in the car near carey 's home she hypnotizes fitch over distance to order the team to search for her in the nightclub
there she is seen by dan prompting a car chase
she fakes her death by crashing the car which she has previously filled with gasoline containers into a high @-@ voltage transformer using the kidnapped woman as a stand @-@ in for her own body
after cutting and dyeing her hair sil takes an attraction to preston having dreamt of him the previous night
after the team celebrates their apparent victory she stalks them in their hotel and they do not recognize her
arden who is upset at being single walks into his room to find sil waiting there
she has intercourse with arden then kills him when he realizes who she is
dan senses that sil is in the hotel and he alerts preston laura and the rest of the team
she morphs again and escapes and they follow her into the sewers where fitch is subsequently killed
sil gives birth and dan finds her offspring in a cavern behind the sewers
the child attacks him and he kills it
sil angered attacks the trio and tries to kill preston and dan
preston uses a grenade launcher on her blowing her head off and killing her
the trio leaves the area
the last scene shows a rat chewing on one of sil 's severed tentacles it starts to mutate into a vicious beast and attacks another rat
stephen arden forest whitaker as dan smithson marg helgenberger as dr
laura baker even speculates if she was a biological weapon sent by a species who thought humans were like an intergalactic weed
feldman declared that he wanted to explore this theme further in the script as it discussed mankind 's place in the universe and how other civilizations would perceive and relate to humanity considering that maybe humans are not a potential threat maybe a competitor maybe a resource
he also declared that more could be said about sil 's existentialist doubts as she does not know her origin or purpose and only follows her instinct to mate and perpetuate the species
writing for the journal of popular film television susan george authored a paper that dealt with the portrayal of procreation in species gattaca and mimic
george compares the character of fitch to an updated dr
frankenstein and explores the development of sil 's maternal aspirations which convert the character into an archaic mother figure similar to the xenomorph creature in the alien series both of which are she claims portrayed negatively
george further states that a recurring theme in science fiction films is a response to this kind of powerful female sexuality and alien @-@ ness in that the feminine monster must die as sil does at the end of species
feldman himself considered that an underlying theme regarded a female arriving and seeking to find a superior mate
a five @-@ year investigation into accounts of the chupacabra a well known cryptid revealed that the original sighting report of the creature in puerto rico by madeline tolentino may have been inspired by the character sil
this was detailed in paranormal investigator and skeptic benjamin radford 's book tracking the chupacabra
according to virginia fugarino of memorial university of newfoundland writing for the journal of folklore research radford found a link between the original eyewitness report and the design of sil in her alien form and hypothesized that species which tolentino did see before her sighting influenced what she believes she saw of the chupacabra
having read an article by arthur c
clarke about the insurmountable odds against an extraterrestrial craft ever locating and visiting earth given that stellar distances are great and faster @-@ than @-@ light travel is unlikely feldman started to think that it was unsophisticated for any alien culture to come here in what he d describe as a big tin can
thus in turn he considered that the possibility of extraterrestrial contact was through information
then he detailed that a message would contain instructions from across the void to build something that would talk to men
instead of a mechanical device feldman imagined wetware
the visitor would adapt to earth 's environment through dna belonging to earth 's organisms
mankind has sent to space transmissions giving out directions such as the arecibo message which feldman considered unwary as they relay information to potential predators from outer space
he pointed out that in nature one species would not want a predator to know where it hides
therefrom emerged a film treatment called the message
the original script had more of a police procedural approach with the alien being created by a bathtub geneticist who had just had his project aborted by the government and a biologist who had worked on the project getting along with a police officer to search for the creature
eventually feldman came to believe this concept had some credibility issues and instead changed the protagonists to a government team
after coining the name sil feldman initially thought of forming an acronym but in the end chose only the three @-@ letter name after learning about the codons of the genetic code which can be represented in groups of three letters
sil would originally emerge from a dna sequence manipulating human dna and constantly mutate as she used the human junk dna to access all the defenses of the entire animal kingdom that humans evolved through – including ones that had never developed plus ones earth 's scientists don 't know about that have become extinct
among the research feldman did for the script included going to sessions of ucla 's center for the study of evolution and the origin of life cseol talking to seti scientists and visiting the salk institute for biological studies to talk with researchers working on the human genome project
the message was offered to several studios but was passed up
in <year> feldman reworked his ideas into a spec script
this was sent to producer frank mancuso jr
who had hired feldman to adapt sidney kirkpatrick 's a cast of killers
the producer got attracted to the creative possibilites as the film offered the challenge of walking that fine line between believability and pushing something as far as it can go
metro @-@ goldwyn @-@ mayer got interested on the project and while feldman had some initial disagreements on the budget after considering other studios he signed with mgm
in turn the now retitled species attracted director roger donaldson who was attracted to its blend of science fiction and thriller
the script underwent eight different drafts written over an eight @-@ month period before donaldson was content that flaws in the story 's logic had been corrected
at one point another writer larry gross tried his hand with the script but ultimately all the work was done by feldman
feldman would remain as a co @-@ producer
while the initial species script suggested a love triangle between sil and two government team members the dissatisfaction of the crew eventually led to changes to the ending which ended up featuring sil having a baby that would immediately prove dangerous
r
giger who also created the creatures in the alien films
donaldson thought giger was the best man for the film after reading his compendium necronomicon and eventually he and mancuso flew to switzerland to meet the artist
what attracted giger was the opportunity to design a monster in another way — an aesthetic warrior also sensual and deadly like the women look in his paintings
while giger opted to stay in switzerland to take care of his dying mother instead of flying to los angeles to accompany production he built some puppets in his own studio and later faxed sketches and airbrush paintings as production went through
the practical models were made by steve johnson and his company xfx which had already worked with giger 's designs in poltergeist ii
giger had envisioned more stages of sil 's transformation but the film only employed the last one where she is transparent outside and black inside — like a glass body but with carbon inside with xfx doing the translucent skin based on what they had done for the aliens of the abyss
sil 's alien form had both full @-@ body animatronics with replaceable arms heads and torsos and a body suit
richard edlund 's boss film studios was hired for over <num> shots of computer @-@ generated imagery which included one of the earliest forms of motion capture effects
using a two @-@ foot @-@ high <num> cm electric puppet that had sensors translating its movements to a digital sil boss films managed to achieve in one day what would have once taken as much as three weeks with practical effects
giger was unhappy with some elements he found to bear similarity with other movies particularly the alien franchise
at one point he sent a fax to mancuso finding five similarities a chestburster as sil giving birth echoed the infant alien breaking out of its host 's chest the creature having a punching tongue giger at first wanted sil 's tongue to be composed of barbed hooks a cocoon the use of flame throwers and having giger as the creature designer
a great point of contention was the ending which giger considered derivative from the climaxes from both alien <num> and terminator <num> judgment day
the designer felt that horror films frequently held some final confrontation with fire which he considered old @-@ fashioned and linked to medieval witch trials
he sent some ideas for the climax to the producers with them accepting to have sil 's ultimate death occurring by headshot
id club the nightclub featured in the film was built within hollywood 's pantages theater while the hills above dodger stadium near elysian park were used for the car chase and crash where sil fakes her death
for the opening scenes in utah the tooele army depot dubbed as the outside of the research facility — the interiors were shot at the rockwell international corporation laboratory in california — and a victorian @-@ era train station in brigham city was part of sil 's escape
other locations included the santa monica pier and the arecibo telescope in puerto rico
the most complex sets involved the sewer complex and a tar @-@ filled granite cavern where the ending occurs
donaldson wanted a maze quality for the sewers which had traces of realism such as tree roots breaking through from the ceiling and artistic licenses
production designer john muto intentionally designed the sewers wider and taller than real ones as well as with walkways but nevertheless aiming for a claustrophobic and realistic atmosphere
the underground tunnels were built out of structural steel metal rod plaster and concrete to endure the fire effects and had its design based on the la brea tar pits with muto describing them as just the sort of place in which a creature from another planet might feel at home

giger 's design of sil and his work on alien
scott weinberg of dvd talk praised the acting feldman 's screenplay and donaldson 's direction
he concluded by saying that species makes for a very good time for the genre fans
mick lasalle writing for san francisco chronicle was notedly less enthusiastic quipping that if species were a little bit worse it would have a shot at becoming a camp classic
los angeles times critic peter rainer described species as a pretty good boo movie finding it an entertaining thriller while unoriginal and with ineffective tonal shifts
the book gives several in @-@ depth details about the characters not seen in the film such as sil 's ability to visualize odors and determine harmful substances from edible items by the color
gas appears black food appears pink and an unhealthy potential mate appears to give off green fumes
other character details include preston 's background in tracking down awol soldiers as well as the process of decoding the alien signal

<num> km2 of idaho part of boise national forest but the forest manages only <num> @,@ <num> @,@ <num> acres <num> @,@ <num>
<num> km2
the proclaimed boundary is set and can only be changed by congress whereas the administered boundary can be shifted among adjacent national forests without congressional approval
for management and from the visitor 's perspective the forest 's boundaries are its administered area
the forest contains several subranges of the rocky mountains including the boise salmon river and west mountain ranges
much of the forest is underlain by the idaho batholith and the forest is dominated by granitic rock but intrusions of basalt can be found to the west and other volcanic rocks to the south
north of the south fork payette river and east of the north fork payette river the forest is part of the salmon river mountains which extend north and east outside the forest 's boundaries
the south fork salmon river range and the north fork range are subranges of the salmon river mountains within boise national forest
the boise mountains cover much of the southern portion of the forest and contain the forest 's highest point steel mountain but the range 's highest point two point mountain lies outside of the forest 's boundary
the trinity mountains are a subrange in southeastern part of the boise mountains that reach their peak at <num> @,@ <num> feet <num> @,@ <num> m on trinity mountain
the westernmost portion of the forest south and west of lake cascade are part of the west mountains which reach their highest point at <num> @,@ <num> feet <num> @,@ <num> m on snowbank mountain
the danskin mountains are a smaller range on the forest 's southern border that run northwest to southeast
the forest service provides access to and recreation opportunities at the seven reservoirs it borders although it does not own or manage them
there are numerous natural lakes in the forest most of which are tarns created by alpine glaciers during the pleistocene
the largest warm lake is <num> miles <num> km east of cascade in valley county many of the smaller lakes are in the trinity and west mountains
annual water yield on the forest is estimated at <num>
<num> million acre @-@ feet <num>
<num> × <num> <num>
the southern portion of the forest is drained by the boise river the central and western portions by the payette river northeastern portion by the salmon river and far western portions of the emmett ranger district by the weiser river
all four rivers are tributaries of the snake river which itself is a tributary of the columbia river in the pacific basin
idaho 's mountain ranges can block arctic air in the winter but when cold air masses do enter the area they sometimes stagnate in the snake and salmon river valleys causing very cold temperatures to persist
summer and fall are generally dry while intense short @-@ duration thunderstorms can occur in late spring and early summer as atmospheric moisture interacts with warm temperatures and steep topography via orographic lifting
during winter warm moist air from the pacific ocean often brings rain at lower elevations in addition to snowfall throughout the forest
the influence of these pacific maritime air masses increases as latitude increases in the forest
average annual snowfall ranges from <num> inches <num> cm in drier areas and at lower elevations to <num> inches <num> cm in wetter locations and higher elevations
the growing season within the forest ranges from over <num> days in lower elevations to less than <num> days in alpine areas
in addition to species listed or proposed for listing as threatened or endangered under the endangered species act the forest service maintains an independent listing of sensitive species for which it is directed to develop and implement management practices to ensure that species do not become threatened or endangered because of forest service actions
as of february <year> there were <num> species in boise national forest listed as sensitive species <num> mammals <num> amphibian <num> fish <num> birds and <num> plants
the forests are primarily coniferous evergreens dominated by douglas fir and ponderosa and lodgepole pines at lower elevations and engelmann spruce subalpine fir and whitebark pine at higher elevations
grand fir and western larch a coniferous deciduous tree grow in the northern part of the forest where there are moister conditions
quaking aspen a broadleaf deciduous tree grows both in stands among conifers and in monotypic stands throughout the forest at elevations above <num> @,@ <num> feet <num> @,@ <num> m
non @-@ forested areas occupy <num> percent of the forest primarily on south @-@ facing slopes lower elevations in the forest 's southern latitudes or high @-@ elevation areas and are dominated by grasses forbs or shrubs
sacajawea 's bitterroot is a plant species endemic to central idaho including parts of boise national forest being found nowhere else in the world
only about two dozen populations of the plant are known to exist and three @-@ quarters of these are in boise national forest
it is usually found at elevations ranging from <num> @,@ <num> feet <num> @,@ <num> m to <num> @,@ <num> feet <num> @,@ <num> m above sea level and produces white flowers shortly after snowmelt
boise national forest is directed by the u
s
forest service to control the establishment spread or invasion of non @-@ indigenous plant species in otherwise healthy native vegetative ecosystems
the forest 's plan addresses the need to control invasive plants and management efforts include chemical mechanical and biological control methods
invasive plants that are of particular concern in boise national forest include spotted knapweed yellow star @-@ thistle rush skeletonweed and leafy spurge among others
due to the occurrence of frequent non @-@ lethal fires ponderosa pine dominates these forests alongside douglas fir
the understory consists of bluebunch wheatgrass idaho fescue mountain snowberry and bitterbrush in drier areas and elk sedge pinegrass white spirea mallow ninebark and common snowberry at higher elevations
in cool moist areas ranging from <num> @,@ <num> feet <num> @,@ <num> m to <num> @,@ <num> feet <num> @,@ <num> m douglas fir is predominant
lodgepole pine and quaking aspen may be found alongside douglas fir in cooler areas both moist and dry but particularly where frost pockets form
understories in this forest type are dominated by mountain maple mountain ash and blue huckleberry in moister areas and white spirea common snowberry elk sedge and pinegrass in drier areas
between <num> @,@ <num> feet <num> @,@ <num> m and <num> @,@ <num> feet <num> @,@ <num> m in the moist northern parts of the forest grand fir is predominant and western larch is one of the first trees to become established during ecological succession following disturbances whereas understories consist of mountain maple mountain ash blue huckleberry and mallow ninebark
subalpine fir dominates from <num> @,@ <num> feet <num> @,@ <num> m to <num> @,@ <num> feet <num> @,@ <num> m along with mountain maple serviceberry scouler 's willow sitka alder menziesia utah honeysuckle and mountain ash
lodgepole pine dominates in cold dry areas from <num> @,@ <num> feet <num> @,@ <num> m to <num> @,@ <num> feet <num> @,@ <num> m
the understory in lodgepole pine forests can be sparse but includes grasses forbs huckleberries and grouse whortleberry although fires in these forests are typically lethal to trees and understories alike
at the highest elevations forests consist of subalpine fir alongside whitebark pine and engelmann spruce
grasses and forbs tolerant to freezing throughout the growing season occupy the understory
sagebrush typically dominates drier non @-@ forested areas at lower elevations
species that commonly occur with sagebrush include sandberg bluegrass wild onion milk vetches bluebunch wheatgrass bitterbrush gray horsebrush green rabbitbrush and others
in riparian areas below <num> @,@ <num> feet <num> @,@ <num> m trees such as black cottonwood narrowleaf cottonwood thinleaf alder water birch and mountain maple grow with shrubs including chokeberry and willows
riparian areas in largely treeless habitats such as sagebrush steppe primarily consist of willows along with thinleaf alder chokecherry mountain maple shrubby cinquefoil fireweed saxifrage and grasses
the most common large animals are mule deer and elk but other mammals present include moose black bears pronghorn mountain lions coyote bobcat yellow @-@ bellied marmot beaver and gray wolves
gray wolves are top predators that were reintroduced amidst controversy to central idaho in the mid @-@ <num> to restore ecosystem stability
the wolves have since expanded their range and established packs in most of boise national forest
wolves and mountain lions are the forest 's top large mammal predators and have no predators of their own except humans
most of the forest 's native mammal species are present in the forest with the exception of grizzly bears which have become locally extinct and plans for their reintroduction to central idaho have been proposed since the <num> but have not progressed
of the <num> fish species present in the forest <num> are not native and have been introduced by humans
rainbow trout chinook salmon westslope cutthroat trout bull trout and mountain whitefish are all native to some of the forest 's waterways while brook trout are a common invasive species that compete with the forest 's salmonids
the forest 's management indicator species is bull trout because they are sensitive to habitat changes and depend on specific habitat conditions
sockeye salmon are native to the salmon river watershed in the northern part of the forest but dam construction on the columbia and snake rivers has hampered the migration of this anadromous fish and caused its population to collapse
warm lake supports the forest 's only native population of kokanee salmon the resident non @-@ migratory form of sockeye salmon
however due to introductions by humans anderson ranch arrowrock lucky peak and deadwood reservoirs now support populations of kokanee salmon
to provide additional recreational fishing opportunities the idaho department of fish and game stocks several of the forest 's waterways with rainbow trout while reservoirs are also stocked with kokanee or chinook salmon and lake cascade is stocked with coho salmon and steelhead the anadromous form of rainbow trout
over <num> bird species have been observed in central idaho including <num> accidental species – those that are not normally found in the region but have been observed on at least one occasion
golden eagles and greater sage @-@ grouse can be found over sagebrush steppe whereas bald eagles can be seen along rivers
the forest service has listed northern goshawks flammulated owls and white @-@ headed woodpeckers as a sensitive species in the forest
the few amphibians present in the forest include the rocky mountain tailed frog long @-@ toed salamander and columbia spotted frog which has been listed as a sensitive species
common snakes include bullsnakes garter snakes and rubber boas
however previous management strategies as recently as the <year> forest plan treated fire as an undesirable process and the organic act of <year> explicitly stated that forests were to be protected from destruction by fire
in historic conditions fires naturally occurred on the landscape the suppression of fires allowed dead trees to accumulate in excess of historic levels and land cover types to change such as a shift to higher shrub and tree densities
an estimated <num> percent of the land in boise national forest has been affected by fires since the early <num> and about <num> percent of the land capable of timber production was burned so severely that land cover shifted from forest to grass and shrubland as of <year>
between <year> and <year> an average of <num> @,@ <num> acres <num>
<num> km2 were burned by fires per year with a maximum of <num> @,@ <num> acres <num> @,@ <num> km2 in <year> and a minimum of <num> acres <num>
<num> km2 in <year>
for example in <year> there were <num> fires started by people and <num> started by lightning which together burned a total of <num> @,@ <num> acres <num> km2
the trinity ridge fire alone burned <num> @,@ <num> acres <num> km2 over two months although it was not confined to boise national forest lands
the revised <year> forest plan recognized the need to develop plans to manage wildfires at the wildland – urban interface use prescribed fire as a tool to manage ecosystem health and meet air quality requirements set by the clean air act
the forest operates a fire management plan under federal fire policy that gives fire personnel direction for responding to unintended ignitions
occasionally area closures and restrictions on use such as prohibition of campfires are implemented to aid in wildfire prevention
following severe fires area closures may be put in place to protect the public from risks such as falling trees and landslides
proactive fire management strategies include prescribed burns and mechanical reduction of fuel levels
for instance in <year> boise national forest planned to conduct <num> @,@ <num> acres <num>
<num> km2 of prescribed burns and <num> acres <num>
<num> km2 of mechanical treatment
the forest seasonally maintains staff at seven fire lookout towers while six others remain unstaffed

the payette river scenic byway is an <num> @-@ mile <num> km route between eagle and mccall on idaho state highway <num>
the route follows the payette river between mccall and horseshoe bend but the majority of the highway does not pass through boise national forest only a small portion north of horseshoe bend is in the emmett ranger district
over half of the <num> @-@ mile <num> km wildlife canyon scenic byway which travels between highway <num> and lowman passes through the forest parallels the south fork of the payette river and is signed as the banks @-@ lowman road
the ponderosa pine scenic byway is a <num> @-@ mile <num> km road between stanley and boise following idaho state highway <num>
this route passes over arrowrock reservoir and through idaho city and lowman where it connects with the wildlife canyon byway

he later decided that explaining the story to chiranjeevi talking him into accepting the role and filming the movie would be a long tiring process
he chose instead to revive the script of uttam singh s o suryanarayana which he had written during the production of badri <year>
he approached pawan kalyan to play the lead role but he declined it
later he approached ravi teja who agreed to play the lead nagendra babu was to produce the film
however teja was approached by cheran an award winning director to remake the <year> tamil film autograph in telugu
teja was eager to be involved in the remake as he liked the original very much
as a result the production uttam singh s o suryanarayana was temporarily shelved
jagannadh meanwhile directed and produced <num> <year>
teja had backed out of participating in it citing scheduling conflicts with other existing commitments
jagannadh wanted to experiment by casting sonu sood in the lead role but this too failed to materialise
on <num> november <year> jagannadh met mahesh babu at the taj hotel in hyderbad to outline the film 's plot
it told the story of uttam singh an undercover police officer infiltrating a mafia gang as a criminal with the intention of killing its kingpin
mahesh liked the script but suggested jagannadh tweak the script 's backdrop to suit the telugu @-@ speaking peoples sensibilities
jagannadh agreed and also replaced the existing title with pokiri
mahesh wanted the film 's production to begin in <year> allowing him to complete his current commitments
while he waited for mahesh jagannadh directed akkineni nagarjuna in super <year>
while reworking the script jagannadh took inspiration from marana mrudangam <year> and state rowdy <year>
pokiri was produced jointly by jagannadh and manjula ghattamaneni 's production companies vaishno academy and indira productions respectively on a budget of ₹ <num> — <num> million
he used a new wardrobe and the same pair of shoes throughout the film
jagannadh wanted to cast ayesha takia as the female lead
due to a last minute change the makers opted to replace takia and considered several actresses including deepika padukone
jagannadh approached parvati melton to play the female lead
she declined the offer because at that time her parents were against her decision to become an actress
he also approached kangana ranaut who could not accept the role because of scheduling conflicts with the filming of her scenes in gangster <year>
after seeing stills of ileana d 'cruz in her telugu debut devadasu <year> jagannadh signed her as the female lead since he needed a girl who looked like a teenager to play the role of the aerobics teacher
prakash raj and ashish vidyarthi were cast as the film 's primary antagonists
raj played a mafia kingpin and vidyarthi played a corrupt police officer a villain 's role he finds more fun to play than that of a hero
sayaji shinde and nassar played the two other principal characters in the film
jyothi rana played the role of the mafia kingpin 's moll marking her debut in telugu cinema
isai and subbaraju portrayed negative roles as well with the former also making his debut in telugu cinema
ali played the role of a beggar and shared screen @-@ space with brahmanandam and venu madhav

shyam k
naidu was the film 's cinematographer and marthand k
venkatesh its editor
chinna and krishna were the film 's art director and executive producer respectively
most of the scenes were shot in a single take though it took time for mahesh to adjust to jagannadh 's style of filmmaking
chennai @-@ based stylist chaitanya rao designed the costume styling for mahesh and d 'cruz
by late february <year> eighty percent of the film shoot had been completed with the film 's climax and two songs remaining
this made it mahesh 's fastest shot telugu film with him in the lead role
the song gala gala was shot in the province of phuket in thailand and the city of bangkok
prior to the filming of the song jagadame shyam k
naidu was busy on the set of munna <year> and was unable to shoot it so cinematographer k
v
guhan who had worked on mahesh 's athadu <year> was recruited instead
the film 's climax sequences were shot in march <year> at the defunct binny mills located in chennai under the supervision of fefsi vijayan
he suggested that jagannadh include a scene where prakash raj fails to hear anything for a while after he is hit by mahesh during the climax sequence
mahesh stated in an interview that he had to shoot the film 's climax and two songs continuously for thirty @-@ eight days adding that he had to visit a hospital to be treated for shoulder pain
during the shooting of an underwater sequence a few electrical lights were used
the electricians changed the lines creating a short circuit which resulted in the death of one of the unit members
mahesh had gotten out of the pool two seconds before the accident happened which he termed a miracle
jagannadh wanted sharma to compose six songs with two duets between the lead pair three solo numbers by the male lead and an item number
during the shoot of sivamani <year> jagannadh listened to the song listen to the falling rain which sounded like the song gala gala parutunna godarila from the telugu film gowri <year>
he later came to learn that the latter song was inspired by the former and he decided to reuse the same tune with modernised instruments and different lyrics
sharma was accused of copying the tune of the song jaleo composed by ricky martin for the song devuda sung by naveen
the film 's soundtrack marketed by aditya music was released on <num> april <year> at hotel viceroy in hyderabad with mahesh 's father krishna attending the event as the guest of honour
sify called the soundtrack a peppy one and chose gala gala as the pick of the album
indiaglitz called it a run of the mill album that lacks freshness
the reviewer chose devuda gala gala and ippatikinka as the picks of the album rating each <num>
<num> out of <num>
cinegoer rated the soundtrack <num> out of <num> stars and stated the first time you hear pokiri the sound of it is good it doesn 't start to grow on you after a while but a few of the numbers are hummable and ring in your ears calling it a mixed bag for mani sharma
the reviewer chose dole dole and gala gala as the picks of the album rating each <num>
<num> out of <num>
due to delays in post @-@ production activities the film 's release was postponed to <num> april <year> clashing with the release of bangaram and veerabhadra
the film received an a adults only certificate from the central board of film certification for containing obscene sequences and excessive violence
dil raju 's sri venkateswara creations mallikharjuna films and great india films acquired the theatrical distribution rights of nizam ceded and overseas regions respectively
pokiri was one of the fourteen southern indian films that were screened at the iifa film festival <year> held at the dubai international convention centre in dubai united arab emirates
nevertheless it 's mahesh babu 's show all the way
regarding mahesh 's performance in the film y
sunita chowdary of the hindu wrote mahesh 's understated performance in pokiri allows him to effortlessly reclaim the title of a star overshadowing more questionable recent career choices
sify stated that pokiri was designed as a mass masala extravaganza which satisfies the undemanding viewers
the reviewer added that mahesh 's screen presence works to the advantage of the film
rediff stated sporting a new rugged look prince mahesh babu has stolen the show
he carries the film on his shoulders consolidating his winning streak after last year 's athadu
another highlight of the film is its well @-@ choreographed action sequences if you can digest the violence which give it a slick look
indiaglitz gave a positive review stating in pokiri the hero is introduced to us a ruthless baddie part of the huge underbelly of mafia
by the time we come to the denouement there is much twist and turn
if you like some racy action fun glamour and love then pokiri would be your kind of film
pokiri was released in a single screen the jayaprada theatre in chennai where <num>
<num> of seats were sold putting it in second place in the city 's box office chart which sify called an awesome feat

d
sridhar featuring darshan and pranitha subhash in the lead roles
the sequences featuring brahmanandam as a software engineer the comedy track of ali and brahmanandam mahesh asking d 'cruz to give him upma at the railway station were acclaimed
the fashion trend of wearing doctor sleeves increased in andhra pradesh after mahesh sported them and they continue to influence fashion even today
after the film 's release many films were released subsequently that had titles bordering on cuss words including jagannadh 's next film desamuduru <year>
mahesh revealed that he became confused after the film 's success it was such a huge hit that if someone came to me with a script i would approach the result of the film before approaching the character
i only wanted to act in movies that were like pokiri i think that was a mistake

time and again something has gone wrong
sakhir is one of those circuits where i really want to win

in the opening two races massa came under fire from the press for two errors that left him without points a collision with red bull driver david coulthard in australia and his spin at malaysia
massa promised that the first two races would not be indicative of the rest of the season it was not the start to the season that i wanted but there are still <num> races to go and <num> points up for grabs
in the next few races i plan to get back all the points i have lost in the opening two rounds
hamilton won the opening race in australia but managed to finish only fifth after a qualifying penalty and a botched pit stop in malaysia
the season began well for kubica as he qualified second in australia and finished second in malaysia
kubica predicted his team could maintain their momentum into the third race i 'm confident that we can be very competitive here as well
a week before the start of the grand prix weekend the news of the world alleged that max mosley the president of formula one 's governing body the fédération internationale de l 'automobile fia had engaged in sexual acts with five prostitutes
while mosley denied the allegations he cancelled his scheduled appearance at the bahrain grand prix

we are leading the championship which is the main thing and we know that we have the speed once we get everything right
the race was quite difficult but anyhow i am happy with second
kubica said that his poor start was due to wheelspin off the line and the presence of oil on the track impeded the performance of his car leading to räikkönen 's pass but anyway i think it was a good result third and fourth for the team and leading the constructors championship so it was good weekend
hamilton accepted responsibility for his near stall on the grid i hadn 't hit the switch early enough and therefore we were not in the launch map and went straight into anti @-@ stall and when everyone else was in their launch mode i wasn 't
renault dismissed suggestions that alonso had brake tested hamilton in the incident that led to the mclaren 's wing breaking off
pat symonds renault 's head of engineering said his team 's telemetry indicated alonso was on full throttle down the straight and had not touched the brakes i think all i can say from our side is that there is no blame attributable to fernando which is what some of the speculation might be
mclaren f1 ceo martin whitmarsh said that hamilton 's front wing had broken seconds before the impact and that the resulting downforce reduction had sucked hamilton into alonso 's slipstream faster than expected
however photos indicate that the front wing on the mclaren could have broken even earlier when hamilton nudged a car believed to be alonso on the opening lap
the later incident left alonso with damage to the back of the car impairing his attempts to pass glock late in the race

it was constructed between <year> and <year> during the great depression and was dedicated on september <num> <year> by president franklin d
roosevelt
its construction was the result of a massive effort involving thousands of workers and cost over one hundred lives
the dam was controversially named after president herbert hoover
since about <year> the black canyon and nearby boulder canyon had been investigated for their potential to support a dam that would control floods provide irrigation water and produce hydroelectric power
in <year> congress authorized the project
the winning bid to build the dam was submitted by a consortium called six companies inc
which began construction on the dam in early <year>
such a large concrete structure had never been built before and some of the techniques were unproven
the torrid summer weather and lack of facilities near the site also presented difficulties
nevertheless six companies turned over the dam to the federal government on march <num> <year> more than two years ahead of schedule
hoover dam impounds lake mead the largest reservoir in the united states by volume
the dam is located near boulder city nevada a municipality originally constructed for workers on the construction project about <num> mi <num> km southeast of las vegas nevada
the dam 's generators provide power for public and private utilities in nevada arizona and california
hoover dam is a major tourist attraction nearly a million people tour the dam each year
the heavily travelled u
s
<num> ran along the dam 's crest until october <year> when the hoover dam bypass opened
an initial attempt at diverting the river for irrigation purposes occurred in the late <num> when land speculator william beatty built the alamo canal just north of the mexican border the canal dipped into mexico before running to a desolate area beatty named the imperial valley
though water from the imperial canal allowed for the widespread settlement of the valley the canal proved expensive to maintain
after a catastrophic breach that caused the colorado river to fill the salton sea the southern pacific railroad spent <num> million in <year> – <num> to stabilize the waterway an amount it hoped vainly would be reimbursed by the federal government
even after the waterway was stabilized it proved unsatisfactory because of constant disputes with landowners on the mexican side of the border
as the technology of electric power transmission improved the lower colorado was considered for its hydroelectric @-@ power potential
in <year> the edison electric company of los angeles surveyed the river in the hope of building a <num> @-@ foot <num> m rock dam which could generate <num> @,@ <num> horsepower <num> @,@ <num> kw
however at the time the limit of transmission of electric power was <num> miles <num> km and there were few customers mostly mines within that limit
edison allowed land options it held on the river to lapse — including an option for what became the site of hoover dam
in the following years the bureau of reclamation bor known as the reclamation service at the time also considered the lower colorado as the site for a dam
service chief arthur powell davis proposed using dynamite to collapse the walls of boulder canyon <num> miles <num> km north of the eventual dam site into the river
the river would carry off the smaller pieces of debris and a dam would be built incorporating the remaining rubble
in <year> after considering it for several years the reclamation service finally rejected the proposal citing doubts about the unproven technique and questions as to whether it would in fact save money
the report was principally authored by davis and was called the fall @-@ davis report after interior secretary albert fall
the fall @-@ davis report cited use of the colorado river as a federal concern because the river 's basin covered several states and the river eventually entered mexico
though the fall @-@ davis report called for a dam at or near boulder canyon the reclamation service which was renamed the bureau of reclamation the following year found that canyon unsuitable
one potential site at boulder canyon was bisected by a geologic fault two others were so narrow there was no space for a construction camp at the bottom of the canyon or for a spillway
the service investigated black canyon and found it ideal a railway could be laid from the railhead in las vegas to the top of the dam site
despite the site change the dam project was referred to as the boulder canyon project
with little guidance on water allocation from the supreme court proponents of the dam feared endless litigation
a colorado attorney proposed that the seven states which fell within the river 's basin california nevada arizona utah new mexico colorado and wyoming form an interstate compact with the approval of congress
such compacts were authorized by article i of the united states constitution but had never been concluded among more than two states
in <year> representatives of seven states met with then @-@ secretary of commerce herbert hoover
initial talks produced no result but when the supreme court handed down the wyoming v
colorado decision undermining the claims of the upstream states they became anxious to reach an agreement
the resulting colorado river compact was signed on november <num> <year>
legislation to authorize the dam was introduced repeatedly by representative phil swing r @-@ calif
and senator hiram johnson r @-@ calif
but representatives from other parts of the country considered the project as hugely expensive and one that would mostly benefit california
the <year> mississippi flood made midwestern and southern congressmen and senators more sympathetic toward the dam project
on march <num> <year> the failure of the st
francis dam constructed by the city of los angeles caused a disastrous flood that killed up to <num> people
as that dam was a curved @-@ gravity type similar in design to the arch @-@ gravity as was proposed for the black canyon dam opponents claimed that the black canyon dam 's safety could not be guaranteed
congress authorized a board of engineers to review plans for the proposed dam
the colorado river board found the project feasible but warned that should the dam fail every downstream colorado river community would be destroyed and that the river might change course and empty into the salton sea
the board cautioned to avoid such possibilities the proposed dam should be constructed on conservative if not ultra @-@ conservative lines
on december <num> <year> president coolidge signed the bill authorizing the dam
the boulder canyon project act appropriated <num> million for the hoover dam along with the downstream imperial dam and all @-@ american canal a replacement for beatty 's canal entirely on the u
s
side of the border
it also permitted the compact to go into effect when at least six of the seven states approved it
this occurred on march <num> <year> with utah 's ratification arizona did not approve it until <year>
officials eventually decided on a massive concrete arch @-@ gravity dam the design of which was overseen by the bureau 's chief design engineer john l
savage
the monolithic dam would be thick at the bottom and thin near the top and would present a convex face towards the water above the dam
the curving arch of the dam would transmit the water 's force into the abutments in this case the rock walls of the canyon
the wedge @-@ shaped dam would be <num> ft <num> m thick at the bottom narrowing to <num> ft <num> m at the top leaving room for a highway connecting nevada and arizona
on january <num> <year> the bureau made the bid documents available to interested parties at five dollars a copy
the government was to provide the materials but the contractor was to prepare the site and build the dam
the dam was described in minute detail covering <num> pages of text and <num> drawings
a <num> million bid bond was to accompany each bid the winner would have to post a <num> million performance bond
the contractor had seven years to build the dam or penalties would ensue
the wattis brothers heads of the utah construction company were interested in bidding on the project but lacked the money for the performance bond
they lacked sufficient resources even in combination with their longtime partners morrison @-@ knudsen which employed the nation 's leading dam builder frank crowe
they formed a joint venture to bid for the project with pacific bridge company of portland oregon henry j

as bechtel and kaiser were considered one company for purposes of <num> in the name
the name was descriptive and was an inside joke among the san franciscans in the bid where six companies was also a chinese benevolent association in the city
there were three valid bids and six companies bid of <num> @,@ <num> @,@ <num> was the lowest within <num> @,@ <num> of the confidential government estimate of what the dam would cost to build and five million dollars less than the next @-@ lowest bid
the city of las vegas had lobbied hard to be the headquarters for the dam construction closing its many speakeasies when the decision maker secretary of the interior ray wilbur came to town
instead wilbur announced in early <year> that a model city was to be built in the desert near the dam site
this town became known as boulder city nevada
construction of a rail line joining las vegas and the dam site began in september <year>
las vegas then a small city of some <num> @,@ <num> saw between <num> @,@ <num> and <num> @,@ <num> unemployed descend on it
a government camp was established for surveyors and other personnel near the dam site this soon became surrounded by a squatters camp
known as mckeeversville the camp was home to men hoping for work on the project together with their families
another camp on the flats along the colorado river was officially called williamsville but was known to its inhabitants as ragtown
when construction began six companies hired large numbers of workers with more than <num> @,@ <num> on the payroll by <year> and with employment peaking at <num> @,@ <num> in july <year>
mongolian chinese labor was prevented by the construction contract while the number of blacks employed by six companies never exceeded thirty mostly lowest @-@ pay @-@ scale laborers in a segregated crew who were issued separate water buckets
as part of the contract six companies inc
was to build boulder city to house the workers
the original timetable called for boulder city to be built before the dam project began but president hoover ordered work on the dam to begin in march <year> rather than in october
the company built bunkhouses attached to the canyon wall to house <num> single men at what became known as river camp
workers with families were left to provide their own accommodations until boulder city could be completed and many lived in ragtown
the site of hoover dam endures extremely hot weather and the summer of <year> was especially torrid with the daytime high averaging <num>
<num> ° f <num>
<num> ° c
sixteen workers and other riverbank residents died of heat prostration between june <num> and july <num> <year>
the industrial workers of the world iww or wobblies though much @-@ reduced from their heyday as militant labor organizers in the early years of the century hoped to unionize the six companies workers by capitalizing on their discontent
they sent eleven organizers several of whom were arrested by las vegas police
on august <num> <year> the company cut wages for all tunnel workers
although the workers sent away the organizers not wanting to be associated with the wobblies they formed a committee to represent them with the company
the committee drew up a list of demands that evening and presented them to crowe the following morning
he was noncommittal
the workers hoped that crowe the general superintendent of the job would be sympathetic instead he gave a scathing interview to a newspaper describing the workers as malcontents
on the morning of the <num> crowe met with the committee and told them that management refused their demands was stopping all work and was laying off the entire work force except for a few office workers and carpenters
the workers were given until <num> p
m
to vacate the premises
concerned that a violent confrontation was imminent most workers took their paychecks and left for las vegas to await developments
two days later the remainder were talked into leaving by law enforcement
on august <num> the company began hiring workers again and two days later the strike was called off
while the workers received none of their demands the company guaranteed there would be no further reductions in wages
living conditions began to improve as the first residents moved into boulder city in late <year>
a second labor action took place in july <year> as construction on the dam wound down
when a six companies manager altered working times to force workers to take lunch on their own time workers responded with a strike
emboldened by crowe 's reversal of the lunch decree workers raised their demands to include a <num> @-@ per @-@ day raise
the company agreed to ask the federal government to supplement the pay but no money was forthcoming from washington
the strike ended
to accomplish this four diversion tunnels were driven through the canyon walls two on the nevada side and two on the arizona side
these tunnels were <num> ft <num> m in diameter
their combined length was nearly <num> @,@ <num> ft or more than <num> miles <num> km
the contract required these tunnels to be completed by october <num> <year> with a <num> @,@ <num> @-@ per @-@ day fine to be assessed for any delay
to meet the deadline six companies had to complete work by early <year> since only in late fall and winter was the water level in the river low enough to safely divert
tunneling began at the lower portals of the nevada tunnels in may <year>
shortly afterward work began on two similar tunnels in the arizona canyon wall
in march <year> work began on lining the tunnels with concrete
first the base or invert was poured
gantry cranes running on rails through the entire length of each tunnel were used to place the concrete
the sidewalls were poured next
movable sections of steel forms were used for the sidewalls
finally using pneumatic guns the overheads were filled in
the concrete lining is <num> feet <num> m thick reducing the finished tunnel diameter to <num> ft <num> m
the river was diverted into the two arizona tunnels on november <num> <year> the nevada tunnels were kept in reserve for high water
this was done by exploding a temporary cofferdam protecting the arizona tunnels while at the same time dumping rubble into the river until its natural course was blocked
following the completion of the dam the entrances to the two outer diversion tunnels were sealed at the opening and halfway through the tunnels with large concrete plugs
the downstream halves of the tunnels following the inner plugs are now the main bodies of the spillway tunnels
the inner diversion tunnels were plugged at approximately one @-@ third of their length beyond which they now carry steel pipes connecting the intake towers to the power plant and outlet works
the inner tunnels outlets are equipped with gates that can be closed to drain the tunnels for maintenance
work on the upper cofferdam began in september <year> even though the river had not yet been diverted
the cofferdams were designed to protect against the possibility of the river flooding a site at which two thousand men might be at work and their specifications were covered in the bid documents in nearly as much detail as the dam itself
the upper cofferdam was <num> ft <num> m high and <num> feet <num> m thick at its base as thicker than the dam itself
it contained <num> @,@ <num> cubic yards <num> @,@ <num> <num> of material
when the cofferdams were in place and the construction site was drained of water excavation for the dam foundation began
for the dam to rest on solid rock it was necessary to remove accumulated erosion soils and other loose materials in the riverbed until sound bedrock was reached
work on the foundation excavations was completed in june <year>
during this excavation approximately <num> @,@ <num> @,@ <num> cu yd <num> @,@ <num> @,@ <num> <num> of material was removed
since the dam was an arch @-@ gravity type the side @-@ walls of the canyon would bear the force of the impounded lake
therefore the side @-@ walls were excavated too to reach virgin rock as weathered rock might provide pathways for water seepage
the men who removed this rock were called high scalers
while suspended from the top of the canyon with ropes the high @-@ scalers climbed down the canyon walls and removed the loose rock with jackhammers and dynamite
falling objects were the most common cause of death on the dam site the high scalers work thus helped ensure worker safety
one high scaler was able to save life in a more direct manner when a government inspector lost his grip on a safety line and began tumbling down a slope towards almost certain death a high scaler was able to intercept him and pull him into the air
the construction site had even then become a magnet for tourists the high scalers were prime attractions and showed off for the watchers
the high scalers received considerable media attention with one worker dubbed the human pendulum for swinging co @-@ workers and at other times cases of dynamite across the canyon
to protect themselves against falling objects some high scalers took cloth hats and dipped them in tar allowing them to harden
when workers wearing such headgear were struck hard enough to inflict broken jaws they sustained no skull damage six companies ordered thousands of what initially were called hard boiled hats later hard hats and strongly encouraged their use
the cleared underlying rock foundation of the dam site was reinforced with grout called a grout curtain
holes were driven into the walls and base of the canyon as deep as <num> feet <num> m into the rock and any cavities encountered were to be filled with grout
this was done to stabilize the rock to prevent water from seeping past the dam through the canyon rock and to limit uplift — upward pressure from water seeping under the dam
the workers were under severe time constraints due to the beginning of the concrete pour and when they encountered hot springs or cavities too large to readily fill they moved on without resolving the problem
a total of <num> of the <num> holes were incompletely filled
after the dam was completed and the lake began to fill large numbers of significant leaks into the dam caused the bureau of reclamation to look into the situation
it found that the work had been incompletely done and was based on less than a full understanding of the canyon 's geology
new holes were drilled from inspection galleries inside the dam into the surrounding bedrock
it took nine years <year> – <num> under relative secrecy to complete the supplemental grout curtain
since concrete heats and contracts as it cures the potential for uneven cooling and contraction of the concrete posed a serious problem
bureau of reclamation engineers calculated that if the dam was built in a single continuous pour the concrete would take <num> years to cool and the resulting stresses would cause the dam to crack and crumble
instead the ground where the dam was to rise was marked with rectangles and concrete blocks in columns were poured some as large as <num> ft square <num> m and <num> feet <num>
<num> m high
each five @-@ foot form contained a series of <num> @-@ inch <num> mm steel pipes through which first cool river water then later ice @-@ cold water from a refrigeration plant was run
when an individual block had cured and had stopped contracting the pipes were filled with grout
grout was also used to fill the hairline spaces between columns which were grooved to increase the strength of the joins
the concrete was delivered in huge steel buckets <num> feet high <num>
<num> m and almost <num> feet in diameter crowe was awarded two patents for their design
these buckets which weighed <num> short tons <num> t when full were filled at two massive concrete plants on the nevada side and were delivered to the site in special railcars
the buckets were then suspended from aerial cableways which were used to deliver the bucket to a specific column
as the required grade of aggregate in the concrete differed depending on placement in the dam from pea @-@ sized gravel to <num> @-@ inch or <num> cm stones it was vital that the bucket be maneuvered to the proper column
when the bottom of the bucket opened up disgorging <num> cu yd <num>
<num> <num> of concrete a team of men worked it throughout the form
although there are myths that men were caught in the pour and are entombed in the dam to this day each bucket only deepened the concrete in a form by an inch and six companies engineers would not have permitted a flaw caused by the presence of a human body
a total of <num> @,@ <num> @,@ <num> cubic yards <num> @,@ <num> @,@ <num> <num> of concrete was used in the dam before concrete pouring ceased on may <num> <year>
in addition <num> @,@ <num> @,@ <num> cu yd <num> @,@ <num> <num> were used in the power plant and other works
more than <num> miles <num> km of cooling pipes were placed within the concrete
overall there is enough concrete in the dam to pave a two @-@ lane highway from san francisco to new york
concrete cores were removed from the dam for testing in <year> they showed that hoover dam 's concrete has continued to slowly gain strength and the dam is composed of a durable concrete having a compressive strength exceeding the range typically found in normal mass concrete
hoover dam concrete is not subject to alkali – silica reaction asr as the hoover dam builders happened to use nonreactive aggregate unlike that at downstream parker dam where asr has caused measurable deterioration

the morning of the dedication it was moved forward three hours from <num> p

this was done because secretary of the interior harold l

eastern time
despite the change in the ceremony time and temperatures of <num> ° f <num> ° c <num> @,@ <num> people were present for the president 's speech in which he avoided mentioning the name of former president hoover who was not invited to the ceremony
to mark the occasion a three @-@ cent stamp was issued by the united states post office department — bearing the name boulder dam the official name of the dam between <year> and <year>
after the ceremony roosevelt made the first visit by any american president to las vegas
most work had been completed by the dedication and six companies negotiated with the government through late <year> and early <year> to settle all claims and arrange for the formal transfer of the dam to the federal government
the parties came to an agreement and on march <num> <year> secretary ickes formally accepted the dam on behalf of the government
six companies was not required to complete work on one item a concrete plug for one of the bypass tunnels as the tunnel had to be used to take in irrigation water until the powerhouse went into operation
the first was j

tierney a surveyor who drowned on december <num> <year> while looking for an ideal spot for the dam
ninety @-@ six of the deaths occurred during construction at the site
of the <num> fatalities <num> were six companies employees three were bor employees and one was a visitor to the site with the remainder employees of various contractors not part of six companies
not included in the official fatalities number were deaths that were recorded as pneumonia
workers alleged that this diagnosis was a cover for death from carbon monoxide poisoning brought on by the use of gasoline @-@ fueled vehicles in the diversion tunnels and a classification used by six companies to avoid paying compensation claims
the site 's diversion tunnels frequently reached <num> ° f <num> ° c enveloped in thick plumes of vehicle exhaust gases
a total of <num> workers were recorded as having died from pneumonia none were listed as having died from carbon monoxide poisoning
no deaths of non @-@ workers from pneumonia were recorded in boulder city during the construction period
the bureau of reclamation more concerned with the dam 's functionality adorned it with a gothic @-@ inspired balustrade and eagle statues
this initial design was criticized by many as being too plain and unremarkable for a project of such immense scale so los angeles @-@ based architect gordon b
kaufmann then the supervising architect to the bureau of reclamation was brought in to redesign the exteriors
kaufmann greatly streamlined the design and applied an elegant art deco style to the entire project
he designed sculptured turrets rising seamlessly from the dam face and clock faces on the intake towers set for the time in nevada and arizona — the two states are in different time zones but as arizona does not observe daylight saving time the clocks display the same time for more than half the year
at kaufmann 's request denver artist allen tupper true was hired to handle the design and decoration of the walls and floors of the new dam
true 's design scheme incorporated motifs of the navajo and pueblo tribes of the region
although some initially were opposed to these designs true was given the go @-@ ahead and was officially appointed consulting artist
with the assistance of the national laboratory of anthropology true researched authentic decorative motifs from indian sand paintings textiles baskets and ceramics
the images and colors are based on native american visions of rain lightning water clouds and local animals — lizards serpents birds — and on the southwestern landscape of stepped mesas
in these works which are integrated into the walkways and interior halls of the dam true also reflected on the machinery of the operation making the symbolic patterns appear both ancient and modern
with the agreement of kaufmann and the engineers true also devised an innovative color @-@ coding for the pipes and machinery which was implemented throughout all bor projects
true 's consulting artist job lasted through <year> it was extended so he could complete design work for the parker shasta and grand coulee dams and power plants
true 's work on the hoover dam was humorously referred to in a poem published in the new yorker part of which read lose the spark and justify the dream but also worthy of remark will be the color scheme
complementing kaufmann and true 's work the norwegian @-@ born naturalized american sculptor oskar j
w
hansen designed many of the sculptures on and around the dam
his works include the monument of dedication plaza a plaque to memorialize the workers killed and the bas @-@ reliefs on the elevator towers
in his words hansen wanted his work to express the immutable calm of intellectual resolution and the enormous power of trained physical strength equally enthroned in placid triumph of scientific accomplishment because t he building of hoover dam belongs to the sagas of the daring
hansen 's dedication plaza on the nevada abutment contains a sculpture of two winged figures flanking a flagpole
surrounding the base of the monument is a terrazzo floor embedded with a star map
the map depicts the northern hemisphere sky at the moment of president roosevelt 's dedication of the dam
this is intended to help future astronomers if necessary calculate the exact date of dedication
the <num> @-@ foot @-@ high <num>
<num> m bronze figures dubbed winged figures of the republic were each formed in a continuous pour
to put such large bronzes into place without marring the highly polished bronze surface they were placed on ice and guided into position as the ice melted
hansen 's bas @-@ relief on the nevada elevator tower depicts the benefits of the dam flood control navigation irrigation water storage and power
the bas @-@ relief on the arizona elevator depicts in his words the visages of those indian tribes who have inhabited mountains and plains from ages distant
a u @-@ shaped structure located at the downstream toe of the dam its excavation was completed in late <year> with the first concrete placed in november <year>
filling of lake mead began february <num> <year> even before the last of the concrete was poured that may
the powerhouse was one of the projects uncompleted at the time of the formal dedication on september <num> <year> — a crew of <num> men remained to finish it and other structures
to make the powerhouse roof bombproof it was constructed of layers of concrete rock and steel with a total thickness of about <num>
<num> feet <num>
<num> m topped with layers of sand and tar
in the latter half of <year> water levels in lake mead were high enough to permit power generation and the first three allis chalmers built francis turbine @-@ generators all on the nevada side began operating
in march <year> one more nevada generator went online and the first arizona generator by august
by september <year> four more generators were operating and the dam 's power plant became the largest hydroelectricity facility in the world
the final generator was not placed in service until <year> bringing the maximum generating capacity to <num> @,@ <num> megawatts at the time
original plans called for <num> large generators eight on each side of the river but two smaller generators were installed instead of one large one on the arizona side for a total of <num>
the smaller generators were used to serve smaller communities at a time when the output of each generator was dedicated to a single municipality before the dam 's total power output was placed on the grid and made arbitrarily distributable
the present contracts for the sale of electricity expire in <year>
before water from lake mead reaches the turbines it enters the intake towers and then four gradually narrowing penstocks which funnel the water down towards the powerhouse
the intakes provide a maximum hydraulic head water pressure of <num> ft <num> m as the water reaches a speed of about <num> mph <num> km h
the entire flow of the colorado river passes through the turbines
the spillways and outlet works jet @-@ flow gates are rarely used
the jet @-@ flow gates located in concrete structures <num> feet <num> m above the river and also at the outlets of the inner diversion tunnels at river level may be used to divert water around the dam in emergency or flood conditions but have never done so and in practice are only used to drain water from the penstocks for maintenance
following an uprating project from <year> to <year> the total gross power rating for the plant including two <num>
<num> megawatt pelton turbine @-@ generators that power hoover dam 's own operations is a maximum capacity of <year> megawatts
the annual generation of hoover dam varies
the maximum net generation was <num>
<num> twh in <year> and the minimum since <year> was <num>
<num> twh in <year>
the average power generated was <num>
<num> twh year for <year> @-@ <year>
in <year> the dam generated <num>
<num> twh
to lower the minimum power pool elevation from <num> @,@ <num> to <num> feet <num> to <num> m five wide @-@ head turbines designed to work efficiently with less flow will be online by <year>
due to lack of water the dam mostly provides power only during periods of peak demand
control of water was the primary concern in the building of the dam
power generation has allowed the dam project to be self @-@ sustaining proceeds from the sale of power repaid the <num> @-@ year construction loan and those revenues also finance the multimillion @-@ dollar yearly maintenance budget
power is generated in step with and only with the release of water in response to downstream water demands
lake mead and downstream releases from the dam also provide water for both municipal and irrigation uses
water released from the hoover dam eventually reaches several canals
the colorado river aqueduct and central arizona project branch off lake havasu while the all @-@ american canal is supplied by the imperial dam
in total water from the lake mead serves <num> million people in arizona nevada and california and supplies the irrigation of over <num> @,@ <num> @,@ <num> acres <num> @,@ <num> ha of land
in <year> congress passed a new statute which set power allocations from the dam from <year> to <year>
the powerhouse was run under the original authorization by the los angeles department of water and power and southern california edison in <year> the bureau of reclamation assumed control
in <year> congress enacted legislation extending the current contracts until <year> after setting aside <num> of hoover dam 's power for sale to native american tribes electric cooperatives and other entities
the new arrangement will begin in <year>
the spillway entrances are located behind each dam abutment running roughly parallel to the canyon walls
the spillway entrance arrangement forms a classic side @-@ flow weir with each spillway containing four <num> @-@ foot @-@ long <num> m and <num> @-@ foot @-@ wide <num>
<num> m steel @-@ drum gates
each gate weighs <num> @,@ <num> @,@ <num> pounds <num> @,@ <num> @,@ <num> kg and can be operated manually or automatically
gates are raised and lowered depending on water levels in the reservoir and flood conditions
the gates are unable to entirely prevent water from entering the spillways but are able to maintain an extra <num> ft <num>
<num> m of lake level
water flowing over the spillways drops dramatically into <num> @-@ foot @-@ long <num> m <num> @-@ foot @-@ wide <num> m spillway tunnels before connecting to the outer diversion tunnels and reentering the main river channel below the dam
this complex spillway entrance arrangement combined with the approximate <num> @-@ foot <num> m elevation drop from the top of the reservoir to the river below was a difficult engineering problem and posed numerous design challenges
each spillway 's capacity of <num> @,@ <num> cu ft s <num> @,@ <num> <num> s was empirically verified in post @-@ construction tests in <year>
the large spillway tunnels have been used only twice for testing in <year> and because of flooding in <year>
during both times when inspecting the tunnels after the spillways were used engineers found major damage to the concrete linings and underlying rock
the <year> damage was attributed to a slight misalignment of the tunnel invert or base which caused cavitation a phenomenon in fast @-@ flowing liquids in which vapor bubbles collapse with explosive force
in response to this finding the tunnels were patched with special heavy @-@ duty concrete and the surface of the concrete was polished mirror @-@ smooth
the spillways were modified in <year> by adding flip buckets which both slow the water and decrease the spillway 's effective capacity in an attempt to eliminate conditions thought to have contributed to the <year> damage
the <year> damage also due to cavitation led to the installation of aerators in the spillways
tests at grand coulee dam showed that the technique worked in principle
s
route <num>
in the wake of the september <num> <year> terrorist attacks authorities expressed security concerns and the hoover dam bypass project was expedited
pending the completion of the bypass restricted traffic was permitted over hoover dam
some types of vehicles were inspected prior to crossing the dam while semi @-@ trailer trucks buses carrying luggage and enclosed @-@ box trucks over <num> ft <num> m long were not allowed on the dam at all and were diverted to u
s
route <num> or nevada state routes <num> <num>
the four @-@ lane hoover dam bypass opened on october <num> <year>
it includes a composite steel and concrete arch bridge the mike o 'callaghan – pat tillman memorial bridge <num> @,@ <num> ft <num> m downstream from the dam
with the opening of the bypass through traffic is no longer allowed across hoover dam dam visitors are allowed to use the existing roadway to approach from the nevada side and cross to parking lots and other facilities on the arizona side
hoover dam opened for tours in <year> after its completion but following japan 's attack on pearl harbor on december <num> <year> it was closed to the public when the united states entered world war ii during which only authorized traffic in convoys was permitted
after the war it reopened september <num> <year> and by <year> annual attendance had risen to <num> @,@ <num>
the dam closed on november <num> <year> and march <num> <year> days of mourning in remembrance of presidents kennedy and eisenhower
in <year> a new visitors center was built and the following year visits exceeded one million for the first time
the dam closed again to the public on september <num> <year> modified tours were resumed in december and a new discovery tour was added the following year
today nearly a million people per year take the tours of the dam offered by the bureau of reclamation
increased security concerns by the government have led to most of the interior structure being inaccessible to tourists
as a result few of true 's decorations can now be seen by visitors
the construction of the dam has been credited as causing the decline of this estuarine ecosystem
for six years after the construction of the dam while lake mead filled virtually no water reached the mouth of the river
the delta 's estuary which once had a freshwater @-@ saltwater mixing zone stretching <num> miles <num> km south of the river 's mouth was turned into an inverse estuary where the level of salinity was higher close to the river 's mouth
the colorado river had experienced natural flooding before the construction of the hoover dam
the dam eliminated the natural flooding which threatened many species adapted to the flooding including both plants and animals
the construction of the dam devastated the populations of native fish in the river downstream from the dam
four species of fish native to the colorado river the bonytail chub colorado pikeminnow humpback chub and razorback sucker are listed as endangered
the boulder canyon project act of <year> bcpa never mentioned a proposed name or title for the dam
the bcpa merely allows the government to construct operate and maintain a dam and incidental works in the main stream of the colorado river at black canyon or boulder canyon
when secretary wilbur spoke at the ceremony starting the building of the railway between las vegas and the dam site on september <num> <year> he named the dam hoover dam citing a tradition of naming dams after presidents though none had been so honored during their terms of office
wilbur justified his choice on the ground that hoover was the great engineer whose vision and persistence
has done so much to make the dam possible
one writer complained in response that the great engineer had quickly drained ditched and dammed the country
after hoover 's election defeat in <year> and the accession of the roosevelt administration secretary ickes ordered on may <num> <year> that the dam be referred to as boulder dam
ickes stated that wilbur had been imprudent in naming the dam after a sitting president that congress had never ratified his choice and that it had long been referred to as boulder dam
unknown to the general public attorney general homer cummings informed ickes that congress had indeed used the name hoover dam in five different bills appropriating money for construction of the dam
the official status this conferred to the name hoover dam had been noted on the floor of the house of representatives by congressman edward t
taylor of colorado on december <num> <year> but was likewise ignored by ickes
when ickes spoke at the dedication ceremony on september <num> <year> he was determined as he recorded in his diary to try to nail down for good and all the name boulder dam
at one point in the speech he spoke the words boulder dam five times within thirty seconds
further he suggested that if the dam were to be named after any one person it should be for california senator hiram johnson a lead sponsor of the authorizing legislation
roosevelt also referred to the dam as boulder dam and the republican @-@ leaning los angeles times which at the time of ickes name change had run an editorial cartoon showing ickes ineffectively chipping away at an enormous sign hoover dam reran it showing roosevelt reinforcing ickes but having no greater success
in the following years the name boulder dam failed to fully take hold with many americans using both names interchangeably and mapmakers divided as to which name should be printed
memories of the great depression faded and hoover to some extent rehabilitated himself through good works during and after world war ii
in <year> a bill passed both houses of congress unanimously restoring the name hoover dam
ickes who was by then a private citizen opposed the change stating i didn 't know hoover was that small a man to take credit for something he had nothing to do with
forming as a tropical depression out of a trough south of louisiana on august <num> the system moved generally westward
it was not until august <num> that the system began to organize
that day an eye rapidly formed within the system and it became a tropical storm just <num> mi <num> km southeast of galveston texas
soon thereafter a weather reconnaissance plane reported a barometric pressure of <num> mbar hpa <num>
<num> inhg at the storm 's center
around <num> <num> utc <num> <num> p

it subsequently made landfall near matagorda texas four hours later
once onshore gradual weakening ensued though a brief period of re @-@ organization delayed its dissipation
abby degenerated into an area of showers on august <num> southwest of san antonio texas
prior to abby 's landfall in texas gale warnings were issued for the coast and residents on matagorda island were evacuated
overall the storm 's impacts were limited due to its small size
only two structures sustained damage in matagorda one being destroyed by a possible tornado and the remaining effects resulted from flooding in jackson and victoria counties
total damage from the storm was estimated at <num> @,@ <num> with the majority stemming from crops
according to the atlantic hurricane database referred to as hurdat the system developed into a tropical depression by <num> <num> utc <num> <num> p

cdt that day with its center located roughly <num> mi <num> km south @-@ southeast of the mississippi river delta
moving generally west the system exhibited no signs of further development as it neared the texas coastline
however on august <num> radar images from brownsville galveston lake charles and victoria showed an abrupt increase in organization
during the afternoon hours banding features consolidated around a developing eye and weather reconnaissance planes were dispatched to the system
forecasters initially mistook the eye as a hook echo @-@ type feature at the end of a squall line
it is estimated that the depression became a tropical storm by <num> <num> utc <num> <num> a

operationally the system was not even monitored as a depression this time with the classification and naming of tropical storm abby occurring at <num> <num> utc <num> <num> a

abby was an unusually small storm with its entire circulation being far less than <num> mi <num> km in diameter
around <num> <num> utc <num> <num> a

cdt on august <num> reconnaissance measured a central barometric pressure of <num> mbar hpa <num>
<num> inhg within abby the lowest in relation to the system
they also reported peak winds of <num> mph <num> km h in squalls which would rank as a category <num> hurricane on the modern @-@ day saffir – simpson hurricane wind scale
these winds were seen to be an overestimate by forecasters and discarded however
the system attained its maximum winds of <num> mph <num> km h by <num> <num> utc <num> <num> p

irvin velbrecht a forecaster at the weather bureau now known as the national weather service in galveston described the storm as a perfectly miniature hurricane
despite moving onshore abby 's core continued to organize and it developed a closed eyewall roughly three hours later

according to irvin velbrecht in the absence of aircraft reconnaissance and radar information two reasonably new tools in storm detection abby could well have formed and approached the shore before knowledge of a tropical storm was gained
gale warnings were raised from galveston to san antonio immediately following the storm 's formation and were kept in place through the morning of august <num>

the hardest hit areas were in jackson and victoria counties where the heaviest rains fell
in these areas flooding and strong winds damaged the cotton and rice crops however effects of the rice crop were more limited due to losses from earlier storms as well as ongoing harvesting
some flooding also took place across the atascosa river watershed but no damage resulted
overall property damage was estimated at <num> @,@ <num> while agricultural losses reached <num> @,@ <num>
numbering about <num> men at its peak it was unique in the history of the rhodesian army as an exclusively expatriate unit
it existed between november <year> and may <year> as a company in the 1st battalion the rhodesia regiment and served two counter @-@ insurgency tours on operation hurricane in north @-@ eastern rhodesia today zimbabwe
during the bush war the rhodesian army augmented its ranks with foreign volunteers who were accepted into regular regiments with the same pay and conditions of service as locals
most foreign recruits enlisted in the rhodesian light infantry rli which launched an overseas recruitment programme in <year> but required successful applicants to speak good english
the army attempted to alleviate the strain on its troops during late <year> by recruiting french @-@ speakers as well and formed a designated company in the rhodesia regiment for them
the regiment already had six independent companies so the francophone unit became <num> independent company
the company 's men a mixture of former french paratroopers ex @-@ foreign legionnaires and young adventurers had trouble from the start integrating with the rhodesian forces and became unsettled by the respective ranks they were given in the rhodesian army
in an attempt to raise their morale and create a strong esprit de corps the army issued them beret insignias backed with the french tricolour and allowed them to raise the flag of france alongside that of rhodesia each morning
apparently under the impression that they had signed up as highly paid mercenaries many of the french troopers returned home after their first bush trip unhappy to have received no more money than a regular rhodesian soldier
on operations their performance was generally below par but the frenchmen were involved in some successful actions during february and early march <year>
their oppressive treatment of the black villagers they encountered made them very unpopular in the operational area
the rhodesians quickly deemed the experiment a failure and following a series of disasters for the company during the latter part of its second tour including two friendly fire incidents and several fatalities it was disbanded in may <year>
forces led by one of its members bob denard later that month executed a coup d 'état in the comoros with french rhodesian and south african governmental support
britain and the united nations refused to recognise this and each imposed economic sanctions on rhodesia
meanwhile the country 's two most prominent communist @-@ backed black nationalist groups the zimbabwe african national union and the zimbabwe african people 's union mobilised their respective guerrilla armies the zimbabwe african national liberation army zanla and the zimbabwe people 's revolutionary army zipra for what they called the second chimurenga with the goal of overthrowing the government and introducing black majority rule
the rhodesian bush war was the result beginning in earnest on <num> december <year> when zanla attacked altena and whistlefield farms near centenary in the country 's north @-@ east
the rhodesian security forces launched operation hurricane in response and fought back strongly reducing the number of guerrillas active within the country to under <num> by december <year>
in the period october – november <year> they killed more nationalist fighters than in the previous two years combined
however a south african @-@ brokered ceasefire which the security forces respected and the insurgents ignored helped the nationalists to win back ground
by <year> there were <num> @,@ <num> guerrillas operating in rhodesia with several times that number in training abroad
the rhodesian army though mostly made up of local men also included some foreign volunteers who were integrated into regular units under the same salary and conditions of service
almost all of the foreigners served in the rhodesian light infantry rli a heliborne commando battalion with a glamorous international reputation
the rli initiated a major overseas recruitment drive in <year> targeting potential volunteers from europe oceania and the americas and requiring successful applicants to speak good english
this campaign was bearing considerable fruit by may <year> when the rli 's largest ever intake included more foreign volunteers than any before and the enlisting of men from overseas into the rli would increase yet further
by <year> – <num> there were around <num> @,@ <num> foreigners in the rhodesian forces
however the rhodesian army remained stretched and low on manpower
he proposed it to major @-@ general sandy maclean then the rhodesian army 's second @-@ in @-@ command while they were visiting france together
maclean relayed the idea to the general staff in salisbury which decided in late <year> to form a french battalion to alleviate the strain on its regular units
a rhodesian officer of french extraction cyril bernard warned his superiors strongly against the scheme but was ultimately himself sent to france to start the project
on the way he stopped in zurich switzerland where maclean gave him final approval for the operation and a budget of us <num> @,@ <num>
they resolved to recruit mainly in paris and lyon
bernard then entered france and renewed old connections from the french military academy at saint @-@ cyr
recruitment was carried out by a former french paratrooper roger bruni operating from an apartment on rue bachaumont in central paris
advertisements placed in newspapers such as france soir offered a job with a future abroad
minimum age <num> former non @-@ commissioned officers preferred
the body of men eventually assembled varied widely in terms of age background and experience but was based largely around ex @-@ paratroopers and former foreign legionnaires
the average age was about <num>
french @-@ speaking veterans of an assortment of african and middle eastern conflicts spanning the previous two decades successfully applied but past service did not prove a necessity some of the men accepted had no military experience
most of them spoke english only at a basic level if at all
once signed up each man was instructed to travel to switzerland where appropriate visas were swiftly procured from the south african embassy
in early november <year> the french recruits flew from zurich to johannesburg on a south african airways liner then to salisbury by air rhodesia
already in rhodesia waiting for the men were their leaders major roland de l 'assomption an ex @-@ officer of the french army 's crack <num> shock parachute regiment and a former officer of the gabonese president omar bongo 's guard and major mario la viola once a non @-@ commissioned officer in the foreign legion 's <num> parachute regiment
beneath them were the antillean captain toumi who became the first black officer in the regular rhodesian army as the unit 's second @-@ in @-@ command and colonel bob denard an infamous french soldier of fortune nicknamed le chien de guerre — the dog of war
according to an anonymous veteran of the unit it mostly comprised recently discharged servicemen from the french forces who were having trouble adapting to civilian life
they didn 't know how to do anything else only how to jump with a parachute and obey orders he explained and they liked that kind of thing
others he said were members of the political far right who had joined up to kill commies and blacks and some were criminals hoping to escape the attention of the french police
each signed on for two years
the french @-@ speaking unit was placed in the rhodesia regiment rr as an independent company
the rr already had six of these made up of rhodesians so the frenchmen became <num> independent company
the rhodesian army sought to forge a strong esprit de corps among the new recruits and to this end extended them several sentimental allowances for example morale amongst the frenchmen rose when they were informed that the rhodesian insignia on their berets would be backed with the french tricolour
in a similar vein their request for permission to raise the flag of france alongside that of rhodesia outside their headquarters each morning was approved
french @-@ speaking men already in the army were attached to the unit to act as interpreters and assist with coordination and tactical instruction
some of these were mauritians who by virtue of their upbringing spoke both english and french at a native @-@ like level
the company itself which numbered about <num> men was assigned headquarters near salisbury at cranborne barracks the home of the rhodesian light infantry
it was organised in the same manner as a standard rhodesian independent company the only exception being its exclusively francophone personnel
spirits were high during the unit 's brief training period as the men enjoyed playing sports observing the country scenery and experiencing the night @-@ life of the nearby capital
they were not adequately trained receiving only a basic medical examination a few days fitness training and a cursory explanation of proper conduct in the bush
they expressed surprise when instructed to paint stripes of camouflage green on their weapons and combat boots in the rhodesian fashion having never before heard of such a practice
the first dent to morale came after about a week when the volunteers were first issued ranks in the rhodesian army
in the eyes of some of the french @-@ speaking soldiers the ranks assigned appeared to have been chosen almost at random by their superiors and did not reflect their actual respective levels of training ability and experience
some men who considered themselves to have been overlooked began to have problems with discipline
the brazen attitude of most of the company 's soldiers jarred strongly with that of their rhodesian commanders who had high standards regarding presentation and dress which many of the frenchmen had little inclination to meet
after this passed without major incident the frenchmen were despatched to rusambo a camp in the chimanda tribal trust lands near rushinga about <num> kilometres <num> mi north @-@ east from the capital and less than <num> kilometres <num> mi from the border with mozambique
most insurgents in this area belonged to zanla
a company of men from the territorial force was already stationed at rusambo advised by a team of intelligence officers
sticks of four men three fn fal riflemen and an mag gunner would be sent out into the bush from rusambo for periods of up to two weeks equipped with a radio to communicate with the base
their task while in action was to seek out guerrillas by means of patrolling ambushing and operating observation and listening posts
once a group of insurgents was spotted the stick leader would report their positions rusambo would then alert the army and request a fireforce
if fireforce were available it would arrive and engage the cadres if not the stick in the field would have to handle the situation itself
at first men from <num> independent company were sent out in sticks mixed with the territorials but problems soon arose regarding proper regimen and the language barrier
when the frenchmen were then sent out alone their land rovers prominently flying the french flag the issue of language was resolved but that of indiscipline remained
though discretion was paramount if they were to observe enemy movements covertly and effectively the men of <num> independent company were found to have difficulty maintaining this and sometimes made careless mistakes which risked revealing their presence
moreover when investigations were made of local kraals marked tension soon arose between the frenchmen and the local black population the soldiers ignorance of english or shona made it very difficult for discussions to take place and according to other rhodesian units who came into contact with them the french soldiers took out their frustration on the villagers often using excessive force in their attempted interrogations
nyamahoboko police station received a report of a <num> independent company man raping a young tribeswoman in a dense thicket but did not act on it
according to one history of the rhodesia regiment it was indicated that the frenchmen had received instruction that all black people were to be regarded as terrorists
the rhodesian army quickly deemed the french experiment a failure
it reassigned <num> independent company in late november to marymount mission a small settlement to the east of rusambo where there was a minor police station
the number of patrols they would embark on was reduced
two of the company 's vehicles were ambushed by cadres between marymount and rusambo on <num> january <year> resulting in two men being injured one fatally so
a week later another truck was surprised on the same bush road resulting in one death and three serious casualties
the company was brought back from the bush four days later for rest and recuperation r r in salisbury
many of them became seriously disaffected when they first received their salary from the rhodesian army
having apparently been misled about wages of up to r <num> @,@ <num> per month ₣ <num> @,@ <num> by the french recruiters they were surprised to find that their basic monthly pay was actually r <num> ₣ <num> @,@ <num> the same as a regular rhodesian soldier
moreover some were upset that they had been paid in rhodesian dollars which because of the country 's international isolation could not easily be exchanged for foreign currencies
although it was not as much as they had been expecting one disenchanted veteran of the unit afterwards admitted that the tax @-@ exempt r <num> wage which came with a <num> special @-@ unit supplement was still more than enough money for them to live comfortably in salisbury during their time off
the pay dispute split the unit
about two thirds went on strike saying they would not return to action unless the army upped their wages and paid them in foreign currency
meanwhile some of the more contented frenchmen made steps to remain permanently buying cars and having their wives join them in salisbury
the army detained the strike 's ringleaders for insubordination
with neither side willing to budge — the army refused to give the strikers extra pay or special treatment saying this would contravene rhodesia 's policy not to engage mercenaries — the disaffected men were repatriated to france at their own request
the rhodesian army considered disbanding the unit altogether but persevered when major de l 'assomption convinced his superiors that his remaining men were still loyal and eager to continue serving
the company acquitted themselves well during this time but one of their number was badly injured in a motor accident
they returned to rusambo where the camp was now manned by the british south africa police bsap criminal investigation department and special branch guarded by a group of coloured and indian @-@ rhodesian soldiers
on <num> february the frenchmen spotted a group of seven cadres indoctrinating tribespeople at a local kraal and called up fireforce
the rli men who arrived killed four of the seven including one carrying detailed documents
the next day <num> independent company observed <num> guerrillas entering another kraal but this time the fireforce took too long to arrive
the french company took part in a large contact on <num> march fighting alongside an rli fireforce against <num> cadres <num> insurgents were killed in this contact without loss for the rhodesian army
soon after this two sticks from <num> independent company were despatched to marymount led by a deputy intelligence officer who began sending them out on more regular night patrols
the following months were a disaster for the locally based rhodesian forces first one stick fired on another causing an injury then a bsap land rover hit a mine killing two members of the french company
a further frenchman died in an ambush by insurgents before another friendly fire incident on <num> april <year> resulted in a fatality
on several occasions during this bush trip the area was frozen regular army units were confined to their camps while the selous scouts operated against the guerrillas
with morale amongst the frenchmen plummeting bringing their unit close to collapse its officers at rusambo frantically worked to keep it together
the company did not last much longer once back in salisbury for r r
soon after three of its troopers were placed in detention at llewellin barracks the unit was formally dissolved in may <year>
the only personnel retained by the army were the interpreters who were returned to their former units
the comoros subsequently became a key location for rhodesian sanction @-@ busting operations providing a convenient end @-@ user certificate for clandestine shipments of weapons and equipment bound for rhodesia in spite of the un embargo
south africa also under a un arms boycott because of apartheid received war materiel through the comoros in a similar fashion
some <num> independent company men became civilians in rhodesia which was reconstituted as zimbabwe in <year>
two of them gervais henri alfred boutanquoi and simon marc chemouil both former foreign legionnaires were executed in april <year> despite a late plea from french authorities for clemency having been found guilty of robbing and murdering richard kraft a karoi café owner
witness mangwende the zimbabwean minister of foreign affairs issued a statement clarifying that the execution was for the murder and unrelated to their earlier service as mercenaries during the time of the smith regime
he is the designer of the award @-@ winning games cloud flow flower and journey and is co @-@ founder of thatgamecompany
chen is from shanghai where he earned a bachelor 's degree in computer science with a minor in digital art and design
he then moved to the united states where he earned a master 's degree from the university of southern california 's interactive media division
while there he created cloud and flow and met fellow student kellee santiago
after a brief period at maxis working on spore he founded thatgamecompany with santiago and became the company 's creative director
the company signed a three @-@ game deal with sony computer entertainment and has sold flow flower and journey through the playstation network
as chen was born in a culture other than the culture he now lives in he tries to make games that appeal universally to all people
his goal with his games is to help video games mature as a medium by making games that inspire emotional responses in the player that other games are lacking
although he and thatgamecompany can and have made more traditional games he does not plan on commercially developing any of them as he does not think that it fits with their goals as an independent video game developer
his parents were a middle @-@ class family and his father worked in the software development industry having previously worked on one of the earliest giant computers in china
although chen was interested in art and drawing as a young child his father influenced him towards computers entering him in programming contests from when he was <num> years old
he found himself interested in video games that he saw there but was not as enthusiastic about programming
while a teenager he had deep emotional experiences with games that he played including the legend of sword and fairy which he ascribes to the fact that he was not as exposed to books films or life events that other people would have had those experiences with
these experiences drove him to try to create those types of feelings in games as an adult when more emotional maturity had caused his standards to rise in what would move him in a game
it was during high school that he chose the english name jenova after a character in final fantasy vii wanting a name that would be unique anywhere he used it as there were thousands of jason chens
he earned a degree in computer science engineering in shanghai jiao tong university which due to his background in computers he found quite easy but describes himself as spending much of his time there teaching himself digital art and animation and later did a minor in digital art and design at donghua university
still interested in video games he was involved in making three video games as part of a student group while in school
upon graduating he had trouble finding a job in the chinese video game industry that combined his interests of engineering art and design and additionally felt that very few games had actually achieved those qualities that would be interesting to an adult
he also considered working in digital animation for films
he then went to the united states to earn a master 's degree in the school of cinematic arts at the university of southern california
chen studied in the interactive media program a new division of the school of cinematic arts
his intention at the time was to use the degree to get the kind of job he wanted back in china
at usc he became inspired when he went to the game developers conference where he positively compared the games he had made in college with the student work present at the independent games festival portion of the conference
while at usc he met kellee santiago another student in the same program and the two decided to work together on games that would be outside of the mainstream
their first game which won a grant of twenty thousand dollars from usc to produce was cloud released in <year> which focuses on a young hospital patient who soars in his mind despite being trapped indoors
the idea was partially based on himself as when he was a child he was often hospitalized for asthma
it was designed as an attempt to expand the spectrum of emotions video games evoke
at a student showcase at the game developers conference chen and santiago showed the game to a representative from sony john hight saying that it was the first game in the zen genre
hight was interested though no deal was forthcoming
the game won the best student philosophy award at the slamdance guerilla games competition and a student showcase award at the independent games festival and was showcased on spike tv g4tv and cbs sunday
chen felt that the reason that cloud had been so warmly received was because the emotions it sparked in players were different than any other game available at the time and believed that it was his calling to make more games that changed what people saw video games as
chen went on to do his master 's thesis the following year in the concept of dynamic difficulty adjustment where the game adjusts how it reacts to the player based on the past and present actions of that player
chen illustrated his ideas with flow a flash game made with nicholas clark
the game involves the player guiding an aquatic microorganism through various depths of the ocean consuming other organisms and evolving in the process
it was released in march <year> it received <num> @,@ <num> downloads in its first two weeks and by july had been downloaded over <num> @,@ <num> times
a playstation <num> version was announced in may <year> as a downloadable game via the playstation store and was released in february <year>
a version for the playstation portable developed by supervillain studios was released in march <year>
flow became the most downloaded game on the playstation network in <year> and won best downloadable game at the game developers choice awards
after graduating chen and santiago formed their own game company thatgamecompany in los angeles where he still lives and signed a deal with sony for three playstation store games
the ps3 version of flow was the first and while it was in development chen worked for maxis on the game spore
upon flow 's release chen returned to thatgamecompany and began working on their second game
chen was the creative director in charge of the game while santiago was the producer and clark was the lead designer
the company ranged in size from six to nine people at varying stages of the game 's development
flower was intended by chen to primarily to provoke positive emotions in the player and to act as an emotional shelter
chen described the game as an interactive poem exploring the tension between urban and nature
he decided on a nature theme early in the development process saying that he had this concept that every playstation is like a portal in your living room it leads you to somewhere else
i thought wouldn 't it be nice if it was a portal that would allow you to be embraced by nature
chen designed the game around the idea that the primary purpose of entertainment products like video games was the feelings that they evoked in the audience and that the emotional range of most games was very limited
to make flower have the emotional spectrum that he wanted chen looked at the development process as creating a work of art rather than a fun game which would not provoke the desired emotions
in <year> during flower 's development chen was named to the mit technology review tr35 as one of the top <num> innovators in the world under the age of <num>
after flower was released to critical praise and awards chen and thatgamecompany moved on to their next game journey
journey was intended by chen to focus on the element of communication and social interaction in video games
since in most games the communication between players is focused on specific goals in journey chen intended for the player to be able to either play alone or to come across other players but not be able to communicate with them directly
instead players have to build relationships with each other through their actions helping each other or leaving as they choose
journey was released on the playstation network on march <num> <year> and has received critical acclaim
he also names final fantasy vii as an influence and the game that he took his adopted name from
he personally plays games competitively including titles such as street fighter iv and starcraft
he feels he has a competitive nature which he has turned towards winning at being a game designer by creating games that are unlike what is in the market rather than towards creating competitive games
as he was raised in china and works in america chen feels that he cannot fully relate to either culture as a game designer
as such instead of trying to make games that fit perfectly with one culture he tries to make games that tap into feelings that are universal and independent of culture
when chen quit maxis to re @-@ join thatgamecompany he did so knowing that it would mean taking less pay and having a less stable career
he felt though that it was important to the industry and medium as a whole to create games that provoked different emotional responses in the player than just excitement or fear
while chen is not opposed to making action games and his company has made internal exciting games that were well received at sony he feels that there is no point to thatgamecompany commercially producing games like that instead of working for existing game developers as they would not be making anything new that justified the cost of remaining an independent studio
similarly chen does not intend for thatgamecompany to make big budget blockbuster games as the pressure on profits that that entails would stifle the innovation that he wants thatgamecompany to focus on
chen believes that for video games to become a mature medium like film the industry as a whole needs to create a wide range of emotional responses to their games similar to how film has thriller romance and comedy genres based on the emotions they provoke
he feels that there are only three ways for video games to impact adults in the same way they do children intellectually whereby the work reveals a new perspective about the world that you have not seen before by emotionally touching someone and by creating a social environment where the intellectual or emotional stimulation could happen from other people

hornung ernest william hornung <num> june <year> – <num> march <year> was an english author and poet known for writing the a
j
raffles series of stories about a gentleman thief in late <num> @-@ century london
hornung was educated at uppingham school as a result of poor health he left the school in december <year> to travel to sydney where he stayed for two years
he drew on his australian experiences as a background when he began writing initially short stories and later novels
in <year> he wrote in the chains of crime which introduced raffles and his sidekick bunny manders the characters were based partly on his friends oscar wilde and his lover lord alfred douglas and also on sherlock holmes and dr
watson
the series of raffles short stories were collected for sale in book form in <year> and two further books of raffles short stories followed as well as a poorly received novel
aside from his raffles stories hornung was a prodigious writer of fiction publishing numerous books from <year> with a bride from the bush to his <year> novel the crime doctor
the first world war brought an end to hornung 's fictional output
his son oscar was killed at the second battle of ypres in july <year>
hornung joined the ymca initially in england then in france where he helped run a canteen and library
he published two collections of poetry during the war and then afterwards one further volume of verse and an account of his time spent in france notes of a camp @-@ follower on the western front
hornung 's fragile constitution was further weakened by the stress of his war work
to aid his recuperation he and his wife visited the south of france in <year>
he fell ill from influenza on the journey and died on <num> march <year> aged <num>
although much of hornung 's work has fallen into obscurity his raffles stories continued to be popular and have formed numerous film and television adaptations
hornung 's stories dealt with a wider range of themes than crime he examined scientific and medical developments guilt class and the unequal role played by women in society
two threads that run through a sizeable proportion of his books are australia and cricket the latter was also a lifelong passion
he was the third son and youngest of eight children of john peter hornung <year> – <num> and his wife harriet née armstrong <year> – <num>
john was christened johan petrus hornung in the transylvania region of hungary and after working in hamburg for a shipping firm had moved to britain in the <num> as a coal and iron merchant
john married harriet in march <year> by which time he had anglicised his name
at the age of <num> hornung joined st ninian 's preparatory school in moffat dumfriesshire before enrolling at uppingham school in <year>
hornung was well liked at school and developed a lifelong love of cricket despite limited skills at the game which were further worsened by bad eyesight asthma and according to his biographer peter rowland a permanent state of generally poor health
when hornung was <num> his health worsened he left uppingham and travelled to australia where it was hoped by his family that the climate would be beneficial
on his arrival he was employed as a tutor to the parsons family in mossgiel in the riverina south @-@ western new south wales
in addition to teaching he spent time working in remote sheep stations in the outback and contributing material to the weekly magazine the bulletin he also began writing what was to become his first novel
although he spent only two years in australia the experience was the making of him and
the making of his career as a writer according to rowland
another biographer mark valentine wrote that hornung seems to have regarded this period as one of the most satisfying of his life
from a position of relative prosperity john 's coal and iron business had encountered difficulties and he was in financially straitened circumstances by the time of his death
hornung found work in london as a journalist and story writer often publishing his work under a pseudonym although in <year> he published his first story under his own name stroke of five which appeared in belgravia magazine
his work as a journalist was during the period of jack the ripper and the series of five murders which were undertaken against a background of rising urban crime in london it was around this time that hornung developed an interest in criminal behaviour
hornung had worked on the novel manuscript he brought back from australia and between july and november <year> the story a bride from the bush was published in five parts in the cornhill magazine
it was also released that year as a book — his first
the story — described by rowland as an assured graceful comedy of manners — used hornung 's knowledge of australia as a backdrop and the device of an australian bride to examine british social behaviour the novel was well received by critics
in <year> hornung became a member of two cricket clubs the idlers whose members included arthur conan doyle robert barr and jerome k
jerome and the strand club
hornung knew doyle 's sister constance connie aimée monica doyle <year> – <year> whom he had met when he visited portugal
connie was described by doyle 's biographer andrew lycett as being attractive with pre @-@ raphaelite looks
the most sought @-@ after of the doyle daughters
by december <year> when hornung doyle and jerome visited the black museum at scotland yard hornung and connie were engaged and in <year> hornung dedicated his second novel tiny luttrell to c
a
m
d
they were married on <num> september <year> although doyle was not at the wedding and relations between the two writers were sometimes strained
the hornungs had a son arthur oscar in <year> while his first name was from doyle who was also arthur 's godfather the boy 's middle name was probably after doyle and hornung 's mutual friend oscar wilde and it was by his second name that he was known
in <year> doyle and hornung began work on a play for henry irving on the subject of boxing during the regency doyle was initially eager and paid hornung £ <num> as a down payment before he withdrew after the first act had been written the work was never completed
like hornung 's first novel tiny luttrell had australia as a backdrop and also used the plot device of an australian woman in a culturally alien environment
the australian theme was present in his next four novels the boss of taroomba <year> the unbidden guest <year> irralie 's bushranger <year> and the rogue 's march <year>
in the last of these hornung wrote of the australian convict transport system and showed evidence of a growing fascination with the motivation behind criminal behaviour and a deliberate sympathy for the criminal hero as a victim of events while irralie 's bushranger introduced the character stingaree an oxford @-@ educated australian gentleman thief in a novel that casts doubt on conventional responses to a positive criminal character according to hornung 's biographer stephen knight
later that year hornung and his wife visited italy for six months staying in posillipo his account of the location appeared in an article of the may <year> edition of cornhill magazine
the hornungs returned to london in early <year> to a house in pitt street west kensington where they lived for the next six years
the fictional character stingaree proved to be a prototype of a character hornung used in a series of six short stories published in <year> in cassell 's magazine a
j
raffles
the character was modelled on george cecil ives a cambridge @-@ educated criminologist and talented cricketer who like raffles was a resident of the albany a gentlemen 's only residence in mayfair
the first tale of the series in the chains of crime was published in june that year titled the ides of march
the stories were collected into one volume — with two additional tales — under the name the amateur cracksman which was published the following year
hornung used a narrative form similar to doyle 's sherlock holmes stories with raffles and his partner @-@ in @-@ crime and former school fag bunny manders being the criminal counterparts to holmes and dr
watson — although rowland writes that raffles and manders were also fictionalized versions of wilde and bosie wilde 's lover lord alfred douglas
— and he dedicated the stories to his brother @-@ in @-@ law to a
c
d
this form of flattery
doyle had warned against writing the stories and reflected in his memoirs that there are few finer examples of short @-@ story writing in our language than these though i confess i think they are rather dangerous in their suggestion
i told him so before he put pen to paper and the result has i fear borne me out
you must not make the criminal the hero
the book was a popular and financial success although some critics also echoed doyle 's fears
the reviewer in the spectator wrote that stern moralists would consider the book 's premise as a new ingenious artistic but most reprehensible application of the crude principles involved in the old @-@ fashioned hero @-@ worship of jack sheppard and dick turpin
the book ends with manders imprisoned and raffles apparently dead something that left the spectator reviewer expressing their satisfaction that this audaciously entertaining volume is not issued in a cheap form
it is emphatically a feat of virtuosity rather than a tribute to virtue
after publishing two novels dead men don 't tell tales in <year> and peccavi in <year> hornung published a second collection of raffles stories the black mask in <year>
the nearly broke manders is told to apply for the post of a nurse to an elderly invalid who then reveals himself to be raffles who as manders describes had aged twenty years he looked fifty at the very least
his hair was white there was no trick about that and his face was another white
the lines about the corners of the eyes and mouth were both many and deep
in the final story of the collection the knees of the gods raffles and manders enlist in the army to fight in the second boer war the story closes with manders wounded and raffles killed
the critics again complained about the criminal aspect the spectator declared this sort of book presents crime in a form too entertaining and attractive to be moral while the reviewer for the illustrated london news thought that hornung 's invention has obviously flagged
it is laughable in a sense which the author never intended to hear these burglars rant about the honour of old england
it is a pity that the man who wrote peccavi should stoop to this
in <year> hornung collaborated with eugène presbrey to write a four @-@ act play raffles the amateur cracksman which was based on two previously published short stories gentlemen and players and the return match
the play was first performed at the princess theatre new york on <num> october <year> with kyrle bellew as raffles and ran for <num> performances
in <year> after publishing four other books in the interim hornung brought back the character stingaree previously seen in irralie 's bushranger
later that year he responded to public demand and produced a third series of short raffles stories in a thief in the night in which manders relates some of his and raffles 's earlier adventures
the reviewer for the boston herald thought that the sentimental side of the story has never before been shown so dramatically and romantically and described the book as thrilling and exciting
hornung 's next book was published in <year> and was the final raffles story the full @-@ length novel mr
justice raffles the book was poorly received with the reviewer for the observer asking if hornung is perhaps a little tired of raffles and stating that it has not the magic or the go of the first raffles and there is no good in pretending that it has
during the course of the year he collaborated with charles sansom to write a play a visit from raffles which was performed in november that year at the brixton empress theatre london
hornung turned away from raffles thereafter and in february <year> published the camera fiend a thriller whose narrator is an asthmatic cricket enthusiast with an ironmaster father much as hornung was himself
the story concerned the attempts of a scientist to photograph the soul as it left the body
hornung followed this up with fathers of men <year> and the thousandth woman <year> before witching hill <year> a collection of eight short stories in which he introduced the characters uvo delavoye and the narrator gillon whom rowland considers to be reincarnations of raffles and bunny
hornung 's next work the crime doctor <year> marked the end of his fictional output
when britain entered the war against germany he volunteered and was commissioned into the essex regiment
he was killed at the second battle of ypres on <num> july <year> aged <num>
although heartbroken by the loss hornung was adamant that some good would come of it and he edited a privately issued collection of oscar 's letters home under the title trusty and well beloved released in <year>
around this time he joined an anti @-@ aircraft unit
in either <year> or <year> he joined the ymca and did volunteer work in england for soldiers on leave in march <year> he visited france writing a poem about his experience afterwards — something he had been doing more frequently since oscar 's death — and a collection of his war poetry ballad of ensign joy was published later that year
in july <year> hornung 's poem wooden crosses was published in the times and in september bond and free appeared
towards the end of the year he was accepted as a volunteer in a ymca canteen and library a short distance behind the front line
during his service in arras in february <year> he borrowed a staff car from a friend and visited his son 's grave near ypres before returning to the library in arras
hornung was concerned about support for pacifism among troops and wrote to his wife about it
when she spoke to doyle about the matter rather than discussing it with hornung he informed the military authorities
hornung was angered by doyle 's action and told him there was no need for him to butt in except for his own satisfaction
relations between the two men were strained as a result
hornung continued to work at the library until the german spring offensive in march overran the british positions and he was forced to retreat firstly to amiens and then in april back to england
he stayed in england until november <year> when he again took up his ymca duties establishing a rest hut and library in cologne
in <year> hornung 's account of his time spent in france notes of a camp @-@ follower on the western front was published
doyle later wrote of the book that there are parts of it which are brilliant in their vivid portrayal while hornung 's biographer alison cox described the book as one of the best records of the war as experienced on the front lines
that year hornung also published his third and final volume of poetry the young guard
he worked on a new novel but was hampered by poor health
his wife 's health was of even greater concern so in february <year> they took a holiday in the south of france to recuperate
he fell ill on the train with a chill that turned into influenza and pneumonia from which he died on <num> march <year> aged <num>
he was buried in saint @-@ jean @-@ de @-@ luz in the south of france in a grave adjacent to that of gissing
doyle returning from a spiritualist lecture tour of australia received the news in paris and travelled south in time for the funeral
when hornung had still been courting doyle 's sister doyle wrote that i like young willie hornung very much
he is one of the sweetest @-@ natured and most delicate @-@ minded men i ever knew
honouring him after his death doyle wrote that he was a dr
samuel johnson without the learning but with a finer wit
no one could say a neater thing and his writings good as they are never adequately represented the powers of the man nor the quickness of his brain
his obituarist in the times described him as a man of large and generous nature a delightful companion and conversationalist
much of hornung 's work fell out of favour as time passed rowland observed that all of hornung 's other works have been forgotten with the possible exception of stingaree but the cricketing cracksman continues to enthral
the idea of a criminal as a positive character was one of hornung 's legacies and twentieth @-@ century literary criticism states that critics have also interpreted raffles as a prototype of the antihero in modern crime fiction
the academic frank wadleigh chandler describing raffles 's death writes that all his creator 's attempts to portray him as a hero rather than an anti @-@ hero deservedly fail
valentine highlights one aspect of the stories was the mix of devilry and daring demonstrated by raffles in this respect he was a literary forerunner of the saint james bond and other insouciant types
the writer colin watson agrees and called hornung a precursor of ian fleming
the character continued in book form the writer philip atkey under the pseudonym barry perowne obtained permission from the hornung estate to continue the raffles stories and seven more novels followed between <year> and <year> with raffles transformed from a gentleman thief to a tough adventurer
perowne continued the series in <year> and <num> of his stories were published in the <year> volume raffles revisited
hornung 's original stories have undergone a number of reprints and when all the short stories were published in a single volume graham greene considered it a splendid idea
in <year> greene had written a play based on the raffles stories the return of a
j
raffles which premiered at the royal shakespeare company with denholm elliott as raffles
there were several raffles films made during hornung 's lifetime further films followed in the years after his death including raffles the amateur cracksman <year> with house peters sr
raffles <year> featuring ronald colman the return of raffles <year> with george barraud and raffles <year> starring david niven the last of these was a samuel goldwyn productions remake of their own <year> film which the academic victor e
neuburg called the most memorable portrayal of the character
the bbc has dramatised some of hornung 's raffles stories for radio first in the <num> and again in the <num> when nigel havers played raffles
in <year> anthony valentine played the thief and christopher strauli his partner in a yorkshire television series
a <year> tv version the gentleman thief adapted the stories for a contemporary audience with havers playing the lead
oliver edwards writing in the times considered that not the least attractive part of the raffles books is the simple plain unaffected language in which each one of them is written
the obituarist in the same newspaper agrees and thinks hornung had a power of good and clear description and a talent for mystery and surprise
colin watson also considers the point and observes that in hornung 's writing superfluous description has been avoided and account of action is to the point while doyle admired his sudden use of the right adjective and the right phrase something the writer and journalist jeremy lewis sees as a flamboyant kiplingesque taste for the vivid
critics have observed that hornung 's stories and novels are well @-@ structured
george orwell wrote that hornung was a very conscientious and on his level a very able writer
anyone who cares for sheer efficiency must admire his work
watson states that hornung 's writing has pace
the stories however ridiculous carry the readers along briskly
according to cox hornung 's work showed steady maturation during his career a point that doyle also agreed with although edwards disagrees and thinks the crime doctor to be one of hornung 's weaker books
hornung 's approach to characters differed from other contemporary authors
cox notes that hornung frequently chose to write from the perspective of the criminal and while many of hornung 's novels contained criminal activity as a major element of the plot the critic for contemporary authors states that the works do not belong to the crime @-@ fiction genre
hornung 's works included elements from more general fiction such as false identities disguises and disowned heiresses
the last category is based on raffles not being a member of society only being accepted because of his cricketing ability and associated fame
from this point raffles 's stealing from the rich is a rearguard action on behalf of the puritan values which was perceived as making up middle @-@ class values although rance also states that those values are obscured because of the changing boundaries between the classes
gariepy makes the same point and considers that raffles 's daring exploits and fantastic adventures symbolized the growing rebellion against victorian sensibility at the turn of the century
hornung kept abreast of scientific and medical developments and was keen to incorporate them into his stories which the critic for contemporary authors states shows hornung had a streak of modernity and decided interest in new ideas
the camera fiend uses the modern technology of the camera as an instrument central to the plot while the protagonist of the crime doctor uses psychology to identify criminals
throughout the raffles stories patriotism runs as an intermittent theme — to such an extent that the writer william vivian butler describes him as a super @-@ patriot
in the course of the short story a jubilee present raffles celebrating queen victoria 's diamond jubilee steals a gold cup from the british museum and sends it to the queen telling manders that we have been ruled over for sixty years by infinitely the finest monarch in the world
in the knees of the gods raffles volunteers for service in the second boer war changing his name and hair colour — he jokes to manders that he is prepared to dye for his country — and he later confesses his true identity to his superiors in order to unmask a spy
some of hornung 's novels including the shadow of the rope no hero and the thousandth woman are notable for portraying women in a rather modern favorable light according to the critic for contemporary authors showing concern for their unequal position in society
cox identifies a theme of guilt running through a number of works
among these is peccavi in which a clergyman lives his life trying to atone for an earlier crime shadow of the rope in which a woman is accused of her husband 's murder and the thousandth woman in which a woman stands by her lover after he is accused of murder
although hornung 's australian experience was brief it influenced most of his literary work from a bride from the bush published in <year> to old offenders and a few old scores which was published after his death
according to chandler nearly two @-@ thirds of hornung 's books refer in varying degrees to australian incidents and experiences with even raffles starting his criminal career in australia
some of horning 's works — such as a bride from the bush — were praised for their accuracy of detail in depicting the australian environment although the detail could overwhelm the storyline as in the rogue 's march
cricket was one of hornung 's lifelong passions and he was delighted to become a member of the marylebone cricket club in <year>
the sport also permeated his stories with raffles playing for the gentlemen of england
rance observes that raffles compares law @-@ breaking and cricket crime is reckoned as another and better sport
raffles does on occasion disparage his game commenting to manders in gentlemen and players where 's the satisfaction of taking a man 's wicket when you want his spoons valentine also considers the point and sees raffles 's cricket as a front for his criminal activities citing raffles 's praise for cricket for the glorious protection it affords a person of my proclivities
watson examines raffles 's actions within the broader context of sportsmanship with raffles acting within his own moral code of what is done and not done
orwell in his essay raffles and miss blandish observes that when raffles feels remorse it is almost purely social he has disgraced the old school he has lost his right to enter decent society he has forfeited his amateur status and become a cad
born in north carolina the sixth child of a preacher simone aspired to be a concert pianist
with the help of the few supporters in her hometown of tryon north carolina she enrolled in the juilliard school of music in new york
waymon then applied for a scholarship to study at the prestigious curtis institute of music in philadelphia where she was denied despite a well @-@ received audition
simone became fully convinced this rejection had been entirely due to her race a statement that has been a matter of controversy
years later two days before her death the curtis institute of music bestowed an honorary degree on simone
to make a living eunice waymon changed her name to nina simone
the change related to her need to disguise herself from family members having chosen to play the devil 's music or cocktail piano at a nightclub in atlantic city
she was told in the nightclub that she would have to sing to her own accompaniment and this effectively launched her career as a jazz vocalist
simone recorded more than forty albums mostly between <year> when she made her debut with little girl blue and <year> and had a hit in the united states in <year> with i loves you porgy
simone 's musical style fused gospel and pop with classical music in particular johann sebastian bach and accompanied expressive jazz @-@ like singing in her contralto voice

demonstrating a talent with the instrument she performed at her local church
but her concert debut a classical recital was given when she was <num>
simone later said that during this performance her parents who had taken seats in the front row were forced to move to the back of the hall to make way for white people
she said that she refused to play until her parents were moved back to the front and that the incident contributed to her later involvement in the civil rights movement
simone 's mother mary kate waymon <year> april <num> <year> was a methodist minister and a housemaid
simone 's father john divine waymon <year> october <num> <year> was a handyman who at one time owned a dry cleaning business but also suffered bouts of ill health
simone 's music teacher helped establish a special fund to pay for her education
subsequently a local fund was set up to assist her continued education
with the help of this scholarship money she was able to attend allen high school for girls in asheville north carolina
after her graduation simone spent the summer of <year> at the juilliard school preparing for an audition at the curtis institute of music in philadelphia
her application however was denied
as her family had relocated to philadelphia in the expectation of her entry to curtis the blow to her aspirations was particularly heavy and she suspected that her application had been denied because of racial prejudice
discouraged she took private piano lessons with vladimir sokoloff a professor at curtis but never re @-@ applied to the institution
for several years she worked a number of menial jobs and taught piano in philadelphia
in <year> she adopted the stage name nina simone
nina from niña meaning little girl in spanish and simone was taken from the french actress simone signoret whom she had seen in the movie casque d 'or
knowing her mother would not approve of playing the devil 's music she used her new stage name to remain undetected
simone 's mixture of jazz blues and classical music in her performances at the bar earned her a small but loyal fan base
in <year> she befriended and married don ross a beatnik who worked as a fairground barker but quickly regretted their marriage
playing in small clubs in the same year she recorded george gershwin 's i loves you porgy from porgy and bess which she learned from a billie holiday album and performed as a favor to a friend
it became her only billboard top <num> success in the united states and her debut album little girl blue soon followed on bethlehem records
simone lost more than <num> million in royalties notably for the <num> re @-@ release of my baby just cares for me and never benefited financially from the album 's sales because she had sold her rights outright for <num> @,@ <num>
colpix relinquished all creative control to her including the choice of material that would be recorded in exchange for her signing the contract with them
after the release of her live album nina simone at town hall simone became a favorite performer in greenwich village
by this time simone performed pop music only to make money to continue her classical music studies and was indifferent about having a recording contract
she kept this attitude toward the record industry for most of her career
simone married a new york police detective andrew stroud in <year>
he later became her manager and the father of her daughter lisa but he abused simone psychologically and physically
she had always included songs in her repertoire that drew upon her african @-@ american origins such as brown baby by oscar brown and zungo by michael olatunji in her album nina at the village gate in <year>
on her debut album for philips nina simone in concert live recording <year> for the first time she openly addressed the racial inequality that was prevalent in the united states with the song mississippi goddam her response to the june <num> <year> murder of medgar evers and the september <num> <year> bombing of the <num> street baptist church in birmingham alabama that killed four young black girls and partially blinded a fifth girl who survived
she remarked that the title and the song itself was like throwing <num> bullets back at them becoming one of many other protest songs written by simone
the song was released as a single and it was boycotted in certain southern states
specifically promotional copies were smashed by a carolina radio station and returned to simone 's record label
old jim crow on the same album addressed the jim crow laws
from then on a civil rights message was standard in simone 's recording repertoire becoming a part of her live performances
during the rise of her political activism the release of her musical work grew more infrequent
simone performed and spoke at many civil rights meetings such as at the selma to montgomery marches
simone advocated violent revolution during the civil rights period rather than martin luther king 's non @-@ violent approach and she hoped that african americans could by armed combat form a separate state
her message to the public signified the transition from the non @-@ violent approach to social change that was advocated by martin luther king into the more militant state that was implemented by malcolm x and the associates of the black nationalist movement
nevertheless she wrote in her autobiography that she and her family regarded all races as equal
simone moved from philips to rca victor during <year>

in the summer of <year> she performed at the harlem cultural festival in harlem 's mount morris park
together with weldon irvine simone turned the late lorraine hansberry 's unfinished play to be young gifted and black into a civil rights song
hansberry had been a personal friend whom simone credited with cultivating her social and political consciousness
she performed the song live on the album black gold 197gdjfhfhx0
a studio recording was released as a single and renditions of the song have been recorded by aretha franklin on her <year> album young gifted and black and by donny hathaway
however stroud interpreted simone 's sudden disappearance and the fact that she had left behind her wedding ring as an indication of a desire for a divorce
as her manager stroud was in charge of simone 's income
simone recorded her last album for rca it is finished in <year> and did not make another record until <year> when she was persuaded to go into the recording studio by cti records owner creed taylor
the result was the album baltimore which while not a commercial success was fairly well received critically and marked a quiet artistic renaissance in simone 's recording output
her choice of material retained its eclecticism ranging from spiritual songs to hall oates rich girl
four years later simone recorded fodder on my wings on a french label
during the <num> simone performed regularly at ronnie scott 's jazz club in london where she recorded the album live at ronnie scott 's in <year>

in <year> the original <year> recording of my baby just cares for me was used in a commercial for chanel no
<num> perfume in britain
this led to a re @-@ release of the recording which stormed to number <num> on the uk 's nme singles chart giving her a brief surge in popularity in the uk
when simone returned to the united states she learned that a warrant had been issued for her arrest for unpaid taxes as a protest against her country 's involvement with the vietnam war and returned to barbados to evade the authorities and prosecution

it depicts louis @-@ françois bertin <year> – <year> the french writer art collector and director of the pro @-@ royalist journal des débats
ingres completed the portrait during his first period of success having achieved acclaim as a history painter he accepted portrait commissions with reluctance regarding them as a distraction from more important work
bertin was a friend and a politically active member of the french upper @-@ middle class
ingres presents him as a personification of the commercially minded leaders of the liberal reign of louis philippe i
he is physically imposing and self @-@ assured but his real @-@ life personality shines through – warm wry and engaging to those who had earned his trust
the painting had a prolonged genesis
ingres agonised over the pose and made several preparatory sketches
the final work faithfully captures the sitter 's character conveying both a restless energy and imposing bulk
it is an unflinchingly realistic depiction of ageing and emphasises the furrowed skin and thinning hair of an overweight man who yet maintains his resolve and determination
he sits in three @-@ quarter profile against a brown ground lit from the right his fingers are pronounced and highly detailed while the polish of his chair reflects light from an unseen window
ingres portrait of bertin was a critical and popular success but the sitter was a private person
although his family worried about caricature and disapproved it became widely known and sealed the artist 's reputation
it was praised at the paris salon of <year> and has been influential to both academic painters such as léon bonnat and later modernists including pablo picasso and félix vallotton
today art critics regard it as ingres finest male portrait
it has been on permanent display at the musée du louvre since <year>
he befriended ingres either through his son édouard bertin a student of the painter or via étienne @-@ jean delécluze ingres friend and the journal 's art critic
in either case the genesis of the commission is unknown
bertin was a leader of the french upper class and a supporter of louis philippe and the bourbon restoration
he was a director of the le moniteur universel until <year> when the journal des débats became the recognised voice of the liberal @-@ constitutional opposition after he had come to criticize absolutism
he eventually gave his support to the july monarchy
the journal supported contemporary art and bertin was a patron collector and cultivator of writers painters and other artists
ingres was sufficiently intrigued by bertin 's personality to accept the commission
it was completed within a month during ingres frequent visits to bertin 's estate of retreat le château des roches in bièvres essonne
ingres made daily visits as bertin entertained guests such as victor hugo his mistress juliette drouet hector berlioz and later franz liszt and charles gounod
ingres later made drawings of the bertin family including a depiction of his host 's wife and sketches of their son armand and daughter @-@ in @-@ law cécile
the portrait of armand evidences his physical resemblance to his father
ingres early career coincided with the romantic movement which reacted against the prevailing neoclassical style
neoclassicism in french art had developed as artists saw themselves as part of the cultural center of europe and france as the successor to rome
romantic painting was freer and more expressive preoccupied more with colour than with line or form and more focused on style than on subject matter
paintings based on classical themes fell out of fashion replaced by contemporary rather than historical subject matter especially in portraiture
ingres resisted this trend and wrote the history painter shows the species in general while the portrait painter represents only the specific individual — a model often ordinary and full of shortcomings
from his early career ingres main source of income was commissioned portraits a genre he dismissed as lacking in grandeur
the success of his the vow of louis xiii at the <year> salon marked an abrupt change in his fortunes he received a series of commissions for large history paintings and for the next decade he painted few portraits
his financial difficulties behind him ingres could afford to concentrate on historical subjects although he was highly sought @-@ after as a portraitist
he wrote in <year> damned portraits they are so difficult to do that they prevent me getting on with greater things that i could do more quickly
ingres was more successful with female than male portraits
his <year> portrait of madame de senonnes was described as to the feminine what the louvre 's bertin is to the masculine
the sitter for his <year> portrait of baronne de rothschild looks out at the viewer with the same directness as bertin but is softened by her attractive dress and relaxed pose she is engaging and sympathetic rather than tough and imposing
he often took months to complete a portrait leaving large periods of inactivity between sittings
with bertin he agonised in finding a pose to best convey both the man 's restless energy and his age
at least seven studies survive three are signed and dated
ingres was a master draftsman and the sketches if not fully realised are highly regarded in their own right
the sketches are exemplary in their handling of line and form and similar in size
the earliest study has bertin standing and leaning on a table in an almost napoleonic pose
his hard level stare is already established but the focus seems to be on his groin rather than his face
it is obvious that ingres struggled with the sketch the head is on a square of attached paper which must have replaced an earlier cut @-@ out version and other areas have been rubbed over and heavily reworked
the next extant drawing shows bertin seated but the chair is missing
the last extant sketch is the closest to the eventual painting with a chair though his bulk has not yet been filled out
frustrated by his inability to capture his subject ingres broke down in tears in his studio in company
bertin recalled consoling him my dear ingres don 't bother about me and above all don 't torment yourself like that
you want to start my portrait over again take your own time for it
you will never tire me and just as long as you want me to come i am at your orders
after agreeing to a breathing spell ingres finally settled on a design
early biographers provide differing anecdotes regarding the inspiration for the distinctive seated pose
henri delaborde said ingres observed bertin in this posture while arguing politics after dinner with his sons
according to eugène emmanuel amaury duval he said was related to him by bertin ingres noticed a pose bertin took while seated outside with ingres and a third man at a café
bertin said that ingres confident that he had finally established the pose for the portrait came close and speaking almost in my ear said come sit tomorrow your portrait is as good as done
bertin 's final pose reverses the usual relationship between the two men
the artist becomes the cool detached observer bertin usually calm and reasoned is now restless and impatient mirroring ingres irritation at spending time on portraiture
his hair is grey verging on white his fingers spread across his knees
bertin 's fingers were described in <year> by artist henry de waroquier as crab @-@ like claws
emerging from the tenebrous caverns that are the sleeves of his coat
the bulk of his body is compacted in a tight black jacket black trousers and brown satin waistcoat with a starched white shirt and cravat revealing his open neck
he wears a gold watch and a pair of glasses in his right pocket
in the view of art historian robert rosenblum his nearly ferocious presence is accentuated by the tightly constrained space
the chair and clothes appear too small to contain him
his coiled stubby fingers rest on his thighs barely protruding from the sleeves of his jacket while his neck cannot be seen above his narrow starched white collar
the painting is composed in monochrome muted colours predominately blacks greys and browns
the exceptions are the whites of his collar and sleeves the reds in the cushion and the light reflecting on the leather of the arm @-@ chair
in <num> @-@ century art vivid colour was associated with femininity and emotion male portraiture tended towards muted shades and monochrome
bertin leans slightly forward boldly staring at the viewer in a manner that is both imposing and paternal
he seems engaged and poised to speak his body fully towards the viewer and his expression etched with certainty
influenced by nicolas poussin 's <year> self @-@ portrait with allegory of painting ingres minutely details the veins and wrinkles of his face
bertin is in three @-@ quarter profile against a gold – brown background lit from the right
he rests on a curved @-@ back mahogany chair the arms of which reflect light falling from the upper left of the pictorial space
ingres seems to have adapted elements of the approach and technique of hans holbein 's <year> portrait of william warham now in the louvre
neither artist placed much emphasis on colour preferring dark or cool tones
the warham portrait seems to have informed the indicators of bertin 's aging and the emphasis on his fingers
jacques @-@ louis david also explored hyper @-@ realism in his depictions of cooper penrose <year> and emmanuel joseph sieyès <year>
in the later painting david shows tiny glints of light reflecting on the sitter 's chair and painstakingly details every wayward curl of sieyès closely cropped auburn hair
the greek meander pattern at the foot of the wall is unusually close to the picture plane confining the sitter
the wall is painted in gold adding to the sense of a monumental portrait of a modern icon
the details of bertin 's face are highly symmetrical
his eyes are heavily lidded circled by oppositely positioned twists of his white collar the winds of his hair eyebrows and eyelids
his mouth turns downwards at the left and upwards to the right
this dual expression is intended to show his duality and complex personality he is a hard @-@ nosed businessman and a patron of the arts
the reflection of a window can be seen in the rim of bertin 's chair
it is barely discernible but adds spatial depth
the portrait of pope leo x c
<year> by raphael a source for the bertin portrait also features a window reflection of the pommel on the pope 's chair
the painting is signed j
ingres pinxit <year> in capitals at the top left and l
f
bertin also in capitals at the upper right
the frame is the original and thought to have been designed by ingres himself
it shows animals around a sinuous and richly carved grapevine
art historians paul mitchell and lynn roberts note that the design follows an old french tradition of placing austere male portraits within exuberantly carved frames
the frame closely resembles that of raphael 's c
<year> – <num> portrait of baldassare castiglione a painting that influenced ingres especially in colour and tone
it met with near universal praise to become his most successful artwork to that point
it sealed his reputation as a portraitist reaching far enough into public consciousness to become a standard for newspaper political satires
today it is considered his greatest portrait
ingres viewed all this as a mixed blessing remarking that since my portraits of bertin and molé everybody wants portraits
there are six that i 've turned down or am avoiding because i can 't stand them
before the official exhibition ingres displayed the painting in his studio for friends and pupils
most were lavish in their praise although louis lacuria confided to a friend that he feared people might find the colouring a bit dreary
he proved correct at the salon critics praised the draftsmanship but some felt the portrait exemplified ingres weakness as a colourist
it was routinely faulted for its purplish tone — which the ageing of the oil medium has transformed over time to warm greys and browns
bertin 's wife louis @-@ marie reportedly did not like the painting his daughter louise thought it transformed her father from a great lord to a fat farmer
given the standings of the two men the painting was received in both social and political terms
a number of writers mentioned bertin 's eventful career in tones that were according to art historian andrew carrington shelton either bitingly sarcastic or fawningly reverential
there were many satirical reproductions and pointed editorials in the following years
aware of bertin 's support of the july monarchy writers at the la gazette de france viewed the portrait as the epitome of the opportunism and cynicism of the new regime
their anonymous critic excitedly wondered what bitter irony it expresses what hardened skepticism sarcasm and
pronounced cynicism
several critics mentioned bertin 's hands
twentieth @-@ century art historian albert boime described them as powerful vulturine
grasping his thighs in a gesture
projecting
enormous strength controlled
some contemporary critics were not so kind
the photographer and critic félix tournachon was harshly critical and disparaged what he saw as a fantastical bundle of flesh
under which instead of bones and muscles there can only be intestines – this flatulent hand the rumbling of which i can hear bertin 's hands made a different impression on the critic f
de lagenevais who remarked a mediocre artist would have modified them he would have replaced those swollen joints with the cylindrical fingers of the first handy model but by this single alteration he would have changed the expression of the whole personality
the energetic and mighty nature
the work 's realism attracted a large amount of commentary when it was first exhibited
some saw it as an affront to romanticism others said that its small details not only showed an acute likeness but built a psychological profile of the sitter
art historian geraldine pelles sees bertin as at once intense suspicious and aggressive
she notes that there is a certain amount of projection of the artist 's personality and recalls théophile silvestre 's description of ingres there he was squarely seated in an armchair motionless as an egyptian god carved of granite his hands stretched wide over parallel knees his torso stiff his head haughty
some compared it to balthasar denner a german realist painter influenced by jan van eyck
denner in the words of ingres scholar robert rosenblum specialised in recording every last line on the faces of aged men and women and even reflections of windows in their eyes
the comparison was made by ingres admirers and detractors alike
in <year> louis de maynard of the collège @-@ lycée ampère writing in the influential l 'europe littéraire dismissed denner as a weak painter concerned with hyperrealistic curiosities and said that both he and ingres fell short of the sublime productions of ingres self @-@ proclaimed hero raphael
the following year ingres sought to capitalise on the success of his bertin portrait
he showed his ambitious history painting the martyrdom of saint symphorian at the <year> salon but it was harshly criticised even ingres admirers offered only faint praise
offended and frustrated ingres declared he would disown the salon abandon his residence in paris for rome and relinquish all current positions ending his role in public life
this petulance was not to last
bertin bequeathed the portrait to his daughter louise <year> – <num> on his death
she passed it to her niece marie @-@ louise @-@ sophie bertin <year> – <num> wife of jules bapst a later director of the journal des débats
they bequeathed it to their niece cécile bapst its last private owner
in <year> cécile sold it to the musée du louvre for <num> @,@ <num> francs
at first it served as a model for depictions of energetic and intellectual <num> @-@ century men and later as a more universal type
several <num> works closely echo its form and motifs
jean @-@ joseph benjamin @-@ constant 's monochrome and severe <year> portrait of alfred chauchard is heavily indebted while léon bonnat 's stern <year> portrait of the aging ernest renan has been described as a direct citation of ingres portrait
its influence can be seen in the dismissive stare and overwhelming physical presence of the sitter in pablo picasso 's <year> portrait of gertrude stein
picasso admired ingres and referred to him throughout his career
his invoking of bertin can be read as a humorous reference to according to robert rosenblum stein 's ponderous bulk and sexual preference
stein does not possess bertin 's ironic stare but is similarly dressed in black and leans forward in an imposing manner the painting emphasising her massive monumental presence
in <year> the swiss artist félix vallotton depicted stein in response to picasso making an even more direct reference to ingres portrait prompting édouard vuillard to exclaim that 's madame bertin the influence continued through the <num> century
gerald kelly recalled bertin when painting his restless and confined series of portraits of ralph vaughan williams in <year> – <num>
in <year> marcel broodthaers produced a series of nine black and white photographs on board based on ingres portraits of bertin and mademoiselle caroline rivière

stefani initially did not intend to tour to support the album responding what tour to a question from mtv news in december <year> regarding a possible tour
she later mentioned several times that she had not originally intended to tour in support of the album referring to her illegal tour and apologizing for her breaking her promise not to tour on stage at the xcel energy center in saint paul minnesota on november <num> and admitting i just wanted to make a record
i didn 't want to tour i was too tired then you guys kept buying the record and i had to come out and see you guys on stage at winnipeg on november <num>

and surrounded by her backing dancers also called the harajuku girls while video images of harajuku itself played on screens behind her
her second song was the first single from the album what you waiting for which she began as a ballad before bringing it up to its usual pace
stefani and the harajuku girls then left the stage to change into one @-@ piece bathing suits while her band continued to play before returning to perform the real thing
a group of four breakdancers came on stage to perform while stefani left the stage again to change into a black @-@ and @-@ white leather tracksuit
for the next song the album 's sixth single crash the audience were then divided into male and female halves and as images of a car hood bouncing to the beat were broadcast each half took turns to sing the lyric back it up back it up
stefani then performed the fourth single from the album luxurious
stefani changed outfits again into a pair of black hot pants to perform rich girl the album 's second single while walking along a catwalk into the crowd and giving fans high @-@ fives
she then sang danger zone and long way to go both intimate songs before performing two new songs back @-@ to @-@ back wind it up which would become the first single from her second album the sweet escape and orange county girl
wind it up was performed with a carnival vibe and orange county girl was accompanied by a video montage of childhood photos of stefani and images of items mentioned in the song
she changed into a silver sequinned cocktail dress for the fourth single from her first album cool
in early performances of the show stefani 's next song was hollaback girl the album 's third and best @-@ selling single performed in a drumming costume and singing with the audience
this was followed by an encore of serious and bubble pop electric for which stefani was brought out in a stretcher by the harajuku girls
however in later performances hollaback girl was saved for the encore and preceded by the two other songs
patrick macdonald of the seattle times while applauding stefani 's song @-@ writing efforts and the show 's frothy fun antics reprimanded the singer 's dancing and limited material given that she performed only twelve songs from love
angel
music
baby
and two from the sweet escape but none from previous work with her band no doubt
in regards to the musical selection macdonald concluded that half the songs are eminently forgettable a view echoed by winnipeg sun columnist rob williams who described some of the album tracks as filler
despite these objections williams issued her mts center performance a three @-@ and @-@ a @-@ half out of five stars
but sometimes the music didn 't matter when there was as much eye candy as stefani provided opined the winnipeg sun writer
she is an extremely striking figure and the choreography light show backup dancers and frequent costume changes all added to the spectacle which ended up being more style than substance
mike ross of the edmonton sun was impressed with stefani 's ability to engage the audience a quality that earned her the description of the effervescent hostess from the journalist
in his four star review for the concert he commended the swell music and amazing choreography it also had merit as a choreographic tour @-@ de @-@ force — thanks in large part to a quartet each of talented dancing geisha girls and b @-@ boys remarked ross
stefani 's different outfits and set pieces also won praise
so you could have enjoyed last night 's concert as a fashion show
or a music video sure ross concluded
although she called stefani the new princess of pop and praised the singer 's charismatic presence during the show jane stevenson of the toronto sun felt that the concert was definitely of the lightweight variety in the music department and noted that although stefani models herself after madonna she is no real threat
she gave the concert three @-@ and @-@ a @-@ half stars out of five
mtv 's corey moss compared stefani 's performance to madonna with regard to the eight costume changes to the dancers to the theatrics to hell even the music itself and avouched that she sounded completely different from how she did with no doubt
moss asserted that the no doubt lead vocalist was the most captivating thing onstage with her confident strut and dead @-@ on vocals
jon pareles of the new york times admired the glamour and groove antics of the show and how stefani flaunt ed the perks of stardom
he praised her music describing the album as a smart record with honed rhythm tracks that flit from funk to pop electronics to rock although calling most tracks superficial being about style success shopping and sex
jim harrison of soundspike affirmed that the harajuku lovers tour lacked a strong musical setlist and also felt that stefani 's stage presence was absent
he stated that she doesn 't have many songs that translate well in a live setting from her album love
angel
music
baby
and suggested that she should have included songs by no doubt for much @-@ needed shots of adrenaline for the audience who were according to harrison figuratively sitting on their hands and literally yawning four songs into the set
harrison felt that stefani seemed truly lost on stage without a band ultimately describing her performance as lacking in energy lukewarm and seemingly on autopilot
furthermore the soundspike writer thought that her performance was akin to that of fellow american recording artist britney spears which was utterly unsuitable for both the song selection and her style
however he did praise the rendition of hollaback girl calling it great and gwen being all gwen can be and called the breakdancing pretty cool
it was released on december <num> <year> the same release date as stefani 's second album the sweet escape
the dvd was directed by sophie muller
the concert features performances of all twelve songs from love

and two new songs from her second studio album the sweet escape as well as interviews with the musicians and dancers and a documentary of tour preparation

the dvd was certified gold in australia by the australian recording industry association and platinum in canada by the canadian recording industry association

it is a recording of the <year> work of the same name by italian composer luciano berio which featured lyrics taken from fellow italian edoardo sanguineti 's <year> poem laborintus
the performance was recorded live at the <year> holland festival
berio 's composition employs elements of jazz and electronic music and sanguineti 's libretto borrows ideas from the works of dante alighieri t
s
eliot and ezra pound as well as using his own original work
berio named memory death and usury as the work 's main concerns believing these themes to be present in dante 's work
released on july <num> <year> the album debuted at number <num> on the american billboard classic albums chart
it has received mixed reviews from critics most of whom highlighted its challenging and free @-@ form composition
the libretto was provided by edoardo sanguineti who included elements of his <year> poem laborintus in it
allmusic 's thom jurek described the original poem as speaking of the timelessness of love and mourning while acting as a critique of the commoditization of all things
in addition to sanguineti 's own poetry — itself based on themes found in dante 's divina commedia convivio and la vita nuova — the work uses excerpts from the bible and the writings of poets t
s
eliot and ezra pound
musically laborintus ii incorporates elements of jazz and electronic music while sometimes evoking the style of italian composer claudio monteverdi
berio described the main structure of laborintus ii as a catalogue in its medieval meaning exemplified by the etymologies of isodore of seville using dante 's themes of memory death and usury
members of the dutch choir nederlands kamerkoor which performed in the recording have also cited usury as a key theme in the work describing the composition as an indictment against the practice
of the form berio wrote individual words and sentences are sometimes to be regarded as autonomous entities and sometimes to be perceived as part of the sound structure as a whole
the instrumentation of laborintus ii was written as an extension of the vocal material its electronic section is likewise an extension of the instrumental music
berio used car tyres and a blow @-@ up doll on stage in a performance of the work at the holland festival in <year>
the album was recorded live at the holland festival on june <num> <year> in the muziekgebouw aan t ij
the work was performed by mike patton and the belgian ictus ensemble conducted by georges @-@ elie octors
solos were performed by ictus ensemble clarinetist dirk descheemaeker trumpeter loïc dumoulin trombonist michel massot double bass player géry cambier and percussionists michael weilacher and gerrit nulens
nederlands kamerkoor provided the choral accompaniments
the album marks only the third recording of the composition to have been released since it was first broadcast on french radio by office de radiodiffusion télévision française
patton has said of the work i can listen to berio and nono as easily as i can to morricone but like all modern music of italy it is unfortunately marginalized
maybe because of the language barrier maybe because it ’ s not easily understood
berio who was teaching in california when he wrote this piece was listening to jazz pop and folk music and incorporated all of it in his works without prejudice
patton 's spoken narration is delivered in italian although taped samples feature sanguineti speaking in english
from a whisper to a shout the words carry a variety of emotional tones as the work progresses
the choral parts respond to the narration both with unified chanting and with disjointed arguing the latter serving to increase the tension
they are accompanied by three female vocalists whose voices range from soprano singing to cooing and howling
the music incorporates elements of jazz and <num> @-@ century avant @-@ garde
the instruments in the orchestra frequently interrupt both each other and the female voices and some sections of the composition seem as though they are improvised
laborintus ii makes use of both traditional percussion instruments and electronic sounds and their interplay serves to erect musical and textural architectures then disassemble them quickly
max feldman has compared the style to that of raymond scott
the first part of the composition features the three female voices creating a mournful tone while the orchestra plays recurring musical passages
the second part is a discordant crescendo as patton 's narration becomes increasingly shouted and the orchestral accompaniment more hyperactive
the third and final part returns to a calmer tone focussing on drums and jazz woodwind instruments
in the united states the album debuted on the billboard classic albums chart at number <num> it spent one week on the chart

he felt that laborintus ii was perhaps patton 's most ambitious album to date but noted that the musician has previously produced similarly avant @-@ garde records in the past

max feldman of popmatters awarded laborintus ii a rating of seven out of ten finding berio 's composition challenging and exhausting

feldman felt that the music constantly emphasises its own unpredictability
consequence of sound 's carson o 'shoney rated the album three stars out of five calling it unlike anything else you ’ ve ever heard
o 'shoney felt that the music might need more than one hearing to appreciate it adding that it runs the gauntlet from quiet jazzy atmospherics to brazen unsettling primal noise

the establishment of the ambassador 's residence at the waldorf @-@ astoria made it the first hotel in history to house an ambassadorial residence
in <year> a townhouse at sutton place originally constructed by j
p
morgan in <year> was donated to the u
s
government by then owner arthur houghton with the intention it be used as a new ambassadorial residence
however ambassador adlai stevenson ii determined the home was not to his liking and the residence continued at the waldorf @-@ astoria
the sutton place townhouse was subsequently re @-@ gifted by the united states to the united nations and currently serves as the official residence of the secretary @-@ general of the united nations
in <year> ebony reported that andrew young and his family explored the possibility of moving out of the suite at the waldorf @-@ astoria and into a house instead
young who was the first ambassador to live in the suite with young children stated that t he waldorf is very nice and its convenient but i just have problems trying to bring up a small child in a hotel
however the search ultimately became a media issue and young elected to stay in the suite
nevertheless he opined that p eople tried to make it seem like i was saying that the waldorf wasn 't good enough for us
as of <year> the state department was paying <num> @,@ <num> per year to lease the suite on a rolling basis the lease is renewed every ten years with an optional one or two year short @-@ term extension
in <year> it was announced the state department would no longer permit staff to be housed at the waldorf @-@ astoria due to security concerns arising from the recent purchase of the property by chinese business interests
whether the decision would impact the status of the residence was not made clear however as of march <year> the hotel was still being occupied by the u

ambassador
w
bush john bolton adlai stevenson ii samantha power and bill richardson are among notable former residents of the suite
during his tenure as ambassador richard holbrooke elected not to occupy the <num> floor apartment choosing instead to live in his private manhattan home
in his place the residence was temporarily occupied by holbrooke 's assistant then <num> @-@ year old randolph eddy
according to reports holbrooke and his wife journalist kati marton would throw glittery parties in the suite where pols and foreign ministers mixed with the likes of robert de niro and sarah jessica parker

state of kansas
located entirely within washington county the route runs from u

route <num> us @-@ <num> north to the city limit of haddam
a previous designation of the route existed in the <num> from wichita to topeka but was deprecated
the current alignment was designated in the <num>
the route continues south as deer road toward vining
from this intersection k @-@ <num> heads north along deer road through a grassland area to an intersection with <num> road
the route then crosses the mulberry creek and runs near it until it reaches haddam
the roadway then crosses mill creek before meeting its northern terminus at the south city limit of haddam near an intersection with main street
deer road continues north toward the nebraska state line but does not cross it
the route is maintained by the kansas department of transportation kdot who is responsible for constructing and maintaining highways in the state
as part of this role kdot regularly surveys traffic on their highways
these surveys are most often presented in the form of annual average daily traffic which is the number of vehicles that use a highway during an average day of the year
in <year> kdot calculated that a total of <num> vehicles used the road daily including <num> trucks
no part of the highway has been listed as part of the national highway system a network of roads important to the nation 's defence mobility and economy
during this time most of the route was a dirt road except for a portion near garden city which was paved
this routing was relinquished by <year>
by <year> a new routing was created and the road instead began in wichita headed east along us @-@ <num> to eureka and north to emporia
from emporia the route turned northeast toward scranton and north into topeka
this designation was decommissioned between january and july <year>
the current designation of k @-@ <num> was established in <year>
no alignment changes have taken place since then
jose was the tenth named storm of the <year> atlantic hurricane season and the fourth of six tropical cyclones three hurricanes and three tropical storms to make landfall in mexico in that year
tropical storm jose formed in the bay of campeche on august <num> and made landfall in the mexican state of veracruz the next day
it retained tropical characteristics for less than one day before dissipating but still brought heavy levels of rainfall to the region
mudslides caused by the rainfall killed eight people six of those directly and caused <num> million <year> usd in damage
on august <num> the system spawned tropical depression ten over the central atlantic the wave itself continued westward entering the caribbean on august <num>
slight development took place as the system moved over the yucatán peninsula however by the time it entered the bay of campeche on august <num> little convection was associated with the system
the following morning convection exploded under highly favorable divergence from an upper @-@ level anticyclonic flow
according to readings from the quikscat satellite a well @-@ defined low pressure center developed by <num> utc prompting the national hurricane center to classify the system as tropical depression eleven
at this time the depression was situated roughly <num> mi <num> km east of veracruz mexico
situated over very warm waters and within an area of low wind shear the depression was able to quickly organize however due to its proximity to land the nhc noted the system does not have very long
to take advantage of these favorable conditions
located to the south of a mid @-@ level ridge the depression tracked just north of due west and kept this motion through the remainder of its existence
the depression rapidly intensified as it moved to the west becoming tropical storm jose just six hours later
the global model guidance initially failed to resolve the storm 's track well with some models indicating that it would stall offshore
jose continued to strengthen as it moved towards the coast and made landfall in the state of veracruz early on august <num> with winds reaching a peak of <num> mph <num> km h
as jose made its landfall an eye was beginning to form although the storm was still well short of hurricane intensity
tropical storm jose quickly weakened after landfall and dissipated that afternoon in the mountains of central mexico only <num> hours after forming
the area covered by the warning issued on august <num> was extended southwards as jose intensified before being canceled soon after landfall on august <num>
the advisories issued by the national hurricane center emphasized that rainfall from jose was the primary threat
tropical storm jose was responsible for damaging crops highways and homes flooding districts in several cities in the state of veracruz and the evacuation of <num> @,@ <num> people to shelters
the government of that state estimated the damages caused by the storm to be approximately <num> million <year> usd
approximately <num> municipalities were affected by the torrential rain but the majority of the damage was concentrated to eight of them martínez de la torre misantla nautla san rafael vega de la torre actopan cardel and úrsulo galván
damage to the highway infrastructure was estimated at <num> million <year> usd
it was also reported that the storm damaged at least <num> @,@ <num> homes and about <num> square kilometers <num> thousand acres of land used for cattle
in addition over <num> square kilometers <num> thousand acres of various crops including sugarcane corn and bananas were flooded
many boats were also lost as a result of jose
<num> active medical brigades were sent to the region to reduce the risk of infections amongst the affected population
jose was responsible for six direct casualties
one of these deaths was the result of a mud slide that killed a man was in xalapa veracruz
the other five deaths were also due to mudslides in oaxaca
the company was established in december <year> and started a catering service in <year>
originally owned by the norwegian trunk railway it was acquired by the state in <year>
meals served in the restaurant carriages were relatively expensive although they were available to all passengers
in the <num> the company began using serving trolleys on trains
in january <year> nss merged with the convenience @-@ store chain narvesen kioskkompani into a new company called narvesen – spisevognselskapet
this enterprise was partly owned by the norwegian state railways nsb and fritt ord before it merged with the reitan group and was delisted from the oslo stock exchange
train stations also lacked dining facilities
the first dining service was started by restaurateur carl christiansen
he established the restaurant at drammen station and in <year> was asked by nsb to establish a dining service aboard the express trains on the bergen line which would open in <year>
after investigating similar operations in england and germany he ordered two carriages from skabo jernbanevognfabrikk
these were to be paid for by the state but the parliament of norway delayed the grants after a long debate regarding the suitability of restaurant carriages on trains
the plans were opposed by the teetotaler faction of parliament but there was a majority in favor of dining service
to get the carriages in time christiansen personally guaranteed the production cost in case a state grant was not allocated
after the parliamentary decision the cost of the carriages was refunded by nsb
in <year> when president of the united states theodore roosevelt visited oslo to receive the nobel peace prize several restaurant carriages were ordered solely for the occasion
two years later restaurant carriages were put in regular service on the østfold line
the board stated that they wanted to minimise the conflict of interest between the railway company and the dining @-@ car operator
they also saw centralising operations as a way to allocate a larger share of the revenue to the railway company and to ensure a high quality of service on new lines
at that time the sørland line and dovre line were in the planning stages and the nsb intended to introduce dining services on these when they opened
oslo east station and its restaurant were operated by the private norwegian trunk railway
in an agreement signed on <num> september <year> both railway companies agreed that a new restaurant operator would be controlled by the norwegian trunk railway but this company had to abide by the nsb 's decision of how many restaurant carriages to operate on any line
this model was inspired by sweden where a separate dining company had been established this company paid the railway company part of its revenue and a fixed fee per restaurant carriage
the swedish model involved including the operation of station restaurants at locations where the restaurant carriages would have depots
on <num> december <year> a
s norsk spisevognselskap was established with a share capital of <num> @,@ <num> norwegian krone nok
it had <num> shares <num> were owned by the trunk railway and one by each of three directors waldemar stoud platou gotfred furuholmen and christian emil stoud platou — the former representing the trunk railway and the latter being director @-@ general of the nsb
in january <year> waldemar platou was appointed chair and christiansen managing director
the company took over christiansen 's four restaurant carriages and the restaurant at oslo ø on <num> april <year>
on <num> february <year> parliament voted to nationalise the trunk railway
during the debate the organisation of spisevognselskapet was criticised with the nationalisation the state became the sole owner of spisevognselskapet
on <num> march <year> the ministry of labour recommended that the company remain a state @-@ owned limited company the minority in parliament wanted a state enterprise
during the <num> sigurd astrup was managing director of norsk spisevognselskap
in <year> erling mossige was appointed managing director of the company
he was succeeded by knut tvedt in <year>
the company had <num> employees in <year> and <num> in <year>
usually three or four dishes were offered in the restaurant carriages
a four @-@ course dinner cost five norwegian kroner in the <num> which was expensive at the time
warm dishes such as soups and sauces were usually prepared at a small stove in the restaurant carriage 's kitchen
on busy days prepared steaks were delivered from rail depots
the kitchens were staffed by two maids and one attendant
blocks of ice were often used instead of refrigerators
with the opening of the dovre line spisevognselskapet established dining @-@ car service on <num> june <year>
in <year> a train ride from kristiania to trondheim lasted approximately <num> hours and the average waiting time at each station was between <num> and <num> minutes
on <num> july <year> dining service was introduced on the valdres line from <num> july <year> on the brevik line from may <year> on the nordland line and from <num> may <year> on the røros line
in <year> <num> @,@ <num> meals were served on board in addition to sandwiches and drinks
the company also offered a light breakfast on night trains on the kongsvinger østfold and dovre lines
during the second world war dining @-@ car service was discontinued
after the war trains faced competition from aviation and automobiles and serving trolleys were installed on norwegian trains
in <year> cart service on trains was centralised and standardised food service was faster and prices were lowered
during the <num> cafeteria cars were used where passengers could serve themselves
initially the company operated the restaurant at oslo ø from <year> it also took over operation of the restaurants at oslo west station hamar koppang opdal and elverum
the following year four more restaurants were added støren myrdal dokka and hell
nss also established its first kiosk at bergen station
in <year> the company was allowed to take over all restaurants in the railway districts of oslo and hamar by <year> it had taken over operation of the restaurants at lillehammer hønefoss jessheim kornsjø halden ski eidsvoll otta dombås åndalsnes kongsvinger trondheim rena roa ringebu bjorli and finse
after this nss decided not to obtain many additional restaurants as it did not see value in such a strategy
from <year> through <year> the company took over restaurants at ål jaren lillestrøm and tønsberg along with dining service on the steamship skibladner which ran on mjøsa
during the first half of the <num> it again acquired new restaurants including the one at kristiansand station
in <year> and <year> the company made a solid profit but lack of food from <year> onwards transformed the profit to a loss
during the late <num> nss also took over the restaurants at drammen and sarpsborg as well as the one at oslo airport fornebu
operation of the <num> @-@ room hotel was taken over by spisevognselskapet on <num> october <year>
nsb was at the time building the dovre line between oslo and trondheim and was considering establishing hotels where the line passed through dovrefjell
both hjerkinn and fokkstua were considered but these areas were served by other operators
instead spisevognselskapet established the oppdal tourist hotel adjacent to oppdal station and it opened on <num> june <year>
the <num> @-@ bed hotel had a floor area of <num> square metres <num> @,@ <num> sq ft and was marketed as a tourist destination with bobsleigh and curling during the winter and tennis and croquet in summer
the hotel was closed for part of <year> because the municipality would not allow it to serve alcoholic beverages
in oslo the company had its offices and workings spread around town
the main depot was at the east station the head office was at fred
olsens gate <num> from <year> to <year> at kongens gate <num> until <year> and at tollbodgaten <num> until <year>
management wanted to centralise both a new depot and administrative offices at a single location close to the railway station preferably co @-@ located with a hotel
in <year> work began on a hotel at jernbanetorget but the project was cancelled
the proposed hotel would have had <num> rooms across the street from oslo ø
however the plans were blocked by parliament which was opposed to the state railway operating hotels
instead the administration moved into nylandsveien <num> in a new building built on a lot owned by nsb
in bergen the company established hotel terminus bergen along with other investors but the hotel failed to make money
in the late <num> the company bought grand hotell bellevue in ålesund and later operated saltfjellet tourist hotel for a short period
in <year> oslo municipality 's viking hotel was completed and spisevognselskapet was selected as the operator
it remained the hotel 's operator until <year> when the government sold it to eiendomsinvest which outbid spisevognselskapet by several million krone
narvesen had a near @-@ monopoly on newsagents in norway and rented facilities in many public places
the owners of narvesen intended to create a foundation to obtain the company when plans for this started in <year> they had difficulties finding a way to transfer shares to the foundation without having to pay tax on the transaction
however the tax laws permitted a tax @-@ free transaction if it was part of a restructuring
a merger with spisevognselskapet would be considered a restructuring and in <year> fritt ord was established to take over narvesen 's owners share of the company
the agreement between narvesen and nsb was made in july <year> in december it was passed by parliament although the conservative party and progress party voted against the merger
a
s narvesen – spisevognselskapet was established on <num> january <year>
fritt ord owned <num> of the new company and nsb <num>
it assumed the narvesen name in <year>
by the late <num> the company had sold all its hotel operations
the merged company retained the obligation to operate dining services on the trains which throughout the <num> necessitated considerable subsidies from nsb
in <year> nsb decided to organize the operation of the dining services through tendered contracts the first contract from <year> through <year> was won by togservice a narvesen subsidiary
the owners had an agreement that neither could sell without the approval of the other
in <year> nsb sold its shares with fritt ord 's approval and the company was listed on the oslo stock exchange
in <year> fritt ord reduced its stock share in narvesen from <num> to <num>
in the fall of <year> fritt ord accepted a proposal to merge narvesen with the reitan group
the merged company was named reitannarvesen fritt ord held <num>

the film features orilla smith yale boss frank hall crane and nicholas jordan
the production was not the first film subject by the company but it was the first to be released
both barry o 'neil and lloyd b
carleton have been credited as the director of the production
edwin thanhouser stated that <num> copies of the film were produced and distributed to dealers
the film begins with two unemployed parents obtaining employment in an upcoming theater production
shortly after returning home the landlady shows up and demands the rent but can not collect
she gives them one week but the theater production does not manifest and the parents again search for work
while they are out the landlady finds a tenant and puts the children out on the street
they end up dancing for an organ grinder and are saved by a theater manager who puts them on his vaudeville bill
the parents come into a fortune and are reunited by their children at the theater
the film was met with positive reviews and some criticism for its acting and scenario but the industry had reasons to encourage the success of edwin thanhouser 's company
a print of the film exists but it was the subject of nitrate deterioration
eugenie freeman and paul temple marry and have two children a boy and a girl
the parents have been unemployed but the film starts with the parents finding work in an upcoming production at a theater
as they return home they are interrupted by the landlady mrs
o 'brien who demands the rent
the landlady does not car about the family 's misfortune and is upset when she cannot collect
she provides one week for the temple family to pay up
the production is postponed and the parents are out looking for work when a prospective tenant appears
mrs
o 'brien shows him the room and he is interested but does not know what to do with the children
mrs
o 'brien puts the children out onto the street where they dance to the music played by an organ grinder
the organ grinder earns more money from their dancing and he entices the children to return to his hovel and teaches them to dance
the organ grinder instructs them to dance for money
the children are rescued by a theater manager and finds them a place in the theater program
in the meantime the parents have searched for their children and suddenly come into a fortune when a relative bequeaths a large sum of money to them
the parents search for their children in large gatherings and find their children dancing on the vaudeville bill from their theater box
the family is reunited and the film concludes
lonergan who employed the deus ex machina dramatic technique in the conclusion of the plot
in film this is the sudden inheritance and parents finding their children in the theater
the two children orilla smith and yale boss were child actors with prior film experience and did not have any further known connection to the thanhouser company after the production
the cameraman blair smith used a camera rented by the columbia phonograph company and had its inventor joseph bianchi assist in the camera 's operation and use
the director of has both been credited to barry o 'neil and lloyd b
carleton in numerous trade sources
smith was the first cameraman of the thanhouser company but this film was not the thanhouser company 's first subject
instead it was the mad hermit produced in autumn <year> and shelved until august <num> <year>
the exact order of the productions is not known but a work titled aunt nancy telegraphs was filmed in december <year> and never released
certain parts of the actor 's children were produced in the last week of february <year>
the director of the film is not known but two possibles exist
barry o 'neil was the stage name of thomas j
mccarthy who would direct many important thanhouser pictures including its first two @-@ reeler romeo and juliet
lloyd b
carleton was the stage name of carleton b
little a director who would stay with the thanhouser company until moving to the biograph company by the summer of <year>
the confusion between the directing credits stems from the industry practice of not crediting the film directors even in studio news releases
q
david bowers says that the attribution of these early directors often comes from a collection of contemporary publications or interviews
in later years edwin thanhouser recalled that <num> copies of the film were produced and sent out to dealers throughout the united states
of these <num> copies produced ten were returned some with letters of interest in future thanhouser productions
the moving picture world reviews would be favorable and without much criticism even calling the acting convincing
a more honest review in the new york dramatic mirror was written by a reviewer who was pleased with the production but offered criticism about the production 's weaker aspects
the reviewer found there to be too much emphasis on the unimportant parts and a lack of emotion from the actors and the child actors performance was faulted by repeatedly looking at the camera
critical reception of the film may not have been entirely neutral for a number of reasons
edwin thanhouser was a well @-@ liked gentleman who had many friends in the patents company that likely wanted him to succeed
furthermore writers in the magazines hoped that independents would succeed and challenge the patents company 's stranglehold on the industry
also film critics and reviewers of the era would balance the negativity of even the worst films with some favorable aspects
even without any ulterior motives the film may have been worthy of a favorable review
the release managed to survive against considerable odds but the surviving print is not without severe faults
the surviving print has considerable nitrate deterioration and very poor picture quality in certain parts
this film survives in the academy of motion picture arts and sciences film archives
written by series creator bruno heller and directed by michael apted the episode first aired in the united states on home box office hbo on august <num> <year> and on the bbc in the united kingdom and ireland on november <num>
rome was given a budget of <num> million making it the largest amount both networks had ever spent on a series
heller centered the series narrative on the perspectives of two common soldiers similar to rosencrantz and guildenstern from shakespeare 's hamlet
apted shot the episode at cinecittà the roman studio where the epic films ben @-@ hur and cleopatra were filmed
on the set realism and authenticity were emphasized more than grandiosity with depictions of a cosmopolitan city of all social classes
as the wars in gaul come to an end julius caesar ciarán hinds is faced with both triumph and tribulation
on the heels of his victory comes news of his daughter 's death
awarded with the adulation of the people he also garners the enmity of politicians in rome including pompey the great kenneth cranham
in rome pompey must balance honor and politics as he is urged to betray his former friend
meanwhile caesar 's niece atia of the julii polly walker tries to steer her family on the dangerous path between the growing divisions of power
in the gallic countryside two unlikely allies kevin mckidd and ray stevenson journey to reclaim the stolen standard of the roman legion
hbo described its marketing strategy as its largest most aggressive for a new series and media outlets estimated its cost at <num> million
on its first broadcast an estimated <num>
<num> million us viewers watched the episode
on its first airing in the uk and ireland it secured an estimated audience of <num>
<num> million people
critical reception was largely mixed with several reviewers writing that the episode suffered from slow storytelling
the stolen eagle garnered four major awards including the primetime emmy award for outstanding special visual effects and the directors guild of america award for outstanding directing – drama series
in contrast to the gauls chaotic charge the roman files fight with precision until one drunk legionary titus pullo breaks ranks and charges into the crowd of gauls
vorenus angrily orders him back into formation but pullo hits him
later the assembled soldiers watch as pullo is flogged and condemned to death for his disorderly conduct
the day after vercingetorix king of the gauls is brought before julius caesar and made to surrender ending the eight @-@ year @-@ long gallic wars
caesar 's niece atia of the julii orders her son octavian to deliver a horse she has purchased straight to caesar in gaul to ensure that he remembers them above all other well @-@ wishers
caesar himself receives news that his daughter married to his friend gnaeus pompeius magnus with whom he shares power in rome has died in childbirth along with her stillborn daughter
a blood tie broken between them caesar orders a new wife be found for pompey
in the roman senate cato the younger moves that caesar be stripped of his command and recalled to rome to answer charges of misusing his office and illegal warmongering
pompey as sole consul present vetoes the motion insisting in trusting caesar
at the theater that night scipio introduces his daughter cornelia metella to pompey as a prospective wife while cato warns him that he must ally against caesar before it is too late
pompey again asserts that caesar means no harm although privately he is troubled by caesar 's rising prestige and power and gives orders to one of his slaves who is leaving on a trip to gaul
at night in the encampment of the <num> legion the aquila eagle standard is stolen by brigands
to avoid a potentially disastrous drop in morale mark antony orders vorenus to retrieve it
as vorenus feels the mission is doomed to failure he has the condemned pullo released from the stockade to assist him
in camp caesar welcomes marcus junius brutus his unofficial stepson whose mother is caesar 's lover servilia of the junii
later at a party hosted by servilia brutus confides to pompey that the loss of the eagle has made caesar unusually vulnerable as his men are on the brink of mutiny
on the road to caesar 's camp in gaul octavian is taken captive by brigands
for caesar 's request atia instructs her daughter octavia to marry pompey by first divorcing her husband glabius despite octavia 's protests that they are deeply in love
atia then presents octavia to pompey at a party and offers her for premarital relations which pompey takes advantage of
vorenus and pullo set off in search of the eagle encountering and rescuing octavian from his captors
octavian thanks them and promises that they will be rewarded
vorenus and pullo discover pompey 's slave with the eagle hiding in the bandit cart and kill him realizing the bandits were hired by pompey
a politically astute octavian explains that their mission is only a gesture since the theft of the eagle is actually a blessing in disguise to caesar
civil war between caesar and pompey is inevitable but caesar needs pompey to make the first move so as not to appear the aggressor pompey is likely to do that if he believes caesar 's soldiers are on the verge of desertion
the trio returns in triumph to camp where a surprised yet grateful caesar takes the eagle back and more than adequate proof of pompey 's hostility
he sends pompey the head of his slave and informs him of his next move to winter the <num> legion at ravenna on the italian border in preparation for pressing his rights to the consulship
pompey breaks all ties with caesar and takes cornelia as his wife
octavia humiliated at being used by pompey and heartbroken over her pointless divorce says she wants him dead
heller said the era of the roman empire was pivotal in western history
if things hadn 't turned out the way they did at that particular point the world that we live in now would be very different
he decided to tell the story of the series from the perspectives of two common soldiers lucius vorenus and titus pullo
according to heller they are the only two ordinary soldiers mentioned by caesar in his book so the idea was to do a sort of rosencrantz and guildenstern take
i essentially took the seed of that idea to try to tell a big historical epic but from the street level the everyman 's point of view
the episode title is a reference to the standard of the roman legion a symbol that represents the legion 's unity
while the storyline detailing its theft was based on fiction heller believed that it showed how caesar could turn misfortune into opportunity
he was always one step ahead of his enemies
certain characters were changed from their traditional images for instance while brutus has been portrayed as the noblest roman heller and historical consultant jonathan stamp thought it would be interesting to have him forced into his later role through his ancestry
alluding to the fact that brutus great great great grandfather drove the last king out of rome stamp said that his family history was pushing him in one direction his emotions in another
scottish actress lindsay duncan who was cast as servilia believed that she and other uk actors can do old can do classic and you believe it
she also said that because of long distances american actors or those of other nationalities were avoided transporting actors from los angeles to rome on a regular basis does not look good for the budget
we 're quite cheap
stamp described servilia as the great love of julius caesar 's life his mistress and by all counts the only woman he truly loved
irish actor ciarán hinds was cast as caesar
hinds first thought it was silly to be offered the part but then you think it 's quite an honour to be chosen to play it
and then you think oh shit i 've got to do it and then well i suppose someone has to do it heller had believed that hinds would make a great caesar for a long time and considered the series extremely lucky for being able to cast him
scottish actor kevin mckidd who had never appeared in a television series that necessitated over twelve months of filming was cast as lucius vorenus one of the lead characters
mckidd said what was different about this show is you get <num> months to really get into every nook and cranny of the character in a way you don 't get a chance to explore when you do a movie or a theater play
initially it was a terrifying prospect
but once you got over that you realize what a great opportunity it was
heller described his character as very much a roman of the old school a stoic man devoted to duty and religion and the legion
ray stevenson played titus pullo a soldier who befriends vorenus
mckidd said that they 're kind of thrown together by fate by chance but somewhere along the line they start to stick
they keep finding themselves accidentally at the epicenter of tumultuous events and immense change so they 're kind of clinging to each other
caesar 's niece atia was portrayed by actress polly walker
according to heller while most auditioning actresses assumed that the character was the series villainess walker made atia bigger than life but completely real
she could read the phone book with that kind of brio and joy
rather than a villain heller wrote her to be a real life force
everything she 's doing is for the good of her family her children
no matter how evil it gets it 's always for good reason
walker was pleased with her very complex character
i found it exciting to play such massive emotions and deal with such interesting to say the least situations
i saw it as a huge challenge and i have huge admiration for this character
a lot of people might consider her to be sort of evil or bad but i think she 's wonderful
she 's just a survivor doing what she 's got to do
the season was filmed between march <year> and july <year> at locations in or around rome and on a set considered to be the biggest and most expensive ever built for television
it was built at cinecittà where the epic films ben @-@ hur <year> and cleopatra <year> had been filmed
production designer joseph bennett built a set that emphasized authenticity and realism rather than grandiosity
he said people think of rome as white and cold and beautiful powerful but distant
but based on the research i don 't think it was like that at all
if you go to pompeii you 're struck by how garish it is even now
the temples and sculptures were all brightly painted
rome was like pompeii but much bigger
and rome was so noisy it was impossible to sleep
it was like hell
think of it as a combination of new york and calcutta with insane wealth and insane poverty
it was pretty extreme
the series begins with opening credits that depict traditional roman myths such as romulus and remus the city 's foundation mythos
for inspiration visual effects and design company a52 explored museums read the script and researched roman history
they created the opening sequence entirely in @-@ house
vfx artist kirk balden said of production on many projects you start off with storyboards and everyone has a good idea of what it 's going to look like when it 's completed
this project was very experimental right to the very end
the tone of it is pretty much unlike anything we 've done and most of what any of us here have seen
there 's a lot there that creatively sets the stage for the series
heller was responsible for writing the episode 's voice @-@ over despite his dislike of the task
he said that despite it being his <num> version he was still not happy with it
he believed that an early scene in which cart distributes spoils in front of pompey represented the first real sense of how the series would depict city life
he said i think this is the first time that we get sense of the version of rome that the show is pushing which was a very different version than viewers may have been used to
to him rome was colorful and painted and cosmopolitan
a later scene featuring cicero the younger in the senate proved difficult to film because of the large number of italian extras who did not speak english
in the dvd audio commentary he said that this is one of those scenes where you need really great assistant directors because all of these italian extras who have no idea whatsoever what cicero 's saying so to keep them interested and focused and concentrated on what 's going on is a real trick
anachronistic stirrups were used to ensure the safety of the actors though the crew attempted to conceal or camouflage them for historical authenticity as they were not then used by the roman cavalry
extras playing soldiers attended a boot camp under the guidance of a former royal marine
those actors portraying legionnaires learned to fight by thrusting not slashing their weapons
artisans reportedly handmade four thousand costumes using authentic period materials such as cotton linen wool and silk all of which were hand @-@ dyed on set
pullo was originally written to be a poor horse rider a reflection that romans were notoriously bad horsemen according to heller
however stevenson turned out to be probably the best horseman on the show so they rewrote this characteristic because bad horsemanship is difficult to fake
james madigan the visual effects supervisor approached the series as a feature film observing that every aspect of the production took meticulous care with every detail the costumes the set dressing the acting and the attention to historical fact
as you worked on it you really got the feeling that rome was going to look like something we had never seen on tv before so our vfx approach very much wanted to respect that
madigan attempted to seamlessly mesh the visual effects with the physical sets and depend less on cgi
a friend told madigan that after seeing the pilot he didn ’ t see any vfx shots even though there are dozens of shots throughout episode <num>
that means we did our job well
the channel broadcast the first three episodes seven days a week at various times during the day
non @-@ subscribers could preview the first two episodes during the first week of september <year>
hbo implemented an outdoor marketing campaign in major cities and produced movie @-@ style trailers which preceded a number of films in cinemas
entertainment weekly vanity fair time and gq published full @-@ size articles about the series
the history channel broadcast five nights of documentaries featuring the roman empire which were hosted by stevenson mckidd and varma a collaboration which was the first of its kind between the two networks
david baldwin the executive vice president of program planning said this is a huge series for us
we wanted to give it every opportunity to be seen by as many people as possible
media outlets estimated that the entire marketing campaign cost hbo <num> million the most the network had spent on marketing a series to that point
commentators viewed the success of rome as crucial for the network especially after the past mixed reception of carnivàle and k @-@ street
in july <year> james hibberd of television week wrote that rome was viewed as the network 's best shot for adding another literate must @-@ see drama to its schedule
writing for the same publication tom shales said that hbo has made such a fuss over rome and the network itself has put such painful pressure on the show and its producers to make a hefty impact that it 'll be scorned like a leper if it fails to make a truly gigantic splash
an estimated <num>
<num> million viewers watched the episode less than the series premieres of carnivale and deadwood but consistent with the series finale of six feet under
in the uk and ireland the premiere was broadcast on bbc <num> on november <num> <year>
according to the independent more than <num>
<num> million viewers watched the episode
mark a
perigard of the boston herald wrote less perverse than i claudius more entertaining than american broadcasting company 's abc toga twister empire rome gets off to an uneven start
terry morrow of the dayton daily news criticized the premiere writing that the opener like most pilots is so bogged down with introducing faces and setting up the story that it turns into a long and tedious journey
morrow also said the episode suffered from lacking one standout signature character though he believed that the flaws in rome should clear up in time given hbo 's knack for winning dramas
it 's an epic story and one worth savoring if you can muddle through the demands of slow storytelling in the beginning
the scotsman 's robert mcneil thought that the premiere was shocking but also rather slow as characters are established
maybe it 'll get better
in the meantime to paraphrase roger mcgough i came i saw i concurred with those who say rome wasn 't built in an hour
similarly opinionated was the cincinnati post 's rick bird who said that like other hbo series rome takes a while to get going
after the first episode you will mostly be confused with a dizzying array of characters intrigue and subplots
hang in there
by the second episode things take shape and one should be hooked by episode three with this steamy romp through antiquity and its lusty intrigue
bird found some positive elements the episode he said was enhanced by marvelous filmmaking including elaborate sets and costumes
small @-@ screen film art has rarely painted such a realistic picture of ancient rome
paul english of the daily record wrote that rome is visually dazzling full of vim and tantalizingly seductive adding that mckidd 's growling turn as ceasar 's sic footsoldier lucius vorenus will undoubtedly propel him into the us major league
writing for the los angeles daily news david kronke failed to find the series very remarkable writing that notwithstanding some lurid sex and gruesome violence it is as conventional as anything the network has ever done
sword @-@ and @-@ sandals epics have become familiar hollywood staples
and those expecting something that takes up where the legendarily decadent bbc pbs series i claudius left off may be in for something of a disappointment
television without pity graded the episode with a b
some viewers criticized the graphic nudity seen in the pilot especially in the us
heller commented romans didn 't have our body shame and fear of sexuality
i think that is part of the modern fascination with that world
there was a lack of shame about those things that we had to portray with a lack of shame in order to make it work

the first is in a mental battle with sora depicted as a cut @-@ scene and the second is with naminé who has merged with her other self kairi
in the re @-@ released version of the title kingdom hearts ii final mix roxas fight against sora was expanded making him a boss character
the battle was meant to be interactive in kingdom hearts ii but time constraints imposed from creating fights for the other organization xiii members prevented inclusion
with the opportunity to include the fight nomura 's team worked hard to make it entertaining for players
additional scenes regarding roxas past were added to the game to add to the mystery around him

he makes a cameo appearance at the end of kingdom hearts birth by sleep where he is shown with xion and axel eating sea @-@ salt ice cream in twilight town as well as in kingdom hearts 3d dream drop distance where roxas contacts both axel and sora through dreams
he also appears in shiro amano 's manga and tomoko kanemaki 's novels which reprise his role in the video games
the book kingdom hearts another report includes a novel called roxas – somewhere in time that retells roxas days in the organization with the exception of his befriending xion
however he refrained from revealing too much detail about him and stated that he would become an important playable character for the franchise
the developers wrote roxas story in kingdom hearts ii to add mixed feelings to the game in a short time frame
after receiving a positive fan response regarding roxas sad scenario nomura concluded that it was well executed
he also stated that roxas merging with sora in the game was one of his most memorable scenes from the series
nomura later commented that roxas was one of the first characters created for organization xiii and was always intended to be the <num> member
the meaning of roxas name was meant to be revealed in a scene in kingdom hearts ii that shows the letters in the word sora rearranged with the x added to expand the connection between the characters
this scene however was omitted as nomura found it difficult to implement time @-@ wise
since his debut in kingdom hearts ii roxas has been voiced by kōki uchiyama in japanese and by jesse mccartney in the english versions
after kingdom hearts ii final mix was released nomura wanted to expand roxas role in the series to explain the events between his birth and his disappearance from organization xiii
for kingdom hearts <num> <num> days the staff thought that roxas role as a member of the group would be a suitable theme for the plot
roxas was chosen as the game 's protagonist as the staff thought that having a main character besides sora would help to introduce gamers to the series first nintendo ds title
co @-@ director tomohiro hasegawa explained that roxas height was originally lower and as the game continued development the staff decided to increase it
nomura desired to portray roxas activities different from sora 's
in sora 's games he is on a journey around the worlds while roxas always returns to organization xiii after each mission
the staff constructed roxas interactions with the disney characters to be different from sora 's as the organization was meant to be secret in the game 's story
nomura told the writers that he wanted roxas to learn something from each of his missions or just to have something to think about
nomura later clarified that roxas personality was different from the one portrayed in kingdom hearts ii as he does not actively attempt to come into contact with other characters
with kingdom hearts <num> <num> days nomura wanted to reveal why roxas left organization xiii
although nomura found it to be a sad story it he considered zack fair 's ending in crisis core final fantasy vii more tragic
his last words in the game were also nomura 's most significant ones from the title as he wanted it to connect to kingdom hearts ii 's first scene which is actually the same scene
uchiyama expressed sadness when the game ended development as he would not play the character for a long time
kingdom hearts ii final mix 's secret ending features a character named ventus that bears a striking resemblance to roxas
nomura commented that despite how similar they are roxas and ventus are not the same character
additionally he stated that by playing kingdom hearts birth by sleep players will be able to distinguish roxas from ventus
in another interview nomura implied both characters are related specifically to sora but he wanted fans to imagine reasons for such connection
the kingdom hearts birth by sleep ultimania clarified the connection stating that roxas and ventus look alike because ventus heart entered sora 's body and roxas birth allowed ventus heart to reside in roxas
this also confirms the mystery about roxas having a heart in contrast to other nobodies which allows him to express emotions despite his lack of memories from a past something that nobodies use to show emotions
an action figure was released as part of the play arts action figures series
other items sold include plush keychains and replicas of his necklace

while reviewing kingdom hearts ii jeff haynes of ign said that roxas was a likable kid
ron fahey of eurogamer took a similar stance calling him a likeable enough young chap who just happens to be troubled by memories and visions of people he doesn 't even know
his playable position in the game was regarded as a transitional arc being used to introduce the gameplay to players that are new to the franchise
cavin smith from psxextreme also called roxas a likable character and stated that the revelation regarding his existence in kingdom hearts ii is a shocker of a revelation for any rpg the new york times liked the fact that the player controls roxas in kingdom hearts ii 's introduction instead of the protagonist sora avoiding the continuation of sora 's search for his friends
additionally he found the switch from roxas story to sora 's after a few hours a little jarring
andrew reiner from game informer emphasizes his role as a troubled boy calling his story arc an amazing chain of events particularly noting that the revelation of his nature as a nobody creates a devilish yet remarkable plot twist which may impact the player in a way that he may not want sora back
on the other hand ugo networks commented that due to the game 's initial focus on roxas gamers would have to wait until playing as sora to experience the most exciting parts of the title
before kingdom hearts <num> <num> days was released 1up

a similar response was made by game informer who commented that although such scenes were dull roxas relation with xion and axel was appealing and the game 's ending would make up for such moments
gamesradar also commented that roxas starts off like a zombie but rapidly develops a personality during the title and joked about the numerous times he eats ice cream
his growth in the game was also labelled as one of the most enjoyable elements from the title
ign agreed calling roxas friendship heart @-@ aching
on the other hand 1up
com mentioned that although roxas relationship with xion and axel is appealing some of his first missions feel like lonely sad affairs
his maneuvers in the game were praised by gamespot for being easy to learn despite how complex they look while ign liked the variation between all of them

i wrote the song in malibu and we went back to malibu to film the video
i had never done a video exactly where i wrote the song
then we take my little blue truck from the movie and travel back across the country

the game is presented in a 3d isometric format
the pendragon series was created and designed by brothers dave and bob thomas with ultimate founders tim and chris stamper otherwise being uninvolved in development

critics were divided over the game 's graphics and re @-@ usage of sprites but criticised the game for its vast similarities to its predecessors
it was followed by a final instalment to the series dragon skulle which was released later in <year>
sir arthur pendragon 's main objective is to free the soul of its former captain richard cavendish
pendragon can utilise various weapons such as knives daggers and a magic sword to defend himself from enemy skeletons

if pendragon completely runs out of energy a large skeletal hand will drag the player off @-@ screen thus killing him
various segments of maps are scattered around the galleon which will form a complete view of the game 's overworld once all the segments are picked up
other scattered items in the game include keys for locked doors gunpowder to fire cannons and pieces of jewellery the latter having no additional use other than adding to the player 's score
under the trading name of ultimate play the game they began producing multiple video games for the zx spectrum throughout the early <num>
the company was known for their reluctance to reveal details about their operations and upcoming projects
little was known about their development process except that they used to work in separate teams one team would work on graphics while the other would concentrate on other aspects such as sound or programming
the pendragon series was created by brothers dave and robert bob thomas rather than ultimate founders tim and chris stamper
dave thomas began his career in <year> when he started producing multiple games for the atari <num> including moderate @-@ sellers such as warlok which later won him gb £ <num> @,@ <num> in a competition from calisto software
although he began working for the company in producing video games he later quit due to the strain of his daily <num> mi <num> km commute

the name of sir arthur pendragon was copied from the character of the black prince pendragon from jack the giant killer
the graphics of the game were designed by bob thomas whereas the code was written by dave thomas
the thomas brothers decided to show their progress of the game to tim and chris stamper for evaluation despite feeling embarrassed due to their workspace being inside their parents attic
impressed by the game the stamper brothers commissioned an entire series to be released for the commodore <num>
dave thomas recalled that every game they produced was met with little interference from ultimate once a game was complete it would be sent to quality assessment and subsequently published for release
a reviewer of cvg thought the graphics were identical to its predecessor entombed and criticised the low detail of the player @-@ character sir arthur pendragon
eugene lacey of commodore user praised the graphics stating that they were smoother and slightly more detailed despite acknowledging that they appeared similar to its predecessor
stuart cooke of your commodore thought the graphics were too repetitive and stated that he had trouble determining which section of the game he was on due to the similarities of all the colours
reviewers of zzap <num> criticised the graphics stating the sprites to be awful and animation as crummy with little or no range of colouring
the sprite of sir arthur pendragon was frequently criticised by reviewers of zzap <num> with one reviewer expressing frustration on why ultimate continued to re @-@ use the same sprites in their games
another reviewer condemned the 3d animation stating that it appeared out of proportion and frustrating
tony hetherington of computer gamer similarly criticised the graphics owing to the duplicated landscapes and identical usage of colours concluding that it was a disappointing game
lacey heralded the gameplay to be purely addicting and considered blackwyche to the best of the series
harding opinionated the game to be miles better than its predecessor whereas cooke thought the gameplay was repetitive owing to its number of locations
reviewers of zzap <num> criticised the overall gameplay stating that the puzzles were poor unchallenging and often gave them the sense of deja @-@ vu with its similarities to its predecessors

i am innocent of these charges that i have been charged of and convicted of and despite the connivance of sabo mcgill and jackson to deny me my so @-@ called rights to represent myself to assistance of my choice to personally select a jury who is totally of my peers to cross @-@ examine witnesses and to make both opening and closing arguments i am still innocent of these charges

however robert harkins testified that he had witnessed a man stand over faulkner as the latter lay wounded on the ground who shot him point @-@ blank in the face and then walked and sat down on the curb
the six judges of the supreme court of pennsylvania ruled unanimously that all issues raised by abu @-@ jamal including the claim of ineffective assistance of counsel were without merit
the supreme court of the united states denied a petition for certiorari against that decision on october <num> <year> enabling ridge to sign a second death warrant on october <num> <year>
its execution in turn was stayed as abu @-@ jamal commenced his pursuit of federal habeas corpus review
in <year> arnold beverly claimed that he and an unnamed assailant not mumia abu @-@ jamal shot daniel faulkner as part of a contract killing because faulkner was interfering with graft and payoff to corrupt police
the beverly affidavit became an item of division for mumia 's defense team as some thought it usable and others rejected beverly 's story as not credible
private investigator george newman claimed in <year> that chobert had recanted his testimony
commentators also noted that police and news photographs of the crime scene did not show chobert 's taxi and that cynthia white the only witness at the trial to testify to seeing the taxi had previously provided crime scene descriptions that omitted it

the driver originally stopped by police officer faulkner abu @-@ jamal 's brother william cook did not testify or make any statement until april <num> <year> when he claimed that he had not seen who had shot faulkner
judge william h
yohn jr
of the united states district court for the eastern district of pennsylvania upheld the conviction but vacated the sentence of death on december <num> <year> citing irregularities in the original process of sentencing
particularly
the jury instructions and verdict sheet in this case involved an unreasonable application of federal law
the charge and verdict form created a reasonable likelihood that the jury believed it was precluded from considering any mitigating circumstance that had not been found unanimously to exist
he ordered the state of pennsylvania to commence new sentencing proceedings within <num> days and ruled that it was unconstitutional to require that a jury 's finding of circumstances mitigating against determining a sentence of death be unanimous
eliot grossman and marlene kamish attorneys for abu @-@ jamal criticized the ruling on the grounds that it denied the possibility of a trial de novo at which they could introduce evidence that their client had been framed
prosecutors also criticized the ruling officer faulkner 's widow maureen described abu @-@ jamal as a remorseless hate @-@ filled killer who would be permitted to enjoy the pleasures that come from simply being alive on the basis of the judgment
both parties appealed
the third circuit court heard oral arguments in the appeals on may <num> <year> at the united states courthouse in philadelphia
the appeal panel consisted of chief judge anthony joseph scirica judge thomas ambro and judge robert cowen
the commonwealth of pennsylvania sought to reinstate the sentence of death on the basis that yohn 's ruling was flawed as he should have deferred to the pennsylvania supreme court which had already ruled on the issue of sentencing and the batson claim was invalid because abu @-@ jamal made no complaints during the original jury selection
although abu @-@ jamal 's jury was racially mixed with <num> blacks and <num> whites at the time of his unanimous conviction his counsel told the third circuit court that abu @-@ jamal did not get a fair trial because the jury was racially biased misinformed the judge was a racist and noted that the prosecution used eleven out of fourteen peremptory challenges to eliminate prospective black jurors
terri maurer @-@ carter a former philadelphia court stenographer claimed in a <year> affidavit nearly <num> years after the trial that she overheard judge sabo say yeah and i 'm going to help them fry the nigger in the course of a conversation with three people present regarding abu @-@ jamal 's case
sabo denied having made any such comment
on march <num> <year> the three @-@ judge panel issued a majority <num> – <num> opinion upholding yohn 's <year> opinion but rejecting the bias and batson claims with judge ambro dissenting on the batson issue
on july <num> <year> abu @-@ jamal 's formal petition seeking reconsideration of the decision by the full third circuit panel of <num> judges was denied
on april <num> <year> the united states supreme court also refused to hear abu @-@ jamal 's appeal allowing his conviction to stand
on january <num> <year> the supreme court ordered the appeals court to reconsider its decision to rescind the death penalty with the same three @-@ judge panel convening in philadelphia on november <num> <year> to hear oral argument

patrick o 'connor editor and publisher of crimemagazine

the last exit was also notable as a popular destination for seattle 's amateur and professional go and chess players including peter biyiasas viktors pupols and yasser seirawan who wrote of the venue those first chess lessons soon led me to the legendary last exit on brooklyn coffee house a chess haven where an unlikely bunch of unusual people congregates to do battle

he also worked in films throughout his career playing more than fifty cinema roles
late in his career he had considerable success in television roles
his family had no theatrical connections but olivier 's father a clergyman decided that his son should become an actor
after attending a drama school in london olivier learned his craft in a succession of acting jobs during the late <num>
in <year> he had his first important west end success in noël coward 's private lives and he appeared in his first film
in <year> he played in a celebrated production of romeo and juliet alongside gielgud and peggy ashcroft and by the end of the decade he was an established star
in the <num> together with richardson and john burrell olivier was the co @-@ director of the old vic building it into a highly respected company
there his most celebrated roles included shakespeare 's richard iii and sophocles 's oedipus
in the <num> olivier was an independent actor @-@ manager but his stage career was in the doldrums until he joined the avant garde english stage company in <year> to play the title role in the entertainer a part he later played on film
from <year> to <year> he was the founding director of britain 's national theatre running a resident company that fostered many future stars
his own parts there included the title role in othello <year> and shylock in the merchant of venice <year>
among olivier 's films are wuthering heights <year> rebecca <year> and a trilogy of shakespeare films as actor @-@ director henry v <year> hamlet <year> and richard iii <year>
his later films included sleuth <year> marathon man <year> and the boys from brazil <year>
his television appearances included an adaptation of the moon and sixpence <year> long day 's journey into night <year> love among the ruins <year> cat on a hot tin roof <year> brideshead revisited <year> and king lear <year>
olivier 's honours included a knighthood <year> a life peerage <year> and the order of merit <year>
for his on @-@ screen work he received four academy awards two british academy film awards five emmy awards and three golden globe awards
the national theatre 's largest auditorium is named in his honour and he is commemorated in the laurence olivier awards given annually by the society of london theatre
he was married three times to the actresses jill esmond from <year> to <year> vivien leigh from <year> to <year> and joan plowright from <year> until his death
their elder children were sybille <year> – <num> and gerard dacres dickie <year> – <num>
his great @-@ great @-@ grandfather was of french huguenot descent and olivier came from a long line of protestant clergymen
gerard olivier had begun a career as a schoolmaster but in his thirties he discovered a strong religious vocation and was ordained as a priest of the church of england
he practised extremely high church ritualist christianity and liked to be addressed as father olivier
this made him unacceptable to most anglican congregations and the only church posts he was offered were temporary usually deputising for regular incumbents in their absence
this meant a nomadic existence and for laurence 's first few years he never lived in one place long enough to make friends
in <year> when olivier was five his father secured a permanent appointment as assistant priest at st saviour 's pimlico
he held the post for six years and a stable family life was at last possible
olivier was devoted to his mother but not to his father whom he found a cold and remote parent
nevertheless he learned a great deal of the art of performing from him
as a young man gerard olivier had considered a stage career and was a dramatic and effective preacher
olivier wrote that his father knew when to drop the voice when to bellow about the perils of hellfire when to slip in a gag when suddenly to wax sentimental
the quick changes of mood and manner absorbed me and i have never forgotten them
in <year> after attending a series of preparatory schools olivier passed the singing examination for admission to the choir school of all saints margaret street in central london
his elder brother was already a pupil and olivier gradually settled in though he felt himself to be something of an outsider
the church 's style of worship was and remains anglo @-@ catholic with emphasis on ritual vestments and incense
the theatricality of the services appealed to olivier and the vicar encouraged the students to develop a taste for secular as well as religious drama
in a school production of julius caesar in <year> the ten @-@ year @-@ old olivier 's performance as brutus impressed an audience that included lady tree the young sybil thorndike and ellen terry who wrote in her diary the small boy who played brutus is already a great actor
he later won praise in other schoolboy productions as maria in twelfth night <year> and katherine in the taming of the shrew <year>
from all saints olivier went on to st edward 's school oxford from <year> to <year>
he made little mark until his final year when he played puck in the school 's production of a midsummer night 's dream his performance was a tour de force that won him popularity among his fellow pupils
in january <year> his brother left england to work in india as a rubber planter
olivier missed him greatly and asked his father how soon he could follow
he recalled in his memoirs that his father replied don 't be such a fool you 're not going to india you 're going on the stage
olivier 's sister had been a student there and was a favourite of elsie fogerty the founder and principal of the school
olivier later speculated that it was on the strength of this that fogerty agreed to award him the bursary
one of olivier 's contemporaries at the school was peggy ashcroft who observed he was rather uncouth in that his sleeves were too short and his hair stood on end but he was intensely lively and great fun
by his own admission he was not a very conscientious student but fogerty liked him and later said that he and ashcroft stood out among her many pupils
on leaving the school after a year olivier gained work with small touring companies before being taken on in <year> by sybil thorndike and her husband lewis casson as a bit @-@ part player understudy and assistant stage manager for their london company
he modelled his performing style on that of gerald du maurier of whom he said he seemed to mutter on stage but had such perfect technique
when i started i was so busy doing a du maurier that no one ever heard a word i said
the shakespearean actors one saw were terrible hams like frank benson
his concern to speak naturally and avoid what he called singing shakespeare 's verse was the cause of much frustration in his early career with critics regularly decrying his delivery
in <year> on thorndike 's recommendation olivier joined the birmingham repertory company
his biographer michael billington describes the birmingham company as olivier 's university where in his second year he was given the chance to play a wide range of important roles including tony lumpkin in she stoops to conquer the title role in uncle vanya and parolles in all 's well that ends well
billington adds that the engagement led to a lifelong friendship with his fellow actor ralph richardson that was to have a decisive effect on the british theatre
while playing the juvenile lead in bird in hand at the royalty theatre in june <year> olivier began a relationship with jill esmond the daughter of the actors henry v
esmond and eva moore
olivier later recounted that he thought she would most certainly do excellent well for a wife
i wasn 't likely to do any better at my age and with my undistinguished track @-@ record so i promptly fell in love with her
in <year> olivier created the role of stanhope in r
c
sherriff 's journey 's end in which he scored a great success at its single sunday night premiere
he was offered the part in the west end production the following year but turned it down in favour of the more glamorous role of beau geste in a stage adaptation of p
c
wren 's <year> novel of the same name
journey 's end became a long @-@ running success beau geste failed
the manchester guardian commented mr
laurence olivier did his best as beau but he deserves and will get better parts
mr
olivier is going to make a big name for himself
for the rest of <year> olivier appeared in seven plays all of which were short @-@ lived
billington ascribes this failure rate to poor choices by olivier rather than mere bad luck
in april he travelled to berlin to film the english @-@ language version of the temporary widow a crime comedy with lilian harvey and in may he spent four nights working on another comedy too many crooks
during work on the latter film for which he was paid £ <num> he met laurence evans who became his personal manager
olivier did not enjoy working in film which he dismissed as this anaemic little medium which could not stand great acting but financially it was much more rewarding than his theatre work
olivier and esmond married on <num> july <year> at all saints margaret street although within weeks both realised they had erred
olivier later recorded that the marriage was a pretty crass mistake
i insisted on getting married from a pathetic mixture of religious and animal promptings
she had admitted to me that she was in love elsewhere and could never love me as completely as i would wish
olivier later recounted that following the wedding he did not keep a diary for ten years and never followed religious practices again although he considered those facts to be mere coincidence unconnected to the nuptials
in <year> noël coward cast olivier as victor prynne in his new play private lives which opened at the new phoenix theatre in london in september
coward and gertrude lawrence played the lead roles elyot chase and amanda prynne
victor is a secondary character along with sybil chase the author called them extra puppets lightly wooden ninepins only to be repeatedly knocked down and stood up again
to make them credible spouses for amanda and elyot coward was determined that two outstandingly attractive performers should play the parts
olivier played victor in the west end and then on broadway adrianne allen was sybil in london but could not go to new york where the part was taken by esmond
in addition to giving the <num> @-@ year @-@ old olivier his first successful west end role coward became something of a mentor
in the late <num> olivier told sheridan morley he gave me a sense of balance of right and wrong
he would make me read i never used to read anything at all
i remember he said right my boy wuthering heights of human bondage and the old wives tale by arnold bennett
that 'll do those are three of the best
read them
i did
noël also did a priceless thing he taught me not to giggle on the stage
once already i 'd been fired for doing it and i was very nearly sacked from the birmingham rep
for the same reason
noël cured me by trying to make me laugh outrageously he taught me how not to give in to it
my great triumph came in new york when one night i managed to break noël up on the stage without giggling myself
in <year> rko pictures offered olivier a two @-@ film contract at <num> @,@ <num> a week he discussed the possibility with coward who irked told olivier you 've no artistic integrity that 's your trouble this is how you cheapen yourself
he accepted and moved to hollywood despite some misgivings
his first film was the drama friends and lovers in a supporting role before rko loaned him to fox studios for his first film lead a british journalist in a russia under martial law in the yellow passport alongside elissa landi and lionel barrymore
the cultural historian jeffrey richards describes olivier 's look as an attempt by fox studios to produce a likeness of ronald colman and colman 's moustache voice and manner are perfectly reproduced
olivier returned to rko to complete his contract with the <year> drama westward passage which was a commercial failure
olivier 's initial foray into american films had not provided the breakthrough he hoped for disillusioned with hollywood he returned to london where he appeared in two british films perfect understanding with gloria swanson and no funny business — in which esmond also appeared
he was tempted back to hollywood in <year> to appear opposite greta garbo in queen christina but was replaced after two weeks of filming because of a lack of chemistry between the two
olivier 's stage roles in <year> included bothwell in gordon daviot 's queen of scots which was only a moderate success for him and for the play but led to an important engagement for the same management bronson albery shortly afterwards
in the interim he had a great success playing a thinly disguised version of the american actor john barrymore in edna furber 's theatre royal
his success was vitiated by his breaking an ankle two months into the run in one of the athletic acrobatic stunts with which he liked to enliven his performances
in <year> under albery 's management john gielgud staged romeo and juliet at the new theatre co @-@ starring with peggy ashcroft edith evans and olivier
gielgud had seen olivier in queen of scots spotted his potential and now gave him a major step up in his career
for the first weeks of the run gielgud played mercutio and olivier played romeo after which they exchanged roles
the production broke all box @-@ office records for the play running for <num> performances
olivier was enraged at the notices after the first night which praised the virility of his performance but fiercely criticised his speaking of shakespeare 's verse contrasting it with his co @-@ star 's mastery of the poetry
the friendship between the two men was prickly on olivier 's side for the rest of his life
b
priestley bees on the boatdeck
both actors won excellent notices but the play an allegory of britain 's decay did not attract the public and closed after four weeks
later in the same year olivier accepted an invitation to join the old vic company
the theatre in an unfashionable location south of the thames had offered inexpensive tickets for opera and drama under its proprietor lilian baylis since <year>
her drama company specialised in the plays of shakespeare and many leading actors had taken very large cuts in their pay to develop their shakespearean techniques there
gielgud had been in the company from <year> to <year> and richardson from <year> to <year>
among the actors whom olivier joined in late <year> were edith evans ruth gordon alec guinness and michael redgrave
in january <year> he took the title role in an uncut version of hamlet in which once again his delivery of the verse was unfavourably compared with that of gielgud who had played the role on the same stage seven years previously to enormous acclaim
the observer 's ivor brown praised olivier 's magnetism and muscularity but missed the kind of pathos so richly established by mr gielgud
the reviewer in the times found the performance full of vitality but at times too light
the character slips from mr olivier 's grasp
after hamlet the company presented twelfth night in what the director tyrone guthrie summed up as a baddish immature production of mine with olivier outrageously amusing as sir toby and a very young alec guinness outrageous and more amusing as sir andrew
henry v was the next play presented in may to mark the coronation of george vi
a pacifist as he then was olivier was as reluctant to play the warrior king as guthrie was to direct the piece but the production was a success and baylis had to extend the run from four to eight weeks
following olivier 's success in shakespearean stage productions he made his first foray into shakespeare on film in <year> as orlando in as you like it directed by paul czinner a charming if lightweight production according to michael brooke of the british film institute 's bfi 's screenonline
the following year olivier appeared alongside vivien leigh in the historical drama fire over england
he had first met leigh briefly at the savoy grill and then again when she visited him during the run of romeo and juliet probably early in <year> and the two had begun an affair sometime that year
of the relationship olivier later said that i couldn 't help myself with vivien
no man could
i hated myself for cheating on jill but then i had cheated before but this was something different
this wasn 't just out of lust
this was love that i really didn 't ask for but was drawn into
while his relationship with leigh continued he conducted an affair with the actress ann todd and possibly had a homosexual fling with the actor henry ainley according to the biographer michael munn
in june <year> the old vic company took up an invitation to perform hamlet in the courtyard of the castle at elsinore where shakespeare located the play
olivier secured the casting of leigh to replace cherry cottrell as ophelia
because of torrential rain the performance had to be moved from the castle courtyard to the ballroom of a local hotel but the tradition of playing hamlet at elsinore was established and olivier was followed by among others gielgud <year> redgrave <year> richard burton <year> derek jacobi <year> kenneth branagh <year> and jude law <year>
back in london the company staged macbeth with olivier in the title role
the stylised production by michel saint @-@ denis was not well liked but olivier had some good notices among the bad
on returning from denmark olivier and leigh told their respective spouses about the affair and that their marriages were over esmond moved out of the marital house and in with her mother
after olivier and leigh made a tour of europe in mid <year> they returned to separate film projects — a yank at oxford for her and the divorce of lady x for him — and moved into a property together in iver buckinghamshire
olivier returned to the old vic for a second season in <year>
for othello he played iago with richardson in the title role
guthrie wanted to experiment with the theory that iago 's villainy is driven by suppressed homosexual love for othello
olivier was willing to co @-@ operate but richardson was not audiences and most critics failed to spot the supposed motivation of olivier 's iago and richardson 's othello seemed underpowered
after that comparative failure the company had a success with coriolanus starring olivier in the title role
the notices were laudatory mentioning him alongside great predecessors such as edmund kean william macready and henry irving
the actor robert speaight described it as olivier 's first incontestably great performance
this was olivier 's last appearance on a london stage for six years
frank nugent the critic for the new york times thought olivier was not quite so good as richardson but was quite acceptable
in late <year> lured by a salary of <num> @,@ <num> the actor travelled to hollywood to take the part of heathcliff in the <year> film wuthering heights alongside merle oberon and david niven
in less than a month leigh had joined him explaining that her trip was partially because larry 's there and partially because i intend to get the part of scarlett o 'hara — the role in gone with the wind in which she was eventually cast
olivier did not enjoy making wuthering heights and his approach to film acting combined with a dislike for oberon led to tensions on set
the director william wyler was a hard taskmaster and olivier learned to remove what billington described as the carapace of theatricality to which he was prone replacing it with a palpable reality
the resulting film was a commercial and critical success that earned him a nomination for the academy award for best actor and created his screen reputation
caroline lejeune writing for the observer considered that olivier 's dark moody face abrupt style and a certain fine arrogance towards the world in his playing are just right in the role while the reviewer for the times wrote that olivier is a good embodiment of heathcliff
impressive enough on a more human plane speaking his lines with real distinction and always both romantic and alive
after returning to london briefly in mid @-@ <year> the couple returned to america leigh to film the final takes for gone with the wind and olivier to prepare for filming of alfred hitchcock 's rebecca — although the couple had hoped to appear in it together
instead joan fontaine was selected for the role of mrs de winter as the producer david o
selznick thought that not only was she more suitable for the role but that it was best to keep olivier and leigh apart until their divorces came through
olivier followed rebecca with pride and prejudice in the role of mr
darcy
to his disappointment elizabeth bennet was played by greer garson rather than leigh
he received good reviews for both films and showed a more confident screen presence than he had in his early work
in january <year> olivier and esmond were granted their divorce
in february following another request from leigh her husband also applied for their marriage to be terminated
on stage olivier and leigh starred in romeo and juliet on broadway
it was an extravagant production but a commercial failure
in the new york times brooks atkinson praised the scenery but not the acting although miss leigh and mr olivier are handsome young people they hardly act their parts at all
the couple had invested almost all their savings in the project and its failure was a grave financial blow
they were married in august <year> at the san ysidro ranch in santa barbara
the war in europe had been under way for a year and was going badly for britain
after his wedding olivier wanted to help the war effort
he telephoned duff cooper the minister of information under winston churchill hoping to get a position in cooper 's department
cooper advised him to remain where he was and speak to the film director alexander korda who was based in the us at churchill 's behest with connections to british intelligence
korda — with churchill 's support and involvement — directed that hamilton woman with olivier as horatio nelson and leigh in the title role
korda saw that the relationship between the couple was strained
olivier was tiring of leigh 's suffocating adulation and she was drinking to excess
the film in which the threat of napoleon paralleled that of hitler was seen by critics as bad history but good british propaganda according to the bfi
olivier 's life was under threat from the nazis and pro @-@ german sympathisers
the studio owners were concerned enough that samuel goldwyn and cecil b
demille both provided support and security to ensure his safety
on the completion of filming olivier and leigh returned to britain
he had spent the previous year learning to fly and had completed nearly <num> hours by the time he left america
he intended to join the royal air force but instead made another propaganda film <num> parallel narrated short pieces for the ministry of information and joined the fleet air arm because richardson was already in the service
richardson had gained a reputation for crashing aircraft which olivier rapidly eclipsed
olivier and leigh settled in a cottage just outside raf worthy down where he was stationed with a training squadron noël coward visited the couple and thought olivier looked unhappy
olivier spent much of his time taking part in broadcasts and making speeches to build morale and in <year> he was invited to make another propaganda film the demi @-@ paradise in which he played a soviet engineer who helps improve british @-@ russian relationships
in <year> at the behest of the ministry of information olivier began working on henry v
originally he had no intention of taking the directorial duties but ended up directing and producing in addition to taking the title role
he was assisted by an italian internee filippo del giudice who had been released to produce propaganda for the allied cause
the decision was made to film the battle scenes in neutral eire where it was easier to find the <num> extras
john betjeman the press attaché at the british embassy in dublin played a key liaison role with the irish government in making suitable arrangements
the film was released in november <year>
brooke writing for the bfi considers that it came too late in the second world war to be a call to arms as such but formed a powerful reminder of what britain was defending
the music for the film was written by william walton a score that ranks with the best in film music according to the music critic michael kennedy
walton also provided the music for olivier 's next two shakespearean adaptations hamlet <year> and richard iii <year>
henry v was warmly received by critics
the reviewer for the manchester guardian wrote that the film combined new art hand @-@ in @-@ hand with old genius and both superbly of one mind in a film that worked triumphantly
the critic for the times considered that olivier plays henry on a high heroic note and never is there danger of a crack in a film described as a triumph of film craft
there were oscar nominations for the film including best picture and best actor but it won none and olivier was instead presented with a special award
he was unimpressed and later commented that this was my first absolute fob @-@ off and i regarded it as such
a small troupe toured the provinces with sybil thorndike at its head
by <year> with the tide of the war turning guthrie felt it time to re @-@ establish the company in a london base and invited richardson to head it
richardson made it a condition of accepting that he should share the acting and management in a triumvirate
initially he proposed gielgud and olivier as his colleagues but the former declined saying it would be a disaster you would have to spend your whole time as referee between larry and me
it was finally agreed that the third member would be the stage director john burrell
the old vic governors approached the royal navy to secure the release of richardson and olivier the sea lords consented with as olivier put it a speediness and lack of reluctance which was positively hurtful
the triumvirate secured the new theatre for their first season and recruited a company
thorndike was joined by among others harcourt williams joyce redman and margaret leighton
it was agreed to open with a repertory of four plays peer gynt arms and the man richard iii and uncle vanya
olivier 's roles were the button moulder sergius richard and astrov richardson played peer bluntschli richmond and vanya
the first three productions met with acclaim from reviewers and audiences uncle vanya had a mixed reception although the times thought olivier 's astrov a most distinguished portrait and richardson 's vanya the perfect compound of absurdity and pathos
in richard iii according to billington olivier 's triumph was absolute so much so that it became his most frequently imitated performance and one whose supremacy went unchallenged until antony sher played the role forty years later
in <year> the company toured germany where they were seen by many thousands of allied servicemen they also appeared at the comédie @-@ française theatre in paris the first foreign company to be given that honour
the critic harold hobson wrote that richardson and olivier quickly made the old vic the most famous theatre in the anglo @-@ saxon world
the second season in <year> featured two double bills
the first consisted of henry iv parts <num> and <num>
olivier played the warrior hotspur in the first and the doddering justice shallow in the second
he received good notices but by general consent the production belonged to richardson as falstaff
in the second double bill it was olivier who dominated in the title roles of oedipus rex and the critic
in the two one @-@ act plays his switch from searing tragedy and horror in the first half to farcical comedy in the second impressed most critics and audience members though a minority felt that the transformation from sophocles 's bloodily blinded hero to sheridan 's vain and ludicrous mr puff smacked of a quick @-@ change turn in a music hall
after the london season the company played both the double bills and uncle vanya in a six @-@ week run on broadway
the third and final london season under the triumvirate was in <year> – <num>
olivier played king lear and richardson took the title role in cyrano de bergerac
olivier would have preferred the roles to be reversed but richardson did not wish to attempt lear
olivier 's lear received good but not outstanding reviews
in his scenes of decline and madness towards the end of the play some critics found him less moving than his finest predecessors in the role
the influential critic james agate suggested that olivier used his dazzling stage technique to disguise a lack of feeling a charge that the actor strongly rejected but which was often made throughout his later career
during the run of cyrano richardson was knighted to olivier 's undisguised envy
the younger man received the accolade six months later by which time the days of the triumvirate were numbered
the high profile of the two star actors did not endear them to the new chairman of the old vic governors lord esher
he had ambitions to be the first head of the national theatre and had no intention of letting actors run it
he was encouraged by guthrie who having instigated the appointment of richardson and olivier had come to resent their knighthoods and international fame
in january <year> olivier began working on his second film as a director hamlet <year> in which he also took the lead role
the original play was heavily cut to focus on the relationships rather than the political intrigue
the film became a critical and commercial success in britain and abroad although lejeune in the observer considered it less effective than olivier 's stage work
he speaks the lines nobly and with the caress of one who loves them but he nullifies his own thesis by never for a moment leaving the impression of a man who cannot make up his own mind here you feel rather is an actor @-@ producer @-@ director who in every circumstance knows exactly what he wants and gets it
campbell dixon the critic for the daily telegraph thought the film brilliant
one of the masterpieces of the stage has been made into one of the greatest of films
hamlet became the first non @-@ american film to win the academy award for best picture while olivier won the award for best actor
in <year> olivier led the old vic company on a six @-@ month tour of australia and new zealand
he played richard iii sir peter teazle in sheridan 's the school for scandal and antrobus in thornton wilder 's the skin of our teeth appearing alongside leigh in the latter two plays
while olivier was on the australian tour and richardson was in hollywood esher terminated the contracts of the three directors who were said to have resigned
melvyn bragg in a <year> study of olivier and john miller in the authorised biography of richardson both comment that esher 's action put back the establishment of a national theatre for at least a decade
looking back in <year> bernard levin wrote that the old vic company of <year> to <year> was probably the most illustrious that has ever been assembled in this country
the times said that the triumvirate 's years were the greatest in the old vic 's history as the guardian put it the governors summarily sacked them in the interests of a more mediocre company spirit
later he would comment that he lost vivien in australia a reference to leigh 's affair with the australian actor peter finch whom the couple met during the tour
shortly afterwards finch moved to london where olivier auditioned him and put him under a long @-@ term contract with laurence olivier productions
finch and leigh 's affair continued on and off for several years
although it was common knowledge that the old vic triumvirate had been dismissed they refused to be drawn on the matter in public and olivier even arranged to play a final london season with the company in <year> as richard iii sir peter teazle and chorus in his own production of anouilh 's antigone with leigh in the title role
after that he was free to embark on a new career as an actor @-@ manager
in partnership with binkie beaumont he staged the english premiere of tennessee williams 's a streetcar named desire with leigh in the central role of blanche dubois
the play was condemned by most critics but the production was a considerable commercial success and led to leigh 's casting as blanche in the <year> film version
gielgud who was a devoted friend of leigh 's doubted whether olivier was wise to let her play the demanding role of the mentally unstable heroine blanche was so very like her in a way
it must have been a most dreadful strain to do it night after night
she would be shaking and white and quite distraught at the end of it
the production company set up by olivier took a lease on the st james 's theatre
in january <year> he produced directed and starred in christopher fry 's verse play venus observed
the production was popular despite poor reviews but the expensive production did little to help the finances of laurence olivier productions
after a series of box @-@ office failures the company balanced its books in <year> with productions of shaw 's caesar and cleopatra and shakespeare 's antony and cleopatra which the oliviers played in london and then took to broadway
olivier was thought by some critics to be under par in both his roles and some suspected him of playing deliberately below his usual strength so that leigh might appear his equal
olivier dismissed the suggestion regarding it as an insult to his integrity as an actor
in the view of the critic and biographer w
a
darlington he was simply miscast both as caesar and antony finding the former boring and the latter weak
darlington comments olivier in his middle forties when he should have been displaying his powers at their very peak seemed to have lost interest in his own acting
over the next four years olivier spent much of his time working as a producer presenting plays rather than directing or acting in them
his presentations at the st james 's included seasons by ruggero ruggeri 's company giving two pirandello plays in italian followed by a visit from the comédie @-@ française playing works by molière racine marivaux and musset in french
darlington considers a <year> production of othello starring orson welles as the pick of olivier 's productions at the theatre
olivier began to notice a change in leigh 's behaviour and he later recounted that i would find vivien sitting on the corner of the bed wringing her hands and sobbing in a state of grave distress i would naturally try desperately to give her some comfort but for some time she would be inconsolable
after a holiday with coward in jamaica she seemed to have recovered but olivier later recorded i am sure that
the doctors must have taken some pains to tell me what was wrong with my wife that her disease was called manic depression and what that meant — a possibly permanent cyclical to @-@ and @-@ fro between the depths of depression and wild uncontrollable mania
he also recounted the years of problems he had experienced because of leigh 's illness writing throughout her possession by that uncannily evil monster manic depression with its deadly ever @-@ tightening spirals she retained her own individual canniness — an ability to disguise her true mental condition from almost all except me for whom she could hardly be expected to take the trouble
in january <year> leigh travelled to ceylon now sri lanka to film elephant walk with peter finch
shortly after filming started she suffered a breakdown and returned to britain where between periods of incoherence she told olivier that she was in love with finch and had been having an affair with him she gradually recovered over a period of several months
as a result of the breakdown many of the oliviers friends learned of her problems
niven said she had been quite quite mad and in his diary coward expressed the view that things had been bad and getting worse since <year> or thereabouts
for the coronation season of <year> olivier and leigh starred in the west end in terence rattigan 's ruritanian comedy the sleeping prince
it ran for eight months but was widely regarded as a minor contribution to the season in which other productions included gielgud in venice preserv 'd coward in the apple cart and ashcroft and redgrave in antony and cleopatra
olivier directed his third shakespeare film in september <year> richard iii <year> which he co @-@ produced with korda
the presence of four theatrical knights in the one film — olivier was joined by cedric hardwicke gielgud and richardson — led an american reviewer to dub it an @-@ all @-@ sir @-@ cast
the critic for the manchester guardian described the film as a bold and successful achievement but it was not a box @-@ office success which accounted for olivier 's subsequent failure to raise the funds for a planned film of macbeth
he won a bafta award for the role and was nominated for the best actor academy award which yul brynner won
they began with twelfth night directed by gielgud with olivier as malvolio and leigh as viola
rehearsals were difficult with olivier determined to play his conception of the role despite the director 's view that it was vulgar
gielgud later commented somehow the production did not work
olivier was set on playing malvolio in his own particular rather extravagant way
he was extremely moving at the end but he played the earlier scenes like a jewish hairdresser with a lisp and an extraordinary accent and he insisted on falling backwards off a bench in the garden scene though i begged him not to do it
but then malvolio is a very difficult part
the next production was macbeth
reviewers were lukewarm about the direction by glen byam shaw and the designs by roger furse but olivier 's performance in the title role attracted superlatives
to j
c
trewin olivier 's was the finest macbeth of our day to darlington it was the best macbeth of our time
leigh 's lady macbeth received mixed but generally polite notices although to the end of his life olivier believed it to have been the best lady macbeth he ever saw
in their third production of the <year> stratford season olivier played the title role in titus andronicus with leigh as lavinia
her notices in the part were damning but the production by peter brook and olivier 's performance as titus received the greatest ovation in stratford history from the first @-@ night audience and the critics hailed the production as a landmark in post @-@ war british theatre
olivier and brook revived the production for a continental tour in june <year> its final performance which closed the old stoll theatre in london was the last time leigh and olivier acted together
leigh became pregnant in <year> and withdrew from the production of coward 's comedy south sea bubble
the day after her final performance in the play she miscarried and entered a period of depression that lasted for months
the same year olivier decided to direct and produce a film version of the sleeping prince retitled the prince and the showgirl
instead of appearing with leigh he cast marilyn monroe as the showgirl
although the filming was challenging because of monroe 's behaviour the film was appreciated by the critics
olivier had seen the play earlier in the run and disliked it but miller was convinced that osborne had talent and olivier reconsidered
he was ready for a change of direction in <year> he wrote i had reached a stage in my life that i was getting profoundly sick of — not just tired — sick
consequently the public were likely enough beginning to agree with me
my rhythm of work had become a bit deadly a classical or semi @-@ classical film a play or two at stratford or a nine @-@ month run in the west end etc etc
i was going mad desperately searching for something suddenly fresh and thrillingly exciting
what i felt to be my image was boring me to death
osborne was already at work on a new play the entertainer an allegory of britain 's post @-@ colonial decline centred on a seedy variety comedian archie rice
having read the first act — all that was completed by then — olivier asked to be cast in the part
he had for years maintained that he might easily have been a third @-@ rate comedian called larry oliver and would sometimes play the character at parties
behind archie 's brazen façade there is a deep desolation and olivier caught both aspects switching in the words of the biographer anthony holden from a gleefully tacky comic routine to moments of the most wrenching pathos
tony richardson 's production for the english stage company transferred from the royal court to the palace theatre in september <year> after that it toured and returned to the palace
the role of archie 's daughter jean was taken by three actresses during the various runs
the second of them was joan plowright with whom olivier began a relationship that endured for the rest of his life
olivier said that playing archie made me feel like a modern actor again
in finding an avant @-@ garde play that suited him he was as osborne remarked far ahead of gielgud and ralph richardson who did not successfully follow his lead for more than a decade
their first substantial successes in works by any of osborne 's generation were alan bennett 's forty years on gielgud in <year> and david storey 's home richardson and gielgud in <year>
olivier received another bafta nomination for his supporting role in <year> 's the devil 's disciple
the same year after a gap of two decades olivier returned to the role of coriolanus in a stratford production directed by the <num> @-@ year @-@ old peter hall
olivier 's performance received strong praise from the critics for its fierce athleticism combined with an emotional vulnerability
in <year> he made his second appearance for the royal court company in ionesco 's absurdist play rhinoceros
the production was chiefly remarkable for the star 's quarrels with the director orson welles who according to the biographer francis beckett suffered the appalling treatment that olivier had inflicted on gielgud at stratford five years earlier
olivier again ignored his director and undermined his authority
in <year> and <year> olivier appeared in anouilh 's becket on broadway first in the title role with anthony quinn as the king and later exchanging roles with his co @-@ star
two films featuring olivier were released in <year>
the first — filmed in <year> — was spartacus in which he portrayed the roman general marcus licinius crassus
his second was the entertainer shot while he was appearing in coriolanus the film was well received by the critics but not as warmly as the stage show had been
the reviewer for the guardian thought the performances were good and wrote that olivier on the screen as on the stage achieves the tour de force of bringing archie rice
to life
for his performance olivier was nominated for the academy award for best actor
he also made an adaptation of the moon and sixpence in <year> winning an emmy award
the oliviers marriage was disintegrating during the late <num>
while directing charlton heston in the <year> play the tumbler olivier divulged that vivien is several thousand miles away trembling on the edge of a cliff even when she 's sitting quietly in her own drawing room at a time when she was threatening suicide
in may <year> divorce proceedings started leigh reported the fact to the press and informed reporters of olivier 's relationship with plowright
the decree nisi was issued in december <year> which enabled him to marry plowright in march <year>
a son richard was born in december <year> two daughters followed tamsin agnes margaret — born in january <year> — and julie @-@ kate born in july <year>
in <year> olivier accepted the directorship of a new theatrical venture the chichester festival
for the opening season in <year> he directed two neglected <num> @-@ century english plays john fletcher 's <year> comedy the chances and john ford 's <year> tragedy the broken heart followed by uncle vanya
the company he recruited was forty strong and included thorndike casson redgrave athene seyler john neville and plowright
the first two plays were politely received the chekhov production attracted rapturous notices
the times commented it is doubtful if the moscow arts theatre itself could improve on this production
the second chichester season the following year consisted of a revival of uncle vanya and two new productions — shaw 's saint joan and john arden 's the workhouse donkey
in <year> olivier received another bafta nomination for his leading role as a schoolteacher accused of sexually molesting a student in the film term of trial
the british government agreed to release funds for a new building on the south bank of the thames
lord chandos was appointed chairman of the national theatre board in <year> and in august olivier accepted its invitation to be the company 's first director
as his assistants he recruited the directors john dexter and william gaskill with kenneth tynan as literary adviser or dramaturge
pending the construction of the new theatre the company was based at the old vic
with the agreement of both organisations olivier remained in overall charge of the chichester festival during the first three seasons of the national he used the festivals of <year> and <year> to give preliminary runs to plays he hoped to stage at the old vic
the opening production of the national theatre was hamlet in october <year> starring peter o 'toole and directed by olivier
o 'toole was a guest star one of occasional exceptions to olivier 's policy of casting productions from a regular company
among those who made a mark during olivier 's directorship were michael gambon maggie smith alan bates derek jacobi and anthony hopkins
it was widely remarked that olivier seemed reluctant to recruit his peers to perform with his company
evans gielgud and paul scofield guested only briefly and ashcroft and richardson never appeared at the national during olivier 's time
robert stephens a member of the company observed olivier 's one great fault was a paranoid jealousy of anyone who he thought was a rival
in his decade in charge of the national olivier acted in thirteen plays and directed eight
several of the roles he played were minor characters including a crazed butler in feydeau 's a flea in her ear and a pompous solicitor in maugham 's home and beauty the vulgar soldier captain brazen in farquhar 's <year> comedy the recruiting officer was a larger role but not the leading one
apart from his astrov in the uncle vanya familiar from chichester his first leading role for the national was othello directed by dexter in <year>
the production was a box @-@ office success and was revived regularly over the next five seasons
his performance divided opinion
most of the reviewers and theatrical colleagues praised it highly franco zeffirelli called it an anthology of everything that has been discovered about acting in the past three centuries
dissenting voices included the sunday telegraph which called it the kind of bad acting of which only a great actor is capable
near the frontiers of self @-@ parody the director jonathan miller thought it a condescending view of an afro caribbean person
the burden of playing this demanding part at the same time as managing the new company and planning for the move to the new theatre took its toll on olivier
to add to his load he felt obliged to take over as solness in the master builder when the ailing redgrave withdrew from the role in november <year>
for the first time olivier began to suffer from stage fright which plagued him for several years
the national theatre production of othello was released as a film in <year> which earned four academy award nominations including another for best actor for olivier
during the following year olivier concentrated on management directing one production the crucible taking the comic role of the foppish tattle in congreve 's love for love and making one film bunny lake is missing in which he and coward were on the same bill for the first time since private lives
in <year> his one play as director was juno and the paycock
the times commented that the production restores one 's faith in the work as a masterpiece
in the same year olivier portrayed the mahdi opposite heston as general gordon in the film khartoum
in <year> olivier was caught in the middle of a confrontation between chandos and tynan over the latter 's proposal to stage rolf hochhuth 's soldiers
as the play speculatively depicted churchill as complicit in the assassination of the polish prime minister władysław sikorski chandos regarded it as indefensible
at his urging the board unanimously vetoed the production
tynan considered resigning over this interference with the management 's artistic freedom but olivier himself stayed firmly in place and tynan also remained
at about this time olivier began a long struggle against a succession of illnesses
he was treated for prostate cancer and during rehearsals for his production of chekhov 's three sisters he was hospitalised with pneumonia
he recovered enough to take the heavy role of edgar in strindberg 's the dance of death the finest of all his performances other than in shakespeare in gielgud 's view
by <year> because of bureaucratic delays construction work had not even begun and he agreed to serve for a second five @-@ year term
his next major role and his last appearance in a shakespeare play was as shylock in the merchant of venice his first appearance in the work
he had intended guinness or scofield to play shylock but stepped in when neither was available
the production by jonathan miller and olivier 's performance attracted a wide range of responses
two different critics reviewed it for the guardian one wrote this is not a role which stretches him or for which he will be particularly remembered the other commented that the performance ranks as one of his greatest achievements involving his whole range
in <year> olivier appeared in two war films portraying military leaders
he played field marshal french in the first world war film oh what a lovely war for which he won another bafta award followed by air chief marshal hugh dowding in battle of britain
in june <year> he became the first actor to be created a peer for services to the theatre
although he initially declined the honour harold wilson the incumbent prime minister wrote to him then invited him and plowright to dinner and persuaded him to accept
after this olivier played three more stage roles james tyrone in eugene o 'neill 's long day 's journey into night <year> – <num> antonio in eduardo de filippo 's saturday sunday monday and john tagg in trevor griffiths 's the party both <year> – <num>
among the roles he hoped to play but could not because of ill @-@ health was nathan detroit in the musical guys and dolls
in <year> he took leave of absence from the national to star opposite michael caine in joseph l
mankiewicz 's film of anthony shaffer 's sleuth which the illustrated london news considered to be olivier at his twinkling eye @-@ rolling best both he and caine were nominated for the academy award for best actor losing to marlon brando in the godfather
the last two stage plays olivier directed were jean giradoux 's amphitryon <year> and priestley 's eden end <year>
by the time of eden end he was no longer director of the national theatre peter hall took over on <num> november <year>
the succession was tactlessly handled by the board and olivier felt that he had been eased out — although he had declared his intention to go — and that he had not been properly consulted about the choice of successor
the largest of the three theatres within the national 's new building was named in his honour but his only appearance on the stage of the olivier theatre was at its official opening by the queen in october <year> when he made a speech of welcome which hall privately described as the most successful part of the evening
professionally and to secure financial security he made a series of advertisements for polaroid cameras in <year> although he stipulated that they must never be shown in britain he also took a number of cameo film roles which were in often undistinguished films according to billington
olivier 's move from leading parts to supporting and cameo roles came about because his poor health meant he could not get the necessary long insurance for larger parts with only short engagements in films available
olivier 's dermatomyositis meant he spent the last three months of <year> in hospital and he spent early <year> slowly recovering and regaining his strength
when strong enough he was contacted by the director john schlesinger who offered him the role of a nazi torturer in the <year> film marathon man
olivier shaved his pate and wore oversized glasses to enlarge the look of his eyes in a role that the critic david robinson writing for the times thought was strongly played adding that olivier was always at his best in roles that call for him to be seedy or nasty or both
olivier was nominated for the academy award for best actor in a supporting role and won the golden globe of the same category
in the mid @-@ <num> olivier became increasingly involved in television work a medium of which he was initially dismissive
in <year> he provided the narration for a <num> @-@ episode documentary the world at war which chronicled the events of the second world war and won a second emmy award for long day 's journey into night <year>
in <year> he won another emmy for love among the ruins
the following year he appeared in adaptations of tennessee williams 's cat on a hot tin roof and harold pinter 's the collection
in <year> he appeared in the film the boys from brazil playing the role of ezra lieberman an ageing nazi hunter he received his eleventh academy award nomination
although he did not win the oscar he was presented with an honorary award for his lifetime achievement
olivier continued working in film into the <num> with roles in the jazz singer <year> inchon <year> the bounty <year> and wild geese ii <year>
he continued to work in television in <year> he appeared as lord marchmain in brideshead revisited winning another emmy and the following year he received his tenth and last bafta nomination in the television adaptation of john mortimer 's stage play a voyage round my father
in <year> he played his last shakespearean role as lear in king lear for granada television earning his fifth emmy
he thought the role of lear much less demanding than other tragic shakespearean heroes no lear is easy
he 's like all of us really he 's just a stupid old fart
when the production was first shown on american television the critic steve vineberg wrote olivier seems to have thrown away technique this time — his is a breathtakingly pure lear
in his final speech over cordelia 's lifeless body he brings us so close to lear 's sorrow that we can hardly bear to watch because we have seen the last shakespearean hero laurence olivier will ever play
but what a finale in this most sublime of plays our greatest actor has given an indelible performance
perhaps it would be most appropriate to express simple gratitude
the same year he also appeared in a cameo alongside gielgud and richardson in wagner with burton in the title role his final screen appearance was as an old wheelchair @-@ bound soldier in derek jarman 's <year> film war requiem
after being ill for the last twenty @-@ two years of his life olivier died of renal failure on <num> july <year> at his home near steyning west sussex
his cremation was held three days later before a funeral in poets corner of westminster abbey in october that year
he also received honours from foreign governments
in <year> he was made commander of the order of the dannebrog by the danish government the french appointed him officier legion of honour in <year> the italian government created him grande ufficiale order of merit of the italian republic in <year> and in <year> he was granted the order of yugoslav flag with golden wreath
from academic and other institutions olivier received honorary doctorates from the university of tufts massachusetts <year> oxford <year> and edinburgh <year>
he was also awarded the danish sonning prize in <year> the gold medallion of the royal swedish academy of letters history and antiquities in <year> and the albert medal of the royal society of arts in <year>
for his work in films olivier received four academy awards an honorary award for henry v <year> a best actor award and one as producer for hamlet <year> and a second honorary award in <year> to recognise his lifetime of contribution to the art of film
he was nominated for nine other acting oscars and one each for production and direction
he also won two british academy film awards out of ten nominations five emmy awards out of nine nominations and three golden globe awards out of six nominations
he was nominated once for a tony award for best actor as archie rice but did not win
in february <year> for his contribution to the film industry olivier was inducted into the hollywood walk of fame with a star at <num> hollywood boulevard he is included in the american theater hall of fame
in <year> olivier was awarded a british film institute fellowship
in addition to the naming of the national theatre 's largest auditorium in olivier 's honour he is commemorated in the laurence olivier awards bestowed annually since <year> by the society of west end theatre
in <year> gielgud unveiled a memorial stone commemorating olivier in poets corner at westminster abbey
in <year> the centenary of olivier 's birth a life @-@ sized statue of him was unveiled on the south bank outside the national theatre the same year the bfi held a retrospective season of his film work
by his own admission he was addicted to extravagant make @-@ up and unlike richardson and gielgud he excelled at different voices and accents
his own description of his technique was working from the outside in he said i can never act as myself i have to have a pillow up my jumper a false nose or a moustache or wig
i cannot come on looking like me and be someone else
rattigan described how at rehearsals olivier built his performance slowly and with immense application from a mass of tiny details
this attention to detail had its critics agate remarked when i look at a watch it is to see the time and not to admire the mechanism
i want an actor to tell me lear 's time of day and olivier doesn 't
he bids me watch the wheels go round
tynan remarked to olivier you aren 't really a contemplative or philosophical actor olivier was known for the strenuous physicality of his performances in some roles
he told tynan this was because he was influenced as a young man by douglas fairbanks ramon navarro and john barrymore in films and barrymore on stage as hamlet tremendously athletic
i admired that greatly all of us did
one thought of oneself idiotically skinny as i was as a sort of tarzan
according to morley gielgud was widely considered the best actor in the world from the neck up and olivier from the neck down
olivier described the contrast thus i 've always thought that we were the reverses of the same coin
the top half john all spirituality all beauty all abstract things and myself as all earth blood humanity
together with richardson and gielgud olivier was internationally recognised as one of the great trinity of theatrical knights who dominated the british stage during the middle and later decades of the <num> century
in an obituary tribute in the times bernard levin wrote what we have lost with laurence olivier is glory
he reflected it in his greatest roles indeed he walked clad in it — you could practically see it glowing around him like a nimbus
no one will ever play the roles he played as he played them no one will replace the splendour that he gave his native land with his genius
billington commented olivier elevated the art of acting in the twentieth century
principally by the overwhelming force of his example
like garrick kean and irving before him he lent glamour and excitement to acting so that in any theatre in the world an olivier night raised the level of expectation and sent spectators out into the darkness a little more aware of themselves and having experienced a transcendent touch of ecstasy
that in the end was the true measure of his greatness
after olivier 's death gielgud reflected he followed in the theatrical tradition of kean and irving
he respected tradition in the theatre but he also took great delight in breaking tradition which is what made him so unique
he was gifted brilliant and one of the great controversial figures of our time in theatre which is a virtue and not a vice at all
olivier said in <year> that he believed he was born to be an actor but his colleague peter ustinov disagreed he commented that although olivier 's great contemporaries were clearly predestined for the stage larry could have been a notable ambassador a considerable minister a redoubtable cleric
at his worst he would have acted the parts more ably than they are usually lived
the director david ayliff agreed that acting did not come instinctively to olivier as it did to his great rivals
he observed ralph was a natural actor he couldn 't stop being a perfect actor olivier did it through sheer hard work and determination
the american actor william redfield had a similar view ironically enough laurence olivier is less gifted than marlon brando
he is even less gifted than richard burton paul scofield ralph richardson and john gielgud
but he is still the definitive actor of the twentieth century
why because he wanted to be
his achievements are due to dedication scholarship practice determination and courage
he is the bravest actor of our time
in comparing olivier and the other leading actors of his generation ustinov wrote it is of course vain to talk of who is and who is not the greatest actor
there is simply no such thing as a greatest actor or painter or composer
nonetheless some colleagues particularly film actors such as spencer tracy humphrey bogart and lauren bacall came to regard olivier as the finest of his peers
peter hall though acknowledging olivier as the head of the theatrical profession thought richardson the greater actor
others such as the critic michael coveney awarded the palm to gielgud
olivier 's claim to theatrical greatness lay not only in his acting but as in hall 's words the supreme man of the theatre of our time pioneering britain 's national theatre
as bragg identified no one doubts that the national is perhaps his most enduring monument

the ships were ordered for the <year> – <num> naval building program of the german imperial navy as a reply to the royal navy 's three new lion @-@ class battlecruisers that had been launched a few years earlier
the preceding moltke class and the incrementally improved seydlitz represented the end of the evolution of germany 's first generation of battlecruisers
the derfflinger class had considerable improvements including a larger primary armament all of which was mounted on the centerline eliminating the restricted arc of the amidships turret
the ships were also larger than the preceding classes
the derfflinger class used a similar propulsion system and as a result of the increased displacement were slightly slower
the class comprised three ships derfflinger lützow and hindenburg
all three of the ships saw active service with the high seas fleet during world war i
derfflinger was commissioned shortly after the outbreak of war and was present at most of the naval actions in the north sea including the battles of dogger bank and jutland
lützow was commissioned in august <year> and only participated in the raid on yarmouth before being sunk at jutland
hindenburg was commissioned into the fleet in may <year> and saw no major action
derfflinger and hindenburg were interned at scapa flow following the armistice in november <year>
rear admiral ludwig von reuter who was in command of the interned high seas fleet ordered the ships to be scuttled in an attempt to prevent their possible seizure by the royal navy
admiral alfred von tirpitz used public outcry over the british involvement in the agadir crisis of <year> to pressure the reichstag into appropriating additional funds to the navy
the fourth naval law secured funding for three new dreadnoughts two light cruisers and an extra <num> @,@ <num> officers and men in the navy for <year>
the three dreadnoughts secured in the bill became derfflinger lützow and hindenburg
design work on the first two ships began in october <year> and continued until june <year> hindenburg was built to a slightly modified design which was created between may and october <year>
when design work began the navy department was asked to submit new requirements to fix deficiencies found in the preceding battlecruiser classes which primarily covered propulsion systems and the main armament
previous battlecruisers used a four shaft arrangement for their engines reducing the number to three would allow the new ships to equip a diesel engine on the central shaft
this would substantially increase the cruising range and would ease the transfer of fuel and reduce the number of crew needed to operate the ships machinery
the navy department also argued for an increase in the main battery guns from <num> @-@ centimeter <num> in guns to <num>
<num> cm <num> in weapons
this was because the latest british battleships had thicker main belt armor up to <num> millimeters <num> in
since the german battlecruisers were intended to fight in the line of battle their armament needed to be sufficiently powerful to penetrate the armor of their british opponents
weight increases were managed by reducing the number of guns from <num> to <num> — the increase in gun caliber added only <num> tons to the ships displacement
tirpitz argued against the increase in gun caliber for he thought the <num> cm gun was powerful enough
a new construction technique was employed to save weight
previous battlecruisers were built with a combination of transverse and longitudinal steel frames the derfflinger @-@ class ships dispensed with the transverse frames and used only the longitudinal ones
this enabled the ship to retain structural strength and a lower weight
as with all preceding capital ships the outer hull spaces between the hull wall and the torpedo bulkhead were used for coal storage
on <num> september <year> the design board chose the <num>
<num> cm to be mounted in four twin turrets on the centerline of the ship
the armor layout was kept the same as in seydlitz
in the meantime pressure from the british public and media had forced the british parliament to step up ship building
kaiser wilhelm ii requested that the build time for the new battlecruisers be reduced to two years each as opposed to three years
this proved unfeasible because neither the armor or armament firms could supply the necessary materials according to an expedited schedule

the first two ships were designed to displace <num> @,@ <num> tonnes <num> @,@ <num> long tons with a standard load and up to <num> @,@ <num> tonnes <num> @,@ <num> long tons at combat weight
hindenburg displaced slightly more at <num> @,@ <num> tonnes <num> @,@ <num> long tons standard and <num> @,@ <num> tonnes <num> @,@ <num> long tons fully laden
the ships hulls were constructed from longitudinal steel frames over which the outer hull plates were riveted
derfflinger 's hull contained <num> watertight compartments though lützow and hindenburg had an additional seventeenth compartment
all three ships had a double bottom that ran for <num> of the length of the hull
this was a decrease from preceding german battlecruisers which had a double bottom for at least <num> of the hull
the ships were regarded as excellent sea boats by the german navy
the derfflinger @-@ class ships were described as having had gentle motion though they were wet at the casemate deck
the ships lost up to <num> speed with the twin rudders hard over and heeled up to <num> degrees
this was greater than any of the preceding battlecruiser designs and as a result anti @-@ roll tanks were fitted to derfflinger
the three ships had a metacentric height of <num>
<num> m <num> ft <num> in
the standard crew for one of the vessels was <num> officers and <num> @,@ <num> men when serving as the flagship for the i scouting group the ships carried an additional <num> officers and <num> men
the derfflingers carried smaller craft including one picket boat three barges two launches two yawls and two dinghies
instead the plan to use a three @-@ shaft system was abandoned and the ships reverted to the standard four @-@ shaft arrangement
each of the three ships were equipped with two sets of marine @-@ type turbines each set drove a pair of <num> @-@ bladed screws that were <num>
<num> m <num> ft <num> in in diameter on derfflinger and lützow and <num> m <num> ft <num> in in diameter on hindenburg
each set consisted of a high- and low @-@ pressure turbine — the high @-@ pressure machines drove the outer shafts while the low @-@ pressure turbines turned the inner pair
steam was supplied to the turbines from <num> coal @-@ fired marine @-@ type double boilers and eight oil @-@ fired marine @-@ type double @-@ ended boilers
each ship was equipped with a pair of turbo @-@ electric generators and a pair of diesel @-@ electric generators that provided a total of <num> @,@ <num> kilowatts at <num> volts
each ship was equipped with two rudders
the engines for first two ships were designed to provide <num> @,@ <num> shaft horsepower <num> @,@ <num> kw at <num> revolutions per minute
this would have given the two ships a top speed of <num>
<num> knots <num>

the propellant magazines were located underneath the shell rooms for the two forward turrets as well as the rear superfiring turret the arrangement was reversed for the rearmost turret
the ships were designed to carry fourteen <num> cm <num>
<num> in sk l <num> guns mounted in casemates along the superstructure
because derfflinger had to be fitted with anti @-@ roll tanks two of the casemated guns had to be removed to allow enough room in the hull
lützow and hindenburg were equipped with the designed number of guns
each gun was supplied with <num> rounds and had a maximum range of <num> @,@ <num> m <num> @,@ <num> yd though this was later extended to <num> @,@ <num> m <num> @,@ <num> yd

during the engagement derfflinger had both of her rear turrets knocked out by british gunfire
her crew suffered <num> men killed and <num> wounded which was the highest casualty figure for any german ship not sunk
the resilience of the vessel earned her the nickname iron dog from her british adversaries
repair work lasted until <num> october during which the ship had her pole mast removed and replaced with a tripod mast
the ship conducted training operations until november at which point she returned to active duty with the fleet
following the german capitulation in november <year> derfflinger was interned with a significant portion of the high seas fleet in scapa flow
on <num> june <year> with the guard ships of the royal navy out on maneuvers rear admiral ludwig von reuter ordered that the fleet be scuttled

while en route to the target vice admiral franz von hipper 's flagship seydlitz was heavily damaged by mines
as a result lützow was transferred to the role of squadron flagship
during the operation the german battlecruisers encountered british light forces and a running battle ensued
lützow engaged the light cruiser hms conquest and hit her several times
at the battle of jutland she was the first ship in the german line and hipper 's flagship and drew fire from the british battlecruisers which included hits below her waterline
shortly after the start of the battlecruiser action lützow hit her opponent lion several times one hit knocked out lion 's q turret and the resulting magazine fire nearly destroyed the ship
shortly after <num> <num> the armored cruisers defence and warrior inadvertently ran into the german line lützow opened fire immediately followed by several german dreadnoughts
in a hail of shells defence 's ammunition magazines detonated and the ship was sunk
at around the same time the fresh battlecruisers of the <num> battlecruiser squadron engaged their german opposites
between <num> <num> and <num> <num> lützow sustained four <num> @-@ inch shell hits in her bow from the british battlecruisers these eventually proved to be fatal
despite this at <num> <num> the combined fire of lützow and her sister derfflinger destroyed the battlecruiser invincible
by <num> <num> lützow had been hit five more times including hits on her two forward turrets
by <num> <num> lützow had shipped nearly <num> @,@ <num> tons of water and the ship was dangerously down by the bows
after midnight attempts were made to steer the ship in reverse
this failed when the bow became submerged enough to bring the stern out of the water by <num> <num> the screws and both rudders were coming out of the water and the ship was no longer able to steer
the order to abandon ship was given and at <num> <num> lützow was sunk by the torpedo boat g38
the ship was lost because the flooding in the bow could not be controlled the forward pump system failed and the central system could not keep up with the rising water
the crew was picked up by four torpedo boats that had been escorting the crippled battlecruiser during the battle the ship suffered <num> men killed
she was commissioned <num> may <year> and was fully operational by <num> october <year> too late to see any major action in world war i
on <num> november hindenburg and moltke along with the light cruisers of the ii scouting group were acting as distant support for german minesweepers off the german coast when they were attacked by british battlecruisers
the raid was brief by the time hindenburg and moltke arrived on the scene the british ships had broken off the attack and withdrawn
six days later hindenburg replaced seydlitz as flagship of the i scouting group
on <num> april <year> the ship took part in an abortive fleet advance into the north sea that attempted to intercept an allied convoy
moltke sustained mechanical damage while en route and as a result vice admiral hipper decided to cancel the operation
on <num> august hipper was promoted to admiral and given command of the entire high seas fleet
rear admiral ludwig von reuter replaced hipper as the commander of the i scouting group he raised his flag on hindenburg the following day
hindenburg was interned at scapa flow along with her sister derfflinger and the rest of the german battlecruisers
she was scuttled on <num> june <year> and sank at <num> <num>
several unsuccessful attempts to raise her were made on <num> july <year> the ship was finally raised
from <year> to <year> she was scrapped at rosyth
her bell was presented to the german federal navy on <num> may <year>
the o 'brien class was the third of five classes of destroyers that were known as the thousand tonners because they were the first u
s
destroyers over <num> @,@ <num> long tons <num> @,@ <num> t displacement
the design of what became the o 'brien class was the result of discussions between the general board of the united states navy and the u
s
navy 's bureau of ordnance
what resulted was a design that was an incremental development of the aylwin class which itself was similar to the first of the thousand tonners the cassin class which displaced about a third more than the preceding paulding class
the key difference in the o 'brien class was the increase in torpedo size going up to <num> inches <num> mm from the preceding classes <num> @-@ inch <num> mm torpedoes
the ships had a median displacement of <num> @,@ <num> long tons <num> @,@ <num> t were just over <num> feet <num> m in length and had a beam of about <num> feet <num>
<num> m
all of the ships had two direct @-@ drive steam turbines and a combination of other engines for cruising at speeds less than <num> knots <num> km h
all of the ships were designed for a maximum speed of <num> knots <num> km h
as built they were armed with four <num> @-@ inch <num> mm guns and had four twin <num> @-@ inch torpedo tubes with a load of eight torpedoes but all were later equipped with depth charges
the ships were built by four private american shipyards — bath iron works fore river shipbuilding company new york shipbuilding corporation and william cramp and sons — and were laid down between september and november <year> launched between april <year> and february <year> and commissioned into the u
s
navy between june <year> and august <year>
all six ships operated in the atlantic or caribbean until the u
s
entrance into world war i in april <year> when all six were sent overseas to queenstown ireland for convoy escort duties
several of the ships rescued passengers and crew from ships sunk by u @-@ boats and several had encounters with u @-@ boats themselves nicholson helped sink u @-@ <num> in november <year> the first u @-@ boat sunk by the u
s
navy
all six members of the class had returned to the united states in january <year> and were decommissioned by june <year>
in <year> two of the six — ericsson and mcdougal — were commissioned into the united states coast guard to help enforce prohibition as a part of the rum patrol
they were returned to u
s
navy custody in <year> and <year> respectively
all six ships had been sold for scrapping by june <year>
the design for destroyers no
<num> through no
<num> — what became the o 'brien class was to closely follow the design of the cassin and aylwin classes from fiscal year <year>
the chief of the u
s
navy 's bureau of ordnance buord suggested that the new destroyers be equipped with ten torpedo tubes and urged that the new <num> @-@ inch <num> mm torpedo be adopted
the general board agreed in principle adopting the <num> @-@ inch torpedo tubes but eliminated buord 's proposed centerline torpedo tubes and keeping the number of tubes at eight the same as the cassin and aylwin classes
the additional weight of the larger torpedoes <num> long tons <num>
<num> t of top weight was offset by reducing the planned two aft @-@ facing guns to a single one
this gave the class four <num> @-@ inch <num> mm guns which again matched the battery of the cassin and aylwin classes
the design for the o 'brien class was approved on <num> august <year> and authorized by congress on <num> march <year>
<num> m in length overall were <num> feet <num> inches <num>
<num> m abeam and had a standard draft of <num> feet <num> inches <num>
<num> m
the hull shape featured the distinctive high forecastle typical of u

the ships were equipped with two propeller shafts and two direct @-@ drive zoelly steam turbines fed by four white @-@ forster boilers
the power plant of the ships generated <num> @,@ <num> shaft horsepower <num> @,@ <num> kw which drive the ships to the design speed of <num> knots <num> km h
because of inherent inefficiency of turbines at low speeds all of the ships were equipped with supplemental cruising engines for travel at speeds under <num> knots <num> km h
all except cushing were equipped with supplemental triple @-@ expansion reciprocating engines o 'brien nicholson and winslow each had a pair of reciprocating engines for cruising mcdougal and ericsson were outfitted with only one
instead of reciprocating engines cushing was equipped with a pair of geared steam turbines for cruising
the main battery of the o 'brien class consisted of four <num> @-@ inch <num> mm <num> mark <num> guns with each gun weighing in excess of <num> @,@ <num> pounds <num> @,@ <num> kg
the guns fired <num> @-@ pound <num> kg armor @-@ piercing projectiles at <num> @,@ <num> feet per second <num> m s
at an elevation of <num> ° the guns had a range of <num> @,@ <num> yards <num> @,@ <num> m
the o 'brien ships were also equipped with four twin <num> @-@ inch <num> mm torpedo tubes for a total load of eight mark <num> torpedoes
although the general board had called for two anti @-@ aircraft guns for the o 'brien class they were not originally outfitted with the weapons the later sampson class was the first american destroyer class so armed
likewise there is no record of any of the o 'brien ships being outfitted with mine @-@ laying apparatus
during world war i most american destroyers were used in anti @-@ submarine warfare roles and were equipped with depth charges and delivery systems such as y @-@ guns and depth charge racks
o 'brien @-@ class ships were equipped with depth charges during the war but no specific mentions of the types of depth charges used or delivery system are recorded in secondary sources
s

the cassin class the first of the thousand tonners displaced about a third more than the preceding paulding class
the introduction of the thousand tonners led to the pauldings and other older smaller displacement destroyers of previous classes to be dismissively called flivvers a nickname also commonly applied to the ford model t
the o 'brien class was the third of the five classes of thousand tonners
the earlier cassin- dd @-@ <num> to dd @-@ <num> and aylwin @-@ class dd @-@ <num> to dd @-@ <num> ships were about the same length as the o 'brien ships and all had median displacements in the range of <num> @,@ <num> – <num> @,@ <num> long tons <num> @,@ <num> – <num> @,@ <num> t the later tucker- dd @-@ <num> to dd @-@ <num> and sampson @-@ class dd @-@ <num> to dd @-@ <num> ships were about <num> feet <num>

the story and script were both created by deborah dean davis and hannah louise shearer and the episode was directed by robert becker
set in the <num> century the series follows the adventures of the crew of the starfleet starship enterprise @-@ d
in this episode the crew respond to a distress call from dr
paul manheim rod loomis
while the crew must deal with the results of manheim 's haywire experiments with time captain picard patrick stewart must deal with his former love jenice michelle phillips who is also manheim 's wife
the story of the episode was influenced by the film casablanca and was affected by the timing of the <year> writers guild of america strike
because of the strike the script was written in five days and it was only when it was filmed that it was discovered to be incomplete
shearer was not happy with the result and felt that the on @-@ screen chemistry of stewart and phillips was lacking
reviews of the episode have been mixed with one reviewer summing it up by saying there ’ s nothing i can point to at this episode and say is wrong but it ’ s one of the more forgettable episodes
paul manheim in a nearby system
commander riker jonathan frakes recalls that manheim was ejected from the federation science institute for conducting unauthorized experiments
they find the distress signal coming from a facility on a planetoid surrounded by a force @-@ field
when they make contact with the facility a woman requests help to save her husband dr
manheim and lowers the shields
the two are brought aboard and while dr
crusher gates mcfadden tends to dr
manheim who is having convulsions picard discovers his wife is jenice picard 's former love from before he decided to join starfleet
jenice warns that her husband was working privately in his laboratory but that she didn 't know what he was working on
she also alerts the crew to numerous security protocols that he has installed at the facilities
as the crew prepares to send an away @-@ team to investigate the laboratory they experience more time distortions described by data brent spiner as manheim effects
in one instance picard riker and data enter a turbolift only to see their past selves conversing outside of the lift
the crew find that they cannot complete a transporter beam to the facility due to the instabilities
dr
manheim recovers long enough to explain that he was doing experiments involving time gravity and funnels to other universes and suspects his last experiment is running out @-@ of @-@ hand
manheim explains that he is trapped between two dimensions and data determines that the experiment must be shut down during a time fluctuation or else it will simply grow larger
manheim provides the crew with the correct coordinates to beam down to avoid the security fields
picard admits to jenice that he worried about losing her again after he left her in paris and vows to correct dr
manheim 's experiment
as he is affected less by the distortions data is sent down alone and disables the remaining security measures before entering manheim 's laboratory
he finds a column of energy emanating from a dimensional matrix the source of the time distortions
data though briefly affected by the time distortions is able to add anti @-@ matter to the matrix causing the matrix to stabilize and halt the time distortions
dr
manheim fully recovers and he and jenice thank picard and the crew for their help
picard and jenice use the holodeck to recreate one more encounter at a paris café before she returns with her husband to the planet
as well as the title of the episode and the love triangle in the story the blue parrot café from the film is directly mentioned by captain picard
casablanca was also the basis for the earlier star trek the original series novel the entropy effect and would be so again in the deep space nine episode profit and loss
the story was originally pitched by hannah louise shearer and deborah dean davis who were also given the job of developing the script
the writing of the episode suffered from the timing of the <year> writers guild of america strike with shearer and dean davis completing the script in five days
the premise of the story was a combination of their idea of a story about a professor whose work wasn 't appreciated and had to go off on his own and that of maurice hurley who wanted a story with a time anomaly
the final draft was dated <num> february and featured numerous differences from the filmed version including jenice being called laura a number of different interactions for the crew and riker worf and data all being involved in shutting down manheim 's equipment
the script was finalised a week before the episode was filmed but the writers strike caused further issues when it was discovered during filming that the scene where data was to fix the time distortions hadn 't been completed
robert legato and rick berman spent forty minutes on the telephone with shearer during the strike
while she refused to write the lines during the strike berman suggested dialogue and shearer would give opinions with legato taking down handwritten notes
legato decided on the directing notes himself and used a whip pan shot instead of an effects shot to film the three datas as director robert becker had never used effects shots previously
shearer wasn 't happy with the final result saying we were writing the most romantic episode in the world but that it was toned down <num>
shearer later complained of a lack of chemistry between michelle phillips and patrick stewart which phillips blamed on the conflicted nature of the character in that she was committed to her husband but also wanted to see picard once more
phillips a star trek fan is better known for being a member of the <num> group the mamas the papas
rod loomis previous science fiction outing was in bill and ted 's excellent adventure as sigmund freud and lance spellerberg would later return in the icarus factor where his transporter chief gained the name ensign herbert
the image of <num> century paris was a matte painting which was re @-@ used in star trek vi the undiscovered country where it was hung outside the office of the federation president
it received nielsen ratings of <num>
<num> reflecting the percentage of all households watching the episode during its timeslot
this was the same ratings received as the previous episode skin of evil
several reviewers re @-@ watched the episode after the end of the series
michelle erica green reviewed the episode on behalf of treknation in september <year> comparing certain elements of the episode to casablanca and the series finale all good things

these included the ending where time distortions caused data to be replicated three time in we 'll always have paris compared to the similar situation with three picards in all good things

overall she thought that the episode was better than she recalled previously
jamahl epsicokhan at his website jammer 's reviews described the episode as too simple especially the ending which he said was they give data a canister which he sticks into a hall of mirrors problem solved

club in may <year> said that he enjoyed the time blips in the episode but that he wasn 't a fan of the romance between jenice and picard
he also felt that there wasn 't much follow up on manheim 's experiments and that he seemed to be left to cause a more serious accident in the future
keith decandido watched the episode for tor
com in july <year>
he thought that michele phillips was incredibly radiant and said there ’ s nothing i can point to at this episode and say is wrong but it ’ s one of the more forgettable episodes giving it a score of four out of ten
the episode was later included on the star trek the next generation season one dvd box set released in march <year> and was released as part of the season one blu @-@ ray set on july <num> <year>
most burns are due to heat from hot liquids solids or fire
among women in many areas of the world the risk is related to the use of open cooking fires or unsafe cook stoves
alcoholism and smoking are other risk factors
burns can also occur as a result of self harm or violence between people
burns that affect only the superficial skin layers are known as superficial or first @-@ degree burns
they appear red without blisters and pain typically lasts around three days
when the injury extends into some of the underlying skin layer it is a partial @-@ thickness or second @-@ degree burn
blisters are frequently present and they are often very painful
healing can require up to eight weeks and scarring may occur
in a full @-@ thickness or third @-@ degree burn the injury extends to all layers of the skin
often there is no pain and the burn area is stiff
healing typically does not occur on its own
a fourth @-@ degree burn additionally involves injury to deeper tissues such as muscle tendons or bone
the burn is often black and frequently leads to loss of the burned part
burns are generally preventable
treatment depends on the severity of the burn
superficial burns may be managed with little more than simple pain medication while major burns may require prolonged treatment in specialized burn centers
cooling with tap water may help pain and decrease damage however prolonged cooling may result in low body temperature
partial @-@ thickness burns may require cleaning with soap and water followed by dressings
it is not clear how to manage blisters but it is probably reasonable to leave them intact if small and drain them if large
full @-@ thickness burns usually require surgical treatments such as skin grafting
extensive burns often require large amounts of intravenous fluid due to capillary fluid leakage and tissue swelling
the most common complications of burns involve infection
tetanus toxoid should be given if not up to date
in <year> fire and heat resulted in <num> million injuries
this resulted in about <num>
<num> million hospitalizations and <num> @,@ <num> dying
most deaths due to burns occur in the developing world particularly in southeast asia
while large burns can be fatal treatments developed since <year> have improved outcomes especially in children and young adults
in the united states approximately <num> of those admitted to a burn center survive their injuries
burns occur at similar frequencies in men and women
the long @-@ term outcome is related to the size of burn and the age of the person affected
superficial burns cause pain lasting two or three days followed by peeling of the skin over the next few days
individuals suffering from more severe burns may indicate discomfort or complain of feeling pressure rather than pain
full @-@ thickness burns may be entirely insensitive to light touch or puncture
while superficial burns are typically red in color severe burns may be pink white or black
burns around the mouth or singed hair inside the nose may indicate that burns to the airways have occurred but these findings are not definitive
more worrisome signs include shortness of breath hoarseness and stridor or wheezing
itchiness is common during the healing process occurring in up to <num> of adults and nearly all children
numbness or tingling may persist for a prolonged period of time after an electrical injury
burns may also produce emotional and psychological distress
in the united states the most common causes of burns are fire or flame <num> scalds <num> hot objects <num> electricity <num> and chemicals <num>
most <num> burn injuries occur at home or at work <num> and most are accidental with <num> due to assault by another and <num> @-@ <num> resulting from a suicide attempt
these sources can cause inhalation injury to the airway and or lungs occurring in about <num>
burn injuries occur more commonly among the poor
smoking is a risk factor although alcohol use is not
fire @-@ related burns are generally more common in colder climates
specific risk factors in the developing world include cooking with open fires or on the floor as well as developmental disabilities in children and chronic diseases in adults
of house fires that result in death smoking causes <num> and heating devices cause <num>
almost half of injuries are due to efforts to fight a fire
scalding is caused by hot liquids or gases and most commonly occurs from exposure to hot drinks high temperature tap water in baths or showers hot cooking oil or steam
scald injuries are most common in children under the age of five and in the united states and australia this population makes up about two @-@ thirds of all burns
contact with hot objects is the cause of about <num> @-@ <num> of burns in children
generally scalds are first- or second @-@ degree burns but third @-@ degree burns may also result especially with prolonged contact
fireworks are a common cause of burns during holiday seasons in many countries
this is a particular risk for adolescent males
chemical burns can be caused by over <num> @,@ <num> substances most of which are either a strong base <num> or a strong acid <num>
most chemical burn deaths are secondary to ingestion
common agents include sulfuric acid as found in toilet cleaners sodium hypochlorite as found in bleach and halogenated hydrocarbons as found in paint remover among others
hydrofluoric acid can cause particularly deep burns that may not become symptomatic until some time after exposure
formic acid may cause the breakdown of significant numbers of red blood cells
the most common causes of electrical burns in children are electrical cords <num> followed by electrical outlets <num>
lightning may also result in electrical burns
risk factors for being struck include involvement in outdoor activities such as mountain climbing golf and field sports and working outside
mortality from a lightning strike is about <num>
while electrical injuries primarily result in burns they may also cause fractures or dislocations secondary to blunt force trauma or muscle contractions
in high voltage injuries most damage may occur internally and thus the extent of the injury cannot be judged by examination of the skin alone
contact with either low voltage or high voltage may produce cardiac arrhythmias or cardiac arrest
sun exposure is the most common cause of radiation burns and the most common cause of superficial burns overall
there is significant variation in how easily people sunburn based on their skin type
skin effects from ionizing radiation depend on the amount of exposure to the area with hair loss seen after <num> gy redness seen after <num> gy wet skin peeling after <num> gy and necrosis after <num> gy
redness if it occurs may not appear until some time after exposure
radiation burns are treated the same as other burns
microwave burns occur via thermal heating caused by the microwaves
while exposures as short as two seconds may cause injury overall this is an uncommon occurrence
reasons include child abuse personal disputes spousal abuse elder abuse and business disputes
an immersion injury or immersion scald may indicate child abuse
it is created when an extremity or the lower body buttock or perineum is held under the surface of hot water
it typically produces a sharp upper border and is often symmetrical
other high @-@ risk signs of potential abuse include circumferential burns the absence of splash marks a burn of uniform depth and association with other signs of neglect or abuse
bride burning a form of domestic violence occurs in some cultures such as india where women have been burned in revenge for what the husband or his family consider an inadequate dowry
in pakistan acid burns represent <num> of intentional burns and are frequently related to domestic violence
self @-@ immolation setting oneself on fire is also used as a form of protest in various parts of the world
this results in cell and tissue damage
many of the direct health effects of a burn are secondary to disruption in the normal functioning of the skin
they include disruption of the skin 's sensation ability to prevent water loss through evaporation and ability to control body temperature
disruption of cell membranes causes cells to lose potassium to the spaces outside the cell and to take up water and sodium
in large burns over <num> of the total body surface area there is a significant inflammatory response
this results in increased leakage of fluid from the capillaries and subsequent tissue edema
this causes overall blood volume loss with the remaining blood suffering significant plasma loss making the blood more concentrated
poor blood flow to organs such as the kidneys and gastrointestinal tract may result in renal failure and stomach ulcers
increased levels of catecholamines and cortisol can cause a hypermetabolic state that can last for years
this is associated with increased cardiac output metabolism a fast heart rate and poor immune function
the most commonly used classification is based on the depth of injury
the depth of a burn is usually determined via examination although a biopsy may also be used
it may be difficult to accurately determine the depth of a burn on a single examination and repeated examinations over a few days may be necessary
in those who have a headache or are dizzy and have a fire @-@ related burn carbon monoxide poisoning should be considered
cyanide poisoning should also be considered
first @-@ degree burns that are only red in color and are not blistering are not included in this estimation
most burns <num> involve less than <num> of the tbsa
there are a number of methods to determine the tbsa including the wallace rule of nines lund and browder chart and estimations based on a person 's palm size
the rule of nines is easy to remember but only accurate in people over <num> years of age
more accurate estimates can be made using lund and browder charts which take into account the different proportions of body parts in adults and children
the size of a person 's handprint including the palm and fingers is approximately <num> of their tbsa
under this system burns can be classified as major moderate and minor
this is assessed based on a number of factors including total body surface area affected the involvement of specific anatomical zones the age of the person and associated injuries
minor burns can typically be managed at home moderate burns are often managed in hospital and major burns are managed by a burn center
burn prevention programs have significantly decreased rates of serious burns
preventive measures include limiting hot water temperatures smoke alarms sprinkler systems proper construction of buildings and fire @-@ resistant clothing
experts recommend setting water heaters below <num>
<num> ° c <num>
<num> ° f
other measures to prevent scalds include using a thermometer to measure bath water temperatures and splash guards on stoves
while the effect of the regulation of fireworks is unclear there is tentative evidence of benefit with recommendations including the limitation of the sale of fireworks to children
if inhalation injury is suspected early intubation may be required
this is followed by care of the burn wound itself
people with extensive burns may be wrapped in clean sheets until they arrive at a hospital
as burn wounds are prone to infection a tetanus booster shot should be given if an individual has not been immunized within the last five years

with major burns early feeding is important
hyperbaric oxygenation may be useful in addition to traditional treatments
in children with more than <num> @-@ <num> tbsa burns and adults with more than <num> tbsa burns formal fluid resuscitation and monitoring should follow
this should be begun pre @-@ hospital if possible in those with burns greater than <num> tbsa
the parkland formula can help determine the volume of intravenous fluids required over the first <num> hours
the formula is based on the affected individual 's tbsa and weight
half of the fluid is administered over the first <num> hours and the remainder over the following <num> hours
the time is calculated from when the burn occurred and not from the time that fluid resuscitation began
children require additional maintenance fluid that includes glucose
additionally those with inhalation injuries require more fluid
while inadequate fluid resuscitation may cause problems over @-@ resuscitation can also be detrimental
the formulas are only a guide with infusions ideally tailored to a urinary output of <num> ml h in adults or 1ml kg in children and mean arterial pressure greater than <num> mmhg
while lactated ringer 's solution is often used there is no evidence that it is superior to normal saline
crystalloid fluids appear just as good as colloid fluids and as colloids are more expensive they are not recommended
blood transfusions are rarely required
they are typically only recommended when the hemoglobin level falls below <num> @-@ <num> g l <num> @-@ <num> g dl due to the associated risk of complications
intravenous catheters may be placed through burned skin if needed or intraosseous infusions may be used
it should be performed with cool water <num> – <num> ° c <num>
<num> – <num>
<num> ° f and not ice water as the latter can cause further injury
chemical burns may require extensive irrigation
cleaning with soap and water removal of dead tissue and application of dressings are important aspects of wound care
if intact blisters are present it is not clear what should be done with them
some tentative evidence supports leaving them intact
second @-@ degree burns should be re @-@ evaluated after two days
in the management of first and second @-@ degree burns little quality evidence exists to determine which dressing type to use
it is reasonable to manage first @-@ degree burns without dressings
while topical antibiotics are often recommended there is little evidence to support their use
silver sulfadiazine a type of antibiotic is not recommended as it potentially prolongs healing time
there is insufficient evidence to support the use of dressings containing silver or negative @-@ pressure wound therapy
these include simple analgesics such as ibuprofen and acetaminophen and opioids such as morphine
benzodiazepines may be used in addition to analgesics to help with anxiety
during the healing process antihistamines massage or transcutaneous nerve stimulation may be used to aid with itching
antihistamines however are only effective for this purpose in <num> of people
there is tentative evidence supporting the use of gabapentin and its use may be reasonable in those who do not improve with antihistamines
intravenous lidocaine requires more study before it can be recommended for pain
intravenous antibiotics are recommended before surgery for those with extensive burns <num> tbsa
as of <year> guidelines do not recommend their general use due to concerns regarding antibiotic resistance and the increased risk of fungal infections
tentative evidence however shows that they may improve survival rates in those with large and severe burns
erythropoietin has not been found effective to prevent or treat anemia in burn cases
in burns caused by hydrofluoric acid calcium gluconate is a specific antidote and may be used intravenously and or topically
recombinant human growth hormone rhgh in those with burns that involve more than <num> of their body appears to speed healing without affecting the risk of death
circumferential burns of the limbs or chest may need urgent surgical release of the skin known as an escharotomy
this is done to treat or prevent problems with distal circulation or ventilation
it is uncertain if it is useful for neck or digit burns
fasciotomies may be required for electrical burns
there is tentative evidence that honey helps heal partial thickness burns
the evidence for aloe vera is of poor quality
while it might be beneficial in reducing pain and a review from <year> found tentative evidence of improved healing times a subsequent review from <year> did not find improved healing over silver sulfadiazine
there were only three randomized controlled trials for the use of plants for burns two for aloe vera and one for oatmeal
there is little evidence that vitamin e helps with keloids or scarring
butter is not recommended
in low income countries burns are treated up to one @-@ third of the time with traditional medicine which may include applications of eggs mud leaves or cow dung
surgical management is limited in some cases due to insufficient financial resources and availability
there are a number of other methods that may be used in addition to medications to reduce procedural pain and anxiety including virtual reality therapy hypnosis and behavioral approaches such as distraction techniques
the presence of a smoke inhalation injury other significant injuries such as long bone fractures and serious co @-@ morbidities e
g
heart disease diabetes psychiatric illness and suicidal intent also influence prognosis
on average of those admitted to united states burn centers <num> die with the outcome for individuals dependent on the extent of the burn injury
for example admittees with burn areas less than <num> tbsa had a mortality rate of less than <num> while admittees with over <num> tbsa had a mortality rate of <num>
in afghanistan people with more than <num> tbsa burns rarely survive
the baux score has historically been used to determine prognosis of major burns
however with improved care it is no longer very accurate
the score is determined by adding the size of the burn tbsa to the age of the person and taking that to be more or less equal to the risk of death
burns in <year> resulted in <num>
<num> million years lived with disability and <num>
<num> million disability adjusted life years

keloids may form subsequent to a burn particularly in those who are young and dark skinned
following a burn children may have significant psychological trauma and experience post @-@ traumatic stress disorder
scarring may also result in a disturbance in body image
in the developing world significant burns may result in social isolation extreme poverty and child abandonment

<num> per <num> @,@ <num>
the number of fatal burns has increased from <num> @,@ <num> in <year> to <num> @,@ <num> in <year>
in the developed world adult males have twice the mortality as females from burns
this is most probably due to their higher risk occupations and greater risk @-@ taking activities
in many countries in the developing world however females have twice the risk of males
this is often related to accidents in the kitchen or domestic violence
in children deaths from burns occur at more than ten times the rate in the developing than the developed world
overall in children it is one of the top fifteen leading causes of death
from the <num> to <year> many countries have seen both a decrease in the rates of fatal burns and in burns generally
they resulted in about <num> @,@ <num> deaths in <year>
most burns <num> and deaths from burns occur in males
the highest incidence of fire burns occurs in those <num> – <num> years old while the highest incidence of scalds occurs in children less than five years old and adults over <num>
electrical burns result in about <num> @,@ <num> deaths per year
lightning results in the death of about <num> people a year
in europe intentional burns occur most commonly in middle aged men
the highest rates occur in women <num> – <num> years of age
part of this high rate is related to unsafe kitchens and loose @-@ fitting clothing typical to india
it is estimated that one @-@ third of all burns in india are due to clothing catching fire from open flames
intentional burns are also a common cause and occur at high rates in young women secondary to domestic violence and self @-@ harm
the earliest egyptian records on treating burns describes dressings prepared with milk from mothers of baby boys and the <year> bce edwin smith papyrus describes treatments using honey and the salve of resin

east coast ultimately peaking as a moderate storm with winds of <num> mph <num> km h before crossing the mid @-@ atlantic states and new england it dissipated on july <num> over southern canada
the storm inflicted moderate damage in florida the worst since hurricane easy of <year> and dropped heavy rainfall as far north as new york city
total damage is estimated at us <num> million and only indirect deaths are blamed on the cyclone
early in its life the system had a broad circulation with primarily light winds similar to that of a subtropical storm
the storm is estimated to have become a tropical depression earlier the previous day as it moved toward the northeast
it made landfall along the florida coast near cross city and continued inland gradually accelerating
it likely attained tropical storm status at around <num> utc on july <num> while its center was situated west of tampa
the cyclone was named brenda after reconnaissance aircraft confirmed that it had reached tropical storm strength
brenda tracked northward hugging the georgia and south carolina coasts before moving inland over north carolina
it attained its peak winds of <num> mph <num> km h in the late evening of july <num> while situated south of wilmington
several hours later the storm emerged over the chesapeake bay moving northeast at about <num> mph <num> km h
brenda crossed the delmarva peninsula and rapidly tracked into southern new jersey
the storm crossed the state and eventually made another landfall on long island before making yet another landfall in coastal connecticut
at around <num> utc on july <num> brenda moved into massachusetts
shortly thereafter it lost its tropical characteristics and transitioned into an extratropical cyclone
it dissipated by august <num> over southern canada
because brenda was in the vicinity of land for most of its course it was not able to intensify beyond tropical storm status
rainfall from tropical storm brenda affected at least <num> states
the heaviest precipitation fell in western florida near tampa east of the storm 's center the tampa international airport recorded <num>
<num> in <num> mm of rainfall
extensive flooding occurred in the west @-@ central florida peninsula
wind gusts exceeded <num> mph <num> km h and the storm produced <num> ft <num>

around the naples area brenda 's effects were primarily light although small boat and dock facilities and roads sustained some damage
a private seawall at clearwater was breached in two places by the cyclone
brenda was considered the worst storm to strike the area since hurricane easy in <year>
while no casualties are directly blamed on the storm at least one traffic @-@ related death took place
according to an american red cross disaster service report encompassing eight florida counties <num> houses sustained significant damage while <num> suffered more minor damage
around <num> families were affected overall

he retained his rank of colonel in the part @-@ time forces in an honorary capacity
on arrival in fremantle six companies of the <num> battalion were embarked on the transport and weir was appointed officer commanding troops for the voyage
the troops began disembarking at alexandria on <num> december <year> and were entrained for cairo where they began to set up camp at mena
the australian official war historian charles bean described weir as being somewhat above average in years for a battalion commander
following the allied decision to land a force on the gallipoli peninsula the <num> brigade was selected as the covering force for the landing at anzac cove
the <num> battalion embarked for the greek island of lemnos in the northern aegean sea on <num> march <year> and after further training on lemnos the battalion was one of the first two battalions ashore on the morning of <num> april <year>
during the landing when the boats carrying the lead elements of the battalion were around <num> yards <num> m from shore according to bean weir observed to another officer in his boat that everything was silent but soon after ottoman troops began firing at the landing force
weir landed with the scout platoon and urged both his men and those of the <num> battalion to immediately begin climbing the cliffs that overlooked the beach
weir along with b and c companies of the battalion reached what later became known as plugge 's plateau
heavy fighting followed the initial landing and within five days half of weir 's battalion had been killed or wounded
the australian and new zealand advance inland from anzac cove was subsequently checked by the defending ottoman forces and was eventually contained in a small beachhead inside a series of ridges that ranged around the cove
weir was the only commanding officer from the <num> brigade to go forward of the first ridge and a ridge running off the <num> plateau subsequently became known as weir ridge

exhausted on <num> september <year> he asked to be relieved and his request was granted
he returned to australia on <num> september <year> and his aif appointment was terminated on <num> december
in the australian official history of the war bean observed that despite his age weir took his battalion into the front line commanded it there throughout its first battle and remained longer in the field than almost any of the senior militia officers who had left with the original force
in <year> he was awarded the distinguished service order and the russian empire order of st

weir retired from the cmf as an honorary brigadier general in march <year> his last appointment being as commander of the <num> infantry brigade
he was only the second south australia @-@ born officer to reach the rank of brigadier general
on <num> march <year> weir was appointed honorary colonel of the <num> battalion a position he held for many years
firstly he was repatriated well before most servicemen and secondly south australia had implemented a policy of preferment of returned servicemen for government employment
these circumstances helped him gain appointment as the first south australian public service commissioner in <year>
weir was not suited to this role being unable to navigate the competing personal and political agendas of senior public servants and politicians and was soon sidelined
in <year> legislative changes made it possible for the government to replace weir and this took place in <year>

independent studio media rights capital purchased the rights to house of cards with the intent on creating a series
netflix agreed to contribute an undisclosed fixed fee to production costs in march <year>
as he was completing his work on the curious case of benjamin button fincher was introduced to the original miniseries by his agent and sought to develop a series with eric roth
house of cards was pitched to several cable networks including hbo amc and showtime
netflix interested in launching their own original programming outbid the networks picking the series up for <num> episodes totaling two seasons
netflix was the only bidder that was interested in purchasing the rights without seeing a completed pilot
thus the show was not forced into manipulating story arcs introduced in the pilot to create artificial cliffhangers
in the first read through he said i want everybody here to know that you represent our first choice — each actor here represents our first choice for these characters
so do not fuck this up
spacey whose last regular television role was in the series wiseguy responded positively to the script
he then played richard iii which fincher said was great training
spacey supported the decision to release all of the episodes at once believing that this type of release pattern will be increasingly common with television shows
he said when i ask my friends what they did with their weekend they say oh i stayed in and watched three seasons of breaking bad or it 's two seasons of game of thrones
he was officially cast on march <num> <year>
robin wright was approached by fincher to star in the series when they worked together in the girl with the dragon tattoo
she was cast as claire underwood in june <year>
kate mara was cast as zoe barnes in early february <year>
mara 's sister rooney mara worked with fincher in the girl with the dragon tattoo and when kate mara read the part of zoe she fell in love with the character and asked her sister to put in a word for me with fincher
the next month she got a call for an audition
filming for the first season began in january <year> in harford county maryland
chapter <num> sets the tone for the environs of the series
according to david carr the political environs have such marbleness that it belies the clandestine nature of political activities including those of underwood who says he is there to clear the pipes and keep the sludge moving
the fictional newspaper the washington herald is set with brutal lighting and drab furniture in part because it was filmed at the real life baltimore sun offices
carr uses several pejorative adjectives to describe barnes apartment including sad grubby dirty dreary and humble but note that this implies that the digital revolution is dominated by people on laptops who have no furniture
similarly underwood and his associates are nattily clad barnes shows a lack of fashion recognition
the debut date was a weekend when there was little competition on television other than super bowl xlvii and a new episode of downton abbey on pbs
netflix broadcast chapter <num> and chapter <num> to critics several days in advance of the release
elements of the opening scene were lauded
matt roush of tv guide praised spacey 's self introduction as a machiavellian politician in which he says i have no patience for useless things
boston globe 's matthew gilbert noted that the first two episodes were expertly directed by david fincher and spacey 's harmonious cadence such as those used in the first scene of this episode makes even his character ’ s mercy killing of an injured dog — which he does by hand — seem a little less brutal
not only is underwood described as machiavellian one critic from the new york times notes that his belief in the omnipresence of dirt expressed as nobody ’ s a boy scout not even a boy scout harkens back to willie stark in all the king 's men who said there 's always something
time television critic james poniewozik notes that by the end of the first episode frank establishes that his metaphor of choice is meat because both literally and figuratively it is his preference
he may begin a day with a celebratory rack of ribs because i ’ m feelin ’ hungry today but also he describes life with meat metaphors he describes the white house chief of staff with grudging admiration she ’ s as tough as a two @-@ dollar steak
he plans to destroy an enemy the way you devour a whale
one bite at a time
and he endures a tedious weekly meeting with house leaders he tells us by imagining their lightly salted faces frying in a skillet
poniewozik notes that all of this comes from a character whose name underwood is a reference to the hallmark deviled ham of the william underwood company
roush also notes that the first two weeks show how claire runs a charity with a brutally iron fist
while frank is machiavellian claire presents a woman urging on her husband 's assertion of power in the image of lady macbeth
hank stuever of the washington post describes her as an ice @-@ queen wife
she encourages his vices while noting her disapproval of his weakness saying my husband doesn ’ t apologize
even to me
nancy dewolf smith of the wall street journal describes what she sees of their relationship in the first two episodes as pivotal to the show 's success benign though they may seem — and their harmless air is what makes the underwoods so effective as political plotters — this is a power couple with the same malignant chemistry as pairs of serial killers where each needs the other in order to become lethal
gilbert also notes that mara 's surprising naivete is a welcome respite against a backdrop of a terminally jaded cast
as the show begins aspiring journalist zoe barnes is desperate to rise from covering the fairfax county council beat to covering what 's behind the veil of power in the capitol hallways
alessandra stanley of the new york times notes that by the end of the first episode mara 's barnes is among the cadre of frank 's accomplices
after she pleads for a relationship with him by promising to earn his trust and not ask any questions frank uses her fiendishly
however ashley parker of the new york times considers her unfathomably aggressive and too overt transactional and sexual
parker points out that barnes statement i protect your identity i print what you tell me and i 'll never ask any questions almost discredits itself
the washington post 's stuever has many complaints about the show including the fact that it is about washington dc but filmed in baltimore
he also complains about its entrance into the television landscape littered with more fictitious administrations than anyone can keep track of
he says that perspective will affect your perception of the show
those not already inundated with type a personalities inside the beltway in their daily lives may be drawn to the show
however it is not likely a show that will serve well those who spend a lot of time with the issues that the show deals with
after viewing the first two episodes stuever also finds fault with the use of breaking the fourth wall describing it as the show 's unwise narrative trope
the wall street journal 's smith defends the fourth wall as an artifice that generally works well here to loosen our bearings
ryan mcgee of the a
v
club notes russo seems to employ vices without restraint which is a respite from the other exacting characters in the episode and a makes him a sort of metaphor for the show
mcgee also notes that the episode includes establishing shots within zoe ’ s apartment that offer up almost everything you need to know about her current position in life

kannada literature during this period consisted of writings relating to the socio @-@ religious developments of the jain and veerashaiva faiths and to a lesser extent that of the vaishnava faith
the earliest well @-@ known brahmin writers in kannada were from the hoysala court
while most of the courtly textual production was in kannada an important corpus of monastic vaishnava literature relating to dvaita dualistic philosophy was written by the renowned philosopher madhvacharya in sanskrit
writing kannada literature in native metres was first popularised by the court poets
these metres were the sangatya compositions sung to the accompaniment of a musical instrument shatpadi six @-@ line verses ragale lyrical compositions in blank verse and tripadi three @-@ line verses
however jain writers continued to use the traditional champu composed of prose and verse
important literary contributions in kannada were made not only by court poets but also by noblemen commanders ministers ascetics and saints associated with monasteries
during this period the hoysalas native kannadigas from the malnad region hill country in modern karnataka were on the ascendant as a political power
they are known to have existed as chieftains from the mid @-@ <num> century when they distinguished themselves as subordinates of the western chalukyas of kalyani
in <num> hoysala king vishnuvardhana defeated the cholas of tanjore and annexed gangavadi parts of modern southern karnataka thus bringing the region back under native rule
in the following decades with the waning of the chalukya power the hoysalas proclaimed independence and grew into one of the most powerful ruling families of southern india
consequently literature in kannada the local language flourished in the hoysala empire
this literature can be broadly subdivided as follows works dominated by the themes of jain writings contrasting works by veerashaiva writers not belonging to the vachana poetic tradition rebuttals to shaiva writings from jain writers early brahminical works vaishnava works from the birth of the bhakti devotional movement in the kannada @-@ speaking region writings on secular topics and the first writings in native metres ragale sangatya and shatpadi
as in earlier centuries jain authors wrote about tirthankars saints princes and other personages important to the jain religion
jain versions of the hindu epics such as the ramayana and bhagavata tales of hindu god krishna were also written
according to r
narasimhacharya a noted scholar on kannada literature more jain writers wrote in kannada than in any other dravidian language during the augustan age of kannada literature from the earliest known works to the <num> century
the veerashaiva writers devotees of the hindu god shiva wrote about his <num> forms in their expositions of shaivism
vaishnava authors wrote treatments of the hindu epics the ramayana the mahabharata and the bhagavata
breaking away from the old jain tradition of using the champu form for writing kannada literature harihara penned poems in the ragale metre in siva @-@ ganada @-@ ragalegalu <num>
his nephew raghavanka established the shatpadi tradition by writing a unique version of the story of king harishchandra in harishchandra kavya <num>
sisumayana introduced the sangatya metre in his anjanacharita and tripuradahana <num>
however some scholars continued to employ sanskritic genres such as champu ramachandra charitapurana shataka <num> verse compositions pampa sataka and ashtaka eight line verse compositions mudige ashtaka
the exact beginnings of the haridasa movement in the kannada @-@ speaking region have been disputed
belur keshavadasa a noted harikatha scholar claimed in his book karnataka bhaktavijaya that the movement was inspired by saint achalananda dasa of turvekere in the modern tumkur district in the <num> century
however neither the language used in achalananda dasa 's compositions nor the discovery of a composition with the pen name achalanada vitthala which mentions the <num> @-@ century philosopher madhvacharya lends support to the <num> @-@ century theory
naraharitirtha <num> one of earliest disciples of madhvacharya is therefore considered the earliest haridasa to write vaishnava compositions in kannada
secular topics were popular and included treatises on poetry sringararatnakara and writings on natural sciences rattasutra mathematics vyavaharaganita fiction lilavati grammar shabdamanidarpana rhetoric udayadityalankara and others
important contributions were made by some prominent literary families
one jain family produced several authors including mallikarjuna the noted anthologist <num> his brother @-@ in @-@ law janna <num> the court poet of king veera ballala ii mallikarjuna 's son keshiraja <num> considered by d
r
nagaraj a scholar on literary cultures in history to be the greatest theorist of kannada grammar and sumanobana who was in the court of king narasimha i and was the maternal grandfather of keshiraja
harihara <num> and his nephew raghavanka <num> poets who set the trend for using native metres came from a shaiva family devotees of the god shiva
the support of the hoysala rulers for the kannada language was strong and this is seen even in their epigraphs often written in polished and poetic language rather than prose with illustrations of floral designs in the margins
in addition to the hoysala patronage royal support was enjoyed by kannada poets and writers during this period in the courts of neighbouring kingdoms of the western deccan
the western chalukyas the southern kalachuris the seuna yadavas of devagiri and the silharas of kolhapur are some of the ruling families who enthusiastically used kannada in inscriptions and promoted its literature
writers bilingual in kannada and telugu gained popularity which caused interaction between the two languages a trend that continued into modern times
the veerashiva canon of the kannada language was translated or adapted into telugu from this time period
palkuriki somanatha <num> a devotee of social reformer basavanna is the most well @-@ known of these bilingual poets
the chola chieftain nannechoda c
<num> used many kannada words in his telugu writings
after the decline of the hoysala empire the vijayanagara empire kings further supported writers in both languages
in <num> inspired by palkuriki somanatha bhima kavi translated the telugu basavapurana to kannada and king deva raya ii c
<year> had chamarasa 's landmark writing prabhulingalile translated into telugu and tamil
many veerashaiva writers in the court of the <num> century kingdom of mysore were multilingual in kannada telugu and sanskrit while the srivaishnava a sect of vaishnavism kannada writers of the court were in competition with the telugu and sanskrit writers
information from contemporary records regarding several writers from this period whose works are considered lost include maghanandi probable author of rama kathe and guru of kamalabhava of <num> srutakirti guru of aggala and author of raghava pandaviya and possibly a jina @-@ stuti <num> sambha varma mentioned by nagavarma of <num> vira nandi chandraprabha kavyamala <num> dharani pandita bijjala raya charita and varangana charita amrita nandi dhanvantari nighantu vidyanatha prataparudriya ganeshvara sahitya sanjivana harabhakta a veerashaiva mendicant vedabhashya <num> and siva kavi author of basava purana in <num>
king vishnuvardhana wanted to perform vedic sacrifices befitting an emperor and surpass his overlords the western chalukyas in military and architectural achievements
this led to his conversion from jainism to vaishnavism
around the same time the well @-@ known philosopher ramanujacharya sought refuge from the cholas in hoysala territory and popularised the sri vaishnava faith a sect of hindu vaishnavism
although jains continued to dominate culturally in what is now the southern karnataka region for a while these social changes would later contribute to the decline of jain literary output
the growing political clout of the hoysalas attracted many bards and scholars to their court who in turn wrote panegyrics on their patrons
nagachandra a scholar and the builder of the mallinatha jinalaya a jain temple in honor of the <num> jain tirthankar mallinatha in bijapur karnataka wrote mallinathapurana <num> an account of the evolution of the soul of the jain saint
according to some historians king veera ballala i was his patron
later he wrote his magnum opus a jain version of the hindu epic ramayana called ramachandra charitapurana or pampa ramayana
written in the traditional champu metre and in the pauma charia tradition of vimalasuri it is the earliest extant version of the epic in the kannada language
the work contains <num> sections and deviates significantly from the original epic by valmiki
nagachandra represents king ravana the villain of the hindu epic as a tragic hero who in a moment of weakness commits the sin of abducting sita wife of the hindu god rama but is eventually purified by her devotion to rama
in a further deviation rama 's loyal brother lakshmana instead of rama kills ravana in the final battle
eventually rama takes jaina @-@ diksha converts to digambara monk becomes an ascetic and attains nirvana enlightenment
considered a complementary work to the pampa bharatha of adikavi pampa <num> a jain version of the epic mahabharata the work earned nagachandra the honorific abhinava pampa new pampa
only in the kannada language do jain versions exist of the hindu epics the mahabharata and ramayana in addition to their brahminical version
kanti <num> known for her wit and humour was one of the earliest female poets of the kannada language and a contemporary of nagachandra with whom she indulged in debates and repartees
rajaditya a native of either puvinabage or raibhag the modern belgaum district was in the hoysala court during the days of king veera ballala i and king vishnuvardhana
he wrote in easy verse on arithmetic and other mathematical topics and is credited with three of the earliest writings on mathematics in the kannada language vyavaharaganita kshetraganita and lilavati
udayaditya a chola prince authored a piece on rhetoric called udayadityalankara <num>
it was based on dandin 's sanskrit kavyadarsa
he is considered one of the most influential kannada poets of the hoysala era
a non @-@ traditionalist he has been called poet of poets and a poet for the masses
kannada poetry changed course because of his efforts and he was an inspiration for generations of poets to follow
impressed by his early writings kereya padmarasa the court poet of king narasimha i introduced him to the king who became harihara 's patron
a master of many metres he authored the girijakalyana marriage of the mountain born goddess – parvati in the kalidasa tradition employing the champu style to tell a <num> @-@ part story leading to the marriage of the god shiva and parvati
according to an anecdote harihara was so against eulogising earthly mortals that he struck his protégé raghavanka for writing about king harishchandra in the landmark work harishchandra kavya c
<num>
harihara is credited with developing the native ragale metre
the earliest poetic biographer in the kannada language he wrote a biography of basavanna called basavarajadevara ragale which gives interesting details about the protagonist while not always conforming to popular beliefs of the time
ascribed to him is a group of <num> poems called the nambiyanana ragale also called shivaganada ragale or saranacharitamanasa – the holy lake of the lives of the devotees after the saint nambiyana
in the sataka metre he wrote the pampa sataka and in the ashtaka metre the mudige ashtaka in about <num>
famous among vaishnava writers and the first brahmin writer of the smartha sect of repute rudrabhatta wrote jagannatha vijaya <num> in a style considered a transition between ancient and medieval kannada
chandramouli a minister in the court of king veera ballala ii was his patron
the writing in champu metre is about the life of the god krishna
leading to the god 's fight with banasura it is based on an earlier writing vishnupurana
nemichandra court poet of king veera ballala ii and the silhara king lakshmana of kholapur wrote lilavati prabandham <num> the earliest available true fiction and hence a novel in kannada with an erotic bent
written in the champu metre with the ancient town banavasi as the background it narrates the love story of a kadamba prince and a princess who eventually marry after facing many obstacles
the story is based on a c
<num> sanskrit original called vasavadatta by subhandu
his other work neminathapurana unfinished on account of his death and hence called ardhanemi or incomplete nemi details the life of the <num> jain tirthankar neminatha while treating the life of the god krishna from a jain angle
palkuriki somanatha a native of modern karnataka or andhra pradesh is considered one of the foremost multi @-@ lingual shaiva or shiva @-@ following poets of the <num> and <num> centuries
historians are divided about the time and place of his birth and death and his original faith
he was adept in the sanskrit telugu and kannada languages
he was a devotee of basavanna the founder of the veerashaiva movement and all his writings propagate that faith
it is generally accepted that he was born a brahmin and later adopted the shaiva faith although according to the scholar bandaru tammayya he was born a jangama follower of the shaiva faith
his time of birth has been identified as either the <num> century or late <num> century
in kannada his most important writings are silasampadane sahasragananama and pancharatna
his well @-@ known poems written in the ragale metre are basava ragale basavadhya ragale and sadguru ragale
he is known to have humbled many vaishnava poets in debates
other well @-@ known personalities from the <num> century included several jain writers
these include aggala who authored chandraprabhapurana <num> an account of the life of the eighth jain tirthankar chandraprabha sujanottamsa who wrote a panegyric on gomateshwara of shravanabelagola and vritta vilasa who authored sastra sara and dharmaparikshe <num>
the latter was vilasa 's version of the sanskrit original of the same name written by amitagati c
<num>
in this champu writing the author narrates the story of two kshatriya princess who went to benares and exposed the vices of the gods after discussions with the brahmins there
the author questions the credibility of hanuman the hindu monkey god and the vanaras monkey @-@ like humanoids in the hindu epic ramayana
although controversial the work sheds useful information on contemporary religious beliefs
kereya padmarasa a veerashaiva poet patronised by king narasimha i wrote dikshabodhe in the ragale metre in <num>
he would later become the protagonist of a biographical work called padmarajapurana written by his descendant padmanaka in c
<year>
the brahmin poet deva kavi authored a romance piece called kusumavali <num> and brahmin poet kavi kama <num> century authored a treatise called sringara @-@ ratnakara on the rasa flavor of poetical sentiment
sumanobana <num> was a poet @-@ grammarian and the katakacharya military teacher under king narasimha i
he was also a priest in devagiri the seuna yadava capital
according to l
s
seshagiri rao it is believed that in no other language has the story of king harishchandra been interpreted in this way
the writing is an original in tradition and inspiration that fully develops the potential of the shatpadi metre
the narration has many noteworthy elegiac verses such as the mourning of chandramati over the death of her young son lohitashva from snake bite
the very writing that made raghavanka famous was rejected by his guru harihara
his other well @-@ known writings adhering to strict shaiva principles and written to appease his guru are the siddharama charitra or siddharama purana a larger than life stylistic eulogy of the compassionate <num> @-@ century veerashaiva saint siddharama of sonnalige the somanatha charitra a propagandist work that describes the life of saint somayya or adaiah of puligere modern lakshmeshwar his humiliation by a jain girl and his revenge the viresvara charita a dramatic story of the blind wrath of a shaiva warrior virabhadra the hariharamahatva an account of the life of harisvara of hampi and sarabha charitra
the last two classics are considered lost
in <num> the jain scholar minister builder of temples and army commander janna wrote among other classics yashodhara charite a unique set of stories in <num> verses dealing with sadomasochism transmigration of the soul passion gone awry and cautionary morals for human conduct
the writing although inspired by vadiraja 's sanskrit classic of the same name is noted for its original interpretation imagery and style
in one story the poet tells of the infatuation of a man for his friend 's wife
having killed his friend the man abducts the wife who dies of grief
overcome by repentance he burns himself on the funeral pyre of the woman
the stories of infatuation reach a peak when janna writes about the attraction of amrutamati the queen to the ugly mahout ashtavakra who pleases the queen with kicks and whip lashes
this story has piqued the interest of modern researchers
in honour of this work janna received the title kavichakravarthi emperor among poets from his patron king veera ballala ii
his other classic anathanatha purana <num> is an account of the life of the <num> tirthankar ananthanatha
andayya taking a non @-@ conformist path that was never repeated in kannada literature wrote madana vijaya triumph of cupid <num> – <num> using only pure kannada words desya and naturalized sanskrit words tadbhava and totally avoiding assimilated sanskrit words tatsamas
this is seen by some as a rebuttal meant to prove that writing kannada literature without borrowed sanskrit words was possible
the poem narrates the story of the moon being imprisoned by the god shiva in his abode in the himalayas
in his anger kama cupid the god of love also called manmata assailed shiva with his arrows only to be cursed by shiva and separated from his beloved
kama then contrived to rid himself of shiva 's curse
the work also goes by other names such as sobagina suggi harvest of beauty kavane gella cupid 's conquest and kabbigara @-@ kava poets defender
kama has an important place in jain writings even before andayya
the possibility that this writing was yet another subtle weapon in the intensifying conflict between the dominant jains and the veerashaivas whose popularity was on the rise is not lost on historians
mallikarjuna a jain ascetic compiled an anthology of poems called suktisudharnava gems from the poets in <num> in the court of king vira someshwara
some interesting observations have been made by scholars about this important undertaking
while the anthology itself provides insight into poetic tastes of that period and hence qualifies as a history of kannada literature it also performs the function of a guide for poets an assertive method of bridging the gap between courtly literary intelligentsia and folk poetry
being a guide for professional intellectuals the work true to its nature often includes poems eulogising kings and royalty but completely ignoring poems of the <num> @-@ century vachana canon veerashaiva folk literature
however the selection of poems includes contributions from harihara the non @-@ conformist veerashaiva writer
this suggests a compromise by which the author attempts to include the rebels
other notable writers of the early <num> century were bhanduvarma author of harivamsabhyudaya and jiva sambhodana <num> the latter bearing on morals and renunciation and written addressing the soul balachandra kavi kandarpa the author of the belgaum fort inscription who claimed to be master of four languages maghanandycharya the author of an extinct commentary on the jain theological work sastrasara samuccaya @-@ tiku <num> for which there are references and the available commentary called padarthasara giving a complete explanation of sanskrit and prakrit authoritative citations hastimalla who wrote purvapurana chandrama author of karkala gomateshvara charite and sisumayana who introduced a new form of composition called sangatya in <num>
he wrote an allegorical poem called tripuradahana burning of the triple fortress and anjanacharita
the latter work was inspired by ravisena 's sanskrit padma charitra
somaraja a veerashaiva scholar wrote a eulogy of udbhata the ruler of gersoppa and called it sringarasara or udbhatakavya <num>
other jain writers were parsva pandita author of paravanathapurana and gunavarma ii the author of the story of the ninth jain tirthankar pushpadanta called pushpadanta purana both were patronised by the ratta kings of saundatti
polalva dandanatha a commander minister and the builder of the harihareshwara temple in harihar wrote haricharitra in <num>
he was patronised by king veera ballala ii and his successor king vira narasimha ii
puligere somanatha authored a book on morals called somesvarasataka
he came from a family of famous poet @-@ writers
although five of keshiraja 's writings are not traceable his most enduring work on kannada grammar shabdamanidarpana mirror of word jewels <num> is available and testifies to his scholarly acumen and literary taste
true to his wish that his writing on grammar should last as long as the sun the moon the oceans and the meru mountain lasted shabdamanidarpana is popular even today and is considered a standard authority on old kannada grammar
it is prescribed as a textbook for students of graduate and post @-@ graduate studies in the kannada language
although keshiraja followed the model of sanskrit grammar of the katantra school and that of earlier writings on kannada grammar by king amoghavarsha i of the <num> century and grammarian nagavarma ii of <num> his work has originality
keshiraja 's lost writings are cholapalaka charitam sri chitramale shubhadraharana prabodhachandra and kiratam or kiratarjuniyam
a major development of this period that would have a profound impact on kannada literature even into the modern age was the birth of the haridasa servants of hari or vishnu movement
this devotional movement although reminiscent in some ways of the veerashaiva movement of the <num> century which produced vachana poetry and taught devotion to the god shiva was in contrast intimately devoted to the hindu god vishnu as the supreme god
the inspiration behind this movement was the philosophy of madhvacharya of udupi
naraharitirtha <num> is considered the first well @-@ known haridasa and composer of vaishnava devotional songs in kannada
before his induction into the madhva order he had served as a minister in the court of kalinga
the vaishnava poetry however disappeared for about two centuries after naraharitirtha 's death before resurfacing as a popular form of folk literature during the rule of the vijayanagara empire
only three of naraharitirtha 's compositions are available today
other writers worthy of mention are mahabala kavi the author of neminathapurana <num> an account of the <num> jain tirthankar neminatha and kumudendu author of a jain version of the epic ramayana in shatpadi metre called kumudendu ramayana in <num>
the effort was influenced by pampa ramayana of nagachandra
kumara padmarasa son of kereya padmarasa wrote the sananda charitre in shatpadi metre
ratta kavi a jain noble wrote a quasi @-@ scientific piece called rattasutra or rattamala in <num>
the writing bears on natural phenomena such rain earthquakes lightning planets and omens
a commentary on the amara khosa considered useful to students of the language called amara khosa vyakhyana was written by the jain writer nachiraja <num>
towards the end of the hoysala rule nagaraja wrote punyasrava in <num> in champu style a work that narrates the stories of puranic heroes in <num> tales and is said to be a translation from sanskrit
fleeing possible persecution from the chola king who was a shaiva ramanujacharya sought refuge initially in tondanur and later moved to melkote
but this event had no impact on vaishnava literature in hoysala lands at that time
however the teachings of madhvacharya <num> – <num> propounder of the dvaita philosophy did have a direct impact on vaishnava literature in both the sanskrit and kannada languages
this body of writings is known as haridasa sahitya haridasa literature
born as vasudeva in pajaka village near udupi in <num> he learnt the vedas and upanishads under his guru achyutapreksha
he was initiated into sanyasa asceticism after which he earned the name madhvacharya or anandatirtha
later he disagreed with the views of his guru and began to travel india
he successfully debated with many scholars and philosophers during this time and won over naraharitirtha a minister in kalinga who would later become madhvacharya 's first notable disciple
unlike adi shankaracharya <num> – <num> who preached advaita philosophy monism and ramanujacharya who propounded vishishtadvaita philosophy qualified monism madhvacharya taught the dvaita philosophy dualism
madhvacharya taught complete devotion to the hindu god vishnu emphasising jnanamarga or the path of knowledge and insisted that the path of devotion can help a soul to attain elevation athmonathi
he was however willing to accept devotion to other hindu deities as well
he wrote <num> works in sanskrit including dwadasha sutra in which his devotion to the god vishnu found full expression gita bhashya gita tatparya nirnaya mahabharata tatparya nirnaya bhagavata tatparya nirnaya mayavada khandana and vishnu tattwa nirnaya
to propagate his teachings he established eight monasteries near udupi the uttaradhi monastery and the raghavendra monastery in mantralayam in modern andhra pradesh and nanjanagud near modern mysore
the writings of madhvacharya and vidyatirtha author of rudraprshnabhashya may have been absorbed by sayanacharya brother of vidyaranya the patron saint of the founders of the vijayanagara empire in the <num> century
bharatasvamin who was patronised by hoysala king ramanatha wrote a commentary on samaveda shadgurusishya wrote commentary on aitareya brahmana and aranyaka and katyayana wrote sarvanukramani
a family of hereditary poets whose names have not been identified held the title vidyachakravarti poet laureate in the hoysala court
one of them wrote gadyakarnamrita a description of the war between hoysala king vira narasimha ii and the pandyas in the early <num> century
his grandson with the same title in the court of king veera ballala iii composed a poem called rukminikalyana in <num> kandas chapters and wrote commentaries on poetics on the alankarasarvasva and kavyaprakasa
kalyani devi a sister of madhvacharya and trivikrama his disciple wrote commentaries on the dvaita philosophy
to trivikrama is ascribed a poem narrating the story of usha and aniruddha called ushaharana
narayana pandita composed madhwavijaya manimanjari and a poem called parijataharana
the jain writer ramachandra maladhari authored gurupanchasmriti
these developments popularised folk metres which shifted the emphasis towards desi native or folk forms of literature
with the waning of jain literary output competition between the veerashaiva and vaishnava writers came to the fore
the veerashaiva writer chamarasa author of prabhulingalile <year> and his vaishnava competitor kumaravyasa karnata bharata kathamanjari <year> popularised the shatpadi metric tradition initiated by hoysala poet raghavanka in the court of vijayanagara king deva raya ii
lakshmisa the <num> – <num> century writer of epic poems continued the tradition in the jaimini bharata a work that has remained popular even in the modern period
the tripadi metre one of the oldest in the kannada language kappe arabhatta inscription of <num> which was used by akka mahadevi yoganna trividhi <num> was popularised in the <num> century by the mendicant poet sarvajna
even jain writers who had dominated courtly literature throughout the classical period with their sanskritic champu style began to use native metres
among them ratnakaravarni is famous for successfully integrating an element of worldly pleasure into asceticism and for treating the topic of eroticism with discretion in a religious epic written in the native sangatya metre a metre initiated by hoysala poet sisumayana his magnum opus the bharatadesa vaibhava c
<year>
though the vaishnava courtly writings in kannada began with the hoysala poet rudrabhatta and the devotional song genre was initiated by naraharitirtha the vaishnava movement began to exert a strong influence on kannada literature only from the <num> century on
the vaishnava writers consisted of two groups who seemed to have no interaction with each other the brahmin commentators who typically wrote under the patronage of royalty and the bhakti devotion writers also known as haridasas who played no role in courtly matters
the bhakti writers took the message of god to the people in the form of melodious songs composed using folk genres such as the kirthane a musical composition with refrain based on tune and rhythm the suladi a composition based on rhythm and the ugabhoga a composition based on melody
kumara vyasa and timmanna kavi were well @-@ known among the brahmin commentators while purandara dasa and kanaka dasa were the most notable of the bhakti writers
the philosophy of madhvacharya which originated in the kannada @-@ speaking region in the <num> century spread beyond its borders over the next two centuries
the itinerant haridasas best described as mystic saint @-@ poets spread the philosophy of madhvacharya in simple kannada winning mass appeal by preaching devotion to god and extolling the virtues of jnana enlightenment bhakti devotion and vairagya detachment
vachana poetry developed in reaction to the rigid caste @-@ based hindu society attained its peak in popularity among the under @-@ privileged during the <num> century
though these poems did not employ any regular metre or rhyme scheme they are known to have originated from the earlier tripadi metrical form
the veerashaivas who wrote this poetry had risen to influential positions by the vijayanagara period <num> century
court ministers and nobility belonging to the faith such as lakkanna dandesa and jakkanarya not only wrote literature but also patronised talented writers and poets
veerashaiva anthologists of the <num> and <num> centuries began to collect shaiva writings and vachana poems originally written on palm leaf manuscripts
because of the cryptic nature of the poems the anthologists added commentaries to them thereby providing their hidden meaning and esoteric significance
an interesting aspect of this anthological work was the translation of the shaiva canon into sanskrit bringing it into the sphere of the sanskritic marga or mainstream as opposed to desi or folk cultural order

a karachi @-@ based cinema posted on its facebook page that the film would not be screened due to restrictions by the censor board
the censorship was due to the film 's depiction of pakistan as an unstable state and the fictional portrayal of a foreign invasion of pakistan ’ s nuclear installations which caught the ire of film censor authorities
consequently restrictions were imposed on screening the movie countrywide
according to an official at the censor board the film portrayed pakistan negatively not only on the issue of the war on terror but also on the international standing of the country there is a scene which shows the assassination of the pakistani president and the imposition of martial law which is not a fair representation of the country
another cinema official explained there were obviously several objectionable things which would never have passed the censors but these things are also relevant to the content of the film

its range from the canadian yukon to the southern andes of south america is the greatest of any large wild terrestrial mammal in the western hemisphere
an adaptable generalist species the cougar is found in most american habitat types
it is the second @-@ heaviest cat in the new world after the jaguar
secretive and largely solitary by nature the cougar is properly considered both nocturnal and crepuscular although there are daytime sightings
the cougar is more closely related to smaller felines including the domestic cat subfamily felinae than to any species of subfamily pantherinae of which only the jaguar is native to the americas
the cougar is an ambush predator and pursues a wide variety of prey
primary food sources are ungulates particularly deer but also livestock
it also hunts species as small as insects and rodents
this cat prefers habitats with dense underbrush and rocky areas for stalking but can also live in open areas
the cougar is territorial and survives at low population densities
individual territory sizes depend on terrain vegetation and abundance of prey
while large it is not always the apex predator in its range yielding to the jaguar gray wolf american black bear and grizzly bear
it is reclusive and mostly avoids people
fatal attacks on humans are rare but have recently been increasing in north america as more people enter their territories
prolific hunting following european colonization of the americas and the ongoing human development of cougar habitat has caused populations to drop in most parts of its historical range
in particular the cougar was extirpated in eastern north america in the beginning of the <num> century except for an isolated florida panther subpopulation
breeding populations have moved east into the far western parts of the dakotas nebraska and oklahoma
transient males have been verified in minnesota missouri wisconsin iowa the upper peninsula of michigan and illinois where a cougar was shot in the city limits of chicago and in at least one instance observed as far east as coastal connecticut

concolor has dozens of names and various references in the mythology of the indigenous americans and in contemporary culture
currently it is referred to as puma by most scientists and by the populations in <num> of the <num> countries in the americas where puma is the common name in spanish or portuguese
the cat has many local or regional names in the united states and canada of which cougar puma mountain lion and panther are popular
mountain lion was a term first used in writing in <year> from the diary of george a
jackson of colorado
other names include catamount probably a contraction from cat of the mountain mountain screamer and painter
lexicographers regard painter as a primarily upper @-@ southern us regional variant on panther

concolor holds the guinness record for the animal with the greatest number of names with over <num> in english alone
cougar may be borrowed from the archaic portuguese çuçuarana the term was originally derived from the tupi language susua 'rana meaning similar to deer in hair color
a current form in brazil is suçuarana
it may also be borrowed from the guaraní language term guaçu ara or guazu ara
less common portuguese terms are onça @-@ parda brown onça in distinction of the black @-@ spotted yellow one onça @-@ pintada the jaguar or leão @-@ baio lit
chestnut lion or unusually non @-@ native puma or leão @-@ da @-@ montanha more common names for the animal when native to a region other than south america especially for those who do not know that suçuaranas are found elsewhere but with a different name
people in rural regions often refer to both the cougar and the jaguar as simply gata she @-@ cat and outside of the amazon both are colloquially referred to as simply onça by many people that is also a name for the leopard in angola
in the <num> century german naturalist georg marcgrave named the cat the cuguacu ara
marcgrave 's rendering was reproduced by his associate dutch naturalist willem piso in <year>
cuguacu ara was then adopted by english naturalist john ray in <year>
the french naturalist georges @-@ louis leclerc comte de buffon in <year> probably influenced by the word jaguar converted the cuguacu ara to cuguar which was later modified to cougar in english
the first english record of puma was in <year> where it had come from the spanish who in turn borrowed it from the peruvian quechua language in the <num> century where it means powerful
they are placed in the subfamily felinae although their bulk characteristics are similar to those of the big cats in the subfamily pantherinae
the family felidae is believed to have originated in asia about <num> million years ago
taxonomic research on felids remains partial and much of what is known about their evolutionary history is based on mitochondrial dna analysis as cats are poorly represented in the fossil record and significant confidence intervals exist with suggested dates
in the latest genomic study of the felidae the common ancestor of today 's leopardus lynx puma prionailurus and felis lineages migrated across the bering land bridge into the americas <num>
<num> to <num>
<num> million years ago mya
the lineages subsequently diverged in that order
north american felids then invaded south america <num> mya as part of the great american interchange following formation of the isthmus of panama
the cougar was originally thought to belong in felis felis concolor the genus which includes the domestic cat
as of <year> it is now placed in puma along with the jaguarundi a cat just a little more than a tenth its weight
the cougar and jaguarundi are most closely related to the modern cheetah of africa and western asia but the relationship is unresolved
the cheetah lineage is suggested by some studies to have diverged from the puma lineage in the americas see american cheetah and migrated back to asia and africa while other research suggests the cheetah diverged in the old world itself
the outline of small feline migration to the americas is thus unclear
a high level of genetic similarity has been found among north american cougar populations suggesting they are all fairly recent descendants of a small ancestral group
culver et al

concolor was extirpated during the pleistocene extinctions some <num> @,@ <num> years ago when other large mammals such as smilodon also disappeared

the head of the cat is round and the ears are erect
its powerful forequarters neck and jaw serve to grasp and hold large prey
it has five retractable claws on its forepaws one a dewclaw and four on its hind paws
the larger front feet and claws are adaptations to clutching prey
cougars can be almost as large as jaguars but are less muscular and not as powerfully built where their ranges overlap the cougar tends to be smaller on average
besides the jaguar the cougar is on average larger than all felids apart from lions and tigers
despite its size it is not typically classified among the big cats as it cannot roar lacking the specialized larynx and hyoid apparatus of panthera
compared to big cats cougars are often silent with minimal communication through vocalizations outside of the mother @-@ offspring relationship
cougars sometimes voice low @-@ pitched hisses growls and purrs as well as chirps and whistles many of which are comparable to those of domestic cats
they are well known for their screams as referenced in some of their common names although these screams are often misinterpreted to be the calls of other animals
cougar coloring is plain hence the latin concolor but can vary greatly between individuals and even between siblings
the coat is typically tawny but ranges to silvery @-@ grey or reddish with lighter patches on the underbody including the jaws chin and throat
infants are spotted and born with blue eyes and rings on their tails juveniles are pale and dark spots remain on their flanks
despite anecdotes to the contrary all @-@ black coloring melanism has never been documented in cougars
the term black panther is used colloquially to refer to melanistic individuals of other species particularly jaguars and leopards
cougars have large paws and proportionally the largest hind legs in the cat family
this physique allows it great leaping and short @-@ sprint ability
the cougar is able to leap as high as <num>
<num> m <num> ft in one bound and as far as <num> to <num> ft <num> to <num>
<num> m horizontally
the cougar 's top running speed ranges between <num> and <num> km h <num> and <num> mph but is best adapted for short powerful sprints rather than long chases
it is adept at climbing which allows it to evade canine competitors
although it is not strongly associated with water it can swim
like all cats it is an obligate carnivore meaning it needs to feed exclusively on meat to survive
the mean weight of vertebrate prey mwvp that pumas attack increases with the puma 's body weight in general mwvp is lower in areas closer to the equator
its most important prey species are various deer species particularly in north america mule deer white @-@ tailed deer elk and even bull moose are taken
other species such as the bighorn and dall 's sheep horse fallow deer caribou mountain goat coyote pronghorn and domestic livestock such as cattle and sheep are also primary food bases in many areas
a survey of north america research found <num> of prey items were ungulates especially deer
only the florida panther showed variation often preferring feral hogs and armadillos
investigation in yellowstone national park showed that elk followed by mule deer were the cougar 's primary targets the prey base is shared with the park 's gray wolves with which the cougar competes for resources
another study on winter kills november – april in alberta showed that ungulates accounted for greater than <num> of the cougar diet
learned individual prey recognition was observed as some cougars rarely killed bighorn sheep while others relied heavily on the species
in pacific rim national park reserve scat samples showed raccoons to make up <num> of the cougar 's diet harbor seals and blacktail deer <num> each north american river otters <num> california sea lion <num> and american mink <num> the remaining <num> were unidentified
in the central and south american cougar range the ratio of deer in the diet declines
small to mid @-@ sized mammals are preferred including large rodents such as the capybara
ungulates accounted for only <num> of prey items in one survey about half that of north america
competition with the larger jaguar has been suggested for the decline in the size of prey items
other listed prey species of the cougar include mice porcupines beavers raccoons hares guanaco peccary vicuna rhea and wild turkey
birds and small reptiles are sometimes preyed upon in the south but this is rarely recorded in north america
not all of their prey is listed here due to their large range
though capable of sprinting the cougar is typically an ambush predator
it stalks through brush and trees across ledges or other covered spots before delivering a powerful leap onto the back of its prey and a suffocating neck bite
the cougar is capable of breaking the neck of some of its smaller prey with a strong bite and momentum bearing the animal to the ground
kills are generally estimated around one large ungulate every two weeks
the period shrinks for females raising young and may be as short as one kill every three days when cubs are nearly mature around <num> months
the cat drags a kill to a preferred spot covers it with brush and returns to feed over a period of days
the cougar is generally reported to not be a scavenger and rarely consumes prey it has not killed but deer carcasses left exposed for study were scavenged by cougars in california suggesting more opportunistic behavior
they typically average one litter every two to three years throughout their reproductive lives though the period can be as short as one year
females are in estrus for about <num> days of a <num> @-@ day cycle the gestation period is approximately <num> days
females are sometimes reported as monogamous but this is uncertain and polygyny may be more common
copulation is brief but frequent
chronic stress can result in low reproductive rates when in captivity as well as in the field
only females are involved in parenting
female cougars are fiercely protective of their cubs and have been seen to successfully fight off animals as large as grizzly bears in their defense
litter size is between one and six cubs typically two
caves and other alcoves that offer protection are used as litter dens
born blind cubs are completely dependent on their mother at first and begin to be weaned at around three months of age
as they grow they begin to go out on forays with their mother first visiting kill sites and after six months beginning to hunt small prey on their own
kitten survival rates are just over one per litter
when cougars are born they have spots but they lose them as they grow and by the age of <num> <num> <num> years they will completely be gone young adults leave their mother to attempt to establish their own territory at around two years of age and sometimes earlier males tend to leave sooner
one study has shown high mortality amongst cougars that travel farthest from the maternal range often due to conflicts with other cougars intraspecific competition
research in new mexico has shown that males dispersed significantly farther than females were more likely to traverse large expanses of non @-@ cougar habitat and were probably most responsible for nuclear gene flow between habitat patches
life expectancy in the wild is reported at eight to <num> years and probably averages eight to <num> a female of at least <num> years was reported killed by hunters on vancouver island
cougars may live as long as <num> years in captivity
one male north american cougar p
c
couguar named scratch was two months short of his <num> birthday when he died in <year>
causes of death in the wild include disability and disease competition with other cougars starvation accidents and where allowed human hunting
feline immunodeficiency virus an endemic hiv @-@ like virus in cats is well @-@ adapted to the cougar
only mothers and kittens live in groups with adults meeting only to mate
it is secretive and crepuscular being most active around dawn and dusk
estimates of territory sizes vary greatly
canadian geographic reports large male territories of <num> to <num> km2 <num> to <num> sq mi with female ranges half the size
other research suggests a much smaller lower limit of <num> km2 <num> sq mi but an even greater upper limit of <num> km2 <num> sq mi for males
in the united states very large ranges have been reported in texas and the black hills of the northern great plains in excess of <num> km2 <num> sq mi
male ranges may include or overlap with those of females but at least where studied not with those of other males which serves to reduce conflict between cougars
ranges of females may overlap slightly with each other
scrape marks urine and feces are used to mark territory and attract mates
males may scrape together a small pile of leaves and grasses and then urinate on it as a way of marking territory
home range sizes and overall cougar abundance depend on terrain vegetation and prey abundance
one female adjacent to the san andres mountains for instance was found with a large range of <num> km2 <num> sq mi necessitated by poor prey abundance
research has shown cougar abundances from <num>
<num> animals to as much as <num> in one study in south america per <num> km2 <num> sq mi
because males disperse farther than females and compete more directly for mates and territory they are most likely to be involved in conflict
where a subadult fails to leave his maternal range for example he may be killed by his father
when males encounter each other they hiss spit and may engage in violent conflict if neither backs down
hunting or relocation of the cougar may increase aggressive encounters by disrupting territories and bringing young transient animals into conflict with established individuals
its range spans <num> degrees of latitude from northern yukon in canada to the southern andes
its wide distribution stems from its adaptability to virtually every habitat type it is found in all forest types as well as in lowland and mountainous deserts
the cougar prefers regions with dense underbrush but can live with little vegetation in open areas
its preferred habitats include precipitous canyons escarpments rim rocks and dense brush
the cougar was extirpated across much of its eastern north american range with the exception of florida in the two centuries after european colonization and faced grave threats in the remainder of its territory
currently it ranges across most western american states the canadian provinces of alberta saskatchewan and british columbia and the canadian territory of yukon
there have been widely debated reports of possible recolonization of eastern north america
dna evidence has suggested its presence in eastern north america while a consolidated map of cougar sightings shows numerous reports from the mid @-@ western great plains through to eastern canada
the quebec wildlife services known locally as mrnf also considers cougar to be present in the province as a threatened species after multiple dna tests confirmed cougar hair in lynx mating sites
the only unequivocally known eastern population is the florida panther which is critically endangered
there have been unconfirmed sightings in elliotsville plantation maine north of monson and in new hampshire there have been unconfirmed sightings as early as <year>
in <year> the michigan department of natural resources confirmed a cougar sighting in michigan 's upper peninsula
typically extreme @-@ range sightings of cougars involve young males which can travel great distances to establish ranges away from established males all four confirmed cougar kills in iowa since <year> involved males
on april <num> <year> police shot and killed a cougar on the north side of chicago illinois
dna tests were consistent with cougars from the black hills of south dakota
less than a year later on march <num> <year> a cougar was photographed and unsuccessfully tranquilized by state wildlife biologists in a tree near spooner wisconsin in the northwestern part of the state
other eastern sightings since <year> have occurred in locations such as greene county indiana greenwich and milford connecticut morgan county pike county and whiteside county illinois and bourbon county kentucky
south of the rio grande the international union for the conservation of nature and natural resources iucn lists the cat in every central and south american country
while specific state and provincial statistics are often available in north america much less is known about the cat in its southern range
the cougar 's total breeding population is estimated at less than <num> @,@ <num> by the iucn with a declining trend
us state @-@ level statistics are often more optimistic suggesting cougar populations have rebounded
in oregon a healthy population of <num> @,@ <num> was reported in <year> exceeding a target of <num> @,@ <num>
california has actively sought to protect the cat and a similar number of cougars has been suggested between <num> @,@ <num> and <num> @,@ <num>
in <year> research in río los cipreses national reserve chile based in <num> motion @-@ sensitive cameras counted a population of two males and two females one of them with at least two cubs in an area of <num> km2 that is <num>
<num> cougars every <num> km2
the yellowstone national park ecosystem provides a fruitful microcosm to study inter @-@ predator interaction in north america
of the three large predators the massive grizzly bear appears dominant often although not always able to drive both the gray wolf pack and the cougar off their kills
one study found that american black bears visited <num> of cougar kills in yellowstone and glacier national parks usurping <num> of carcasses
bears gained up to <num> and cougars lost up to <num> of their respective daily energy requirements from these encounters
accounts of cougars and black bears killing each other in fights to the death have been documented from the <num> century
in spite of the size and power of the cougar there have also been accounts of both brown and black bears killing cougars either in disputes or in self @-@ defense
the gray wolf and the cougar compete more directly for prey especially in winter
wolves can steal kills and occasionally kill the cat
one report describes a large pack of <num> to <num> wolves killing a female cougar and her kittens
conversely lone female or young wolves are vulnerable to predation and have been reported ambushed and killed by cougars
various accounts of cougars killing lone wolves including a six @-@ year @-@ old female have also been documented
wolves more broadly affect cougar population dynamics and distribution by dominating territory and prey opportunities and disrupting the feline 's behavior
preliminary research in yellowstone for instance has shown displacement of the cougar by wolves
in nearby sun valley idaho a cougar wolf encounter that resulted in the death of the cougar was documented
one researcher in oregon noted when there is a pack around cougars are not comfortable around their kills or raising kittens
a lot of times a big cougar will kill a wolf but the pack phenomenon changes the table
both species meanwhile are capable of killing mid @-@ sized predators such as bobcats and coyotes and tend to suppress their numbers
although cougars can kill coyotes the latter have been documented attempting to prey on cougar cubs
in the southern portion of its range the cougar and jaguar share overlapping territory
the jaguar tends to take larger prey and the cougar smaller where they overlap reducing the cougar 's size and also further reducing the likelihood of direct competition
of the two felines the cougar appears best able to exploit a broader prey niche and smaller prey
as with any predator at or near the top of its food chain the cougar impacts the population of prey species
predation by cougars has been linked to changes in the species mix of deer in a region
for example a study in british columbia observed that the population of mule deer a favored cougar prey was declining while the population of the less frequently preyed @-@ upon white @-@ tailed deer was increasing
the vancouver island marmot an endangered species endemic to one region of dense cougar population has seen decreased numbers due to cougar and gray wolf predation
nevertheless there is a measurable effect on the quality of deer populations by puma predation
in the southern part of south america the puma is a top level predator that has controlled the population of guanaco and other species since prehistoric times
three sets of these hybrids were bred in the late <num> and early <num> by carl hagenbeck at his animal park in hamburg germany
most did not reach adulthood
one of these was purchased in <year> by berlin zoo
a similar hybrid in berlin zoo purchased from hagenbeck was a cross between a male leopard and a female puma
hamburg zoo 's specimen was the reverse pairing the one in the black @-@ and @-@ white photo fathered by a puma bred to an indian leopardess
whether born to a female puma mated to a male leopard or to a male puma mated to a female leopard pumapards inherit a form of dwarfism
those reported grew to only half the size of the parents
they have a puma @-@ like long body proportional to the limbs but nevertheless shorter than either parent but short legs
the coat is variously described as sandy tawny or greyish with brown chestnut or faded rosettes
the cougar is regulated under appendix i of the convention on international trade in endangered species of wild fauna and flora cites rendering illegal international trade in specimens or parts
in the united states east of the mississippi river the only unequivocally known cougar population is the florida panther
until <year> the united states fish and wildlife service usfws recognized both an eastern cougar claimed to be a subspecies by some denied by others and the florida panther affording protection under the endangered species act
certain taxonomic authorities have collapsed both designations into the north american cougar with eastern or florida subspecies not recognized while a subspecies designation remains recognized by some conservation scientists
in <year> the documented count for the florida sub @-@ population was <num> individuals
in march <year> the usfws declared the eastern cougar extinct
with the taxonomic uncertainty about its existence as a subspecies as well as the possibility of eastward migration of cougars from the western range the subject remains open
this uncertainty has been recognized by canadian authorities
the canadian federal agency called committee on the status of endangered wildlife in canada rates its current data as insufficient to draw conclusions regarding the eastern cougar 's survival and says on its web site despite many sightings in the past two decades from eastern canada there are insufficient data to evaluate the taxonomy or assign a status to this cougar
notwithstanding numerous reported sightings in ontario quebec new brunswick and nova scotia it has been said that the evidence is inconclusive
there may not be a distinct eastern subspecies and some sightings may be of escaped pets
the cougar is also protected across much of the rest of its range
as of <year> cougar hunting was prohibited in argentina brazil bolivia chile colombia costa rica french guiana guatemala honduras nicaragua panama paraguay suriname venezuela and uruguay
the cat had no reported legal protection in ecuador el salvador and guyana
regulated cougar hunting is still common in the united states and canada although they are protected from all hunting in the yukon it is permitted in every u
s
state from the rocky mountains to the pacific ocean with the exception of california
texas is the only state in the united states with a viable population of cougars that does not protect that population in some way
in texas cougars are listed as nuisance wildlife and any person holding a hunting or a trapping permit can kill a cougar regardless of the season number killed sex or age of the animal
killed animals are not required to be reported to texas parks and wildlife department
conservation work in texas is the effort of a non @-@ profit organization balanced ecology inc bei as part of their texas mountain lion conservation project
cougars are generally hunted with packs of dogs until the animal is treed
when the hunter arrives on the scene he shoots the cat from the tree at close range
the cougar cannot be legally killed without a permit in california except under very specific circumstances such as when a cougar is in act of pursuing livestock or domestic animals or is declared a threat to public safety
permits are issued when owners can prove property damage on their livestock or pets
for example multiple dogs have been attacked and killed sometimes while with the owner
many attribute this to the protection cougars have from being hunted and are now becoming desensitized to humans most are removed from the population after the attacks have already occurred
statistics from the department of fish and game indicate that cougar killings in california have been on the rise since the <num> with an average of over <num> cats killed per year from <year> to <year> compared to six per year in the <num>
they also state on their website that there is a healthy number of cougars in california
the bay area puma project aims to obtain information on cougar populations in the san francisco bay area and the animals interactions with habitat prey humans and residential communities
conservation threats to the species include persecution as a pest animal environmental degradation and habitat fragmentation and depletion of their prey base
wildlife corridors and sufficient range areas are critical to the sustainability of cougar populations
research simulations have shown that the animal faces a low extinction risk in areas of <num> km2 <num> sq mi or more
as few as one to four new animals entering a population per decade markedly increases persistence foregrounding the importance of habitat corridors
on march <num> <year> the united states fish and wildlife service declared the eastern cougar puma concolor couguar officially extinct
the inca city of cusco is reported to have been designed in the shape of a cougar and the animal also gave its name to both inca regions and people
the moche people represented the puma often in their ceramics
the sky and thunder god of the inca viracocha has been associated with the animal
in north america mythological descriptions of the cougar have appeared in the stories of the hocąk language ho @-@ chunk or winnebago of wisconsin and illinois and the cheyenne amongst others
to the apache and walapai of arizona the wail of the cougar was a harbinger of death
the algonquins and ojibwe believe that the cougar lived in the underworld and was wicked whereas it was a sacred animal among the cherokee
according to figures in texas in <year> <num> calves <num>
<num> of a total of <num>
<num> million cattle calves in texas <num> mohair goats <num> mohair kids <num> sheep <num>
<num> of a total of <num>
<num> million sheep lambs in texas and <num> lambs <num>
<num> of <num>
<num> million lambs in texas were confirmed to have been killed by cougars that year
in nevada in <year> cougars were confirmed to have killed <num> calves <num> horse <num> foals <num> goats <num> sheep and <num> lambs
in both cases sheep were the most frequently attacked
some instances of surplus killing have resulted in the deaths of <num> sheep in one attack
a cougar 's killing bite is applied to the back of the neck head or throat and they inflict puncture marks with their claws usually seen on the sides and underside of the prey sometimes also shredding the prey as they hold on
coyotes also typically bite the throat region but do not inflict the claw marks and farmers will normally see the signature zig @-@ zag pattern that coyotes create as they feed on the prey whereas cougars typically drag in a straight line
the work of a cougar is generally clean differing greatly from the indiscriminate mutilation by coyotes and feral dogs
the size of the tooth puncture marks also helps distinguish kills made by cougars from those made by smaller predators
remedial hunting appears to have the paradoxical effect of increased livestock predation and complaints of human @-@ puma conflicts
in a <year> study the most important predictor of puma problems were remedial hunting of puma the previous year
each additional puma on the landscape increased predation and human @-@ puma complaints by <num> but each additional animal killed on the landscape the previous year increased complaints by <num> an order of magnitude higher
the effect had a dose @-@ response relationship with very heavy <num> removal of adult puma remedial hunting leading to a <num> – <num> increase in livestock and human conflicts
this effect is attributed to the fact that inexperienced younger male pumas are most likely to approach human developments whereas remedial hunting removes older pumas who have learned to avoid people in their established territories
remedial hunting enables younger males to enter the former territories of the older animals
concolor couguar
due to the expanding human population cougar ranges increasingly overlap with areas inhabited by humans
attacks on humans are very rare as cougar prey recognition is a learned behavior and they do not generally recognize humans as prey
attacks on people livestock and pets may occur when a puma habituates to humans or is in a condition of severe starvation
attacks are most frequent during late spring and summer when juvenile cougars leave their mothers and search for new territory
between <year> and <year> in north america there were <num> reported confirmed attacks on humans resulting in <num> nonfatal injuries and <num> deaths of humans the total is greater than <num> because some attacks had more than one victim
by <year> the count had climbed to <num> attacks and <num> deaths
within north america the distribution of attacks is not uniform
the heavily populated state of california has seen a dozen attacks since <year> after just three from <year> to <year> including three fatalities
lightly populated new mexico reported an attack in <year> the first there since <year>
as with many predators a cougar may attack if cornered if a fleeing human stimulates their instinct to chase or if a person plays dead
standing still may cause the cougar to consider a person easy prey
exaggerating the threat to the animal through intense eye contact loud shouting and any other action to appear larger and more menacing may make the animal retreat
fighting back with sticks and rocks or even bare hands is often effective in persuading an attacking cougar to disengage
when cougars do attack they usually employ their characteristic neck bite attempting to position their teeth between the vertebrae and into the spinal cord
neck head and spinal injuries are common and sometimes fatal
children are at greatest risk of attack and least likely to survive an encounter
detailed research into attacks prior to <year> showed that <num> of all victims – and almost all fatalities – were children
the same study showed the highest proportion of attacks to have occurred in british columbia particularly on vancouver island where cougar populations are especially dense
preceding attacks on humans cougars display aberrant behavior such as activity during daylight hours a lack of fear of humans and stalking humans
there have sometimes been incidents of pet cougars mauling people
research on new wildlife collars may be able to reduce human @-@ animal conflicts by predicting when and where predatory animals hunt
this can not only save human lives and the lives of their pets and livestock but also save these large predatory mammals that are important to the balance of ecosystems
concolor cabrerae called the argentine cougar by north americans is noted for its extreme unwillingness to attack humans
according to the anglo @-@ argentine naturalist william henry hudson it does not attack man and azara is perfectly correct when he affirms that it never hurts or threatens to hurt man or child even when it finds them sleeping
this however is not a full statement of the facts the puma will not even defend itself against man
and all who have killed or witnessed the killing of the puma — and i have questioned scores of hunters on this point — agree that it resigns itself in this unresisting pathetic manner to death at the hands of man
claudio gay in his natural history of chili says when attacked by man its energy and daring at once forsake it and it becomes a weak inoffensive animal and trembling and uttering piteous moans and shedding abundant tears it seems to implore compassion from a generous enemy
hudson adds that except in relation to man the puma is a ferocious animal attacking even the much stronger jaguar
it is a short two @-@ lane back road that does not pass through any major populated areas and serves primarily as a connector between ny <num> and ny <num>
ny <num> also allows for faster passage from interstate <num> i @-@ <num> to the putnam lake area via ny <num>
the route was originally designated as ny <num> during the <num> and later became part of ny <num>
ny <num> was established on january <num> <year> following the truncation of ny <num> to its current eastern terminus
it crosses under the metro north tracks three times including two one @-@ lane underpasses with limited sight to the other side
it passes along the northern base of a small mountain and turns slightly southward
the highway turns due eastward and intersects with county route <num> in the hamlet of towners
just to the north is mandel pond and the route makes a series of erratic turns around small mountains passing south of cornwall hill as it does so
ny <num> turns south @-@ southeast and ends at ny <num> in patterson east of the east branch croton river
when the ny <num> designation was shifted south to its current location in the town of southeast c
<year> its former routing in patterson became part of an extended ny <num> which connected with its current routing by way of modern ny <num> ny <num> and ny <num>
ny <num> was truncated to its current length on january <num> <year>
the portion of its former alignment between ny <num> and ny <num> was then redesignated as ny <num>
the sorraia is known for its primitive features including a convex profile and dun coloring with primitive markings
concerning its origins a theory has been advanced by some authors that the sorraia is a descendant of primitive horses belonging to the naturally occurring wild fauna of southern iberia
studies are currently ongoing to discover the relationship between the sorraia and various wild horse types as well as its relationship with other breeds from the iberian peninsula and northern africa
members of the breed are small but hardy and well @-@ adapted to harsh conditions
they were occasionally captured and used by native farmers for centuries and a remnant population of these nearly extinct horses was discovered by a portuguese zoologist in the early <num> century
today the sorraia has become the focus of preservation efforts with european scientists leading the way and enthusiasts from several countries forming projects and establishing herds to assist in the re @-@ establishment of this breed from its current endangered status
<num> and <num>
<num> hands <num> and <num> inches <num> and <num> cm high although some individuals are as small as <num>
<num> hands <num> inches <num> cm the head tends to be large the profile convex and the ears long
the neck is slender and long the withers high and the croup slightly sloping
the legs are strong with long pasterns and well @-@ proportioned hooves
these horses have good endurance and are easy keepers thriving on relatively little fodder
they have a reputation for being independent of temperament but tractable
on adult horses the lay of the hair can create the appearance of stripes or barring on the neck and chest
also due to the lay of the hair newborn foals can appear to have stripes all over reminiscent of zebra stripes
the breed standard refers to this as hair stroke
dun coloring includes primitive markings such as a black dorsal stripe black tipped ears horizontal striping on the legs and a dark muzzle area
the dark muzzle area is in contrast to some other dun @-@ colored horse breeds who have light @-@ colored muzzle areas and underbellies possibly due to the presence of pangare genetics
sorraia horses have bi @-@ colored manes and tails with lighter colored hairs that fringe the outside of the longer growing black hair
this is a characteristic shared with other predominantly dun @-@ colored breeds such as the fjord horse
purebred sorraia occasionally have white markings although they are rare and undesired by the breed 's studbook
the sorraia originally developed in the southern part of the iberian peninsula
d 'andrade hypothesized that the sorraia would be the ancestor of the southern iberian breeds
morphologically scientists place the sorraia as closely related to the gallego and the asturcon but genetic studies using mitochondrial dna show that the sorraia forms a cluster that is largely separated from most iberian breeds
some evidence links this cluster with konik and domestic mongolian horses
at the same time one of the maternal lineages is shared with the lusitano
genetic evidence has not supported an hypothesis that the sorraia is related to the barb horse an african breed introduced to iberia by the moors
multiple authors have suggested that the sorraia might be a descendant of the tarpan based on shared morphological features principally the typical color of its coat
other authors simply state that the sorraia has evident primitive characteristics although they do not refer to a specific ancestor
however there have been no genetic studies comparing the sorraia with the tarpan and similarity of external morphology is an unreliable measure of relatedness
genetic studies to date have been inconclusive about the closest relative of the sorraia
on one hand studies using mitochondrial dna showed a relationship with the przewalski 's horse in that przewalski 's horse has a unique haplotype a2 not found in domestic horses which differs by just one single nucleotide from one of the major sorraia haplotypes jso41 later a7
in comparison genetic distances within the domestic horse are as large as <num> nucleotide differences
however this relationship with the przewalski 's horse was contradicted in another study using microsatellite data that showed that the genetic distance between the prewalski 's horse and the sorraia was the largest
such conflicting results can arise when a population passes through a genetic bottleneck and evidence suggests that the sorraia among other rare breeds has recently passed through a bottleneck effectively obscuring the position of this breed in the family tree of the domestic horse
thus the morphological physiological and cultural characteristics of the sorraia are the subject of continued study to better understand the relationship between various iberian horse breeds and wild horse subspecies
despite the lack of documentation attempts have been made to reconstruct its history
paleolithic parietal art images in the region depict equines with a distinct likeness to the sorraia with similar zebra @-@ like markings
analysis of mtdna has been performed on mustangs in the western united states that show similar mtdna patterns between some mustangs and the sorraia breed
spanish conquistadors took iberian horses some of whom closely resembled the modern @-@ day sorraia to the americas in their conquests probably as pack animals
similarities between the sorraia and several north and south american breeds are shown in the dun and grullo coloring and various physical characteristics
this evidence suggests that the sorraia their ancestors or other horses with similar features may have had a long history in the iberian region and a role in the creation of american breeds
otherwise the sorraia breed was lost to history until <year> when portuguese zoologist and paleontologist dr
ruy d 'andrade first encountered the sorraia horse during a hunting trip in the portuguese lowlands
this remnant herd of primitive horses had continued to live a wild existence in these lowlands which were rather inaccessible and had been used as a hunting preserve by portuguese royalty until the early <num>
at the time of d 'andrade 's initial meeting the breed the horses were ill @-@ regarded by native farmers although they were considered hardy native fauna that lived off of the uncultivated lands and salt marshes in the local river valleys
for centuries peasant farmers of the area would occasionally capture the horses and use them for agricultural work including threshing grain and herding bulls
in the <num> and <num> as mechanization became more prevalent both wild and domesticated breeding stock diminished to almost nothing and d 'andrade along with his son fernando encouraged the conservation of the breed
in <year> d 'andrade began a small herd of his own with five stallions and seven mares from horses obtained near coruche portugal
all sorraias currently in captivity descend from these original horses obtained by d 'andrade and it is believed that the remnant wild herds of the breed died out soon after
these horses were kept in a habitat similar to their native one
in <year> two other farms took up the sorraia 's cause and acquired small herds to help with conservation
in <year> three stallions and three mares were imported to germany from portugal to begin a sub @-@ population there
in march <year> a small breeding herd of sorraia horses was released on the estate of a private land owner who dedicated a portion of his property so that these horses could live completely wild as did their ancestors
the refuge created for them is in the vale de zebro region of south western portugal one of places so named because this is where the sorraia 's predecessors dwelt
two sorraia stallions were imported to the united states in the early 21st century
in <year> another sorraia stallion was imported to canada where a sorraia mustang preserve has been established on manitoulin island in ontario
unrelated to existing preservation efforts which work in conjunction with the sorraia mustang studbook another project by a consortium of breeders in the united states is attempting to establish a separate network and studbook
these breeders have gathered spanish mustangs that through mtdna testing show a genetic relationship with the sorraia and are breeding them according to both genotype and phenotype in an attempt to help preserve what they are calling the american sorraia
today the breed is nearly extinct with fewer than <num> horses existing as of <year> including around <num> breeding mares
the food and agriculture organization considers it to be maintaining critical risk status
the first studbook was published in <year> dedicated to maintaining a written record of the bloodlines of the sorraia
sorraias are present mainly in portugal with a small population in germany
while not bred for a specific use the sorraia horses are versatile and have been used in herding bulls dressage riding and light harness
ruy d 'andrade gave the breed their name of sorraia
d 'andrade took the name from the sorraia river in portugal
the breed had previously been known by the local portuguese as zebro or zebra due to their markings

the game is the stand @-@ alone sequel to defense of the ancients dota a mod for the <year> video game warcraft iii reign of chaos and its expansion pack the frozen throne
dota <num> was released for microsoft windows os x and linux in july <year> following a windows @-@ only public beta testing phase that began in <year>
dota <num> is one of the most actively played games on steam with peaks of over a million concurrent players and was praised by critics for its gameplay production quality and faithfulness to its predecessor despite being criticized for its steep learning curve
dota <num> is played in matches between two five @-@ player teams each of which occupies a base in a corner of the playing field
each player controls one of <num> playable characters called heroes that feature unique abilities and styles of play
during a match the player collects gold items and experience points for their hero while fighting heroes of the opposite team
a team wins by being the first to destroy the other side 's ancient building located within the opposing base
development of dota <num> began in <year> when icefrog lead designer of the original defense of the ancients mod was hired by valve for the same role
dota <num> initially used the original source game engine until it was ported over to source <num> in september <year> making it the first game to use it
the game also allows for the community to create custom game modes maps and cosmetics for the heroes which are then uploaded to the steam workshop
the popularity of dota <num> has led to official merchandise being produced for it including apparel accessories toys and promotional tie @-@ ins to other games and media
dota <num> has a widespread and active esports scene with teams from across the world playing in various leagues and tournaments
premium dota <num> tournaments often have prize pools totaling millions of dollars the highest of any esport
the largest of them is known as the international which is hosted by valve and takes place annually at the keyarena in seattle
starting in <year> valve also began sponsoring smaller but seasonally held tournaments known as the majors the first of which was held in frankfurt germany
dedicated media coverage of professional tournaments are broadcast live on the internet and sometimes on television networks with peak viewership numbers in the millions
two five @-@ player teams referred to as the radiant and dire compete in matches on a single asymmetrical playing field
each player commands one of the <num> characters called heroes which each feature unique abilities design and styles of play
at the start of a match each hero has an experience level of one
during the game they level up and become more powerful by accumulating experience points through combat
whenever a hero gains a level the player is able to unlock a new ability for them improve one already learned or increase their base attributes
each hero 's method of combat is influenced by its primary attribute strength intelligence agility which also affects the hero 's health points hp mana points mp and attack speed respectively
if a hero runs out of health points and dies a timer begins to count down until they are able to respawn and get back into the game
a hero also loses a portion of their unspent gold each time they die
the radiant and dire occupy bases in opposite corners of the playing field divided by a crossable river
within each base is a critical building called the ancient along with a fountain that respawns and heals that side 's heroes
a match ends when one side breaches the enemy team 's base and destroys the ancient within
the two bases are connected by three paths referred to as lanes which are guarded by defensive towers and computer @-@ controlled creatures called creeps
these creatures periodically spawn in groups and travel along the lanes to attack any enemy heroes creeps and buildings in sight
creeps spawn from two buildings called the barracks that exist in each lane and are located in the base
destroying all six of the enemy team 's barracks allows for stronger creeps for the attacking side to spawn with significantly enhanced health and damage known as mega creeps
also present are neutral creeps that are hostile to both radiant and dire side and reside in marked locations on the map known as camps
camps are located in the area between the lanes known as the jungle which both sides of the map have
neutral creeps do not attack unless provoked and will respawn if killed
the most powerful neutral creep is named roshan who is a unique boss that may be killed by either side to obtain an item that allows a one @-@ time resurrection by the hero that holds it
roshan will respawn between <num> – <num> minutes after being killed and becomes progressively harder to kill as the match continues over time
gold is primarily obtained by killing enemy heroes destroying enemy structures and killing creeps the latter act being called farming
only the hero that lands the killing blow on a creep obtains gold from it an act called last hitting but all nearby allies receive gold when an enemy hero dies
players are also able to deny allied units and structures by destroying them which then prevents their opponents from getting full experience
gold is then spent on items that provide unique active and passive abilities in addition to attribute enhancements to their wearer depending on the item
the player also receives a small continuous stream of gold over the course of a match
dota <num> often features seasonal events that present players with themed game modes which do not follow the game 's standard rules including the halloween @-@ themed diretide event the christmas @-@ themed frostivus event and the new bloom festival which celebrated the coming of spring
in october <year> a halloween @-@ themed capture point game mode was released titled colosseum
the move to the source <num> engine in <year> also saw the addition of community @-@ created custom game modes with the more popular ones having dedicated server hosting by valve
in march <year> valve introduced the custom game pass option to custom game modes which allows content creators to add exclusive features content and other changes to their game mode for a fee
an expansion pack for warcraft iii entitled the frozen throne was released later that year and a series of defense of the ancients clone mods for the new game competed for popularity
dota allstars by steve feak was the most successful and feak with his friend steve mescon created the official defense of the ancients community website and the holding company dota @-@ allstars llc
when feak retired from dota allstars in <year> a friend under the pseudonym icefrog became its lead designer
the popularity of defense of the ancients increased significantly it became one of the most popular mods in the world and by <year> a prominent esports title
icefrog and mescon later had a falling out in may <year> which prompted the former to establish a new community website at playdota
com
valve 's interest in the defense of the ancients property began when several veteran employees including team fortress designer robin walker became fans of the mod and attempted to play it competitively
the company corresponded with icefrog by email about his long @-@ term plans for the project which culminated with his being hired to direct a sequel
icefrog first announced his new position through his blog in october <year> and dota <num> was unveiled by game informer on october <num> <year>
the resultant surge of traffic crashed game informer 's servers
valve adopted the word dota derived from the original mod 's acronym as the name for its newly acquired franchise
producer erik johnson argued that the word referred to a concept and was not an acronym
shortly after the announcement of dota <num> valve filed a trademark claim to the dota name
at gamescom <year> company head gabe newell explained that the trademark was needed to develop a sequel with the already @-@ identifiable brand
holding the dota name to be a community asset feak and mescon filed an opposing trademark for dota on behalf of dota @-@ allstars llc then a subsidiary of riot games in august <year>
rob pardo the executive vice president of blizzard entertainment similarly stated that the dota name belonged to the mod 's community
blizzard acquired dota @-@ allstars llc from riot games and filed an opposition against valve in november <year> citing blizzard 's ownership of both the warcraft iii world editor and dota @-@ allstars llc as proper claims to the franchise
the dispute was settled in may <year> valve retained commercial franchising rights to the dota brand but non @-@ commercial use of the name by third @-@ parties was allowed
an early goal of the dota <num> team was the adaptation of dota 's aesthetic style for the source engine
the radiant and dire factions replaced the sentinel and scourge from the mod respectively
the appearances of each side 's heroes were adjusted to be more individualized with less traits specific to either faction
character names abilities items and map design from defense of the ancients were largely retained with some changes due to copyright issues
in the first q a session regarding dota <num> icefrog explained that the game would build upon the mod without making significant changes to its core
valve contracted major contributors from the defense of the ancients community including eul and artist kendrick lim to assist with the sequel
additional contributions from sources outside of valve were also sought regularly for dota <num> as to continue defense of the ancients 's tradition of community @-@ sourced development
one of the composers of warcraft iii reign of chaos jason hayes was hired to collaborate with tim larkin in the creation of the soundtrack
valve had half @-@ life series writer marc laidlaw science fiction author ted kosmatka and steam support employee kris katz write new dialog and background lore for the heroes
in addition to that valve also had all of the heroes voice acting completely redone
notable voice actors for the english version include nolan north dave fennoy jon st
john ellen mclain fred tatasciore merle dandridge jen taylor and john patrick lowrie among various others
the source engine itself was updated with new features to accommodate dota <num> such as high @-@ end cloth modeling and improved global lighting
the game features steam integration which provides its social component and cloud storage for personal settings
in november <year> valve introduced a coaching system which allows experienced players to tutor newer players with special in @-@ game tools
as with previous valve multiplayer titles players are able to spectate live matches of dota <num> played by others and local area network lan multiplayer support allows for local competitions
some of these events may be spectated via the purchase of tickets from the dota store which give players in @-@ game access to both live and completed matches
ticket fees are apportioned in part to tournament organizers
in an upcoming update dota <num> will support spectating a game in virtual reality vr powered by steamvr
dota <num> includes a matchmaking system which is measured by a numerical value known as matchmaking rating mmr
mmr is updated based on if a player 's team won or lost which will then increase or decrease respectively
the game 's servers known as the game coordinator attempts to balance both teams based on each player 's mmr with each team having roughly a <num> chance to win in any given game
ranked game modes with a separately tracked mmr also exist which differ from unranked games by making mmr publicly visible encouraging players who want to play in a more competitive environment among other changes
the game also includes a report system which allows for players to discourage and punish player behavior that intentionally provides a negative experience
other features include an improved replay system from defense of the ancients in which a completed game can be downloaded in @-@ client and viewed at a later time and the hero builds feature which provide integrated guides created by the community that highlight to the player on what items should be bought on their hero and which abilities to level up
as part of a plan to develop dota <num> into a social network newell announced in april <year> that the game would be free @-@ to @-@ play and that community contributions would be a cornerstone feature
that june the dota <num> team confirmed that the full roster of heroes and items would remain available without charge
instead revenue is generated through the dota store which offers for @-@ purchase exclusively cosmetic virtual goods including custom clothing and weapons for their heroes along with music packs by notable artists such as electronic music artist deadmau5 taiwanese songwriter jj lin and video game composers chance thomas jeremy soule and lennie moore
until the game 's official release in <year> players were able to purchase an early access bundle which included a digital copy of dota <num> and several cosmetic items
included as optional downloadable content dlc the dota <num> workshop tools are a set of source <num> software development kit sdk tools that allow content creators to create new cosmetics for the heroes themselves as well as custom game modes and maps
highly rated cosmetics through the steam workshop are available in the in @-@ game store if they are accepted by valve
this model was fashioned after that of valve 's team fortress <num> which had earned workshop designers of cosmetic items of that game over <num>
<num> million by june <year>
in january <year> newell revealed that the average steam workshop contributor for dota <num> and team fortess <num> made approximately <num> @,@ <num> from their creations the previous year
in <year> sales of dota <num> cosmetics had earned valve over <num> million in revenue according to the digital game market research group superdata
valve documented the lives and stories of three professional players at the first international singaporean benedict hyhy lim ukrainian danil dendi ishutin and american clinton fear loomis
in august <year> gametrailers announced that valve was developing this material into a documentary film
throughout june <year> valve conducted private screenings of the film with small groups outside the company
when an invitation was leaked by kotaku valve 's vice president of marketing doug lombardi confirmed that the documentary was in development and revealed its name as free to play
the documentary was released on march <num> <year> and was distributed for free through outlets including steam itunes and youtube
to coincide with the event valve began sending out closed beta invitations the first few invites were sent out shortly after gamescom
during the event newell speculated that dota <num> would likely ship in <year> despite original plans for a full release in late <year>
in september <year> valve scrapped its previous development and release plans which would have kept the game in its closed beta phase for over a year
the new plans which icefrog revealed via an online announcement were to begin beta testing as soon as possible and to implement the remaining heroes afterward
simultaneously valve announced that the non @-@ disclosure agreement for the beta was being lifted allowing testers to discuss the game and their experiences publicly
after nearly two years of beta testing dota <num> was officially released on steam for microsoft windows on july <num> <year> and later for os x and linux on july <num> <year>
two months following the game 's release newell claimed that updates to dota <num> generated up to three percent of global internet traffic
in december <year> the final restrictions against unlimited global access to dota <num> were lifted after the game 's infrastructure and servers were substantially bolstered
in march <year> a large update fixed many long @-@ standing bugs and issues with the game while also adding many community requested features
in order to abide by the standards set by the economic legislation of specific countries valve opted to contract with nationally @-@ based developers for publishing
in october <year> the leading beijing @-@ based video game publisher perfect world announced the acquisition of the exclusive rights of dota <num> in china
the chinese version also has a region @-@ specific low violence mode which censors and changes most depictions of blood gore and skulls in order for the game to follow censorship policies of the country
in november <year> a similar publishing deal was made with the tokyo @-@ based company nexon to distribute and market the game in south korea and japan
in november <year> nexon announced they would no longer be operating servers for dota <num> allowing valve to take over direct distribution and marketing of the game those regions
tie @-@ ins to other video games and media have also been added to dota <num> since release including custom half @-@ life <num> bastion portal trine the stanley parable rick and morty and fallout <num> announcer packs which replace the game 's default announcer with themed ones based on those series

on september <num> <year> reborn was officially released out of beta which included a new user interface framework design ability for custom game modes created by the community and the full replacement of the original source engine with source <num> making dota <num> the first game to use it
largely attributed to technical difficulties players experienced with the update the global player base experienced a sharp drop of approximately sixteen percent the month following the release of reborn
however after various updates and patches over a million concurrent players were playing again in january <year> with that being the largest amount of users since march <year>
the move to source <num> also allowed the use of the vulkan graphics api which was released as an opt @-@ in feature in may <year> becoming one of the first games to offer it
the international became an annual championship tournament in <year> with the venue changing to seattle washington
in its third year the international allowed crowdfunding to add to its prize pool through an interactive in @-@ game item called a compendium
compendiums which are optional and must be purchased separately allow players who buy them to directly raise prize money for the international by spending money on unique compendium cosmetics and other in @-@ game items with <num> of all the revenue made going directly to the prize pool
sales from the <year> compendium helped raise over <num>
<num> million making the international <year> reclaim its previous title as having the largest prize pool in esports history from the league of legends season <num> world championship
since then each annual tournament of the international has broken the previous one 's prize pool record with the fourth iteration of the tournament raising over <num>

intended as a spiritual sequel to love 's digital a love story the game was developed over the course of a month and was released as a free download on april <num> <year>
don 't take it personally is a visual novel with the majority of the plot taking place outside of the player 's control except for key decisions
it follows a new high school literature teacher in <year> over the course of a semester with the ability to see private messages between students at any time without their knowledge
it deals with themes of privacy and relationships in the future
the game was received positively with critics praising the interplay between the metafictional elements of the story and those of the game itself with special acknowledgment reserved for the writing
the player 's viewpoint follows one character the teacher in a school with the player seeing his thoughts as well as his and the other characters statements
the player advances the conversations the teacher is in or witnesses at will but cannot go backwards and has little control over what any of the characters including the teacher are saying except at a few key moments
at these points the player is presented with two or three choices for what the teacher says which option is chosen can change what path the plot takes in either a minor or major way
in a departure from most visual novels the player can also see at any time the equivalent of texts and facebook postings between the students on a school social network called amieconnect often shortened to amie as well as conversation threads on a 4chan @-@ like imageboard that serve as foreshadowing for future plot points
these extra conversations take place in parallel to in @-@ person conversations between characters occasionally at the same time the player is notified anytime a new text message or post is made
a single playthrough of the game takes over an hour
the player follows a new <num> @-@ grade literature teacher at the school john rook who has recently had his second divorce and is undergoing in his words a bizarre midlife crisis that has led him to quit his career in computers and become a teacher
the students in his class are arianna belle @-@ essai kendall flowers taylor gibson charlotte grewal isabella hart nolan striukas and akira yamazaki
rook and all of the students have school @-@ issued computers which the students use to communicate between each other in private and public messages
rook and therefore the player can see all of the messages that the students send even the private ones the school administration has told rook that it is for monitoring online bullying and that he is not to let anyone know that he can see students private messages
arianna develops a crush on the teacher which in the player 's first decision point rook can reciprocate or not
akira soon comes out as gay finding to his dismay that everyone else already knew
he then attempts to enter into a relationship with nolan who is unsure how to respond rook can encourage him to try it out or let him decide on his own but he enters a relationship with akira regardless
the next day isabella misses a meeting she set up with rook and does not return to the class
through amie texts and wall posts the other students insinuate that she committed suicide while the school is unable to provide rook with any contact information for her
class continues without her and a little while later arianna if the player rejected her earlier in the game makes another attempt to have a relationship with rook
the player may choose to accept or reject her again
through amie rook learns that both charlotte and kendall wish to resume their relationship and can influence charlotte to try again or not which changes whether or not they get back together
taylor jealously and unsuccessfully tries to drive a wedge between nolan and akira
as the end of term approaches rook begins getting strange emails about isabella 's death and begins seeing shinigami figures
upset by these occurrences when akira 's mother asks to speak to him concerning misuses of amie he assumes that she has found out that he is spying on the students conversations
when he meets her he finds that isabella is alive and had simply moved away the students made it look like she was dead via amie as a prank that got out of control
furthermore they already knew that he could see their messages akira 's mother explains that the students have no idea of online privacy having always had technology like amie and assumed that anything they put online might be read by anyone
the game ends with rook having a casual lunch with the students a date with arianna or neither depending on the choices made during the game by the player
it was written and developed by christine love with artwork made for the game by auro @-@ cyanide artwork licensed from tokudaya and kimagure after and with music licensed from rengoku teien and propanmode
it was created using the ren 'py engine
it was love 's longest game to date and her first attempt at a game with a branching storyline
it was intended as a spiritual sequel of sorts to digital a love story a <year> game by love
the game was made for nanoreno national ren 'ai game writing month a month @-@ long contest in the vein of national novel writing month nanowrimo where developers attempt to create a visual novel in one month
love 's favorite character to write was kendall
pete davidson of gamepro noted the game as an example of the creativity missing in many large @-@ budget titles and praised the story calling love a writer first and a game developer second
alec meer of rock paper shotgun described the game as a game about love sex and the internet that was capable of being profoundly moving and was about what it is to feel like someone ’ s kicked me straight in the heart
he praised love 's ability to use dialogue to effect an emotional response though he noted that the game seemed to lose some of its impact in the final chapters and felt that the use of the 12chan threads as a greek chorus was perhaps a meta @-@ layer too far
aaron poppleton of popmatters called the game a meditation on privacy in the modern age and one of the more thoughtful games to come out in a long time
he criticized the art direction of the game saying that the limitation of creating the game in a month led to poor artwork and an unpolished presentation that lets down the possibilities of the story
he did note that the story and writing of the game made the downsides of the game almost entirely a moot point and that it is a very strong game
pete davidson of pc world in an article about the treatment of sexuality in video games called out the game as an example of a game that used sexual themes maturely to explore love and relationships
emily short of gamasutra in a discussion about the game said that it was definitely worth playing and full of charming characters colorful dialogue and important questions but criticized the uneven exploration of issues regarding privacy versus personal boundaries
she said that the game 's lack of focus on rook 's issues with personal and professional boundaries was a weakness in the story given that the distinction between boundaries and privacy was crucial to the plot
love collated common criticisms and reviews of the game on her blog summarizing that while it was less praised than digital a love story most players seemed to like the way she wrote the relationships and overall story though her portrayal of rook was weak and that many players seemed to miss that he was intended to be an absolutely awful teacher and that the potential relationship with arianna was intended to be creepy and make the player feel bad
she also noted that her use of licensed artwork was detracting from the game 's potential in comparison to the reaction to the custom works
the daily telegraph gave the visual novel the award for best script in its video game awards of <year> stating that love 's layered narrative of a high school teacher embroiled in his student ’ s worries goes places most mainstream video games wouldn 't dare
it centers on a fringe investigation of a massive dynamic employee who after believing himself to be under attack by a swarm of sharp @-@ winged butterflies jumps out of a window
meanwhile olivia anna torv continues her visions of the deceased john scott mark valley and discovers how he related to a deadly psychoactive drug synthesized by massive dynamic
the dreamscape was written by series staff writers julia cho and zack whedon and was directed by fred toye
to create the opening scene they relied entirely on actor performance with guest actor ptolemy slocum simulating being cut freezing for the crew to apply prosthetic make @-@ up and then unfreezing to continue shooting the scene
vfx coordinator christopher stollard wished the computer generated butterflies to look as realistic as possible and modeled them after mounted butterfly specimens his team studied
the episode first aired in the united states on november <num> <year> on the fox network
it was watched by an estimated <num>
<num> million viewers and earned a <num>
<num> <num> ratings share among adults aged <num> to <num>
reviews of the episode were mixed with one reviewer believing it certainly moves the series in the right direction
when he is done and the other attendees have left he sees an unusual butterfly
upon picking it up he experiences a cut on his hand and is then attacked by a swarm
mark jumps out of a window to his death
olivia dunham anna torv despite preparing to go out to dinner with her sister instead agrees to phillip broyles lance reddick demand that she join the fringe team 's investigation at the scene
while examining the body dr
walter bishop john noble sees lacerations on young ’ s skin and notes a lack of corresponding tears on his shirt
at the scene olivia has a brief vision of her deceased lover john scott mark valley watching them which troubles her
later in the lab at harvard walter 's autopsy reveals a synthetic compound in mark 's blood though any link to the cuts is not yet known to them
olivia receives an email from someone who claims to be john scott listing an address for her to visit
upon arriving she finds boxes one of which contains a group of toads
at the lab walter finds that the toads contain a psychoactive compound a hallucinogen that affects the fear center of the brain
they conclude that mark ’ s brain was so convinced of something happening to his body that actual physical marks appeared
mark was infected with a large dosage leading them to attribute his death to murder
olivia admits to walter how she found the address and learns that her brain still contains some of john 's memories
wishing to discover what else john knew and prevent any further visions from occurring olivia insists on returning to walter ’ s sensory deprivation tank
inside the tank olivia sees a memory of john in a restaurant
despite walter 's vehement protest that it is impossible olivia is convinced that john scott saw her
afterwards she sees john meeting with mark and two other unidentified men
after mark and another man leave john kills the other man
olivia believes the group were looking to sell the compound as a street drug and is able to track down the other man george morales yul vazquez
once apprehended he denies killing mark and demands immunity and protection from massive dynamic who he believes was responsible for mark 's death as well as other recent fringe events
olivia confronts nina sharp blair brown about her suspicions but george is murdered before he can be of further help to them
later that night olivia gets another email from john scott simply saying i saw you
in the restaurant
meanwhile peter joshua jackson is contacted by tess susan misner a woman from his past who warns him to leave boston
when he meets her peter intuits that she is being abused by her boyfriend michael david vadim
he ambushes michael and warns him not to touch tess again
michael then informs local crime boss worth tom riis farrell that peter is back in town
it was whedon 's first contribution to the series and cho 's second
in an interview fifteen days before the broadcast of the dreamscape showrunner and executive producer jeff pinkner stated that it and several surrounding episodes would be stand @-@ alone in quality but at the same time we will start to peel back another layer of the onion to transition the second half of the season into a new chapter
anna torv later commented that she wished for olivia to lighten up during the first season but every time she did something would happen
the writers inputted small scenes to shine more light on her character which included olivia dressing up for a night out but then the phone rings
it ’ s broyles and she wipes the lipstick off puts on a coat and goes out
that ’ s it
you ’ re on call
she breaks my heart
fred toye served as the episode director his second after directing the ghost network six installments earlier
to create the opening scene of character mark young being attacked by butterflies toye shot it in multiple phases
series co @-@ creator roberto orci preferred the opening scene to involve a more subtle death so young was made to die from falling out a window which was a real thing something that 's not imagined or whimsical
vfx coordinator christopher stollard stated that his crew relied entirely on actor performance with guest actor ptolemy slocum communicating often with the crew during filming
he shot his scenes in short bursts
slocum summarized that he would experience the butterfly cut and then we would freeze apply make @-@ up to create the cut on his skin and then unfreeze and move on filming
on his first day slocum stated that he wore more than <num> individual prosthetics over his entire chest and arms
stollard wished the butterflies to be as realistic as possible and modeled them after mounted butterfly specimens his team studied
the butterflies were computer generated animations and added later in post @-@ production
to create the illusion of young falling through the window the visual effects crew placed small explosive charges on the tempered glass window slocum 's stuntman jared burke then jumped through while they triggered the glass to explode
two cameras one high and one profile were positioned to shoot the fall and were composited together later into a matte painting of the world trade building
the fall was filmed multiple times with a green screen with the stuntman falling on a cushion
while on @-@ set toye explained of the shoot with all the pieces put together with the visual effects and with the performance we got with our actor ptolemy it 's going to be fabulous
a crewman believed that the addition of music to young 's fall made the scene far more elegant and more of a statement
in a december <year> interview actress jasika nicole stated that she developed a fear of butterflies as a result of this episode
with its timeslot dominated by the dancing with the stars season finale fringe attracted an estimated <num>
<num> million viewers down from the previous week 's audience of <num>
<num> million
this placed it in third place in its timeslot behind the mentalist
the episode also came in third place among viewers aged <num> – <num> as it earned a <num>
<num> <num> ratings share this means that it was seen by <num>
<num> percent of all <num> to <num> @-@ year @-@ olds and <num> percent of all <num> to <num> @-@ year @-@ olds watching television at the time of broadcast
fringe 's marketing team designed and launched www
massivedynamic
com near the beginning of the first season
parts of the website can be seen in the dreamscape including on olivia 's computer as she researches the company
v
club was generally favorable to the episode giving it a b
he wrote much like fringe fan favorite the arrival not a favorite of mine sorry to say the dreamscape is an episode more involved with insinuation and mythology @-@ building than with telling a complete @-@ in @-@ one story
but perhaps because i 've come to trust fringe more over its recent run of entertaining episodes i enjoyed it fairly well and found myself trying to figure out what kind of thematic connections i could make using the notion of the body reacting to mere thoughts
travis fickett of ign rated the episode <num>
<num> <num> explaining that it certainly moves in the right direction
fickett found the coolest moment to be when olivia witnesses john scott 's memory and he also appreciated peter 's backstory it 's more than peter usually gets but what we know isn 't much and isn 't very exciting

fickett criticized olivia however for leaving the man at the hospital unsuitably protected
sfscope reviewer sarah stegall enjoyed peter 's sideplot and hoped to learn more of his past but thought the cute in @-@ jokes were meant to distract the audience from a thin plot full of holes
she added that the shallow cookie @-@ cutter plotting was starting to annoy her and noted that while the series had the potential to become a breakout show like the x @-@ files or lost
its major weakness is the continual reliance on the worn @-@ out cliché of the big bad corporation which had become stale and dry
jane boursaw of aol 's tv squad wrote another great episode tonight and some of the little symbols we see leading into commercials were actually in tonight 's episode referring specifically to the hallucinatory butterflies and the frogs toads found in the basement
andrew hanson of the los angeles times took notice here of the pattern of easter eggs teasing the next episode of the series
this feature of the show had earlier been touched on in an interview with showrunner jeff pinkner
as an example the previous episode the equation had contained a shot of a butterfly on a trashcan foreshadowing the hallucinated butterfly attack in this episode
in a <year> retrospective of the series a
v
club writer joshua alston considered the dreamscape as a strong example of fringe 's monster of the week episodes that predominated the first season showing how much effort and imagination went into the self @-@ contained stories
it is the title track from her third studio album true blue <year> and was released as the album 's third single on september <num> <year> by sire records

the main chorus is backed by an alternate one incorporating a chord progression generally found in doo @-@ wop music
received by the critics as a light @-@ hearted and cute retro song true blue topped the charts in uk ireland and canada and became another consecutive top ten song in u
s
for madonna by reaching number three on the billboard hot <num>
the original music video portrayed her again with a new look leaner and sporting platinum blond bushy hair
an alternate video was made through the make my video contest on mtv
the final selected videos had a similar theme of a <num> @-@ inspired setting and the storyline following the lyrics of the song
true blue has been performed on the who 's that girl world tour <year> and the rebel heart tour <year> – <num>
according to her true blue takes its title from a favourite expression of her then husband sean penn and to his very pure vision of love and was a direct tribute to him as well as the album which was as a whole inspired by her unabashed valentine for penn
in an interview bray said she madonna was very much in love
it was obvious if she 's in love she 'll write love songs
if she 's not in love she definitely won 't be writing love songs
in <year> madonna said that true blue is a song about true love
i didn 't know what i was talking about when i wrote it
true blue is a dance @-@ pop song inspired by the motown 's girl groups from the <num> which are considered the direct antecedents of madonna 's musical sound
the song is composed in the key of b major
it is set in compound quadruple meter commonly used in doo @-@ wop and has a moderate tempo of <num> beats per minute
true blue features instrumentation from a rhythm guitar a synthesizer keyboards and drums for the bassline with a basic sequence of i – vi – iv – v b – g ♯ m – e – f ♯ as its main chord progression
madonna 's vocal range spans a bit less than one and a half octaves from f ♯ <num> to b4
the chorus is backed by sounds of bells ringing an alternate verse — this time i know it 's true — which is sung by three back @-@ up singers during the interlude and a bass counter melody which introduces her vocals during the second chorus
the lyrics are constructed in a verse @-@ chorus form with the theme being madonna 's feelings for sean penn it even uses the archaic love word dear in the line just think back and remember dear
in his book madonna an intimate biography journalist j
randy taraborrelli described the song as the light @-@ hearted fun track of the whole true blue album project having a retro <year> 's feel to it
in the book rock n roll gold rush which contains information about various artists and their singles author maury dean said that the song as a masterwork of simplicity interwoven with secret complexity adding that on one hand it 's just a basic steetcorner ditty with four basic chords
in another context it 's a counterpoint harmonic blanket twirling with star @-@ spangled timbre and dynamic drive
rikky rooksby in his book the complete guide to the music of madonna said that true blue is a song that is merely cute and not really up to being the title track of an album
the wichita eagle did not like the song believing that it was sassless and neutered as compared to the other songs on the record
however daniel brogan of the chicago tribune believed the song was good calling it impressive like the rest of the album and jan deknock of the same paper believed it was charming
steve morse of the boston globe when describing the song said that it was a bid to be an <num> helen of troy
it debuted on the billboard hot <num> at number <num> six weeks later it reached its peak of number three remaining at the position for three consecutive weeks and spent a total of <num> weeks on the chart

shot in early september <year> in new york madonna 's own video for the song was directed by james foley who worked with madonna in her videos for live to tell and papa don 't preach produced by robert colesberry and david massar with photography by michael ballhaus
the foley version features madonna with three dancers and a <num> car in an all @-@ blue diner
madonna changes her hairstyle from short @-@ cropped in papa don 't preach to a bushy platinum blonde hairdo and sings the song in choreographed moves backed by her dancers
it displays a flashing back to fifties rock 'n'roll youth culture
the blue background changes to a sunny one as she sings the sun is bursting right out of the sky to go @-@ along with the lyrical meaning of the song
two of madonna 's close friends erika belle and debi mazar appear in the video
the video was released at a time when she was going through a failed marriage with then husband actor sean penn
during this period madonna focused on more traditional fashion and attitudes and tried to appear more respectful of traditional gender roles
after shedding her trampy sex @-@ kitten and boy @-@ toy image with the live to tell music video madonna again adopted a new look for this video
madonna attended aerobics classes at hollywood health centre the sports connection which was responsible for her toned down look in the video
in the fall of <year> mtv asked its viewers to submit their own videos
the contest was known as madonna 's make my video contest
the winner was awarded a trip to mtv 's new york studio where madonna presented a <num> @,@ <num> check live on mtv
thousands of viewers submitted their recorded tapes which were mainly made using home @-@ made video equipment and featured themselves or relatives as the actors
mtv publicist peter danielson said that many of the submissions featured teenagers imitating madonna
all the entries were shown in a continuous run on mtv as promised
the same song was played over and over for the whole day but each time with a different video made by the finalists
author lisa a
lewis said that this event emphasized the effect madonna had on different kind of audiences due to the popularity and response to the contest
mtv selected ten finalists based mainly on a standard of popularity rather than slickness of production or concept creativity
the concepts used in the videos were wide ranging and included a number of different ideas to interpret the lyrical meaning of the song
the final three entries selected portrayed a fifties @-@ style production referring to the thematic content of the song
the song 's narration about true love formed the basis of the rest of the semi @-@ finalist videos but was used in very different ways
the videos were choreographed featuring heterosexual romance though no particular male or female protagonist was singled out
some even adopted a kind of literal montage technique rather than structuring the video around a narrative line
the winning entry was by angel gracia and cliff guest and it showed the female protagonist played by the director 's sister anabel garcia being supported and guided by her girlfriends who introduce her with the male protagonist
the girl even goes to the boy 's door to gift him flowers thereby reversing the usual gender @-@ directed pattern of gift @-@ giving
the male protagonist is portrayed as a perfect boy played by william fitzgibbon having the sensibilities like attentiveness cuteness playfulness like a friend after the lyrics you 're my best friend and not sexual overtones
the video in @-@ turn contrasts him with a self @-@ centered boy who puts on sunglasses throws his leather jacket over his shoulder and walks away from the girl
other videos portrayed a girl pining for her sailor u
s
-soviet relations and an arguing couple with the girl in a scene inspired by the music video of tina turner 's <year> single what 's love got to do with it
she came up on the stage wearing a blue dress to sing the song after finishing a performance of lucky star
in a similar setting to the original music video of the song madonna is backed up by her singers who play her girlfriends
at the end of the song madonna is asked to dance again by the dancer playing her man in the performance
her dance in the performance and also some other performances in the tour was choreographed by jeffrey hornaday from flashdance
two different performances of the song on the tour were included on two live video releases who 's that girl live in japan filmed in tokyo japan on june <num> <year> and ciao italia live from italy filmed in turin italy on september <num> <year>
madonna did not perform the song again until <year> as part of her rebel heart tour
she performed an acoustic ukulele @-@ driven version of the song sitting on top of a tire stack while asking the crowd to sing along with her
writing for the daily news jim farber felt that during the performance madonna emphasized a rare sincerity while jordan zivitz from the montreal gazette opined that it was both endearingly quaint and supersized by an unprompted singalong from more than <num> @,@ <num> voices a goosebumps moment that felt more grandiose in its way than the showpieces surrounding it
newsday 's glenn gamboa gave a similar feedback saying that the lovely acoustic version of true blue was a rare bow to romance the sweetest of madonna sentiments
its plumage is predominantly dark slate @-@ grey and the bare skin around its eyes the long thick bill and the legs are all bright red
its call is a low drumming sound which is accompanied by wing @-@ beating
the difficulty of seeing this shy bird in its dense habitat means that information on its behaviour is limited
recorded dietary items include sago shoots and insects and it also swallows small stones to help break up its food
it is apparently monogamous but little else is known of its courtship behaviour
the only known nest was a shallow bowl in the top of a rotting tree stump that was lined with wood chips and dry leaves
the two young chicks were entirely covered in black down typical of precocial newly hatched rails
the estimated population of <num> @,@ <num> – <num> @,@ <num> birds and the restricted range mean that the invisible rail is classified as vulnerable by the international union for conservation of nature iucn
habitat loss has occurred through the harvesting of sago and conversion of the wetlands to rice cultivation and the rail is eaten by local people
the described nest was in an area frequented by local villagers so the rail may be more adaptable to habitat changes than had been thought
they are small to medium @-@ sized terrestrial or wetland birds and their short bodies are often flattened laterally to help them move through dense vegetation
island species readily become flightless of <num> extant or recently extinct taxa restricted to islands <num> have lost the ability to fly
the invisible rail first classified by english zoologist george robert gray in <year> is the only member of the monotypic genus habroptila
the genus name habroptila derives from the greek habros delicate pretty splendid and ptilon feather wing wallacii commemorates british zoologist alfred russel wallace
local names include soisa tibiales and rèie
this rail is related to the new guinea flightless rail megacrex inepta and the chestnut rail eulabeornis castaneoventris all three australasian genera probably being derived from amaurornis ancestors
storrs olson argued that the genus megacrex was so similar to habroptila that megacrex should be considered a junior synonym of habroptila resulting in two species in the genus
this was further lumped in sidney dillon ripley 's <year> monograph of the rallidae he included habroptila within the large genus rallus
this suggestion was however not accepted by gerlof fokko mees who pointed out distinct differences in the shape and structure of the bill
a molecular phylogenetic analysis based on mitochondrial dna sequence similarity found that habroptila is part of evolutionary radiation within the broad genus gallirallus that took place around <num> @,@ <num> years ago in the region
the adult has a mainly dark slate @-@ grey body dark brown plumage on the lower back rump and wings and a black uppertail
its underparts are slightly paler slate @-@ grey than the back and the bare skin around the eye the long thick bill and the strong legs are bright red
it has a small spine at the bend of the wings
the sexes are identical in appearance the plumage of fledged immature birds has not been described
the invisible rail is superficially similar to the purple swamphen porphyrio porphyrio which has recently been found in halmahera but that species is larger with a short thick red bill and a red forehead shield it also has purple underparts and a white undertail
the invisible rail is different from the calayan rail gallirallus calayanensis in that it is larger and lacks the barred plumage of that species there is no overlap between the ranges of the two species
the call is a low drumming accompanied by a tuk tuk tuk made with the wings
the nature of the vocalisation led to a local legend that the sound is made by the bird beating on a hollow tree or branch with its feet
gerd heinrich noted the local name soisa meaning drum and described the call as being a subdued drumming purre – purre – purre – purre – purre which sometimes ends in a loud shrill scream
the bird also produced a dull hum similar to the voice of the banded pig sus scrofa vittatus and reminiscent of the call of the snoring rail aramidopsis plateni
calling is most frequent in the early morning or late evening and a human tapping a sago stem with a machete may elicit a response from the bird
a quieter version of the call is given at the nest
other sounds attributed to this rail such as loud screams may be incorrect since they are like those produced by the pale @-@ vented bush @-@ hen amaurornis moluccana
claims that the rail occurs in alang @-@ alang grass are thought to have arisen from confusion with the pale @-@ vented bush @-@ hen
german ornithologist gerd heinrich who prepared for his halmahera trip by rolling in stinging nettles wrote of the sago swamp habitat in the <num> i am solidly confident no european has ever seen this rail alive for that requires such a degree of toughening and such demands on oneself as i cannot so easily attribute to others
habroptila is shielded by the awful thorns of the sago swamps
in this thorn wilderness i walked barefoot and half @-@ naked for weeks
sightings of the rail from <year> to <year> were from a restricted area of west halmahera regency at the base of the western peninsula of the island but it was recorded prior to <year> as far as the southern point of halmahera
more recent records showed that it is still present in a significantly larger area including the northeast of the island and locals claim that it also occurs in the swamps near kao in the northwest
recorded food items include sago shoots and insects
it also feeds at cut sago plants although it is unclear whether it is eating the decaying plant or searching for other edible items
it swallows small stones as do all rails to help break up its food in the gizzard
the invisible rail is thought to be monogamous but little else is known of its courtship behaviour prior to nesting
a report of <num> – <num> striped chicks was long thought to be incorrect since such a plumage is not normal for rails
in this family chicks are typically precocial downy and black with any ornamentation confined to the head bare flesh or specially modified plume feathers
the issue was resolved in november <year> when a nest was found in the top of a rotting tree stump <num> m <num> in above ground level and <num> m <num> ft in from the edge of a dry swamp forest in aketajawe @-@ lolobata national park
the nest depression was <num> cm <num>
<num> in in depth with a lower layer of small wood chips at its base and a lining of dead leaves
the egg shells were brownish @-@ white with dark brown and black markings of different sizes
the two very young chicks were entirely covered in black down contrasting with a white pollux the equivalent of the thumbnail on a human hand and pink index nail
the bill was black with a white tip and the legs were black @-@ streaked brown
the eyes had grey irises and blue pupils
rail chicks leave the nest soon after hatching so the chicks were assumed to be only a day or two old
almost a quarter of all rail species have conservation concerns and flightless island species are particularly at risk at least <num> species having become extinct since <year>
the estimated population of the invisible rail is <num> @,@ <num> – <num> @,@ <num> birds and its restricted range and small population mean that the species is classified as vulnerable by the international union for conservation of nature iucn although this rail is so poorly known that it may be more common than the estimates suggest
habitat loss has occurred through commercial harvesting of the sago or conversion to rice cultivation and fishponds
the rail is a prized food for local people who catch it with traps made from strings of bark and hunt it with dogs
the only described nest was in an area well @-@ used by local villagers and the rail may be more adaptable to habitat changes than had been thought
there were also several sightings in northeast halmahera in <year> and <year> extending the area in which this bird has been seen in recent years
the project was started in response to the church of scientology 's attempts to remove material from a highly publicized interview with scientologist tom cruise from the internet in january <year>

another referred to the group as a group of computer geeks
later the church of scientology started referring to anonymous as cyberterrorists perpetrating religious hate crimes against the church
detractors of scientology have also criticized the actions of project chanology asserting that they merely provide the church of scientology with the opportunity to play the religious persecution card
other critics such as mark bunker and tory christman initially questioned the legality of project chanology 's methods but have since spoken out in support of the project as it shifted towards nonviolent protests and other legal methods

a riff popped into chris martin 's mind late one night in liverpool when he came in to the studio where he then developed it on piano
according to martin clocks was inspired by the english rock band muse
martin presented the riff to the band 's guitarist jonny buckland who then added a layer of guitar chords to the basic track he picked up his guitar a sure sign that he likes a song and played these brilliant chords
it was like a chemical reaction process
the syncopated piano arpeggio that gives the song its signature sound also bears a similarity to a syncopated arpeggio that is repeated several times in alex de grassi 's <year> instrumental clockwork
before writing and composing clocks the band had already written <num> songs for the album
but as they thought it was too late for the song 's inclusion in the album since a rush of blood to the head was nearing completion they recorded a demo and saved it with other unfinished tracks labeling it songs for <num> the band projected these tracks for what would be their third album
by june <year> coldplay were ready to present the album to their record label parlophone
however martin felt it was rubbish they were so far from being completely satisfied with the album that both the band and parlophone delayed the release
after a headlining tour coldplay went on working songs for <num>
phil harvey a friend of martin and the band 's manager heard it and egged him on to rework clocks immediately
with lyrics that speak of urgency harvey pointed out that its meaning would contradict martin 's idea of stashing the track
thus persuaded by harvey martin then further developed clocks while other band members supplemented their ideas based on the main piano track adding bass and drums
coldplay recorded the song very quickly since they were running after the postponed schedule of a rush of blood to the head which was released two months later
martin applied an ostinato with emphasis that imitates a three against two polyrhythm as well as a descending scale on the piano chord progression which switches from major to minor chords
the music of clocks is also provided using synthesizers and a sparse string arrangement
the themes of the lyrics include contrast contradictions and urgency
according to jon wiederhon of mtv news martin seems to address the helplessness of being in a dysfunctional relationship he doesn 't necessarily want to escape
the lyrics are cryptic the ending lines of the second verse emphasize contradicting emotion come out upon my seas cursed missed opportunities am i a part of the cure or am i part of the disease the song 's title also metaphorically alludes to its lyrics pushing one to wonder about the world 's obsession with time while connecting it to the theory make the best of it when we ’ re here present and alive
the song is in the key of e flat mixolydian with a main chord progression of e ♭ b ♭ m fm
the single was issued with two b @-@ sides animals which was one of the band 's favourite songs performed on tour but was not included in the album and crests of waves
the single 's cover created by sølve sundsbø as with the album 's and its other singles is a portrayal of chris martin
across the united states while preparing the scientist as the album 's second release coldplay 's us label felt the song failed to provide enough of a blood rush for american listeners instead they released clocks as the second single in the us
a music video was filmed in support of the song
it was directed by british film maker dominic leung and shot at docklands excel building in london
it features the band performing the song with a laser show in front of a staged audience mostly local college students
stage effects and blue @-@ red light transitions give the video a surreal feel while a stoic crowd make up the audience
rob sheffield in his review of the album for rolling stone magazine said that guitarist buckland shines in excellent psychedelic rockers such as
clocks
david cheal of the daily telegraph said that clocks features a hypnotic piano riff a pounding almost frantic rhythm and a contagious tune all building to a gorgeously serene climax with martin 's floaty voice singing
scott floman music critic for goldmine magazine described the song as a stunningly pretty piano rocker absolutely perfect and is simply one of the finest songs of the decade

according to the new york times the opening piano arpeggios of clocks have been widely sampled
also many of the songs in x y feature influences from clocks
brian cohen of billboard magazine noted that clocks served as a launching pad for songs featured in x y several of which echo that track either in structure or feel
speed of sound the first single from coldplay 's third album x y is similar to clocks in that the two songs have the same descending chord progression
according to the new york times american singer jordin sparks 's <year> single no air breathes life into the overfamiliar piano line from clocks
the song should i go by american singer brandy norwood from her album afrodisiac samples the piano riff of clocks as does mexican singer alejandro fernández 's <year> single te voy a perder
in <year> french dj david guetta featuring kelly rowland released the song when love takes over which has a piano introduction like clocks

in an interview for complex wyatt said that the song is built in tsunami form stating that the real pay @-@ off does not come until the final refrain
according to critic josh modell of spin the song dips its toes in the kind of brit @-@ rock purveyed by elbow but mixes in some organic tribal fun à la yeasayer
wyatt sings with falsetto vocals which chris martins of the a
v
club thought recalled a sad @-@ faced peter gabriel
in the chorus wyatt sings my love won 't be saved we 'll all be staring at the wave
winnberg told billboard that the wave kind of sums up a lot what miike snow is about
adam markovitz of entertainment weekly named it one of the best tracks on happy to you while will salmon of clash and amber genuske of the huffington post called it a standout
exclaim s ashley hampson deemed it incredibly catchy writing that it capitalize s on the falsetto musings of vocalist andrew wyatt
andy baber of musicomh described the track as much more like the miike snow that many came to know and love
the writer praised the piano and marching drums for giving the song a sense of direction that the opener lacked
caroline sullivan writing for the guardian commented that a martial beat contrastingly languid vocals and a snaggy hookline give the wave a toothsome kick and slant magazine 's kevin liedel wrote that the beat succeeds
chris schulz of the new zealand herald said that the song alongside the album tracks paddling out and bavarian <num> say you will will swirl around in your head for days and demand repeat plays
spin 's josh modell named it a highlight of the album he wrote that if the album as a whole sounded like the wave it could fill arenas
chris martins of the a
v
club wrote though wyatt 's vocals recall a sad @-@ faced peter gabriel the song is steeped in the kind of effervescent magic that makes lykke li and peter bjorn and john stars in their own right
evan sawdey of popmatters was critical of wyatt 's vocal performance he wrote that we really get a sense of how wyatt 's voice hinders the group
he said that the singer intones the lyrics somewhat abstractly but with absolutely no sense of gravity to be found in his voice at all

in an interview for the creators project nilsson explained how the videos were conceptualized the concept of this was born after long evenings of me and the band talking about gene technology in contemporary science
we share a mutual excitement in what 's happening on the medical scene right now
the wave was filmed before paddling out although the latter was released first
wyatt explained to billboard we really liked director andreas 's images and i think they go together in a way that feels truthful with what we do
and you can read into it in different ways
the video for the wave begins with the aliens spaceship crashing to earth
the camera then hovers over a playground where dozens of children appear to be dead
several policemen arrive at the scene and begin to remove the bodies by putting them in wheelbarrows
meanwhile jean noel is seen running on a desert road
the policemen then begin to dig graves for the corpses
jean noel then spots another specimen who looks just like him and the two begin to run
they are soon joined by more specimens before arriving at the playground
by chanting at the policemen the specimens appear to mind control them into dance
jean noel continues to run and stops when he sees the crashed spaceship
the video ends with the band 's jackalope logo

djedkare succeeded menkauhor kaiu and was in turn succeeded by unas
his relations to both of these pharaohs remain uncertain although it is often conjectured that unas was djedkare 's son owing to the smooth transition between the two
djedkare likely enjoyed a long reign of over <num> years which heralded a new period in the history of the old kingdom
breaking with a tradition followed by his predecessors since the time of userkaf djedkare did not build a temple to the sun god ra possibly reflecting the rise of osiris in the egyptian pantheon
more significantly djedkare effected comprehensive reforms of the egyptian state administration the first undertaken since the inception of the system of ranking titles
he also reorganised the funerary cults of his forebears buried in the necropolis of abusir and reformed the corresponding priesthood
djedkare commissioned expeditions to sinai to procure copper and turquoise to nubia for its gold and diorite and to the fabled land of punt for its incense
one such expedition had the earliest recorded instance of oracular divination undertaken to ensure an expedition 's success
the word nub meaning gold to designate nubia is first recorded during djedkare 's reign
under his rule egypt also entertained continuing trade relations with the levantine coast and made punitive raids in canaan
in particular one of the earliest depictions of a battle or siege scene was found in the tomb of one of djedkare 's subjects
djedkare was buried in a pyramid in saqqara named nefer djedkare djedkare is perfect which is now ruined owing to theft of stone from its outer casing during antiquity
the burial chamber still held djedkare 's mummy when it was excavated in the <num>
examinations of the mummy revealed that he died in his fifties
following his death djedkare was the object of a cult that lasted at least until the end of the old kingdom
he seemed to have been held in particularly high esteem during the mid @-@ sixth dynasty whose pharaohs lavished rich offerings on his cult
archaeological evidence suggests the continuing existence of this funerary cult throughout the much later new kingdom period c
<year> – <num> bce
djedkare was also remembered by the ancient egyptians as the king of vizier ptahhotep the purported author of the maxims of ptahhotep one of the earliest pieces of philosophic wisdom literature
the reforms implemented by djedkare are generally assessed negatively in modern egyptology as his policy of decentralization created a virtual feudal system that transferred much power to the high and provincial administrations
some egyptologists such as naguib kanawati argue that this contributed heavily to the collapse of the egyptian state during the first intermediate period c
<num> years later
these conclusions are rejected by nigel strudwick who says that in spite of djedkare 's reforms ancient egyptian officials never amassed enough power to rival that of the king
the tombs of many of his courtiers and family members have been discovered in giza saqqara and abusir
they give insights into the administrative reforms that djedkare conducted during his reign and in a few cases even record letters that the king sent to his officials
these letters inscribed on the walls of tombs typically present royal praises for the tomb owner
another important source of information about egypt during the reign of djedkare isesi is the abusir papyri
these are administrative documents covering a period of <num> years during djedkare 's reign they were discovered in the mortuary temples of pharaohs neferirkare kakai neferefre and queen khentkaus ii
in addition to these texts the earliest letters on papyrus preserved to the present day also date to djedkare 's reign dealing with administrative or private matters
the earliest of these is the karnak king list dating to the reign of thutmose iii <year> – <year> bce where djedkare is mentioned on the fifth entry
djedkare 's prenomen occupies the <num> entry of the abydos king list which was written during the reign of seti i <num> – <num> bce
djedkare is also present on the saqqara tablet 31st entry where he is listed under the name maatkare probably because of a scribal error
djedkare 's prenomen is given as djed on the turin canon third column <num> row probably because of a lacuna affecting the original document from which the canon was copied during the reign of ramses ii <num> – <num> bce
the turin canon credits djedkare with <num> years of reign
in addition to these sources djedkare is mentioned on the prisse papyrus dating to the <num> dynasty c
<year> – <year> bce
the papyrus records the maxims of ptahhotep and gives djedkare 's nomen isesi to name the pharaoh whom the purported authors of the maxims vizier ptahhotep served
djedkare was also probably mentioned in the aegyptiaca a history of egypt written in the <num> century bce during the reign of ptolemy ii <num> – <num> bce by the egyptian priest manetho
no copies of the aegyptiaca have survived to this day and it is known to us only through later writings by sextus julius africanus and eusebius
africanus relates that a pharaoh tancherês ancient greek τανχέρης reigned for <num> years as the eighth and penultimate king of the fifth dynasty
given its position within the dynasty tancherês is believed to be the hellenized name of djedkare isesi
djedkare is generally thought to have been the son of menkauhor kaiu but the two might instead have been brothers and sons of nyuserre ini
another hypothesis suggests that djedkare and menkauhor could have been cousins being sons of nyuserre and neferefre respectively
the identity of djedkare 's mother is similarly unknown
an important queen consort whose name is lost was very likely the owner of a large pyramid complex located to the northeast of djedkare 's pyramid in saqqara
this could indicate that she was the mother of djedkare 's successor unas or that djedkare owed the throne to her
the very high status of this queen is suggested by some features of her funerary complex that are otherwise reserved to kings her pyramid has its own satellite pyramid has a causeway leading from a valley temple up to a mortuary temple devoted to the cult of the queen and had an entrance hall pr @-@ wrw an open courtyard and a square antechamber
furthermore some reliefs showing the queen had been reworked with royal insignia and vultures added above her head
since the construction of the queen 's pyramid was apparently undertaken after the planning of djedkare 's pyramid and her relief had been reworked the egyptologist klaus baer suggests that this queen may have ruled after the death of djedkare playing an important role in his succession
this is rejected by other egyptologists such as michel baud owing to the lack of evidence for a regency or interregnum between djedkare and unas
the egyptologist wilfried seipel has proposed that this pyramid was initially intended for queen meresankh iv whom he and verner see as a wife of djedkare
seipel contends that meresankh was finally buried in a smaller mastaba in saqqara north after she fell into disgrace
alternatively aidan dodson and dyan hilton have proposed that she was a wife of the preceding king menkauhor kaiu
neserkauhor also bore the title of iry @-@ pat showing that he was an important member of the royal court as well as a priestly title greatest of the five in the temple of thot suggesting that he may have been a vizier or had similar occupations
as well as neserkauhor there is indirect evidence that princes raemka and kaemtjenent are sons of djedkare based on the dating and general location of their tombs in saqqara
for example the tomb of kaemtjenent mentions vizier rashepses who served during the reign of djedkare
raemka also bore the title of king 's son of his body almost exclusively reserved to true princes of royal blood
the locations of raemka 's and kaemtjenent 's tombs have led some egyptologists to believe that both princes are sons of queen meresankh iv buried nearby who would thus be one of djedkare 's wives
these conclusions are debated in particular in the case of kaemtjenent whose title of king 's son may have been purely honorific
a high official named isesi @-@ ankh could have been yet another son of djedkare isesi as suggested by his name meaning isesi lives
yet similarities in the titles and locations of the tombs of isesi @-@ ankh and kaemtjenent have led egyptologists to propose that they could instead be brothers and sons of meresankh iv or that the former is a son of the latter
even though isesi @-@ ankh bore the title of king 's son the egyptologists michel baud and bettina schmitz argue that this filiation was fictitious being only an honorary title
finally the successor of djedkare unas is thought to have been his son in spite of the complete lack of evidence bearing on the question
the main argument in favor of this filiation is that the succession from djedkare isesi to unas seems to have been smooth as suggested indirectly for example by the abusir papyri
indirect evidence also comes from the reliefs of unas causeway which show many officials bearing names incorporating isesi suggesting at the very least that unas did not perceive djedkare as an antagonist
these include kekheretnebti whose filiation is clearly indicated by her other title of beloved of isesi meret @-@ isesi hedjetnebu and nebtyemneferes
less certain is the filiation of kentkhaus iii wife of vizier senedjemib mehi who bore the title of king 's daughter of his body
it is debated whether this title indicates a true filiation or if it is only honorary
the duration of djedkare 's reign is much less certain
djedkare 's time on the throne is well documented by the abusir papyri numerous royal seals and contemporary inscriptions taken together they indicate a fairly long rule for this king
while the turin canon credits him with <num> years of reign there is direct evidence for an even longer reign
several artefacts and inscriptions have been uncovered relating to djedkare 's rejuvenation or sed festival normally celebrated only after <num> years of reign
for example the tomb of one of djedkare 's viziers senedjemib inti relates construction works undertaken during the year of the <num> cattle count in preparation for the festival ceremonies
an alabaster vase now on display at the louvre museum bears an inscription celebrating djedkare 's first sed festival indicating in all likelihood that he reigned beyond his <num> year on the throne
one of the abusir papyri was found to be dated to the year of the <num> count iv akhet day <num> constituting djedkare 's latest known date
this date might correspond to any time from the <num> year of djedkare 's reign up to his <num> year on the throne depending on whether the cattle count was once every two years or once every year and a half
the higher estimate is close to manetho 's <num> @-@ year figure credited to tancherês the hellenized name of djedkare although this may just be coincidental
modern estimates thus put djedkare 's reign length as certainly more than <num> years and if the cattle count was regularly biennial at least <num> to <num> years
this makes djedkare the longest reigning king of the fifth dynasty
first djedkare isesi did not build a sun temple as his predecessors had done since the time of userkaf some <num> years earlier
this may be a result of the increased prominence of osiris compared with the sun god ra during the late fifth dynasty
the importance of this cult becomes manifest when the pyramid texts of the pyramid of unas are inscribed a few decades later
in this context it is perhaps noteworthy that the only known statue of djedkare isesi was discovered in the ruins of the temple of osiris in abydos
another manifestation of the winds of change during djedkare 's time on throne is the confirmation of the relocation of the royal necropolis from abusir where it had been since the reign of sahure to saqqara where menkauhor kaiu djedkare and his successor unas built their pyramids
abusir may have become overcrowded by the time of menkauhor 's accession and the capital may have been shifted south to saqqara along with the royal necropolis around the same time
the abandonment of abusir as a royal necropolis and the termination of sun temple building are possibly related given the close association between the two since the reign of userkaf
these evolutions are witnessed by changes in priestly titles and more broadly in the system of ranking titles of high officials which was modified for the first time in its existence
for example the priesthood of the royal pyramids was reorganized with djedkare changing the titles and functions of the priests from priest of king to priest of the pyramid
princes of royal blood could once more hold administrative titles a prerogative they had lost during the early fifth dynasty
at the same time viziers could now hold the prestigious titles of iry @-@ pat and haty @-@ a and as overseer of the royal scribes became the head of the scribal administration
at least one vizier seshemnefer iii even bore the title of king 's son of his body one of the most distinguished titles at the time and normally reserved to princes of royal blood
yet neither seshemnefer iii 's father nor his mother seems to have belonged to the royal family
for the period spanning the reign of djedkare until that of teti viziers were furthermore responsible for the weaponry of the state both for military and other purposes
following the reforms undertaken by djedkare three viziers would be in office at the same time two in the memphite region and a southern one the governor of upper egypt with a seat at abydos
in total six viziers were appointed during djedkare 's reign
lower ranking officials lost power during the late fifth dynasty and were frequently limited to holding only one high title a departure from the preceding period
such functions as overseer of the granary and overseer of the treasury disappear from the record some time between djedkare 's reign and that of teti while men of lower status became head of the legal administration
consequently the viziers concentrated more power than before while lower echelons of the state administration were reduced
at the same time the size of the provincial administration was increased and it also became more autonomous from the central government
in particular the nomarchs were responsible in their provinces for performing works hitherto conducted by memphite officials
djedkare also either completed or undertook restoration works in the funerary complex of nyuserre ini in abusir as indicated by a now damaged inscription which must have detailed djedkare 's activities on the site
further building works took place in abusir during the second half of djedkare 's reign following the curious decision by members of the royal family to be buried there rather than next to djedkare 's pyramid in saqqara
a group of mastabas was thus constructed for princess kekheretnebti and her daughter tisethor princess hedjetnebu the courtiers mernefu and idu who was buried with his wife khenit and prince neserkauhor
djedkare isesi also undertook building activities in relation with his sed festival as indicated by a decree that he sent to his vizier senedjemib inti on the year of the <num> cattle count praising him for his work
the decree mentions the construction of a broad rectangular court or artificial lake for the jubilee of the king some <num> cubits long and <num> cubits wide amounting to c
<num> m × <num> m <num> @,@ <num> ft × <num> ft
the court was located within the precincts of a palace built for the ceremonies of the sed festival which was probably located in the vicinity of his pyramid
another decree addressed to senedjemib inti and later inscribed on the walls of his mastaba records the decoration of a chapel of hathor in the palace of the king
this chapel was most likely built during his reign
djedkare may have left some of his monuments unfinished at his death as suggested by several relief @-@ bearing blocks inscribed with his name and which were found reused in the pyramid of king unas
their original setting remains unknown
these inscriptions record three expeditions sent to look for turquoise the earliest one dated to the third or fourth cattle count – possibly corresponding to the sixth or eighth year of dejdkare 's reign – explicitly recalls the arrival of the mining party to the hills of the turquoise after being given divine authority for the finding of semi @-@ precious stones in the writing of the god himself as was enacted in the broad court of the temple nekhenre
this sentence could indicate the earliest known record of an oracular divination undertaken in order to ensure the success of the expedition prior to its departure nekhenre being the sun temple of userkaf
another inscription dating to the year of the ninth cattle count – possibly djedkare 's <num> year on the throne – shows the king subduing all foreign lands
smiting the chief of the foreign land
the expedition that left this inscription comprised over <year> men and administration officials
some egyptologists have proposed that these men were also sent to mine copper
these expeditions departed egypt from the port of ain sukhna on the western shore of the gulf of suez as revealed by papyri and seals bearing djedkare isesi 's name found on the site
the port comprised large galleries carved into the sandstone serving as living quarters and storage places
the wall of one such gallery was inscribed with a text mentioning yet another expedition to the hills of turquoise in the year of the seventh cattle count – possibly djedkare 's <num> year on the throne
south of egypt djedkare dispatched at least one expedition to the diorite quarries located <num> km <num> mi north @-@ west of abu simbel
djedkare was not the first king to do so as these quarries were already exploited during the fourth dynasty and continued to be so during the sixth dynasty and later in the middle kingdom period c
<year> bce – c
<year> bce
djedkare probably also exploited gold mines in the eastern desert and in nubia indeed the earliest mention of the land of gold – an ancient egyptian term for nubia – is found in an inscription from the mortuary temple of djedkare isesi
a gold cylinder seal bearing the serekh of djedkare isesi together with the cartouche of menkauhor kaiu is now on display at the museum of fine arts boston
the seal whose gold may originate from the pactolus river valley in western anatolia could attest to wide ranging trade @-@ contacts during the later fifth dynasty but its provenance remains unverifiable
trade contacts with byblos on the coast of modern @-@ day lebanon are suggested by a fragmentary stone vessel unearthed in the city and bearing the inscription king of upper and lower egypt djedkare living forever
a biographical inscription discovered in the tomb of iny a sixth dynasty official provides further evidence for an egyptian expedition to byblos during djedkare 's reign
iny 's inscription relates his travels to procure lapis lazuli and lead or tin for pharaoh merenre but starts by recounting what must have been similar events taking place under djedkare
to the south of egypt djedkare also sent an expedition to the fabled land of punt to procure the myrrh used as incense in the egyptian temples
the expedition to punt is referred to in the letter from pepi ii neferkare to harkuf some <num> years later
harkuf had reported that he would bring back a dwarf of the god 's dancers from the land of the horizon dwellers
pepi mentions that the god 's sealbearer werdjededkhnum had returned from punt with a dwarf during the reign of djedkare isesi and had been richly rewarded
the decree mentions that my majesty will do for you something greater than what was done for the god 's sealbearer werdjededkhnum in the reign of isesi reflecting my majesty 's yearning to see this dwarf
djedkare 's expedition to punt is also mentioned in a contemporaneous graffito found in tumas a locality of lower nubia some <num> km <num> mi south of aswan where isesi 's cartouche was discovered
in particular one of the earliest known depictions of a battle or city being besieged is found in the tomb of inti an official from the 21st nome of upper egypt who lived during the late fifth dynasty
the scene shows egyptian soldiers scaling the walls of a near eastern fortress on ladders
more generally ancient egyptians seem to have regularly organised punitive raids in canaan during the later old kingdom period but did not attempt to establish a permanent dominion there
it was called nefer isesi or nefer djedkare in ancient egyptian variously translated as isesi djedkare is beautiful or isesi djedkare is perfect
it is known today as haram el @-@ shawwâf el @-@ kably meaning the southern sentinel pyramid because it stands on the edge of the nile valley
the pyramid originally comprised six or seven steps made of irregular and roughly hewn limestone blocks and mortar of which only three survive
this core was overlaid by casing stones of white tura limestone which have been stolen in antiquity
at the time of its construction the pyramid stood <num> m <num> ft high with a base length of <num>
<num> m <num>
<num> ft and an inclination angle of <num> °
in the interior of the pyramid a descending passage led behind three granite portcullises to an antechamber three magazine rooms and the burial chamber
in it pieces of alabaster and a faience bead on a gold thread were discovered as well as many fragments of what was originally a large sarcophagus of dark grey basalt
the sarcophagus was sunk into the floor of the burial chamber together with a niche for the canopic chest of the king to its north @-@ east
an almost complete mummy was discovered in the remnants of the sarcophagus
an examination by ahmed batrawi of these skeletal remains excavated in the mid @-@ <num> under the direction of abdel salam hussein suggests that djedkare died at the age of <num> to <num> years old
to the east of the pyramid djedkare 's mortuary temple was laid out
the east facade of the mortuary temple was flanked by two massive stone structures which resemble the later pylons
the mortuary temple is connected via a yet unexcavated causeway to a valley temple
joyce tyldesley sees the reign of djedkare isesi as the very beginning of a decline in the importance of the king in conjunction with the gradual rise of the power wielded by the high and provincial administration
concurrent with this trend is a process of decentralization with local loyalties slowly superseding allegiance to the central state
since offices and in particular the vizierate could be inherited the reforms of djedkare isesi created a virtual feudal system as nicolas grimal writes with much power in the hands of a few puissant officials
this is best witnessed by the large magnificent mastaba tombs that djedkare 's viziers built
in this context djedkare 's reforms of the ranking system might have been an attempt at maintaining a sprawling administration under control yet ultimately failed
for some egyptologists such as naguib kanawati this failure contributed in no small part to the fall of the old kingdom but others including strudwick believe the reasons of the collapse must be sought elsewhere as the power of an administration official never approached that of the king
the reforms of djedkare isesi played an important role in flourishing of the arts during the later old kingdom as artisans and craftsmen could now find many wealthy patrons beyond the king
this created a surge in the number of commissions leading to a general improvement of the artistic works
this also provided the artisans with a new wealth which they used to build their own large funerary complexes
provisions for this cult were produced in several agricultural estates set up during djedkare 's reign
the names of some of these estates have been found inscribed on the walls of the tombs of his courtiers ra desires that isesi lives heqa desires that izezi live perfect of emulation is isesi the mnza @-@ vessel of djedkare perfect of favors is isesi seshat makes isesi live the ka of isesi is foremost dominion belongs to izezi work of the command of izezi bastet wishes that izezi lives horus perpetuates izezi the offerings of izezi and izezi is one who loves life
djedkare seems to have been held in high esteem during the sixth dynasty
for example merenre nemtyemsaf i chose to place his pyramid complex close to that of djedkare
in addition the south saqqara stone a royal annal dating to the reign of merenre or of his successor pepi ii records rich offerings being made to djedkare on behalf of the king
an estimated <num> of the text inscribed on the stone was lost when it was roughly polished to be reused as a sarcophagus lid possibly in the late first intermediate c
<num> – <year> bc to early middle kingdom period c
<year> – <year> bc
more generally an historical or literary tradition concerning events in the time of djedkare seems to have flourished toward the end of old kingdom as can be inferred from the tombs of harkuf and iny
these two officials were in charge of expeditions to foreign lands – punt and byblos – under merenre i and pepi ii and both relate similar expeditions that took place during the time of djedkare isesi
<year> – <num> bce
for the early part of this period this is best attested by the karnak king list a list of kings commissioned by pharaoh thutmose iii
the list was not meant to be exhaustive rather it gave the names of thutmose 's forefathers whom he wanted to honor by dedicating offerings
for the later new kingdom a relief from the saqqara tomb of the priest mehu dating to the <num> or <num> dynasty shows three gods faced by several deceased pharaohs
these are djoser and sekhemket of the third dynasty and userkaf founder of the fifth dynasty
he is followed by a fourth king whose name is damaged but which is often read djedkare or much less likely shepseskare
the relief is an expression of personal piety on mehu 's behalf who prayed to the ancient kings for them to recommend him to the gods

on the morning of august <num> <year> at around <num> <num> edt the bombardier canadair regional jet 100er that was being used for the flight crashed while attempting to take off from blue grass airport in fayette county kentucky four miles <num> kilometers west of the central business district of the city of lexington
the aircraft was assigned the airport 's runway <num> for the takeoff but used runway <num> instead
runway <num> was too short for a safe takeoff causing the aircraft to overrun the end of the runway before it could become airborne
it crashed just past the end of the runway killing all <num> passengers and two of the three crew
the flight 's first officer was the only survivor
although not the pilot in command according to the cockpit voice recorder transcript the first officer was the pilot flying at the time of the accident
in the national transportation safety board report on the crash investigators concluded that the likely cause of the crash was pilot error
it is usually identified as comair flight <num>
the flight had been scheduled to land at hartsfield @-@ jackson atlanta international airport at <num> <num> a
m
the aircraft involved was a <num> @-@ seat bombardier canadair regional jet crj @-@ 100er serial number <num>
manufactured in canada in january <year> it was delivered to the airline on january <num> <year>
analysis of the cockpit voice recorder cvr indicated the aircraft was cleared to take off from runway <num> a <num> @,@ <num> feet <num> @,@ <num> m strip used by most airline traffic at lexington
instead after confirming runway two @-@ two captain jeffrey clay taxied onto runway <num> an unlit secondary runway only <num> @,@ <num> feet <num> @,@ <num> m long and turned the controls over to first officer james polehinke for takeoff
the air traffic controller was not required to maintain visual contact with the aircraft after clearing the aircraft for takeoff he turned to perform administrative duties and did not see the aircraft taxi to the runway
ntsb investigators concluded that the likely cause of the crash was pilot error
the board concluded that clay and polehinke ignored clues that they were on the wrong runway failed to confirm their position on the runway and talked too much in violation of sterile cockpit procedures
comair later accepted responsibility for the crash but also placed blame on the airport for what it called poor runway signs and markings and the federal aviation administration which had only one air traffic controller on duty contrary to a memo it had previously issued to have two workers on overnight shifts
a judge ruled that since it was owned by county governments the airport had sovereign immunity and could not be sued by comair
based upon an estimated takeoff weight of <num> @,@ <num> pounds <num> @,@ <num> kg the manufacturer calculated a speed of <num> knots <num> miles per hour or <num> kilometers per hour and a distance of <num> @,@ <num> feet <num> @,@ <num> m would have been needed for rotation increasing nose @-@ up pitch with more runway needed to achieve lift @-@ off
at a speed approaching <num> knots <num> mph polehinke remarked that is weird with no lights referring to the lack of lighting on runway <num> – it was about an hour before daybreak
yeah confirmed clay but the flight data recorder gave no indication either pilot tried to abort the takeoff as the aircraft accelerated to <num> knots <num> mph
clay called for rotation but the aircraft sped off the end of the runway before it could lift off
it then struck a low earthen wall adjacent to a ditch becoming momentarily airborne clipped the airport perimeter fence with its landing gear and smashed into trees separating the fuselage and flight deck from the tail
the aircraft struck the ground about <num> @,@ <num> feet <num> m from the end of the runway
forty @-@ nine of the <num> people on board perished in the accident most of them died instantly in the initial impact
the resulting fire destroyed the aircraft
comair released the passenger manifest on august <num> <year>
most of the passengers were us citizens from the lexington area ranging in age from <num> to <num>
they included a young couple who had been married the previous day and were traveling to california on their honeymoon
a memorial service for the victims was held on august <num> <year> at the lexington opera house
a second public memorial service was held on september <num> <year> at rupp arena in lexington
the lexington herald @-@ leader published a list of the victims with short biographies
the flight <num> memorial commission was established shortly after the crash to create an appropriate memorial for the victims first responders and community that supported them
the commission chose the university of kentucky arboretum as its memorial site
lexington @-@ fayette and airport police officers pulled polehinke out of the wreckage
polehinke underwent surgery for his injuries including an amputation of his left leg
doctors later determined that polehinke had suffered brain damage and has no memory of the crash or the events leading up to it
as of august <year> polehinke was a wheelchair user
during the same month polehinke filed a lawsuit against the airport and the company that designed the runway and taxi lights
a january <year> episode of piers morgan live reported that polehinke was paraplegic
the estates or families of <num> of the <num> passengers filed lawsuits against polehinke
in response polehinke 's attorney william e
johnson raised the possibility of contributory negligence on the part of the passengers
when asked by the plaintiffs attorney david royse what that meant johnson replied that
they
should have been aware of the dangerous conditions that existed in that there had been considerable media coverage about the necessity of improving runway conditions at the airport
at the time johnson submitted the contributory negligence defense he had not yet been able to speak to polehinke himself
by the time newspapers reported on the court documents johnson said he had already told royse who criticized the statements that he would withdraw the argument
prior to his employment by comair polehinke worked for gulfstream international as a captain
at the time of the accident the single controller in the tower was performing both tower and radar duties
on august <num> <year> the faa announced that lexington as well as other airports with similar traffic levels would be staffed with two controllers in the tower around the clock effective immediately
comair discovered after the accident that all of its pilots had been using an airport map that did not accurately reflect changes made to the airport layout during ongoing construction work
the ntsb later determined that this did not contribute to the accident
construction work was halted after the accident on the orders of fayette circuit judge pamela goodwine in order to preserve evidence in the crash pending the inspection by safety experts and attorneys for the families of the victims
in april <year> acting on a recommendation made by the national transportation safety board ntsb during its investigation of comair <num> the faa issued a safety notice that reiterated advice to pilots to positively confirm their position before crossing the hold @-@ short line onto the take @-@ off runway and again when initiating takeoff
and in may acting on another ntsb recommendation the faa advised that pilot training should include specific guidance on runway lighting requirements for take @-@ off at night
the ntsb released several reports on january <num> <year> including transcripts and recordings of the cvr and an engineering report
in april <year> the ntsb made four further recommendations three measures to avoid fatigue affecting the performance of air traffic controllers and one to prevent controllers from carrying out non @-@ essential administrative tasks while aircraft are taxiing under their control
although these recommendations were published during the course of the ntsb 's investigation into the accident to comair flight <num> they were in part prompted by four earlier accidents and the board was unable to determine whether fatigue contributed to the comair accident
in july <year> a flying instructor for comair testified that he would have failed both pilots for violating sterile cockpit rules
later the same month the ntsb released its final report into the accident citing this non @-@ pertinent conversation as a contributing factor in the accident
in july <year> united states district judge karl forester ruled delta will not be held liable for the crash because while comair is a wholly owned subsidiary of the atlanta @-@ based airline comair maintains its own management and policies and employs its own pilots
in december of the following year forester granted a passenger family 's motion for partial summary judgment determining as a matter of law that comair 's flight crew was negligent and that this negligence was a substantial factor causing the crash of flight <num>
runway <num> <num> on blue grass airport was closed on march <year> and the new <num> foot runway runway <num> <num> opened on august <num> <year>
this runway has been built on a separate location not connected to the runway <num>
families of <num> of the <num> passengers sued comair for negligence
families of the other two victims settled with the airline before filing litigation
three sample cases were due to be heard on august <num> <year> but the trial was indefinitely postponed after comair reached a settlement with the majority of the families
cases brought by comair against the airport authority and the faa arguing each should share in the compensation payments are now resolved
the case against the airport authority was dismissed on sovereign immunity grounds and this ruling was upheld by the kentucky supreme court on october <num> <year>
in comair 's case against the united states a settlement was reached with the united states agreeing to pay <num> of the liability for the crash while comair agreed to pay the remaining <num>
all but one of the passengers families settled their cases
after a four @-@ day jury trial in lexington kentucky that ended on december <num> <year> the estate and daughters of <num> ‑ year ‑ old bryan woodward were awarded compensatory damages in the amount of <num>
<num> million
while comair challenged this verdict as excessive on april <num> <year> judge forester overruled comair 's objections and upheld the verdict
the woodward case formally known as hebert v
comair was set for a punitive damages jury trial july <num> <year>
in that trial a different jury was to decide whether comair was guilty of gross negligence that was a substantial factor causing the crash and if so the amount of any punitive damages the jury deemed appropriate
the decision to allow a jury trial was reversed in a later hearing with the judge ruling that the company couldn 't be punished for the reprehensible conduct of its pilot
contributing to the accident were the flight crew 's nonpertinent conversations during taxi which resulted in a loss of positional awareness and the federal aviation administration 's failure to require that all runway crossings be authorized only by specific air traffic control clearances
captain clay 's wife strongly disputes laying primary blame on the pilots stating that other factors contributed including an under @-@ staffed control tower and an inaccurate runway map
tower personnel noticed the mistake and canceled the aircraft 's takeoff clearance just as the crew realized their error
the aircraft subsequently made a safe departure from runway <num>
in january <year> a learjet was cleared to take off at blue grass airport on runway <num> but mistakenly turned onto runway <num>
takeoff clearance was canceled by the local controller prior to the start of the takeoff roll
on october <num> <year> the crew of singapore airlines flight <num> mistakenly used a closed runway for departure from chiang kai @-@ shek international airport taipei
the boeing <num> @-@ <num> collided with construction equipment during the takeoff roll resulting in the deaths of <num> of the <num> passengers and crew on board
located between ullevål stadion and tåsen stations it is the first station after the ring line leaves the sognsvann line
the station is located <num>
<num> kilometres <num>
<num> mi from stortinget station
berg is amongst the original stations on the line and was opened on <num> october <year>
it was upgraded and rebuilt in the <num> when the sognsvann line was upgraded from light rail to rapid transit standard
three accidents have taken place at berg station the latest in <year>
the area around the station is mainly residential
berg upper secondary school is located approximately <num> metres <num> ft from the station
residential areas at sogn tåsen and berg were starting to grow in pace with a larger suburban development plan
akersbanerne bought new property along the line upon which new houses were to be designed by the norwegian architect kristofer lange <year> – <year>
the line was originally double @-@ tracked from majorstuen to korsvoll now østhorn station and single @-@ tracked from korsvoll to sognsvann
on <num> february <year> the section from korsvoll to sognsvann was upgraded to double tracks and korsvoll station had its name changed to østhorn
in the <num> the stations on the sognsvann line were rebuilt
the platforms were lengthened from fitting two @-@ car to fitting four @-@ car trains and the platform height was increased
the third rail made it impossible to cross the line at @-@ grade an underpass was therefore constructed at berg station
the station was also redesigned in concrete with steel columns and wooden sheds designed by architect arne henriksen
in <year> oslo sporveier presented plans involving a rapid transit circle line in oslo connecting the newly built hospital rikshospitalet with the rest of the city
a detailed suggestion was presented by oslo sporveier in august <year>
in the local newspaper aftenposten aften there was a debate on whether there should be a ring line from berg along the national road <num> towards gaustad over rikshospitalet or whether the ullevål hageby line should be extended from john colletts plass to rikshospitalet thereby creating a correspondence with the sognsvann line at the new station forskningsparken
in the first plans berg was meant to be a station on the new ring line
this plan was discarded since local residents feared noise pollution and destroyed lawns
even though berg was not made a station on the ring line noise shields were put up along the sognsvann line
berg station has seen many accidents and almost @-@ accidents
in <year> a deadly accident occurred between ullevål and berg stations when a train ran over a <num> @-@ year @-@ old man walking in the tracks
in <year> a <num> @-@ year @-@ old man was run over by a metro train approaching the station
the man survived the accident with minor wounds
in <year> a <num> @-@ year @-@ old drunk man was found crawling around on the tracks between the platforms
the police removed him from the station and sent him home in a taxi
the rapid transit serves the station every <num> minutes except in the late evening and on weekend mornings when there is a <num> @-@ minute headway
travel time along the <num>
<num> @-@ kilometre <num>
<num> mi portion to stortinget in the city center is <num> minutes
the station provides correspondence to the bus lines <num> and <num> at a nearby bus stop in kaj munks vei
the sheds are designed by arne henriksen in a minimalistic and standardised style with constructions of wood and steel
the area berg is named after an old farm from <num> with the same name
the street john colletts allé starting from john colletts plass in ullevål hageby ends at berg station
kaj munks vei as part of the norwegian national road <num> runs parallel with the line from ullevål stadion via berg to tåsen and continues thereafter towards nydalen
there are many swiss chalet and functionalist style houses in the residential area around the station
berg upper secondary school is located <num> metres <num> ft from the station
beginning in the monashee mountains to the north the upper adams river flows mainly southward and eventually reaches adams lake
the lower adams river begins at the southern end of the lake and flows into the extreme western end of shuswap lake
the river is one of the most important sockeye salmon breeding areas in north america
the run occurs in mid @-@ october and can bring millions of fish to a concentrated area near the river mouth
excavations of secwepemc villages on the river have shown a long tradition of habitation and salmon fishing in the area
the river also served as an important transportation route for early logging operations in the watershed
the upper portion of the river flows roughly south and southwest through wetlands and passes through two small lakes tumtum and mica
it has sections of rapids and whitewater and flows over cataracts below tumtum lake
its flow drops by <num> metres <num> ft per kilometre in certain sections
after travelling for <num> kilometres <num> mi and entering the shuswap highland it enters the northern end of adams lake
adams lake is roughly <num> kilometres <num> mi along its north @-@ south axis and reaches a maximum depth of <num> metres <num> @,@ <num> ft making it the <num> deepest lake in the world
the lower adams issues from the extreme southern end of the lake and travels <num> kilometres <num>
<num> mi through a narrow valley
it empties into shuswap lake near the community of squilax
from adams lake to the shuswap the lower adams drops <num> metres <num> ft in elevation
a <year> study by the provincial government along the lower river found sixty @-@ six sites with evidence of habitation dating to <year> bce
the abundance of the salmon run made the river an important food source and trade commodity for first nations people in the region
ethnographer james teit records that the people of the adams river area formed a sub @-@ group of the secwepemc called the sxste 'lln now known as the adams lake indian band
the sxste 'lln moved between summer and winter camps at the outlet of the lower river and the little river area near chase
the river 's namesake chief sel @-@ howt @-@ ken baptized as adam by oblate missionaries was a sxste 'lln leader in the <num>
like more than <num> of his people he died in the <year> smallpox epidemic

mcgoldrick an experienced lumberman from spokane established the adams river lumber company in <year>
he licensed large tracts of timber along both the upper and lower rivers as well as the surrounding plateau
mcgoldrick 's company is described as the first major industrial operation in the british columbia interior
a camp was built on the upper river and logging operations began at tumtum lake
the cut logs were run down the river then towed in booms by the company owned sternwheeler helen down adams lake
the logs then were run down the lower river to the mill at chase
in <year> adams river logging constructed a splash dam at the outlet of the lower adams
this dam allowed operators to raise the water level of adams lake
when sufficient logs had been collected above the dam the gates were opened and the resulting flood carried the logs to shuswap lake
this proved to be destructive to the salmon run as it damaged the gravel beds the fish use to spawn
in order to move logs from the plateau above the lower river adams river lumber constructed several flumes
the flumes were elevated wooden troughs filled with water that floated logs down to the valley bottom
the largest of these was at bear creek
it incorporated trestles up to <num> metres <num> ft high and was capable of moving <num> @,@ <num> @,@ <num> metres <num> @,@ <num> @,@ <num> ft of logs per month
it was the largest flume in north america at its peak
the structures were dismantled after the areas became logged out
although logging continues in the region the adams is no longer used for log transport
the river travels through several different vegetation zones
in its upper reaches the adams flows through the interior cedar hemlock zone
these forests are similar to the coastal forests of british columbia and contain old @-@ growth trees up to <num> years in age
old @-@ growth stands along the river also contain rare species of lichen likely isolated by the last ice age
the floodplain of the upper adams contains wetland species of deciduous trees such as black cottonwood as well as a dense layer of shrubs including black twinberry red @-@ osier dogwood and thimbleberry
the lower river is dominated by the drier interior douglas fir vegetation zone
other conifer species present are ponderosa pine engelmann spruce and alpine fir
the area around the river mouth has been altered by human activities such as farming and livestock grazing
from the strait of georgia they spend three years in the open ocean following arctic currents to alaska and the aleutian islands
they then retrace their route to the adams completing a round trip of over <num> @,@ <num> kilometres <num> @,@ <num> mi
they complete the arduous trip upstream including navigating the swift waters and rapids of the fraser canyon in just seventeen days
they do not eat during this period instead they rely on fat reserves stored up from heavy feeding in the strait of georgia in the late summer
it is at this point that the salmon take on their distinctive red hue with the male fish also developing large humped backs and aggressive hooked mouths
how they are able navigate back to their natal river is not fully understood but a highly developed olfactory system is believed to play a part
the alluvial gravel deposits that form the adams river bottom are ideal for the development of salmon roe and alevins
the temperature and neutral ph of the water is also well @-@ suited to the sockeye
shuswap lake below the river is called a nursery lake by biologists due to its high concentration of picoplankton a food source for young salmon
<year> was the most recent dominant run
according to canada 's department of fisheries and oceans the fraser river sockeye run of <year> was the largest since <year> numbering an estimated <num> million fish
at least <num> @,@ <num> @,@ <num> of these fish returned to the adams river to spawn
there is no clear consensus as to why the adams stock has rebounded so remarkably <year> saw an estimated return of <num> fish
in the globe and mail simon fraser university biologist john reynolds said “ predicting salmon numbers is massively complex even for a scientist
black bears are common in the watershed
the bear population grows substantially during the fall as they gather from adjacent valleys to feed on the spawning salmon
in the upper river valley moose are common and the headwaters of the river contain grizzly bear habitat
several species of aquatic mammals are found on the river including beaver mink and river otter
the river 's mouth has populations of canada geese and swans
other waterfowl include mallards green @-@ winged teal and goldeneye
the river supports bald eagle and osprey populations whose eyries can be seen high up in black cottonwood and dead conifers
grouse especially ruffed grouse are numerous throughout the valley
human visitors to roderick haig @-@ brown provincial park were estimated at <num> @,@ <num> in <year>

kadokawa shoten collected the stories into a bound volume and published it on july <num> <year>
in <year> tokyopop announced that it had licensed the one i love for an english @-@ language translation along with four other manga by clamp it published the one i love on october <num> <year>

the one i love has also been translated into other languages including french by editions tonkam and german by egmont manga anime
while considering it one of clamp 's minor works he stated that it was unusual for including some colored pages when the majority of manga is printed in black and white being a slice @-@ of @-@ life manga and featuring tsubaki nekoi 's art as prior to the time of his review most of their works translated into english had been drawn by another member of clamp
koulikov wrote that insecurity and self @-@ doubt served as the theme of the anthology
johanna draper carlson a reviewer for publishers weekly wrote that some of the stories were worrisome particularly one that she felt justifies having an interest in whatever your boyfriend likes and contained stereotypes as a result of limited space
she also stated that the essays included generalizations about women and quickly become redundant
in manga the complete guide mason templar suggested a possible theme of being one 's self in relationships but felt that it appeared almost anti @-@ feminist in execution as only the female characters underwent a change in behavior
templar rated the series one @-@ and @-@ a @-@ half out of four stars and criticized it as a naïve take on romance templar suggested cardcaptor sakura chobits or man of many faces as better examples of clamp 's romantic manga
a reviewer of the french edition wrote that repetitive nature of the stories detracted from the manga 's appeal and made for a laborious reading experience although the reviewer felt that a romantic reader would not mind this
conversely another reviewer for anime news network liann cooper wrote that the stories were incredibly sweet and touching and were best read a few stories at a time
according to cooper the one i love would appeal to fans of clamp or shōjo manga targeted towards girls

though he garnered fame for his books fuel @-@ injected dreams and boy wonder after the controversy surrounding publication of his novel tim and pete he faced increasing difficulty having his work published
according to his life partner this was a contributing factor in his suicide
baker 's work has achieved cult status in the years since his death and two additional novels have been posthumously published
first @-@ edition copies of his earlier works have become collector 's items
his novel testosterone was adapted to a film of the same name though it was not a financial success
two other books have been optioned for films but they have not been produced
rebelling against his parents he became attracted to the fringe elements of society including beatniks anyone living as a bohemian acting rebelliously or appearing to advocate a revolution in manners artists and gays
in high school during the <num> he explored his sexuality at underground gay teen nightclubs while living in fear that his abusive father would find out
at one point his father hired a private detective to follow him when he suspected baker was having an affair with a male neighbor
this family dynamic would be used in many of his novels most extensively in boy wonder
baker began taking drugs and became in his own words an out of control teenage speed freak
he also began drinking heavily attributing it to the fact that he was closeted
however even after coming out his substance abuse remained excessive and still had a life of its own
after sobering up he attended ucla film school where he was one of the winners of the samuel goldwyn writing awards and directed two films mouse klub konfidential and blonde death
mouse klub konfidential a film about a mickey mouse club mouseketeer who becomes a gay bondage pornographer was a controversial entry in the <year> san francisco 's lgbt film festival as some thought baker was actually advocating nazism
it is also credited with having caused michael medved to abandon his dream of film making and instead become a film critic
upon graduating from ucla he spent approximately five years writing hollywood screenplays in the early <num> a process he hated
while financially successful he was frustrated that his work was not being produced
i felt like a door @-@ to @-@ door salesman going to all these story pitch meetings
filled with rabid hideous morons
he became discouraged and disillusioned and turned his attention to novels
his first book adrenaline was published under the pseudonym james dillinger
a story of two gay fugitive lovers on the run it presaged the satire and drug fueled violence so prominent in his later books
here baker began developing the themes that dominated his following works anarchy angry and somewhat paranoid gay men the dark underside of los angeles juxtaposed with its sunny outward image the hypocrisy of organized religion anonymous sex and its implications in the age of aids and homophobia and the oppression of gays in a republican dominated america
its plot device of underdog characters forced into flight due to circumstances beyond their control was one baker explored in all of his subsequent work
the modest success of this novel encouraged him to devote himself to what have become his best known works fuel @-@ injected dreams a novel revolving around a character loosely based on record producer phil spector and the <year> release boy wonder
after the novel was published he stopped screenwriting in order to solely concentrate on books
he spent the bulk of each day writing and researching and acted out characters and scenes of his novels on videotape to perfect the dialogue
his primary focus was gay @-@ themed writing though he also wrote about the entertainment industry
mostly satirical his writing was filled with increasingly clear anger and disdain for the republican neo @-@ con agenda especially after the aids pandemic began to take a large toll on the gay community
a very strong voice in gay literature baker had admirers and detractors for his gay radical stance both in the mainstream literary community as well as the gay community itself
a self @-@ described anarchist baker has been categorized as a writer of transgressional fiction in that his novels are frequently populated by sociopathic nihilistic characters who engage in taboo behaviors such as heavy drug use incest necrophilia and other practices and often commit acts of extreme surrealistic violence
a man of eclectic tastes baker cited as literary influences writers and film directors ranging from proust to jim thompson and sam peckinpah
he also admired the punk writer dennis cooper
his work is filled with pop cultural references to both film and music as well as politics
orson welles touch of evil and john ford 's the searchers are mentioned prominently in more than one of his books and roxy music is referenced in virtually every novel he wrote
the imagery in his novels is largely cinematic with expressions such as fade in fade out quick cut and vistavision and sentences such as a montage traces the next fifteen years and if the last reel of cheryl 's life had been a cinemascope technicolor movie

with driven narratives his books have the feel of a movie set down on paper
his only two books not specifically gay themed though containing gay characters and a somewhat gay sensibility boy wonder and fuel @-@ injected dreams were better received by critics and more popular with readers though he was never a bestselling novelist
baker himself estimated that his books sold approximately <num> @,@ <num> copies each
his following book however tim and pete met with hostile reviews primarily for its advocacy of political assassination and terror tactics in combating aids discrimination
baker himself was ambivalent on the subject
i think assassination does change things
but i 'm not really calling for violence he said
it 's a novel not a position paper
in a <year> interview however baker stated i think a strong case can be made that political assassination actually does change things
if you look at the assassinations in this country in the <num> you can certainly see how it affected history in a very profound way
so if you killed right wing figures you 'd also be altering the course of history and eliminating people who might very well be president in <year> and those who are making bashing gays their number one issue right now
on the one hand i 'm not advocating pwa 's turn themselves into human bombs but on the other hand i have to admit that if i clicked on cnn and heard somebody had blown patrick buchanan 's head clean off i 'd be elated and to say otherwise would be a lie
there were also charges of racism due to his portrayals of blacks and hispanics
baker denied those charges and pointed out that the protagonist later realized that the blacks were also gay and the latina was just a sweet old woman putting up with a lot of stuff that i couldn 't even imagine
he went on to say i just wanted to explore the conflicts between gays and latinos and gays and blacks
the real feelings and the misapprehensions of each other
i realized it wouldn 't all be nice and politically correct
if blacks and latinos want my respect they have to deal with their own homophobia
i 'm not playing guilty liberal anymore
the book caused a great deal of controversy among critics with some calling it irresponsible and saying it was determined to give offense and appears to endorse violence
one critic of the book wrote the work rapidly becomes an apology for political terrorism and effectively advocates the assassination of the entire american new right
while the reasons for such a vengeance motif are perhaps evident can it really be countenanced are we still justified in referring to this as art and even if we are is there a point at which such invective and such suggestions become simply counterproductive another critic however called it a masterful creation and wrote in coming years baker will be seen as having understood the implications of this period in our history while the rest of us were simply living it
it polarized the reading public as well with letters to the editor of major newspapers both supporting and opposing baker 's ideology
baker himself was aware that the book would be controversial and deliberately provoked much of the reaction he received
he said tim and pete tries to convey in print what people really think rather than what they should think or what 's p
c
he was only able to publish one novella right wing and that was self @-@ published on the internet
baker 's life partner ron robertson believes that this difficulty led baker on a quick downwards emotional spiral
baker killed himself at his home on november <num> <year> by asphyxiation in his garage
his death was noted in literary circles and mainstream press the gay times in the united kingdom wrote baker 's suicide is particularly tragic because it robs american gay writing of a refreshingly distinctive voice quite unlike the po @-@ faced prose of so many of his contemporaries
by <year> first editions of adrenaline boy wonder fuel @-@ injected dreams and tim and pete had become collector 's items and commanded high prices at rare book stores
robertson now baker 's literary executor was successful in having two additional novels published after baker 's death
one of those testosterone was filmed in <year>
directed by david moreton and starring antonio sabato jr
the plot was significantly altered and the film was a critical and financial failure
both boy wonder and fuel @-@ injected dreams have been optioned for the movies several times most recently in <year> though they were never produced
baker 's work has also been published in germany sweden italy great britain australia japan and russia
though tim and pete was his most controversial work boy wonder is generally considered his magnum opus and remains his most popular book
a black satire of the film industry it is also a parody of the oral biographies popularized by george plimpton with his books about edie sedgwick and truman capote in that the protagonist 's life is revealed in the form of interviews between the writer and the characters
though it has been praised as one of the few novels from the last couple of decades that could justifiably be called a classic reviewers have also pointed out that it is probably unfilmable due to its bitter cynicism regarding the movie industry
baker 's last published work right wing as well as his posthumous novels testosterone and anarchy represent a stylistic departure in that he inserts himself into the plot as either a secondary character or the protagonist
the latter two were edited and in the case of anarchy partially rewritten by his editor scott brassart
testosterone needed only minor changes while anarchy underwent an entire rewrite with brassart restructuring the plot and streamlining over <num> pages of prose and notes into a fast @-@ paced <num> page novel
for the reader however it is only baker 's voice as writer that is heard
three of baker 's books have thus far not been published white devils proto punk and crucifying todd
additionally he wrote two screenplays which have not as yet been filmed inez and desert women

simon de montfort had seized power in england following his victory over henry iii at the battle of lewes during the second barons war but his grip on the country was under threat
in an attempt to gather more support he summoned representatives from not only the barons and the knights of the shires as had occurred in previous parliaments but also burgesses from the major towns
the resulting parliament in london discussed radical reforms and temporarily stabilised montfort 's political situation
montfort was killed at the battle of evesham later that year but the idea of inviting both knights and burgesses to parliaments became more popular under the reign of henry 's son edward i
by the <num> century this had become the norm with the gathering becoming known as the house of commons
this parliament is sometimes referred to as the first english parliament and montfort himself is often termed the founder of the commons
anger had grown about the way the king 's officials were raising funds the influence of his poitevin relatives at court and his unpopular sicilian policy even the english church had grievances over its treatment by the king
within henry 's court there was a strong feeling that the king would be unable to lead the country through these problems
on <num> april hugh bigod marched into westminster in the middle of the king 's parliament backed by his co @-@ conspirators including simon de montfort the earl of leicester and carried out a coup d 'état
henry fearful that he was about to be arrested and imprisoned agreed to abandon his policy of personal rule and instead govern through a council of <num> barons and churchmen half chosen by the king and half by the barons
the pressure for reform continued to grow unabated and a parliament met in june
the term parliament had first appeared in the <num> and <num> to describe large gatherings of the royal court and parliamentary gatherings were held periodically throughout henry 's reign
they were used to agree upon the raising of taxes which in the <num> century were single one @-@ off levies typically on movable property intended to support the king 's normal revenues for particular projects
during henry 's reign the counties had begun to send regular delegations to these parliaments and came to represent a broader cross @-@ section of the community than simply the major barons
the new parliament passed a set of measures known as the provisions of oxford which henry swore to uphold
these provisions created a smaller council of <num> members elected solely by the barons which then had the power to appoint england 's justiciar chancellor and treasurer and which would be monitored through triennial parliaments
pressure from the lesser barons and the gentry present at oxford also helped to push through wider reform intended to limit the abuse of power by both the king 's officials and the major barons
more radical measures were passed by the new council the next year in the form of the provisions of westminster
the disagreements between the leading barons involved in the revolt soon became evident
montfort championed radical reforms that would place further limitations on the authority and power of the major barons as well as the crown others promoted only moderate change while the conservative barons expressed concerns about the existing limitations on the king 's powers
over the next four years neither henry nor the barons were able to restore stability in england and power swung back and forth between the different factions
by early <num> what remained of henry 's authority had disintegrated and the country slipped back towards open civil war
montfort convened a council of rebel barons in oxford to pursue his radical agenda and by october england faced a likely civil war
montfort marched east with an army and london rose up in revolt
montfort took henry and queen eleanor prisoner and although he maintained a fiction of ruling in henry 's name the rebels completely replaced the royal government and household with their own trusted men
montfort 's coalition began to quickly fragment henry regained his freedom of movement and renewed chaos spread across england
henry appealed to his brother @-@ in @-@ law louis of france for arbitration in the dispute montfort was initially hostile to this idea but as war became more likely again he decided to agree to french arbitration as well
initially montfort 's legal arguments held sway but in january <num> louis announced the mise of amiens condemning the rebels upholding the king 's rights and annulling the provisions of oxford
the second barons war finally broke out in april when henry led an army into montfort 's territories
becoming desperate montfort marched in pursuit of henry and the two armies met at the battle of lewes on <num> may
despite their numerical superiority henry 's forces were overwhelmed
captured henry was forced to pardon the rebel barons and reinstate the provisions of oxford leaving him as historian adrian jobson describes little more than a figurehead
however he had effective political control over the government even though he was not himself the monarch the first time this had happened in english history
montfort successfully held a parliament in london in june <num> to confirm new constitutional arrangements for england four knights were summoned from each county chosen by the county court and were allowed to comment on general matters of state – the first time this had occurred
montfort was unable to consolidate his victory at lewes however and widespread disorder persisted across the country
in france eleanor made plans for an invasion of england with the support of louis
in response and hoping to win wider support for his government montfort summoned a new parliament for <num> january <num> which continued until mid march that year
it was held at short notice with the summons being issued on <num> december leaving little time for attendees to respond
he summoned not only the barons senior churchmen and two knights from each county but also two burgesses from each of the major towns such as york lincoln sandwich and the cinque ports the first time this had been done
due to the lack of support for montfort among the barons only <num> of them were summoned to parliament in comparison to the summons issued to <num> churchmen who largely supported the new government it is unknown how many burgesses were called
the event was overseen by king henry and held in the palace of westminster london which was the largest city in england and whose continuing loyalty was essential to montfort 's cause
this parliament was a populist tactical move by montfort in an attempt to gather support from the regions and the historian jeffrey hamilton characterises it as a very partisan assembly not some sort of proto @-@ democratic representative body
once again the representatives were allowed to comment on wider political matters than just the usual issues of taxation
the business of the parliament focused on enforcing the provisions of westminster in particular its restrictions on the major nobles and promising judicial help to those who felt they were suffering from unfair feudal lordship
the parliament bought temporary calm but opposition grew once more particularly as montfort and his immediate family began to amass a huge personal fortune
prince edward escaped his captors in may and formed a new army resulting in a fresh outbreak of civil war
edward pursued monfort 's forces through the welsh marches before striking east to attack his fortress at kenilworth and then turning once more on the rebel leader himself
montfort accompanied by the captive henry was unable to retreat and the battle of evesham ensued
edward was triumphant and montfort 's corpse was mutilated by the victors
in places the now leaderless rebellion dragged on with some rebels gathering at kenilworth which henry and edward took after a long siege in <num>
the remaining pockets of resistance were mopped up and the final rebels holed up on the isle of ely surrendered in july <num> marking the end of the war
after <num> under edward i 's reign this became the norm and by the early <num> century it was normal to include the knights and burgesses a grouping that would become known as the commons of england and ultimately form the house of commons
simon de montfort 's parliament of <num> is sometimes referred to as the first english parliament because of its inclusion of both the knights and the burgesses and montfort himself is often regarded as the founder of the house of commons
the <num> century historian william stubbs popularised the <num> model parliament of edward i as the first genuine parliament however modern scholarship questions this analysis
the historian david carpenter describes montfort 's <num> parliament as a landmark in the development of parliament as an institution during the medieval period
the house of lords record office now known as the parliamentary archives organised an exhibition in the houses of parliament of several important acts of parliament
some of these documents were displayed again in a <year> exhibition
in <year> parliament planned a year @-@ long programme of events called parliament in the making coordinated with parliament week including events to mark the <num> anniversary of montfort 's parliament
the bbc broadcast a democracy day on <num> january to coincide with the <num> anniversary consisting of live discussions and debate about parliament and democracy
it was presented in partnership with the speaker ’ s office of the house of commons including broadcasts from inside the palace of westminster
westminster abbey held a special evensong on <num> january commemorating the anniversary of the montfort parliament and the development of rights and representation

beginning in <year> she has served as indonesia 's goodwill ambassador to unesco focusing on educational issues
she is of mixed descent with her relatives coming from padang aceh banten pekalongan madiun and the middle east this caused her to question her identity as a child and teenager
despite being devout muslims her parents named her christine and natalia because she was born on christmas day
originally hakim did not intend to be an actress but an architect or psychologist
however she was cast in teguh karya 's <year> film cinta pertama after he saw pictures of her modelling in a magazine despite only modelling to help her friend and not wanting to act she was unable to decline karya 's request for fear of being impolite to such a warm and friendly person
she later described karya as having reeled her in slowly slowly like a fisherma and considered leaving acting after wrapping up filming
her work in cinta pertama garnered her a citra award for best actress which convinced her to continue acting
karya later told her that he had fought with his producer over her casting the producer expressed concern that hakim was too thin and had no chest to which karya replied are we selling a film or are we selling breasts the following year hakim starred in another karya @-@ directed film kawin lari elope
the experience gave her a greater understanding of acting causing her to see life from a different perspective in studying her character
it was followed by a role in <year> 's sesuatu yang indah something beautiful directed by wim umboh
sesuatu yang indah was the first film in which hakim used her own voice her voice had been dubbed by titi qadarsih in previous movies hakim 's own voice had been considered too heavy
the next year she starred in badai pasti berlalu appearing on the poster and the cover of the soundtrack album
hakim presented <num> indonesian films at the nantes three continents festival in november <year> she had acted in half of them
two years later she became an observer at the cannes film festival striking up a working relationship with pierre risient who later assisted her in bringing her films to cannes
one of these was eros djarot 's <year> film tjoet nja dhien in which hakim was cast as acehnese guerilla leader cut nyak dhien
it won the <year> cannes film festival award for best international film being screened in le semaine de critique
hakim later described the role as a huge honour and very challenging she has credited the role for answering her questions on her identity
the film later became indonesia 's submission to the <num> academy awards for the academy award for best foreign language film
hakim screened her first work as a producer daun di atas bantal leaf on a pillow during un certain regard at cannes ten years later
when producing the film she chose young director garin nugroho whom she perceived to be highly talented she also took the leading role
during production she made a mistake that required the reshooting of all footage
in an attempt to cut expenses she had saved all cans of exposed film to send to the developing lab at once the lab then notified her that a technical fault with the camera had rendered all of it unusable and that the problem could have been detected earlier had she sent each can as it was filmed
another production <year> 's pasir berbisik whispering sands went more smoothly
the film which hakim co @-@ produced and played the leading role was screened at the deauville asian film festival

the film is an adaptation of the novel of the same name by j
l
carr and stars colin firth kenneth branagh natasha richardson and patrick malahide
the screenplay was by simon gray
set in rural yorkshire during the summer of <year> the film follows a destitute world war i veteran employed to carry out restoration work on a medieval mural discovered in a rural church while coming to terms with the after @-@ effects of the war
shot during the summer of <year> and featuring an original score by howard blake the film has been neglected since its <year> cinema release and it was only in <year> that an original <num> mm film print was discovered due to the intervention of a fan
the escape to the idyllic countryside is cathartic for birkin haunted by his experiences in world war i
birkin soon fits into the slow @-@ paced life of the remote village and over the course of the summer uncovering the painting begins to lose his trauma @-@ induced stammer and tics
in particular he forms a close friendship with archaeologist james moon kenneth branagh another veteran who like birkin has been emotionally scarred by the war
moon is employed in the village under the same bequest working to uncover a mysterious lost grave but is more interested in discovering the remains of an earlier saxon church building in the field next to the churchyard
birkin becomes accepted into the nonconformist family of mr ellerbeck the station master jim carter with whom he dines on sundays the hospitality of the chapel congregation is contrasted against the established church who have consigned the penniless birkin to sleep in the church belfry
ellerbeck 's children eventually persuade birkin to preach a sermon at a nearby methodist chapel
birkin also forms an emotional albeit unspoken attachment to alice keach natasha richardson the young wife of the vicar
the vicar himself patrick malahide is portrayed unsympathetically as an obstruction to the work in the church viewing the medieval painting as symptomatic of the superstition prevalent in the community
although it was the third cinema feature film to cast colin firth it was his first lead role
similarly it was kenneth branagh 's first cinema film and natasha richardson 's second
conversely it was the last role of david garth who died in may <year>
colin firth as tom birkin kenneth branagh as james moon natasha richardson as alice keach patrick malahide as the reverend j

the original working title for the film was falling man
playwright simon gray was commissioned to write the screenplay and pat o ’ connor chosen to direct
in contrast to the book which is narrated as a recollection by birkin as an old man the film is set entirely in the <num> except for a brief moment towards the end
in initial drafts of the screenplay gray had included a narrator but o 'connor felt this was not the correct way to present the story i felt that if i couldn ’ t do it in the present suggesting internal pain by performance then i wouldn ’ t really want to do it at all
funding for the film was scarce and it eventually fell to euston films a subsidiary of thames television and channel four films who had had some success with low budget features such as my beautiful laundrette
despite being set in yorkshire the majority of location filming was moved to buckinghamshire although levisham railway station and the surrounding area in north yorkshire were utilised
the location shooting of the film began on august <num> <year> at st
mary 's church in radnage
filming was periodically hindered by inclement weather — the perfect summer in which the book was set was not forthcoming and scenes were filmed during breaks in heavy rain
interiors were shot at bray studios in berkshire
the church which is a main location for the film was substantially set @-@ dressed
despite having several original medieval wall paintings the largest addition was the creation of the medieval mural by artist margot noyes
to create the impression of an austere country church victorian stone flags were replaced with brick pavers for the duration of filming and the original wall paintings covered up
plastic guttering and other modern additions were covered up or removed
the churchyard had several gravestones added including the large box tomb which is a focus of several scenes
several members of the local community were used as extras in the film and local children were recruited by the director to collect butterflies to be released out @-@ of @-@ shot to create a summer feeling
however there was some opposition to the disruption caused by the filming and also problems involving unwelcome damage to a section of the interior plasterwork which had to be restored after filming had concluded
blake notes that the style chosen was intended to complement and contrast recordings of classical music during particular scenes verdi 's quattro pezzi sacri was used during the uncovering of the mediaeval mural and a flashback montage of the first world war which opened the film utilised an excerpt from schubert 's deutsche messe d
<num> zum sanctus heilig heilig ist der herr
howard blake recalls i went to a viewing and saw that the film was very profound with a serious anti @-@ war theme but a certain amount of found choral music had already been laid in by the editors
i explained that i loved the film and i thought the choral orchestral music worked brilliantly but it was very big and rich and i felt a score would have to emerge from it and be very pure and expressive and quite small — and that i could only hear this in my head as done by strings only
blake decided to compose his score to match the key of the schubert mass in order for the music to continue seamlessly
however during the recording session with his orchestra the sinfonia of london he found that the schubert piece was running slow and therefore flat and he had to ask the players to tune flat to match his intended key
due to the small budget of the film blake agreed in lieu of a reasonable fee to retain the copyright to his music
the score was subsequently arranged into a suite for string orchestra and is available on cd in a recording by the english northern philharmonia conducted by paul daniel
rita kempley writing in the washington post suggested it 's all rather arthurian with its chivalric hero on his spiritual quest the atmosphere suffused seeming to dance with once and future truths
tom hutchinson in the mail on sunday praised a script whose delight is in the rounded reality of its characters
janet maslin writing in the new york times praised o 'connor 's direction suggesting it lent the film a strong sense of yearning as well as a spiritual quality more apparent in the look of the film than in its dialogue
desmond ryan of the philadelphia inquirer wrote rarely has the impossibility of love been more wrenchingly presented than in the scenes of dashed hope between firth and richardson
however nigel andrews of the financial times found it like a pastoral parable that has been left outside in the damp too long causing its batteries to go flat and following a <year> screening sam jordison of the guardian suggested even though this film is unusually faithful to the book
it is really little better than inoffensive
somehow the magic that makes jl carr 's book so precious is missing
the film was the recipient of two awards pat o 'connor won the silver rosa camuna at the bergamo film meeting in <year> and howard blake was awarded the anthony asquith award for musical excellence by the british film institute in <year>
in addition colin firth was nominated for an evening standard award
the film was screened in the un certain regard section at the <year> cannes film festival
however when glyn watkins a poet who had been encouraged by j
l
carr early in his career wanted to screen the film at the launch of a poetry book in <year> at the national media museum in bradford the museum found that all original <num> film prints had disappeared
undeterred watkins contacted the agents of the cast and director and eventually the online fan clubs friends of firth and ken friends
he discovered that the film had appeared as part of the national film theatre 's branagh season in may <year> and that the film 's american distributors warner bros
had a print in a bonded warehouse
however it was unclear who possessed the rights to the film
only after several months it was found that channel <num> still owned the rights and the film was eventually released on a limited @-@ edition region <num> dvd in late <year>
however the dvd is now no longer widely available in the united kingdom
in <year> a complete <num> minute print was located in the academy film archive in los angeles and a campaign began to have it restored and released on dvd
a limited edition region a blu @-@ ray release of the full <num> minute version of the film is planned on <num> july <year>
it is a hydnoid species producing spores on the surface of vertical spines or tooth @-@ like projections that hang from the undersurface of the fruit bodies
it is found in north america europe and was recently discovered in iran <year> and korea <year>
hydnellum peckii is a mycorrhizal species and forms mutually beneficial relationships with a variety of coniferous trees growing on the ground singly scattered or in fused masses
the fruit bodies typically have a funnel @-@ shaped cap with a white edge although the shape can be highly variable
young moist fruit bodies can bleed a bright red fluid that contains a pigment known to have anticoagulant properties similar to heparin
the unusual appearance of the young fruit bodies has earned the species several descriptive common names including strawberries and cream the bleeding hydnellum the bleeding tooth fungus the red @-@ juice tooth and the devil 's tooth
although hydnellum peckii fruit bodies are readily identifiable when young they become brown and nondescript when they age
italian pier andrea saccardo placed the species in the genus hydnum in <year> while walter henry snell and esther amelia dick placed it in calodon in <year> hydnum peckii banker sacc
and calodon peckii snell e
a
dick are synonyms of hydnellum peckii
the fungus is classified in the stirps species thought to be descendants of a common ancestor diabolum of the genus hydnellum a grouping of similar species with the following shared characteristics flesh that is marked with concentric lines that form alternating pale and darker zones zonate an extremely peppery taste a sweetish odor spores that are ellipsoid and not amyloid that is not absorbing iodine when stained with melzer 's reagent acyanophilous not staining with the reagent cotton blue and covered with tubercules the presence of clamp connections in the hyphae
molecular analysis based on the sequences of the internal transcribed spacer dna of several hydnellum species placed h
peckii as most closely related to h
ferrugineum and h
spongiosipes
the specific epithet honors mycologist charles horton peck
the fungus is known in the vernacular by several names including strawberries and cream the bleeding hydnellum the red @-@ juice tooth peck 's hydnum the bleeding tooth fungus and the devil 's tooth
hydnellum peckii is a stipitate hydnoid fungus meaning that it has a cap atop a stipe stem and a form resembling a hydnum — characterized by a teeth @-@ like hymenium rather than gills or pores on the underside of the cap
fruit bodies growing closely together often appear to fuse together this is called confluence
they can reach a height of up to <num>
<num> cm <num>
<num> in
fresh fruit bodies exude a striking thick red fluid when they are moist
the cap 's surface is convex to flattened more or less uneven and sometimes slightly depressed in the center
it is usually densely covered with hairs that give it a texture similar to felt or velvet these hairs are sloughed off in age leaving the caps of mature specimens smooth
its shape varies from somewhat round to irregular <num> to <num> cm <num>
<num> to <num>
<num> in or even as much as <num> cm <num>
<num> in wide as a result of confluence
the cap is initially whitish but later turns slightly brownish with irregular dark @-@ brown to nearly black blotches where it is bruised
in maturity the surface is fibrous and tough scaly and jagged grayish @-@ brown in the upper part of the cap and somewhat woody
the flesh is a pale pinkish @-@ brown
the teeth are slender cylindrical and tapering terete less than <num> mm <num>
<num> in long and become shorter closer to the cap edge
they are crowded together with typically between three and five teeth per square millimeter
pinkish @-@ white initially they age to a grayish @-@ brown
the stem is thick very short and often deformed
it becomes bulbous where it penetrates the ground and may root into the soil for several centimeters
although it may reach up to <num> cm <num>
<num> in in total length and is <num> to <num> cm <num>
<num> to <num>
<num> in wide only about <num>
<num> to <num> cm <num>
<num> to <num>
<num> in appear above ground
the upper part is covered with the same teeth found on the underside of the cap whereas the lower part is hairy and often encases debris from the forest floor
the odor of the fruit body has been described as mild to disagreeable or as banker suggested in his original description similar to hickory nuts
viewing them with a light microscope reveals finer details of their structure they are roughly spherical but end abruptly in a small point their surfaces are covered with small wart @-@ like nodules and their size is between <num>
<num> – <num>
<num> by <num>
<num> – <num>
<num> µm
the spores are in amyloid meaning they do not absorb iodine when stained with melzer 's reagent
hydnellum peckii 's cells the hyphae also present various characters useful for its characterization
the hyphae that form the cap are hyaline translucent smooth thin @-@ walled and <num> – <num> µm thick
they collapse when dry but may be readily revived with a weak <num> solution of potassium hydroxide
those in the cap form an intricate tangle with a tendency to run longitudinally
they are divided into cellular compartments septa and have clamp connections — short branches connecting one cell to the previous cell to allow passage of the products of nuclear division
the basidia the spore @-@ bearing cells in the hymenium are club @-@ shaped four @-@ spored and measure <num> – <num> by <num>
<num> – <num> µm
peckii to be synonymous h
diabolus is said to have a sweetish pungent odor that is lacking in h
peckii
the differences between the two species are amplified in mature specimens h
diabolus has an irregularly thickened stem while the stem of h
peckii is thickened by a definite spongy layer
additionally old specimens of h
peckii have a smooth cap while h
diabolus is tomentose
the related species h
pineticola also exudes pink droplets of liquid when young and moist
commonly found growing under conifers in northeastern north america h
pineticola tastes unpleasant but not acrid
fruit bodies tend to grow singly rather than in fused clusters and unlike h
peckii they do not have bulbous stems
the subterranean hyphae of the fungus grow a sheath of tissue around the rootlets of a broad range of tree species in an intimate association that is especially beneficial to the host termed ectomycorrhizal as the fungus produces enzymes that mineralize organic compounds and facilitate the transfer of nutrients to the tree
the ectomycorrhizal structures of h
peckii are among a few in the bankeraceae that have been studied in detail
they are characterized by a plectenchymatous mantle — a layer of tissue made of hyphae tightly arranged in a parallel orientation or palisade and which rarely branch or overlap each other
these hyphae along with adhering mineral soil particles are embedded in a gelatinous matrix
the hyphae of the ectomycorrhizae can become chlamydospores an adaptation that helps the fungus tolerate unfavorable conditions
chlamydospores of h
peckii have a peculiar structure — markedly distinct from those of other bankeraceae — with thick smooth inner walls and an outer wall that is split radially into warts
the most striking characteristic of the ectomycorrhizae as a whole is the way the black outer layers of older sections are shed giving a carbonized appearance
the majority of the underground biomass of the fungus is concentrated near the surface most likely as mycelial mats — dense clusters of ectomycorrhizae and mycelium
the mycelium is also known to extend far beyond the site of the fruit bodies as far as <num> centimeters <num>
<num> ft away
molecular techniques have been developed to help with conservation efforts of stipitate hydnoid fungi including h
peckii
while the distribution of the fungus has traditionally been determined by counting the fruit bodies this method has a major drawback in that fruit bodies are not produced consistently every year and the absence of fruit bodies is not an indication of the absence of its mycelium in the soil
more modern techniques using the polymerase chain reaction to assess the presence of the fungal dna in the soil have helped alleviate the issues in monitoring the presence and distribution of fungi mycelia
h
peckii is a late @-@ stage fungus that in boreal forests dominated by jack pine typically begins associating with more mature hosts once the canopy has closed
a preference for mountainous or subalpine ecosystems has been noted
the fungus has a wide distribution in north america and is particularly common in the pacific northwest its range extends north to alaska and east to north carolina
in the puget sound area of the u
s
state of washington it is found in association with douglas @-@ fir fir and hemlock
along the oregon coast it has been collected under lodgepole pine
in addition to north america the mushroom is widespread in europe and its presence has been documented in italy germany and scotland
the species is common in the latter location but becoming increasingly rare in several european countries such as norway the netherlands and the czech republic
increased pollution in central europe has been suggested as one possible factor in the mushroom 's decline there
reports from iran in <year> and korea in <year> were the first outside europe and north america
peckii have been described as resembling danish pastry topped with strawberry jam and hydnellum species in general are not known to be poisonous they are inedible due to their extremely bitter taste
this acridity persists even in dried specimens
the fruit bodies of this and other hydnellum species are prized by mushroom dyers
the colors may range from beige when no mordant is used to various shades of blue or green depending on the mordant added
atromentin also possesses antibacterial activity inhibiting the enzyme enoyl @-@ acyl carrier protein reductase essential for the biosynthesis of fatty acids in the bacteria streptococcus pneumoniae
hydnellum peckii can bioaccumulate the heavy metal caesium
in one swedish field study as much as <num> of the total caesium of the topmost <num> cm <num>
<num> in of soil was found in the fungal mycelium
in general ectomycorrhizal fungi which grow most prolifically in the upper organic horizons of the soil or at the interface between the organic and mineral layers are involved in the retention and cycling of caesium @-@ <num> in organic @-@ rich forest soils
in tna he is the manager for former tna x division champion trevor lee
he is best known for his time with world wrestling entertainment wwe where he wrestled as the hurricane gregory helms and hurricane helms and also for his time with world championship wrestling wcw where he wrestled as sugar shane helms
helms first began wrestling in <year> at the age of <num> and wrestled in numerous independent promotions including the organization of modern extreme grappling arts winning numerous light heavyweight and tag team championships
in <year> he signed with wcw and gained fame as sugar shane helms a member of <num> count
during his time there he won both the wcw hardcore championship and the wcw cruiserweight championship
when wcw was bought by the world wrestling federation wwf now wwe helms contract was kept by wwf
helms renamed himself the hurricane and won the wwe cruiserweight championship
he later picked up a sidekick rosey and they won the world tag team championship together
he dropped the superhero gimmick in <year> and began wrestling under his real name
he once again won the cruiserweight championship in early <year> and held it for over a year becoming the longest reigning cruiserweight champion and the longest reigning champion of any kind in smackdown history
after being out of action for over a year after neck fusion surgery helms returned to smackdown in september <year> referring to himself as hurricane helms before moving to the ecw brand where he reverted to his gregory helms name and became the backstage interviewer
in mid @-@ <year> he brought back the hurricane character and appeared as both gregory helms and the hurricane on ecw
after ecw was cancelled helms was released by wwe on february <num> <year> and returned to the independent circuit
he won his first championship shortly afterwards by defeating playboy t
c
cruise to become the southern wrestling alliance swa light heavyweight champion
helms spent the majority of his early career in his home state of north carolina winning numerous light heavyweight championships
helms began calling himself the show shane helms and teamed with big daddy mike maverick initially using the team name assault and battery
they later dubbed themselves the serial thrillaz and won several independent tag championships
the pair also began wrestling in the organization of modern extreme grappling arts omega which was founded by the hardy boyz matt and jeff
the serial thrillaz won the omega tag team championship twice between <year> and <year> before they began competing for southern championship wrestling scw
they won the scw tag team championship and helms also won the scw heavyweight championship
scw would mark the end of the serial thrillaz as helms vacated both titles before moving on to nwa worldwide
once there helms joined the bad street boys with shannon moore christian york and joey matthews
in wcw helms along with moore and evan karagias formed the heel villainous stable faction <num> count and the trio debuted on the december <num> episode of wcw thunder
the trio was a parody of the boy bands n sync and the backstreet boys and their gimmick involved making music videos and performing songs before their matches
<num> count collectively won the wcw hardcore championship on wcw monday nitro in february <year>
this win made <num> count the first trio to win the hardcore championship
at uncensored brian knobbs defeated all members of <num> count to win the hardcore championship
during a match helms suffered a broken nose and was sidelined while he recovered
upon his return tank abbott had been added to the group as a fan and was utilized in an enforcer role
<num> count had a long @-@ running feud scripted rivalry with the jung dragons with the dragons attempting to steal <num> count 's fictional recording contract
this led to a ladder match between the two teams at new blood rising which <num> count won due to abbott 's interference
as a result abbott claimed that he should be the lead singer of <num> count and was kicked out by the other three members leading to a feud
<num> count later disbanded as moore and helms kicked karagias out of the group for attempting to steal the spotlight
at the same time the jung dragons turned on jamie noble who formed a team with karagias
the three teams met in a triangle match at mayhem which <num> count won
they also wrestled each other in a number one contendership ladder match at starrcade to earn a wcw cruiserweight championship match in which both moore and helms grabbed the contract at the same time
as a result they later wrestled for the opportunity to wrestle for the championship which helms won although he lost the subsequent championship match to chavo guerrero at the sin pay @-@ per @-@ view
moore and helms would leave wcw briefly in <year> to wrestle in nwa wildside where they held the wildside tag team championship for one day
helms became the number one contender for the cruiserweight championship after winning a match at superbrawl revenge but was attacked by karagias and moore afterwards
despite the attack helms would go on to defeat guerrero for the wcw cruiserweight championship at greed and was the reigning cruiserweight champion immediately before wcw was bought out by the world wrestling federation wwf
helms contract with wcw was one of twenty @-@ five that were included in wwf 's purchase of wcw
he was part of the invasion storyline as a member of the alliance losing his cruiserweight championship in a one @-@ on @-@ one match to another alliance member billy kidman
helms began wrestling as the hurricane on august <num> and also began wearing a superhero costume
that night he won the wwf european championship from matt hardy with help from ivory but lost it to bradshaw on october <num> <year>
in september <year> helms formed a tag team with lance storm who was now managed by ivory and helms later picked up a sidekick in molly holly who began to call herself mighty molly and the two came to the arena in a custom hurri @-@ cycle with molly in the sidecar
the team of helms and storm began feuds with teams like the hardy boyz and big show and spike dudley
helms and storm got a shot at the wcw tag team championship against the hardy boyz at no mercy in a losing effort
during <year> the hurricane won the wwf hardcore championship at wrestlemania x8 but molly betrayed him hitting him in the back of the head with a frying pan and defeating him for the championship
helms was later drafted to the smackdown brand following the brand extension and he won the cruiserweight championship from tajiri and billy kidman in a triple threat match
he lost it to jamie noble at king of the ring
later in <year> he was traded to raw won the world tag team championship with kane and held them for around a month in an alliance known as hurri @-@ kane
in backstage segments the rock referred to the hurricane as the hamburglar in part because his mask was similar to the hamburglar 's
the feud culminated in a match on raw in which the rock dominated
hurricane however was able to roll up the rock from behind after the rock was distracted by stone cold steve austin 's appearance on the ramp
in late <year> hurricane discovered rosey 's potential as a superhero and christened him rosey the super hero in training the s

on may <num> at backlash rosey and the hurricane defeated la résistance in the finals of a tag team turmoil match to win the world tag team championship
not long after winning the championship stacy keibler joined rosey and the hurricane as their sidekick super stacy
in august <year> rosey and the hurricane lost keibler as their sidekick when she and christy hemme were traded to the smackdown brand
on september <num> <year> hurricane and rosey were defeated by lance cade and trevor murdoch during cade and murdoch 's debut match on raw
as a result cade and murdoch earned a title match at the unforgiven pay @-@ per @-@ view
during the title match murdoch delivered an elevated ddt on the hurricane to the outside
the ddt caused hurricane to suffer a storyline stinger and allowed cade and murdoch to beat the injured hurricane later in the match to win the world tag team titles
during the next few weeks the pair began a losing streak mainly caused by hurricane 's on @-@ screen injuries
during the october <num> episode of raw the hurricane was assaulted by kurt angle at the request of vince mcmahon
after the beating footage was shown of the hurricane ripping off his mask and striking rosey because he did not help him fend off angle
the next week the hurricane no @-@ showed a world tag team title match leaving rosey to face the champions alone
during the match the hurricane out of costume appeared at the top of the entrance ramp reverting to his real name gregory helms and watched as rosey was double teamed and defeated
after the match helms announced that he was fed up with being funny for the crowd and that he was sick of carrying rosey as a tag team partner
this turned him into a heel in the process
on the november <num> episode of raw helms and rosey faced off in a singles match which helms won
subsequently helms wrestled mostly on raw 's sister show heat
on the january <num> <year> episode of raw helms confronted jerry lawler over jokes that lawler had been making at helms expense and lawler said that when helms was the hurricane he was entertaining and called helms a joke
helms responded by slapping lawler who hit helms back
this confrontation led to lawler defeating helms in a match at new year 's revolution
as a result he returned to the smackdown brand in february <year> to start a feud with nunzio kid kash and the other cruiserweights
during this time helms defeated nunzio in a one @-@ on @-@ one match
the next week he was supposed to defend against kid kash but kash was away on a family emergency so scotty <num> hotty took his place
helms defeated him and declared that he was better than all the other cruiserweights
as a result all the cruiserweights at the show invaded the ring and attacked helms
it was later announced by smackdown general manager theodore long that at the no way out pay @-@ per @-@ view event helms would face all the cruiserweights in a match for the title
helms was able to retain the championship
later long mandated that helms had to defend his title against a cruiserweight each week on smackdown to prove that he truly was better than all the cruiserweights

its southern terminus is at an intersection with ny <num> in the town of owego in tioga county
the northern terminus is at a junction with ny 104a in the town of sterling in cayuga county
ny <num> is a two @-@ lane local road for most of its length
the route is the main access road to parts of auburn dryden newark valley and port byron
it passes through mountainous terrain in tioga and cortland counties but the terrain levels out as it heads through the finger lakes area and cayuga county
the route intersects several long @-@ distance highways including ny <num> in dryden u
s
route <num> us <num> and ny <num> in auburn and ny <num> in port byron
it passes over the new york state thruway interstate <num> or i @-@ <num> north of port byron however there is no connection between the two
ny <num> has two suffixed routes
the first ny 38a is an alternate route of ny <num> between moravia and auburn while the other ny 38b is a simple east – west connector in the southern tier
while ny <num> runs along the western shore of owasco lake ny 38a travels to auburn along a routing east of the lake
ny <num> passes along or near waterbodies for much of its length
from its southern end in owego to the town of harford the route parallels owego creek or a branch of said creek
between groton and mentz it runs along the aforementioned owasco lake and its inlet south of the lake and outlet north of the lake
it also comes within <num> miles <num> km of lake ontario at its northern end
in the <num> the portion of ny <num> between owego and freeville was designated as new york state route <num> while the segment from freeville to moravia was the southern part of new york state route <num> a highway that continued north from moravia to syracuse
ny <num> was assigned as part of the <year> renumbering of state highways in new york utilizing all of pre @-@ <year> ny <num> the freeville – moravia portion of ny <num> and a previously unnumbered highway north to sterling
originally ny <num> extended south into the village of owego by way of an overlap with ny <num>
it was truncated to its current southern terminus by <year>
in auburn the route is city @-@ maintained to the north and south of where the route meets us <num> and ny <num> in downtown auburn
the portion of ny <num> that runs between and overlaps with those two routes is state @-@ maintained
<num> miles <num>
<num> km north of the owego village limits in the town of owego
the road heads northeastward as a two @-@ lane highway paralleling owego creek as it proceeds along the base of a valley surrounding the waterway
the tioga county portion of ny <num> passes through mostly rural forested areas with only small scattered pockets of development
the route continues toward the hamlet of flemingville where the owego creek splits into western and eastern branches
ny <num> does not enter the community instead it bypasses it to the southeast and follows the eastern branch of owego creek into the town of newark valley
the amount of homes along the route begins to increase as ny <num> approaches the village of newark valley
just south of the village limits ny <num> intersects ny 38b a spur leading to ny <num> in maine
the route continues into the small village as south main street and passes by several blocks of homes and commercial buildings
at water street ny <num> becomes north main street however from this point north most of the village is situated on the opposite bank of owego creek
as a result ny <num> continues through the village limits but passes very few buildings before seamlessly exiting the community and entering another rural area
the route continues on crossing over owego creek and passing the newark valley country club about <num> mile <num>
<num> km north of newark valley village before entering the town of berkshire
in berkshire ny <num> serves the hamlet of berkshire a small community situated directly on the highway
the route continues on through the narrowing creek valley into the town of richford and the hamlet of the same name where it meets ny <num> in the community 's center
after richford the valley continues to narrow for just under <num>
<num> miles <num>
<num> km before reversing course as the route heads into cortland county and the town of harford
ny <num> clips the extreme southwestern corner of cortland county as a result only <num>
<num> miles <num>
<num> km of the route is located within the county
just north of the county line the route meets ny <num> in the hamlet of harford mills
ny <num> is little more than an alternate route to ny <num> which ny <num> meets in the hamlet of harford <num>
<num> miles <num>
<num> km to the northeast
in between harford mills and harford the east branch of owego creek separates from ny <num> and heads north to follow ny <num> instead
ny <num> continues northwest out of harford hamlet and into tompkins county
the highway gradually curves to the north toward the village of dryden where the route changes names to south street upon entering the village limits
it continues north across virgil creek and past three blocks of homes to the commercial village center where it intersects both ny <num> and ny <num>
the latter begins here and heads off to the east while the former joins ny <num> along north street
the overlap between ny <num> and ny <num> ends at the northern village line
at this point ny <num> continues north while ny <num> forks to the west running along the village limits on freeville road for about <num> mile <num>
<num> km through an area with only a handful of homes
while doing so the route passes to the south of the dryden middle and high school complex
ny <num> heads onward through an open undeveloped area curving to the northwest and eventually to the north as it approaches the village of freeville where it serves the william george agency for children 's services at the southern village line
it remains on freeville road until railroad street where it turns west and proceeds into the densely populated village center
here it intersects the eastern terminus of ny <num> at a junction situated adjacent to fall creek
ny <num> proceeds out of freeville passing over fall creek and heading north along groton road through a lightly populated area of the town of dryden
the route passes by a mixture of open fields forests and isolated homes on its way to the dryden – groton town line where it meets the southern terminus of ny 34b southeast of the hamlet of peruville
ny <num> parallels the owasco inlet into groton and the village of the same name becoming peru road at the southern village line
it continues north following south and main streets through the densely populated village to an intersection with ny <num> 's western terminus at cortland street
at this point ny <num> becomes cayuga street and winds its way northward along the owasco inlet and out of the village
now known as locke road ny <num> heads the northwest through another rural largely undeveloped area into cayuga county
most of the county is only about <num> miles <num> km wide from its western border to its eastern edge
from north to south however it extends from locke north to the lake ontario shoreline — a distance of about <num> miles <num> km
ny <num> passes through much of the county ending about <num> miles <num> km south of the shoreline in sterling
as a result over half of ny <num> 's routing is located in the county with the midpoint located near the city of auburn
ny <num> heads north – south through the residential community as main street and intersects ny <num> at the center of the hamlet
north of the community the highway crosses over the owasco inlet and enters another rural area dominated by fields situated amongst forests
upon crossing into the town of moravia the amount of development along the highway increases as it passes fillmore glen state park and approaches the village of moravia
in moravia a highly developed village comprising several blocks of homes and businesses ny <num> is known as main street as it heads north into the village center
at cayuga street ny <num> intersects ny 38a the second of its two suffixed routes
ny 38a heads eastward from this point while ny <num> turns to follow west cayuga street across owasco inlet and out of the village
past the inlet ny <num> curves to the north and runs along the western edge of the owasco flats a wide flat @-@ bottomed undeveloped valley at the foot of owasco lake
the flats give way to the lake in cascade a hamlet in the town of venice at which point ny <num> begins to climb up the western edge of the lake valley
it reaches the lip of the valley <num> miles <num>
<num> km later in the town of scipio
for the next <num>
<num> miles <num>
<num> km the route passes by open fields as it overlooks the lake to the east
the route gradually descends back into the valley as it heads further northward into the town of fleming
once in fleming ny <num> runs along the lakeshore and serves a long line of lakeside homes as it passes by a series of fields to the west
the amount of development along the route begins to increase at the northern end of the lake in the hamlet of melrose park where ny <num> meets ny <num> by way of a traffic circle
at this point ny <num> becomes the primary lakeside highway while ny <num> becomes a four @-@ lane divided highway and heads northwest as lake avenue toward the city of auburn
as ny <num> enters auburn it passes by auburn high school before heading north through densely populated blocks filled with homes
the divided highway ends abruptly at swift street where ny <num> turns west to follow the two @-@ lane undivided swift street west for seven blocks to ny <num> south street
here ny <num> leaves swift street and joins ny <num> on south street
the two routes follow south street past the william h
seward house into downtown auburn where the homes are replaced with businesses at lincoln street
three blocks later south street intersects with the east arterial eastbound us <num> and ny <num>
the overlap between ny <num> and ny <num> ends one block later at the west arterial westbound us <num> and ny <num> where ny <num> turns to follow the arterial for a block to the west
at state street ny <num> leaves us <num> and ny <num> and heads north through the city 's north side crossing the owasco outlet and serving the auburn correctional facility
the route passes through several blocks of commercial and residential development up to grant street where it begins to taper off
it ceases almost entirely near the northern city line at york street where the homes along the highway become more sporadic and spaced apart
within throop it serves the small hamlet of sawyers corners where ny <num> meets turnpike road county route 10b or cr 10b
north of this junction the houses give way to dense forests as the route continues along the waterway into the town of mentz and the village of port byron a short distance north of the town line
it follows main street through a mostly commercial and industrial portion of the village to the village center where it intersects ny <num> at rochester and utica streets
ny <num> turns west overlapping ny <num> along rochester street
the two routes cross the owasco outlet and enter a more residential area of the community where ny <num> splits from ny <num> and continues north along canal street
the route crosses over the new york state thruway i @-@ <num> as it leaves the village limits and heads north into a largely undeveloped area of forests and fields
at north port byron a sparsely populated hamlet <num>
<num> miles <num>
<num> km north of port byron ny <num> passes over the csx transportation @-@ owned rochester subdivision railroad line
the highway continues on becoming conquest road and crossing the seneca river erie canal at mosquito point near where owasco outlet flows into the river
ny <num> enters the town of conquest upon traversing the waterway
ny <num> continues north as an unnamed highway to the hamlet of conquest a small community built up around the intersection of ny <num> and fuller and slayton roads
it continues on into the town of victory where the undeveloped fields give way to cultivated fields used as farmland
the route heads through mostly desolate surroundings to the hamlet of victory a slightly larger community centered on ny <num>
the route proceeds through the hamlet passing by several homes on its way to a junction with ny <num> just north of the community
past this point the homes cease again as ny <num> presses on through more fields and forests to the town of sterling
just north of the town line in the small hamlet of north victory ny <num> intersects ny <num>
past this point the route heads through mostly undeveloped forested areas on its way to the hamlet of finches corners
north of here the forests cede slightly as the amount of fields along the highway increases
the highway continues on to the hamlet of sterling where it ends at an intersection with ny 104a the seaway trail just south of the hamlet 's center and <num> miles <num> km south of the lake ontario shoreline
on april <num> <year> the new york state legislature passed a law incorporating the cortland and owego turnpike company
the company was tasked with building a highway — the cortland and owego turnpike — from owego north to the then @-@ village of cortland
it roughly followed what is now ny <num> north from owego to the vicinity of harford where it turned north to access virgil
it continued to cortland by way of modern ny <num>
on april <num> <year> the legislature chartered the auburn and port byron turnpike company
the auburn and port byron turnpike began at the auburn state prison in auburn and proceeded northward along the routing of ny <num> to meet the north branch of the seneca turnpike in the town of brutus now throop
from there the turnpike continued on ny <num> through port byron to the seneca river where it ended at a bridge crossing the river at mosquito point
in <year> the auburn and moravia plank road company was incorporated
they were tasked with connecting moravia to auburn by way of a plank road along the western side of owasco lake now ny <num>
by <year> the segment of current ny <num> between freeville and owego was designated as ny <num>
in the <year> renumbering of state highways in new york the entirety of ny <num> and the portion of ny <num> south of moravia was incorporated into the new ny <num> which extended north from moravia to ny <num> modern ny 104a in sterling
the section of the route adjacent to owasco lake was still being constructed at the time of ny <num> 's assignment it was completed c
<year>
ny <num> originally overlapped with ny <num> designated as ny <num> in <year> through owego to a terminus at the modern junction of ny <num> and ny <num> south of the village
the overlap was extended slightly along southside drive to ny <num> exit <num> in the <num> following the construction of the southern tier expressway through the area
it was removed altogether when ny <num> was truncated to the northern end of the overlap by <year>
<num> miles or <num>
<num> kilometres runs from moravia to ny <num> near mandana and ny 41a in southwestern onondaga county and then towards auburn
it was assigned as part of the <year> renumbering of state highways in new york
ny 38b <num>
<num> miles or <num>
<num> kilometres is a short spur in broome and tioga counties connecting ny <num> in newark valley in the west to ny <num> in maine in the east
it was assigned in the early <num>
several scots also attended and the assembly 's work was adopted by the church of scotland
as many as <num> ministers were called to the assembly with nineteen others added later to replace those who did not attend or could no longer attend
it produced a new form of church government a confession of faith or statement of belief two catechisms or manuals for religious instruction shorter and larger and a liturgical manual the directory for public worship for the churches of england and scotland
the confession and catechisms were adopted as doctrinal standards in the church of scotland and other presbyterian churches where they remain normative
amended versions of the confession were also adopted in congregational and baptist churches in england and new england in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries
the confession became influential throughout the english @-@ speaking world but especially in american protestant theology
the assembly was called by the long parliament before and during the beginning of the first english civil war
the long parliament was influenced by puritanism a religious movement which sought to further reform the church
they were opposed to the religious policies of king charles i and william laud archbishop of canterbury
as part of a military alliance with scotland parliament agreed that the outcome of the assembly would bring the english church into closer conformity with the church of scotland
the scottish church was governed by a system of elected assemblies of elders called presbyterianism rather than rule by bishops called episcopalianism which was used in the english church
scottish commissioners attended and advised the assembly as part of the agreement
disagreements over church government caused open division in the assembly despite attempts to maintain unity
the party of divines who favoured presbyterianism was in the majority but political and military realities led to greater influence for the congregationalist party
congregationalists favoured autonomy for individual congregations rather than the subjection of congregations to regional and national assemblies entailed in presbyterianism
parliament eventually adopted a presbyterian form of government but it lacked the power the presbyterian divines desired
during the restoration of the monarchy in <year> all of the documents of the assembly were repudiated and episcopal church government was reinstated in england
the assembly worked in the reformed protestant theological tradition also known as calvinism
it took the bible as the authoritative word of god from which all theological reflection must be based
the divines were committed to the reformed doctrine of predestination — that god chooses certain men to be saved and enjoy eternal life rather than eternal punishment
there was some disagreement at the assembly over the doctrine of particular redemption — that christ died only for those chosen for salvation
the assembly also held to reformed covenant theology a framework for interpreting the bible
the assembly 's confession is the first of the reformed confessions to teach a doctrine called the covenant of works which teaches that before the fall of man god promised eternal life to adam on condition that he perfectly obeyed god
puritans could be distinguished by their insistence that worship practices be supported implicitly or explicitly by the bible while their opponents gave greater authority to traditional customs
they believed the church of england which had separated itself from the catholic church during the english reformation was still too heavily influenced by catholicism
they sought to rid the church and nation of any of these remaining influences
this included the church 's episcopal polity or rule by a hierarchy of bishops
puritans unlike separatists did not leave the established church
under charles the puritans opponents were placed in high positions of authority most notably william laud who was made archbishop of canterbury in <year> even though these high churchmen were in the minority
puritans were forced to keep their views private or face fines and imprisonment
laud promoted advocates of arminianism a theological perspective opposed to the reformed theology of the puritans
worship practices such as kneeling at communion bowing at the name of christ and the placement of communion tables at the east end of churches were also reinstated
to the puritans these seemed to be a step in the direction of catholicism
there were also conflicts between the king and the scots whose church was ruled by a system of elected assemblies called presbyterianism
james charles 's predecessor as king of scotland made it clear that he intended to impose elements of episcopal church government and the book of common prayer on the scots beginning in <year>
the scots considered this a reversion to roman catholicism
charles furthered english impositions on the church of scotland in <year> and <year>
this led to the first bishops war between charles and the scots in <year>
charles called what came to be known as the short parliament to raise funds for the war but he soon dissolved it when it began voicing opposition to his policies
following the second bishops war with the scots in <year> charles was forced to call another parliament to raise additional funds
what came to be known as the long parliament also began to voice vague grievances against charles many of which were religious in nature
parliament had many puritans and puritan @-@ sympathizing members who generally opposed the existing episcopal system but there was little agreement over what shape the church should take
later in <year> the root and branch petition was presented to the house of commons the lower house of parliament
it was signed by about <num> @,@ <num> londoners and called for total elimination of the episcopal system
committees were organized in the house of commons to enact religious reforms leading to the imprisonment of archbishop laud and his supporters in the tower of london as retaliation for their repression of puritans
the court of high commission and the star chamber courts which had inflicted severe punishments on puritan dissenters were also abolished
such a proposal was also included in the grand remonstrance a list of grievances which parliament presented to charles on <num> december that year
charles responded on <num> december that the church required no reforms
undeterred parliament passed three bills in <year> appointing an assembly and stipulating that its members would be chosen by parliament
charles whose royal assent was required for the bills to become law was only willing to consider such an assembly if the members were chosen by the clergy
this was the practice for selection of members of convocation the assembly of clergy of the church of england
defying the king between <num> february and <num> april <year> each county delegation of england in commons chose two divines in addition to two for each county of wales four for london and two for each university oxford and cambridge
county delegations often chose divines from their own county but not always
commons chose the members in this way to ensure that their local constituencies were represented in the decision
the house of lords parliament 's upper house added another fourteen names on <num> may to which commons agreed
meanwhile relations continued to deteriorate between the king and parliament
charles raised the royal standard at nottingham on <num> august marking the beginning of the first english civil war
the start of the war lent support to the cause of the assembly in parliament because holding it would convince the scots that parliament was serious about reforming the church and induce the scots to come to their aid
on the other hand the war added strain to the already busy parliament
parliament finally passed an ordinance to hold the assembly on its own authority without charles 's assent on <num> june <year>
it named as many as <num> ministers and thirty non @-@ voting parliamentary observers twenty from commons and ten from the house of lords
the assembly was almost entirely english parliament appointed englishmen for the counties of wales but the french stranger churches churches of protestant refugees from catholic france sent two ministers in place of any from the channel islands
many of the divines were internationally recognized scholars of the bible ancient languages patristics and scholastic theology
many were also famous preachers
most of these theologians had retained their positions in the church during the tenure of william laud
some had been ejected from their churches or cited by ecclesiastical courts for their views
some had fled to the continent and one to the american colonies
nonetheless they all considered themselves members of the church of england and had received episcopal ordination
most were conformists meaning they agreed to follow the act of uniformity <year> and the book of common prayer
the assembly was strictly under the control of parliament and was only to debate topics which parliament directed
assembly members were not permitted to state their disagreements with majority opinions or share any information about the proceedings except in writing to parliament
parliament chose william twisse an internationally respected theologian to be the assembly 's prolocutor or chairman
due to twisse 's ill health cornelius burges whom parliament appointed as one of several assessors served as prolocutor pro tempore for most of the assembly
twenty @-@ two appointed members of the assembly died before <year> and they along with those who did not attend for other reasons were replaced by another nineteen members
three non @-@ voting scribes were also added in <year>
the nave was so full that the house of commons had to send members ahead to secure seats
following the sermon the divines processed to the henry vii chapel which would be their place of meeting until <num> october when they moved to the warmer and more private jerusalem chamber
after their initial meeting they adjourned for about a week as parliament had not yet given specific instructions
on <num> july they received a set of rules from parliament and were ordered to examine the first ten of the thirty @-@ nine articles the current doctrinal standard of the church of england and to free and vindicate the doctrine of them from all aspersions of false interpretations
after a day of fasting the assembly took a vow as directed by parliament to not maintain any thing in matters of doctrine but what i think in my conscience to be truth
the divines organized themselves into three standing committees though each committee was open to any member of the assembly
the committees would be assigned topics and prepare propositions for debate in the full assembly following each morning of committee meetings
in addition over <num> ad hoc committees were appointed for tasks such as examination of candidate preachers college fellows and suspected heretics
the assembly resolved after some debate that all the doctrines of the thirty @-@ nine articles would need to be proven from the bible
assembly members were prone to long speeches and they made slow progress frustrating the leadership
the eighth of the thirty @-@ nine articles recommended the apostles creed nicene creed and athanasian creed considered to be basic statements of orthodoxy to be received and believed
the assembly was unable to resolve conflicts between those who would not be bound by creeds and those who wished to retain the existing language that the creeds be thoroughly received and believed
the excepters who took the former position argued that the articles only require the matter of the creeds be believed
on <num> august the article was put off until the rest of the articles could be dealt with
this early disagreement on fundamental issues revealed deep rifts between different factions of the assembly
in return for a military alliance the scottish parliament required the english to sign the solemn league and covenant in <year> which stipulated that the english would bring their church into greater conformity with the church of scotland
the scottish parliament sent commissioners to london to represent scotland 's interests to the english parliament
eleven of these four theologians and seven members of parliament were also invited to the assembly
the commissioners were given the opportunity to become full voting members of the assembly but declined preferring to maintain their independence as commissioners of their own nation and church
samuel rutherford george gillespie and alexander henderson were the most outspoken of the commissioners
on <num> october <year> parliament ordered the assembly to cease work on the thirty @-@ nine articles and to begin to frame a common form of church government for the two nations
the assembly would spend a quarter of its full sessions on the subject of church government
the majority of the assembly members supported presbyterian polity or church government by elected assemblies of lay and clerical representatives though many were not dogmatically committed to it
several members of this group numbering about twenty and including william twisse favoured a primitive episcopacy which would include elements of presbyterianism and a reduced role for bishops
there were also several congregationalists who favoured autonomy for individual local churches
their most influential divines were thomas goodwin philip nye sidrach simpson jeremiah burroughs and william bridge
they were often called the dissenting brethren in the assembly
they have sometimes been labelled independents but they rejected this term
the assembly members for the most part reserved the label independent for separatists who left the established church
the congregationalist divines cannot be equated with separatists and brownists as they had accepted episcopal ordination and remained in the church of england
their influence was assisted by the success of oliver cromwell and his new model army in the ongoing civil war
cromwell and many others in the army supported congregationalism
a third group of divines were known as erastians a term for those who believed that the state should have significant power over the church
the entire assembly was erastian in the sense that the body had been called by parliament and was completely under state control
those labelled erastian at the assembly believed the civil authority rather than church officers should hold the power of church discipline
this included the power to withhold communion from unrepentant sinners
they did not see any particular form of church government as divinely mandated and because of this the dissenting brethren allied with them when it became clear that a presbyterian establishment would be much less tolerant of congregationalism than parliament
there were only two divines at the assembly who held the erastian view john lightfoot and thomas coleman but the presence of members of parliament especially john selden as well as the fact of parliamentary oversight of the assembly gave erastian views disproportional influence
several episcopalians supporters of the existing system of bishops were also included in the summoning ordinance but parliament may have nominated them to lend greater legitimacy to the assembly and not have expected them to attend because charles had not approved of the assembly
only one daniel featley participated and he only until his arrest for treason in october <year>
debate on church officers began on <num> october
the assembly began with the issue of ordination as many of the divines were concerned about the rise of various sectarian movements and the lack of any mechanism for ordination of ministers of the established church
while some members did not seem to think ordination necessary for preachers though they should not administer the sacraments without it a majority of the divines thought any regular preaching without ordination unacceptable and wished to erect a provisional presbytery for purposes of ordination
there was also debate at this early stage over the nature of the visible church
the congregationalists considered a church to be a single local congregation while the majority considered the national church to be a unity and were alarmed at the prospect of a disintegrated english church
despite these debates up until the end of <year> there was hope that a common church government could be framed that would be satisfactory to all parties involved
on <num> or <num> january <year> the five leading dissenting brethren signalled a break with the rest of the assembly when they published an apologeticall narration a polemical pamphlet appealing to parliament
it argued that the congregational system was more amenable to state control of religious matters than that of the presbyterians because they did not desire the church to retain any real power except to withdraw fellowship from aberrant congregations
by <num> january the majority of the assembly had become convinced that the best way forward was a presbyterian system similar to that of the scots but the dissenting brethren were allowed to continue to state their case in hope that they could eventually be reconciled
it was hoped that by avoiding asserting that presbyterianism was established by divine right the congregationalists could be accommodated
despite these efforts on <num> february it became clear just how fundamentally opposed the groups were
philip nye one of the dissenting brethren asserted in a speech that a presbytery set over local congregations would become as powerful as the state and was dangerous to the commonwealth provoking vigorous opposition from presbyterians
the next day the assembly finally began to establish a prescription for presbyterian government
owing to a strong belief in the unity of the church the assembly continued to try to find ways to reconcile the dissenting brethren with the majority throughout <year> including the establishment of a special committee for that purpose in march
however on <num> november the dissenting brethren presented their reasons for disagreement with the rest of the assembly to parliament and on <num> december the majority submitted a draft of a presbyterian form of government
while members of parliament agreed that the sacrament should be kept pure many of them disagreed with the presbyterian majority in the assembly over who had the final power of excommunication taking the erastian view that it was the state
also by <year> oliver cromwell 's new model army had won the war on behalf of parliament
cromwell along with a majority of the army was strongly in favour of religious toleration for all sorts of christians even if the national church was to be presbyterian
his rise to power as a result of his military victories made the idea of a strictly presbyterian settlement without freedom of worship for others very unlikely
parliament at least wanted to know which sins in particular were grave enough to trigger excommunication by the church the assembly was reticent to provide such information as the majority considered the power of the church in this area to be absolute
in may <year> parliament passed an ordinance allowing excommunicants to appeal the church 's sentences to parliament
another ordinance on <num> october contained a list of sins to which the church would be limited in its power to excommunicate
to the majority of the divines dismay an even more erastian ordinance was proposed in march <year>
the assembly published a protest provoking the commons to charge it with breach of privilege and to submit nine questions to the divines on the matter
votes were to be included with the answers an attempt to force the divines associated with the protest petition to reveal themselves
the nine queries as they came to be called focused on the divine right jure divino of church government
while the presbyterian divines were capable of defending their vision for church government as established by divine right in the bible they were unwilling to answer the queries because doing so would further expose the disunity of the assembly and weaken their case in parliament
in july <year> the new model army invaded london and conservative members of parliament were forced out
parliament passed an ordinance establishing religious tolerance and ensuring that the assembly 's vision of a national compulsory presbyterian church would never come to fruition
in london where support for presbyterianism was greatest presbyteries were established in only sixty @-@ four of <num> city parishes and regional presbyterian classes were only formed in fourteen of england 's forty counties
a planned national general assembly never met
many presbyterians did however establish voluntary presbyteries in what was a de facto free church situation until the restoration in <year> when a compulsory episcopal system was reinstated
the new form of government was much more acceptable to the general assembly of the church of scotland
they passed it on <num> february <year> contingent on some particularities of presbyterian government which were expected to be worked out in a forthcoming directory for church government
at the same time they announced their desire to formally unite the two churches
following the rise of cromwell and the secret engagement of some scots with charles this hope was abandoned and the documents were never formally adopted
the general assembly ceased to function under cromwell and the kings who succeeded him from <year> to <year>
the directory for public worship which was to replace the book of common prayer was swiftly written in <year> and passed by parliament on <num> january <year>
the directory accepted by the scots as well took a middle course between the presbyterians and congregationalists
the presbyterians for the most part preferred a fixed liturgy while congregationalists favoured extemporaneous prayer
the directory consisted of an order for services with sample prayers
the assembly also recommended a psalter translated by francis rous for use in worship
a confession of faith to replace the thirty @-@ nine articles was begun in august <year>
while there is little record of the actions of the assembly during the writing of the confession it is clear that there were significant debates in the assembly over almost every doctrine found in it
the confession was printed and sent to parliament in december
the house of commons requested scripture citations be added to the confession which were provided in april <year>
parliament approved the confession with revisions to the chapters on church censures synods and councils and marriage on <num> june <year>
the general assembly of the church of scotland had already adopted the confession without revision in <year>
the restoration of charles ii in <year> effectively made this legislation a nullity
the assembly had already done significant work on a catechism between december <year> and january <year> containing fifty @-@ five questions before it decided to create two catechisms rather than one
the larger catechism intended to assist ministers in teaching the reformed faith to their congregations
the shorter catechism was based on the larger catechism but intended for use in teaching the faith to children
parliament demanded scripture proofs for the catechisms as well
the scots general assembly approved both catechisms in <year>
the assembly understood its mandate under the solemn league and covenant to have been fulfilled on <num> april <year> when it delivered the scripture citations to parliament and the scottish commissioners had already left by the end of <year>
the assembly continued to meet primarily for the purpose of examination of ministers for ordination
most of the divines were unhappy with the republican commonwealth that emerged after colonel pride 's purge of the long parliament in <year>
as a result a majority stopped attending rather than agree to the oath of engagement to the commonwealth that was imposed in <year>
newspapers continued to report on the meetings of the assembly as late as march <year>
the assembly must have stopped meeting sometime between then and cromwell 's dissolution of the rump parliament on <num> april <year>
the divines also considered themselves to be within the broader european reformed tradition
they were in frequent correspondence with continental reformed theologians and sought their approval
they also drew upon the pre @-@ reformation british theological tradition which emphasized biblical knowledge and was influenced by the augustinian theological tradition exemplified by anselm thomas bradwardine and john wycliffe
the recorded debates of the assembly are full of citations of church fathers and medieval scholastic theologians
the confession starts with the doctrine of revelation or how people can know about god
the divines believed knowledge of god was available to people through nature as well as the bible but they also believed that the bible or scripture is the only way in which people attain saving knowledge of god
the doctrine of scripture was also a particularly important area of debate at the time
scholars had begun to argue that the hebrew vowel points marks added to the text to aid in pronunciation of the old testament were probably not part of the original
this caused significant debate between reformed polemicists and roman catholics
catholics argued that such a discovery demonstrated the need for an authoritative magisterium to interpret the bible as opposed to the protestant doctrine of perspicuity that the essential teachings of the bible could be interpreted by anyone
english reformed writers in particular took up the work of defending the reformed doctrine
the divines had a strong view of the inspiration of the bible and believed that god revealed himself in the propositions found in scripture
while the issue of biblical inerrancy the belief that there are no errors in the bible did not arise until the eighteenth century the divines clearly did not believe the bible to contain any errors
many of the divines held a rather mechanical view of biblical inspiration believing that not only the words and ideas but also the letters and vowel points of the hebrew text were inspired by god
on the other hand they acknowledged that the text was written by humans in their own styles
they did not make any distinction between essential and incidental matters with respect to biblical inspiration
puritans believed that god is sovereign over all of history and nature and that none of what were called his decrees would be frustrated
there was significant debate in the assembly over the relationship of god 's decree of predestination or choice to save some people to the redemption purchased by christ 's death
many of the reformed during this period taught that christ died with the purpose only to save those who were eternally chosen to be saved a doctrine called particular redemption
a vocal minority of the divines of the assembly argued for a position known as hypothetical universalism
edmund calamy held such a view and he argued that christ 's death as well as saving those who had been chosen offered salvation to all people on condition that they believe
the assembly 's confession did not teach such a view and its language is much more amenable to a particular redemption interpretation but there is a general agreement among scholars that the confession 's language allows an hypothetical universalist interpretation
covenant theology is an interpretive framework used by reformed theologians which was significantly developed during the seventeenth century
under this scheme as articulated by the assembly god 's dealings with men are described in terms of two covenants the covenant of works and covenant of grace
the westminster confession was the first major reformed symbol to explicitly mention the covenant of works sometimes called the covenant of life in which god offered adam eternal life on condition of perfect obedience
in the fall of man adam broke the covenant of works by eating of the tree of knowledge of good and evil
to remedy this god offered salvation apart from human initiative in what was called the covenant of grace
this covenant allowed man to enjoy eternal life despite his inability to obey god 's law perfectly
the idea of the covenant of grace was a much more common feature of orthodox reformed theology
the westminster divines set these two covenants against each other as the two major ways in which god deals with people
the divines were even more strongly opposed to catholicism than to william laud and his followers the laudians
they associated both catholicism and laudianism with arminianism and persecution
before the civil war the divines saw these two groups as the greatest threat to the church
with the rise of radical sectarian movements during the war the divines became much more concerned with these groups than polemics against catholicism
the divines were particularly concerned with those they labeled antinomians
this was a loose term for those who saw the moral law as in some way no longer relevant for christians
the divines saw these groups as more immediately threatening than catholicism
the act of uniformity <year> a law requiring even greater adherence to the book of common prayer and support for episcopalianism than had previously been required forced puritan ministers to leave the church
though some presbyterians continued to desire to be readmitted to the established church restrictions on worship for non @-@ conformists led to presbyterians putting aside differences with congregationalists and adopting congregational church orders
the civil war brought with it the end of the consensus among english protestants that there should be a single church imposed by the state though there was still not complete freedom of religion
the ideals of the dissenting brethren of the assembly were significant in the rise of denominationalism the doctrine that the church is found in several institutions rather than a single one in a given location
though protestants already commonly recognized the validity of churches in different territories the outcome of the assembly 's debates marks the wider acceptance of the idea that several true churches may be found in the same territory
the confession produced by the assembly was adopted with amendments by congregationalists in england in the form of the <year> savoy declaration as well as by particular baptists in the form of the <year> baptist confession
when the general assembly of the church of scotland was reestablished in <year> following the glorious revolution it ratified the westminster confession but not any other document produced at westminster
the confession remains according to the <year> declaratory articles the church of scotland 's principal subordinate standard subordinate to the bible
memorization of the shorter catechism has been made a requirement for children in many presbyterian churches
the migrations and missionary efforts of each of these groups lead to the widespread significance of the westminster assembly throughout the english @-@ speaking world
the assembly 's confession was particularly influential in american protestant theology
it was included with congregationalist changes as part of the <year> cambridge platform a statement produced by ministers of colonial massachusetts and the surrounding region and again in colonial connecticut as part of the <year> saybrook platform
the confession was modified for american baptists in the <year> philadelphia confession
the adopting act of <year> required american presbyterians to agree to the theology of the assembly 's confession and the confession remains a part of the presbyterian church usa s book of confessions
the confession has been called by far the most influential doctrinal symbol in american protestant history by the historian of religion sydney e

in the puzzle protagonist george stobbart must gain access to an underground dig located in a castle in lochmarne ireland by avoiding getting butted by a fierce goat
it is often explained to be difficult due to challenging the player in a way different from previous puzzles in the game
it is also noted by many gamers and various publications as one of the hardest video game puzzles of all time
the puzzle was simplified in the shadow of the templars <year> director 's cut
while investigating a murder protagonist and player character george stobbart finds himself uncovering a dark mystery regarding the knights templar
a medieval manuscript which he obtained during the investigation leads him to a castle located in lochmarne ireland
as he cannot enter the castle through the main entrance door he climbs a haystack which stops short of the top of the wall
he puts a sewer key which he obtained at the beginning of the game in a crack in the wall which forms a step allowing him to climb over the wall
inside the castle an entrance to an underground dig is located
a tied @-@ up goat is sitting near the entrance however the chain to which it is tied is long enough to allow it to prevent george from reaching the entrance by butting him
an old piece of farming machinery is located at the left side of the screen but george is unable to interact with it as the goat continues to butt him
george must allow the goat to butt him when trying to reach the entrance but while the goat is returning to its original position the player must click on the farming machinery which causes george to quickly jump up and run to the machinery and slightly reposition it
when returned to its original position the goat again charges and butts george but while doing so gets its chain entangled with the machinery due to its repositioning
this allows george to move freely and enter the dig
broken sword creator and revolution ceo charles cecil and broken sword designer steve ince as well as publications which have covered it explain that the puzzle was challenging because the player was not met with any time critical puzzle prior to this point in the game which would mean they would not necessarily make the connection that clicking on the machinery at a key moment would make this happen
chris csullion of official nintendo magazine said that if you 've played broken sword the words the goat puzzle will probably make you break out in a cold sweat
geoff thew of hardcore gamer wrote that broken sword was known for intricate challenging puzzles some infamously so
the puzzle appeared on computer and video games <year> feature gaming 's hardest puzzles
in <year> it was listed on gamefront 's <num> crazy difficult and intricate video game puzzles
during a classic postmortem for the shadow of the templars at the european game developers conference in august <year> when cecil brought up the topic of difficult puzzles a member of the audience shouted that fucking goat laughter ensued and cecil added it was very unfair and it was absolutely bewildering
he also continued claiming he knew he had made it when a taxi driver once questioned him about his occupation upon finding out he had written broken sword the driver exclaimed ah so you 're the one responsible for the goat puzzle the puzzle was simplified in the shadow of the templars <year> director 's cut by according to cecil adding a more logical solution
this version of the game includes a diary in which the character takes notes after completing the goat puzzle george 's diary reads so the ghost of lochmarne is no more than a fierce billy goat
for a moment i thought it was going to be incredibly awkward to get past but in the end it was surprisingly simple
who would have known as a reference to the original puzzle 's reputation
an easter egg involving a talking goat was included in the shadow of the templars sequel broken sword ii the smoking mirror <year>
a goat puzzle was featured in broken sword <num> the serpent 's curse in the beginning and ending of <year> second and final episode of the title as part of the achieved <num> @,@ <num> kickstarter stretch goal
it was an attempt to escape from the unprofitable low end of the market and one of the last calculators sinclair produced
made with a case of pressed steel that a variety of finishes it cost between gb £ <num> and gb £ <num> at a time when other calculators could be purchased for under gb £ <num>
a number of factors meant that the sovereign was not a commercial success including the cost high import levies on components competition from cheaper calculators manufactured abroad and the development of more power @-@ efficient designs using liquid @-@ crystal displays
though it came with a five @-@ year guarantee issues such as short battery life limited its usefulness
the company moved on to producing computers soon afterwards
the design by john pemberton won a design council award and there are examples of the sovereign in the museum of modern art in new york
it had a mostek mk50321n main integrated circuit and a small memory register a led display and could perform a variety of a number of basic mathematical operations besides four @-@ function arithmetic
the executive had retailed for gb £ <num> when introduced but in little over a year it was possible to purchase a sinclair calculator for gb £ <num> and by november of <year> a model was available for gb £ <num>
<num>
cheaper calculators with liquid @-@ crystal displays instead of light @-@ emitting diodes were becoming more popular and had much longer battery lives of months or years
such calculators were available for well under gb £ <num> with all the functionality of the more expensive models
the impossibility of selling simple calculators profitibly led sinclair to introduce models such as the cambridge scientific introduced in august <year> at a price of gb £ <num>
<num>
the sovereign released in <year> represented an attempt to move upmarket in an increasingly saturated market
in december <year> the chrome plated version of the sovereign cost gb £ <num> and the gold @-@ plated version gb £ <num> including vat but profit margins on the sovereign were so small that sinclair ended up selling the sovereign at a loss and it was not a commercial success
the sovereign was made in england like every other sinclair calculator except the president
sinclair would shortly stop producing calculators and instead focus on computers starting with the mk14 in <year>
the loss of the calculator market was due in part to technological development leading to smaller and cheaper components which put heavy pressure on profit margins
an import levy of up to <num>
<num> was placed on components but the duty for calculators imported from japan or hong kong could be as little as <num> making it unprofitable to produce calculators in the uk
sinclair also had some problems with the reliability of earlier calculators that had adversely affected its reputation but the sovereign was sold with a full and unconditional five year guarantee
it had an <num> @-@ digit seven @-@ segment display that used red light @-@ emitting diodes with a decimal point to the right of each digit that could be illuminated as necessary
power was provided by two <num>
<num> mercury button cells
the sovereign measured <num> by <num> by <num> millimetres <num>
<num> in × <num>
<num> in × <num>
<num> in which made it small and sleek compared to other calculators of the time
the sovereign was unusual because the casing was made from pressed steel which gave it a much higher quality feel compared to injection moulded plastic
this allowed a variety of paint and plating options including black painted chrome @-@ plated silver @-@ plated and gold @-@ plated and a limited edition silver @-@ plated version inscribed to commemorate the silver jubilee of queen elizabeth ii in <year> were also produced
asprey of london was rumoured to have produced two sovereigns in solid gold costing gb £ <num> @,@ <num> each
the design by john pemberton won the design council award in <year> as the executive had in <year> and there are examples in the collection of the museum of modern art in new york
sovereigns are highly collectible and used models command high prices
with an eight @-@ digit display the calculator could display positive numbers between <num>
<num> and <num> @,@ <num> @,@ <num> and negative numbers between <num>
<num> and <num>
calculators of the time tended to have displays of between <num> and <num> digits as reducing the number of digits was an effective way of reducing the cost of the calculator
a number outside that range leads to an overflow and the screen flashes and all keys except the clear key are rendered inoperable to inform the user of the error
a independent memory register could read information from the screen and information could only be taken from the memory onto the screen
five keys were used for memory operations
the sovereign used a mostek mk50321n main integrated circuit the same as the sinclair wrist calculator and some variants of the sinclair cambridge
clive sinclair had assumed that people would prefer attractive illuminated led displays to lcd displays which incidentally also required more expensive cmos chips
however his calculators were designed with the assumption they would be turned off between calculations which did not prove to be the case
advertisements suggested that the batteries would last about a year under normal use but in reality the small button cell batteries and comparatively high power consumption meant a short battery life compared to the competition
it took place on november <num> <year> at the richfield coliseum in richfield township ohio
the buildup to the pay @-@ per @-@ view consisted of feuds scripted by the wwf 's writers and the matches that took place at the event had pre @-@ determined outcomes that had been decided by the company
in the main event bret hart retained his wwf world heavyweight championship against shawn michaels
the card also included a highly @-@ promoted match in which the team of randy savage and mr
perfect defeated the team of ric flair and razor ramon by disqualification the ultimate warrior was advertised for the show but left the company and was replaced by perfect
also featured were two speciality matches the undertaker won a coffin match against kamala and the big boss man defeated nailz in a nightstick on a pole match
some of the matches were changed after they were first announced as several wrestlers left the wwf shortly before the event
critics have praised the main event and the tag team match that was won by savage and perfect
although the remaining bouts have received low ratings critics have felt that those two matches made the event worth watching
in early <year> nailz appeared in introductory vignettes to talk about his hatred of the big boss man
upon his debut in the wwf nailz attacked bossman and stole his nightstick which he used to attack his opponents over the following months
shortly after tatanka 's debut in the wwf he became involved in a feud with rick martel
they faced each other at wrestlemania viii and tatanka defeated martel
the following month martel gained revenge by attacking tatanka with an atomizer of cologne and stealing the eagle feathers that tatanka carried to symbolize his lumbee heritage
ric flair and his executive consultant mr
perfect had been allies in the wwf for much of <year>
after flair lost the wwf world heavyweight championship to macho man randy savage at wrestlemania viii flair and perfect initiated a feud with savage
they interfered in savage 's match at summerslam and caused him to lose by countout
the rivalry continued and flair received assistance from perfect and razor ramon to win the title back from savage on september <num> which aired on the september <num> edition of wwf prime time wrestling
the wwf planned for savage to team with the ultimate warrior in a match against flair and ramon at survivor series
the ultimate warrior left the wwf however before the match could take place
two possible reasons have been given for his departure
the first states that he was fired due to allegations of steroid abuse while the other states that he was upset with the wwf 's future plans for his character
the wwf was forced to change the plan and decided to turn perfect into a babyface fan favorite from a heel
perfect and flair began having conflicts while teaming together and perfect accepted savage 's offer on the november <num> episode of wwf prime time wrestling to team with him at survivor series
money inc
million dollar man ted dibiase and irwin r
schyster had been feuding with the natural disasters earthquake and typhoon since february <year> when manager jimmy hart turned on earthquake and typhoon in favor of helping money inc
with hart 's assistance money inc
defeated the legion of doom for the wwf tag team championship on february <num> <year>
five months later earthquake and typhoon defeated money inc
to win the championship
the natural disasters were also feuding with the beverly brothers beau and blake and defeated them in a title match at summerslam <year>
a match was then announced for survivor series in which the natural disasters would team with the bushwhackers luke and butch to face money inc
and the beverly brothers
however when the nasty boys brian knobbs and jerry sags also managed by hart were scheduled to face the natural disasters for the title on october <num> hart replaced the nasty boys at the last minute with money inc
who went on to regain the championship with help from the headshrinkers
this led to a break @-@ up between hart and the nasty boys who received the bushwhackers spot in the survivor series match to get revenge against jimmy hart and money inc
at summerslam <year> in august the undertaker defeated kamala
harvey wippleman kamala 's manager wanted revenge so a rematch was scheduled for survivor series
the match was promoted as the wwf 's first coffin match in which the winner would place the loser in a coffin after the match
the wwf also planned a match featuring the british bulldog defending the wwf intercontinental championship against the mountie at survivor series
the wwf released smith due to steroid allegations however and he was made to drop the title belt to shawn michaels on the november <num> episode of saturday night 's main event
jake roberts was set to challenge bret hart who had won the wwf world heavyweight championship on october <num> for his title but the promotion could not come to terms with roberts
ultimately the wwf neglected to include an intercontinental championship match on the card instead pitting michaels against hart
in this match hart 's title was defended while michaels title was not
in the first televised match high energy owen hart and koko b
ware faced the headshrinkers samu and fatu
samu used his strength advantage to control the opening of the match against hart
ware entered the match and gained the advantage over both opponents until he attempted to knock the headshrinkers heads against each other
according to wwf storylines samoans like the headshrinkers have thick skulls and cannot be hurt in the head as a result the headshrinkers no @-@ sold the attack
afa the headshrinkers manager attacked ware while the referee was distracted
samu and fatu took turns attacking ware and fatu performed a thrust kick on ware
the headshrinkers used rulebreaking tactics to control the match until hart was able to enter the match
he performed dropkicks from the top rope against both headshrinkers
as he tried to attack samu from the top rope again samu caught him and powerslammed him before fatu executed a diving splash to get the pinfall victory
the next match between the big boss man and nailz was a nightstick on a pole match
a nightstick was suspended above the ring and could be used as a weapon once it was retrieved
nailz began the match by attempting to get the nightstick but boss man stopped him
nailz choked boss man before making another unsuccessful attempt to climb the pole and obtain the nightstick
boss man punched nailz and then tried to climb the pole
nailz stopped him performed a back body drop and choked boss man again

he hit nailz with it but nailz took it and used it against boss man
boss man performed the boss man slam his finishing move before pinning nailz to win the match
tatanka controlled the opening of the next match against the model rick martel with several throws and dropkicks
martel responded by wearing tatanka down with a front facelock
tatanka escaped but martel used another front facelock almost immediately
he performed a neckbreaker on tatanka before going back to the same hold as before
tatanka gained the advantage by performing a clothesline on martel
martel ran at tatanka but tatanka moved out of the way and martel hit his shoulder against the ring post
tatanka focused on attacking martel 's injured shoulder but eventually was thrown out of the ring by martel
martel 's advantage was short @-@ lived as tatanka performed a series of backhand chops and a tomahawk chop from the top rope before nailing the model with a samoan drop
tatanka got the pinfall victory and retrieved his feathers from martel after the match
while the match was in progress doink the clown who had not yet been named or debuted as a wrestler in the wwf stood in the aisle and made balloon animals before popping them to upset the children in the audience
in the next contest ric flair and razor ramon wrestled against mr
perfect and randy savage
ramon and perfect began the match but flair entered after perfect insulted him
perfect threw flair into the corner and flair 's momentum carried him over the top rope to the ring apron
savage attacked flair and then took perfect 's place in the ring to maintain the advantage over flair
from outside the ring ramon hit savage with his knee and flair and ramon took turns attacking savage 's knee
while ramon performed a half boston crab on savage perfect considered leaving the match and abandoning savage
savage recovered briefly by trying to pin flair but ramon performed a chokeslam on savage
ric flair attempted to attack savage from the top rope but savage threw him to the ring floor instead
perfect executed a neckbreaker and an atomic drop on ramon
outside of the ring flair attacked savage with a chair
the referee was knocked unconscious and perfect tried to pin ramon by performing a perfectplex
because no referee was available to count the pinfall a substitute referee came to the ring
the first referee recovered as perfect attempted to pin flair with a perfectplex
flair escaped the pin attempt and he and ramon attacked perfect until the referees were unable to keep the match under control
as a result ramon and flair were disqualified and the victory was awarded to perfect and savage
in the next match virgil faced yokozuna who was billed at <num> pounds
virgil was unable to knock yokozuna down with several dropkicks
yokozuna performed a savate kick on virgil before throwing him to the ring floor twice
he executed a legdrop on virgil but virgil regained the advantage when yokozuna accidentally ran into the ring pole while trying to attack virgil
yokozuna won the match after a splash in the corner and a banzai drop
the following match was a tag team elimination match in which the natural disasters earthquake and typhoon teamed with the nasty boys jerry sags and brian knobbs to face money inc
ted dibiase and irwin r
schyster and the beverly brothers beau and blake
the rules stated that when any man was eliminated his tag team partner would also be eliminated
blake beverly and typhoon began the match but beau and earthquake soon entered the ring as well
the natural disasters gained control of the match by attacking blake beverly and the nasty boys entered the ring to assist the disasters
blake attacked sags and tagged out of the match
beau entered but was bodyslammed by sags sags got distracted however which allowed beau to suplex him and bring dibiase into the match
money inc

earthquake performed an earthquake splash by sitting on beau beverly to pin him and eliminate both beverly brothers
earthquake fought dibiase but both men eventually left the ring and were replaced by their partners
typhoon performed a splash on schyster but was tripped by dibiase
schyster pinned typhoon to eliminate the natural disasters
while schyster was celebrating sags quickly pinned him to win the match for the nasty boys
the coffin match in which the undertaker faced kamala came next
kamala began the match by running in fear from the undertaker
he gained the early advantage however by suddenly turning around and attacking the undertaker
kamala bodyslammed the undertaker three times and performed three splashes
in an attempt to revive the undertaker paul bearer his manager held up an urn that was said to be the source of the undertaker 's power
kim chee one of kamala 's handler 's attacked bearer
the undertaker picked up the urn which had rolled into the ring and hit kamala with it
the undertaker pinned kamala to win the match placed him in a coffin and nailed the lid shut
in the main event of the card bret hart defended his wwf world heavyweight championship against shawn michaels
hart controlled the beginning of the match by repeatedly executing armdrags and armbars but michaels gained the advantage when the hitman missed a charge into the corner and collided shoulder @-@ first with the ring post
michaels then threw hart into another ring post and wore him down by executing a front facelock
hart was able to avoid michaels first attempt at his finisher the modified back suplex and rallied with his trademark moves including an elbow from the second rope running bulldog and a superplex
michaels recovered and performed a superkick on hart and was able this time to apply his suplex but hart kicked out
after hart missed a desperation crossbody and crotched himself on the ropes shawn attempted a dropkick from the middle rope but hart grabbed michaels legs and applied the sharpshooter his finishing move
he retained his championship by forcing michaels to submit
perfect continued their feud although flair legitimately requested to be released from his wwf contract in order to return to world championship wrestling wcw
his request was granted on the condition that he help build up perfect as a credible babyface
the two men attacked each other during the battle royal at royal rumble <year> and perfect eliminated flair from the match
the following night perfect defeated flair in a loser leaves town match
flair did not return to the wwf until mcmahon purchased wcw in <year>
the undertaker 's feud with harvey wippleman continued for several months after survivor series
at royal rumble <year> wippleman introduced a new wrestler named giant gonzalez
despite not being scheduled in the match gonzalez attacked the undertaker and eliminated him from the royal rumble match
the two men faced each other at wrestlemania ix where gonzalez was disqualified for attacking the undertaker with a rag soaked in chloroform
wippleman led gonzalez and mr
hughes in another attack on the undertaker in which hughes stole the undertaker 's urn
the feud was resolved at summerslam <year> when the undertaker defeated gonzalez in a rest in peace match
yokozuna 's push continued and he won the battle royal main event at royal rumble <year> to earn a wwf championship match against bret hart at wrestlemania ix
at wrestlemania he defeated hart to win the title belt
he immediately challenged hulk hogan to a match however and wrestlemania ended with yokozuna losing the wwf championship to hogan in <num> seconds
kevin wacholz who had portrayed nailz left the wwf shortly after survivor series
upset about his pay from summerslam <year> he confronted wwf owner vince mcmahon and reportedly attacked him physically
he later testified against mcmahon during a trial in which mcmahon was accused of distributing steroids to wrestlers
wacholz statements have been reported as having a harmful effect on the prosecution 's case because his anger at mcmahon overshadowed his testimony
shawn michaels became involved in a feud with his former tag team partner marty jannetty
the team had split up earlier in the year when michaels attacked jannetty
michaels defeated jannetty at royal rumble <year> but the two traded the intercontinental championship back and forth in subsequent rematches
it drew more fans than any of the following three survivor series event would draw
the pay @-@ per @-@ view buyrate was <num>
<num> which means that <num>
<num> percent of households to which the event was available purchased the pay @-@ per @-@ view
this was to that point the lowest buyrate in survivor series history and down more than one @-@ third from the previous year 's <num>
<num> buyrate
the buyrate was higher than that of any of the following twelve survivor series events however
writing for the history of wwe matt pettycord stated that the event was pretty decent considering that the mountie davey boy smith and the ultimate warrior left the company shortly before the event
on a five @-@ star scale he rated only the flair ramon vs
savage perfect match and the hart vs
michaels match higher than one star
he stated that the event is recommended but not required although the wwf championship match was a must @-@ see
adam gutschmidt reviewing the event for online onslaught gave a rating of one @-@ quarter star for the nightstick on a pole match and one @-@ half star each for the high energy vs
the headshrinkers match and the yokozuna vs
virgil match
he enjoyed the wwf championship match although he was disappointed by its lack of buildup prior to the event
he also felt that the flair ramon vs
savage perfect match was a good one until the ending got out of control
pro wrestling torch columnist agreed stating that the wwf championship match was the best and that the flair ramon vs
savage perfect bout was also enjoyable but he recommended fast @-@ forwarding through the rest of the show
the event was released in north america on vhs by coliseum video on february <num> <year>
the vhs version was released in the united kingdom on march <num> <year>
a dvd version is also available in the united kingdom it was packaged together with survivor series <year> as part of the wwe tagged classics line and released on november <num> <year>
it was directed and produced by the teng chun
adapted from legend of the white snake a chinese folktale it follows a magical snake who passes as a human but ultimately dies
the film now possibly lost was followed by one sequel anaknja siloeman oeler poeti in <year>
her competitor a black snake does likewise
the two compete for the love of a man named khouw han boen
ultimately khouw agrees to marry the former white snake but when her true identity is revealed he attempts to cancel their wedding
the snake @-@ woman crying tells khouw 's boss that they are to be married and ultimately khouw is guilted into marrying her
as time passes khouw sees his wife occasionally transform into a snake
she is always however able to convince him otherwise
he falls further in love with her and their marriage is a happy one
after several months he is accosted by a priest hoat hae sian soe who then leads an attempt to kill the snake @-@ woman
she escapes pursued by the priests
the priests catch the snake and prepare to kill her but are stopped by the goddess kwan im who tells the stunned pursuers that the snake is pregnant and thus must not be killed
a month after the snake gives birth the priests return
the snake @-@ woman gives her child to khouw and then surrenders herself to her fate
she is captured in a magical jar and brought away
since releasing sam pek eng tay in <year> based on the legend of the butterfly lovers the teng chun had released a series of films based on chinese legends and folktales including pat bie to eight beautiful women <year> and pat kiam hiap eight swordsmen <year>
these stories were selected because the peranakan chinese in the indies were unable to understand mandarin and cantonese imports from china but wanted to see films based on chinese mythology
overall the teng chun 's films emphasised the martial art silat and were generally profitable allowing him to dominate the industry
the cast of this black @-@ and @-@ white film is unrecorded
the dialogue captured by the film 's director @-@ cum @-@ producer was in malay
the snakes used in the production of this film came from the teng chun 's personal zoo
newspaper advertisements show the film being screened by february <year>
the film mostly targeted ethnic chinese audiences
advertising material however emphasised the use of spoken malay and described the film as full of astonishments and all forms of magic fights through these action sequences ouw peh tjoa proved popular among native audiences
the film was exported to singapore part of the straits settlements where there was a large ethnic chinese population
the success of ouw peh tjoa allowed the teng chun to import new equipment for his studio renamed java industrial film which he used in his future productions
the film was followed in <year> by a sequel anaknja siloeman oeler poeti child of the white snake
the teng chun continued releasing films based on chinese legends until <year> a year after albert balink 's pareh changed domestic perceptions of profitable film storylines
the 's later films adapted stories closer to the native populace of the indies and focussing on events that could happen in day @-@ to @-@ day life
through <year> and <year> java industrial films was the most productive studio in the indies until it was shut down during the japanese occupation which began in march <year>
screenings of ouw peh tjoa continued until at least <year>
the film is now likely lost
movies in the indies were recorded on highly flammable nitrate film and after a fire destroyed much of produksi film negara 's warehouse in <year> old films shot on nitrate were deliberately destroyed
as such the american visual anthropologist karl g
heider writes that all indonesian films from before <year> are lost
however jb kristanto 's katalog film indonesia indonesian film catalogue records several as having survived at sinematek indonesia 's archives and biran writes that several japanese propaganda films have survived at the netherlands government information service

the bell is currently held by the royal canadian legion lantzville british columbia
the seeds of modern ai were planted by classical philosophers who attempted to describe the process of human thinking as the mechanical manipulation of symbols
this work culminated in the invention of the programmable digital computer in the <num> a machine based on the abstract essence of mathematical reasoning
this device and the ideas behind it inspired a handful of scientists to begin seriously discussing the possibility of building an electronic brain
the turing test was proposed by british mathematician alan turing in his <year> paper computing machinery and intelligence which opens with the words i propose to consider the question can machines think the term artificial intelligence was created at a conference held at dartmouth college in <year>

simon pioneered the newly created artificial intelligence field with the logic theory machine <year> and the general problem solver in <year>
in <year> john mccarthy and marvin minsky started the mit artificial intelligence lab with <num> @,@ <num>
john mccarthy also created lisp in the summer of <year> a programming language still important in artificial intelligence research
in <year> in response to the criticism of james lighthill and ongoing pressure from congress the u
s
and british governments stopped funding undirected research into artificial intelligence
seven years later a visionary initiative by the japanese government inspired governments and industry to provide ai with billions of dollars but by the late <num> the investors became disillusioned and withdrew funding again
in the middle ages there were rumors of secret mystical or alchemical means of placing mind into matter such as jābir ibn hayyān 's takwin paracelsus homunculus and rabbi judah loew 's golem
by the <num> century ideas about artificial men and thinking machines were developed in fiction as in mary shelley 's frankenstein or karel čapek 's r
u
r
rossum 's universal robots and speculation such as samuel butler 's darwin among the machines
ai has continued to be an important element of science fiction into the present
the oldest known automatons were the sacred statues of ancient egypt and greece
the faithful believed that craftsman had imbued these figures with very real minds capable of wisdom and emotion — hermes trismegistus wrote that by discovering the true nature of the gods man has been able to reproduce it
the study of mechanical — or formal — reasoning has a long history
chinese indian and greek philosophers all developed structured methods of formal deduction in the first millennium bce
their ideas were developed over the centuries by philosophers such as aristotle who gave a formal analysis of the syllogism euclid whose elements was a model of formal reasoning muslim mathematician al @-@ khwārizmī who developed algebra and gave his name to algorithm and european scholastic philosophers such as william of ockham and duns scotus
majorcan philosopher ramon llull <num> – <num> developed several logical machines devoted to the production of knowledge by logical means llull described his machines as mechanical entities that could combine basic and undeniable truths by simple logical operations produced by the machine by mechanical meanings in such ways as to produce all the possible knowledge
llull 's work had a great influence on gottfried leibniz who redeveloped his ideas
in the <num> century leibniz thomas hobbes and rené descartes explored the possibility that all rational thought could be made as systematic as algebra or geometry
hobbes famously wrote in leviathan reason is nothing but reckoning
leibniz envisioned a universal language of reasoning his characteristica universalis which would reduce argumentation to calculation so that there would be no more need of disputation between two philosophers than between two accountants
for it would suffice to take their pencils in hand down to their slates and to say each other with a friend as witness if they liked let us calculate
these philosophers had begun to articulate the physical symbol system hypothesis that would become the guiding faith of ai research
in the <num> century the study of mathematical logic provided the essential breakthrough that made artificial intelligence seem plausible
the foundations had been set by such works as boole 's the laws of thought and frege 's begriffsschrift
building on frege 's system russell and whitehead presented a formal treatment of the foundations of mathematics in their masterpiece the principia mathematica in <year>
inspired by russell 's success david hilbert challenged mathematicians of the <num> and <num> to answer this fundamental question can all of mathematical reasoning be formalized his question was answered by gödel 's incompleteness proof turing 's machine and church 's lambda calculus
their answer was surprising in two ways
first they proved that there were in fact limits to what mathematical logic could accomplish
but second and more important for ai their work suggested that within these limits any form of mathematical reasoning could be mechanized
the church @-@ turing thesis implied that a mechanical device shuffling symbols as simple as <num> and <num> could imitate any conceivable process of mathematical deduction
the key insight was the turing machine — a simple theoretical construct that captured the essence of abstract symbol manipulation
this invention would inspire a handful of scientists to begin discussing the possibility of thinking machines
in the early <num> century charles babbage designed a programmable computer the analytical engine although it was never built
ada lovelace speculated that the machine might compose elaborate and scientific pieces of music of any degree of complexity or extent
she is often credited as the first programmer because of a set of notes she wrote that completely detail a method for calculating bernoulli numbers with the engine
the first modern computers were the massive code breaking machines of the second world war such as z3 eniac and colossus
the latter two of these machines were based on the theoretical foundation laid by alan turing and developed by john von neumann
the field of artificial intelligence research was founded as an academic discipline in <year>
recent research in neurology had shown that the brain was an electrical network of neurons that fired in all @-@ or @-@ nothing pulses
norbert wiener 's cybernetics described control and stability in electrical networks
claude shannon 's information theory described digital signals i
e
all @-@ or @-@ nothing signals
alan turing 's theory of computation showed that any form of computation could be described digitally
the close relationship between these ideas suggested that it might be possible to construct an electronic brain
examples of work in this vein includes robots such as w
grey walter 's turtles and the johns hopkins beast
these machines did not use computers digital electronics or symbolic reasoning they were controlled entirely by analog circuitry
walter pitts and warren mcculloch analyzed networks of idealized artificial neurons and showed how they might perform simple logical functions
they were the first to describe what later researchers would call a neural network
one of the students inspired by pitts and mcculloch was a young marvin minsky then a <num> @-@ year @-@ old graduate student
in <year> with dean edmonds he built the first neural net machine the snarc
minsky was to become one of the most important leaders and innovators in ai for the next <num> years
he noted that thinking is difficult to define and devised his famous turing test
if a machine could carry on a conversation over a teleprinter that was indistinguishable from a conversation with a human being then it was reasonable to say that the machine was thinking
this simplified version of the problem allowed turing to argue convincingly that a thinking machine was at least plausible and the paper answered all the most common objections to the proposition
the turing test was the first serious proposal in the philosophy of artificial intelligence
arthur samuel 's checkers program developed in the middle <num> and early <num> eventually achieved sufficient skill to challenge a respectable amateur
game ai would continue to be used as a measure of progress in ai throughout its history
this was a new approach to creating thinking machines
in <year> allen newell and future nobel laureate herbert a
simon created the logic theorist with help from j
c
shaw
the program would eventually prove <num> of the first <num> theorems in russell and whitehead 's principia mathematica and find new and more elegant proofs for some
simon said that they had solved the venerable mind body problem explaining how a system composed of matter can have the properties of mind
this was an early statement of the philosophical position john searle would later call strong ai that machines can contain minds just as human bodies do
the proposal for the conference included this assertion every aspect of learning or any other feature of intelligence can be so precisely described that a machine can be made to simulate it
the participants included ray solomonoff oliver selfridge trenchard more arthur samuel allen newell and herbert a
simon all of whom would create important programs during the first decades of ai research
at the conference newell and simon debuted the logic theorist and mccarthy persuaded the attendees to accept artificial intelligence as the name of the field
the <year> dartmouth conference was the moment that ai gained its name its mission its first success and its major players and is widely considered the birth of ai
the programs that were developed during this time were to most people simply astonishing computers were solving algebra word problems proving theorems in geometry and learning to speak english
few at the time would have believed that such intelligent behavior by machines was possible at all
researchers expressed an intense optimism in private and in print predicting that a fully intelligent machine would be built in less than <num> years
government agencies like arpa poured money into the new field
to achieve some goal like winning a game or proving a theorem they proceeded step by step towards it by making a move or a deduction as if searching through a maze backtracking whenever they reached a dead end
this paradigm was called reasoning as search
the principal difficulty was that for many problems the number of possible paths through the maze was simply astronomical a situation known as a combinatorial explosion
researchers would reduce the search space by using heuristics or rules of thumb that would eliminate those paths that were unlikely to lead to a solution
newell and simon tried to capture a general version of this algorithm in a program called the general problem solver
other searching programs were able to accomplish impressive tasks like solving problems in geometry and algebra such as herbert gelernter 's geometry theorem prover <year> and saint written by minsky 's student james slagle <year>
other programs searched through goals and subgoals to plan actions like the strips system developed at stanford to control the behavior of their robot shakey
an early success was daniel bobrow 's program student which could solve high school algebra word problems
a semantic net represents concepts e
g
house door as nodes and relations among concepts e
g
has @-@ a as links between the nodes
the first ai program to use a semantic net was written by ross quillian and the most successful and controversial version was roger schank 's conceptual dependency theory
joseph weizenbaum 's eliza could carry out conversations that were so realistic that users occasionally were fooled into thinking they were communicating with a human being and not a program
but in fact eliza had no idea what she was talking about
she simply gave a canned response or repeated back what was said to her rephrasing her response with a few grammar rules
eliza was the first chatterbot
they pointed out that in successful sciences like physics basic principles were often best understood using simplified models like frictionless planes or perfectly rigid bodies
much of the research focused on a blocks world which consists of colored blocks of various shapes and sizes arrayed on a flat surface
this paradigm led to innovative work in machine vision by gerald sussman who led the team adolfo guzman david waltz who invented constraint propagation and especially patrick winston
at the same time minsky and papert built a robot arm that could stack blocks bringing the blocks world to life
the crowning achievement of the micro @-@ world program was terry winograd 's shrdlu
it could communicate in ordinary english sentences plan operations and execute them

<num> million grant from the newly created advanced research projects agency later known as darpa
the money was used to fund project mac which subsumed the ai group founded by minsky and mccarthy five years earlier
darpa continued to provide three million dollars a year until the <num>
darpa made similar grants to newell and simon 's program at cmu and to the stanford ai project founded by john mccarthy in <year>
another important ai laboratory was established at edinburgh university by donald michie in <year>
these four institutions would continue to be the main centers of ai research and funding in academia for many years
the money was proffered with few strings attached j
c
r
licklider then the director of arpa believed that his organization should fund people not projects and allowed researchers to pursue whatever directions might interest them
this created a freewheeling atmosphere at mit that gave birth to the hacker culture but this hands off approach would not last
ai researchers had failed to appreciate the difficulty of the problems they faced
their tremendous optimism had raised expectations impossibly high and when the promised results failed to materialize funding for ai disappeared
at the same time the field of connectionism or neural nets was shut down almost completely for <num> years by marvin minsky 's devastating criticism of perceptrons
despite the difficulties with public perception of ai in the late <num> new ideas were explored in logic programming commonsense reasoning and many other areas
even the most impressive could only handle trivial versions of the problems they were supposed to solve all the programs were in some sense toys
ai researchers had begun to run into several fundamental limits that could not be overcome in the <num>
although some of these limits would be conquered in later decades others still stymie the field to this day
limited computer power there was not enough memory or processing speed to accomplish anything truly useful
for example ross quillian 's successful work on natural language was demonstrated with a vocabulary of only twenty words because that was all that would fit in memory
hans moravec argued in <year> that computers were still millions of times too weak to exhibit intelligence
he suggested an analogy artificial intelligence requires computer power in the same way that aircraft require horsepower
below a certain threshold it 's impossible but as power increases eventually it could become easy
with regard to computer vision moravec estimated that simply matching the edge and motion detection capabilities of human retina in real time would require a general @-@ purpose computer capable of <num> operations second <num> mips
as of <year> practical computer vision applications require <num> @,@ <num> to <num> @,@ <num> @,@ <num> mips
by comparison the fastest supercomputer in <year> cray @-@ <num> retailing at <num> million to <num> million was only capable of around <num> to <num> mips and a typical desktop computer at the time achieved less than <num> mips
intractability and the combinatorial explosion
in <year> richard karp building on stephen cook 's <year> theorem showed there are many problems that can probably only be solved in exponential time in the size of the inputs
finding optimal solutions to these problems requires unimaginable amounts of computer time except when the problems are trivial
this almost certainly meant that many of the toy solutions used by ai would probably never scale up into useful systems
commonsense knowledge and reasoning
many important artificial intelligence applications like vision or natural language require simply enormous amounts of information about the world the program needs to have some idea of what it might be looking at or what it is talking about
this requires that the program know most of the same things about the world that a child does
researchers soon discovered that this was a truly vast amount of information
no one in <year> could build a database so large and no one knew how a program might learn so much information
moravec 's paradox proving theorems and solving geometry problems is comparatively easy for computers but a supposedly simple task like recognizing a face or crossing a room without bumping into anything is extremely difficult
this helps explain why research into vision and robotics had made so little progress by the middle <num>
the frame and qualification problems
ai researchers like john mccarthy who used logic discovered that they could not represent ordinary deductions that involved planning or default reasoning without making changes to the structure of logic itself
they developed new logics like non @-@ monotonic logics and modal logics to try to solve the problems
the pattern began as early as <year> when the alpac report appeared criticizing machine translation efforts
after spending <num> million dollars the nrc ended all support
in <year> the lighthill report on the state of ai research in england criticized the utter failure of ai to achieve its grandiose objectives and led to the dismantling of ai research in that country
the report specifically mentioned the combinatorial explosion problem as a reason for ai 's failings
darpa was deeply disappointed with researchers working on the speech understanding research program at cmu and canceled an annual grant of three million dollars
by <year> funding for ai projects was hard to find
hans moravec blamed the crisis on the unrealistic predictions of his colleagues
many researchers were caught up in a web of increasing exaggeration
however there was another issue since the passage of the mansfield amendment in <year> darpa had been under increasing pressure to fund mission @-@ oriented direct research rather than basic undirected research
funding for the creative freewheeling exploration that had gone on in the <num> would not come from darpa
instead the money was directed at specific projects with clear objectives such as autonomous tanks and battle management systems
one of the earliest was john lucas who argued that gödel 's incompleteness theorem showed that a formal system such as a computer program could never see the truth of certain statements while a human being could
hubert dreyfus ridiculed the broken promises of the <num> and critiqued the assumptions of ai arguing that human reasoning actually involved very little symbol processing and a great deal of embodied instinctive unconscious know how
john searle 's chinese room argument presented in <year> attempted to show that a program could not be said to understand the symbols that it uses a quality called intentionality
if the symbols have no meaning for the machine searle argued then the machine can not be described as thinking
these critiques were not taken seriously by ai researchers often because they seemed so far off the point
problems like intractability and commonsense knowledge seemed much more immediate and serious
it was unclear what difference know how or intentionality made to an actual computer program
minsky said of dreyfus and searle they misunderstand and should be ignored
dreyfus who taught at mit was given a cold shoulder he later said that ai researchers dared not be seen having lunch with me
joseph weizenbaum the author of eliza felt his colleagues treatment of dreyfus was unprofessional and childish
although he was an outspoken critic of dreyfus positions he deliberately made it plain that theirs was not the way to treat a human being
weizenbaum began to have serious ethical doubts about ai when kenneth colby wrote doctor a chatterbot therapist
weizenbaum was disturbed that colby saw his mindless program as a serious therapeutic tool
a feud began and the situation was not helped when colby did not credit weizenbaum for his contribution to the program
in <year> weizenbaum published computer power and human reason which argued that the misuse of artificial intelligence has the potential to devalue human life
like most ai researchers he was optimistic about their power predicting that perceptron may eventually be able to learn make decisions and translate languages
an active research program into the paradigm was carried out throughout the <num> but came to a sudden halt with the publication of minsky and papert 's <year> book perceptrons
it suggested that there were severe limitations to what perceptrons could do and that frank rosenblatt 's predictions had been grossly exaggerated
the effect of the book was devastating virtually no research at all was done in connectionism for <num> years
eventually a new generation of researchers would revive the field and thereafter it would become a vital and useful part of artificial intelligence
rosenblatt would not live to see this as he died in a boating accident shortly after the book was published
in <year> j
alan robinson had discovered a simple method to implement deduction on computers the resolution and unification algorithm
however straightforward implementations like those attempted by mccarthy and his students in the late <num> were especially intractable the programs required astronomical numbers of steps to prove simple theorems
a more fruitful approach to logic was developed in the <num> by robert kowalski at the university of edinburgh and soon this led to the collaboration with french researchers alain colmerauer and philippe roussel who created the successful logic programming language prolog
prolog uses a subset of logic horn clauses closely related to rules and production rules that permit tractable computation
rules would continue to be influential providing a foundation for edward feigenbaum 's expert systems and the continuing work by allen newell and herbert a
simon that would lead to soar and their unified theories of cognition
critics of the logical approach noted as dreyfus had that human beings rarely used logic when they solved problems
experiments by psychologists like peter wason eleanor rosch amos tversky daniel kahneman and others provided proof
mccarthy responded that what people do is irrelevant
he argued that what is really needed are machines that can solve problems — not machines that think as people do
marvin minsky seymour papert and roger schank were trying to solve problems like story understanding and object recognition that required a machine to think like a person
in order to use ordinary concepts like chair or restaurant they had to make all the same illogical assumptions that people normally made
unfortunately imprecise concepts like these are hard to represent in logic
gerald sussman observed that using precise language to describe essentially imprecise concepts doesn 't make them any more precise
schank described their anti @-@ logic approaches as scruffy as opposed to the neat paradigms used by mccarthy kowalski feigenbaum newell and simon
in <year> in a seminal paper minsky noted that many of his fellow scruffy researchers were using the same kind of tool a framework that captures all our common sense assumptions about something
for example if we use the concept of a bird there is a constellation of facts that immediately come to mind we might assume that it flies eats worms and so on
we know these facts are not always true and that deductions using these facts will not be logical but these structured sets of assumptions are part of the context of everything we say and think
he called these structures frames
schank used a version of frames he called scripts to successfully answer questions about short stories in english
many years later object @-@ oriented programming would adopt the essential idea of inheritance from ai research on frames
in those same years the japanese government aggressively funded ai with its fifth generation computer project
another encouraging event in the early <num> was the revival of connectionism in the work of john hopfield and david rumelhart
once again ai had achieved success
the earliest examples were developed by edward feigenbaum and his students
dendral begun in <year> identified compounds from spectrometer readings
mycin developed in <year> diagnosed infectious blood diseases
they demonstrated the feasibility of the approach
expert systems restricted themselves to a small domain of specific knowledge thus avoiding the commonsense knowledge problem and their simple design made it relatively easy for programs to be built and then modified once they were in place
all in all the programs proved to be useful something that ai had not been able to achieve up to this point
in <year> an expert system called xcon was completed at cmu for the digital equipment corporation
it was an enormous success it was saving the company <num> million dollars annually by <year>
corporations around the world began to develop and deploy expert systems and by <year> they were spending over a billion dollars on ai most of it to in @-@ house ai departments
an industry grew up to support them including hardware companies like symbolics and lisp machines and software companies such as intellicorp and aion
they were part of a new direction in ai research that had been gaining ground throughout the <num>
ai researchers were beginning to suspect — reluctantly for it violated the scientific canon of parsimony — that intelligence might very well be based on the ability to use large amounts of diverse knowledge in different ways writes pamela mccorduck
t he great lesson from the <num> was that intelligent behavior depended very much on dealing with knowledge sometimes quite detailed knowledge of a domain where a given task lay
knowledge based systems and knowledge engineering became a major focus of ai research in the <num>
the <num> also saw the birth of cyc the first attempt to attack the commonsense knowledge problem directly by creating a massive database that would contain all the mundane facts that the average person knows
douglas lenat who started and led the project argued that there is no shortcut ― the only way for machines to know the meaning of human concepts is to teach them one concept at a time by hand
the project was not expected to be completed for many decades
chess playing programs hitech and deep thought defeated chess masters in <year>
both were developed by carnegie mellon university deep thought development paved the way for the deep blue
their objectives were to write programs and build machines that could carry on conversations translate languages interpret pictures and reason like human beings
much to the chagrin of scruffies they chose prolog as the primary computer language for the project
other countries responded with new programs of their own
the uk began the ₤ <num> million alvey project
a consortium of american companies formed the microelectronics and computer technology corporation or mcc to fund large scale projects in ai and information technology
darpa responded as well founding the strategic computing initiative and tripling its investment in ai between <year> and <year>
around the same time david rumelhart popularized a new method for training neural networks called backpropagation discovered years earlier by paul werbos
these two discoveries revived the field of connectionism which had been largely abandoned since <year>
the new field was unified and inspired by the appearance of parallel distributed processing in <year> — a two volume collection of papers edited by rumelhart and psychologist james mcclelland
neural networks would become commercially successful in the <num> when they began to be used as the engines driving programs like optical character recognition and speech recognition
the collapse was in the perception of ai by government agencies and investors – the field continued to make advances despite the criticism
rodney brooks and hans moravec researchers from the related field of robotics argued for an entirely new approach to artificial intelligence
their fears were well founded in the late <num> and early <num> ai suffered a series of financial setbacks
the first indication of a change in weather was the sudden collapse of the market for specialized ai hardware in <year>
desktop computers from apple and ibm had been steadily gaining speed and power and in <year> they became more powerful than the more expensive lisp machines made by symbolics and others
there was no longer a good reason to buy them
an entire industry worth half a billion dollars was demolished overnight
eventually the earliest successful expert systems such as xcon proved too expensive to maintain
they were difficult to update they could not learn they were brittle i
e
they could make grotesque mistakes when given unusual inputs and they fell prey to problems such as the qualification problem that had been identified years earlier
expert systems proved useful but only in a few special contexts
in the late <num> the strategic computing initiative cut funding to ai deeply and brutally
new leadership at darpa had decided that ai was not the next wave and directed funds towards projects that seemed more likely to produce immediate results
by <year> the impressive list of goals penned in <year> for japan 's fifth generation project had not been met
indeed some of them like carry on a casual conversation had not been met by <year>
as with other ai projects expectations had run much higher than what was actually possible
they believed that to show real intelligence a machine needs to have a body — it needs to perceive move survive and deal with the world
they argued that these sensorimotor skills are essential to higher level skills like commonsense reasoning and that abstract reasoning was actually the least interesting or important human skill see moravec 's paradox
they advocated building intelligence from the bottom up
the approach revived ideas from cybernetics and control theory that had been unpopular since the sixties
another precursor was david marr who had come to mit in the late <num> from a successful background in theoretical neuroscience to lead the group studying vision
he rejected all symbolic approaches both mccarthy 's logic and minsky 's frames arguing that ai needed to understand the physical machinery of vision from the bottom up before any symbolic processing took place
marr 's work would be cut short by leukemia in <year>
in a <year> paper elephants don 't play chess robotics researcher rodney brooks took direct aim at the physical symbol system hypothesis arguing that symbols are not always necessary since the world is its own best model
it is always exactly up to date
it always has every detail there is to be known
the trick is to sense it appropriately and often enough
in the <num> and <num> many cognitive scientists also rejected the symbol processing model of the mind and argued that the body was essential for reasoning a theory called the embodied mind thesis
it began to be used successfully throughout the technology industry although somewhat behind the scenes
some of the success was due to increasing computer power and some was achieved by focusing on specific isolated problems and pursuing them with the highest standards of scientific accountability
still the reputation of ai in the business world at least was less than pristine
inside the field there was little agreement on the reasons for ai 's failure to fulfill the dream of human level intelligence that had captured the imagination of the world in the <num>
together all these factors helped to fragment ai into competing subfields focused on particular problems or approaches sometimes even under new names that disguised the tarnished pedigree of artificial intelligence
ai was both more cautious and more successful than it had ever been
the super computer was a specialized version of a framework produced by ibm and was capable of processing twice as many moves per second as it had during the first match which deep blue had lost reportedly <num> @,@ <num> @,@ <num> moves per second
the event was broadcast live over the internet and received over <num> million hits
in <year> a stanford robot won the darpa grand challenge by driving autonomously for <num> miles along an unrehearsed desert trail
two years later a team from cmu won the darpa urban challenge by autonomously navigating <num> miles in an urban environment while adhering to traffic hazards and all traffic laws
in february <year> in a jeopardy quiz show exhibition match ibm 's question answering system watson defeated the two greatest jeopardy champions brad rutter and ken jennings by a significant margin
these successes were not due to some revolutionary new paradigm but mostly on the tedious application of engineering skill and on the tremendous power of computers today
in fact deep blue 's computer was <num> million times faster than the ferranti mark <num> that christopher strachey taught to play chess in <year>
this dramatic increase is measured by moore 's law which predicts that the speed and memory capacity of computers doubles every two years
the fundamental problem of raw computer power was slowly being overcome
although earlier researchers had proposed modular divide and conquer approaches to ai the intelligent agent did not reach its modern form until judea pearl allen newell and others brought concepts from decision theory and economics into the study of ai
when the economist 's definition of a rational agent was married to computer science 's definition of an object or module the intelligent agent paradigm was complete
an intelligent agent is a system that perceives its environment and takes actions which maximize its chances of success
by this definition simple programs that solve specific problems are intelligent agents as are human beings and organizations of human beings such as firms
the intelligent agent paradigm defines ai research as the study of intelligent agents
this is a generalization of some earlier definitions of ai it goes beyond studying human intelligence it studies all kinds of intelligence
the paradigm gave researchers license to study isolated problems and find solutions that were both verifiable and useful
it provided a common language to describe problems and share their solutions with each other and with other fields that also used concepts of abstract agents like economics and control theory
it was hoped that a complete agent architecture like newell 's soar would one day allow researchers to build more versatile and intelligent systems out of interacting intelligent agents
there was a widespread realization that many of the problems that ai needed to solve were already being worked on by researchers in fields like mathematics economics or operations research
the shared mathematical language allowed both a higher level of collaboration with more established and successful fields and the achievement of results which were measurable and provable ai had become a more rigorous scientific discipline
russell norvig <year> describe this as nothing less than a revolution and the victory of the neats
judea pearl 's highly influential <year> book brought probability and decision theory into ai
among the many new tools in use were bayesian networks hidden markov models information theory stochastic modeling and classical optimization
precise mathematical descriptions were also developed for computational intelligence paradigms like neural networks and evolutionary algorithms
ai had solved a lot of very difficult problems and their solutions proved to be useful throughout the technology industry such as data mining industrial robotics logistics speech recognition banking software medical diagnosis and google 's search engine
the field of ai receives little or no credit for these successes
many of ai 's greatest innovations have been reduced to the status of just another item in the tool chest of computer science
nick bostrom explains a lot of cutting edge ai has filtered into general applications often without being called ai because once something becomes useful enough and common enough it 's not labeled ai anymore
many researchers in ai in <num> deliberately called their work by other names such as informatics knowledge @-@ based systems cognitive systems or computational intelligence
in part this may be because they considered their field to be fundamentally different from ai but also the new names help to procure funding
in the commercial world at least the failed promises of the ai winter continue to haunt ai research as the new york times reported in <year> computer scientists and software engineers avoided the term artificial intelligence for fear of being viewed as wild @-@ eyed dreamers
clarke and stanley kubrick had imagined that by the year <year> a machine would exist with an intelligence that matched or exceeded the capability of human beings
the character they created hal <num> was based on a belief shared by many leading ai researchers that such a machine would exist by the year <year>
marvin minsky asks so the question is why didn 't we get hal in <year> minsky believes that the answer is that the central problems like commonsense reasoning were being neglected while most researchers pursued things like commercial applications of neural nets or genetic algorithms
john mccarthy on the other hand still blames the qualification problem
for ray kurzweil the issue is computer power and using moore 's law he predicts that machines with human @-@ level intelligence will appear by <year>
jeff hawkins argues that neural net research ignores the essential properties of the human cortex preferring simple models that have been successful at solving simple problems
there are many other explanations and for each there is a corresponding research program underway
graham originated from an area of convection that emerged onto water after sitting over australia on <num> february
the interaction with a monsoon trough formed an area of low pressure that developed into tropical cyclone graham on <num> february
the storm moved slowly to the east @-@ southeast and after turning to the south it peaked as a tropical storm and made landfall on western australia the next day
the cyclone weakened as it moved inland and dissipated on <num> march
the storm dropped heavy rainfall and caused high winds which produced flooding and downed trees
one fatality occurred though no significant damages were reported
the strengthening of a deep persistent monsoon trough contributed to cyclogenesis and a low pressure area formed
by <num> february the low developed a banding feature in which the highest winds were located
though the storm was located in an area of unfavorable wind shear the australian bureau of meteorology bom began to issue gale warnings on the system at <num> utc the next day while the low was located several hundred miles north @-@ northeast of port hedland
the disturbance was initially nearly stationary as it showed signs of organization due to relaxed shear and at <num> utc on <num> february the joint typhoon warning center jtwc designated the storm as tropical cyclone graham as it had attained <num> km h <num> mph <num> @-@ minute maximum sustained winds
the first warning was issued on graham later that day
initially exhibiting characteristics of a monsoonal low a mid @-@ level ridge to the south of graham caused strong westerly winds that moved the storm slowly east @-@ southeastward
however a deep trough eroded the ridge allowing the cyclone to move more towards the south
according to the jtwc the storm had intensified late on <num> february though at the same time the bom noted the slight weakening of the storm
graham reached its peak intensity that day while nearing the coast
the storm made landfall at western australia 's eighty mile beach at <year> utc on <num> february and began to weaken
the storm had dissipated on <num> march the bom issued their last advisory on the cyclone at <num> utc that day while similarly the jtwc issued their last advisory just two hours later
the storm 's remnants died out in the country 's desert
a warning was issued for bidyadanga pardoo and cotton creek
the storm 's landfall in western australia brought heavy rainfall and high winds
the storm dropped <num> mm <num>
<num> in of rain at telfer in one night over half the town 's annual average total rainfall reached <num> mm <num>
<num> in there
the heavy rain caused flooding and road closures and swelled a river passing through fitzroy crossing though the river only topped its banks slightly
near that town at blue bush creek while a group of people attempted to cross floodwaters two men were swept away
both men were rescued though one died before emergency services arrived
in addition to the flooding a number of trees were downed
no significant damages were reported
following the storm the name graham was retired from the australian region basin
while languedoc can refer to a specific historic region of france and northern catalonia usage since the <num> century especially in the context of wine has primarily referred to the northern part of the languedoc @-@ roussillon région of france an area which spans the mediterranean coastline from the french border with spain to the region of provence
the area has around <num> @,@ <num> acres <num> @,@ <num> km2 under vines and is the single biggest wine @-@ producing region in the world being responsible for more than a third of france 's total wine production
in <year> the region produced more wine than the united states
along with parts of provence these are the oldest planted vineyards in france
the region of languedoc has belonged to france since the thirteenth century and the roussillon was acquired from spain in the mid @-@ seventeenth century
the two regions were joined as one administrative region in the late <num>
from the <num> century through the <num> and early <num> centuries the languedoc had a reputation for producing high quality wine
in paris during the <num> century wines from the st
chinian area were prescribed in hospitals for their healing powers
during the advent of the industrial age in the late <num> century production shifted towards mass @-@ produced le gros rouge — cheap red wine that could satisfy the growing work force
the use of highly prolific grape varieties produced high yields and thin wines which were normally blended with red wine from algeria to give them more body
the phylloxera epidemic in the <num> century severely affected the languedoc wine industry killing off many of the higher quality vitis vinifera that were susceptible to the louse
american rootstock that was naturally resistant to phylloxera did not take well to the limestone soil on the hillside
in place of these vines acres of the lower quality aramon alicante bouschet and carignan were planted
during both world wars the languedoc was responsible for providing the daily wine rations given to french soldiers
in <year> algeria gained its independence from france bringing about an end to the blending of the stronger algerian red wine to mask the thin le gros rouge
this event coupled with french consumers moving away from cheap red wines in the <num> has contributed to several decades of surplus wine production in france with languedoc as the largest contributor to the european wine lake and recurring european union subsidies aimed at reducing production
these developments prompted many languedoc producers to start refocusing on higher quality but has also led to many local and regional protests including violent ones from the infamous comité régional d 'action viticole crav
despite the general reputation as a mass producer and a consensus that the region is in the midst of an economic crisis parts of the languedoc wine industry are experiencing commercial success due to outside investment and an increased focus on quality
sales have been improved by many vineyards that concentrate on creating a good brand name rather than relying on the sometimes infamous regional designations
some vineyards have adopted the youngest batch of aoc classifications developed in the late <num> while other vineyards eschew designated blends entirely and are instead shifting toward bottling single varietal wines a practice increasingly demanded by consumers in the large new world wine market
the region stretches <num> miles <num> km from the banyuls aoc at the spanish border and pyrenees in the west along the coast of the mediterranean sea to the rhone river and provence in the east
the northern boundaries of the region sit on the massif central with the cévennes mountain ranges and valleys dominating the area
many vineyards are located along the hérault river
vineyards in the languedoc are generally planted along the coastal plains of the mediterranean while those in the roussillon are to be found in the narrow valleys around the pyrenees
the peak growing season between may and august is very dry and the majority of annual rainfall occurs during the winter
in the languedoc the plains area is the most arid and hottest region of france
the region 's mediterranean climate is very conducive to growing a large amount of a wide variety of grapes with vintners in the area excelling in mass production
the average annual temperature is <num> ° f <num> ° c
the tramontane inland wind from the northwest often accentuates the dry climate drought is the most common threat to vine production with french aoc and european union regulation prohibiting the use of irrigation
in december <year> the french government responded to global warming concerns and relaxed some of the irrigation regulations
in <year> severe weather had damaging effects on the wine producing industry including hailstorms in may that affected roussillon and a rain surge in mid november that saw a year 's worth of rain fall in <num> hours in the areas of corbières and minervois in the western languedoc
the composition of soil in the languedoc varies from the chalk limestone and gravel based soils inland to more alluvial soils near the coast
some of the more highly rated vineyards are laid on top of ancient riverbed stones similar to those of châteauneuf @-@ du @-@ pape
the vast majority of languedoc wines are produced by wine cooperatives which number more than <num>
however the appellation system in the region is undergoing considerable changes with both new appellations being created and existing ones changing
one recent change is that the coteaux du languedoc has changed name to languedoc and been extended to include also the roussillon
within the larger languedoc aoc appellations are several sub @-@ districts or cru 's with distinct wine styles of their own
some of these sub @-@ districts have pending aoc applications to become appellations in their own right and some have been granted sub @-@ appellations to the umbrella appellation languedoc aoc
these include the quatourze la clape montpeyroux st
saturnin picpoul de pinet terrasses du larzac and pic st
-loup
the boundary of the eastern languedoc with the southern rhône valley wine region was moved slightly in <year> with the result that costières de nîmes aoc is now a rhône appellation rather than a languedoc one
in that year inao moved the responsibility for oversight of this appellation 's wine to the regional committee of the rhône valley
local producers of côtes du rhône @-@ styled wines made from syrah and grenache lobbied for this change since the local winemaking traditions did not coincide with administrative borders and presumably due to the greater prestige of rhône wines in the marketplace
such changes of borders between wine regions are very rare so out of habit costières de nîmes remains listed as a languedoc wine in many publications
the traditional rhône grapes of mourvedre grenache syrah and viognier are also prominent
chardonnay is a major white grape used in the vin de pays d 'oc and the sparkling crémant de limoux
others include chenin blanc and mauzac which is also the principal grape in the sparkling blanquette de limoux
the sweet fortified wines of the muscat de frontignan and muscat de st @-@ jean minervois regions are made with the muscat blanc à petits grains grapes
in the muscat de rivesaltes aoc fortified wines are made from muscat of alexandria grapes
among the reds grenache syrah carignan cinsault and mourvedre are major grapes of the corbières faugères fitou and minervois aocs
cinsault is also commonly used in rosé production along with lladoner pelut picpoul noir terret noir and grenache
grenache is also the main grape used in the fortified wines of the banyuls and rivesaltes region
some of the oldest vines in france are carignan grapes
winemakers often use carbonic maceration to soften the tannins
other varieties that can be found include roussanne marsanne vermentino bourboulenc clairette blanche grenache blanc grenache gris picpoul maccabéo and rolle
since the <num> the inao has been creating smaller aoc classifications which take into account the intricate microclimates and soil variations in the languedoc @-@ roussillon
younger appellations like the cabardes and subregions like minervois la livinière corbières @-@ boutenac and st @-@ chinian @-@ berlou are much smaller in scope
while these new appellations have been praised for consistently improving their product others have criticized the additions for further complicating an already esoteric system of classification
the majority of wine produced in the languedoc are labeled vin ordinaire
there is also sizable production of vins doux naturels
examples include vin de pays d 'oc vin de pays d 'aude vin de pays de l 'hérault and vin de pays du gard
winemakers such as guy anderson thierry boudinaud and e
j
gallo winery capitalized on this new horizon producing wines like fat bastard and red bicyclette
the majority of languedoc sweet white wines are made with a variety of muscat grapes
the red fortified wines of the banyuls are made from grenache grapes normally have an alcohol level between <num> and <num> and carry residual sugars in the <num> to <num> range
in banyuls winemakers use various methods to bake their wines to encourage deep raisin colors
some winemakers utilize a solera system of transporting the wine among different size barrels of various ages that are left out in the sun to warm
others will put the wine in large glass jars to expose it to direct sunlight
in addition to the dark color the resulting wines often have a nutty rancid taste called rancio
in the banyuls grand cru aoc the wine is required to be aged in wood barrels for two and a half years
the wines are normally composed of <num> mauzac and a <num> combination of chardonnay and chenin blanc
aoc regulations require a year of aging on the lees
the blanquette de limoux when labelled méthode ancestrale is composed entirely of mauzac undergoes only one fermentation and is aged approximately three months less on the lees before the bottling the actual date being determined by the moon 's cycle
the <num> million roller coaster was announced on december <num> <year> and opened on december <num> <year>
a first rider auction was also held where people would bid on seats to be the first riders
the track is approximately <num> @,@ <num> feet <num> m long and the lift hill is about <num> feet <num> m tall
the ride lasts two minutes and thirty seconds and features six inversions including a vertical loop cobra roll zero @-@ g roll and two corkscrews
construction for the new roller coaster began in september <year> with the relocation of the church of reflections
as part of a <num> million investment in all cedar fair parks silver bullet was announced to the public on december <num> <year>
the final piece of track was placed on september <num> <year>
on november <num> <year> knott 's berry farm launched a first rider auction in which people from anywhere in the world would bid against each other in order to be one of the first public riders on silver bullet on december <num> <year>
although sixty seats were made available only <num> of these received bids
out of those bids the highest bid was <num> us and a total of <year> was raised with all the money going to the speech language development center of buena park
after construction and testing was completed the roller coaster opened first to the media then to the public on december <num> <year> though the initial scheduled opening was on christmas eve of <year>
silver bullet was also one of four attractions that opened at knott 's berry farm in the same year and carries a western theme
after the train departs from the station it makes a <num> degree right turn before beginning to climb the <num> @-@ foot <num> m lift hill
once at the top the train goes through a pre @-@ drop before entering the <num> @-@ foot <num> m downward right drop
once at the bottom the train enters a <num> @-@ foot <num> m loop
after exiting the loop the train makes a banked right turn leading into the cobra roll
almost immediately after the train goes through a zero @-@ gravity roll followed by a downward left helix
then the train enters the first of two corkscrews which are separated by a banked left turn
next the train enters an upward left helix the beginning of the helix is close to water before entering the brake run
the train then makes a right turn into a second shorter brake run which leads straight back to the station
one cycle lasts approximately two minutes and thirty seconds
silver bullet along with all of bolliger mabillard 's other roller coasters was manufactured by clermont steel fabricators located in batavia ohio and erected by coan construction company
the track is filled with sand to reduce the noise made by the trains
silver bullet was also the first bolliger mabillard inverted roller coaster to use magnetic brakes in the brake run
the track and supports of the lift hill are red with the remaining track being yellow with red rails and the remaining supports colored white
each train has eight cars that can seat four riders in a single row for a total of <num> riders per train
the seats are coloured light blue with orange over @-@ the @-@ shoulder restraints and tri @-@ color wheel coverings red orange and yellow
he was also impressed with the ride 's smoothness and overall excitement stating that the ride is smooth and comfortable while delivering twisting stomach @-@ churning excitement
it peaked at position <num> in <year>
the roller coaster has never placed on the golden ticket awards

<num> was a single @-@ engine naval strike fighter built by blackburn aircraft for service with the british fleet air arm during world war ii
it was a development of the troubled firebrand designed to air ministry specification s
<num> <num> for an improved aircraft more suited to carrier operations
three prototypes were ordered with the company designation of b @-@ <num> and the informal name of firecrest but only two of them actually flew
the development of the aircraft was prolonged by significant design changes and slow deliveries of components but the determination by the ministry of supply in <year> that the airframe did not meet the requirements for a strike fighter doomed the aircraft
construction of two of the prototypes was continued to gain flight @-@ test data and the third was allocated to strength testing
the two flying aircraft were sold back to blackburn in <year> for disposal and the other aircraft survived until <year>
the new wing was estimated to reduce the weight of the wing by <num> lb <num> kg and increase the aircraft speed by <num> mph <num> km h
the extent of redesign increased and this led to a new fuselage and other improvements
in october <year> blackburn 's design staff led by g

<num> <num> being issued by the air ministry on <num> february <year> covering the new aircraft
the specification was designed around a bristol centaurus <num> radial engine with contra @-@ rotating propellers that allowed the size of the rudder to be reduced
the new design given the company designation b @-@ <num> was known unofficially by blackburn as the firecrest but was always known by its specification number by the air ministry and navy
it was a low @-@ winged single @-@ seat all @-@ metal monoplane
aft of the cockpit the fuselage was an oval @-@ shaped stressed @-@ skin semi @-@ monocoque but forward it had a circular @-@ section tubular @-@ steel frame
the cockpit of the firecrest was moved forward and raised the pilot 's position so that he now looked over the wing leading edge and down the nose
the canopy was adapted from the hawker tempest fighter
in the rear fuselage was a single <num> @-@ imperial @-@ gallon <num> l <num> us gal fuel tank with two <num> @-@ imperial @-@ gallon <num> l <num> us gal fuel tanks in the centre wing section
the aircraft had a redesigned thinner inverted gull wing of laminar flow aerofoil section
the wing consisted of a two @-@ spar centre section with just over <num>
<num> degrees of anhedral and outer panels with <num> degrees of dihedral
it could be hydraulically folded in two places to allow more compact storage in the hangar decks of aircraft carriers
four fowler flaps were fitted to give good low @-@ speed handling for landing and the wing had retractable dive brakes on both surfaces
in the course of the redesign the structure was simplified which reduced weight by <num> @,@ <num> lb <num> kg and even after the fuel capacity was increased by <num> imperial gallons <num> l <num> us gal the gross weight was still <num> pounds <num> kg less than that of the firebrand
work on two prototypes was authorised in november <year> but proposals for alternative engines delayed progress
in <year> it was decided that as well as adding another centaurus @-@ engined prototype there should be three prototypes with the napier e
<num> a development of the sabre as specification s
<num> <num>
the ministry believed that this would enable blackburn to develop their knowledge of aerodynamic and structural design and support the engine development at napier
however it was found that the s
<num> <num> aircraft could only be balanced if the e
<num> powerplant was placed behind the pilot
the necessary redesign and <num> @,@ <num> @-@ pound <num> kg weight increase coupled with the limited funds available to the royal navy meant that it could no longer be justified and the s
<num> <num> was cancelled on <num> october
while in final design the centaurus <num> engine with contra @-@ rotating propellers was cancelled in january <year> and a conventional <num> @,@ <num> @-@ horsepower <num> @,@ <num> kw centaurus <num> was substituted
this engine was found to require flexible mounts and was modified into the centaurus <num>
the vertical stabiliser and rudder had to be enlarged from <num> to <num> square feet <num>
<num> to <num>
<num> <num> to counteract the new engine 's torque
in september <year> a strength analysis conducted by the ministry of supply revealed that the aircraft would require strengthening to serve as a strike fighter and that a costly redesign would be required to bring it up to requirements
this would have made it comparable in weight and performance to the westland wyvern which had already flown so no contract was placed for production aircraft
delayed by the late delivery of its propeller the first prototype was rolled out at brough in february <year> and then taken by road to raf leconfield where it made its maiden flight on <num> april that year
all three prototypes were completed by the end of september and the third prototype had been modified to reduce the outer @-@ wing dihedral to <num> degrees
both the second and third prototypes remained unflown when the ministry of supply ordered that flying be ceased and work on the aircraft be stopped
later in the month however the third prototype was allocated to tests of powered aileron controls as testing of the first prototype had shown that while adequate at cruise speed the ailerons were heavy both at low and high speed
the second prototype was allocated to structural testing
the third prototype made its maiden flight in early <year> but the pace of the flight testing was leisurely with only <num> hours and <num> minutes completed by <num> november over half of which were connected with air show performances
testing concluded in march <year> when the officer in charge concluded that there was no further purpose to the tests
while the firecrest was faster than the firebrand and gave its pilot a much better view from the cockpit it was otherwise disappointing with test pilot and naval aviator captain eric brown claiming that the firecrest was even less manoeuvrable than the sluggish firebrand while the powered ailerons gave lumpy controls leading to instability in turbulent air
in particular the pilot sat near the wing 's trailing edge looking over a very long and wide nose which gave a particularly poor view for landing
the firecrest had also been rendered obsolete by the arrival of gas turbine engines and while blackburn did draw up proposals for turboprop @-@ powered derivatives of the firecrest as the b @-@ <num> y
a
<num> with the armstrong siddeley python engine these went unbuilt with orders instead going to westland for the wyvern
the two flying prototypes remained in use until <year> being sold back to blackburn in <year> and were later scrapped
<num> <num>
the airframe was sold by the controller of supplies air to blackburn on <num> april <year>
rt656 the second of two prototypes ordered on <num> january <year> it was used for structural testing before being disposed of in <year>
vf172 a third aircraft was ordered on <num> april <year> and it was used for research into power @-@ boosted ailerons during february <year>
the airframe was sold to blackburn on <num> october <year>

vijayendra prasad was watching a marathi film where two warriors sivaji and tanaji are attacked by mughal army
once the duo can reach sinhagad fort they can kill the army together effectively
while sivaji escapes to the fort for support tanaji fights with the army and dies in the process leaving sivaji in grief
prasad took this as an inspiration and wrote a story on the theme of reincarnation of a bodyguard who serves a queen
he fights <num> warriors and dies in his attempt to re @-@ enthrone his queen after she is overthrown by her conspirators
he is reborn after <num> years and fulfils his ambition of placing her on the throne by making her a chief minister or a popular social worker like medha patkar
it was subsequently rejected and after fifteen years his son director s
s
rajamouli selected this script but made several changes to it
rajamouli re @-@ characterised the queen as a princess to create a vital love story for the film as he felt that the relationship between a queen and a bodyguard would be only about loyalty and honesty
production for the film was officially launched on <num> march <year> at fncc in hyderabad

m
rathnam was announced as the dialogue writer while rajamouli 's usual associates k
k
senthil kumar kotagiri venkateswara rao and m
m
keeravani worked on the film 's cinematography editing and music respectively
after many potential titles magadheera was considered and finalised in early february <year>
tamil and malayalam dubbed versions were planned in mid february <year>
the film 's tamil dubbed version was titled as maaveeran named after the <year> tamil film
geetha arts collaborated with udhayanidhi stalin for the tamil version and distributed it under his production banner red giant movies
k
bhagyaraj wrote the dialogues for maaveeran
the malayalam version was titled dheera — the warrior and was distributed by pallavi films
rajamouli said that he wanted to cast her as the female lead in yamadonga <year> after her telugu debut lakshmi kalyanam <year> but she was unavailable
he added that he wanted somebody good looking who would look like a princess and who had dates available and finalised her because she met all of these prerequisites
after conducting her photoshoot rajamouli explained the story and mithra 's characterisation to her in <num> minutes
he said she needed to treat the hero arrogantly but do so out of love for the hero
kajal kept this in mind and acted accordingly while playing the dual roles of a princess from <num> years ago and a modern @-@ day college student
kajal called both her roles unique and challenging
dev gill was selected to portray the film 's antagonist
rajamouli was criticised for selecting him considering gill 's previous film krishnarjuna <year> but remained adamant about casting him
he said that he had to cast a good looking man as the film 's villain because the heroine needed to find him trustworthy
for this film gill had to practice horse riding in ramoji film city ram charan was already an experienced equestrian
srihari was cast in his role in the film in early april <year>
kim sharma was selected to perform one of the two item numbers in the film in early june <year>

mumaith khan was selected for another item number a remix version of the hit song bangaru kodipetta from gharana mogudu <year> gharana mogudu 's music was also composed by m
m
keeravani
chiranjeevi made a special appearance after the song making magadheera the first film he appeared in after his entry into politics
when rajamouli suggested the idea of a cameo appearance chiranjeevi was initially hesitant till the director narrated the complete sequence and the importance of the song
when i was told of the characterization of ‘ kalabhairava ’ i had an impression of a young passionate soldier and naturally it had to have a great body and an authoritative voice
so we also worked on it
we actually went to rajasthan and observed the local culture and their way of dressing we researched a lot about their costumes history and great personalities <num> years ago and planned it accordingly
ram charan sported a long hairdo for both of his characters in the film
to design the armour used by charan in his role as kalabhairava art director r
ravinder wanted the precise measurements of charan 's body they used plaster of paris to make a mould of charan 's body shape from which they created a statue
they designed costumes for the statue and had charan try them on once they were satisfied with the designs
in an interview with radhika rajamani of rediff
com the film 's stylist rama rajamouli said that it took one month to develop the right look for the olden period before she began working on the materials and costumes for the film
she added that all of the film 's costumes were designed by her and stitched in hyderabad and that kajal 's costumes were heavily detailed as she needed to look rich elegant and bright
rajamouli had some disagreements with cinematographer k
k
senthil kumar over the colours of the costumes
her decision of having kajal wear a dress of baby pink and pista green during the war sequence at bhairavakona was initially opposed by rajamouli but later agreed to after the director saw the final edit
she also used minimal jewellery for the princess 's outfits
initial shooting occurred for <num> days in rann of kutch gujarat
art director ravinder went to chennai and gave details of their requirements to a prominent chariot @-@ making specialist
after rejecting the maker 's first iron skeletons ravinder opted to design them himself and prepared three models of chariots with different heights to be used depending on the camera ’ s location and other technical requirements
he used fibre material for the iron skeleton 's exteriors
for a scene in which neither the hero nor the villain was present on the chariot ravinder measured a short person and designed a hidden chamber in which he could sit and secretly control the horses
while the chariot race sequence was shot in dholavira the sequence in which the chariot sinks in quicksand was shot at a set comprising three acres in ramoji film city
k
k
senthil kumar scouted for locations in gujarat looking for dry open lands to shoot the chariot race sequence
they found salt lands with white sands in dholavira
to shoot the sequence there they wanted a light weight vehicle to follow the horses they bought a maruti van removed the vehicle 's top and mounted the camera along with a jimmy jib atop it
a part of the song dheera dheera was also shot there requiring filmmakers to plant a dry tree and a couple of oxen for use in the song 's backdrop
an item number featuring kim sharma and ram charan was shot in late june <year> in a specially erected fisherman colony
it was set up on the first floor of annapurna studios and cost less than ₹ <num> million
ravinder explained the set should look like an outdoor location but need to be constructed in an indoor floor
i constructed exteriors of around <num> houses in that floor with detailed interior plan for the house of srihari
i also constructed a small boat and a big wheeled fish with thermocol
when director wanted smoke @-@ effect for a shot i held the heavy smoke machine on my shoulders in a low angle for the required effect
after filming key parts of the film in rajasthan suburbs of hyderabad and at badami in karnataka filming continued in ramoji film city in a specially erected set named bhairavakona in late october <year>
two more schedules one from <num> – <num> december and one in january were also shot at the bhairavakona set
the sequence of charan killing <num> warriors also at bhairavakona included a bridge
as the set did not permit for shooting with low angles a separate half @-@ bridge was erected at bhoot bangla in road no
<num> of banjara hills
the bridge which had a height of <num> feet <num> m and a length of <num> feet <num> m was constructed on top of a rocky hill using steel beams as the skeleton and wooden material as support
it was built in around <num> days by over <num> men amid heavy rains
<num> trucks of black soil were transported from ramoji film city for the bridge set as that type of soil was only available in the former location
after the completion of shooting at the arena set in ramoji film city the arena set was demolished and a set for heroine 's house was constructed in its place
this was the last set constructed for this film
by late september <year> <num> of the film 's shoot was complete
the remix version of bangaru kodipetta was shot by ram charan and mumaith khan under the supervision of prem rakshith at chennai port although visakhapatnam port was first considered
filming continued in and around hyderabad very discreetly in november <year>
stunt sequences by ram charan and some stuntmen were shot in mid @-@ december <year> at hyderabad
by mid february <year> the film 's scripted part had been wrapped up with only some songs left to shoot
the song nakosam nuvvu was shot in switzerland while panchadara bomma bomma was shot at golkonda fort in hyderabad
both songs were duets shot by ram charan and kajal
k
k
senthil kumar said in an interview that magadheera could not have been made in eight months because of its long pre @-@ production and post @-@ production phases
over two lakhs worth of props including swords daggers knives bows and arrows pouches armour footwear and other accessories were used in the film
they were designed by <num> workers including welders molders carpenters painters cobblers artists tailors and leather men who worked for two months in the geetha arts studio
five people were appointed exclusively to look after these props
however during the film 's shoot both peter hein and ram charan suffered major injuries
the former fell down from a height of <num> — <num> feet during the composition of a stunt and was advised a bed rest for four months
charan faced severe leg fractures while rajamouli said that peter met with an accident on the sets had two broken ribs fractured hands and jaw and lost all his teeth
within a month he was back on the sets with his face and body covered in bandages and plaster
he could barely lift his hands to shoot
c
kamalakannan was the vfx producer of this film
magadheera was the first telugu film in which the position of visual effects producer was used in the credits
he was assisted by a team of five experts from abroad and a <num> dedicated group members apart from <num> people from the company efx in chennai and hyderabad
special effects and cg was used for about <num> hour and <num> minutes out of the total <num> hours and <num> minutes in the film
<num> of the frames in the film 's scenes of udayghad city were actually shot with a camera the rest were cg extension
for the scenes in the stadium cg extension was slightly above <num>
for the stadium italian concept artist marco rolandi began with a cad drawing and made his first 3d concept in <num> days
it took five months for marco to reach the design shown in the film and as imagined by rajamouli
simultaneously iranian 3d technical director adel adili who worked with kamalakannan for anji <year> yamadonga and arundathi <year> was working on the 3d udayghad city
he started with a city @-@ plan and added streets buildings mountains temples palaces water bodies a huge waterfall rivers gates a moat and trees all of which were planned and received rajamouli 's approval before being executed to full scale
adili redesigned marco 's 3d stadium to suit indian aesthetics and made it fit perfectly within the city
pete draper who worked with kamalakanna in ghajini <year> was selected as the pipeline technical director of the film
at that time kamalakannan was in iran finalising the cg stadium and city with adili
the majority of the film was shot in anamorphic format but a super <num> camera gate and lens were used for the stadium episode to minimise distortion
post @-@ production of the stadium scenes were given to prasad efx and the film set up their own render farm in chennai
the post process was done in several stages after the scan
the live stadium had only <num> steps in which live people were positioned in <num> steps while the remaining <num> steps were cg extension
adili created 3d cg people to fill the cg steps and their actions in a library of <num> frames
draper designed the birds in two flows one flow kept flying around the stadium while the other flow took off from a position dome and landed on a target dome
rajamouli used those birds in several shots
upon finishing the stages of the stadium composite kamalakannan flew to iran again to work with adel for the 3d city shots which were created entirely in cg
adili designed 3d horses for the hero and villain and draper designed the 3d people flocking behind the horses
about adili 's work kamalakannan said when we started the city @-@ shot renders it has taken several hours to render one frame
but adili re @-@ corrected the geometry and applied several path breaking ideas so even on <num> july just a week before the film release we were able to do corrections render and submit
₹ <num> million us <num> @,@ <num> was spent solely on vfx for magadheera
the filmmakers filed a case at hayathnagar police station
security personnel and film unit members searched but failed to recover the reels
rajamouli 's unit said it was not important if the scenes from the can were aired online since they were not crucial scenes were all on a blue matte and lacked finishing
later raw footage from the film was seen on the internet but no details about the culprits were found
after the photographs and small video clips were leaked on the internet some of the film unit members felt that the loss might have been a ploy on the part of the producers to create hype
according to rediff the rewritten script 's basic storyline is that love remains eternal and it will follow generations and generations
there is always a big victory for love
the film 's flashback sequences were used as a flip switch between the film 's olden and present day eras
initially the film featured a scene in which the present day heroine accidentally receives a dupatta preserved in a museum that is used in the flashbacks as the dupatta bhairava and ranadheer race for
however separate dupattas were used in the film as rajamouli felt that getting the dupatta from the flashback would complicate the narrative
in her book bimal roy 's madhumati untold stories from behind the scenes writer rinki bhattacharya compared the reincarnation theme of magadheera with that of madhumati <year> karz <year> karan arjun <year> and om shanti om <year>
touching the heroine unleashes locked memories within the hero that transport him to rajasthan in <year> from contemporary hyderabad
bhattacharya also compared magadheera to another telugu film mooga manasulu <year>
rajamouli told subhash k
jha that he was inspired by karan arjun to make films based on reincarnation
m

the proceeds of <num> screens were given to him while the rest was confiscated by the chamber of commerce
the kfcc also suspended vijaykumar who was kfcc 's secretary for distribution from its executive committee
joint collector gaurav uppal convened a meeting of film exhibitors and distributors warning them against black @-@ marketing tickets to magadheera
this was after local leaders attempting to acquire a maximum number of tickets blocked and booked tickets to the film in advance to enthuse their supporters during the local civic polls in guntur
special teams of revenue police and commercial tax officers were appointed to keep watch at ticket counters and ensure that each person was issued only one ticket
priority was ordered to be given for the sanitation safety and comfort of the viewers

however ram charan 's fans resorted to sloganeering and an impromptu protest demonstration in the office of revenue divisional officer k
hymavathi in machilipatnam
they demanded the screening of a benefit show and the advance sale of tickets after being rejected by the management of the twin theatres siri venkata and siri krishna where the film was screened

activists of pdsu pow and pyl staged a protest demonstration in front of the ashok <num> mm theatre in nizamabad where the film was screened to demand the removal of the song
the protesters said that the song was written by rao during the famous srikakulam armed struggle four decades prior and had been misused to portray an obscene duet in the film
they added that the song was used without the permission of the writer and that the depiction defeated the very purpose of the song which was written in a revolutionary spirit
they demanded a public apology by the makers to rao
a few reports stated that rao demanded aravind pay him compensation of ₹ <num> million
after the completion of the film 's <num> day run novelist s

he demanded that filmmakers compensate him for using his idea without consent and threatened to take legal action if the producers did not heed his demands or remade the film in another language
he added that he deserved to be credited for the story and alleged that allu arjun and allu sirish were trying to postpone his acknowledgment by discussing the issue with him
during the release announcement allu sirish said that although they initially were reluctant to go for it given the fact that there were approximately only <num> blu @-@ ray devices in andhra pradesh the overwhelming demand for it made him rethink the decision
he added sharing this vision with us was sri balaji videos the largest home @-@ video label in andhra pradesh

rajamouli has chosen a fantastic love story for his movie magadheera and linked it to a love story that dated back to some <num> years
he has filled complete energy in the film and no doubt the graphic works and modern technology are perfectly used for the movie
as a whole the film reminds the audiences of watching a hollywood movie with perfect local flavor and called the film 's screenplay by rajamouli a highlight
upperstall
com stated magadheera is not an epic not a legend not even a cult movie but it is certainly an artistic extravaganza and a sensory treat
like we said before a must watch a mast watch
radhika rajamani of rediff
com called the film technically brilliant and wrote a reincarnation story is not often seen in telugu cinema and ss rajamouli uses this theme for ram charan teja 's second film magadheera
it 's a magnum opus production with great technical work
the graphics are excellent for a telugu movie
overall the movie is a mainstream one with good packaging
she rated the film <num> out of <num>
sify called the film a brilliant entertainer and wrote set against the backdrop of an eerie theme — reincarnation — magadheera unfolds on the screen with multiple shades of entertainment
when the movie was launched last year director rajamouli dared to reveal the central theme of the story
he has succeeded in his attempt as he was able to keep the screenplay and narration gripping from start to finish
the second half has the soul in it
sify summarised in short the movie encompasses some of the best commercial elements that telugu audience have seen in the recent past
indiaglitz called the film royal and spellbinding and opined the film deserves a special credit for many reasons notable among them is the grandeur of the movie and the amazing technical aspects
this is surely a path breaker in terms of telugu film making and with the likes of arundhati tollywood sure is proud to have this one in its league
it is a valiant attempt to bring such genre to the modern day audience and present it with finesse so that it fits the historical angle and the today 's angle

s
rajamouli to stardom
dev gill attained stardom with this film and went on to work in several south indian films as an antagonist
after the release of magadheera people began recognising him as ranadheer
according to writer gopimohan magadheera started a trend of experimentation with period socio @-@ fantasy and spiritual themes that was continued in films like panchakshari <year> nagavalli <year> anaganaga o dheerudu <year> mangala <year> sri rama rajyam <year> and uu kodathara ulikki padathara <year>

after magadheera s
s
rajamouli worked on a small budget film maryada ramanna <year> which according to crazy mohan was similar to the act of s
s
vasan directing the small budget film mr
sampat <year> after chandralekha <year>
rajamouli explained his decision by saying i decided that my next project would be maryada ramanna during the magadheera shooting itself because it is a <num> and half year project that demands lot of physical labor and mental strain
i didn 't want to commit another physically exhausting film immediately after magadheera
maryada ramanna gave us time to recharge our batteries so that we could come up with another huge project
he revealed maryada ramanna 's plot before its launch to minimise the expectations of his audience after magadheera 's success
tammareddy bharadwaja said ever since arundhati and magadheera did well at the box office the rest of the industry started following their footsteps
also since there is an irrational craze to make high budget films right now producers are turning towards mythological films
it is the only genre where you can boast of spending crores for creating the sets and the look of the film
but what they don 't realize is that if these films flop the blow to the producer will be severe
films like anaganaga o dheerudu <year> and shakti <year> were commercial failures and badrinath <year> was an average grosser all being fantasy films in which the protagonist is a warrior
the promos of badrinath looked similar to magadheera and the former 's director v
v
vinayak along with its male lead allu arjun kept insisting that badrinath is dissimilar to magadheera
producer natti kumar said if a hero delivers a hit producers run after him for five years and burn their fingers only after six or eight flops
it 's the same story with movies
since magadheera became a hit every other hero and director wants to do period film where there is scope to spend crores
they don 't work on the script story or relevance
it is a pure display of graphics heroes abs and grandeur
the plot is lost
magadheera worked because it was a novel genre then but why will people want to see the same things again
janani iyer cited the character of mithravinda played by kajal in the film as one of her dream roles
ram gopal varma refused to call magadheera a film and instead termed it as an event that comes once in a blue moon
while commenting on mahesh babu 's aagadu <year> he said that magadheera looked like a <num> crore film when compared to aagadu if the latter was a <num> crore film and added my comparison between aagadu and magadheera is mainly because they both are the most expensive films for their own individual times
reviewing the tamil film anegan <year> few critics opined that the film had traces of magadheera mainly due to the theme of reincarnation
the tamil dubbed version of the telugu film yevadu <year> which featured charan in one of the lead roles and kajal in a crucial cameo was titled magadheera
the film also won six filmfare awards nine nandi awards and ten cinemaa awards
in an interview with the times of india charan said when i met anil kapoor some time back he told me i will ask boney kapoor to remake magadheera with you in hindi
but i said i don 't know if i would want to do the remake
magadheera is a lovely film which can 't be recreated
the film was remade in bengali as yoddha the warrior in <year> it was directed by raj chakraborty with dev and mimi chakraborty playing the lead roles
the <year> kannada film brahma according to its director r
chandru was inspired by magadheera but was not a remake
in august <year> shahid kapoor expressed his desire to reprise ram charan 's role in a hindi remake saying i have been wanting to do magadheera for the longest
i have seen the film and loved it
i think it ’ s a killer subject
in late november <year> sajid nadiadwala confirmed that he would direct the film 's hindi remake with kapoor as the lead
when asked by subhash k
jha the reason for not directing the hindi remake rajamouli said i 've already spent two years of my life on it
i ’ d rather make something else
magadheera was my toughest film to make
very tiring

the battle took place in phước tuy province now part of bà rịa – vũng tàu province south vietnam
the year of <year> marked a decisive turning point in the vietnam war
following the ousting of president ngô đình diệm in <year> south vietnam 's top army generals continued to vie with each other for control of the country ’ s military @-@ dominated government instead of combating the emerging forces of the national liberation front also known as the viet cong
the fragility of the south vietnamese government was reflected on the battlefield where its military experienced great setbacks against the viet cong
taking advantage of saigon 's political instability communist leaders in hanoi began preparing for war
even though key members of north vietnam 's politburo disagreed on the best strategy to reunite their country they ultimately went ahead to prepare for armed struggle against south vietnam and their american supporters
towards the end of <year> the national liberation front commenced a series of large @-@ scale military operations against the army of the republic of vietnam as ordered by the north vietnamese government
as part of their winter @-@ spring offensive the viet cong unleashed its newly created <num> division against the south vietnamese forces at bình giã fighting a large set @-@ piece battle for the first time
over a period of four days the viet cong <num> division held its ground and mauled the best units the south vietnamese army could send against them only breaking after intense attack by u
s
bombers
following the coup that ousted ngô đình diệm the military situation quickly worsened as the national liberation front nlf also known as viet cong gained significant ground in the countryside because the military revolutionary council which governed south vietnam lacked direction both in terms of policy and planning
furthermore general dương văn minh as the chairman of the military revolutionary council and his civilian prime minister nguyễn ngọc thơ favoured a political resolution instead of using military force which brought them into conflict with the united states over the best strategy to end the communist threat in south vietnam
as a result both men became increasingly unpopular among the military generals who held real political power in saigon
on january <num> <year> general nguyễn khánh successfully ousted dương văn minh from the military revolutionary council without firing a single shot
for much of the year khánh spent most of his efforts on consolidating political power instead of fighting the viet cong
in contrast to the political unrest in saigon the communist leadership in north vietnam were far more concerned about the best strategy to fight the south vietnamese government and their american supporters
while all leaders in hanoi shared the same goal of eventual reunification of their homeland different factions within the communist party disagreed on the best method to achieve their desired goal
members of north vietnam 's politburo were divided by the issues surrounding the soviet strategy of peaceful co @-@ existence versus the chinese strategy of supporting national liberation movements in emerging countries
despite their differences of opinion the communist party leadership ultimately made preparations for armed struggle in south vietnam
from hanoi 's perspective the military regime in saigon was able to hold out because the communist main forces were still not ready to fight a conventional war so north vietnam must focus on the development of its military force in the shortest period of time
in the meantime however the war must be kept at its current level in order to prevent the full involvement of the united states military
on october <num> <year> the national liberation front in south vietnam was ordered to carry out a series of military operations as part of the communist winter @-@ spring offensive
the nlf nam bo mekong delta regional command established a sub @-@ command under the leadership of trần đình xu with nguyễn hòa as the deputy commander and lê trọng tấn as the political commissar
their mission was to inflict damage on the regular units of the army of the republic of vietnam arvn and destroy the strategic hamlets constructed by the former ngô đình diệm regime
the national liberation front in south vietnam identified the regions of bình long @-@ phước long and bà rịa @-@ long khánh along route <num> as the main targets for their offensive
meanwhile the central military commission in hanoi appointed general nguyen chi thanh as the commander of north vietnamese military operations in southern vietnam
other high @-@ ranking officers such as major generals lê trọng tấn and trần độ and colonel hoàng cầm were sent to south vietnam to supervise the military build @-@ up which would commence in november <year>
during the first phase of their campaign the viet cong regiments overran several strategic hamlets at xan sang cam xe dong xa and thai khai
between august and september <year> viet cong regiments executed deep thrusts into bình dương and châu thành to apply additional pressure on south vietnamese outposts situated on route <num>
during the second phase of their campaign the viet cong ambushed two south vietnamese infantry companies and destroyed five armoured vehicles which consisted of <num> chaffee light tanks and m @-@ <num> apcs
the plaf defeated regular south vietnamese units at the strategic hamlets of bình mỹ and bình co
following the completion of the initial stages in their campaign the viet cong forces were ordered to regroup and prepare for the next offensive in the long khánh region
viet cong soldiers from the two regiments were assembled in war zone d where they were trained to attack well @-@ fortified enemy strongholds
on november <num> <year> the viet cong reached the long khánh battlefield having completed a <num> kilometres march from war zone d
on the battlefield the viet cong <num> battalion from military region <num> the <num> and <num> battalions from military region <num> and the <num> company also joined the offensive
to kick @-@ start their offensive in the baria @-@ long khánh region the viet cong selected bình giã as their next target
bình giã was a small village located in phước tuy province about <num> kilometres away from south vietnam 's capital of saigon
during the war about <num> @,@ <num> people lived in bình giã and most of whom were staunchly anti @-@ communist
the inhabitants of bình giã were roman catholic refugees who had fled from north vietnam in <year> during operation passage to freedom because of fears of communist persecution
to prepare for their main battle the viet cong <num> regiment was ordered to block inter @-@ provincial road no
<num> and <num> and destroy any south vietnamese units attempting to reach bình giã from the south @-@ western flank of the battlefield
in the days leading up to the battle the viet cong often came out to harass the local militia forces
on december <num> <year> the <num> regiment destroyed an entire south vietnamese mechanised rifle company along inter @-@ provincial road no
<num> destroying <num> m @-@ <num> apcs
on december <num> the <num> regiment destroyed another six armoured vehicles on inter @-@ provincial road no
<num>
there they clashed with members of the south vietnamese popular force militiamen which numbered about <num> personnel
the south vietnamese militia fighters proved no match for the viet cong and their overwhelming firepower so they quickly retreated into underground bunkers and called for help
once the village was captured colonel ta minh kham the viet cong regimental commander established his command post in the main village church and waited for fresh reinforcements which came in the form of heavy mortars machine guns and recoil @-@ less rifles
to counter south vietnamese helicopter assaults colonel kham 's troops set up a network of defensive fortifications around the village with trenches and bunkers protected by land mines and barbed wire
the local catholic priest who was also the village chief sent a bicycle messenger out to the bà rịa district headquarters to ask for a relief force
in response the bà rịa district chief sent out elements of two vietnamese rangers battalions to retake bình giã
on december <num> two companies of the arvn <num> ranger battalion and a company from the <num> ranger battalion were airlifted into area located west of bình giã by helicopters from the u
s
<num> aviation company to face an enemy force of unknown size
however as soon as the soldiers from the <num> and <num> ranger battalions arrived at the landing zone they were quickly overwhelmed by the viet cong in a deadly ambush
the entire <num> ranger battalion was then committed to join the attack but they too did not initially succeed in penetrating the strong viet cong defensive lines
several more companies of the rangers then arrived for an attack from multiple directions
two companies of the <num> ranger battalion advanced from the northeast
one of them came to the outskirts of the village but was unable to break through the enemy defenses
the other one trying to outflank the enemy had been lured into a kill zone in open terrain at the coffee plantation and were quickly obliterated in an ambush by the three vc battalions using heavy weapons
the two companies suffered a <num> percent casualty rate and survivors were forced to retreat to the nearby catholic church
the <num> rangers had more success by assaulting from the western direction and succeeded in fighting their way into the village aided by local residents
it however also suffered heavy losses with the battalion commander and his american adviser severely wounded
the local civilians in bình giã retrieved weapons and ammunition from the dead rangers and hid the wounded government soldiers from the viet cong
the <num> ranger battalion on the other hand landed on the battlefield unopposed by the viet cong and they immediately advanced on bình giã from the south
soldiers from the <num> rangers spent the whole day fighting but they could not break through their enemies defences to link up with the survivors hiding in the church and fell back after calling in mortar fire to decimate viet cong fighters moving to encircle them
the morning of december <num> the <num> south vietnamese marine battalion moved out to biên hòa air base waiting to be airlifted into the battlefield
the <num> <num> marine battalion was the first unit to arrive on the outskirts of bình giã but the 1st company commander decided to secure the landing zone to wait for the rest of the battalion to arrive instead of moving on to their objective
after the rest of the <num> marine battalion had arrived they marched towards the catholic church to relieve the besieged rangers
about one and a half hours later the <num> marine battalion linked up with the <num> <num> and <num> ranger battalions as the viet cong began withdrawing to the northeast
that afternoon the <num> marine battalion recaptured the village but the viet cong was nowhere to be seen as all their units had withdrawn from the village during the previous night linking with other viet cong elements in the forest to attack the government relief forces
on the evening of december <num> the viet cong returned bình giã and attacked from the south @-@ eastern perimeter of the village
the local villagers who discovered the approaching viet cong immediately sounded the alarm to alert the arvn soldiers defending the village
the south vietnamese were able to repel the viet cong with support from u
s
army helicopter gunships flown out from vung tau airbase
while pursuing the viet cong a helicopter gunship from the u
s
<num> assault helicopter company was shot down and crashed in the quảng giao rubber plantation about four kilometres away from bình giã killing four of its crewmen
on december <num> the u
s
marines advisory group sent a team of four personnel led by captain donald g
cook to bình giã to observe conditions on the battlefield
at the same time the <num> marine battalion was ordered to locate the crashed helicopter and recover the bodies of the dead american crewmen
acting against the advice of his american advisor major nguyễn văn nho commander of the <num> marine battalion sent his <num> <num> marine battalion company out to the quảng giao rubber plantation
unknown to the <num> marine battalion the viet cong 271st regiment had assembled in the plantation
about one hour after they had departed from the village of bình giã the commander of the <num> <num> marine battalion reported via radio that his troops had found the helicopter wreckage and the bodies of four american crewmen
shortly afterwards the viet cong opened fire and the <num> <num> marine battalion was forced to pull back
in an attempt to save the <num> company the entire <num> marine battalion was sent out to confront the viet cong
as the lead element of the <num> marine battalion closed in on the quảng giao plantation they were hit by accurate viet cong artillery fire which was soon followed by repeated human wave attacks
having absorbed heavy casualties from the viet cong 's ambush the <num> <num> marine battalion had to fight their way out of the plantation with their bayonets fixed
during the entire ordeal the company did not receive artillery support because the plantation was beyond the range of <num> artillery guns based in phước tuy and bà rịa
they however escaped with the crucial support of the u
s
aircraft and helicopters whose rocket attacks forced the enemy to pull back and halted their attempt at pursuit
in the morning of december <num> the <num> marines battalion returned to the crash site with the entire force and the american graves were located and their corpses were dug up
at about <num> pm a single u
s
helicopter arrived on the battlefield to evacuate the casualties but they only picked up the bodies of the four american crewmen while south vietnamese casualties were forced to wait for another helicopter to arrive
at <num> pm major nguyễn văn nho ordered the <num> marine battalion to carry their casualties back to the village instead of continuing to wait for the helicopters
as the <num> marine battalion began their return march three viet cong battalions with artillery support suddenly attacked them from three directions
the battalion 's commanding and executive officers were immediately killed and air support was not available
two arvn marine companies managed to fight their way out of the ambush and back to bình giã but the third was overrun and almost completely wiped out
the fourth company desperately held out at a hilltop against viet cong artillery barrages and large infantry charges before slipping out through the enemy positions at dawn
the <num> marines battalion of <num> men lost a total of <num> soldiers killed <num> wounded and <num> missing
among the casualties were <num> officers of the <num> marine battalion killed in action and the four american advisers attached to the unit were also wounded
backed by u
s
air force bombers on january <num> three battalions of arvn airborne reinforcements arrived they were too late as most of the viet cong had already withdrawn from the battlefield
it was the first time the national liberation front launched a large @-@ scale operation holding its ground and fighting for four days against government troops equipped with armor artillery and helicopters and aided by u
s
air support and military advisers
the viet cong demonstrated that when well @-@ supplied with military supplies from north vietnam they had the ability to fight and inflict damage even on the best arvn units
for the first time in their history the nlf was able to control a government stronghold for several days and inflict heavy casualties on regular units of the south vietnamese army in a large set @-@ piece battle
the viet cong suffered light casualties with only <num> soldiers officially confirmed killed and they did not leave a single casualty on the battlefield
in recognition of the 271st regiment 's performance during the bình giã campaign the nlf high command bestowed the title bình giã regiment on the unit to honour their achievement
following the bình giã campaign the nlf went on to occupy hoài đức district and the strategic hamlets of đất đỏ long thành and nhơn trạch along inter @-@ provincial road no
<num> and <num>
they also expanded the hát dịch base area which was located in bà rịa and bình thuận provinces to protect the important sea transportation routes used by the vietnam people 's navy to supply viet cong units around the regions of the mekong river
unlike their adversaries the south vietnamese military suffered heavily in their attempts to recapture the village of bình giã and secure the surrounding areas
the south vietnamese and their american allies lost the total of about <num> personnel killed in action <num> wounded and <num> missing
in just four days of fighting two of south vietnam 's elite ranger companies were destroyed and several others suffered heavy losses while the <num> marine battalion was rendered ineffective as a fighting force
at that stage of the war bình giã was the worst defeat experienced by any south vietnamese army
despite the humiliating defeat inflicted on them the south vietnamese army stubbornly considered the battle as their victory and erected a monument at the site of the battle to acknowledge the sacrifices of the soldiers who had fallen to retake bình giã
as the ndh imposed its authority members of the fascist ustaše ruling party began a campaign of persecution against serbs throughout the country
in eastern herzegovina the ustaše perpetrated a series of massacres and attacks against the majority serb population commencing in the first week of june
between <num> and <num> june <year> spontaneous clashes occurred between ndh authorities and groups of serbs in the region
the german invasion of the soviet union began on <num> june
over the next two days the sporadic revolts by serbs against the ndh in eastern herzegovina erupted into mass rebellion triggered by ustaše persecution serb solidarity with the russian people hatred and fear of the ndh authorities and other factors
serb rebels under the leadership of both local serbs and montenegrins attacked police gendarmerie ustaše and croatian home guard forces in the region
in the first few days the rebels captured gendarmerie posts in several villages set up roadblocks on the major roads and ambushed several military vehicles
on the night of <num> june the rebels mounted a sustained attack on the town of nevesinje in an attempt to capture it but the garrison held out until the morning of <num> june when ndh troops broke through the rebel roadblocks
on <num> june the rebels ambushed a truckload of italian soldiers prompting the italian army commander in the ndh to warn the ndh government that he would take unilateral action to secure communication routes
a further gendarmerie post was destroyed by the rebels and in the evening the rebels captured the village of avtovac looting and burning it and killing dozens of non @-@ serb civilians
the following day an italian column cleared the rebels from avtovac and relieved the hard @-@ pressed ndh garrison in the town of gacko
from <num> july an ndh force of over <num> @,@ <num> fanned out from nevesinje clearing towns villages and routes of rebels
the rebel forces did not put up any significant opposition to the clearing operation and either retreated into nearby montenegro or hid their weapons in the mountains and went home
by <num> july ndh forces had regained full control of all towns and major transport routes in eastern herzegovina
the ndh consisted of most of modern @-@ day croatia and bosnia and herzegovina together with some parts of modern @-@ day serbia
it was essentially an italo – german quasi @-@ protectorate as it owed its existence to the axis powers who maintained occupation forces within the puppet state throughout its existence
in the immediate aftermath of the yugoslav surrender on <num> april former royal yugoslav army troops returned to their homes in eastern herzegovina with their weapons
this was a significant security concern for the fledgling ndh government due to the proximity of the border with montenegro the close relationship between the people of eastern herzegovina and montenegro and widespread banditry in the region
on the day after the surrender the commander of the ndh armed forces vojskovođa marshal slavko kvaternik issued a proclamation demanding the surrender of all weapons to ndh authorities by <num> april
on <num> april the ndh created five military command areas including bosnia command and adriatic command both of which were initially headquartered in sarajevo
each of the five military commands included several district commands
adriatic command included the districts of knin and sinj in the dalmatian hinterland and mostar and trebinje in eastern herzegovina
the ndh began to mobilise soldiers for the home guard with six battalions identified to join adriatic command
the battalions were mobilised from areas outside of eastern herzegovina and were to be ready by <num> may
the aggressive actions of the ustaše fifth column during the axis invasion made serb civilian leaders in eastern herzegovina apprehensive about the ndh and they attempted to obtain italian protection and urged the italians to annex eastern herzegovina to the neighboring italian @-@ occupied territory of montenegro
a collaborationist interim advisory committee of montenegrin separatists was advocating the establishment of an independent montenegrin state and a similar committee of separatist serbs was formed in eastern herzegovina
a delegation from that committee arrived in cetinje in montenegro on <num> may to ask for italian protection
similarly a delegation of muslims from eastern herzegovina travelled to sarajevo the historic bosnian capital to urge the ndh authorities to link eastern herzegovina to that city
due to the poor response to the demand for the surrender of weapons the deadline was extended several times until a date of <num> july was fixed
on <num> may courts @-@ martial were established to try those that were arrested in possession of weapons and those found guilty were immediately executed by firing squad
the precedent for this brutal repressive measure against serbs had already been established by the germans
it was clear from the outset that the ndh weapons laws were not being enforced as strictly against croats as they were against serbs
securing the border between eastern herzegovina and montenegro was considered a high priority due to concerns that the montenegrin federalist party had revived montenegrin claims to parts of the ndh that had been promised to the kingdom of montenegro in the <year> treaty of london
the italians handed over the administration of eastern herzegovina to the ndh government on <num> may <year> following the signing of the treaties of rome which ceded formerly yugoslav territory along the adriatic coast to italy
the italians did not immediately withdraw all their troops from the region
the ndh moved quickly to establish its authority in the towns and districts of eastern herzegovina which included appointing mayors and prefects the creation of local units of the ustaše militia and deploying hundreds of gendarmes croatian home guards and ustaše militia units from outside eastern herzegovina
these forces were brought in to maintain order
the academic professor alija šuljak was appointed the ustaše commissioner for eastern herzegovina
on <num> may the recently formed home guard battalions began to deploy into the adriatic command area
on <num> may <num> officers and <num> gendarmes of the sarajevo @-@ based <num> gendarmerie regiment were deployed into parts of eastern herzegovina
they established platoon strength posts in nevesinje trebinje gacko and bileća with their headquarters also in bileća
the dubrovnik @-@ based <num> gendarmerie regiment established posts in stolac and berkovići
the headquarters of adriatic command was transferred to mostar in late may and general ivan prpić was appointed as its commander
by <num> may the battalions of adriatic command were in their garrison locations the <num> battalion at mostar the <num> battalion at trebinje and the <num> battalion in the dubrovnik area
the other two adriatic command battalions were deployed to knin and sinj far to the west
the <num> battalion was allocated as a reserve and was garrisoned in mostar
main ustaše headquarters was tasked to recruit one battalion for duties within the adriatic command area
home guard battalions had a standard structure consisting of a headquarters company three infantry companies a machine gun platoon and a communications section while battalions of the ustaše militia consisted of a headquarters three companies and a motorised section
even after the establishment of ndh authorities in eastern herzegovina italian forces maintained their presence in the region
the <num> regiment of the <num> infantry division marche remained garrisoned in trebinje with the <num> regiment based in mostar
the <num> mvsn legion blackshirts were also stationed in bileća
the italians maintained a troop presence in nevesinje until <num> june and conducted almost daily motorised patrols throughout eastern herzegovina
the ndh authorities established new administrative sub @-@ divisions organising the state into counties croatian velike župe and then districts croatian kotar
eastern herzegovina was covered by the counties of hum and dubrava
hum county included the districts of mostar and nevesinje and dubrava county included the districts of bileća gacko stolac ravno and trebinje
the župan county prefect of hum was josip trajer with his seat in mostar and the župan of dubrava was ante buć based in dubrovnik
according to the yugoslav census of <year> the population of eastern herzegovina comprised <num> per cent croats <num> per cent muslims and <num> per cent serbs
according to professor jozo tomasevich the estimated population of the districts of bileća gacko and nevesinje was only around <num>
<num> per cent croat so in those areas nearly all the ndh government appointments and local ustaše units were staffed by muslims an ethnic group that made up about <num>
<num> per cent of the local population
the poor muslim peasants of eastern herzegovina largely sided with the ustaše
the ndh government immediately tried to strengthen their position by vilifying the serbs who according to tomasevich comprised around <num> per cent of the population
on <num> may a group of ten young ustaše students from the university of zagreb arrived in trebinje and began removing signs written in the cyrillic script used by serbs
on <num> june in several towns and villages in eastern herzegovina serbs were shot and businesses belonging to serb merchants and others were seized
on that day the ustaše students in trebinje shot nine serbs and arrested another fifteen apparently due to their links to the inter @-@ war chetnik association
differences began to appear between the brutal treatment of serbs by the ustaše and the more careful approach of the other ndh authorities such as the home guard who were aware of the potential danger created by ustaše methods
in early june the ndh authorities began operations to confiscate weapons from the population meeting with immediate resistance
on <num> june the residents of the village of donji drežanj near nevesinje refused to co @-@ operate with weapons collectors
in response the ustaše killed a number of serbs and burned their homes
on <num> june there were several incidents in which armed villagers spontaneously retaliated against the local authorities
that afternoon <num> ustaše were entering donji drežanj to confiscate firearms when they were attacked by a group of armed villagers
the villagers withdrew after a short firefight with one of their number being captured
reinforcements from the home guard and gendarmerie soon arrived along with more ustaše who burned another <num> houses and shot a woman
on the night of <num> <num> june a group under the control of the ustaše commissioner for the gacko district herman tonogal killed <num> serbs in the village of korita near bileća and threw their bodies into a nearby sinkhole
another <num> serbs from the village were killed between this massacre and <num> june and over <num> @,@ <num> head of livestock were stolen and distributed to muslim villages in the gacko area for the exclusive use of the ustaše
the estimated number of serbs killed at korita vary from <num> to <num>
in the immediate aftermath serbs and montenegrins from the local area attacked villages and adriatic command sent the <num> company of the <num> battalion from bileća to reinforce the ustaše
after a brief clash near korita during which the ustaše and gendarmerie lost one killed and several wounded the rebels withdrew across the nearby border into montenegro
the <num> company of the <num> battalion spent the night in the village of stepen before establishing itself as the avtovac garrison the following day
due to its exposure to fire from rebels overlooking their location the gendarmes were unable to re @-@ occupy their post in stepen which meant that the stepen – korita road was no longer secure
on <num> june the district office in gacko reported to adriatic command that they had taken <num> serbs as hostages and issued a proclamation to the population to cease fighting and surrender their weapons
as this proclamation met with no response on <num> june the ustaše commissioner for bosnia and herzegovina jure francetić had <num> hostages shot one escaped
on <num> june the gendarmerie in ravno shot four people on the orders of the ustaše commissioner for ljubinje
such actions led to serb peasants leaving their villages to seek safety in more remote areas and muslim villagers became increasingly nervous about their serb neighbours
in mid @-@ june the commander of the <num> company of the <num> battalion at bileća wrote to adriatic command complaining about the activities of the ustaše referring to them as armed scum and animals who were dishonouring honest croats
when the italians heard that the ustaše had burned two villages across the border in montenegro they sent an intelligence officer to gacko to investigate the unrest
he did not accept the explanation of the gendarmerie commander in gacko who claimed that the violence was caused by personal hatred and revenge and met with rebels
the rebels did not attack him or his security escort and told him that the reason behind the rebellion was that croats and turks are beating us and throwing us into a pit
he concluded that the cause of the unrest was the attempt to disarm the serb community
on <num> and <num> june tonogal and lieutenant colonel aganović gendarmerie commander for eastern herzegovina made an attempt to calm the situation by visiting villages east of the gacko – avtovac road to re @-@ establish peace in the area
they received a written message from four villages that they did not acknowledge the ndh authorities and wanted the message to be passed on to the italians
the residents of the villages of jasenik and lipnik were willing to talk and return to work but they asked that the gendarmerie not visit their villages as this would tempt the montenegrins to attack
aganović assessed that while this was probably true their request was insincere
the gendarmerie commander in bileća believed that the reason for the rebellion was that the local serbs were wedded to the idea of greater serbia and did not accept that their villages were part of the ndh
this approach essentially meant that local serbs wanted the ndh authorities to leave them alone and not impose on their lives
according to the historian davor marijan this was a poor choice that gave the ustaše an excuse to take radical action
the response of the ndh authorities to resistance had been to burn down the villages where this had occurred and there were mass shootings of serbs which escalated the level of violence even further
in late may and june <num> serbs had been rounded up tortured and killed in nevesinje and in early june another <num> serbs had been killed at ljubinje
in response serbs attacked ustaše officials and facilities and conducted raids themselves killing muslim villagers
this was barely adequate to guard important locations and was insufficient for offensive action
deployed forces consisted of one company of the <num> battalion in trebinje the headquarters and a reinforced company of the <num> battalion in bileća the balance of the battalion being divided between gacko and avtovac and a company of the <num> battalion in nevesinje
the remainder of the <num> battalion was deploying to trebinje at the time the rebellion broke out
after an extended firefight near the village of stepen <num> km <num>
<num> mi north of korita during which they suffered several casualties the ustaše also burned down four villages
they then entered two muslim @-@ majority villages in the area and arrested <num> serbs who had not been involved in the earlier fighting
the arrested serbs were transported north to avtovac and shot
that night all adult serbs above the age of <num> in gacko <num>
<num> km <num>
<num> mi northwest of avtovac were arrested and <num> were immediately shot
the rest were transported <num> km <num> mi west to a camp in nevesinje
over the period <num> – <num> june <num> serbs from the village of ravno <num> km <num> mi southwest of ljubinje were arrested and killed at the gendarmerie post and the remainder of the population fled to the hills
on <num> and <num> june spontaneous mass gatherings occurred at several villages in the gacko and nevesinje districts
these rallies were prompted by the news of the german invasion of the soviet union and those attending them voted to fight against the ustaše
professor marko attila hoare states that the full @-@ scale uprising resulted from the ustaše retaliation against attempts of the serbs of eastern herzegovina to defend themselves combined with the launching of the german invasion on <num> june
at dawn on <num> june the area of nevesinje descended into full @-@ scale revolt with around <num> armed rebels engaging the home guard garrison
by <num> june the uprising had reached a massive scale across eastern herzegovina with between <num> @,@ <num> and <num> @,@ <num> armed rebels in total including some montenegrins
about <num> <num> the town was attacked from the south and southwest
in response the home guard despatched two more companies of the <num> battalion from mostar to nevesinje
that morning reports also arrived from bileća and stolac that rebels were approaching the village of berkovići from the north and had captured the gendarmerie post at gornji lukavac
about <num> <num> the ustaše commissioner for stolac reported that <num> @,@ <num> montenegrins had gathered between nevesinje and stolac and he requested the immediate supply of <num> rifles for his men
a rebel attack on the gendarmerie post in the village of divin near bileća was repulsed around midday
a platoon of home guard reinforcements and weapons for the ustaše arrived at stolac in the afternoon and bileća was held throughout the day
reports of the uprising reached kvaternik during <num> june but he dismissed them and the reports of <num> @,@ <num> rebels cancelling adriatic command 's redeployment of the 21st battalion from slavonski brod as well as a request to the italians for air reconnaissance support
he stated that the suppression of the uprising could be handled by local forces
loss of communication with nevesinje resulted in rumours that the town had fallen to the rebels
the gendarmerie post at fojnica near gacko was captured on the afternoon of <num> june with the survivors escaping to gacko
newspapers reported rumours that gacko and avtovac had fallen to the rebels
having already despatched a reinforced company towards nevesinje from sarajevo earlier in the day adriatic command ordered the rest of the battalion to follow
the initial company group had already reached kalinovik some <num> kilometres <num> mi from nevesinje and the rest of the battalion was expected to spend the night of <num> <num> june there before arriving in nevesinje around noon on <num> june
kvaternik received an updated report on the situation in eastern herzegovina during the night and prpić travelled from sarajevo to mostar to take control of operations to find that information about the situation in eastern herzegovina was unclear but suggested that ndh forces could be facing serious difficulties
with the assistance of ustaše the home guard were able to hold their ground but they were unable to break through to nevesinje
that afternoon two aircraft of the air force of the independent state of croatia croatian zrakoplovstvo nezavisne države hrvatske zndh from sarajevo conducted an armed reconnaissance over eastern herzegovina and discovered that ndh forces still held nevesinje
they observed barricades across the mostar – nevesinje road and strafed a group of <num> rebels north of nevesinje near the village of kifino selo
prpić bolstered the force on the mostar – nevesinje road with the <num> battalion recently arrived from sarajevo and sent his deputy colonel antun prohaska to command it
the <num> battalion joined that force at <num> <num>
about <num> <num> the company of the <num> battalion reached nevesinje from kalinovik and a further company of the battalion was despatched from sarajevo along with the battalion commander
in the southern part of the area of operations around stolac the situation was significantly calmer than around nevesinje although a group of <num> ustaše at berkovići were falsely claiming that they were being surrounded by rebels at night
despite this claim they had suffered no casualties
regardless prpić sent them ammunition and a platoon of the <num> battalion
at <num> <num> on <num> june francetić arrived at prpić 's headquarters in mostar to be briefed on the situation
he resolved that he would travel to berkovići the following day and take personal command of the ustaše unit there
around gacko and avtovac in the north the day had been quiet
when the commander of the <num> company of the <num> battalion at gacko reported rebels gathering near the town prpić sent a truck @-@ mounted platoon with an ammunition resupply
the platoon was ambushed en route with <num> home guardsmen being captured
gacko was reinforced later in the day from troops in avtovac
on the night of <num> june the nevesinje garrison was subjected to a sustained attack by the rebels but held out
the ndh authorities in trebinje heard rumours that the serbs could start an uprising there on <num> june the feast day of saint vitus and warned ndh forces in the region to be prepared for a revolt
as a result of these reports the poglavnik leader of the ndh ante pavelić issued orders threatening that anyone who spread these rumours would be court @-@ martialled
on the eve of the feast day both the gendarmerie and ustaše took several hostages in case the rumours were true
later the gendarmerie released their hostages but the <num> hostages held by the ustaše were killed
in contrast to the actions of the ustaše the home guard units in the area tried to calm the situation down
prohaska commanded the push east along the mostar – nevesinje road by a force close to two battalions francetić led his unit of ustaše north from berkovići through the mountains via odžak to approach nevesinje from the south and two companies of the <num> battalion thrust southwest along the road from plužine
once this task was complete the ndh forces were to vigorously pursue the rebels and destroy them
the prohaska group deployed with one company on the road and elements of the <num> battalion and <num> ustaše on the left flank
their attack commenced about <num> <num> and although they faced strong resistance from the rebels aided by strafing and bombing by zndh aircraft they reached villages on the outskirts of nevesinje after fighting that lasted until dawn on <num> june
one home guard battalion halted and took up a defensive stance and the commander was threatened with dismissal by prpić before he resumed the attack
francetić 's ustaše unit also faced heavy fighting and had to call for ammunition resupply on two occasions
one of the resupply vehicles was ambushed by rebels between stolac and berkovići and some ammunition was finally delivered by passenger car during the night
elsewhere rebels attacked gacko and avtovac and one zndh aircraft was shot down by rebel machine gun fire near avtovac
that night prpić telephoned kvaternik and advised him that the imposition of martial law was necessary to restore order to herzegovina
army chief of staff general vladimir laxa was immediately appointed by pavelić to control both hum and dubrava counties which incorporated much of eastern herzegovina
on <num> june laxa became the overall commander of all ndh authorities in hum and dubrava counties which included ustaše home guard civil administration gendarmerie and police
military courts were established to deal with those resisting the ndh authorities
armed guards were posted at the entrance to towns and villages and any armed civilians were to be disarmed and brought to military authorities
laxa issued an order that gave the rebels until <num> july to submit to the authorities
on that day after the prohaska group broke through to nevesinje from mostar prohaska sent a company of the <num> battalion to kifino selo to meet the two companies of the <num> battalion advancing from plužine
despite zndh air support the company of the <num> battalion was attacked by rebels near the entrance to kifino selo and the majority broke and ran
prohaska had to send reserves to block the road between nevesinje and kifino selo and the companies from the <num> battalion began to reconnoitre the rebel positions towards odžak
also on that morning the <num> home guard troops and about <num> armed locals in avtovac were attacked from three directions by rebels
they recovered from their initial surprise and held the town during the day but in the evening a renewed assault caused them to withdraw from avtovac and retreat to the villages of međuljići and ključ
upon capturing avtovac the rebels looted the village burned down a large number of muslim homes and killed <num> muslim civilians mostly women children and the elderly
gacko was also attacked by the rebels with eight soldiers killed and one officer and <num> soldiers wounded
also on <num> june two italian army trucks driving from bileća to avtovac were ambushed by rebels who killed three soldiers and wounded <num>
around <num> <num> the italian command advised kvaternik that they would be clearing the route from bileća via gacko to nevesinje on an unspecified future date
during the fighting around gacko several zndh aircraft were forced to land due to pilot casualties and engine trouble
zndh air support operations were suspended due to lack of fuel and spares for the aircraft
there was no improvement in the situation around stolac and an ustaše unit made up of armed civilians proved to be of such low combat value that laxa spoke to francetić and criticised its performance
south of bileća rebels destroyed the gendarmerie post in a village killing seven gendarmes
dozens of gendarmes were sent from trebinje to assist them but they were stopped by rebels and withdrew into a village schoolhouse
in the afternoon a platoon of the <num> home guard battalion was sent north from trebinje to support the gendarmes but they were attacked near the village of mosko and withdrew into a defensive position
they were reinforced by a second platoon during the night and were given orders to clear the road from trebinje to bileća on the following morning ahead of the italians
prohaska demanded help from mostar and planned to send a force from nevesinje to assist
from mostar a company of the 21st battalion was despatched to relieve the ustaše who had managed to hold off the rebels
the home guard company then took over the post from the ustaše
the same day two new battalions arrived in mostar the <num> battalion from osijek and the <num> battalion from travnik
these reinforcements arrived just as prpić received confirmation that avtovac had been captured by the rebels
the remaining small garrison in gacko consisting of only <num> gendarmes and <num> ustaše were holding out but expecting more attacks by the rebels
in the morning the attack by elements of the <num> battalion stalled until the battalion commander lieutenant colonel julije reš personally took command of the operation clearing the way for the italians
the promised italian intervention commenced about midday and about <num> trucks of italian soldiers arrived in gacko about <num> <num>
as they had passed through avtovac the rebels had left the town and withdrawn to villages to the east
about <num> <num> the <num> battalion relieved the besieged gendarmes in the village schoolhouse
zndh aircraft from mostar airfield flew reconnaissance sorties over the area and dropped leaflets over stolac stepen avtovac gacko and plužine
after the garrison of nevesinje had been relieved laxa directed his main effort towards the gacko and avtovac districts
sensitive to the fact that the italians had not respected the territorial borders of the ndh when they sent their column to gacko he considered it very important that croatian military and political prestige be restored otherwise the italians might decide to remain in the area rather than withdraw to their garrison near the adriatic coast
he planned to follow this consolidation by clearing the border areas with montenegro then clearing the hinterland of any remaining rebels
for this last task he intended to deploy a yet @-@ to @-@ be @-@ formed special unit to be led by lieutenant colonel josip metzger
the task of re @-@ asserting ndh authority in the gacko and avtovac districts was allocated to prohaska 's group consisting of the <num> battalion one company of the <num> battalion two companies of the <num> battalion and the recently arrived <num> and 21st battalions which were to be sent to nevesinje from mostar
prohaska was to act in concert with the <num> battalion who were already in the vicinity of plužine just to the north of the nevesinje – gacko road
in preparation the <num> battalion was trucked to nevesinje and a company of the <num> battalion conducted a coordinated attack with the <num> battalion on rebel positions near kifino selo
this attack was defeated by the rebels and a battalion commander was killed
during the remainder of the day the italians collected the bodies of their dead from the rebel ambush on <num> june and rescued some home guard troops that had escaped avtovac but then returned to plana just north of bileća
the value of further operations in the gacko and avtovac areas was brought into question when the italians reported that both towns had been burned to the ground and all the inhabitants had been massacred
the italians blamed montenegrins attached to the rebels for the destruction and killings in the two towns
the italian estimate of rebel strength was around <num> @,@ <num> armed with machine guns artillery and anti @-@ aircraft guns
a german intelligence officer from sarajevo arrived at prpić 's headquarters in mostar to receive a briefing on the situation
the small garrison of gacko was anticipating an attack by rebels during the night but in the afternoon <num> home guardsmen that had withdrawn from avtovac arrived to bolster their position and the night passed without incident
an ustaše operation to clear the insurgents from the stolac district began on <num> july meeting with success and opening of the road from berkovci north to odžak
the ustaše did not go closer to nevesinje as they were not in uniform and were concerned that the home guards would mistake them for rebels
during this operation three ustaše were killed including their commander and the ustaše fighters killed ten rebels and captured two
in the belongings of one of the captured rebels the ustaše located a report by the national movement for the liberation of nevesinje serbo @-@ croatian narodni pokret za oslobođenje nevesinja which was apparently how the rebels referred to themselves
the report made it clear that the rebels were using military tactics and organisation and hinted at co @-@ operation with the italians
according to information gathered by the police the local rebel leadership included former mostar merchant čedo milić the bjelogrlić brothers from avtovac the orthodox priest father mastilović from nadinići and a captain radović from avtovac
montenegrins involved in the leadership of the uprising included colonel bajo stanišić major minja višnjić and radojica nikčević from nikšić
following the italian intervention prpić was able to proceed with the task of clearing the wider area of nevesinje from <num> july ensuring ndh control of population centres and roads
on <num> july he replaced his deputy prohaska with colonel franjo šimić and assigned him a force consisting of the <num> <num> <num> and <num> battalions a company of the <num> battalion and a troop of artillery
the force numbered <num> officers and <num> @,@ <num> men with heavy weapons including four <num> mm skoda houfnice vz <num> mountain howitzers six heavy machine guns and twenty @-@ seven light machine guns
šimić seized the crossroads near kifino selo and plužine securing it with one company of the <num> battalion then sent the <num> battalion to gacko and the <num> battalion to berkovići
a half company of the 21st battalion secured the mostar – nevesinje road
once this was completed the major roads in eastern herzegovina were secured
these operations proceeded without significant fighting as some of the rebels retreated over the border with montenegro and others hid their weapons in the mountains and returned to their homes
by <num> july ndh forces had regained full control over all the towns and transport routes in eastern herzegovina
he contends that the uprising was the result of several factors including the ustaše persecutions fear and hatred of the ndh authorities a local tradition of rebellion against the ottoman empire the poor economic conditions in eastern herzegovina and news of the launching of operation barbarossa against the soviet union
hoare concurs with tomasevich that the uprising was in the tradition of the herzegovinian rebellions against the ottoman empire during the <num> century such as the uprisings in <year> – <num>
edmund glaise @-@ horstenau the german plenipotentiary general in the ndh believed that the italians might have deliberately avoided interfering in the uprising
general renzo dalmazzo the commander of the italian <num> army corps blamed the ustaše and muslims for stoking the revolt
in eastern herzegovina the kpj had little impact until mid @-@ august <year> well after the initial revolt had been suppressed
during the lead @-@ up to the mass uprising the kpj organisation in herzegovina would not commit itself as it was waiting for orders from the provincial organisation in sarajevo which was expecting direction from the kpj central committee to launch a general uprising across yugoslavia
once they became aware of the german attack on the soviet union the kpj in herzegovina voted to join the mass uprising but this only occurred on <num> june when the uprising was already in full swing
according to milazzo the rebels remained a threat throughout eastern herzegovina well into july although the uprising in herzegovina did not advance until the bosnia @-@ wide revolt occurred at the end of july by which time the kpj was ready for active involvement in the fighting

danny starts spilling the beans to reubens about his city life moving into his first apartment and his suffering job as a chef because the ladies love a man who can cook
he heavily depends on reubens for some serious help if he wants to get rid of his insomnia

projects the image of a bucket and shovel at the beach onto the helmet he recalls his love life some few years ago with a girl named tina ash who reubens mistakenly thought was danny 's mother
returning the next summer danny is jilted for a more handsome man
devastated danny ends up sitting on the pier crying inadvertently falling into the ocean below but eventually rescued
reubens claims danny 's rejection made him shy away from the fairer sex and tells him to get some rest
the next day dr
reubens tunes up his machine to match danny 's abnormally low cognitive frequency
danny recommends he give them some time alone but the word alone has reubens allude to the time danny was heavily abused as a young boy at a local funfair by three thugs however danny discloses that he ditched his parents to go to the funfair alone but they find and rescue him
he then promised his parents that he 'd stay with them forever
dr
reubens uses this evidence to come to a conclusion that homesickness is the cause of his insomnia recommending that danny moves back into his parents house but his conclusion is proved wrong when danny returns one more time
dr
reubens lashes out at danny for wearing out his machine demanding that danny fess up to where he buried his pain and if he is merely toying with them
pushing the limit reubens subjects danny to regress all the way to his childhood when he was only six years old against danny 's own will
danny cries at the breaking point dictating that reubens stop unlocking doors that should stay bolted but in the end danny mutters the words come back implying that his parents went out on a date and left him at his house alone with disturbing shadows of the night leaving danny in psychological trauma
danny discovers that his childhood fears at that time principally being afraid of the dark are the real cause his insomnia sending him spiraling back into his six @-@ year @-@ old self

smiles and laughs into the camera she winks and the screen cuts to black
the levels represent danny 's mind a dark city landscape with many tall buildings and the occasional street lamp a hotel resting aside a seaside location a dark and mysterious funfair and a haunted childhood bedroom
levels are mostly composed of platforms formed by blocks
the player 's goal in each level is to collect marbles which give the player points based on their color
the exit from the level is opened once a predetermined number of points have been collected
danny can crawl into narrow areas and jump a small height
the main gameplay feature of crush is the ability to transpose the layout of a level between 2d and 3d representations to reach seemingly inaccessible areas and solve the game 's puzzles
the player can switch the third @-@ person camera between four directional side views and a top @-@ down view at any time while in 3d
when in these views the player can have danny crush the level collapsing all 3d elements into 2d crushing from side views results in a 2d platformer @-@ like view while crushing from the top @-@ down view provides a 2d top @-@ down perspective
crushing can connect and merge platforms on the same visual plane in the 3d view but separated by a large distance creating pathways across the level in the 2d view
the player can also uncrush the level at any time
certain blocks when crushed become either obstacles through which danny cannot pass or ledges the player can use to reach other parts of the level
attempts to crush a level in any manner that would harm danny are thwarted
however uncrushing can leave danny in a helpless state such as hanging in mid @-@ air
enemy monsters inhabit the levels but the player can crush them by flattening impassable blocks against them
the player may also encounter timers in the form of alarm clocks that will begin to elapse when crushed for the first time and can only be stopped when danny jumps on them
danny wakes from his mental explorations if he falls off the level or too high of a surface is touched by a monster or fails to stop a timer but the c
r
u
s
h
device reinserts him at the start of the level or the last checkpoint danny passed
throughout the levels are scattered large spheres and cylinders which the player can roll when crushed appropriately
these can then be used as platforms or to depress switches
jigsaw pieces can be collected to reveal concept art and extras in the game 's menus
some of danny 's thoughts represented by glowing neon icons on the walls of the level are only activated when the level is crushed in a manner that does not obscure them
some thoughts allow danny to jump higher or stop time
once the player completes each level they are graded by the duration of danny 's stay on the level how many times danny woke up and a bonus for collecting all marbles the jigsaw piece and a hidden thought trophy
the thought trophy once completed by crushing unlocks a level 's special challenge mode for later play which requires time @-@ limited completion of the level with an allotted number of crushes
the initial concept was built on the crushing mechanism between 2d and 3d and they only had to create appropriate obstacles to prevent players from simply crushing across the level
mottram noted that during the development of crush the gameplay of super paper mario had not yet been revealed and thus the team was surprised to learn that it shared a similar feature
mottram stated that the crushing mechanism had been developed and refined for six months before developing the story and characters the development team wanted to have a normal person in an impossible situation
the art and level design were inspired by tim burton mike mignola and m
c
escher
the plot was originally more morbid than in the final product with danny dying and the rest of the game told as flashbacks
the game levels were developed on a level editor on the playstation portable but zoë mode were not able to refine the editor in time for shipping
mottram said it would be great to see user generated content and this is something we have been seriously thinking about for the future and that downloadable content would work perfectly with the crush level structure and i am sure that fans of the game would be eager to see more levels
mottram has stated they would like to market a sequel based on the highly positive feedback they had received however with other zoë mode projects such as singstar and play taking precedence he does not know when this could be
the game was highly praised for its innovative approach to gameplay
ryan davis of gamespot appreciated crush for owing very little of its novel concept to games that preceded it
nick suttner of 1up called the game a cognitively rewarding expertly designed puzzle experience that truly plays like nothing else
reviews were mixed on the game 's learning curve
ign 's jeremy dunham praised the ordering of the puzzle elements that new gaming elements are introduced at an ideal pace and that most puzzles have solutions where the player must think outside the box
eurogamer 's dan whitehead commented that the game introduces these elements too quickly and doesn 't give you much time to put the basics into practice
some critics found that elements of the game detracted from the game 's uniqueness
x @-@ play 's greg orlando while stating that this was one of the most novel games ever made noted that it was simply not very fun as it lacked many player incentives beyond manipulating the world and collecting objects on each level
reviewers noted that some puzzles were awkward due to the selection of the playstation portable 's controls
reviewers found the game 's story poor but this was overcome by the gameplay elements charles harold of the new york times said the minimal story is as forgettable as its puzzles are ingenious
gamesradar included it in their list of the <num> most overlooked games of its generation
editor jason fanelli stated that the ability to switch from 2d to 3d was one of the most unique at the time features we ’ ve ever seen
ign awarded crush psp game of the month for may <year>
gamespy called crush the third best playstation portable game and the psp puzzle game of the year for its game of the year <year> awards
similarly ign awarded crush the best psp puzzle game most innovative psp game and best psp game no one played awards in their game of the year <year> selections
crush won the <year> develop conference industry award for best new handheld ip
according to paul mottram positive reception of the game did not translate into high sales but the game will hopefully stick around for a while and continue to shift units
it won the <year> aria music award for highest selling album best group and best rock album
the album was the band 's shortest yet focusing on social political and emotional issues that had appeared in prior works especially internationalist
the album produced four singles
the most successful my happiness reached <num> on the aria singles chart won the <year> aria music award for single of the year and topped triple j 's hottest <num> in <year>
the album also featured these days which topped triple j 's hottest <num> in <year>
the album was also ranked at number <num> in triple j 's hottest <num> australian albums of all time poll in <year>
many critics lauded the album as powderfinger 's best work one stated that the album was the finger 's crowning glory however others were critical of the imitation contained in the album
overall the album won five aria music awards in <year> and was certified platinum seven times and earned an eighth in <year>
odyssey number five was powderfinger 's first album to chart in the united states and the band toured extensively around north america to promote its release
fanning said his lyrics were based on the obstacles in the way of being in a relationship especially in our work situation
powderfinger worked with producer nick didia on odyssey number five as they had done on internationalist finishing the album in august <year> after six weeks of recording
the band spent this time ensuring higher quality songs than on internationalist which had featured out @-@ of @-@ tune guitars on passenger
odyssey number five was powderfinger 's shortest album when recorded running for approximately <num> minutes
the focus of the album was on restraint with more simplistic lyrics than previously and with a plain and simple message intended
fanning said of his songwriting ethic you try and make it something that ’ s got some substance but also you can never do that at the cost of it having relevance to what you ’ re singing
powderfinger manager paul piticco commented that their ethos is to be pushing the limits of their songwriting ability
like powderfinger 's previous album internationalist odyssey number five commented on social and political issues heavily with the primary point of focus being aboriginal affairs
the lyrics of like a dog attacked former prime minister of australia john howard 's liberal government for its treatment of indigenous australians and for breaking the relaxed and comfortable promise he made in the australian federal election <year>
lead singer bernard fanning related this to the band 's other ethical stances — refusing to appear on hey hey it 's saturday for its anti @-@ gay commentary or not allowing powderfinger songs to be used in jingles amongst others — stating we 're not here to set an example
we just want to be happy with ourselves and not end up with a guilty conscience
fanning said that despite like a dog being about a political issue it was not a political song rather just powderfinger voicing our opinions
the band worked with boxer anthony mundine on the song 's music video whom fanning praised as the perfect lead in terms of what the song is about and the fact that he ’ s prepared to speak up for what he believes in
as well as providing social commentary odyssey number five also discussed love a recurring motif in fanning 's songwriting
fanning noted that one of the causes of this was his passion for soul and gospel music stating that he listen s to a lot of soul music that 's unashamedly about love and how good it makes you feel
lead guitarist ian haug agreed and also noted that the band as a whole were fully committed to fanning 's lyrics stating it 's really important for us to agree with what bernard is singing
odyssey number five marked powderfinger 's first successful attempt to enter the united states market
fanning told billboard in a <year> interview that the band were not taking anything for granted however stating in america we haven 't really done any work yet to deserve any major popularity with the vibes on previous albums failing to reach the american mainstream
powderfinger toured extensively around the country performing in <num> cities
as a result of these efforts my happiness was briefly placed on rotation on kroq @-@ fm and several other radio stations
the song ultimately peaked at <num> on the modern rock tracks chart
this success was assisted by the band appearing on the late show with david letterman and by supporting coldplay on tour
guitarist darren middleton summarised their work in the united states by stating this year has been a bit of a blur
the album was released in the united kingdom on polydor with <num> minutes of video and an additional track nature boy at a later date
a sampler version was released in the united states in <year> containing five tracks
four singles were released from the album
my kind of scene was the first released as a promotional single in june <year>
the track was written for the <year> film mission impossible ii and appeared on its soundtrack
collins and middleton recalled that the song was written and produced with photos of tom cruise and nicole kidman on the wall of the band 's studio as inspiration
they noted that the band made three songs in response to the mission impossible ii request and that my kind of scene was chosen over up down back again and whatever makes you happy
the second single from the album was my happiness released on <num> august <year> in australia
my happiness entered the aria singles chart at <num> and spent <num> weeks on the chart making it powderfinger 's highest charting single in australia
it peaked at <num> on the new zealand singles chart and spent <num> weeks in the top <num>
furthermore my happiness was powderfinger 's first single to chart in the usa reaching <num> on the modern rock tracks chart
like a dog was released as the third single on <num> january <year>
the song was heavy in political sentiment akin to the day you come on internationalist
the riff for the song was written by ian haug and the song 's music video featured australian aboriginal boxer anthony mundine and was based on the <year> martin scorsese film raging bull
drummer jon coghill said the song revolved around the question of why the hell won ’ t john howard say sorry to the aboriginal people like a dog spent one week on the aria singles chart at <num>
two songs from the album the metre and waiting for the sun were released as a double a @-@ side to form the final single
the single was released on <num> august <year> and included a cover of iron maiden 's number of the beast
waiting for the sun was written by fanning as a devotional gospel style song
he said of the song it ’ s about being in a relationship and being really heavily happy with it
the metre spent one week on the aria singles chart at <num>
entertainment weekly reviewer marc weingarten gave the album a b
he stated that album entered new terrain in guitar rock complimenting the scratching and clawing guitars drawing comparisons to travis prim and oasis mock @-@ grandiose
allmusic reviewer dean carlson disliked the album giving it a rating of one and a half stars
he described it as little more than a slightly off @-@ base perspective into the world of mid @-@ <num> american grunge and described it as highly similar to neil young
carlson 's only praise was for songs odyssey <num> and my happiness stating that t oo often powderfinger is too earnest a bit too careful in their career
carlson noted that despite his critique the album achieved some success in the american market
devon powers of popmatters complimented fanning 's vocals and said the focus of the album was meaty rolling ballads
powers said that many of the songs on the album were the kind of songs you put on repeat for hours or days
the main critique was for the faster numbers stating that like a dog sounds mostly a little bored
the review concluded by noting that the best songs on odyssey were those not available as fleeting radio singles and background music
odyssey number five won the <year> aria awards for album of the year highest selling album best rock album best cover art and best group
my happiness won the award for single of the year while like a dog was nominated for highest selling single and best video
at the <year> aria awards the metre was nominated for best group
the album was named album of the year by rolling stone australia readers with my happiness taking out song of the year and powderfinger receiving band of the year
native throughout the temperate and boreal regions of the northern hemisphere amanita muscaria has been unintentionally introduced to many countries in the southern hemisphere generally as a symbiont with pine and birch plantations and is now a true cosmopolitan species
it associates with various deciduous and coniferous trees
this iconic toadstool is a large white @-@ gilled white @-@ spotted usually red mushroom and is one of the most recognisable and widely encountered in popular culture
several subspecies with differing cap colour have been recognised including the brown regalis often considered a separate species the yellow @-@ orange flavivolvata guessowii formosa and the pinkish persicina
genetic studies published in <year> and <year> show several sharply delineated clades that may represent separate species
although classified as poisonous reports of human deaths resulting from its ingestion are extremely rare
after parboiling — which weakens its toxicity and breaks down the mushroom 's psychoactive substances — it is eaten in parts of europe asia and north america
amanita muscaria is noted for its hallucinogenic properties with its main psychoactive constituent being the compound muscimol
the mushroom was used as an intoxicant and entheogen by the peoples of siberia and has a religious significance in these cultures
there has been much speculation on possible traditional use of this mushroom as an intoxicant in other places such as the middle east eurasia north america and scandinavia
this practice has been recorded from germanic- and slavic @-@ speaking parts of europe as well as the vosges region and pockets elsewhere in france and romania
albertus magnus was the first to record it in his work de vegetabilibus some time before <num> commenting vocatur fungus muscarum eo quod in lacte pulverizatus interficit muscas it is called the fly mushroom because it is powdered in milk to kill flies
the <num> @-@ century flemish botanist carolus clusius traced the practice of sprinkling it into milk to frankfurt in germany while carl linnaeus the father of taxonomy reported it from småland in southern sweden where he had lived as a child
he described it in volume two of his species plantarum in <year> giving it the name agaricus muscarius the specific epithet deriving from latin musca meaning fly
it gained its current name in <year> when placed in the genus amanita by jean @-@ baptiste lamarck a name sanctioned in <year> by the father of mycology swedish naturalist elias magnus fries
the starting date for all the mycota had been set by general agreement as january <num> <year> the date of fries 's work and so the full name was then amanita muscaria l
fr
hook
the <year> edition of the international code of botanical nomenclature changed the rules on the starting date and primary work for names of fungi and names can now be considered valid as far back as may <num> <year> the date of publication of linnaeus 's work
hence linnaeus and lamarck are now taken as the namers of amanita muscaria l
lam
the english mycologist john ramsbottom reported that amanita muscaria was used for getting rid of bugs in england and sweden and bug agaric was an old alternate name for the species
french mycologist pierre bulliard reported having tried without success to replicate its fly @-@ killing properties in his work histoire des plantes vénéneuses et suspectes de la france <year> and proposed a new binomial name agaricus pseudo @-@ aurantiacus because of this
one compound isolated from the fungus is <num> @,@ <num> @-@ diolein <num> @,@ <num> @-@ di cis @-@ <num> @-@ octadecenoyl glycerol which attracts insects
it has been hypothesised that the flies intentionally seek out the fly agaric for its intoxicating properties
an alternative derivation proposes that the term fly- refers not to insects as such but rather the delirium resulting from consumption of the fungus
this is based on the medieval belief that flies could enter a person 's head and cause mental illness
several regional names appear to be linked with this connotation meaning the mad or fool 's version of the highly regarded edible mushroom amanita caesarea
hence there is oriol foll mad oriol in catalan mujolo folo from toulouse concourlo fouolo from the aveyron department in southern france ovolo matto from trentino in italy
a local dialect name in fribourg in switzerland is tsapi de diablhou which translates as devil 's hat
by extension it is also the type species of amanita subgenus amanita as well as section amanita within this subgenus
amanita subgenus amanita includes all amanita with inamyloid spores
amanita section amanita includes the species which have very patchy universal veil remnants including a volva that is reduced to a series of concentric rings and the veil remnants on the cap to a series of patches or warts
most species in this group also have a bulbous base
amanita section amanita consists of a
muscaria and its close relatives including a
pantherina the panther cap a
gemmata a
farinosa and a
xanthocephala
modern fungal taxonomists have classified amanita muscaria and its allies this way based on gross morphology and spore inamyloidy
two recent molecular phylogenetic studies have confirmed this classification as natural
amanita muscaria varies considerably in its morphology and many authorities recognise several subspecies or varieties within the species
in the agaricales in modern taxonomy german mycologist rolf singer listed three subspecies though without description a
muscaria ssp
muscaria a
muscaria ssp
americana and a
muscaria ssp
flavivolvata
contemporary authorities recognise up to seven varieties a <year> molecular phylogenetic study of different regional populations of a
muscaria by mycologist józsef geml and colleagues found three distinct clades within this species representing roughly eurasian eurasian subalpine and north american populations
specimens belonging to all three clades have been found in alaska this has led to the hypothesis that this was the centre of diversification for this species
the study also looked at four named varieties of the species var
alba var
flavivolvata var
formosa including var
guessowii and var
regalis from both areas
all four varieties were found within both the eurasian and north american clades evidence that these morphological forms are polymorphisms rather than distinct subspecies or varieties
further molecular study by geml and colleagues published in <year> show that these three genetic groups plus a fourth associated with oak – hickory – pine forest in the southeastern united states and two more on santa cruz island in california are delineated from each other enough genetically to be considered separate species thus a
muscaria as it stands currently is evidently a species complex
the complex also includes at least three other closely related taxa that are currently regarded as species a
breckonii is a buff @-@ capped mushroom associated with conifers from the pacific northwest and the brown @-@ capped a
gioiosa and a
heterochroma from the mediterranean basin and from sardinia respectively
both of these last two are found with eucalyptus and cistus trees and it is unclear whether they are native or introduced from australia
fly agaric fruiting bodies emerge from the soil looking like white eggs
after emerging from the ground the cap is covered with numerous small white to yellow pyramid @-@ shaped warts
these are remnants of the universal veil a membrane that encloses the entire mushroom when it is still very young
dissecting the mushroom at this stage will reveal a characteristic yellowish layer of skin under the veil this is helpful in identification
as the fungus grows the red colour appears through the broken veil and the warts become less prominent they do not change in size but are reduced relative to the expanding skin area
the cap changes from globose to hemispherical and finally to plate @-@ like and flat in mature specimens
fully grown the bright red cap is usually around <num> – <num> cm <num> – <num> in in diameter although larger specimens have been found
the red colour may fade after rain and in older mushrooms
the free gills are white as is the spore print
the oval spores measure <num> – <num> by <num>
<num> – <num> μm they do not turn blue with the application of iodine
the stipe is white <num> – <num> cm high <num> – <num> in by <num> – <num> cm <num>
<num> – <num>
<num> in wide and has the slightly brittle fibrous texture typical of many large mushrooms
at the base is a bulb that bears universal veil remnants in the form of two to four distinct rings or ruffs
between the basal universal veil remnants and gills are remnants of the partial veil which covers the gills during development in the form of a white ring
it can be quite wide and flaccid with age
there is generally no associated smell other than a mild earthiness
although very distinctive in appearance the fly agaric has been mistaken for other yellow to red mushroom species in the americas such as armillaria cf
mellea and the edible amanita basii — a mexican species similar to a
caesarea of europe
poison control centres in the u
s
and canada have become aware that amarill spanish for yellow is a common name for the a
caesarea @-@ like species in mexico
amanita caesarea can be distinguished by its entirely orange to red cap which lacks the numerous white warty spots of the fly agaric
furthermore the stem gills and ring of a
caesarea are bright yellow not white
the volva is a distinct white bag not broken into scales
in australia the introduced fly agaric may be confused with the native vermilion grisette amanita xanthocephala which grows in association with eucalypts
the latter species generally lacks the white warts of a
muscaria and bears no ring
a recent molecular study proposes that it had an ancestral origin in the siberian – beringian region in the tertiary period before radiating outwards across asia europe and north america
the season for fruiting varies in different climates fruiting occurs in summer and autumn across most of north america but later in autumn and early winter on the pacific coast
this species is often found in similar locations to boletus edulis and may appear in fairy rings
conveyed with pine seedlings it has been widely transported into the southern hemisphere including australia new zealand south africa and south america where it can be found in the southern brazilian states of paraná and rio grande do sul
ectomycorrhizal amanita muscaria forms symbiotic relationships with many trees including pine spruce fir birch and cedar
commonly seen under introduced trees a
muscaria is the fungal equivalent of a weed in new zealand tasmania and victoria forming new associations with southern beech nothofagus
the species is also invading a rainforest in australia where it may be displacing the native species
it appears to be spreading northwards with recent reports placing it near port macquarie on the new south wales north coast
it was recorded under silver birch betula pendula in manjimup western australia in <year>
although it has apparently not spread to eucalypts in australia it has been recorded associating with them in portugal
occasionally it has been ingested in error because immature button forms resemble puffballs
the white spots sometimes wash away during heavy rain and the mushrooms then may appear to be the edible a
caesarea
amanita muscaria contains several biologically active agents at least one of which muscimol is known to be psychoactive
ibotenic acid a neurotoxin serves as a prodrug to muscimol with approximately <num> – <num> converting to muscimol after ingestion
an active dose in adults is approximately <num> mg muscimol or <num> to <num> mg ibotenic acid this is typically about the amount found in one cap of amanita muscaria
the amount and ratio of chemical compounds per mushroom varies widely from region to region and season to season which can further confuse the issue
spring and summer mushrooms have been reported to contain up to <num> times more ibotenic acid and muscimol than autumn fruitings
a fatal dose has been calculated as <num> caps
deaths from this fungus a
muscaria have been reported in historical journal articles and newspaper reports but with modern medical treatment fatal poisoning from ingesting this mushroom is extremely rare
many older books list amanita muscaria as deadly but this is an error that implies the mushroom is more toxic than it is
the north american mycological association has stated there were no reliably documented fatalities from eating this mushroom during the <num> century
the vast majority <num> or more of mushroom poisoning deaths are from eating the greenish to yellowish death cap a
phalloides or perhaps even one of the several white amanita species which are known as destroying angels
the active constituents of this species are water @-@ soluble and boiling and then discarding the cooking water at least partly detoxifies a
muscaria
drying may increase potency as the process facilitates the conversion of ibotenic acid to the more potent muscimol
according to some sources once detoxified the mushroom becomes edible
muscaria
muscarine binds with muscarinic acetylcholine receptors leading to the excitation of neurons bearing these receptors
the levels of muscarine in amanita muscaria are minute when compared with other poisonous fungi such as inocybe erubescens the small white clitocybe species c
dealbata and c
rivulosa
the level of muscarine in a
muscaria is too low to play a role in the symptoms of poisoning
the major toxins involved in a
muscaria poisoning are muscimol <num> @-@ hydroxy @-@ <num> @-@ aminomethyl @-@ <num> @-@ isoxazole an unsaturated cyclic hydroxamic acid and the related amino acid ibotenic acid
muscimol is the product of the decarboxylation usually by drying of ibotenic acid
muscimol and ibotenic acid were discovered in the mid @-@ <num> century
researchers in england japan and switzerland showed that the effects produced were due mainly to ibotenic acid and muscimol not muscarine
these toxins are not distributed uniformly in the mushroom
most are detected in the cap of the fruit a moderate amount in the base with the smallest amount in the stalk
quite rapidly between <num> and <num> minutes after ingestion a substantial fraction of ibotenic acid is excreted unmetabolised in the urine of the consumer
almost no muscimol is excreted when pure ibotenic acid is eaten but muscimol is detectable in the urine after eating a
muscaria which contains both ibotenic acid and muscimol
ibotenic acid and muscimol are structurally related to each other and to two major neurotransmitters of the central nervous system glutamic acid and gaba respectively
ibotenic acid and muscimol act like these neurotransmitters muscimol being a potent gabaa agonist while ibotenic acid is an agonist of nmda glutamate receptors and certain metabotropic glutamate receptors which are involved in the control of neuronal activity
it is these interactions which are thought to cause the psychoactive effects found in intoxication
muscimol is the agent responsible for the majority of the psychoactivity
muscazone is another compound that has more recently been isolated from european specimens of the fly agaric
it is a product of the breakdown of ibotenic acid by ultra @-@ violet radiation
muscazone is of minor pharmacological activity compared with the other agents
amanita muscaria and related species are known as effective bioaccumulators of vanadium some species concentrate vanadium to levels of up to <num> times those typically found in plants
vanadium is present in fruit @-@ bodies as an organometallic compound called amavadine
the biological importance of the accumulation process is unknown
depending on habitat and the amount ingested per body weight effects can range from nausea and twitching to drowsiness cholinergic crisis @-@ like effects low blood pressure sweating and salivation auditory and visual distortions mood changes euphoria relaxation ataxia and loss of equilibrium
in cases of serious poisoning the mushroom causes delirium somewhat similar in effect to anticholinergic poisoning such as that caused by datura stramonium characterised by bouts of marked agitation with confusion hallucinations and irritability followed by periods of central nervous system depression
seizures and coma may also occur in severe poisonings
symptoms typically appear after around <num> to <num> minutes and peak within three hours but certain effects can last for several days
in the majority of cases recovery is complete within <num> to <num> hours
the effect is highly variable between individuals with similar doses potentially causing quite different reactions
some people suffering intoxication have exhibited headaches up to ten hours afterwards
retrograde amnesia and somnolence can result following recovery
if the delay between ingestion and treatment is less than four hours activated charcoal is given
gastric lavage can be considered if the patient presents within one hour of ingestion
inducing vomiting with syrup of ipecac is no longer recommended in any poisoning situations
there is no antidote and supportive care is the mainstay of further treatment for intoxication
though sometimes referred to as a deliriant and while muscarine was first isolated from a
muscaria and as such is its namesake muscimol does not have action either as an agonist or antagonist at the muscarinic acetylcholine receptor site and therefore atropine or physostigmine as an antidote is not recommended
if a patient is delirious or agitated this can usually be treated by reassurance and if necessary physical restraints
a benzodiazepine such as diazepam or lorazepam can be used to control combativeness agitation muscular overactivity and seizures
only small doses should be used as they may worsen the respiratory depressant effects of muscimol
recurrent vomiting is rare but if present may lead to fluid and electrolyte imbalances intravenous rehydration or electrolyte replacement may be required
serious cases may develop loss of consciousness or coma and may need intubation and artificial ventilation
hemodialysis can remove the toxins although this intervention is generally considered unnecessary
with modern medical treatment the prognosis is typically good following supportive treatment
perceptual phenomena such as macropsia and micropsia may occur which may have been the inspiration for the effect of mushroom @-@ consumption in lewis carroll 's alice 's adventures in wonderland although no evidence has ever been found that linked carroll to recreational drug use
additionally a
muscaria cannot be commercially cultivated due to its mycorrhizal relationship with the roots of pine trees
however following the outlawing of psilocybin mushrooms in the united kingdom in <year> the sale of the still legal a
muscaria began increasing
professor marija gimbutas a renowned lithuanian historian reported to r
gordon wasson on the use of this mushroom in lithuania
in remote areas of lithuania amanita muscaria has been consumed at wedding feasts in which mushrooms were mixed with vodka
the professor also reported that the lithuanians used to export a
muscaria to the lapps in the far north for use in shamanic rituals
the lithuanian festivities are the only report that wasson received of ingestion of fly agaric for religious use in eastern europe
its use was known among almost all of the uralic @-@ speaking peoples of western siberia and the paleosiberian @-@ speaking peoples of the russian far east
there are only isolated reports of a
muscaria use among the tungusic and turkic peoples of central siberia and it is believed that on the whole entheogenic use of a
muscaria was not practised by these peoples
in western siberia the use of a
muscaria was restricted to shamans who used it as an alternative method of achieving a trance state
normally siberian shamans achieve trance by prolonged drumming and dancing
in eastern siberia a
muscaria was used by both shamans and laypeople alike and was used recreationally as well as religiously
in eastern siberia the shaman would take the mushrooms and others would drink his urine
this urine still containing psychoactive elements may be more potent than the a
muscaria mushrooms with fewer negative effects such as sweating and twitching suggesting that the initial user may act as a screening filter for other components in the mushroom
the koryak of eastern siberia have a story about the fly agaric wapaq which enabled big raven to carry a whale to its home
in the story the deity vahiyinin existence spat onto earth and his spittle became the wapaq and his saliva becomes the warts
after experiencing the power of the wapaq raven was so exhilarated that he told it to grow forever on earth so his children the people could learn from it
among the koryaks one report said that the poor would consume the urine of the wealthy who could afford to buy the mushrooms
i
itkonen mentions that a
muscaria was once used among the sami people sorcerers in inari would consume fly agarics with seven spots
in <year> said gholam mochtar and hartmut geerken published an article in which they claim to have discovered a tradition of medicinal and recreational use of this mushroom among a parachi @-@ speaking group in afghanistan
there are also unconfirmed reports of religious use of a
muscaria among two subarctic native american tribes
ojibwa ethnobotanist keewaydinoquay peschel reported its use among her people where it was known as the miskwedo
this information was enthusiastically received by wasson although evidence from other sources was lacking
there is also one account of a euro @-@ american who claims to have been initiated into traditional tlicho use of amanita muscaria
muscaria to produce their berserker rages was first suggested by the swedish professor samuel ödmann in <year>
ödmann based his theories on reports about the use of fly agaric among siberian shamans
the notion has become widespread since the <num> century but no contemporary sources mention this use or anything similar in their description of berserkers
muscimol is generally a mild relaxant but it can create a range of different reactions within a group of people
it is possible that it could make a person angry or cause them to be very jolly or sad jump about dance sing or give way to great fright
recently an analysis of nine different methods for preparing a
muscaria for catching flies in slovenia have shown that the release of ibotenic acid and muscimol did not depend on the solvent milk or water and that thermal and mechanical processing led to faster extraction of ibotenic acid and muscimol
gordon wasson proposed that a
muscaria was the soma talked about in the rig veda of india a claim which received widespread publicity and popular support at the time
he noted that descriptions of soma omitted any description of roots stems or seeds which suggested a mushroom and used the adjective hári dazzling or flaming which the author interprets as meaning red
one line described men urinating soma this recalled the practice of recycling urine in siberia
soma is mentioned as coming from the mountains which wasson interpreted as the mushroom having been brought in with the aryan invaders from the north
indian scholars santosh kumar dash and sachinanda padhy pointed out that both eating of mushrooms and drinking of urine were proscribed using as a source the manusmṛti
in <year> vedic scholar john brough from cambridge university rejected wasson 's theory and noted that the language was too vague to determine a description of soma
in his <year> survey hallucinogens and culture anthropologist peter t
furst evaluated the evidence for and against the identification of the fly agaric mushroom as the vedic soma concluding cautiously in its favour
muscaria in his <year> book the sacred mushroom and the cross but his theory has found little support by scholars outside the field of ethnomycology
the book was roundly discredited by academics and theologians including sir godfrey driver emeritus professor of semitic philology at oxford university and henry chadwick the dean of christ church oxford
christian author john c
king wrote a detailed rebuttal of allegro 's theory in the <year> book a christian view of the mushroom myth he notes that neither fly agarics nor their host trees are found in the middle east even though cedars and pines are found there and highlights the tenuous nature of the links between biblical and sumerian names coined by allegro
he concludes that if the theory was true the use of the mushroom must have been the best kept secret in the world as it was so well concealed for two thousand years
muscaria are water @-@ soluble
when sliced thinly or finely diced and boiled in plentiful water until thoroughly cooked it seems to be detoxified
although its consumption as a food has never been widespread the consumption of detoxified a
muscaria has been practiced in some parts of europe notably by russian settlers in siberia since at least the <num> century and likely earlier
the german physician and naturalist georg heinrich von langsdorff wrote the earliest published account on how to detoxify this mushroom in <year>
in the late <num> century the french physician félix archimède pouchet was a populariser and advocate of a
muscaria consumption comparing it to manioc an important food source in tropical south america that must be detoxified before consumption
use of this mushroom as a food source also seems to have existed in north america
a classic description of this use of a
muscaria by an african @-@ american mushroom seller in washington d
c
in the late <num> century is described by american botanist frederick vernon coville
in this case the mushroom after parboiling and soaking in vinegar is made into a mushroom sauce for steak
it is also consumed as a food in parts of japan
the most well @-@ known current use as an edible mushroom is in nagano prefecture japan
there it is primarily salted and pickled
a <year> paper by food historian william rubel and mycologist david arora gives a history of consumption of a
muscaria as a food and describes detoxification methods
they advocate that amanita muscaria be described in field guides as an edible mushroom though accompanied by a description on how to detoxify it
the authors state that the widespread descriptions in field guides of this mushroom as poisonous is a reflection of cultural bias as several other popular edible species notably morels are toxic unless properly cooked
a schedule <num> substance is a substance which may be abused or misused the manufacture possession sale or use of which should be prohibited by law except when required for medical or scientific research or for analytical teaching or training purposes with approval of commonwealth and or state or territory health authorities

garden ornaments and children 's picture books depicting gnomes and fairies such as the smurfs often show fly agarics used as seats or homes
fly agarics have been featured in paintings since the renaissance albeit in a subtle manner
in the victorian era they became more visible becoming the main topic of some fairy paintings
two of the most famous uses of the mushroom are in the video game series super mario bros
specifically two of the power @-@ up items and the platforms in several stages and the dancing mushroom sequence in the <year> disney film fantasia
the drinking of urine of those who had consumed the mushroom was commented on by anglo @-@ irish writer oliver goldsmith in his widely read <year> novel citizen of the world
the mushroom had been identified as the fly agaric by this time
other authors recorded the distortions of the size of perceived objects while intoxicated by the fungus including naturalist mordecai cubitt cooke in his books the seven sisters of sleep and a plain and easy account of british fungi
this observation is thought to have formed the basis of the effects of eating the mushroom in the <year> popular story alice 's adventures in wonderland
a hallucinogenic scarlet toadstool from lappland is featured as a plot element in charles kingsley 's <year> novel hereward the wake based on the medieval figure of the same name
thomas pynchon 's <year> novel gravity 's rainbow describes the fungus as a relative of the poisonous destroying angel and presents a detailed description of a character preparing a cookie bake mixture from harvested amanita muscaria
fly agaric shamanism is also explored in the <year> novel thursbitch by alan garner
over a period of several centuries female convicts were publicly burnt at the stake sometimes alive for a range of activities including coining and mariticide
while men guilty of heresy were also burned at the stake those who committed high treason were instead hanged drawn and quartered
the english jurist william blackstone supposed that the difference in sentencing although full as terrible to the sensation as the other could be explained by the desire not to publicly expose a woman 's body
public executions were well @-@ attended affairs and contemporary reports detail the cries of women on the pyre as they were burned alive
it later became commonplace for the executioner to strangle the convict and for the body to be burned post @-@ mortem
in the latter half of the eighteenth century changing attitudes to such public displays prompted sir benjamin hammett mp to denounce the practice in parliament
his bill by no means the first such attempt to end the public burning of women led to the treason act <year> which abolished the sentence
high treason defined as transgressions against the sovereign was first codified during king edward iii 's reign by the treason act <num>
it clarified exactly what crimes constituted treason following earlier somewhat over zealous interpretations of england 's legal codes
for instance high treason could be committed by anyone found to be compassing the king 's death or counterfeiting his coin
high treason remained distinct though from what became known as petty treason the killing of a lawful superior such as a husband by his wife
though twelfth century contemporary authors made few attempts to differentiate between high treason and petty treason enhanced punishments may indicate that the latter was treated more seriously than an ordinary felony
as the most egregious offence an individual could commit viewed as seriously as though the accused had personally attacked the monarch high treason demanded the ultimate punishment
but whereas men guilty of this crime were hanged drawn and quartered women were drawn and burned
in his commentaries on the laws of england the <num> @-@ century english jurist william blackstone noted that the sentence to be drawn to the gallows and there to be burned alive was full as terrible to the sensation as the other
blackstone wrote that women were burned rather than quartered as the decency due to the sex forbids the exposing and publicly mangling their bodies
however an observation by historian jules michelet that the first flame to rise consumed the clothes revealing poor trembling nakedness may in the opinion of historian vic gatrell suggest that this solution is misconceived
in the hanging tree gatrell concludes that the occasional live burial of women in europe gave tacit acknowledgement to the possibility that a struggling kicking female hanging from a noose could elicit obscene fantasies from watching males
it allowed for the execution of persons of both sexes found guilty of heresy thought to be sacrilegious and dangerous to souls but also seditious and treasonable
bishops were empowered to arrest and imprison anyone suspected of offences related to heresy and once convicted send them to be burned in the presence of the people in a lofty place
although the act was repealed in <year> <num> it was revived over <num> years later at the request of queen mary i who during the marian persecutions made frequent use of the punishment it allowed
de heretico comburendo was repealed by the act of supremacy <year> although that act allowed ecclesiastical commissions to deal with occasional instances of heresy
persons declared guilty such as bartholomew legate and edward wightman could still be burned under a writ of de heretico comburendo issued by the court of chancery
the burning of heretics was finally ended by the ecclesiastical jurisdiction act <year> which although it allowed ecclesiastical courts to charge people with atheism blasphemy heresy schism or other damnable doctrine or opinion limited their power to excommunication
for the killing in <year> of anne askew charged with heresy and tortured at the tower of london a substancyall stage was built to seat the various officials who presided over her burning
a witness to proceedings reported that askew was so badly injured by her torture that she was unable to stand
instead the dounge carte was holden up betwene ij sarjantes perhaptes syttyng there in a cheare
a pamphlet detailing the burning in april <year> of joan peterson the so @-@ called witch of wapping also describes the execution of prudence lee found guilty of mariticide
lee was apparently brought on foot between two sheriff 's officers and dressed in a red waistcoat to the place of execution in smithfield
there she confessed to having been a very lewd liver and much given to cursing and swearing for which the lord being offended with her had suffered her to be brought to that untimely end
she admitted to being jealous of and arguing with her husband and stabbing him with a knife
the executioner put her in a pitch barrel tied her to the stake placed the fuel and faggots around her and set them alight
lee was reported to have desired all that were present to pray for her and feeling the flames shrike d out terribly some five or six several times
burning alive for murder was abolished in <year> although burning for adultery remained
thereafter out of mercy the condemned were often strangled before the flames took hold
notable exceptions to this practice were the burnings in <year> and <year> of elizabeth gaunt found guilty of high treason for her part in the rye house plot and catherine hayes for petty treason
hayes apparently rent the air with her cries and lamentations when the fire was lit too early preventing the executioner from strangling her in time
she became the last woman in england to be burned alive
the law also allowed for the hanging of children aged seven years or more
mary troke but sixteen years of age was burned at winchester in <year> for poisoning her mistress
an unidentified <num> @-@ year @-@ old girl imprisoned at newgate was more fortunate
found guilty in <year> of being an accomplice to treason for concealing whitewashed farthings on her person at her master 's request she had been sentenced to burn
she was saved by the intervention of thomas thynne 1st marquess of bath who happened to be passing
watched by a reported <num> @,@ <num> people she was led to the stake and stood on a stool where a noose attached to an iron bolt driven into the top of the stake was placed around her neck
as prayers were read the stool was taken away and over the course of several minutes her feet kicking as her body convulsed harris choked to death
about <num> minutes later faggots were placed around the stake her body was chained into position and subsequently burned for over two hours
executions like this had once passed with little to no comment in the press
historically while fewer women than men were subjected to capital punishment proportionately more were acquitted found guilty of lesser charges or pardoned if condemned
in centuries past these women were judged by publications such as the newgate calendar to have succumbed to their own perversions or to have been led astray
but while <num> and <num> @-@ century women guilty of treasonable crimes were still seen as villains increasingly the cause of their descent was ascribed to villainous men
those people concerned about the brutality inflicted on condemned women were in gatrell 's opinion activated by the sense that even at their worst women were creatures to be pitied and protected from themselves and perhaps revered like all women from whom men were born
commenting on harris 's execution the daily universal register claimed that the act reflected a scandal upon the law a disgrace to the police and was not only inhuman but shamefully indelicate and shocking
the newspaper asked why should the law in this species of offence inflict a severer punishment upon a woman than upon a man harris 's fate prompted william wilberforce to sponsor a bill which if passed would have abolished the practice
but as one of its proposals would have allowed the anatomical dissection of criminals other than murderers the house of lords rejected it
though sympathetic to reform of england 's bloody code lord chief justice loughborough saw no need to change the law although the punishment as a spectacle was rather attended with circumstances of horror likely to make a more strong impression on the beholders than mere hanging the effect was much the same as in fact no greater degree of personal pain was sustained the criminal being always strangled before the flames were suffered to approach the body
when on <num> june <year> margaret sullivan was hanged and burned for coining the same newspaper by then called the times wrote there is something so inhuman in burning a woman for what only subjects a man to hanging that human nature shudders at the idea
must not mankind laugh as our long speeches against african slavery — and our fine sentiments on indian cruelties when just in the very eye of the sovereign we roast a female fellow creature alive for putting a pennyworth of quicksilver on a half @-@ penny worth of brass
the savage barbarity of the punishment — and the smallness of the offence in the eye of god are contrasts that should meet the consideration of government
the gentleman 's magazine addressed the prime minister william pitt the younger the woman was brought out attended by a priest of the romish persuasion and as soon as she came to the stake she was placed upon a stool which was instantly removed from under her and she left suspended when the faggots were placed around her and being set on fire she was soon consumed to ashes
— mr
pitt himself a lawyer tis hoped will not suffer this cruel remain of savage legislation to escape his notice and continue a disgrace to the enlightened sense of this country
although in his objections to wilberforce 's <year> bill loughborough had noted that these women were dead long before they suffered the flames many newspapers of the day made no such distinction
the times incorrectly stated that sullivan was burned alive rhetoric which in dr simon devereaux 's opinion could be rooted in the growing reverence for domesticated womanhood that might have been expected at the time
as many objections may also have been raised by the perceived iniquity of drawing and burning women for coining whereas until <year> when the halting of executions at tyburn removed ritualistic dragging from public view men were simply drawn and hanged
a widening gulf between the numbers of men and women whipped in london during the <num> <num> men versus <num> women which mirrors a similar decline in the sending of women to the pillory may also indicate an imposition of commonly @-@ held gender ideals on english penal practices
hammett was also an mp and in <year> he introduced to parliament a bill for altering the sentence of burning women
he denounced the punishment as the savage remains of norman policy which disgraced our statutes as the practice did the common law
he also highlighted how a sheriff who refused to carry out the sentence was liable to prosecution
william wilberforce and hammett were not the first men to attempt to end the burning of women
almost <num> years earlier during the interregnum a group of lawyers and laymen known as the hale commission after its chairman matthew hale was tasked by the house of commons to take into consideration what inconveniences there are in the law
among the proposed reforms was the replacement of burning at the stake with hanging but mainly through the objections of various interested parties none of the commission 's proposals made it into law during the rump parliament
hammett was confident though
he believed that public opinion was on his side and that the house would go with him in the cause of humanity
the change in execution venues from tyburn to newgate also attracted criticism
following phoebe harris 's burning in <year> as well as questioning the inequality of english law the times complained about the location of the punishment and its effect on locals when remission of burning was refused the scene of inhumanity should have been changed the consequences have been serious several persons in the neighbourhood of newgate lying ill have been severely affected by the smoke which issued from the body of the unhappy female victim
another factor was the fate of sophia girton found guilty of coining
hammett 's bill was introduced only four days before girton 's fate was to be decided but a petition for her respite from burning supported by another sheriff of london either thomas baker or william newman and brought to king george iii 's notice by william grenville proved successful
devereaux suggests that her impending fate lent weight to the eventual outcome of hammett 's bill which was to abolish the burning of women for treason through the treason act <year>
christian murphy who at her execution in <year> was drest in a clean striped gown a white ribbon and a black ribbon round her cap was the last woman in england to be burned
it runs just over <num> ⁄ <num> mile <num> @,@ <num> m from trafalgar square eastwards to temple bar where the road becomes fleet street inside the city of london and is part of the a4 a main road running west from inner london

on january <num> <year> sisler was re @-@ signed by the red sox
the red sox expected sisler to be a candidate for a pitching rotation slot
he impressed his coaching staff during early spring practices manager mike pinky higgins commented that sisler looks good he 's more mature and shows more confidence
when the regular season began he was initially effective winning three games against one defeat in his first four starts including two complete game victories against the yankees
at this point he was <num> – <num> against the yankees earning him the moniker yankee killer from sportswriter chester l
smith of the pittsburgh press
although his era of <num>
<num> was considered high it was due in large part to his loss against the kansas city athletics who scored six earned runs in just two innings
on july <num> he defeated the yankees once again making him <num> – <num> against them in his career and <num> – <num> overall for the <year> season and had lowered his era to <num>

he recorded just one more victory in <year> and completed the season with an <num> – <num> record a <num>
<num> era and <num> strikeouts in a career @-@ high <num> <num> innings pitched
on february <num> <year> the red sox announced that they had sisler signed for the <year> season
after what was considered a disappointing season he did not impress with his first outing in spring training giving up two hits and five bases on balls in just two innings of work
lack of pitching depth was a noted weakness for the red sox entering the season with unpredictable youth and with hopes that sisler could regain his previous level of success
sisler opened the season slated as a relief pitcher with the idea that he would start in certain cases
in three relief appearances through april he had a <num>
<num> era in <num> <num> inning pitched
management decided that his performance along with a pitching staff that they considered inexperienced sisler and ted lepcio were traded to the detroit tigers on may <num> for starting pitcher billy hoeft
the tigers had lost <num> of their first <num> games of the season before the trade and decided that changes were needed
in addition to the sisler trade they fired manager bill norman and replaced him with jimmy dykes
these moves initially proved effective sparking a winning game streak which began by defeating the yankees in both games of a doubleheader on may <num>
continuing their rebound the tigers faced the red sox next winning two of three and sisler pitched a scoreless one @-@ inning relief appearance against his former team on may <num>
used exclusively in relief sisler pitched in <num> games for the tigers winning one game against three losses and collected seven saves which was seventh most in the al and he did not record an error
sisler returned to the tigers for the <year> season and manager dykes noted that he was not confident that his bullpen could help when needed pointing to the previous season as a reference
the tigers bullpen had won just nine games in <year> but began <year> with three straight victories with sisler pitching a scoreless two @-@ inning appearance on april <num>
his performance was considered a surprise due to having a poor spring training

<num> and had a <num> – <num> record
it was at this point in the season that he began to turn his fortunes around and regained his effectiveness and by august <num> he had lowered his era to <num>
<num>
his season totals included a <num>
<num> era and a <num> @-@ <num> win @-@ loss record both career bests and added six saves in <num> innings pitched

although he was thought of as the tigers best reliever during the season sisler was listed by the tigers as eligible for the <year> major league baseball expansion draft
the draft occurred on december <num> <year> and sisler was selected by the washington senators with the fourth overall pick
the senators received communication from several teams that were interested in sisler namely the milwaukee braves of the national league nl and the athletics but decided to trade their first pick in the expansion draft bobby shantz instead
new manager mickey vernon defined sisler 's role with the team before the season began designating him as their top relief pitcher
sisler felt slighted by the tigers having been left unprotected by the team and had considered retiring from baseball but ultimately decided to sign with the senators
sisler was solid for much of the first half of the season not allowing an earned run until may <num> and by june <num> he had an era of <num>
<num> a <num> – <num> record with seven saves
it was at the point that his effectiveness declined rapidly allowing runs to score in four of his next five appearances
in a game against the red sox on june <num> he relieved starter carl mathias and immediately gave up bases on balls to the first two batters he faced which forced in two runs then gave up a grand slam to jim pagliaroni
he followed with another base on balls and was relieved without having recording an out
over the course of the next couple months with his era steadily rising his playing time was lessened making just six appearances in the month of july and five in august
he made his last major league start on august <num> against the tigers giving up seven hits and six earned runs for the loss
in <num> total appearances in <year> he had a <num> – <num> win @-@ loss record and finished sixth in al with <num> saves
on september <num> the senators agreed to send <num> @,@ <num> <num> @,@ <num> current dollar adjustment and a player to be named later to the cincinnati reds of the nl for pitcher claude osteen
to complete the transaction washington sent sisler to the reds as that player named on november <num>
sisler who was expected to be used as a relief pitcher joined a reds team that already had his brother dick who was their first base coach
his father still with pittsburgh mentioned that he was relieved that his son did not play in a recent series between the pirates and reds recalling how the mixed emotions he felt when his elder son dick helped defeat the dodgers in an important game in <year> by hitting a home run
the younger sisler 's season did not begin well in his ten appearances by june <num> he allowed a run in all but three and had a <num>
<num> era
on june <num> sisler pitched a scoreless inning in victory against the pirates the time first time george watched his son pitch as an opponent
although sisler 's season was a disappointment he completed the season well allowing just one earned run over the course of his final eight games as well as earning the victory on september <num> his final major league appearance
his totals for the season included a <num> – <num> record a <num>
<num> era and one save in <num> <num> innings pitched

petersburg florida when the stockbrokers were invited to play in season @-@ ending tournament to decide a champion sisler a senior executive for the firm denied the funding for the team forcing them to decline if no other monies were raised
it was an unexpected decision considering that sisler was former baseball player but he did not feel that a
g
edwards was benefitting with the costs of running the team becoming more than originally agreed to by contract
in <year> the possibility arose of his father 's record of <num> hits in a season being surpassed by ichiro suzuki of the seattle mariners
living in dallas texas at the time sisler and his son dave followed ichiro 's progress throughout the season
both had mixed feelings about the record chase they were happy that george sisler 's name was being talked about and that people were re @-@ discovering him as a player but both were hoping that if the record was not broken in <num> games there would be an asterisk noting that it took ichiro more games to achieve it
ichiro finished the season with <num> hits and the mariners extended an invitation for the entire sisler family to attend the celebration at safeco field
the younger sisler was prevented by an emergency heart procedure from travelling to seattle
both remarked that the mariners were a classy organization for extending the invitation

hamels was traded to the texas rangers in <year> where he sparked their run to the al west title
he was a gifted student and scored a <year> out of <year> on the sat

we know their names because october was their kind of month and they belong on that list because they once did something very few pitchers have ever done
they all won four starts in the same postseason
and now they have company
a <num> @-@ year @-@ old left @-@ hander named cole hamels
and with every time the phillies handed him the baseball in october <year> it became more apparent that he is one of the sports most special talents
the philadelphia chapter of the baseball writers association of america presented him the steve carlton most valuable pitcher award for the second consecutive year
<num> million contract with the phillies
on february <num> the first day of spring training for pitchers and catchers when asked who the opening day starter would be manager charlie manuel responded yeah you might as well go ahead and pencil him in
i don 't think there 's any sense in me playing games
go ahead pencil him in
however hamels left spring training on march <num> after feeling tightness between innings and flew to philadelphia to have his left elbow examined by dr
michael ciccotti
this will obviously set me back a couple of days and i don 't think that should be a big deal said hamels
ciccotti found no structural damage in his arm yet hamels still did not pitch on opening day as expected myers did for the third consecutive season
for the first time in his career he went winless in his first four starts and left back @-@ to @-@ back starts early due to injury in late april sustaining a left @-@ shoulder contusion and an ankle sprain respectively
from june on however he returned to his previous form recording two complete @-@ game shutouts tied for the nl @-@ lead striking out at least <num> batters in two separate games and amassing a <num> @-@ inning scoreless streak from august <num> to september <num> while allowing just two home runs in his final eight starts
in july the phillies augmented their starting rotation by acquiring two former cy young award winners in cliff lee and pedro martínez from a trade and a free agent signing respectively
due to his early season injury struggles hamels posted a <num> – <num> record and a <num>
<num> era in the regular season his first major league season in which he posted a sub-
<num> record and the worst era of his career to that point
hamels started game <num> of the <year> national league division series against the colorado rockies allowing four earned runs through five innings to take the loss
nevertheless the phillies won the series three games to one
he earned the win in game <num> of the national league championship series as the phillies beat the dodgers <num> – <num>
hamels started game <num> of the world series against the new york yankees pitching <num> <num> ⁄ <num> innings allowing <num> earned runs and taking the loss as the yankees won that game <num> @-@ <num>
afterward he told reporters i can 't wait for it the season to end
it 's been mentally draining
it 's one of those things where a year in you just can ’ t wait for a fresh start
later in the series after the phillies won game five a confrontational brett myers mockingly asked hamels what are you doing here i thought you quit
the phillies lost the world series to the new york yankees in six games
rob neyer a sabermetrician and columnist for espn
com contradicted anyone who asserted hamels skills had deteriorated instead commenting last october everybody was ready to anoint hamels some sort of superhero
this was largely because he went <num> – <num> during the phillies championship run but also because he went <num> – <num> with a <num>
<num> era during the regular season
last season hamels strikeout @-@ to @-@ walk ratio was <num>
<num> this year it 's <num>
<num>
last year hamels gave up <num>
<num> home runs per nine innings this year he 's given up <num>
<num> homers per nine
the only real difference between the <year> hamels and the <year> hamels is luck
phillies pitching coach rich dubee and hamels himself blamed hamels demeanor for some of his decline noting he is such a perfectionist … his approach wasn ’ t very good last year
his success won ’ t come back until his demeanor changes and the more angry you get it 's that much tougher to execute your next pitch
i think i let expectations get to me respectively
they did not re @-@ sign myers and halladay was named the phillies opening day starter
among hamels season highlights were a start on june <num> against the san diego padres during which he threw <num> ⁄ <num> innings of no @-@ hit baseball winning five consecutive starts including three consecutive scoreless starts from late @-@ august to mid @-@ september and striking out <num> batters tied for his second @-@ highest career total on september <num> against the florida marlins

<num> era the latter of which was at the time a career @-@ best
he also struck out a career high <num> batters
throughout the season he was plagued by a lack of run support in <num> ⁄ <num> of his starts the phillies did not score a single run while he was in the game
moreover he received the fifth @-@ lowest run support in the nl
nevertheless he allowed three or fewer earned runs in <num> of his <num> starts
jeff nelson facetiously evaluated hamels season as follows headcase
immature
soft
unprepared
he wouldn ’ t pitch on three @-@ days rest if asked
he 's not a big game pitcher
he sounds like a whiny <num> @-@ year old – these were some of the descriptions i heard and read from many phillies fans following cole hamels ’ disappointing <year> season
heck some people even wanted him traded after what he said during the ’ <num> world series
to the naked eye cole just wasn ’ t right two years ago
fast forward a year later and hamels all the sudden ‘ found his game
’ he ‘ flicked a switch ’ or ‘ put his game face on
’ he was more prepared heading in to <year> or he was cured from the verducci effect
after this signing the phillies starting rotation consisted of roy halladay roy oswalt cliff lee cole hamels and joe blanton
this rotation was considered one of the best in pitching history by many

hamels shared his dismay with this rule saying it 's one of those things where people who don 't play the game make the rules
the phillies finished with the best record in mlb for the second year in a row
in the <year> national league division series against the st
louis cardinals hamels started game <num> which resulted in a <num> @-@ <num> win to give the phillies a <num> @-@ <num> series lead however the phillies would lose games <num> and <num> to be eliminated

the philadelphia chapter of the baseball writers association of america presented him the steve carlton most valuable pitcher award
in his first career opening day start on april <num> against the atlanta braves hamels surrendered five earned runs in five innings and took the loss
particularly early in the season hamels was plagued by a lack of run support as of may <num> he had the fifth @-@ lowest in the major leagues
he lost his eighth start on may <num> declining to a record of <num> – <num> which one sports illustrated column attributed more to the phillies poor offense than hamels
nevertheless it was easily
hamels ’ worst performance of his eight @-@ year career
aside from offensive struggles while hamels was pitching the phillies defense struggled though hamels kept a positive attitude once commenting that his luck should improve as i 've been doing pretty well on the plane in poker
towards the end of the season however hamels put it together in his final <num> starts
he surrendered more than three runs only once
in total he amassed an <num> – <num> record with a <num>
<num> era in <num> innings and <num> strikeouts sixth in nl
despite struggles from his teammates bill baer noted that hamels
was worse at generating swings and misses
his strikeout rate declined by <num>
<num> percent and his overall swinging strike rate declined by <num>
<num> percent
that doesn ’ t seem like a whole lot but consider that opposing hitters swung at <num> @,@ <num> pitches during the <year> season
a <num>
<num> percent decrease means <num> fewer swings and misses
that 's a combination of <num> more balls in play or foul balls prolonging an at @-@ bat
despite hamels poor record and era <num> of his <num> starts were quality starts and thus he gave his team a chance to win <num> times yet only got eight wins
on april <num> hamels pitched in a minor league class a @-@ advanced game striking out four while allowing two earned runs on three hits in four innings

on september <num> hamels pitched six innings of a phillies combined no @-@ hitter against the atlanta braves
hamels was pulled for a pinch hitter in the top of the seventh due to having five walks a hit @-@ batter and <num> pitches through six innings
overall hamels was the only consistent star on the phillies finished sixth in cy young voting and was frequently mentioned as a candidate to be traded in the offseason to bolster the phillies lackluster farm system after he avoided being dealt at the july trading deadline
the boston red sox los angeles dodgers texas rangers chicago cubs new york yankees and san francisco giants expressed interest in trading for him during the <year> season
on july <num> <year> in what would be his final start for the phillies before being traded hamels no @-@ hit the chicago cubs <num> – <num> at wrigley field striking out <num> and only giving up two walks both to dexter fowler and besting the cubs jake arrieta — himself a no @-@ hit pitcher a month later on august <num> of that season
it was the first no @-@ hitter against the cubs since sandy koufax 's perfect game in <year> and first at wrigley since the cubs milt pappas in <year>
hamels also joined vida blue mike witt kent mercker and kevin millwood as no @-@ hit pitchers who also pitched in a combined no @-@ hitter
hamels became the first pitcher to be traded during a regular season after pitching a no @-@ hitter in his final start with the team that traded him
bert blyleven had been the last pitcher to pitch a no @-@ hitter in his final start with the team that traded him after pitching a no @-@ hitter for the rangers in his final start of the <year> season he was traded to the pittsburgh pirates that offseason
with the rangers hamels went <num> @-@ <num> in <num> starts with a <num>
<num> era
the rangers were under
<num> as late as august <num> but posted a winning record for the remainder of the <year> season and eventually overtook the houston astros in september for the american league west division lead
the rangers clinched the al west title on the final day of the season as hamels threw a complete @-@ game three @-@ hitter in a <num> @-@ <num> win over the los angeles angels the team 's <num> division title and <num> postseason appearance in franchise history
hamels positive effect on the rangers was compared to that of the toronto blue jays david price another ace starting pitcher who helped spearhead a run to the postseason after blending in seamlessly with a struggling team who acquired him at the trade deadline

hamels started game <num> and was pulled in the bottom of the <num> inning while the rangers were leading <num> @-@ <num> the jays subsequently scored <num> runs to win <num> @-@ <num> and hamels was charged with the loss as he was responsible for the runners on base
starting in <year> the texas rangers have a special cheering section known as hamels heroes whenever hamels starts at globe life park
it was inspired by the success of the seattle mariners king 's court for felix hernandez
hamels was named the opening day starter for the rangers in <year>
on opening day after allowing two home runs in two innings hamels calmed down to pitch <num> strong innings while only allowing two runs on <num> hits and <num> strikeouts for a <year> opening day win against the seattle mariners
on june <num> in a start against seattle hamels recorded his <num> career strikeout becoming the <num> player and <num> active player to reach the milestone
in <year> fangraphs ranked hamels as having the fourth best changeup in the game trailing only jason vargas tommy milone and félix hernández
the hardball times called his changeup a killer pitch to right @-@ handed hitters noting that while it is also effective against left @-@ handed hitters when they put it in play they generally have success
rangers pitching coach mike maddux said of hamels it 's a difficult task to try to get young guys to throw changeups because their whole amateur career is spent staring at the scout with the gun
for a young guy to have a good changeup that 's an aptitude right there
it 's pitchability
the development of hamels changeup is attributed by his high school pitching coach mark furtak to the fact that in high school he broke his arm
he could no longer work on his curveball for several months and was forced to focus on the changeup
chipper jones who was a star @-@ third baseman for the rival atlanta braves commented that hamels is the best lefthander in the national league
you have to respect his fastball and his change @-@ up is devastating
if you 're guessing fastball and you get change @-@ up you 're way out in front of it
his change @-@ up is a soft sinker that just falls down
aside from the changeup he throws a four @-@ seam fastball in the low <num> can reach <num> to <num> miles per hour <num> to <num> km h a cutter <num> to <num> miles per hour <num> to <num> km h and an inconsistent curveball that sometimes loops and other times is sharp and hovers in the mid @-@ <num> around <num> to <num> miles per hour <num> to <num> km h
prior to the conception and advent of his cutter he briefly threw a two @-@ seam fastball around <year> and <year> before debuting his cutter in <year>
once he attained a feel for how to effectively utilize his cutter it helped him increase his groundball rate percentage of balls in play that were groundballs including to over <num> @-@ percent in <year>
he grew up in san diego where his parents still live
he now resides in newtown square pennsylvania with his wife heidi strobel whom he married on december <num> <year> but they are making plans to move to the dallas texas area full @-@ time during the <year> offseason
strobel was a contestant on the sixth season of the reality show survivor the amazon
they had their first child son caleb michael on october <num> <year> and their second son braxton on november <num> <year>
on december <num> <year> they adopted a baby girl from ethiopia named reeve

charmed follows the supernatural adventures of the charmed ones a trio of sisters known as the most powerful witches of all time
the character was created by executive producer brad kern and was portrayed by actress charisma carpenter
carpenter was invited on the show after acting with charmed cast member holly marie combs on the abc family television film see jane date <year>
the actress original contract was a guest star role that included three episodes in season seven with media outlets reporting the possibility of carpenter becoming a series regular
a demon characterized by her powers of divination and precognition she eventually forms a friendship with leo wyatt brian krause and the charmed ones specifically phoebe halliwell alyssa milano after expressing her desire to become human
despite being killed by the demon zankou oded fehr on the show the character makes further canonical appearances in the comic book series charmed season <num>
her storylines focus on her involvement with witch prue halliwell 's new destiny and her romantic relationship with the newly revived benjamin turner the father of cole turner
the kyra character has received mixed feedback from critics and has been defined by her sex appeal and called overtly sexual coy and kitteny and tasty
critics have positively and negatively compared the role to carpenter 's previous performance as cordelia chase on the supernatural dramas buffy the vampire slayer <year> and angel <year> demian of television without pity criticized the character as a copy of chase because of her lack of a unique identity
kyra was created as a separate character from the seer debbi morgan who was featured as the primary antagonist in the second half of season four
carpenter joked that she was surprised to be considered for such a minor part on the show as a guest star
in an interview with her official fansite charmed cast member rose mcgowan stated that she looked forward to new characters like kyra and kyle brody joining the show saying w e are all delighted to have them on board
according to kristin veitch of tv guide representatives from the wb television network the wb released a statement indicating the possibility of kyra being promoted to star billing
in august <year> carpenter was set to star in a upn mid @-@ season replacement comedy called like cats and dogs but she expressed interest in doing more episodes of charmed if the pilot was not picked up by the network
she stated while she enjoyed working in the supernatural genre and viewed it as familiar territory she was hesitant about committing to the show 's demanding shooting schedule as it would take time away from raising her son
kyra was one of three characters with precognition that carpenter has played in her career including cordelia chase from supernatural dramas buffy the vampire slayer and angel and heather from the syfy horror film voodoo moon <year>
in an interview with film journal static mass emporium carpenter did not personally identify as a vision girl but described feeling a love for roles involving seers
she felt that the emphasis on sexuality was the main aspect of the character 's personality calling her overtly sexual coy and kitteny
while she viewed chase as a smartass carpenter defined kyra as a temptress and a jezebel and opined that her flirtatious banter with leo wyatt was meant to be a part of her own agenda
she stated that the way she portrayed kyra was influenced by her revealing outfit feeling that every woman on charmed had to look and act hot and notoriously sexy
pat shand the writer of charmed season <num> said he incorporated kyra in the comic book series as he enjoyed her dialogue and carpenter 's performance of the character he wrote to write dialogue for a character played by charisma is to hear charisma in your head
who would turn that down
shand commended carpenter 's ability to voice characters in a very unique rhythm and called the process of replicating that energy in the form of comics as a blast and super easy in comparison with the show 's other characters
when discussing the development of the season shand said that the pairing of kyra and prue halliwell 's storylines was a natural fit especially since both characters were his favorites from the series
he clarified that kyra 's return specifically her relationship with benjamin was central to the season and called it straight up plot and inextricable from prue 's storylines in response to fans concerns about the character being limited to being part of a subplot
while the two women never interacted on the show he explained that prue sifted through all of the seers in all of the history to see who best tell her what 's the deal with her new powers and destiny
shand said kyra was a vital part of prue 's plans to perform the advent a ritual that would resurrect a powerful race of evil demons known as the old ones
she is shown as possessing the powers of precognition and divination through the use of a magical pool
she later works with the half @-@ demon sirk on his plans to track down and kill his mortal relatives in order to seal his transformation as a full demon
as a demon kyra cannot feel emotions but she is shown to be curious about the world of mortals
longing to experience the emotions she sees in her visions she contacts the elders a council of whitelighters which governs the forces of good to make a deal where she would trade her information on the then unknown threat the avatars if she is made human
the avatars are later revealed to a group of magical beings capable of warping reality who devote themselves to creating a world without good or evil
as word of kyra 's betrayal spreads across the underworld leo is sent to save her and bring her to the halliwell manor during the negotiations
while at the manor kyra bonds with phoebe halliwell alyssa milano over their shared powers of premonition
she guides phoebe and lieutenant darryl morris dorian gregory to inspector sheridan jenya lano a member of the san francisco police department who was placed in a coma by fbi agent kyle brody kerr smith brody had sequestered sheridan after she discovered the truth about the halliwell sisters being witches
kyra shares her premonition of the avatars with phoebe
while the prior episodes established the avatar as a threat kyra 's vision shows phoebe and her future daughter living in a utopia where demons no longer exist
after witnessing the vision phoebe has a premonition of the demon zankou oded fehr vanquishing kyra
in order to prevent kyra 's death phoebe convinces the elders to provide a spell to turn kyra human
during this time kyra forces leo to reveal his true identity as an avatar to the sisters
while piper halliwell holly marie combs helps her to prepare for her new life as a mortal kyra reveals her real name and abandons her title as the seer
before the sisters can transform kyra into a mortal zankou kills her because of her betrayal of the demonic world and his fear of what she might tell the sisters
her death is a turning point in the season as it pushes the sisters to agree to meet and to help the avatars build their new world
after completing a ritual that allowed prue to enter her own mind she turns kyra human
despite being overjoyed at her transformation kyra is uncertain about her plans for the future
she decides to reconnect with the other halliwell sisters and devote her life to doing good
she begins by helping the newly resurrected benjamin turner who is the father of cole turner julian mcmahon readjust to his new life
as they spend more time together kyra falls in love with benjamin and they start a romantic relationship
at the end of issue <num> tribunal and tribulations prue kidnaps kyra along with bejnamin and the archai a magical being capable of opening portals through reality tyler michaels and takes them to a space deep within the earth
television critic melanie mcfarland of the seattle post @-@ intelligencer deemed the character a tasty demon seer and entertainment news website hypable 's karen rought praised her as being the most memorable incarnation of the seer and a fitting role for carpenter after her previous performance as chase
spoilertv 's gavin hetherington called kyra a great highlight of the season
charmed magazine 's tara dilullo viewed carpenter as the perfect actress to play kyra as she spent the better part of her career facing down the supernatural with a snark and a smile
in an article from today reader patrick kelly cited carpenter 's appearance on charmed as an indicator of her popularity among the <num> to <num> @-@ year @-@ old male demographic
nadim of nad 's reviews opined that carpenter should have been offered a permanent part on the show pat shand criticized the show 's decision to kill the character saying that she would have filled the role of the fourth main character or non @-@ charmed one getting all that screen time in season eight rather than novice witch billie jenkins kaley cuoco
he added that he wished that the character had a spin @-@ off with cole turner and darryl morris
demian of television without pity praised the show 's decision to hire an actor from one of joss whedon 's shows but was critical of kyra 's introduction in the episode cheaper by the coven saying that carpeter was misused and given so little to do
he referred to the character negatively as cordelia lite
parodying the character 's lack of a concrete identity he referenced kyra as charisma and cordelia in his recaps of the later episodes
the first subfossil remains were found in <year> and the ibis was first scientifically described in <year>
its closest relatives are the malagasy sacred ibis the african sacred ibis and the straw @-@ necked ibis
travellers accounts from the <num> and <num> centuries described a white bird that flew with difficulty and it was subsequently referred to as the réunion solitaire
in the mid <num> century the old travellers accounts were incorrectly assumed to refer to white relatives of the dodo due to one account specifically mentioning dodos on the island and because <num> @-@ century paintings of white dodos had recently surfaced
however no fossils referable to dodo @-@ like birds were ever found on réunion and it was later questioned whether the paintings had anything to do with the island
other identities were suggested as well based only on speculation
in the late <num> century the discovery of a subfossil ibis led to the idea that the old accounts actually referred to an ibis species instead
the idea that the solitaire and the subfossil ibis are identical has only met with limited dissent and is now widely accepted
combined the old descriptions and subfossils show that the réunion ibis was mainly white with this colour merging into yellow and grey
the wing tips and plumes of ostrich @-@ like feathers on its rear were black
the neck and legs were long the beak was relatively straight and short for an ibis
it was more robust in build than its extant relatives but was otherwise quite similar to them
subfossil wing @-@ bones indicate it had reduced flight capabilities a feature perhaps linked to seasonal fattening
the diet of the réunion ibis was worms and other items foraged from soil
it preferred solitude hence the name solitaire
in the <num> century it lived in mountainous areas but it may have been confined to these remote heights by heavy hunting by humans and predation by introduced animals in the more accessible areas of the island
visitors to réunion praised its flavour and therefore sought after its flesh
these factors are believed to have driven the réunion ibis to extinction by the early <num> century
the supposed white dodo of réunion is now believed to have been an erroneous conjecture based on the few contemporary reports which described the réunion ibis combined with paintings of white dodos from mauritius by the dutch painters pieter withoos and pieter holsteyn ii and derivatives from the <num> century that surfaced in the <num> century
the english chief officer john tatton was the first to mention a specifically white bird on réunion in <year>
the french occupied the island from <year> and onwards and referred to this bird as the solitaire
m
carré of the french east indies company described the solitaire in <year> explaining the reason for its name i saw a kind of bird in this place which i have not found elsewhere it is that which the inhabitants call the oiseaux solitaire for to be sure it loves solitude and only frequents the most secluded places one never sees two or more together it is always alone
it is not unlike a turkey if it did not have longer legs
the beauty of its plumage is a delight to see
it is of changeable colour which verges upon yellow
the flesh is exquisite it forms one of the best dishes in this country and might form a dainty at our tables
we wished to keep two of these birds to send to france and present them to his majesty but as soon as they were on board ship they died of melancholy having refused to eat or drink
a marooned french huguenot françois leguat used the name solitaire for the raphine bird he encountered on the nearby island of rodrigues in the <num> but it is thought he borrowed the name from a <year> tract by marquis henri duquesne which mentioned the réunion species
duquesne himself had probably based his own description on an earlier one
no specimens of the solitaire were ever preserved
the two individuals carré attempted to send to the royal menagerie in france did not survive in captivity
billiard claimed that bertrand @-@ françois mahé de la bourdonnais sent a solitaire to france from réunion around <year>
since the réunion ibis is believed to have gone extinct by this date the bird may actually have been a rodrigues solitaire
the only contemporary writer who referred specifically to dodos inhabiting réunion was the dutch sailor willem ysbrandtszoon bontekoe though he did not mention their colouration there were also dod @-@ eersen old dutch for dodos which have small wings and so far from being able to fly they were so fat that they could scarcely walk and when they tried to run they dragged their under side along the ground
when his journal was published in <year> it was accompanied by an engraving which is now known to have been copied after one of the dodos in the flemish painter roelant savery 's crocker art gallery sketch
since bontekoe was shipwrecked and lost all his belongings after visiting réunion in <year> he may not have written his account until he returned to holland seven years later which would put its reliability in question
he may have concluded in hindsight that it was a dodo finding what he saw similar to accounts of that bird
it is unclear why he included réunion but he also combined accounts about the rodrigues solitaire and a third bird oiseau de nazareth now thought to be a dodo under the same section
english naturalist hugh edwin strickland discussed the old descriptions of the réunion solitaire in his <year> book the dodo and its kindred and concluded it was distinct from the dodo and rodrigues solitaire
baron edmond de sélys longchamps coined the scientific name apterornis solitarius for the réunion solitaire in <year> apparently making it the type species of the genus in which he also included two other mascarene birds only known from contemporary accounts the red rail and the réunion swamphen
as the name apterornis had already been used for a different bird by richard owen and the other former names were likewise invalid bonaparte coined the new binomial ornithaptera borbonica in <year> bourbon was the original french name for réunion
in <year> hermann schlegel placed the solitaire in the same genus as the dodo and named it didus apterornis
he restored it strictly according to contemporary accounts which resulted in an ibis or stork @-@ like bird instead of a dodo
as it was considered congeneric with the dodo the réunion solitaire was long believed to also be a member of the dididae family of pigeons
in <year> william coker announced the discovery of a <num> @-@ century persian painting of a white dodo among waterfowl which he had been shown in england
the artist was later identified as pieter withoos and many prominent <num> @-@ century naturalists subsequently assumed the image depicted the white solitaire of réunion a possibility originally proposed by ornithologist john gould
simultaneously several similar paintings of white dodos by pieter holsteyn ii were discovered in the netherlands
in <year> the english ornithologist alfred newton argued that the withoos painting and engraving in bontekoe 's memoir depicted a living réunion dodo that had been brought to holland while explaining its blunt beak as a result of beak trimming to prevent it from injuring humans
he also brushed aside the inconsistencies between the illustrations and descriptions especially the long thin beak implied by one contemporary account
newton 's words particularly cemented the validity of this connection among contemporary peers and several of them expanded on his views
dutch zoologist anthonie cornelis oudemans suggested that the discrepancies between the paintings and the old descriptions were due to the paintings showing a female and that the species was therefore sexually dimorphic
walter rothschild claimed the yellow wings might have been due to albinism in this particular specimen since the old descriptions described these as black
by the early <num> century many other paintings and even physical remains were claimed to be white dodos amid much speculation
some believed the solitaire of the old descriptions was rather a species similar to the rodrigues solitaire
rothschild commissioned british artist frederick william frohawk to restore the réunion solitaire as both a white dodo based on the withoos painting and as a distinct bird based on dubois description for his <year> book extinct birds
in <year> the japanese writer masauji hachisuka went as far as referring to the white dodos of the paintings as victoriornis imperialis and the solitaire of the accounts as ornithaptera solitarius
they cautioned that no conclusions could be made without solid evidence such as fossils and that nothing indicated that the white dodos in the paintings had anything to do with réunion
in <year> robert w
storer predicted that if any such remains were found they would not belong to raphinae or even columbidae
the first subfossil bird remains on réunion were found in <year> and assigned to a stork ciconia sp
the remains were found in a cave which indicated it had been brought there and eaten by early settlers
it was speculated that the remains could have belonged to a large mysterious bird described by leguat and called leguat 's giant by some ornithologists
leguat 's giant is now thought to be based on a locally extinct population of flamingos
in <year> subfossils of a recently extinct species of ibis from réunion were described as borbonibis latipes and thought related to the bald ibises of the genus geronticus
in <year> the stork remains were shown to belong to this ibis as well
the <year> discovery led biologist anthony s
cheke to suggest to one of the describers francois moutou that the subfossils may have been of the réunion solitaire
this suggestion was published by the describers of borbonibis in <year> and they also reassigned it to the genus threskiornis now combined with the specific epithet solitarius from de sélys @-@ longchamps <year> binomial for the solitaire
the authors pointed out that the contemporary descriptions matched the appearance and behaviour of an ibis more than a member of the raphinae especially since a fragment of a comparatively short and straight ibis mandible was discovered in <year> and because ibis remains were abundant in some localities it would be strange if contemporary writers never mentioned such a relatively common bird whereas they mentioned most other species subsequently known from fossils
the possible origin of the <num> @-@ century white dodo paintings has also recently been examined by biologist arturo valledor de lozoya in <year> and independently by experts of mascarene fauna anthony cheke and julian hume in <year>
the withoos and holsteyn paintings are clearly derived from each other and withoos likely copied his dodo from one of holsteyn 's works since these were probably produced at an earlier date
all later white dodo pictures are thought to be based on these paintings
according to the aforementioned writers it appears these pictures were themselves derived from a whitish dodo in a previously unreported painting containing called landscape with orpheus and the animals produced by roelant savery c
<year>
the dodo was apparently based on a stuffed specimen then in prague a walghvogel old dutch for dodo described as having a dirty off @-@ white colouring was mentioned in an inventory of specimens in the prague collection of the holy roman emperor rudolf ii to whom savery was contracted at the time <year> – <year>
savery 's several later dodo images all show greyish birds possibly because he had by then seen a normal specimen
cheke and hume concluded the painted specimen was white due to albinism and that this peculiar feature was the reason it was collected from mauritius and brought to europe
valledor de lozoya instead suggested that the light plumage was a juvenile trait a result of bleaching of old taxidermy specimens or simply due to artistic license
no fossil remains of dodo @-@ like birds have ever been found on réunion
a few later sources take issue with the proposed ibis @-@ identity of the solitaire and have even regarded the white dodo as a valid species
british writer errol fuller agrees that the <num> @-@ century paintings do not depict réunion birds but has questioned whether the ibis subfossils are necessarily connected to the solitaire accounts
he notes that no evidence indicates the extinct ibis survived until the time europeans reached réunion
cheke and hume have dismissed such sentiments as being mere belief and hope in the existence of a dodo on the island
therefore it is unlikely that réunion could have been colonised by flightless birds from these islands and only flighted species on the island have relatives there
three million years is enough time for flightless and weak flying abilities to have evolved in bird species on réunion itself
but such species would have been wiped out by the eruption of the volcano piton des neiges between <num> @,@ <num> and <num> @,@ <num> years ago
most recent species would therefore likely be descendants of animals which had recolonised the island from africa or madagascar after this event which is not enough time for a bird to become flightless
in <year> morphological study suggested the closest extant relatives of the réunion ibis are the african sacred ibis t
aethiopicus of africa and the straw @-@ necked ibis t
spinicollis of australia
it has also been suggested that it was closest to the malagasy sacred ibis t
bernieri and therefore of ultimately african origin
sieur dubois <year> account is the most detailed contemporary description of the bird here as translated by hugh strickland in <year> solitaires
these birds are so called because they always go alone
they are the size of a large goose and are white with the tips of the wings and tail black
the tail feathers resemble those of an ostrich the neck is long and the beak is like that of a woodcock but larger the legs and feet like those of turkeys
this bird has recourse to running as it flies but very little
the plumage colouration mentioned is similar to that of the related african sacred ibis and straw @-@ necked ibis which are also mainly white and glossy black
in the reproductive season the ornamental feathers on the back and wing tips of the african sacred ibis look similar to the feathers of an ostrich which echoes dubois description
likewise a subfossil lower jaw found in <year> showed that the bill of the réunion ibis was relatively short and straight for an ibis which corresponds with dubois woodcock comparison
cheke and hume have suggested that the french word bécasse from dubois original description usually translated to woodcock could also mean oystercatcher another bird with a long straight but slightly more robust bill
they have also pointed out that the last sentence is mistranslated and actually means the bird could be caught by running after it
the bright colouration of the plumage mentioned by some authors may refer to iridescence as seen in the straw @-@ necked ibis
subfossils of the réunion ibis show that it was more robust likely much heavier and had a larger head than the african sacred and straw @-@ necked ibises
it was nonetheless similar to them in most features
rough protuberances on the wing bones of the réunion ibis are similar to those of birds that use their wings in combat
it was perhaps flightless but this has not left significant osteological traces no complete skeletons have been collected but of the known pectoral elements only one feature indicates reduction in flight capability
the coracoid is elongated and the radius and ulna are robust as in flighted birds but a particular foramen between a metacarpal and the alular is otherwise only known from flightless birds such as some ratites penguins and several extinct species
as contemporary accounts are inconsistent on whether the solitaire was flightless or had some flight capability mourer @-@ chauvire suggested that this was dependent on seasonal fat @-@ cycles meaning that individuals fattened themselves during cool seasons but were slim during hot seasons perhaps it could not fly when it was fat but could when it was not
however dubois specifically stated the solitaires did not have fat @-@ cycles unlike most other réunion birds
it has been proposed that this is because the ancestors of the bird colonised réunion before swamps had developed and had therefore become adapted to the available habitats
they were perhaps prevented from colonising mauritius as well due to the presence of red rails there which may have occupied a similar niche
it appears to have lived in high altitudes and perhaps had a limited distribution
the only mention of its diet and exact habitat is jean feuilley 's account from <year> which is also the last record of a living individual the solitaires are the size of an average turkey cock grey and white in colour
they inhabit the tops of mountains
their food is only worms and filth taken on or in the soil
the diet and mode of foraging described by feuilley matches that of an ibis whereas members of the raphinae are known to have been fruit eaters
accounts by early visitors indicate the species was found near their landing sites but they were found only in remote places by <year>
the bird may have survived in eastern lowlands until the <num>
though many late <num> century accounts state the bird was good food feuilley stated it tasted bad
this may be because it changed its diet when it moved to more rugged higher terrain to escape pigs that destroyed its nests since it had limited flight capabilities it probably nested on the ground
many other endemic species of réunion became extinct after the arrival of man and the resulting disruption of the island 's ecosystem
the réunion ibis lived alongside other recently extinct birds such as the hoopoe starling the mascarene parrot the réunion parakeet the réunion swamphen the réunion owl the réunion night heron and the réunion pink pigeon
extinct reptiles include the réunion giant tortoise and an undescribed leiolopisma skink
the small mauritian flying fox and the snail tropidophora carinata lived on réunion and mauritius but vanished from both islands
introduced predators such as cats and rats took a toll
overhunting also contributed and several contemporary accounts state the bird was widely hunted for food
in <year> john tatton described the tameness of the bird and how easy it was to hunt as well as the large quantity consumed there is store of land fowle both small and great plenty of doves great parrats and such like and a great fowle of the bignesse of a turkie very fat and so short winged that they cannot fly being white and in a manner tame and so be all other fowles as having not been troubled nor feared with shot
our men did beat them down with sticks and stones
ten men may take fowle enough to serve fortie men a day
in <year> melet mentioned the culinary quality of this species and described the slaughter of several types of birds on the island a nother sort of bird called solitaires which are very good to eat and the beauty of their plumage is most fascinating for the diversity of bright colours that shine on their wing and around their necks
there are birds in such great confusion and so tame that it is not necessary to go hunting with firearms they can so easily be killed with a little stick or rod
during the five or six days that we were allowed to go into the woods so many were killed that our general de la haye was constrained to forbid anyone going beyond a hundred paces from the camp for fear the whole quarter would be destroyed for one needed only to catch one bird alive and make it cry out to have in a moment whole flocks coming to perch on people so that often without moving from one spot one could kill hundreds
but seeing that it would have been impossible to wipe out such a huge quantity permission was again given to kill which gave great joy to everyone because very good fare was had at no expense
the last definite account of the solitaire of réunion was feuilley 's from <year> indicating that the species probably became extinct sometime early in the century
in the <num> louis henri de freycinet asked an old slave about drontes old dutch word for dodo and was told the bird existed around saint @-@ joseph when his father was an infant
this would perhaps be a century earlier but the account may be unreliable
cheke and hume suspect that feral cats initially hunted wildlife in the lowlands and later turned to higher inland areas which were probably the last stronghold of the réunion ibis as they were unreachable by pigs
the species is thought to have been driven to extinction around <year> – <year>
the hnc was an unelected legislative @-@ style civilian advisory body they had created at the request of the united states — south vietnam 's main sponsor — to give a veneer of civilian rule
the dissolution dismayed the americans particularly the ambassador maxwell d
taylor who engaged in an angry war of words with various generals including khánh and threatened aid cuts
they were unable to do anything about the fait accompli that had been handed to them because they strongly desired to win the vietnam war and needed to support the army of the republic of vietnam
instead taylor 's searing verbal attacks were counterproductive as they galvanized the vietnamese officers around the embattled khánh
at the time khánh 's leadership was under threat from his fellow generals as well as taylor who had fallen out with him and was seeking his removal
the genesis of the removal of the hnc was a power struggle within the ruling junta
khánh who had been saved from an earlier coup attempt in september <year> by the intervention of some younger generals dubbed the young turks was indebted to them and needed to satisfy their wishes to stay in power
the young turks disliked a group of older officers who had been in high leadership positions but were now in powerless posts and wanted to sideline them completely
as a result they decided to hide their political motives by introducing a policy to compulsorily retire all general officers with more than <num> years of service
the chief of state phan khắc sửu an elderly figure appointed by the military to give a semblance of civilian rule did not want to sign the decree without the agreement of the hnc which mostly consisted of old men
the hnc recommended against the new policy and the younger officers led by i corps commander general nguyễn chánh thi and air marshal nguyễn cao kỳ disbanded the body and arrested some of its members along with other politicians
as a result of this event taylor summoned khánh to his office
khánh sent thi kỳ the commander of the republic of vietnam navy admiral chung tấn cang and iv corps commander general nguyễn văn thiệu and after beginning with do all of you understand english taylor harshly berated them and threatened cuts in aid
while angered by taylor 's manner the officers defended themselves in a restrained way
the next day khánh met taylor and the vietnamese leader made oblique accusations that the u
s
wanted a puppet ally he also criticized taylor for his manner the previous day
when taylor told khánh he had lost confidence in his leadership taylor was threatened with expulsion to which he responded with threats of total aid cuts
later however khánh said he would leave vietnam along with some other generals he named and during a phone conversation asked taylor to help with travel arrangements
he then asked taylor to repeat the names of the would @-@ be exiles for confirmation and taylor complied not knowing that khánh was taping the dialogue
khánh then showed the tape to his colleagues out of context misleading them into thinking that taylor wanted them expelled from their own country to raise the prestige of his embattled leadership
over the next few days khánh embarked on a media offensive repeatedly criticizing u
s
policy and decrying what he saw as an undue influence and infringement on vietnamese sovereignty explicitly condemning taylor and declaring the nation 's independence from foreign manipulation
khánh and the young turks began preparations to expel taylor before changing their minds however khánh 's misleading tactics had rallied the young turks around his fragile leadership for at least the short @-@ term future
the americans were forced to back down on their insistence that the hnc be restored and did not carry through on taylor 's threats to cut off aid despite saigon 's defiance
this came after lobbying by american officials — led by ambassador maxwell taylor — in vietnam as they placed great value in the appearance of civilian legitimacy which they saw as vital to building a popular base for any government
khánh put his rival general dương văn minh — who he had deposed in a january <year> coup — in charge of picking the <num> members of the hnc and minh filled it with figures sympathetic to him
the hnc then made a resolution to recommend a political model with a powerful head of state which would likely be minh given their sympathy towards him
khánh did not want his rival taking power so he and the americans convinced the hnc to dilute the powers of the position to make it unappealing to minh who was then sent on an overseas diplomatic goodwill tour to remove him from the political scene
however minh was back in south vietnam after a few months and the power balance in the junta was still fragile
the hnc which had representatives from a wide range of social groups selected the aging civilian politician phan khắc sửu as chief of state and suu chose trần văn hương as prime minister a position that had greater power
however khánh and the senior generals retained the real power
at the same time a group of catholic officers were trying to replace khánh with their co @-@ religionist general nguyễn văn thiệu and the incumbent was under pressure
during <year> south vietnam had suffered a succession of setbacks on the battlefield in part due to disunity in the military and a focus on coup plotting
in the meantime both saigon and washington were planning a large @-@ scale bombing campaign against north vietnam in an attempt to deter communist aggression but were waiting for stability in the south before starting the air strikes
most of the older officers had more experience under the vietnamese national army during the french colonial era and some of the younger men saw them as too detached from the modern situation
the young turks had quite a lot of influence over khánh as thi and kỳ had intervened militarily to save him from a coup attempt in september by generals lâm văn phát and dương văn đức
one of the specific and unspoken aims of this proposed policy was to remove generals minh trần văn đôn lê văn kim and mai hữu xuân from the military
this quartet along with tôn thất đính had been the leading members of a junta that overthrew president ngô đình diệm in november <year>
the generals who deposed diệm did not trust khánh because of his habit of changing sides and khánh was angered by their snubs
khánh put don kim xuan and dinh under arrest in da lat after his january coup claiming they were about to make a deal with the communists a falsehood to cover up his motive of revenge
these four thus became known as the da lat generals
khánh later released them and placed them into meaningless desk jobs with no work to do although they were still being paid
khánh did this as he thought the young turks had become too powerful and he hoped to use the da lat generals as a counterweight
all this time minh had been allowed to continue as a figurehead chief of state due to his popularity but khánh was intent on sidelining him too
the young turks were fully aware of khánh 's motives for rehabilitating the da lat generals and wanted to marginalize them
in public khánh and the young turks claimed the da lat generals and minh who had returned from his overseas tour had been making plots with the buddhist activists to regain power
suu 's signature was required to pass the ruling but he referred the matter to the hnc to get their opinion
the hnc turned down the request
there was speculation the hnc did this as many of them were old and therefore did not appreciate the generals negativity towards seniors — some south vietnamese mockingly called the hnc the high national museum
on december <num> a saturday the generals moved to dissolve the hnc by arresting some of its members
the hnc had already ceased to function in any meaningful way as only <num> of the <num> members were still occasionally attending its meetings and few on a regular basis
the operation was commanded by thi — who had travelled into saigon from i corps in the far north — and kỳ
the national police which was under the control of the army moved through the streets arresting five hnc members other politicians and student leaders they deemed to be an obstacle to their aims
minh and the other aging generals were arrested and flown to pleiku a central highlands town in a montagnard area while other officers were simply imprisoned in saigon
the junta 's forces also arrested around <num> members of the national salvation council nsc of le khac quyen the nsc was a new party active in central vietnam in the i corps region and opposed to the expansion of the war
it was aligned with thi and the buddhist activist monk thích trí quang but as thi was active in the purge it was believed he had fallen out with quyen
at this point khánh had not spoken up and allowed the impression that the moves had been made without his consultation or against his will and an attempt on the part of other officers to take power themselves
hương had actually privately endorsed the dissolution of the hnc as both he and the young turks thought it would allow them to gain more power and influence over khánh
the infighting exasperated taylor the us ambassador to south vietnam and former chairman of the us joint chiefs of staff who felt the disputes between the junta 's senior officers were derailing the war effort
only a few days earlier general william westmoreland — the commander of us forces in vietnam — had invited him and the vietnamese generals home to a dinner
there taylor asked for an end to the persistent changes in leadership and khánh and his men assured him of stability
westmoreland warned that persistent instability would turn the american political class and public against saigon as they would deem it useless to support such a regime
taylor initially cabled the state department back in the us to state a naked military fist had crumpled the carefully woven fabric of civilian government and that the arrest of the civilians would be immediately and understandably interpreted by all the world as another military coup setting back all that had been accomplished since the formation of the hnc and the creation of a veneer of civilian rule
he went on to say that an inescapable conclusion that if a group of military officers could issue decisions abolishing one of the three fundamental organs of the governmental structure
and carry out military arrests of civilians that group of military officers has clearly set themselves above and beyond the structure of government in vietnam
taylor bemoaned the fact that the generals had shown no second thoughts about ignoring us policy recommendations particularly in disregarding his explicit advice to maintain stable civilian rule at least at a nominal level
taylor issued a thinly disguised threat to cut aid releasing a public statement saying washington might reconsider its military funding if the fabric of legal government was not reinstated
taylor asked the four to sit down and then said do all of you understand english the ambassador then angrily denounced the officers
according to stanley karnow taylor launched into a tirade scolding them as if he were still superintendent of west point and they a group of cadets caught cheating
he said i told you all clearly at general westmoreland 's dinner we americans were tired of coups
apparently i wasted my words
he decried the removal of the hnc as totally illegal and said it had destroyed the government @-@ making process and that i made it clear that all the military plans i know you would like to carry out are dependent on government stability something he felt had been lost with the dismissal of the hnc
he said
you have made a real mess
we cannot carry you forever if you do things like this
taylor believed the hnc to be an essential part of the government because as an american he believed civilian legitimacy was a must
for him the hnc was a necessary step in a progression towards an elected civilian legislature which he regarded as critical for national and military morale
the historian mark moyar regarded taylor 's intervention as unnecessary and noted that there had been many instances of fierce fighting in vietnamese history despite the complete absence of democracy throughout the nation 's history
taylor also reminded them of an earlier meeting where he had discussed an american plan to expand the war increase funding for the south vietnamese military and to go on the offensive against the communists at the request of khánh
taylor said the americans would not be able to help saigon pursue their desired military strategy if the political machinations did not stop
taylor said that if the military did not transfer some powers or advisory capacity back to the hnc or another civilian institution aid would be withheld and some planned military operations against the ho chi minh trail — which was being used to infiltrate communists into the south — would be suspended
the four officers were taken aback by taylor 's searing words and felt they had been humiliated
a decade after the incident kỳ described taylor as the sort of man who addressed people rather than talked to them referencing the confrontation
karnow said for the sake of their own pride they the vietnamese officers resented being treated in ways that reminded them of their almost total dependence on an alien power
how could they preserve a sense of sovereignty when taylor striving to push them into getting things done behaved like a viceroy however thi also took a perverse pleasure in riling taylor
he was seen by a cia officer soon after grinning
when asked why he was happy thi said because this is one of the happiest days of my life
today i told the american ambassador that he could not dictate to us
nevertheless taylor 's conduct had rankled the officers stirring their latent sense of nationalism and anti @-@ americanism khánh would exploit this to strengthen his fragile position in the junta
khánh 's quartet of delegates responded to taylor in a circumlocutory way
they remained calm and did not resort to direct confrontation
kỳ said the change was necessary as the political situation is worse than it ever was under diệm
kỳ explained that the situation mandated the dissolution of the council saying we know you want stability but you cannot have stability until you have unity
he claimed some hnc members were disseminating coup rumors and creating doubt among the population and that both military and civilian leaders regard the presence of these people in the high national council as divisive of the armed forces due to their influence
kỳ further accused some of the hnc members of being communist sympathizers and cowards who wanted to stop the military from strengthening
he promised to explain the decision at a media conference and vowed that he and his colleagues would return to purely military roles in the near future
thiệu added i do not see how our action has hurt the hương government
hương now has the full support of the army and has no worries from the high national council which we have eliminated
cang said it seems
we are being treated as though we were guilty
what we did was only for the good of the country
when taylor said the moves detracted from hương and suu 's powers the officers disagreed and said they supported the pair in full and that hương had approved of the hnc 's dissolution
taylor was unimpressed by the reassurances concluding with i don 't know whether we will continue to support you after this
you people have broken a lot of dishes and now we have to see how we can straighten out this mess
taylor 's deputy u
alexis johnson felt the discussion had become counterproductive and was increasing the problem
he suggested that should the generals feel unwilling to alter their position immediately they should refrain from actions that would preclude a later change of heart
he proposed they merely announce the removal of certain members of the hnc rather than the dissolution of the entire body hoping the hnc could be reconstituted with figures they deemed to be more satisfactory
the four officers did not give a clear answer to johnson 's idea indicating they had not made a concrete decision by saying the door is not closed
hương said he and suu had not been notified of the moves but agreed to step in and take over the body 's work
taylor nevertheless asked hương to publicly condemn the coup and call on the army to release those arrested
hương also said he would be willing to reorganize his administration to meet the wishes of the military and that retaining their support was essential in keeping a civilian government functional
taylor said the us did not agree with military rule as a principle and might reduce aid but hương was unmoved and said the vietnamese people take a more sentimental than legalistic approach and that the existence of civilian procedure and the hnc was much less pressing than the moral prestige of the leaders
american military advisers and intelligence officers who liaised with senior junta members found they were unconcerned with any possible legal ramifications of their actions
later despite taylor 's pleas to keep the dissolution of the hnc secret in the hope it would be reversed kỳ thi thiệu and cang called a media conference where they maintained the hnc had been dissolved in the nation 's best interests
the quartet vowed to stand firm and not renege on their decision
they also proclaimed their ongoing confidence for suu and hương
two days later khánh went public in support of the young turks coup against the hnc condemning the advisory body and asserting the army 's right to intervene if disputes and differences create a situation favorable to the common enemies communism and colonialism
the generals announced they had formed a new body called the armed forces council afc to succeed the current military revolutionary council and referred to the dissolution of the hnc as decision no
<num> of the afc
the american policymakers viewed the public moves by the vietnamese generals as throwing down the gauntlet and challenging their counsel
he complained about the dissolution of the hnc and said it did not accord with the values of the alliance and the loyalty washington expected of saigon
he added that the us could not cooperate with two governments at once a military regime that held power while a civilian body took the responsibility
khánh testily replied that vietnam was not a satellite of the us and compared the situation to the us support of the successful coup against diệm saying that loyalty was meant to be reciprocated
khánh had hinted that he felt the americans were about to have him deposed like diệm who was then assassinated but this rankled taylor who had argued against the regime change
taylor then bemoaned khánh saying he had lost confidence in the vietnamese officer recommending khánh resign and go into exile
he also said military supplies currently being shipped to vietnam would be withheld after arriving in saigon and that american help in planning and advising military operations would be suspended
khánh bristled and said you should keep to your place as ambassador
as ambassador it is really not appropriate for you to be dealing in this way with the commander @-@ in @-@ chief of the armed forces on a political matter nor was it appropriate for you to have summoned some of my generals to the embassy yesterday
he threatened to expel taylor who responded by saying a forced departure would mean the end of us support
however khánh later said he was open to the possibility of going abroad and asked taylor if he thought this would be good for the country to which the ambassador replied in the affirmative
khánh also said he took responsibility for his generals actions and expressed regret at what they had done
khánh then ended the meeting saying he would think about his future
later khánh phoned taylor from his office and expressed his desire to resign and go abroad along with several other generals asking for the americans to fund the travel costs
he then read taylor the list of generals for whom arrangements needed to be made and asked the ambassador to repeat the names for confirmation
taylor did so unaware khánh was taping the dialogue
afterwards khánh played the tape out of context to his colleagues giving them the impression taylor was calling for their expulsion from their own country
khánh then asked his colleagues to participate in a campaign of fomenting anti @-@ american street protests and to give the impression the country did not need washington 's aid
a cia informant reported the recent arguments with taylor had incensed the volatile thi so much that he had privately vowed to blow up everything and kill phan khắc sửu trần văn hương and nguyễn khánh and put an end to all this
then we will see what happens
he said it was better to live poor but proud as free citizens of an independent country rather than in ease and shame as slaves of the foreigners and communists
khánh pledged support for both hương and suu 's civilian rule and condemned colonialism in a thinly veiled reference to the us
khánh explicitly denounced taylor in an exclusive interview with beverly deepe published in the new york herald tribune on december <num> saying if taylor did not act more intelligently southeast asia would be lost and that the us could not expect to succeed by modelling south vietnam on american norms
khánh said taylor and the us would need to be more practical and not have a dream of having vietnam be an image of the united states because the way of life and people are entirely different
he added that taylor 's attitude during the last <num> hours — as far as my small head is concerned — has been beyond imagination
justifying the removal of the hnc khánh said they were exploited by counter @-@ revolutionary elements who placed partisan considerations above the homeland 's sacred interest
khánh also threatened to divulge the content of his discussion with taylor saying one day i hope to tell the vietnamese people and the american people about this
it is a pity because gen
taylor is not serving his country well
khánh had not divulged that angry discussions had occurred in private so deepe was unsure what had happened between taylor and khánh to provoke such an outburst
she contacted the us embassy to ask what the dispute was about
at first the americans defended taylor without referring to what the problem was stating ambassador taylor has undertaken no activities which can be considered improper in any way
all his activities are designed to serve the best interests of both vietnam and the united states
the state department issued a statement later in the day in more robust terms saying ambassador taylor has been acting throughout with the full support of the u
s
government
a duly constituted government exercising full power
without improper interference
is the essential condition for the successful prosecution of the effort to defeat the viet cong
the following day secretary of state dean rusk said aid would have to be cut as the programs being funded needed an effective government to be useful
taylor later responded by calling the generals actions an improper interference into the purview of civilian government
defying taylor earned khánh heightened approval among his junta colleagues as the ambassador 's actions were seen as an insult to the nation
on the night of december <num> khánh convinced his fellow officers to join him in lobbying hương to declare taylor persona non grata and expel him from south vietnam
they were confident hương could not reject them and side with a foreign power at the expense of the military that had installed him and made preparations to meet him the next day
khánh also told hương that if taylor was not ejected he and the other generals would hold a media conference and release detailed accounts of the ambassador 's confrontation with the quartet and his ultimatum to general khánh the day after
however someone in the junta was a cia informant and reported the incident allowing american officials to individually lobby the officers to change their stance
at the same time the americans informed hương if taylor was expelled us funding would stop
the next day the generals changed their mind and when they met hương at his office only asked him to formally denounce taylor 's behavior in his meetings with khánh and his quartet and to take appropriate measures to preserve the honor of all the vietnamese armed forces and to keep national prestige intact
on december <num> khánh issued a declaration of independence from foreign manipulation and condemned colonialism explicitly accusing taylor of abusing his power
at the time khánh was also secretly negotiating with the communists hoping to put together a peace deal so he could expel the americans from vietnam although this effort did not lead anywhere in the two months before he was forced out of power
for his part taylor privately told americans journalists that khánh was expressing opposition to the us merely because he knew he had lost washington 's confidence
taylor said khánh was completely unprincipled and was stirring up anti @-@ american sentiment purely to try to shore up his political prospects not because he thought us policy was harmful to south vietnam
the us media were generally very critical of khánh 's actions and did not blame taylor for the disharmony
peter grose of the new york times said it almost seems as if viet cong insurgents and the saigon government conspired to make the united states feel unwelcome
the chicago tribune lampooned khánh 's junta calling it a parody of a government and saying it would not survive for a week without us support and describing the generals as remittance men on the united states payroll
however the new york herald tribune said it was dangerous to pressure south vietnam too much citing the instability that followed the american support for the coup against diệm who had resisted us advice so often
it said the issue is not general khánh versus general taylor
it is whether the vietnamese still have the will to exist as an independent state
the newspaper said if the answer was yes then both washington and saigon would have to look beyond personalities
angry with deepe for airing khánh 's grievances against him taylor invited every other us journalist in saigon to this private briefing
taylor gave the journalists his account of the dispute and discussions with the generals and hoped it would be useful background information for the media so they would understand what he had done and not reach negative conclusions about his conduct in their writing
due to the sensitivity of the situation he asked them to keep the remarks off the record
however someone at the briefing informed deepe of what taylor had said and she published the remarks on december <num> under the title taylor rips mask off khánh
in this article comments were also attributed to taylor describing some south vietnamese officers as borderline nuts and accusing many generals of staying in saigon and allowing their junior officers to run the war as they saw fit
deepe 's article caused an uproar due to the tension between taylor and the vietnamese generals
and the possibility that this situation could lead to anti @-@ american activities of the unknown intensity request marine landing force now off cap varella be positioned out of sight of land off cap st
jacques soonest
better known as vũng tàu cap st
jacques was a coastal city at the mouth of the saigon river around <num> km southeast of the capital
westmoreland also put american marines based at subic bay in the philippines on notice
on the same day the viet cong bombed the brinks hotel where us officers were billeted killing two americans and injuring around <num> people civilian bystanders and military personnel
as a result there was a suspicion among a minority that khánh 's junta had been behind the attack even though the viet cong had claimed responsibility through a radio broadcast
when the americans started making plans to retaliate against north vietnam they did not tell khánh and his junta
westmoreland taylor and other senior us officers in saigon and washington urged president lyndon baines johnson to authorize reprisal bombings against north vietnam taylor predicting some of our local squabbles will probably disappear in enthusiasm which our action would generate
johnson refused and one reason was the political instability in saigon
johnson reasoned the international community and the american public were unlikely to believe the viet cong were behind the attack feeling they would instead blame local infighting for the violence
johnson administration officials did not conclude that the communists were responsible until four days after the attack
the state department cabled taylor saying in view of the overall confusion in saigon public us and international opinion towards an american air strike would be that the johnson administration was trying to shoot its way out of an internal south vietnamese political crisis
the us hoped the generals would relent because they could not survive and be able to repel the communists or rival officers without aid from washington
on the other hand khánh and the young turks expected the americans would become more worried about the communist gains first and acquiesce to their fait accompli against the hnc
the generals were correct
the south vietnamese eventually had their way
as the generals and hương were unwilling to reinstate the hnc taylor sent general john l
throckmorton to meet them and mend relations
throckmorton told the vietnamese generals they had read too much into taylor 's comments and that the us had no intention of pressuring them out of power with aid cuts
cang appeared unimpressed while thiệu and kỳ made indirect and vague comments about what they perceived to be misleading tactics during the talks
khánh appeared reassured by throckmorton 's overtures and made a public statement on december <num> saying he was not as hostile to the americans as reported and he wanted thiệu and cang to meet the americans to relieve any remaining tension
he also claimed privately that the statements attributed to him by deepe were false and set up a bilateral committee to discuss tensions
the generals eventually won out as the americans did not move against them in any way for their refusal to reinstate the hnc
the south vietnamese won in large part because the americans had spent so much on the country and could not afford to abandon it and lose to the communists over the matter of military rule as a communist takeover would be a big public relations coup for the soviet bloc
according to karnow for khánh and his officers their weakness was their strength
an anonymous south vietnamese government official said our big advantage over the americans is that they want to win the war more than we do
the only concession the afc made was on january <num> <year> when they made a charade move of officially renouncing all their power to hương who was asked to organize elections
they also agreed to appoint a civilian body and release those arrested in december
khánh had proposed to reinstate civilian rule if a military organ of control was created to keep control of them but taylor quashed the idea
this resulted in an official announcement by hương and khánh three days later in which the military again reiterated their commitment to civilian rule through an elected legislature and a new constitution and that all genuine patriots would be earnestly assembled to collaborate in making a plan to defeat the communists
the americans were not impressed with the statement which was shown to taylor before it was made public the state department dourly announced that it appears to represent some improvement to the situation
nevertheless khánh and taylor were both signatories to this january <num> announcement
although the coup was a political success for khánh it was not enough to stabilize his leadership in the long run
during the dispute over the hnc khánh had tried to frame the dispute in nationalistic terms against what he saw as overbearing us influence
in the long run this failed as south vietnam and the senior officers careers and advancement were dependent on us aid
taylor hoped khánh 's appeals to nationalism might backfire by causing his colleagues to fear a future without us funding
the americans were aware of khánh 's tactics and exploited it by persistently trying to scare his colleagues with the prospect of a military heavily restricted by the absence of us funding
after the december coup taylor felt the fear of us abandonment raised the courage level of the other generals to the point of sacking khánh as many were seen as beholden above all to their desire for personal advancement
in january and february <year> khánh sensed he could no longer work with taylor and the americans and that his support in the junta was unreliable so he began to try to set up secret peace talks with the communists
planning for discussions was only beginning but this was unacceptable to the americans and hardline anti @-@ communists in the junta as it meant the bombing campaign against north vietnam would not be possible
when khánh 's plans were discovered us @-@ encouraged plotting intensified
on february <num> – <num> a coup occurred and after the original plot was put down by the young turks they forced khánh into exile as well
with khánh out of the way the bombing campaign started
the game took place at wrigley field in chicago on september <num> <year>
the cubs won the game <num> – <num> holding the giants scoreless for the majority of the game until the giants threatened heavily in the ninth inning and scored all three of their runs
as a result of the game the cubs qualified for the postseason and the giants did not
the game was necessary after both teams finished the season with identical win – loss records of <num> – <num>
the cubs won a coin flip late in the season which by rule at the time awarded them home field for the game
this victory advanced the cubs to the <year> nl division series nlds where they were swept by the atlanta braves ending the cubs season
michael jordan a popular chicago sportsman then ending his career with the chicago bulls threw the game 's ceremonial first pitch
in baseball statistics the tie @-@ breaker counted as the <num> regular season game for both teams with all events in the game added to regular season statistics
the giants barry bonds drew criticism for his postseason performance which had been a recurring criticism dating back to his time with the pittsburgh pirates
the cubs made several offseason acquisitions following the <year> season including trading doug glanville for second baseman mickey morandini along with signing jeff blauser and henry rodríguez as free agents
one notable event of the <year> season was the race for the home run title and roger maris single @-@ season record of <num> home runs between the cubs sammy sosa and the cardinals mark mcgwire
mcgwire ultimately won setting a new record of <num> while sosa closed the season with <num>
bonds would top their totals with <num> home runs in <year> setting the current record while mcgwire and sosa 's totals remain the second and third highest figures in mlb history
additionally three teams finished the <year> season within one game of one another in the race for the national league wild card the cubs giants and new york mets
this late @-@ season race included a dramatic cubs loss to the brewers on september <num>
the cubs led <num> – <num> with two outs and the bases loaded for the brewers in the bottom of the ninth inning when brant brown dropped a fly ball allowing three unearned runs to score on his error and losing the cubs the game
this loss gained notoriety for announcer and former @-@ cub ron santo 's call of the final play yelling oh no as the final runs scored
the mets were tied with the cubs and giants in the wild @-@ card race as late in the season as september <num> at <num> – <num>
however the mets lost their remaining two games and finished their season one game back of the cubs and giants who ended tied at <num> – <num>
this record was also the best non @-@ division @-@ winning record and as such a tie @-@ breaker was necessary to determine the wild @-@ card winner
a coin flip on september <num> gave the cubs home field advantage setting wrigley field as the location for the game
in the event of a three @-@ way tie the cubs were presented with the choice to either host two home games or receive a bye and play the winner of a mets @-@ giants game on the road because they had the best combined record against the mets and giants
cubs general manager ed lynch decided on the second option though the choice was moot as the mets fell out of the race
the cubs steve trachsel and mark gardner of the giants were slated to start the tie @-@ breaker on the september <num>
m
ct at wrigley field in chicago the game remained scoreless in the early innings with only two baserunners apiece for each team through the first three innings
the giants loaded the bases with two outs in the top of the <num> inning but brian johnson struck out to end the inning
the first runs of the game came in the top of the <num> as henry rodriguez singled to lead off the inning and scored on a home run by gary gaetti to give the cubs a <num> – <num> lead
the cubs threatened again in the next inning with singles by lance johnson and sammy sosa
rich rodriguez relieved gardner but loaded the bases with a walk to mark grace and allowed a single to matt mieske which scored two more runs and extended the cubs lead to <num> – <num>
john johnstone relieved rodriguez and closed the inning without further scoring
after getting one out in the top of the <num> steve trachsel allowed a single and a walk to pinch hitters brent mayne and armando ríos respectively
the cubs double switched bringing in matt karchner to relieve trachsel and orlando merced to play left field
karchner induced another out before loading the bases on a single by shawon dunston
félix heredia entered in relief of karchner and got barry bonds to ground out to first base to end the inning
the cubs further extended their lead in the bottom of the <num> inning
after alvin morman got morandini to strike out to open the inning the giants double switched to bring in josé mesa to pitch and bill mueller at third base
mesa allowed a single to sammy sosa and a double to mark grace which advanced sosa to third
following a ground out mesa threw a wild pitch while facing gaetti and sosa scored to make the game <num> – <num>
the giants responded in the top of the <num> scoring their only runs of the game
kevin tapani allowed successive singles to brent mayne and mueller to open the inning before terry mulholland relieved him
stan javier singled to score mayne and ellis burks then walked to load the bases
bonds came to bat with the bases loaded for the second time in the game and lined out to deep right field scoring mueller on a sacrifice fly and javier advanced to third base
rod beck entered and got successive outs by jeff kent which scored javier and joe carter to end the game <num> – <num> for the cubs
the cubs presence in the postseason playing for a spot in the world series led several sportswriters to reference the curse of the billy goat and the difficulties the cubs had faced since <year>
the billy goat story suggests that billy sianis cursed the cubs after he and his goat were asked to leave game four of the <year> world series
the playoff berth matched the cubs with the atlanta braves in the nlds where the cubs were swept three games to none
the cubs have not made the world series since <year> and have not won a title since <year>
in baseball statistics tie @-@ breakers count as regular season games with all events in them added to regular season statistics
for example the chicago sun @-@ times noted that sammy sosa could have added to his notable home run total in the game
sosa did add to his league @-@ leading strikeout total with one in the <num> inning
beck also added to his league @-@ leading total in games played and earned his 51st save of the season which finished <num> to trevor hoffman 's <num> but is tied for the <num> highest single @-@ season save total in mlb history
several cubs and giants won awards for their regular season performances including rookie of the year honors for kerry wood a silver slugger award for sosa and a rawlings gold glove award for j
t
snow
sosa also won the most valuable player award earning <num> out of <num> first place votes with mcgwire taking the remaining <num>
barry bonds drew criticism after the game for his poor performance including twice making an out with the bases loaded with some suggesting that bonds often played poorly in big games
bonds <num> – <num> performance with an rbi and a strikeout earned him a −
<num> win probability added wpa the lowest figure for any player in the game
wpa is a statistic which takes the game situation into account to quantify how a player altered his team 's chances of winning
bonds figure translates into decreasing the giants chances of success by <num>
<num>
the book game of shadows which details bonds suggested use of performance @-@ enhancing drugs ped argues that bonds grew jealous and resentful of the attention mark mcgwire and sammy sosa were given during their record chase
as a result according to game of shadows bonds turned to weight training under greg anderson who began providing him with steroids and other peds following the <year> season

the bay is located approximately <num> miles <num> km south of san antonio and <num> miles <num> km southwest of houston
corpus christi bay has a rich history of human settlement along its shores that dates back millennia and is responsible for the growth of corpus christi and the smaller ports of ingleside and portland
it is an important natural estuary that supports a diverse collection of wildlife and attracts many tourists
the bay 's abundance of petroleum and natural gas has attracted industry and its strategic location on the texas coast is ideal for military establishment
archeological evidence suggests that pre @-@ karankawa peoples used the area near oso bay as a burial ground between <num> bc and <num> ad
it is believed to have first been spotted by europeans on corpus christi day <year> when spanish explorer alonso álvarez de pineda navigated its waters
joaquín de orobio y basterra came across the bay in <year> when given orders to settle the area between tampico mexico and the mouth of the san antonio river at san antonio bay
he named the bay after st
michael the archangel but the name did not stick and was referred to as corpus christi bay in a <year> report by diego ortiz parrilla
explorer blas maría de la garza falcón is believed to have been the first man to purchase land on the bay in <year>
shortly thereafter the short @-@ lived settlement of villa de vedoya was founded on the mouth of the nueces river

a bayfront that included a <num> @-@ foot overlooking statue of jesus christ was designed by mount rushmore sculptor gutzon borglum in <year> but was turned down by the city in <year>
later efforts to build a statue on the shore were also rejected
the bayside port would later grow into a major city and had a population of <num> @,@ <num> people during the <year> u
s
census
in addition to corpus christi kinney also found nuecestown known to settlers as the motts in <year> near the confluence of the nueces river and nueces bay
the town was attacked by mexican robbers in <year> and underwent a steep decline
it is now a ghost town located in the corpus christi city limits
the city of ingleside was founded on the northern shore of the bay in <year> and grew slowly
it had a population of <num> @,@ <num> in the <year> census
likewise the city of portland located on the northeastern bluff between the nueces and corpus christi bays did not grow as rapidly as corpus christi following its <year> founding
during the <year> census it had <num> @,@ <num> residents
for transportation on the bay steamboats were commonplace between corpus christi and ingleside during the <num>
native americans used a route made up of a series of shallow oyster beds dubbed reef road
the passage which was about <num> to <num> inches in depth could be navigated on foot or horseback during low tides to travel across the opening of nueces bay into corpus christi bay
white settlers discovered the road in the <num> and it became a common way to pass from portland to corpus christi via buggy although its jagged course had to be marked with posts and horses would sometimes fall off the beds and drown
a wooden causeway connecting portland and corpus christi was first constructed in <year> but was repeatedly rebuilt and destroyed by several storms
a permanent concrete bridge was erected in the <num> and a double lane was added in <year>
the approximately mile long structure is today known as the nueces bay causeway
the bay has been strategically important for the military
general zachary taylor stationed his men on rincon point during the mexican @-@ american war and a union invasion was halted by confederates on the same point in <year> during the american civil war
the port of corpus christi was used by the confederates to bring in supplies during the war effort until the union bombarded corpus christi and occupied the bay and port from <year> to <year>
in <year> the naval air station corpus christi was established on the bay and by <year> had transformed into a major base with one main air station and six additional stations
notably during a march <year> practice run from the base future senator john mccain lost track of his altitude and speed and his single @-@ seat single @-@ pistoned @-@ engine ad @-@ <num> skyraider crashed into corpus christi bay and sank to the bottom
he squeezed out of the cockpit swam ten feet to the surface and was carried to safety by a rescue helicopter therefore escaping without major injuries
the surrounding land is semi @-@ arid and is used for ranching and other agricultural purposes
the bay itself is considered subtropical and was described by gutzon borglum as the most beautiful bay on the texas coast
on average the system is <num> meters <num>

the exchange with the gulf of mexico occurs at aransas pass
as a result of the seawater exchange the bay 's salinity is <num> parts per thousand ppt which is lower than the seawater average of <num> ppt
following the shoreline beginning at naval air station corpus christi on the bay 's southeastern peninsula the features of the bay can be best described
moving northwest from the air station oso bay must be crossed at its confluence with corpus christi bay
on the other side of the meeting is ward island actually a peninsula where texas a m university – corpus christi is found
further northwest the shore begins to curve and off in the distance across the bay the skyline of corpus christi is visible
following the shore the land dips inward and forms emerald cove where a seawall has been constructed
out in the bay the alta vista reef can be spotted from this location
moving north along the shore the seawall continues into the main city until it reaches industrial canal which has been dredged south of nueces bay and extends into the main bay to port aransas
another seawall which starts in emerald cove with gaps at places such as a spoils island that can be viewed in the bay and the canal is slightly out in the water
this seawall ends when it reaches land at the southern portion of corpus christi beach
north of the canal corpus christi beach is found along the shore to rincon point where corpus christi bay opens to nueces bay and must be crossed using the nueces bay causeway to indian point near portland from where indian reef juts from offshore
past portland the shore curves to the southeast where the large la quinta island forms on the backdrop of industrial plants in ingleside
the la quinta channel has been dredged between the island and the shore and meets the jewell fulton canal at the confluence of kinney bayou
ingleside cove is formed in this area between la quinta island and an island named ingleside point
the shore then curves to the southwest where ingleside on the bay is located on southern shore of the bay 's northeastern peninsula

the <year> season officially started on may <num> in the eastern pacific and on june <num> in the central pacific and lasted until november <num>
these dates conventionally delimit the period of each year when most tropical cyclones form in the northeastern pacific ocean
however these bounds were slightly exceeded when hurricane alma formed on may <num>
hurricane alma became the third earliest tropical cyclone in the eastern pacific basin since the satellite era began in <year> while trudy is the third strongest october eastern pacific hurricane on record
overall the impact of this season was minimal
tropical storm rachel made two landfalls in mexico and brought rain to the united states
hurricane boris brought light showers to california
all of the tropical cyclones of this year developed from westward @-@ moving african tropical waves
the season established several tropical storm records for this basin and was marked by several strong hurricanes
there were <num> named tropical cyclones seven below the record established by the <year> pacific hurricane season two years later but four more than the long @-@ term average
sixteen of those named storms twice the average and four more than the previous record reached hurricane intensity
only cristina douglas aka rachel and simon did not reach hurricane strength
six of those hurricanes reached category <num> intensity or higher on the saffir @-@ simpson hurricane scale
hurricanes hernan and trudy were among the strongest ever observed in this area
alma became the earliest named tropical cyclone for the eastern pacific ocean east of the <num> meridian west
the eastern pacific produced four tropical depressions that did not reach tropical storm status
with the exception of marie and polo these systems developed between <num> ° and <num> ° n east of the longitude of baja california in the climatologically favored area for tropical cyclogenesis
after their development most of the tropical cyclones moved on a west to northwest track and dissipated over cool waters without affecting land
rachel was the only system to make landfall
in addition one tropical storm formed in the central pacific and eventually crossed the international dateline before dissipating
it then moved across the atlantic crossed northern south america and entered the pacific ocean on may <num>
convection started to increase with the wave just to the south of panama
the wave moved westward and continued to become better organized over the next few days
on may <num> the wave had become organized enough and was designated tropical depression one @-@ e
tropical depression one @-@ e moved slowly to the northwest while strengthening slowly due to easterly vertical wind shear
the depression was upgraded to tropical storm alma on may <num>
the storm quickly strengthened once the vertical wind shear relaxed and was near hurricane force by the morning of may <num>
hurricane alma reached its peak intensity early on may <num> with maximum sustained winds of <num> mph <num> km h
the hurricane entered an area of southwesterly wind shear caused by an upper @-@ level ridge of high pressure
the increasing vertical wind shear and cooler water caused alma to weaken to a tropical storm
on may <num> the storm continued to weaken and became a depression
the next day the system dissipated as a tropical cyclone well west of mainland mexico
alma became the earliest named storm and hurricane in the satellite era in the east pacific proper
the wave did not significantly develop as it moved west across the atlantic ocean and caribbean sea
once it crossed central america into the eastern pacific ocean cloudiness increased considerably with the system on may <num>
it became well @-@ enough organized to be upgraded to tropical depression two @-@ e on june <num>
after becoming a depression the system moved to the west @-@ northwestward
upper @-@ level easterly vertical wind shear limited the amount of the initial strengthening
however an increase in convective banding led to its upgrade to tropical storm boris on june <num> <num> mi <num> km southwest of manzanillo
further strengthening occurred due to an anticyclone aloft fostered additional development and by june <num> boris became a hurricane
the hurricane began to move to the north @-@ northwest in response to a trough off of the west coast of the united states
strengthening continued and the storm reached its peak strength with winds of <num> mph <num> km h and a minimum central pressure of <num> mb <num>
<num> inhg
the hurricane 's cloud pattern became elongated along a southwest @-@ northeast axis on june <num> due to an increased amount of vertical wind shear
boris was downgraded to a tropical storm later in the day on june <num>
the deep convection of the tropical storm decreased as boris moved over cooler waters
it was downgraded to a tropical depression on june <num> due to these factors
the depression dissipated as a tropical cyclone on june <num> as the system quickly lost its tropical characteristics
a small circulation remained in the cloud field offshore the northwest coast of baja california for a few more days
the winds in the eyewall of boris ripped off the sails of the azure dream sailboat
outer rainbands from the storm produced moderate rain in several mexican states
in mexico rainfall peaked at <num>
<num> in <num> mm near san lucas michoacán
the remnants of boris also brought sporadic rainfall over the western united states with precipitation being reported in arizona california colorado nevada and wyoming
the remnants of boris were responsible for causing the wettest june in san diego since records began in <year> however not even <num> in <num> mm of rain fell at that location
rainfall from the remnant system in the united states peaked at <num>
<num> in <num> mm over the santa rita mountains
no other direct damages or casualties were reported from boris
the wave moved across central america into the northeastern pacific ocean where convection organized with the system on june <num>
the system became well @-@ enough organized to be upgraded to tropical depression three @-@ e on june <num> while <num> mi <num> @,@ <num> km south of the southern tip of baja california
the depression continued to strengthen and was upgraded to tropical storm cristina on june <num>
cristina initially had well @-@ established upper @-@ level outflow
it failed to reach hurricane status peaking with maximum sustained winds of <num> mph <num> km h due to movement of its associated upper @-@ level anticyclone to the north over mexico which caused cristina to be exposed to easterly vertical wind shear
cristina moved generally northwestward which eventually placed the storm in cooler waters and caused the deep convection of the system to dissipate
on june <num> cristina diminished to a tropical depression
cristina moved west @-@ northwestward with the low @-@ level flow
the depression dissipated as a tropical cyclone on june <num> after a lack of deep convection for <num> hours
it continued westward across the tropical north atlantic and caribbean sea without significant development
the wave entered the northeastern pacific ocean on june <num> where it generated an area of increased cloudiness
organization of thunderstorm activity increased late on june <num> and early on june <num>
tropical depression four @-@ e formed on june <num> when it was <num> mi <num> km south of acapulco mexico after evidence of low @-@ level circulation for the past <num> hours
the depression moved in a west @-@ northwest direction due to a subtropical ridge north of the depression
satellite analysis indicated that the depression had reached tropical storm force strength and it was upgraded to tropical storm douglas on june <num> while <num> mi <num> km southwest of acapulco
douglas reached peak strength of <num> mph <num> km h on june <num> a tropical storm warning was issued on june <num> from punta tejupan to cabo corrientes before being discontinued on june <num>
tropical storm douglas brushed the western coast of mexico
the center of circulation approached within <num> mi <num> km of the coast of mexico on june <num>
douglas then began to weaken because of interaction with the mountainous terrain of mexico
the system continued to weaken despite warm water temperatures and favorable upper @-@ level conditions
douglas dissipated early on june <num> while <num> mi <num> km south @-@ southeast off the southern tip of baja california
the highest rainfall report from mexico from douglas totaled <num>
<num> in <num> mm at la huerta
no deaths or damage were reported
the system moved across the atlantic and entered into the northeastern pacific ocean
the wave became a significant tropical system with cyclonic turning in the lower and middle layers of the system 's cloudiness on june <num>
the center of circulation was located <num> mi <num> km south of acapulco mexico
the system exhibited sufficient organization to be considered tropical depression five @-@ e on june <num>
the depression quickly strengthened and became tropical storm elida later that day
the track of elida was west @-@ northwestward to northwestward from june <num> through june <num>
some rainbands moved over the mountainous region of southwestern mexico but no flooding damage or casualties were reported as a result
elida continued strengthening and it was upgraded to a hurricane early on june <num> passing directly over socorro island later in the day right as elida reached peak strength of <num> mph <num> km h dropping <num>
<num> in <num> mm of rain on the island
some windows broke also as a result and minor structural damage was reported as a result on the island
a high @-@ pressure area to the north forced elida to move more westward on june <num>
convection began to decrease in the hurricane as it moved into cooler waters and it weakened to a tropical storm later in the day
it then weakened to a tropical depression on july <num> and dissipated on july <num>
originally the system was expected to reach tropical storm strength and near hurricane intensity by late on july <num> or early on july <num> however persistent vertical wind shear over the system impeded its development
after convection began to merge into the intertropical convergence zone itcz the national hurricane center discontinued advisories on tropical depression six @-@ e stating that the depression dissipated and regeneration seemed unlikely
however wind shear began to decrease and convection associated with the remnants of tropical depression six @-@ e quickly began to increase
although the low @-@ level circulation was near the edge of the deep convection the national hurricane center resumed advisories on tropical depression six @-@ e by july <num>
intensification into a tropical storm was again predicted but tropical depression six @-@ e remained poorly defined and eventually dissipated on july <num>
the wave crossed the atlantic ocean and caribbean sea into the warm waters of the northeastern pacific ocean on july <num>
an area of disturbed weather moved northwards towards the gulf of tehuantepec and became tropical depression seven @-@ e early on july <num>
the depression moved northwest and because of increased organization of deep convection was designated tropical storm fausto on july <num> <num> mi <num> km south of manzanillo mexico
a weakly defined eye formed on july <num> and the storm was upgraded to hurricane fausto <num> mi <num> km south of cabo san lucas
fausto peaked in strength with winds of <num> mph <num> km h and a central pressure of <num> mb <num>
<num> inhg on july <num>
fausto passed <num> mi <num> km north of socorro island causing a northwest wind of <num> mph <num> km h and <num>
<num> in <num> mm of rain at that location
the hurricane fluctuated in intensity on july <num> before weakening into a tropical storm later that day <num> mi <num> km west of cabo san lucas
the weakening fausto moved over continuing cooler waters and was downgraded to a tropical depression on june <num> <num> mi <num> @,@ <num> km west of cabo san lucas
the depression dissipated as a tropical cyclone on june <num> and its low level circulation of clouds persisted for a few days
within the western caribbean sea convection developed with the wave on july <num>
the system became better organized as it moved into the northeastern pacific ocean
the system was upgraded to tropical depression eight @-@ e on july <num>
the depression moved west @-@ northwest with a good outflow to the north and gradually strengthened into tropical storm genevieve later that day
genevieve continued to strengthen reaching hurricane strength on july <num>
the storm approached within <num> mi <num> km of socorro island where a sustained wind of <num> mph <num> km h and gust of <num> mph <num> km h were reported before the weather equipment on the island failed
the hurricane began to turn west because of the strengthening and growing ridge to its north
increasing outflow aloft began to form and the hurricane reached its peak strength of <num> mph <num> km h with a well @-@ defined eye at its center of circulation
genevieve turned northwest on july <num> into an area with strong vertical wind shear and low water temperatures
the hurricane quickly weakened into a tropical storm on july <num> and then into a tropical depression on july <num>
genevieve dissipated as a tropical cyclone later in the day reduced to a circulation in the stratocumulus cloud field
the wave moved across central america into the northeastern pacific ocean on july <num>
thunderstorm activity increased in the system between july <num> and <num> before rainbands became present within the tropical disturbance on july <num>
tropical depression nine @-@ e formed later that day while <num> mi <num> km southwest of acapulco mexico
tropical depression nine @-@ e strengthened into tropical storm hernan on july <num> while <num> mi <num> @,@ <num> km south of cabo san lucas
the tropical storm continued to strengthen and as it moved to the northwest and became a hurricane late on july <num>
hernan continued to strengthen and as it passed <num> mi <num> km southwest of clarion island
on july <num> hernan reached its peak strength of <num> mph <num> km h and minimum pressure of <num> mb <num>
<num> inhg as the center of circulation was <num> mi <num> km south @-@ southwest of clarion island
on july <num> concentric eyewalls one eyewall located inside another formed around the center of hernan which was the first time this pattern had been observed with an eastern pacific hurricane
hernan kept category <num> hurricane intensity a few more days and hurricane strength for six days overall
the hurricane weakened into a tropical storm on july <num> as it moved over cooler waters
hernan turned more to the west as its low level center became separated from its thunderstorm activity and was steering by a surface high @-@ pressure system to its north
hernan moved over cooler waters dissipating as a tropical cyclone early on july <num>
the wave moved west but it was not until it moved across the caribbean sea that the wave 's convection organized
the system entered into the northeastern pacific ocean with concentrated convection and a surface center of circulation while southeast of acapulco
moving west @-@ northwest tropical depression ten @-@ e formed on july <num> <num> mi <num> km south of puerto ángel mexico
early on the following day the depression strengthened into tropical storm iselle
the storm continued strengthening while in the proximity of hurricane hernan becoming a hurricane on july <num>
the hurricane continued to move west @-@ northwest through its duration and reached its peak strength of <num> mph <num> km h on july <num>
iselle crossed socorro island which recorded a <num> mph <num> km h sustained wind and heavy rain on july <num>
the hurricane weakened on following days after it moved over cooler waters downgraded to a tropical storm on july <num> and subsequently into a tropical depression on july <num>
the depression dissipated later that day after losing its low @-@ level circulation <num> mi <num> km southwest of san diego
due to the close proximity of hernan to its west the development of the depression was hindered due to vertical wind shear from the outflow of hernan
this wind shear dissipated the depression on july <num> and its remnants were absorbed by the nearby cyclone
no damages or casualties were caused by the depression as it was well out to sea
an area of disturbed weather began to organize on august <num>
by august <num> the system became well @-@ enough organized to become designated tropical depression one @-@ c
the depression intensified into a tropical storm while moving west to the south of the hawaiian islands
on august <num> tropical storm aka peaked with maximum sustained winds of <num> mph <num> km h
the storm continued to move west and approached johnston island though the island 's weather did not deteriorate
the tropical storm crossed the international date line on august <num>
aka weakened back into a depression and dissipated two days later on august <num>
although tropical depression diana entered the eastern pacific the national hurricane center did not re @-@ classify the system
no re @-@ intensification occurred after the system entered the eastern pacific and it had dissipated as a tropical cyclone by the following day
the remnant tropical disturbance recurved through the gulf of california while developing significant convection before it moved into northwest mexico which brought rainfall amounts of over <num> in <num> mm to local areas within the state of sonora
the remnant disturbance moved into the american southwest on august <num>
the depression developed from a tropical disturbance well southeast of hawaii which became much better organized on the night of august <num>
the tropical depression moved in a west northwest direction for the next <num> hours and then changed to a west @-@ southwest track on august <num>
as it turned more to the southwest the depression weakened until it dissipated on august <num> about <num> mi <num> km south @-@ southeast of hilo hawaii
moving northwest the system developed slowly as it was embedded within the intertropical convergence zone
easterly shear kept the system from reaching tropical storm strength and caused its ultimate dissipation on august <num>
no damages or fatalities were caused by this depression
the system entered the northeastern pacific ocean and became well @-@ enough organized to be upgraded to tropical depression thirteen @-@ e on august <num> while centered <num> mi <num> km south of acapulco mexico
the depression moved on a west @-@ northwestward track and strengthened becoming tropical storm julio on august <num>
strengthening continued and julio reached hurricane strength on august <num>
the cyclone peaked with maximum sustained winds of <num> mph <num> km h on august <num>
the storm turned westward and began weakening
julio regained tropical storm status on august <num> and tropical depression status on august <num> before dissipating as a tropical cyclone later that day
no damage was reported from julio
while fran dissipated shortly after that the tropical wave progressed into the northeastern pacific ocean
the wave spawned tropical depression fourteen @-@ e <num> mi <num> @,@ <num> km east @-@ southeast of hurricane julio
the depression moved westward for the next several days
as julio weakened the depression began to increase in strength
it became tropical storm kenna on august <num> and continued to strengthen into a hurricane on august <num> peaking with winds of <num> mph <num> km h the next day
on august <num> a strong frontal trough weakened the high pressure system to the storm 's north causing a turn to the north during the next few days
the hurricane weakened in response to cooler water and increasing vertical wind shear which removed convection from its center
kenna weakened back to tropical storm strength on august <num> then into a tropical depression on august <num>
the system dissipated as a tropical cyclone on august <num>
after moving across the atlantic and caribbean sea without development the system moved through the intertropical convergence zone of the northeastern pacific ocean
the cloudiness moved northward toward the gulf of tehuantepec on august <num>
the thunderstorm activity organized sufficiently for the system to be upgraded to tropical depression fifteen @-@ e on august <num> while <num> mi <num> km southeast of acapulco mexico
the depression moved west @-@ northwestward and strengthened into a tropical storm <num> mi <num> km south @-@ southwest of puerto vallarta on august <num>
the storm began to turn more westward due to a strengthening high pressure system to its north and was upgraded to a hurricane on august <num> while <num> mi <num> km southwest of cabo san lucas
as the high to the north continued to strengthen the hurricane turned west @-@ southwest
thunderstorm activity with the hurricane began to weaken and lowell was downgraded back to tropical storm status on august <num>
the tropical storm then turned to a north @-@ northwestward with the storm passing over cooler waters
on august <num> the storm was downgraded to a tropical depression with only minimal amounts of deep convection remaining within its circulation
lowell dissipated as a tropical cyclone on september <num> though a low @-@ level circulation of clouds could be seen on satellite imagery for the next few days
no damage or casualties was reported as a result of lowell
the wave moved west through the atlantic ocean and caribbean sea without significant development
the wave moved across central america and into the northeastern pacific ocean on august <num>
isolated convection with the system increased while south of the gulf of tehuantepec as the system moved northwest parallel to the southwest coast of mexico
once convective activity increased the system was upgraded to tropical depression sixteen @-@ e on september <num> while centered <num> mi <num> @,@ <num> km southwest of clarion island
a weaker than normal high pressure system controlled the movement of the depression and the system moved slowly to the west through its duration
the depression strengthened into tropical storm marie on september <num> and into a hurricane on september <num> while <num> mi <num> km south @-@ southwest of clarion island
marie reached its peak intensity of <num> mph <num> km h on september <num>
the hurricane crossed into the central north pacific on september <num> as a hurricane with maximum sustained winds of <num> mph <num> km h
the hurricane weakened thereafter and on september <num> marie regained tropical storm status
the system weakened into a tropical depression on september <num> and dissipated as a tropical cyclone on september <num> near the hawaiian coast
no casualties or damages were caused by marie
the wave entered the northeastern pacific ocean and began to show signs of organized thunderstorm development
tropical depression seventeen @-@ e formed on september <num> while centered <num> mi <num> @,@ <num> km south @-@ southwest of cabo san lucas mexico
the depression became better organized and strengthened into tropical storm norbert later in the day
on september <num> norbert absorbed tropical depression eighteen @-@ e which was in close proximity
norbert strengthened as it moved north @-@ northwestward
the tropical storm was upgraded to a hurricane on september <num> and formed an eye on september <num>
the storm reached its peak strength of <num> mph <num> km h sustained winds that day
turning north of due west norbert then weakened as it moved over cooler waters
it was downgraded to a tropical storm later on september <num> and then to a tropical depression on september <num>
norbert dissipated as a tropical cyclone on september <num> after losing all its deep convection
located in close proximity to tropical storm norbert the depression would soon enter a region of colder sea surface temperatures and the national hurricane center noted that only very little intensification was possible
as predicted norbert hindered further intensification of tropical depression eighteen @-@ e
the national hurricane center noted six hours later that the depression would likely be absorbed into norbert
the national hurricane center later believed that tropical depression eighteen @-@ e was dominating the interaction between the two systems and was forecast to absorb norbert
unlike the latter prediction norbert absorbed tropical depression eighteen @-@ e later that day
an area of convection entered into the northeastern pacific ocean a few hundred miles south of acapulco mexico
on september <num> tropical depression nineteen @-@ e formed from this convection while <num> mi <num> @,@ <num> km south @-@ southeast from the southern tip of baja california
the depression moved on a west @-@ northwestward track rounding the southwest side of a strong high pressure system
the depression continued to strengthen and was upgraded to tropical storm odile on september <num> and into a hurricane on september <num>
its intensity peaked with maximum sustained winds of <num> mph <num> km h on september <num>
the hurricane began to turn more northwestward in response to a high @-@ pressure system weakening to its north
odile began to weaken as it moved over cooler waters on september <num>
the cyclone regained tropical storm status on september <num> while it slowly progressed northward
the system weakened into a tropical depression status on september <num>
once it lost its deep convection odile was steered southwestward by the low @-@ level flow before it dissipated as a tropical cyclone on october <num>
its remaining low @-@ level circulation of clouds continued on a southwestward course thereafter
it moved westward and entered the eastern pacific ocean early on september <num>
cloudiness became concentrated with the system south of the gulf of tehuantepec
on september <num> the organized thunderstorm area was upgraded to tropical depression twenty one @-@ e while <num> mi <num> km south of acapulco
the depression developed slowly and became a tropical storm on september <num>
as rachel briefly moved northward before re @-@ curving and accelerating towards the mexican coast
the storm passed over the southern portion of baja california sur on october <num>
rachel made its final landfall midway between los mochis and culiacán and became the only system to make landfall from the eastern north pacific ocean in <year>
rachel decayed rapidly over land and the final public advisory on rachel was issued early on october <num>
its remnants continued accelerating over texas until they lost their identity
the highest rainfall total from the system in mexico totaled <num>
<num> in <num> mm at santa anita near the tip of baja california
across northern mexico thousands were homeless and <num> people died
in texas rachel 's remnants caused heavy rain
flooding occurred in the big bend area
on september <num> the system increased in convection as it was moving to the west and approaching central america
the southern extent of the wave crossed into the pacific ocean on september <num>
the wave continued westward and related thunderstorm activity increased during the following week
the convective system organized into tropical depression twenty @-@ e on september <num> nearly midway between mexico and hawaii
initially the depression drifted toward the northwest due to a large upper @-@ level trough located to its west
polo strengthened rapidly into a hurricane early on september <num> with its winds peaking at <num> mph <num> km h
since the storm was very small vertical wind shear caused significant weakening thereafter
on october <num> polo regained tropical storm strength as it was crossing into the north central pacific basin
it dissipated as a tropical cyclone later that day
there were no casualties or damages caused by polo
the wave moved into the northeastern pacific waters off the coast of colombia on september <num>
as the wave passed over southern central america rainbands and cloudiness increased with the system between october <num> and october <num> before the system merged with the itcz from october <num> to october <num>
signs of convective organization reappeared on october <num> and by october <num> the system was upgraded to tropical depression twenty two @-@ e <num> mi <num> km south of cabo san lucas mexico
the depression continued to develop and was upgraded to tropical storm simon on october <num> while <num> mi <num> km south @-@ southwest of cabo san lucas
due to a high @-@ pressure system to the north @-@ northwest simon continued on a west @-@ northwestward path
the tropical storm continued to strengthen to its peak intensity of <num> mph <num> km h by late on october <num>
simon passed over cooler waters and weakened back into a tropical depression on october <num>
the depression moved on a westward course and the low @-@ level circulation was displaced from its deep convection during the following day
simon then dissipated as a tropical cyclone early on october <num> across the open waters of the northeast pacific
it strengthened at a moderate pace and reached hurricane intensity on october <num>
trudy entered a favorable environment and explosively intensified reaching its first peak in strength on october <num>
at that time an upper @-@ level trough drifted trudy north which increased vertical shear causing it to substantially weaken the system back to category <num> hurricane status
the trough outran the storm and was replaced by a ridge which turned the storm back to the west and led to its re @-@ intensification to a category <num> hurricane
another upper level trough approached which pulled trudy northward once again and sheared the hurricane apart
the cyclone dissipated on november <num>
eventually some of its moisture spread over parts of mexico and the united states
except for socorro island trudy had no impact on land
the island reported hurricane force winds for seven hours
trudy also had an unusually large eye which was as large as <num> mi <num> km wide
trudy is the fourth @-@ strongest pacific hurricane in october behind kenna of the <year> season rick of the <year> season and patricia of the <year> season
trudy also spent <num> hours of its life as a category <num> hurricane longer than any other hurricane in the eastern pacific basin
it strengthened into tropical storm vance early on october <num> and then into a hurricane two days later
vance moved parallel to the west coast of mexico and approached the southern tip of the baja california peninsula
before it could strike land a high @-@ pressure area blocked vance 's path and forced the storm to transcribe a small clockwise loop over a two @-@ day period
during the loop vance encountered wind shear and cool waters stirred up by trudy as well as earlier in its duration
vance weakened to a tropical storm on october <num> and a depression on october <num>
the cyclone dissipated late on october <num>
ace is broadly speaking a measure of the power of the hurricane multiplied by the length of time it existed so storms that last a long time as well as particularly strong hurricanes have high aces
ace is only calculated for full advisories on tropical systems at or exceeding <num> knots <num> mph <num> km h or tropical storm strength
the figures in parentheses are for storms in the central pacific basin west of <num> ° w those not in parenthesis are for the eastern pacific basin
the cumulative ace for the eastern pacific this season fell within the official above normal grading being one of the most active
this occurred because the season had many intense storms that lasted for a long period of time
also it is important to note that this is the third highest ace only behind the <year> and <year> seasons respectively
no names were retired so it was used again in the <year> season
this is the same list used for the <year> season
storms were named trudy and vance for the first time in <year>
names that were not assigned are marked in gray
one name from the central pacific list was used – aka
it was the first usage for that name
the name is derived from the sport 's typical venue a stadium with an oval running track enclosing a grass field where the throwing and jumping events take place
track and field is categorised under the umbrella sport of athletics which also includes road running cross country running and race walking
the running events which include sprints middle and long @-@ distance events race walking and hurdling are won by the athlete with the fastest time
the jumping and throwing events are won by the athlete who achieves the greatest distance or height
regular jumping events include long jump triple jump high jump and pole vault while the most common throwing events are shot put weight javelin discus and hammer
there are also combined events or multi events such as pentathlon consisting of five events heptathlon consisting of seven events and decathlon consisting of ten events
for every multi event athletes participate in a combination of sprinting jumping throwing middle distance and long distance events
most track and field events are individual sports with a single victor but a number are relay races consisting of four members
events are almost exclusively divided by gender although both the men 's and women 's competitions are usually held at the same venue
it is one of the oldest sports
in ancient times it was an event held in conjunction with festivals and sports meets such as the ancient olympic games in greece
in modern times the two most prestigious international track and field competitions are athletics competition at the olympic games and the iaaf world championships in athletics
the international association of athletics federations is the international governing body
records are kept of the best performances in specific events at world and national levels right down to a personal level
however if athletes are deemed to have violated the event 's rules or regulations they are disqualified from the competition and their marks are erased
in north america the term track and field may be used to refer to other athletics events such as the marathon rather than strictly track @-@ based events
track and field @-@ style events are among the oldest of all sporting competitions as running jumping and throwing are natural and universal forms of human physical expression
the first recorded examples of organized track and field events at a sports festival are the ancient olympic games
at the first games in <num> bc in olympia greece only one event was contested the stadion footrace
the scope of the games expanded in later years to include further running competitions but the introduction of the ancient olympic pentathlon marked a step towards track and field as it is recognized today — it comprised a five @-@ event competition of the long jump javelin throw discus throw stadion footrace and wrestling
track and field events were also present at the panhellenic games in greece around this period and they spread to rome in italy around <num> bc
after the period of classical antiquity in which the sport was largely greco @-@ roman influenced new track and field events began developing in parts of northern europe in the middle ages
the stone put and weight throw competitions popular among celtic societies in ireland and scotland were precursors to the modern shot put and hammer throw events
one of the last track and field events to develop was the pole vault which stemmed from competitions such as the fierljeppen contests in the northern european lowlands in the <num> century
discrete modern track and field competitions separate from general sporting festivals were first recorded in the <num> century
these were typically organised by educational institutions military organisations and sports clubs as competitions between rival establishments
competitions in the english public schools were conceived as human equivalents of horse racing fox hunting and hare coursing influenced by a classics @-@ rich curriculum
the royal shrewsbury school hunt is the oldest running club in the world with written records going back to <year> and evidence that it was established by <year>
the school organised paper chase races in which runners followed a trail of paper shreds left by two foxes even today rssh runners are called hounds and a race victory is a kill
the first definite record of shrewsbury 's cross @-@ country annual steeplechase is in <year> making it the oldest running race of the modern era
the school also lays claim to the oldest track and field meeting still in existence originating in the second spring meeting first documented in <year>
this featured a series of throwing and jumping events with mock horse races including the derby stakes the hurdle race and the trial stakes
runners were entered by owners and named as though they were horses
<num> miles <num> km away and a decade later the first wenlock olympian games were held at much wenlock racecourse
events at the <year> wenlock games included a half @-@ mile foot race <num> m and a leaping in distance competition
in <year> dr william penny brookes of wenlock helped set up the national olympian association which held their first olympian games in <year> at the crystal palace in london
this national event was a great success attracting a crowd of over ten thousand people
in response that same year the amateur athletic club was formed and held a championship for gentlemen amateurs in an attempt to reclaim the sport for the educated elite
ultimately the allcomers ethos of the noa won through and the aac was reconstituted as the amateur athletic association in <year> the first national body for the sport of athletics
the aaa championships the de facto british national championships despite being for england only have been held annually since <num> july <year> with breaks only during two world wars and <year> – <year>
the aaa was effectively a global governing body in the early years of the sport codifying its rules for the first time
meanwhile the united states began holding an annual national competition — the usa outdoor track and field championships — first held in <year> by the new york athletic club
the establishment of general sports governing bodies for the united states the amateur athletic union in <year> and france the union des sociétés françaises de sports athlétiques in <year> put the sport on a formal footing and meant that international competitions became possible
the establishment of the modern olympic games at the end of the <num> century marked a new high for track and field
the olympic athletics programme comprising track and field events plus a marathon race contained many of the foremost sporting competitions of the <year> summer olympics
the olympics also consolidated the use of metric measurements in international track and field events both for race distances and for measuring jumps and throws
the olympic athletics programme greatly expanded over the next decades and track and field contests remained among the games most prominent
the olympics was the elite competition for track and field and only amateur sportsmen could compete
track and field continued to be a largely amateur sport as this rule was strictly enforced jim thorpe was stripped of his track and field medals from the <year> olympics after it was revealed that he had played baseball professionally
that same year the international amateur athletic federation iaaf was established becoming the international governing body for track and field and it enshrined amateurism as one of its founding principles for the sport
the national collegiate athletic association held their first men 's outdoor track and field championship in <year> making it one of the most prestigious competitions for students and this was soon followed by the introduction of track and field at the inaugural world student games in <year>
the first continental track and field competition was the <year> south american championships which was followed by the european athletics championships in <year>
up until the early <num> track and field had been almost exclusively a male @-@ only pursuit
a growing women 's sports movement in europe and north america led to the establishment of the women 's world games in <year> and this ultimately caused the introduction of five track and field events for women in the athletics at the <year> summer olympics
in china women 's track and field events were being held in the <num> but were subject to criticism and disrespect from audiences
in <year> physical education advocate zhang ruizhen called for greater equality and participation of women in chinese track and field
the rise of kinue hitomi and her <year> olympic medal for japan signified the growth of women 's track and field in east asia
more women 's events were gradually introduced as years progressed although it was only towards the end of the century that the men 's and women 's programmes approached parity of events
marking an increasingly inclusive approach to the sport major track and field competitions for disabled athletes were first introduced at the <year> summer paralympics
with the rise of numerous regional championships as well as the growth in olympic @-@ style multi @-@ sport events such as the commonwealth games and the pan @-@ american games competitions between international track and field athletes became widespread
from the <num> onwards the sport gained more exposure and commercial appeal through television coverage and the increasing wealth of nations
after over half a century of amateurism the amateur status of the sport began to be displaced by growing professionalism in the late <num>
as a result the amateur athletic union was dissolved in the united states and it was replaced with a non @-@ amateur body solely focused on the sport of athletics the athletics congress later usa track and field
the iaaf soon followed suit in <year> abandoning amateurism and later removing all references to it from its name by rebranding itself as the international association of athletics federations
the following year saw the establishment of the iaaf world championships in athletics — the first ever global competition just for athletics — which with the olympics became one of track and field 's most prestigious competitions
the profile of the sport reached a new high in the <num> with a number of athletes becoming household names such as carl lewis sergey bubka sebastian coe zola budd and florence griffith @-@ joyner
many world records were broken in this period and the added political element between competitors of the united states east germany and the soviet union in reaction to the cold war only served to stoke the sport 's popularity
the increase in the commercial capacity of track and field was also met with developments in the application of sports science and there were many changes to coaching methods athlete 's diet regimes training facilities and sports equipment
this was also accompanied by an increase in the use of performance @-@ enhancing drugs and prominent cases such as those of olympic gold medallists ben johnson and marion jones damaged the public image and marketability of the sport
from the <num> onwards track and field became increasingly more professional and international as the iaaf gained over two hundred member nations
the iaaf world championships in athletics became a fully professional competition with the introduction of prize money in <year> and in <year> the iaaf golden league — an annual series of major track and field meetings in europe — provided a higher level of economic incentive in the form of a us <num> million jackpot
in <year> the series was replaced by the more lucrative iaaf diamond league a fourteen @-@ meeting series held in europe asia north america and the middle east — the first ever worldwide annual series of track and field meetings
the majority of athletes tend to specialise in just one event or event type with the aim of perfecting their performances although the aim of combined events athletes is to become proficient in a number of disciplines
track events involve running on a track over a specified distances and — in the case of the hurdling and steeplechase events — obstacles may be placed on the track
there are also relay races in which teams of athletes run and pass on a baton to their team member at the end of a certain distance
there are two types of field events jumps and throws
in jumping competitions athletes are judged on either the length or height of their jumps
the performances of jumping events for distance are measured from a board or marker and any athlete overstepping this mark is judged to have fouled
in the jumps for height an athlete must clear their body over a crossbar without knocking the bar off the supporting standards
the majority of jumping events are unaided although athletes propel themselves vertically with purpose @-@ built sticks in the pole vault
the throwing events involve hurling an implement such as a heavy weight javelin or discus from a set point with athletes being judged on the distance that the object is thrown
combined events involve the same group of athletes contesting a number of different track and field events
points are given for their performance in each event and the athlete with the greatest points total at the end of all events is the winner
the first <num> editions of the ancient olympic games featured only one event the stadion race which was a race from one end of the stadium to the other
sprinting events are focused around athletes reaching and sustaining their quickest possible running speed
three sprinting events are currently held at the olympics and outdoor world championships the <num> metres <num> metres and <num> metres
these events have their roots in races of imperial measurements that later changed to metric the <num> m evolved from the <num> yard dash the <num> m distances came from the furlong or <num> <num> of a mile and the <num> m was the successor to the <num> yard dash or quarter @-@ mile race
at the professional level sprinters begin the race by assuming a crouching position in the starting blocks before leaning forward and gradually moving into an upright position as the race progresses and momentum is gained
athletes remain in the same lane on the running track throughout all sprinting events with the sole exception of the <num> m indoors
races up to <num> m are largely focused upon acceleration to an athlete 's maximum speed
all sprints beyond this distance increasingly incorporate an element of endurance
human physiology dictates that a runner 's near @-@ top speed cannot be maintained for more than thirty seconds or so because lactic acid builds up once leg muscles begin to suffer oxygen deprivation
top speed can only be maintained for up to <num> metres
the <num> metres is a common indoor event and indoor world championship event
less @-@ common events include the <num> metres <num> metres <num> metres and <num> metres which are run in some high school and collegiate competitions in the united states
the <num> metres though rarely competed has a star @-@ studded history pietro mennea set a world best in <year> olympic champions michael johnson and donovan bailey went head @-@ to @-@ head over the distance in <year> and usain bolt improved mennea 's record in <year>
the <num> yard run or half mile was the forebear of the <num> m distance and it has its roots in competitions in the united kingdom in the <num>
the <year> m came about as a result of running three laps of a <num> m track which was commonplace in continental europe in the <num> century
runners start the race from a standing position along a curved starting line and after hearing the starter 's pistol they head towards the innermost track to follow the quickest route to the finish
in <num> m races athletes begin at a staggered starting point before the turn in the track and they must remain in their lanes for the first <num> m of the race
this rule was introduced to reduce the amount of physical jostling between runners in the early stages of the race
physiologically these middle @-@ distance events demand that athletes have good aerobic and anaerobic energy producing systems and also that they have strong speed endurance
the <year> m and mile run events have historically been some of the most prestigious track and field events
swedish rivals gunder hägg and arne andersson broke each other 's <year> m and mile world records on a number of occasions in the <num>
the prominence of the distances were maintained by roger bannister who in <year> was the first to run the long @-@ elusive four @-@ minute mile and jim ryun 's exploits served to popularise interval training
races between british rivals sebastian coe steve ovett and steve cram characterised middle @-@ distance running in the <num>
from the <num> onwards north africans such as noureddine morceli of algeria and hicham el guerrouj of morocco came to dominate the <year> and mile events
beyond the short distances of sprinting events factors such as an athlete 's reactions and top speed becomes less important while qualities such as pace race tactics and endurance become more so
the latter two races are both olympic and world championship events outdoors while the <num> m is held at the iaaf world indoor championships
the <num> m and <num> @,@ <num> m events have their historical roots in the <num> @-@ mile and <num> @-@ mile races
the <num> m was historically used as a women 's long distance event entering the world championship programme in <year> and olympic programme in <year> but this was abandoned in favour of a women 's <num> m event in <year>
in terms of competition rules and physical demands long distance track races have much in common with middle @-@ distance races except that pacing stamina and race tactics become much greater factors in performances
however a number of athletes have achieved success in both middle- and long @-@ distance events including saïd aouita who set world records from <year> m to <num> m
the use of pace @-@ setters in long distance events is very common at the elite level although they are not present at championship level competitions as all qualified competitors want to win
the long distance track events gained popularity in the <num> by the achievements of the flying finns such as multiple olympic champion paavo nurmi
the successes of emil zátopek in the <num> promoted intense interval training methods but ron clarke 's world record @-@ breaking feats established the importance of natural training and even @-@ paced running
the <num> saw the rise of north and east african runners in long distance events
kenyan and ethiopian athletes in particular have since remained dominant in these events
typically a team is made up of four runners of the same sex
each runner completes their specified distance referred to as a leg before handing over a baton to a team mate who then begins their leg upon receiving the baton
there is usually a designated area where athletes must exchange the baton
teams may be disqualified if they fail to complete the change within the area or if the baton is dropped during the race
a team may also be disqualified if its runners are deemed to have wilfully impeded other competitors
relay races emerged in the united states in the <num> as a variation on charity races between firemen who would hand a red pennant on to team mates every <num> yards
there are two very common relay events the <num> × <num> metres relay and the <num> × <num> metres relay
both events entered the olympic programme at the <year> summer games after a one @-@ off men 's medley relay featured in <year> olympics
the <num> × <num> m event is run strictly within the same lane on the track meaning that the team collectively runs one complete circuit of the track
teams in a <num> × <num> m event remain in their own lane until the runner of the second leg passes the first bend at which point runners can leave their lanes and head towards the inner @-@ most part of the circuit
for the second and third baton change overs team mates must align themselves in respect of their team position – leading teams take the inner lanes while team mates of the slower teams must await the baton on outer lanes
the iaaf keeps world records for five different types of track relays
as with <num> × <num> m and <num> × <num> m events all races comprise teams of four athletes running the same distances with the less commonly contested distances being the <num> × <num> m <num> × <num> m and <num> × <year> m relays
other events include the distance medley relay comprising legs of <num> m <num> m <num> m and <year> m which is frequently held in the united states and a sprint relay known as the swedish medley relay which is popular in scandinavia and held at the world youth championships in athletics programme
relay events have significant participation in the united states where a number of large meetings or relay carnivals are focused almost exclusively on relay events
the first known event held in <year> was a variation of the <num> @-@ yard dash that included heavy wooden barriers as obstacles
a competition between the oxford and cambridge athletic clubs in <year> refined this holding a <num> @-@ yard race <num> m with ten hurdles of <num> @-@ foot and <num> inches <num>
<num> m in height each placed <num> yards <num> m apart with the first and final hurdles <num> yards from the start and finish respectively
french organisers adapted the race into metric adding <num> cm and the basics of this race the men 's <num> metres hurdles has remained largely unchanged
the origin of the <num> metres hurdles also lies in oxford where around <year> a competition was held over <num> yards and twelve <num>
<num> m high wooden barriers were placed along the course
the modern regulations stem from the <year> summer olympics the distance was fixed to <num> m while ten <num> @-@ foot <num>
<num> cm hurdles were placed <num> m apart on the track with the first and final hurdles being <num> m and <num> m away from the start and finish respectively
women 's hurdles are slightly lower at <num> cm <num> ft <num> in for the <num> m event and <num> cm <num> ft <num> in for the <num> m event
by far the most common events are the <num> metres hurdles for women <num> m hurdles for men and <num> m hurdles for both sexes
the men 's <num> m has been featured at every modern summer olympics while the men 's <num> m was introduced in the second edition of the games
women 's initially competed in the <num> metres hurdles event which entered the olympic programme in <year>
this was extended to the <num> m hurdles at the <year> olympics but it was not until <year> that a women 's <num> m hurdles event took place at the olympics having been introduced at the <year> world championships in athletics the previous year
outside of the hurdles events the steeplechase race is the other track and field event with obstacles
just as the hurdling events the steeplechase finds its origin in student competition in oxford england
however this event was born as a human variation on the original steeplechase competition found in horse racing
a steeplechase event was held on a track for the <year> english championships and the <year> summer olympics featured men 's <num> m and <num> m steeplechase races
the event was held over various distances until the <year> summer olympics marked the rise of the <num> metres steeplechase as the standard event
the iaaf set the standards of the event in <year> and the event is held on a <num> m circuit that includes a water jump on each lap
despite the long history of men 's steeplechase in track and field the women 's steeplechase only gained world championship status in <year> with its first olympic appearance coming in <year>
the athletes would take a short run up and jump into an area of dug up earth with the winner being the one who jumped farthest
small weights halteres were held in each hand during the jump then swung back and dropped near the end to gain extra momentum and distance
the modern long jump standardised in england and the united states around <year> bears resemblance to the ancient event although no weights are used
athletes sprint along a length of track that leads to a jumping board and a sandpit
the athletes must jump before a marked line and their achieved distance is measured from the nearest point of sand disturbed by the athlete 's body
the athletics competition at the first olympics featured a men 's long jump competition and a women 's competition was introduced at the <year> summer olympics
professional long jumpers typically have strong acceleration and sprinting abilities
however athletes must also have a consistent stride to allow them to take off near the board while still maintaining their maximum speed
in addition to the traditional long jump a standing long jump contest exists which requires that athletes leap from a static position without a run @-@ up
a men 's version of this event featured on the olympic programme from <year> to <year>
originally athletes would hop on the same leg twice before jumping into the pit but this was changed to the current hop step and jump pattern from <year> onwards
there is some dispute over whether the triple jump was contested in ancient greece while some historians claim that a contest of three jumps occurred at ancient games others such as stephen g
miller believe this is incorrect suggesting that the belief stems from a mythologised account of phayllus of croton having jumped <num> ancient feet around <num>
<num> m
the book of leinster a <num> @-@ century irish manuscript records the existence of geal @-@ ruith triple jump contests at the ancient tailteann games
the men 's triple jump competition has been ever @-@ present at the modern olympics but it was not until <year> that a women 's version gained world championship status and went on to have its first olympic appearance three years later
the men 's standing triple jump event featured at the olympics in <year> and <year> but such competitions have since become very uncommon although it is still used as a non @-@ competitive exercise drill
further competitions were organised in <year> in england and in <year> the basic rules of the modern event were standardised there
athletes have a short run up and then take off from one foot to jump over a horizontal bar and fall back onto a cushioned landing area
the men 's high jump was included in the <year> olympics and a women 's competition followed in <year>
jumping technique has played a significant part in the history of the event
high jumpers typically cleared the bar feet first in the late <num> century using either the scissors eastern cut @-@ off or western roll technique
the straddle technique became prominent in the mid @-@ <num> century but dick fosbury overturned tradition by pioneering a backwards and head @-@ first technique in the late <num> – the fosbury flop – which won him the gold at the <year> olympics
this technique has become the overwhelming standard for the sport from the <num> onwards
the standing high jump was contested at the olympics from <year> to <year> but is now relatively uncommon outside of its use as an exercise drill
one of the earliest recorded pole vault competitions was in cumbria england in <year>
the basic rules and technique of the event originated in the united states
the rules required that athletes do not move their hands along the pole and athletes began clearing the bar with their feet first and twisting so that the stomach faces the bar
bamboo poles were introduced in the <num> century and a metal box in the runway for planting the pole became standard
landing mattresses were introduced in the mid @-@ <num> century to protect the athletes who were clearing increasingly greater heights
the modern event sees athletes run down a strip of track plant the pole in the metal box and vault over the horizontal bar before letting go of the pole and falling backwards onto the landing mattress
while earlier versions used wooden metal or bamboo modern poles are generally made from artificial materials such as fibreglass or carbon fibre
the pole vault has been an olympic event since <year> for men but it was over <num> years later that the first women 's world championship competition was held at the <year> iaaf world indoor championships
the first women 's olympic pole vaulting competition occurred in <year>
in the <num> century cannonball throwing competitions within the english military provided a precursor to the modern sport
the term shot originates from the use of round shot @-@ style ammunition for the sport
the modern rules were first laid out in <year> and required that competitors take legal throws within a square throwing area of seven feet <num>
<num> m on each side
this was amended to a circle area with a seven @-@ foot diameter in <year> and the weight of the shot was standardised to <num> pounds <num>
<num> kg
throwing technique was also refined over this period with bent arm throws being banned as they were deemed too dangerous and the side @-@ step and throw technique arising in the united states in <year>
the shot put has been an olympic sport for men since <year> and a women 's competition using a <num> kg <num>
<num> lb shot was added in <year>
further throwing techniques have arisen since the post @-@ war era in the <num> parry o 'brien popularised the <num> degree turn and throw technique commonly known as the glide breaking the world record <num> times along the way while aleksandr baryshnikov and brian oldfield introduced the spin or rotational technique in <year>
in ancient times a heavy circular disc was thrown from a set standing position on a small pedestal and it was this style that was revived for the <year> olympics
this continued until the <year> intercalated games in athens which featured both the ancient style and the increasingly popular modern style of turning and throwing
by the <year> olympics the ancient standing throw style had fallen into disuse and contests starting within a <num>
<num> m squared throwing area became the standard
the discus implement was standardised to <num> kg <num>
<num> pounds in weight and <num> cm <num> inches in diameter in <year>
the women 's discus was among the first women 's events on the olympic programme being introduced in <year>
along with the discus the javelin was the second throwing event in the ancient olympic pentathlon
records from <num> bc show two javelin competition types co @-@ existing throwing at a target and throwing the javelin for distance
it was the latter type from which the modern event derives
in ancient competitions athletes would wrap an ankyle thin leather strip around the javelin that acted as a sling to facilitate extra distance
the javelin throw gained much popularity in scandinavia in the late <num> century and athletes from the region are still among the most dominant throwers in men 's competitions
the modern event features a short run up on a track and then the thrower releases the javelin before the foul line
the first olympic men 's javelin throw contest was held in <year> and a women 's competition was introduced in <year>
the first javelins were made of various types of wood but in the <num> former athlete bud held introduced a hollow javelin then a metal javelin both of which increased throwers performances
another former athlete miklós németh invented the rough @-@ tailed javelin and throws reached in excess of <num> m – edging towards the limits of stadia
the distances and the increasing number of horizontal landings led the iaaf to redesign the men 's javelin to reduce distance and increase the implement 's downward pitching moment to allow for easier measurement
rough @-@ tailed designs were banned in <year> and all marks achieved with such javelins were removed from the record books
the women 's javelin underwent a similar redesign in <year>
the current javelin specifications are <num>
<num> to <num>
<num> m in length and <num> grams in weight for men and <num>
<num> to <num>
<num> m and <num> g for women
other ancient competitions included throwing a cast iron ball attached to a wooden handle – the root of the term hammer throw due to their resemblance to the tools
in <num> century england contests involving the throwing of actual blacksmith 's sledgehammers were recorded
the hammer implement was standardised in <year> and the competitions began to resemble the modern event
the weight of the metal ball was set at <num> pounds <num>
<num> kg while the attached wire had to measure between <num>
<num> m and <num>
<num> m
the men 's hammer throw became an olympic event in <year> but the women 's event – using a <num> kg <num>
<num> lb weight – was not widely competed until much later finally featuring on the women 's olympic programme in <year>
the distances thrown by male athletes became greater from the <num> onwards as a result of improved equipment using the denser metals a switch to concrete throwing areas and more advanced training techniques
professional hammer throwers as historically large strong sturdy athletes
however qualities such as refined technique speed and flexibility have become increasingly important in the modern era as the legal throwing area has been reduced from <num> to <num>
<num> degrees and throwing technique involves three to four controlled rotations
outdoors the most common combined events are the men 's decathlon ten events and the women 's heptathlon seven events
due to stadium limitations indoor combined events competition have a reduced number of events resulting in the men 's heptathlon and the women 's pentathlon
athletes are allocated points based on an international @-@ standard points scoring system such as the decathlon scoring table
the ancient olympic pentathlon comprising long jump javelin discus the stadion race and wrestling was a precursor to the track and field combined events and this ancient event was restored at the <year> summer olympics intercalated games
a men 's all @-@ around was held at the <year> summer olympics contested between five american and two british athletes
the two basic features of a track and field stadium are the outer oval @-@ shaped running track and an area of turf within this track — the field
in earlier competitions track lengths varied the panathinaiko stadium measured <num>
<num> metres at the <year> summer olympics while at the <year> olympics the distance was a third of a mile <num>
<num> m at francis field
as the sport developed the iaaf standardised the length to <num> m and stated that the tracks must be split into six to eight running lanes
precise widths for the lanes were established as were regulations regarding the curvature of the track
tracks made of flattened cinders were popular in the early <num> century but synthetic tracks became standard in the late <num>
<num> 's tartan track an all @-@ weather running track of polyurethane gained popularity after its use at the <year> us olympic trials and the <year> summer olympics and it began the process in which synthetic tracks became the standard for the sport
many track and field stadiums are multi @-@ purpose stadiums with the running track surrounding a field built for other sports such as the various types of football
the field of the stadium combines a number of elements for use in the jumping and throwing events
the long jump and triple jump areas comprise a straight narrow <num> @-@ metre running track with a sandpit at one or both ends
jumps are measured from a take off board — typically a small strip of wood with a plasticine marker attached — which ensures athletes jump from behind the measurement line
the pole vault area is also a <num> @-@ metre running track and has an indentation in the ground the box where vaulters plant their poles to propel themselves over a crossbar before falling onto cushioned landing mats
the high jump is a stripped down version of this with an open area of track or field that leads to a crossbar with a square area of landing mats behind it
the four throwing events generally all begin on one side of the stadium
the javelin throw typically takes place on a piece of track that is central and parallel to the straights of the main running track
the javelin throwing area is a sector shape frequently across the pitch sports field in the middle of the stadium ensuring that the javelin has a minimal chance of causing damage or injury
the discus throw and hammer throw contests begin in a tall metal cage usually situated in one of the corners of the field
the cage reduces the danger of implements being thrown out of the field of play and throws travel diagonally across the field in the centre of the stadium
the shot put features a circular throwing area with a toe board at one end
the throwing area is a sector
some stadia also have a water jump area on one side of the field specifically for steeplechase races
full @-@ size indoor arenas i
e
those fully equipped to host all events for the world indoor championships bear similarities with their outdoor equivalents
typically a central area is surrounded by a <num> @-@ metre oval track with four to eight lanes
the track can be banked at the turns to allow athletes to run around the radius more comfortably
there is also a second running track going straight across the field area parallel to the straights of the main circuit
this track is used for the <num> metres and <num> metres hurdles events which are held almost exclusively indoors
another common adaptation is a <num> @-@ yard track <num> laps to a mile that fits into a common basketball court sized arena
this was quite popular when races were held at imperial distances which gradually was phased out by different organizations in the <num> and <num>
examples of this configuration include the millrose games at madison square garden and the sunkist invitational formerly held in the los angeles sports arena
all four of the common jumping events are held at indoor venues
the long and triple jump areas run alongside the central <num> m track and are mostly identical in form to their outdoor counterparts
the pole vault track and landing area are also alongside the central running track
shot put or weight throw is the only throwing event held indoors due to size restrictions
the throwing area is similar to the outdoor event but the landing sector is a rectangular section surrounded by netting or a stop barrier
in addition to hosting the world indoor championships the iaaf has hosted the iaaf world indoor tour since <year>
the most recent complete set of rules is the <year> rules that relate only to competitions in <year>
key rules of track events are those regarding starting running and finishing
in all races that are not run in lanes the start line must be curved so that all the athletes start the same distance from the finish
starting blocks may be used for all races up to and including <num> m including the first leg of the <num> × <num> m and <num> × <num> m and may not be used for any other race
no part of the starting block may overlap the start line or extend into another lane
all races must be started by the report of the starter 's gun or approved starting apparatus fired upwards after they have ascertained that athletes are steady and in the correct starting position
an athlete may not touch either the start line or the ground in front of it with their hands or feet when on their marks
for sprint races up to <num> m the starter gives two commands on your marks to instruct athletes to approach the start line followed by set to advise the athletes that the start of the race is imminent
the commands of the starter are typically given in the native language in national competitions or in english or french in international competitions
once all athletes are set in their starting position the gun or an approved starting apparatus must be fired or activated
if the starter is not satisfied that all are ready to proceed the athletes may be called out of the blocks and the process started over
there are different types of starts for races of different distances
middle- and long @-@ distance races mainly use the waterfall start
this is when all athletes begin on a curved line that moves farther out at the outer edge of the track
competitors are allowed to move towards the inside lane right away as long as it is safe to do so
for some middle @-@ distance races such as <num> m each athlete starts in their own lane
once the gun fires they must run in the lane they began in until markers on the track notify them it is time to move towards the inside lane
for sprint races athletes begin in start blocks and must stay in their own lane for the entire race
an athlete after assuming a final set position may not commence his starting motion until after receiving the report of the gun or approved starting apparatus
if in the judgment of the starter or recallers he does so any earlier it is considered a false start
it is deemed a false start if in the judgment of the starter an athlete fails to comply with the commands on your marks or set as appropriate after a reasonable time or an athlete after the command on your marks disturbs other athletes in the race through sound or otherwise
if the runner is in the set position and moves then the runner is also disqualified
as of <year> any athlete making a false start is disqualified
in international elite competition electronically tethered starting blocks sense the reaction time of the athletes
if the athlete reacts in less than <num>
<num> second an alert sounds for a recall starter and the offending athlete is guilty of a false start
if an athlete leaves their lane or steps on the line demarking each lane the athlete will be disqualified
lane rules also apply for initial periods of other track races for example the beginning of the <num> m
similar rules apply for longer distance races when a large field of athletes is present and separate starting points are designated with the field merging into one group shortly after the starting phase
any athlete who jostles or obstructs another athlete in a way that impedes his progress should be disqualified from that event
however if an athlete is pushed or forced by another person to run outside his lane and if no material advantage is gained the athlete should not be disqualified
the finishing position of athletes is determined by the order in which any part of their torso as distinguished from the head neck arms legs hands or feet reaches the vertical plane of the nearer edge of the finish line
fully automatic timing systems photo timing are becoming more and more common at increasingly lower levels of track meets improving the accuracy while eliminating the need for eagle @-@ eyed officials on the finish line
fully automatic timing fat is required for high level meets and any time a sprint record is set though distance records can be accepted if timed by three independent stopwatches
with the accuracy of the timing systems ties are rare
ties between different athletes are resolved as follows in determining whether there has been a tie in any round for a qualifying position for the next round based on time a judge called the chief photo finish judge must consider the actual time recorded by the athletes to one thousandth of a second
if the judge decides that there has been a tie the tying athletes must be placed in the next round or if that is not practicable lots must be drawn to determine who must be placed in the next round
in the case of a tie for first place in any final the referee decides whether it is practicable to arrange for the athletes so tying to compete again
if he decides it is not the result stands
ties in other placings remain
each attempt is measured to determine who achieved the longest distance
vertical jumps high jump and pole vault set a bar at a particular height
the competitor must clear the bar without knocking it off the standards that are holding the bar flat
three failures in a row ends the competitor 's participation in the event
the competitor has the option to pass their attempt which can be used to strategic advantage of course that advantage is lost if the competitor misses
a pass could be used to save energy and avoid taking a jump that would not improve their position in the standings
after all competitors have either cleared passed or failed their attempts at a height the bar goes up
the amount the bar goes up is predetermined before the competition though when one competitor remains that competitor may choose their own heights for the remaining attempts
a record is kept of each attempt by each competitor
after all competitors have taken their attempts the one jumping the highest is the winner and so on down the other competitors in the event
ties are broken by first the number of attempts taken at the highest height fewest wins and then if still tied by the total number of misses in the competition as a whole
the bar does not go back to a lower height except to break a tie for first place or a qualifying position
if those critical positions are still tied after applying the tiebreakers all tied competitors take a fourth jump at the last height
if they still miss the bar goes down one increment where they again jump
this process continues until the tie is broken
horizontal jumps long jump and triple jump and all throws must be initiated behind a line
in the case of horizontal jumps that line is a straight line perpendicular to the runway
in the case of throws that line is an arc or a circle
crossing the line while initiating the attempt invalidates the attempt — it becomes a foul
all landings must occur in a sector
for the jumps that is a sand filled pit for throws it is a defined sector
a throw landing on the line on the edge of sector is a foul the inside edge of the line is the outside edge of the sector
assuming a proper attempt officials measure the distance from the closest landing point back to the line
the measuring tape is carefully straightened to the shortest distance between the point and the line
to accomplish this the tape must be perfectly perpendicular to the take off line in jumps or is pulled through the center point of the arc for throws
the officials at the landing end of the tape have the zero while the officials at the point of initiation measure and record the length
whenever a record or potential record occurs that measurement is taken again with a steel tape and observed by at least three officials plus usually the meet referee
steel tapes are easily bent and damaged so are not used to measure everyday competitions
for major competitions each competitor gets three tries
the top competitors usually <num> or <num> depending on that competition 's rules or the number of lanes on the track gets three more tries
at that level of competition the order of competitors for those final three attempts are set — so the competitor in first place at the end of the third round is last while the last competitor to qualify goes first
some meets rearrange the competition order again for the final round so the final attempt is taken by the leader at that point
at other competitions meet management may choose to limit all competitors to four or three attempts
whatever the format all competitors get an equal number of attempts
additionally men 's high hurdles are at height of <num> inches compared to women 's hurdles which are <num> inches
for the intermediate hurdles <num> meter hurdles the men 's hurdle height is <num> inches compared to <num> inches for women
the international association of athletics federations is the global governing body for track and field and athletics as a whole
the governance of track and field at continental and national level is also done by athletics bodies
some national federations are named after the sport including usa track field and the philippine amateur track field association but these organisations govern more than just track and field and are in fact athletics governing bodies
these national federations regulate sub @-@ national and local track and field clubs as well as other types of running clubs
track and field contests make up the majority of events on the olympic and paralympic athletics programmes which occur every four years
track and field events have held a prominent position at the summer olympics since its inception in <year> and the events are typically held in the main stadium of the olympic and paralympic games
events such as the <num> metres receive some of the highest levels of media coverage of any olympic or paralympic sporting event
the other two major international competition for track and field are organised by the iaaf
the iaaf had selected the olympic competition as its world championship event in <year> but a separate world championships for athletics alone was first held in <year> – the iaaf world championships in athletics
the championships comprised track and field competitions plus the marathon and racewalking competitions
initially this worked on a quadrennial basis but after <year> it changed to a biennial format
in terms of indoor track and field the iaaf world indoor championships in athletics has been held every two years since <year> and this is the only world championships that consists of solely track and field events
the south american championships in athletics created in <year> was the first continental championships and the european athletics championships became the second championships of this type in <year>
the asian athletics championships and african championships in athletics were created in the <num> and oceania started its championships in <year>
there are also indoor continental competitions in europe european athletics indoor championships and asia asian indoor athletics championships
there has not been a consistent championships for all of north america which may be in part due to the success of both the central american and caribbean championships and the usa outdoor track and field championships
most countries have a national championship in track and field and for athletes these often play a role in gaining selection into major competitions
some countries hold many track and field championships at high school and college @-@ level which help develop younger athletes
some of these have gained significant exposure and prestige such as the ncaa track and field championship in the united states and the jamaican high school championships
however the number and status of such competitions significantly vary from country to country
among some of the first of these events to follow the olympic @-@ style model were the world university games in <year> the commonwealth games in <year> and the maccabiah games in <year>
the number of major multi @-@ sport events greatly increased during the <num> century and thus did the number of track and field events held within them
typically track and field events are hosted at the main stadium of the games
after the olympic and paralympic games the most prominent events for track and field athletes include the three ioc @-@ sanctioned continental games the all @-@ africa games asian games and the pan american games
other games such as the commonwealth games and summer universiade and world masters games have significant participation from track and field athletes
track and field is also present at the national games level with competitions such as the chinese national games serving as the most prestigious national competition for domestic track and field athletes
meetings are generally organised annually either under the patronage of an educational institution or sports club or by a group or business that serves as the meeting promoter
in the case of the former athletes are selected to represent their club or institution
in the case of privately run or independent meetings athletes participate on an invitation @-@ only basis
the most basic type of meetings are all @-@ comers track meets which are largely small local informal competitions that allow people of all ages and abilities to compete
as meetings become more organized they can gain official sanctioning by the local or national association for the sport
at the professional level meetings began to offer significant financial incentives for all athletes in the <num> in europe with the creation of the golden four competition comprising meetings in zürich brussels berlin and oslo
this expanded and received iaaf backing as the iaaf golden league in <year> which was later supplemented by the branding of selected meetings worldwide as the iaaf world athletics tour
in <year> the golden league idea was expanded globally as the iaaf diamond league series and this now forms the top tier of professional one @-@ day track and field meetings
doing so can not only serve as a way of determining the winner in an event but it can also be used for historical comparison i
e
a record
a large variety of record types exist and men 's and women 's performances are recorded separately
the foremost types of records organise athlete 's performances by the region they represent — beginning with national records then continental records up to the global or world record level
national governing bodies control the national record lists the area associations organise their respective continental lists and the iaaf ratifies world records
the iaaf ratifies track and field world records if they meet their set criteria
the iaaf first published a world records list in <year> initially for men 's events only
there were <num> recognised records in running hurdling and relay and <num> field records
world records in women 's events began in <year> as more events were gradually added to the list but significant changes were made in the late <num>
first all records in imperial measurements were abandoned in <year> with the sole exceptional being the mile run due to the prestige and history of the event
the following year all world records in sprint events would only be recognised if fully automatic electronic timing was used as opposed to the traditional hand @-@ timing stopwatch method
in <year> electronic timing was made compulsory for all world record runs in track and field with times being recorded to within one hundredth of a second
two additional types of world record were introduced in <year> world records for indoor competitions and world records for junior athletes under <num> years old
the next most important record type are those achieved at a specific competition
for example the olympic records represent the best performances by athletes at the summer olympics
all major championships and games have their relevant competition records and a large number of track and field meetings keep a note of their meet records
other record types include stadium records records by age range records by disability and records by institution or organisation
cash bonuses are usually offered to athletes if they break significant records as doing so can generate greater interest and public attendance in track and field competitions
the iaaf 's constitution incorporates the world anti @-@ doping code among other anti @-@ doping measures
practices such as blood doping and the use of anabolic steroids peptide hormones stimulants or diuretics can give athletes a physical competitive advantage in track and field
the use of such substances in track and field is opposed on both ethical and medical grounds
given that the sport functions by measuring and comparing athletes performances performance @-@ enhancing substances create an uneven playing field — athletes who do not use doping substances have a disadvantage over rivals who do
medically the use of banned substances may have an adverse effect upon athletes health
however some exemptions are made for athletes who take banned substances for therapeutic use and athletes are not sanctioned for usage in these cases such as kim collins failed drug test due to asthma medication
athletes have historically been willing to take legal and health risks to improve their performance with some even stating their willingness to risk their lives as exemplified by research by mirkin goldman and connor in researching attitudes to the so @-@ called goldman dilemma
to prevent use of performance @-@ enhancing substances athletes must submit to drug tests that are conducted both in and out of competition by anti @-@ doping officials or accredited medical staff
penalized athletes are susceptible to higher testing upon return to competition
athletes found to have taken substances on the world anti @-@ doping agency 's banned list receive sanctions and may be banned from competition for a period of time that corresponds to the seriousness of the infraction
however the use of substances not on the prohibited list may also result in sanctions if the substance is deemed similar to a banned substance in either composition or effect
athletes may also be sanctioned for missing tests seeking to avoid testing or tampering with results refusing to submit to testing through circumstantial evidence or confession of use
doping has played a significant part in the modern history of track and field
state @-@ sponsored doping in east germany with hormones and anabolic steroids marked the rise of women from the german democratic republic in track and field from the late <num> to the <num>
a number of these women such as marita koch broke world records and were highly successful at international competitions
some athletes who were following a doping plan from their teenage years suffered significant health problems as a result of the regime
ben johnson ran a new world record in the <num> metres at the <year> seoul olympics but was later banned for using anabolic steroids
in the mid @-@ first decade of the 21st century the balco scandal eventually resulted in the downfall of prominent sprinters such as marion jones and tim montgomery among others through their usage of banned substances
doping problems have also been associated with sprinters such as tyson gay michael rogers and justin gatlin all from the united states
doping has also affected entire nations such as russia which has been banned from competing at both the indoor world championships and the olympics in <year>
this ban was imposed in <year> after major allegations of doping and covering up were discovered in <year>
all these forms of racing tend to record finishing times have strictly defined start and finish points and are generally individual in nature
middle- and long @-@ distance runners usually participate in cross country and road events in addition to the track
track racewalkers are most typically road specialists as well
it is unusual for track and field athletes outside of these two groups to compete in cross country or road events
varieties of strength athletics such as the world 's strongest man and highland games often incorporate forms of footracing carrying heavy objects as well as throwing events such as the caber toss and keg toss which bear similarities to track and field throwing events
her name is particularly associated with her first book the <year> work mrs beeton 's book of household management
she was born in london and after schooling in islington north london and heidelberg germany she married samuel orchart beeton an ambitious publisher and magazine editor
in <year> less than a year after the wedding isabella began writing for one of her husband 's publications the englishwoman 's domestic magazine
she translated french fiction and wrote the cookery column though all the recipes were plagiarised from other works or sent in by the magazine 's readers
in <year> the beetons launched a series of <num> @-@ page monthly supplements to the englishwoman 's domestic magazine the <num> instalments were published in one volume as mrs beeton 's book of household management in october <year> which sold <num> @,@ <num> copies in the first year
isabella was working on an abridged version of her book which was to be titled the dictionary of every @-@ day cookery when she died of puerperal fever in february <year> at the age of <num>
she gave birth to four children two of whom died in infancy and had several miscarriages
two of her biographers nancy spain and kathryn hughes posit the theory that samuel had unknowingly contracted syphilis in a premarital liaison with a prostitute and had unwittingly passed the disease on to his wife
the book of household management has been edited revised and enlarged several times since isabella 's death and is still in print as at <year>
food writers have stated that the subsequent editions of the work were far removed from and inferior to the original version
several cookery writers including elizabeth david and clarissa dickson wright have criticised isabella 's work particularly her use of other people 's recipes
others such as the food writer bee wilson consider the censure overstated and that beeton and her work should be thought extraordinary and admirable
her name has become associated with knowledge and authority on victorian cooking and home management and the oxford english dictionary states that by <year> the term mrs beeton had become used as a generic name for a domestic authority
she is also considered a strong influence in the building or shaping of a middle @-@ class identity of the victorian era
she was the eldest of three daughters to benjamin mayson a linen factor merchant and his wife elizabeth née jerrom
shortly after isabella 's birth the family moved to milk street cheapside from where benjamin traded
he died when isabella was four years old and elizabeth pregnant and unable to cope with raising the children on her own while maintaining benjamin 's business sent her two elder daughters to live with relatives
isabella went to live with her recently widowed paternal grandfather in great orton cumberland though she was back with her mother within the next two years
three years after benjamin 's death elizabeth married henry dorling a widower with four children
henry was the clerk of epsom racecourse and had been granted residence within the racecourse grounds
the family including elizabeth 's mother moved to surrey and over the next twenty years henry and elizabeth had a further thirteen children
isabella was instrumental in her siblings upbringing and collectively referred to them as a living cargo of children
the experience gave her much insight and experience in how to manage a family and its household
after a brief education at a boarding school in islington in <year> isabella was sent to school in heidelberg germany accompanied by her stepsister jane dorling
isabella became proficient in the piano and excelled in french and german she also gained knowledge and experience in making pastry
she had returned to epsom by the summer of <year> and took further lessons in pastry @-@ making from a local baker
his family had lived in milk street at the same time as the maysons — samuel 's father still ran the dolphin tavern there — and samuel 's sisters had also attended the same heidelberg school as isabella
samuel was the first british publisher of harriet beecher stowe 's uncle tom 's cabin in <year> and had also released two innovative and pioneering journals the englishwoman 's domestic magazine in <year> and the boys own magazine in <year>
the couple entered into extensive correspondence in <year> — in which isabella signed her letters as fatty — and they announced their engagement in june <year>
the marriage took place at st martin 's church epsom in july the following year and was announced in the times
samuel was a discreet but firm believer in the equality of women and their relationship both personal and professional was an equal partnership
the couple went to paris for a three @-@ week honeymoon after which samuel 's mother joined them in a visit to heidelberg
they returned to britain in august when the newlyweds moved into <num> chandos villas a large italianate house in pinner
within a month of returning from their honeymoon isabella was pregnant
a few weeks before the birth samuel persuaded his wife to contribute to the englishwoman 's domestic magazine a publication that the food writers mary aylett and olive ordish consider was designed to make women content with their lot inside the home not to interest them in the world outside
the magazine was affordable aimed at young middle class women and was commercially successful selling <num> @,@ <num> issues a month by <year>
isabella began by translating french fiction for publication as stories or serials
shortly afterwards she started to work on the cookery column — which had been moribund for the previous six months following the departure of the previous correspondent — and the household article
the beetons son samuel orchart was born towards the end of may <year> but died at the end of august that year
on the death certificate the cause of death was given as diarrhoea and cholera although hughes hypothesises that samuel senior had unknowingly contracted syphilis in a premarital liaison with a prostitute and had unwittingly passed the condition on to his wife which would have infected his son
while coping with the loss of her child isabella continued to work at the englishwoman 's domestic magazine
although she was not a regular cook she and samuel obtained recipes from other sources
a request to receive the readers own recipes led to over <num> @,@ <num> being sent in which were selected and edited by the beetons
published works were also copied largely unattributed to any of the sources
these included eliza acton 's modern cookery for private families elizabeth raffald 's the experienced english housekeeper marie @-@ antoine carême 's le pâtissier royal parisien louis eustache ude 's the french cook alexis soyer 's the modern housewife or ménagère and the pantropheon hannah glasse 's the art of cookery made plain and easy maria eliza rundell 's a new system of domestic cookery and the works of charles elmé francatelli
suzanne daly and ross g
forman in their examination of victorian cooking culture consider that the plagiarism makes it an important index of mid @-@ victorian and middle @-@ class society because the production of the text from its own readers ensures that it is a reflection of what was actually being cooked and eaten at the time
in copying the recipes of others isabella was following the recommendation given to her by henrietta english a family friend who wrote that cookery is a science that is only learnt by long experience and years of study which of course you have not had
therefore my advice would be compile a book from receipts from a variety of the best books published on cookery and heaven knows there is a great variety for you to choose from
the beetons partly followed the layout of acton 's recipes although with a major alteration whereas the earlier writer provided the method of cooking followed by a list of the required ingredients the recipes in the englishwoman 's domestic magazine listed the components before the cooking process
isabella 's standardised layout used for the recipes also showed the approximate costs of each serving the seasonality of the ingredients and the number of portions per dish
according to the twentieth @-@ century british cookery writer elizabeth david one of the strengths of isabella 's writing was in the clarity and details of her general instructions her brisk comments her no @-@ nonsense asides
margaret beetham the historian sees that one of the strengths of the book was the consistent principle of organisation which made its heterogeneous contents look uniform and orderly and brought a consistent style in presentation and layout
whereas daly and forman consider such an approach as nothing if not formulaic hughes sees it as the thing most beloved by the mid victorians a system
during the particularly bitter winter of <year> – <num> isabella prepared her own soup that she served to the poor of pinner soup for benevolent purposes her sister later recalled that isabella was busy making the soup for the poor and the children used to call with their cans regularly to be refilled
the recipe would become the only entry in her book of household management that was her own
after two years of miscarriages the couple 's second son was born in june <year> he was also named samuel orchart beeton
hughes sees the miscarriages as further evidence of samuel 's syphilis
as early as <year> the beetons had considered using the magazine columns as the basis of a book of collected recipes and homecare advice hughes believes and in november <year> they launched a series of <num> @-@ page monthly supplements with the englishwoman 's domestic magazine
the print block for the whole series of the supplements was set from the beginning so the break between each edition was fixed at <num> pages regardless of the text and in several issues the text of a sentence or recipe is split between the end of one instalment and the beginning of the next
the beetons decided to revamp the englishwoman 's domestic magazine particularly the fashion column which the historian graham nown describes as a rather drab piece
they travelled to paris in march <year> to meet adolphe goubaud the publisher of the french magazine le moniteur de la mode
the magazine carried a full @-@ sized dress pattern outlined on a fold @-@ out piece of paper for users to cut out and make their own dresses
the beetons came to an agreement with goubaud for the frenchman to provide patterns and illustrations for their magazine
the first edition to carry the new feature appeared on <num> may six weeks after the couple returned from paris
for the redesigned magazine samuel was joined as editor by isabella who was described as editress
as well as being co @-@ editors the couple were also equal partners
isabella brought an efficiency and strong business acumen to samuel 's normally disorganised and financially wasteful approach
she joined her husband at work travelling daily by train to the office where her presence caused a stir among commuters most of whom were male
in june <year> isabella and samuel travelled to killarney ireland for a fortnight 's holiday leaving their son at home with his nurse
the beetons enjoyed the sightseeing although on the days it rained they stayed inside their hotel and worked on the next edition of the englishwoman 's domestic magazine
isabella was impressed with the food they were served and wrote in her diary that the dinners were conducted in quite the french style
in september <year> the beetons released a new weekly publication called the queen the ladies newspaper
with the beetons busy running their other titles they employed frederick greenwood as the editor
isabella included an extensive <num> @-@ page analytical index in the book
although not an innovation — it had been used in the family friend magazine since <year> — hughes considers the index in the book of household management to be fabulously detailed and exhaustively cross @-@ referenced
of the <num> @,@ <num> pages over <num> contained recipes
the remainder provided advice on fashion child care animal husbandry poisons the management of servants science religion first aid and the importance in the use of local and seasonal produce
in its first year of publication the book sold <num> @,@ <num> copies
it reflected victorian values particularly hard work thrift and cleanliness
christopher clausen in his study of the british middle classes sees that isabella reflected better than anyone else and for a larger audience the optimistic message that mid @-@ victorian england was filled with opportunities for those who were willing to learn how to take advantage of them
the food writer annette hope thinks that one can understand its success
if
young ladies knew nothing of domestic arrangements no better book than this could have been devised for them
the reviews for book of household management were positive
the critic for the london evening standard considered that isabella had earned herself a household reputation remarking that she had succeeded in producing a volume which will be for years to come a treasure to be made much of in every english household
the critic for the saturday review wrote that for a really valuable repertory of hints on all sorts of household matters we recommend mrs beeton with few misgivings
the anonymous reviewer for the bradford observer considered that the information afforded
appears intelligible and explicit the reviewer also praised the layout of the recipes highlighting details relating to ingredients seasonality and the times needed
writing in the morning chronicle an anonymous commentator opined that mrs beeton has omitted nothing which tends to the comfort of housekeepers or facilitates the many little troubles and cares that fall to the lot of every wife and mother
she may safely predict that this book will in future take precedence of every other on the same subject
for the <year> edition of the book the illustrated london news 's reviewer considered the work a formidable body of domestic doctrine and thought that the book is almost of the first magnitude
samuel 's business decisions from <year> were unproductive and included an ill @-@ advised investment in purchasing paper — in which he lost £ <num> @,@ <num> — and a court case over unpaid bills
his hubris in business affairs brought on financial difficulties and in early <year> the couple had moved from their comfortable pinner house to premises over their office
the air of central london was not conducive to the health of the beetons son and he began to ail
three days after christmas his health worsened and he died on new year 's eve <year> at the age of three his death certificate gave the cause as suppressed scarlatina and laryngitis
in march <year> isabella found that she was pregnant again and in april the couple moved to a house in greenhithe kent their son who they named orchart was born on new year 's eve <year>
although the couple had been through financial problems they enjoyed relative prosperity during <year> boosted by the sale of the queen to edward cox in the middle of the year
in the middle of <year> the beetons again visited the goubauds in paris — the couple 's third visit to the city — and isabella was pregnant during the visit just as she had been the previous year
on her return to britain she began working on an abridged version of the book of household management which was to be titled the dictionary of every @-@ day cookery
on <num> january <year> while working on the proofs of the dictionary she went into labour the baby — mayson moss — was born that day
isabella began to feel feverish the following day and died of puerperal fever on <num> february at the age of <num>
isabella was buried at west norwood cemetery on <num> february
when the dictionary of every @-@ day cookery was published in the same year samuel added a tribute to his wife at the end her works speak for themselves and although taken from this world in the very height and strength and in the early days of womanhood she felt satisfaction — so great to all who strive with good intent and warm will — of knowing herself regarded with respect and gratitude
the writer nancy spain in her biography of isabella reports that given the money the company made from the beetons work surely no man ever made a worse or more impractical bargain than samuel did
in subsequent publications ward lock suppressed the details of the lives of the beetons — especially the death of isabella — in order to protect their investment by letting readers think she was still alive and creating recipes — what hughes considers to be intentional censorship
those later editions continued to make the connection to isabella in what beetham considers to be a fairly ruthless marketing policy which was begun by beeton but carried on vigorously by ward lock and tyler
those subsequent volumes bearing isabella 's name became less reflective of the original
since its initial publication the book of household management has been issued in numerous hardback and paperback editions translated into several languages and has never been out of print
isabella and her main work have been subjected to criticism over the course of the twentieth century
elizabeth david complains of recipes that are sometimes slapdash and misleading although she acknowledges that prosper montagné 's larousse gastronomique also contains errors
the television cook delia smith admits she was puzzled how on earth mrs beeton 's book managed to utterly eclipse
acton 's superior work while her fellow chef clarissa dickson wright opines that it would be unfair to blame any one person or one book for the decline of english cookery but isabella beeton and her ubiquitous book do have a lot to answer for
in comparison the food writer bee wilson opines that disparaging isabella 's work was only a fashionable stance to take and that the cook 's writing simply makes you want to cook
christopher driver the journalist and food critic suggests that the relative stagnation and want of refinement in the indigenous cooking of britain between <year> and <year> may instead be explained by the progressive debasement under successive editors revises and enlargers
david comments that when plain english cooks were active in their kitchens they followed plain english recipes and chiefly those from the mrs beeton books or their derivatives
dickson wright considers beeton to be a fascinating source of information from a social history viewpoint and aylett and ordish consider the work to be the best and most reliable guide for the scholar to the domestic history of the mid @-@ victorian era
despite the criticism clausen observes that mrs
beeton has
been for over a century the standard english cookbook frequently outselling every other book but the bible
according to the oxford english dictionary the term mrs beeton became used as a generic name for an authority on cooking and domestic subjects as early as <year> and beetham opines that mrs
beeton became a trade mark a brand name
in a review by gavin koh published in a <year> issue of the bmj mrs beeton 's book of household management was labelled a medical classic
in isabella 's attempt to educate the average reader about common medical complaints and their management koh argues she preceded the family health guides of today
robin wensley a professor of strategic management believes that isabella 's advice and guidance on household management can also be applied to business management and her lessons on the subject have stood the test of time better than some of her advice on cooking or etiquette
following the radio broadcast of meet mrs
beeton a <year> comedy in which samuel was portrayed in an unflattering light and mrs beeton a <year> documentary mayston beeton worked with h
montgomery hyde to produce the biography mr and mrs beeton although completion and publication were delayed until <year>
in the meantime nancy spain published mrs beeton and her husband in <year> updated and retitled in <year> to the beeton story
in the new edition spain hinted at but did not elucidate upon on the possibility that samuel contracted syphilis
several other biographies followed including from the historian sarah freeman who wrote isabella and sam in <year> nown 's mrs beeton <num> years of cookery and household management published on the <num> anniversary of isabella 's birthday and hughes 's the short life and long times of mrs beeton published in <year>
isabella was ignored by the dictionary of national biography for many years while acton was included in the first published volume of <year> isabella did not have an entry until <year>
there have been several television broadcasts about isabella
in <year> margaret tyzack portrayed her in a solo performance written by rosemary hill in <year> anna madeley played isabella in a docudrama and sophie dahl presented a documentary the marvellous mrs beeton in the same year
the literary historian kate thomas sees isabella as a powerful force in the making of middle @-@ class victorian domesticity while the oxford university press advertising an abridged edition of the book of household management considers isabella 's work a founding text and a force in shaping the middle @-@ class identity of the victorian era
within that identity the historian sarah richardson sees that one of beeton 's achievements was the integration of different threads of domestic science into one volume which elevat ed the middle @-@ class female housekeeper 's role
placing it in a broader and more public context
nown quotes an unnamed academic who thought that mrs beetonism has preserved the family as a social unit and made social reforms a possibility while nicola humble in her history of british food sees the book of household management as an engine for social change which led to a new cult of domesticity that was to play such a major role in mid @-@ victorian life
nown considers isabella
a singular and remarkable woman praised in her lifetime and later forgotten and ignored when a pride in light pastry
were no longer considered prerequisites for womanhood
yet in her lively progressive way she helped many women to overcome the loneliness of marriage and gave the family the importance it deserved
in the climate of her time she was brave strong @-@ minded and a tireless champion of her sisters everywhere
keamy is introduced in the fifth episode of the fourth season as a crew member aboard the freighter called the kahana that is offshore the island where most of lost takes place
in the second half of the season keamy served as the primary antagonist
he is the leader of a mercenary team hired by billionaire charles widmore played by alan dale that is sent to the island on a mission to capture widmore 's enemy ben linus michael emerson from his home then torch the island
unlike lost 's ensemble of characters who according to the writers each have good and bad intentions the writers have said that keamy is evil and knows it
durand was contacted for the role after one of lost 's show runners saw him in the <year> film <num> <num> to yuma
like other lost actors durand was not informed of his character 's arc when he won the role
throughout durand 's nine @-@ episode stint as a guest star in the fourth season little was revealed regarding keamy 's life prior to his arrival on the island and durand cited this as a reason why the audience loved to hate his villainous character
critics praised the writers for breaking lost tradition and creating a seemingly heartless character while durand 's performance and appearance were also reviewed positively
keamy returned in the final season for a tenth and eleventh appearance
in the three years before the events of lost in <year> he worked with various mercenary organizations in uganda
in fall <year> keamy is hired by widmore to lead a mercenary team to the island via freighter then helicopter and extract ben for a large sum of money
once he captures ben keamy has orders to kill everyone on the island including the forty @-@ plus survivors of the september <num> <year> crash of oceanic airlines flight <num> the protagonists of the series by torching it
keamy boards the freighter kahana in suva fiji sometime between december <num> and december <num>
on the night of december <num> helicopter pilot frank lapidus jeff fahey flies keamy and his mercenary team which consists of omar anthony azizi lacour kocol redfern and mayhew to the island
on december <num> the team ambushes several islanders in the jungle taking ben 's daughter alex linus tania raymonde hostage and killing her boyfriend karl blake bashoff and her mother danielle rousseau mira furlan
the team infiltrates the barracks compound where ben resides blowing up the house of <num> survivor claire littleton emilie de ravin and fatally shooting three <num> survivors played by extras
keamy attempts to negotiate for ben 's surrender in exchange for the safe release of alex
believing that he is bluffing ben does not comply and keamy shoots alex dead
ben retaliates by summoning the island 's smoke monster which brutally assaults the mercenaries and fatally wounds mayhew
upon returning to the freighter keamy unsuccessfully attempts to kill michael dawson harold perrineau whom he has discovered is ben 's spy then obtains the secondary protocol from a safe
the protocol contains instructions from widmore for finding ben if he finds out keamy 's intention to torch the island which he apparently had
the protocol contains details about a <num> research station called the orchid that was previously run by a group of scientists working for the dharma initiative
keamy is also informed by captain gault that keamy and his mercenary squad may be suffering from some sort of mental sickness a notion keamy dismisses
later in the day omar straps a dead man 's switch to keamy rigged to detonate c4 on the freighter if keamy 's heart stops beating
that night frank refuses to fly the mercenaries to the island
in a display of power keamy slits the throat of the ship 's doctor ray marc vann and throws him overboard and later outdraws and shoots captain gault grant bowler during a tense standoff
frank flies the remaining five mercenaries back to the island
on december <num> the team apprehends ben at the orchid and takes him to the chopper where they are ambushed and killed by ben 's people — referred to as the others by the <num> survivors — and <num> survivors kate austen evangeline lilly and sayid jarrah naveen andrews
after a chase to recapture ben and a brawl with sayid keamy is shot in the back by richard alpert nestor carbonell who leaves him for dead unaware of keamy 's bulletproof vest
later keamy descends into the orchid 's underground level via its elevator to stalk ben who hides in the shadows
goading ben with taunts about his daughter 's death keamy is ambushed by ben who beats him into submission with an expandable baton before stabbing him repeatedly in the neck
though locke attempts to save his life for the sake of the freighter keamy dies and the dead man 's trigger detonates the explosives on the freighter killing nearly everyone aboard
in the afterlife keamy is a business associate of mr
paik sun ’ s yunjin kim father
mr
paik sends jin daniel dae kim to la to give keamy a watch and <num> @,@ <num> intended to be keamy 's reward for killing jin
however the money is confiscated at customs in lax and keamy is disappointed to discover it missing
he takes jin to a restaurant and has him tied up in a freezer
shortly after omar one of keamy 's henchmen captures sayid and brings him to the same restaurant
keamy explains to sayid that his brother has been shot because he borrowed money and failed to pay it back
after keamy threatens sayid 's family sayid retaliates and shoots keamy in the chest presumably killing him
chris carabott of ign wrote that in a show that features characters fraught with uncertainty keamy is the polar opposite and his marine mentality definitely sets him apart
his team has a physical advantage and with the help of mr
widmore they have a tactical advantage as well
keamy is like a bulldog being thrown into a cage full of kittens except for iraqi military torturer sayid
jay glatfelter of the huffington post stated that keamy is crazy … out of all the bad guys on the island — past present and future — keamy has to be one of the most dangerous ones
not because of how big he is or the weaponry but his willingness to kill at the drop of a hat
that doesn 't bode well for our losties protagonists
co @-@ show runner executive producer writer carlton cuse has stated that he and the other writers create complex characters because they are interested in exploring how good and evil can be embodied in the same characters and the writers are also intrigued the struggles we all have to overcome the dark parts of our souls however he later clarified that there is an exception keamy 's bad he knows he 's bad but he 's
a guy that does the job
damon lindelof stated that the great thing about keamy is that he is like a
merciless survivor
there s this great moment in the season finale where he just sort of hackie @-@ sacks a grenade thrown at him over to where his ally omar is standing
omar is certainly an acceptable casualty as far as keamy is concerned
according to a featurette in the lost the complete fourth season – the expanded experience dvd set keamy likes heavy weaponry and physical fitness and dislikes negotiations and doctors
lost 's co @-@ show runner executive producer head writer co @-@ creator damon lindelof enjoyed kevin durand 's supporting performance as tucker and checked to see if he was available for a role on lost
the casting director had durand read a page of dialogue for the new character keamy durand was offered the role in early october and he traveled to honolulu in hawaii — where lost is filmed on location — by october <num> <year>
a former stand @-@ up comic and rapper from thunder bay ontario canada with the stage name kevy d durand had seen only around six episodes of lost by the time that he won the part
when he was shooting he was confused by the story later stating i didn 't want to know anything or be attached to anybody
i 'm glad i didn 't
but now that i 'm on it i 'll watch all of it
durand revealed his appreciation for the cast crew and scripts and the fact that he had the chance to act as someone with a similar physical appearance to himself as he had previously done roles that had not prompted recognition from viewers on the street
durand was never informed of his character 's arc and only learned more of keamy 's importance to the plot as he received new scripts thus he was thrilled when the role was expanded for his third appearance in the shape of things to come when he kills alex and durand compared his excitement to that of a kid in a candy store
he also stated that you really don 't know what 's going to happen in the next episode and you get the scripts pretty late so it is pretty secretive and it 's kind of exciting that way because you 're really forced to get in the moment and say the words and play the guy
durand was initially met with negative reaction from fans on the street for this action and he defended his murderous character by arguing that it was actually more ben 's fault for failing to negotiate with keamy later fans warmed up to keamy
despite the antagonist 's increasing popularity and fanbase it became apparent to durand that fans were hoping for keamy 's death in what promised to be a showdown in the season finale
throughout his nine @-@ episode run keamy never receives an episode in which his backstory is developed through flashbacks and durand holds this partially responsible for the negative reaction to his character saying that the audience has not really seen anything outside of keamy 's mission so i think they definitely want him put down
following the season 's conclusion durand stated that he would not be surprised if his character returned in the fifth season and concluding that lost was really fun
if i can have that experience in any genre i 'd take it
durand returned for the sixth season episodes sundown and the package following a twenty @-@ two episode absence since his character 's death in the fourth season finale
keamy appears in the flash sideways parallel timeline in september <year> working for sun kwon 's father mr
paik to assassinate her new husband jin kwon daniel dae kim upon the couple 's arrival in los angeles
keamy and his sidekick omar are also extorting money from sayid 's brother omer prompting sayid to shoot them both aiding jin 's rescue process
jeff jensen of entertainment weekly commented that kevin durand is emerging as a real find this season he plays that mercenary part with a scene @-@ stealing mix of menace and damaged vulnerability
after jensen posted what he thought were the fifteen best moments of the season the new york post 's jarett wieselman ha d to complain about one glaring omission from ew 's list martin keamy
i have loved this character all season long — and not just solely for his physical attributes
although those certainly don 't hurt
alan sepinwall of the star @-@ ledger reflected he was only on the show for a season and not featured all that much in that season but kevin durand always made an impression as keamy
lots of actors might have his sheer physical size but there 's a sense of danger insanity that you can 't build at the gym you know ign 's chris carabott wrote that keamy is one of the more striking new additions to lost in the fourth season
and is a welcome addition to the lost universe
maureen ryan of the chicago tribune stated that keamy has so much charisma and she would rather find out more about him than most of the old @-@ school lost characters
tv guide 's bruce fretts agreed with a reader 's reaction to durand 's chilling portrayal of keamy and posted it in his weekly column
the reader nicknamed huntress wrote love him or hate him nobody is neutral when it comes to keamy which is the hallmark of a well @-@ played villain
even the camera seems to linger on durand who conveys malice with just a look or tilt of his head
this role should give durand 's career a well @-@ deserved boost
following his demise whitney matheson of usa today noted that it seems keamy lost 's camouflaged baddie is turning into a bit of a cult figure
a hilarious blog containing keamy digitally edited into various photographs posters and art titled keamy 's paradise was set up in early june <year>
tv squad 's bob sassone thought that the blog was a great idea and funny and he called keamy the boba fett of lost
in <year> kevin durand was nominated for a saturn award for best guest starring role in a television series
reaction to the antagonist 's death was mixed
kristin dos santos of e criticized the writing for keamy when he futilely asks sayid where his fellow <num> survivors are so that he can kill them but enjoyed his attractive physique writing that that guy is deep @-@ fried evil and he must die horribly for what he did to alex but in the meantime well he 's certainly a well @-@ muscled young man
the huffington post 's jay glatfelter also called for keamy 's death stating that nothing would be better to me than him getting run over by hurley 's dharma bus alluding to a scene in the third season finale
dan compora of syfy portal commented that keamy took a bit too long to die
yes he was wearing a bulletproof vest so it wasn 't totally unexpected but it was a bit predictable
in a review of the season finale erin martell of aol 's tv squad declared her disappointment in the conclusion of keamy 's arc stating that it 's always a shame when the hot guys die especially when kevin durand did an amazing job with the character … he 'll be missed
in a later article titled lost season four highlights martell noted durand 's strong performance that was particularly fun to watch and wrote that we the audience all know that widmore 's the big bad but keamy became the face of evil on the island in his stead
it originally aired on nbc in the united states on october <num> <year>
in the episode leslie tries to have the pit filled in and injures andy in the process opening pawnee up to a possible lawsuit
the episode was written by aisha muharrar and directed by charles mcdougall and featured guest performances by comedians paul scheer and h
jon benjamin
kaboom saw the filling in of the pawnee pit a focal plot device in parks and recreation since the first episode
as part of a multi @-@ network television campaign to spotlight volunteerism the episode prominently featured the real @-@ life organization kaboom a charity that builds playgrounds in locations all over the united states
according to nielsen media research the episode was seen by <num>
<num> million household viewers an improvement over the previous week
kaboom received generally positive reviews with several commentators praising the series for resolving the long @-@ standing pit subplot
it is the only episode of the entire series in which aubrey plaza does not appear as april ludgate
the purchases turn out to all be legitimate but leslie cancels the card anyway out of embarrassment when tom aziz ansari hears about her unusual purchases including a bucket of cake a man pillow in the shape of daniel craig and tuition to hogwarts school of witchcraft and wizardry

katz and home movies as pawnee 's lawyer
chris pratt actually appeared naked during filming of a scene in which he arrived at ann 's house without clothes on
michael schur co @-@ creator of parks and recreation said the scene was written because pratt loves taking his clothes off
the script prominently features kaboom a real @-@ life charitable organization that builds playgrounds in locations all over the united states
parks and recreation included the charity in the episode as part of a charity campaign called i participate sponsored by the entertainment industry foundation
the campaign involves more than <num> shows on nbc abc cbs fox and several other networks all of which spotlighted real @-@ life charities in an effort to encourage volunteerism
greg daniels the series executive producer and co @-@ creator was responsible for choosing the kaboom charity
in an editorial featured on the huffington post after the kaboom aired kaboom chief executive officer darell hammond called the episode ka @-@ perfect and said the writers certainly captured the spirit that fuels each of our playground builds – something that inspires volunteers to continue their great work and strive even harder to give back to their communities
within a week of the episode 's original broadcast two deleted scenes from kaboom were made available on the official parks and recreation website

steve heisler of the a
v
club said kaboom was the best episode of the second season and called parks and recreation one of the funniest shows on tv right now
heisler praised the show for not shying away from outrageousness and called andy 's naked entrance by far the highlight of the series
entertainment weekly writer henning fog said kaboom continued a trend of superior parks episodes in season two and praised the episode for filling in the pit claiming it both tied up a plot thread that had overstayed its welcome and put to rest any lingering ghosts from the first six episodes
matt fowler of ign said the episode was funny and served as good character development for leslie and andy
but fowler also said some scenes fell flat and questioned why ann would continue to harbor feelings for the immature andy
much of the area was part of the new netherland until the british exerted their control over the region
the english captured much of the area in its war with the dutch around <year> and the majority of the conquered land became the province of new york
the duke of york and the king of england would later grant others ownership of the land which would become the province of new jersey and the province of pennsylvania
the delaware colony later separated from pennsylvania which was founded by william penn
the middle colonies had lots of rich soil which was allowing the area to become a major exporter of wheat and other grains
the lumber and shipbuilding industries enjoyed success in the middle colonies because of the abundant forests and pennsylvania saw moderate success in the textile and iron industry
the middle colonies were the most ethnically and religiously diverse british colonies in north america they had settlers coming from all parts of europe
civil unrest in europe and other colonies saw an influx of immigrants to the middle colonies in the <num> century
with the new arrivals came various religions which were protected in the middle colonies by written freedom of religion laws
this tolerance was very unusual and distinct from other british colonies
the dutch soon claimed the land
although the swedes and the dutch fought over the land in the <num> through the ultimately the dutch claimed the land calling it new netherland
in the <num> the english largely conquered this land from the dutch renaming the area new york after the duke of york james ii
the colony 's land was periodically granted to various proprietors and split into the province of new york and the province of pennsylvania
james ii later granted the land between the hudson river and the delaware river to two friends who had been loyal to him through the english civil war sir george carteret and lord berkeley of stratton
this land grant became the province of new jersey
in <year> the concession and agreement was written in an effort to entice settlers to new jersey
this document provided for religious freedom no taxes without assembly approval and a governor appointed by the proprietors
the first governor appointed in this way was philip carteret who founded elizabethtown
colonists were required to pay annual quit @-@ rent taxes
on march <num> <year> after encountering difficulty collecting the taxes lord berkeley sold his share in the colony to edward byllynge a quaker businessman from london
this sale divided new jersey into east jersey and west jersey however the border between the two was not agreed upon until the quintipartite deed in <year>

the provincial congress of new jersey made up of elected delegates formed in january <year> to govern the colony
the congress had royal governor william franklin arrested on june <num> declaring him an enemy to the liberties of this country
on july <num> <year> new jersey enacted the new jersey state constitution soon after having empowered delegates to the continental congress on june <num> to join in a declaration of independence
the united states declaration of independence ended their colonial status
penn wrote the frame of government of pennsylvania before departing for the colony which called for religious tolerance towards many groups including the religious society of friends and local natives
as a proprietary colony penn governed pennsylvania yet its citizens were still subject to the english crown and laws
penn 's cousin william markham served as the first colonial deputy governor
demarcated by the <num> parallel north and <num> parallel north pennsylvania was bordered by the delaware river and the colonies of new york maryland and new jersey
in <year> dutch land given to penn by the duke of york was separated and once again became part of the delaware colony
from <year> to <year> revolution in england deprived penn of the governance of his colony
the pennsylvania assembly took this opportunity to request expanded power for elected officials led by david lloyd
upon visiting the colony in <year> and <year> penn eventually agreed to allow their charter of privileges to be added to the constitution
when the british banned western expansion in <year> fighting among colonists and against the natives swelled
in <year> arthur st
clair ordered the arrest of a virginian officer who was commanding troops against armed settlers loyal to pennsylvania
pennsylvanian revolutionary sentiment continued to grow and philadelphia the largest city in america soon became the meeting place of the continental congress
the publication of the pennsylvania constitution of <year> by locally elected revolutionaries concluded the history of the colony and began the commonwealth of pennsylvania
the english captured the new netherland colony from the dutch in <year> renaming it the province of new york after the king 's brother the duke of york later king james ii
the dutch recaptured the colony in july <year> during the third anglo @-@ dutch war but gave it back to the english under the treaty of westminster in exchange for suriname
the duke of york never governed the colony himself he instead appointed governors councils and other officers to run the government
richard nicolls served as the first governor of new york

a colonial assembly convened in october <year> making new york the last colony to have an assembly
a constitution was drafted and passed on october <num> <year> giving the colonists many rights including the rights to taxation without representation
however upon learning of the constitution james ii declared it void
when the duke of york became king james ii of england new york became a royal province
in may <year> the province briefly became part of the dominion of new england
when james ii was overthrown the citizens of new york rebelled against the royal governor in leisler 's rebellion
when henry sloughter became governor in march <year> the rebellion was crushed and its leader jacob leisler was arrested tried and executed for treason
new york 's charter and constitution were reinstated soon after
in april <year> american patriots formed the new york provincial congress to replace the assembly
governor william tryon and all royal officials were forced from the colony on october <num> <year>
colonial status ended for the new state with the united states declaration of independence in july <year>
the dutch maintained control of delaware until <year> when sir robert carr took new amstel for the duke of york renaming it new castle
a deputy of the duke governed delaware from <year> to <year>
when william penn received his land grant of pennsylvania in <year> he received the delaware area from the duke of york and dubbed them the three lower counties on the delaware river
in <year> after he had troubles governing the ethnically diverse delaware territory penn agreed to allow them a separate colonial assembly
because of the large grain exports resulting from this soil the colonies came to be known as the bread basket colonies
pennsylvania became a leading exporter of wheat corn rye hemp and flax making it the leading food producer in the colonies and later states between the years of <year> and <year>
broad navigable rivers of relaxed current like the susquehanna river the delaware river and the hudson river attracted diverse business
fur trappers moved along these rivers and there was enough flow to enable milling with water wheel power
these industries along with the presence of deep river estuaries led to the appearance of important ports like new york and philadelphia
while the middle colonies had far more industry than the southern colonies it still did not rival the industry of new england
in pennsylvania sawmills and gristmills were abundant and the textile industry grew quickly
the colony also became a major producer of pig iron and its products including the pennsylvania long rifle and the conestoga wagon
other important industries included printing publishing and the related industry of papermaking
these coalitions eventually grew into diverse and large political organizations evolving especially during the french and indian war
the middle colonies were generally run by royal or proprietary governors and elected colonial assemblies
many middle colony constitutions guaranteed freedom of religion and forbade taxation without representation
royal governors were arrested or overthrown on more than one occasion most notably when new jersey arrested its governor and during leisler 's rebellion in new york
growing unrest in the middle colonies eventually led the region to become the meeting place for the continental congress and a center for revolution
however there were numerous pockets of neutrals and loyalists
landholdings were generally farms of <num> to <num> acres <num> – <num> hectares owned by the family that worked it
in new york 's hudson valley however the dutch patroons operated very large landed estates and rented land to tenant farmers
ethnically the middle colonies were more diverse than the other british colonial regions in north america and tended to be more socially tolerant
for example in new york any foreigner professing christianity was awarded citizenship leading to a more diverse populace
as a consequence early german settlements in the americas concentrated in the middle colonies region
indentured servitude was especially common in pennsylvania new jersey and new york in the eighteenth century though fewer worked in agriculture
german immigrants favored the middle colonies
german immigration greatly increased around <year> and many immigrants began coming from the rhineland
they were erroneously labeled the pennsylvania dutch the german word for german is deutsch and comprised one @-@ third of the population by the time of the american revolution
the industry and farming skills they brought with them helped solidify the middle colonies prosperity
they were noted for tight @-@ knit religious communities mostly lutheran but also including many smaller sects such as the moravians mennonites and amish the scotch @-@ irish began immigrating to the middle colonies in waves after <year>
they primarily pushed farther into the western frontier of the colonies where they repeatedly confronted the indians
other groups included the french huguenots welsh dutch swedes swiss and scots highlanders
welsh quakers baptists and methodists settled in the welsh tract of pennsylvania
while some welsh colonists like roger williams left to found rhode island anne hutchinson founded a seed settlement in new york
rhode island was not initially counted as part of new england having been excluded from the new england confederation but later joined the dominion of new england
thus the definition of the middle colonies sometimes changed and overlapped with rhode island 's colonial boundaries
after joining the dominion of new england however rhode island was permanently thought of as a new england colony
new york 's initial possession of parts of maine ensured a close relationship with other new england colonies like vermont and a continuing new england influence in the colony
both william penn and the lords baltimore encouraged irish protestant immigration hoping they could obtain indentured servants to work on their estates and on colonial developments
often areas of the middle colonies displayed prevalent irish cultural influence
the most common solution was indentured servitude of young whites
these were teenagers in britain or germany whose parents arranged for them to work for families in the colonies until age <num> in exchange for their ocean passage
the great majority became farmers or farm wives
by the mid @-@ eighteenth century african american slaves comprised <num> of the population of new york
most were house servants in manhattan or farmworkers on dutch estates
the penn family were quakers and the colony became a favorite destination for that group as well as german lutherans german reformed and numerous small sects such as mennonites amish and moravians not to mention scotch irish presbyterians
the dutch reformed were strong in upstate new york and new jersey and congregationalists were important in long island
the first great awakening invigorated religiosity and helped stimulate the growth of congregational methodist and baptist churches
non @-@ british colonists included dutch calvinist swedish lutherans palatine mennonites and the amish

much of the creamy gold bath stone used for construction throughout the city was obtained from the limestone combe down and bathampton down mines which were owned by ralph allen <year> – <year>
much of the development at this time consisted of new residential areas away from the old city centre
queen square was the first speculative development by john wood the elder who lived in one of the houses
the circus consists of three long curved terraces designed by the elder john wood to form a circular space or theatre intended for civic functions and games
the games give a clue to the design the inspiration behind which was the colosseum in rome
the most spectacular of bath 's terraces is the royal crescent built between <year> and <year> and designed by the younger john wood
gay street links queen square to the circus
all of which were designed by john wood the elder in <year> and completed by his son john wood the younger

john wood the younger raised funding for the construction of the assembly rooms by the use of a tontine an investment plan that is named after the neapolitan banker lorenzo de tonti who is credited with inventing it in france in <year>
it combines features of a group annuity and a lottery

he gave public readings in the assembly rooms and mentions them in the pickwick papers published in <year> in the ball @-@ room the long card @-@ room the octagonal card @-@ room the staircases and the passages the hum of many voices and the sound of many feet were perfectly bewildering
dresses rustled feathers waved lights shone and jewels sparkled
there was the music — not of the quadrille band for it had not yet commenced but the music of soft tiny footsteps with now and then a clear merry laugh — low and gentle but very pleasant to hear in a female voice whether in bath or elsewhere
george bridgetower an afro @-@ polish @-@ born virtuoso violinist made his debut at the assembly rooms in <year>

it was published by harold hersey and was an attempt to cash in on the growing comics boom and the popularity of the flash gordon comic strip in particular
the magazine contained a novel about flash gordon and three unrelated stories there were also eight full @-@ page color illustrations
the quality of both the artwork and the fiction was low and the magazine only saw a single issue
it is now extremely rare
after <year> when miracle science and fantasy stories was launched no new science fiction magazines appeared for several years
in <year> a science fiction comic strip following the adventures of superhero flash gordon appeared in newspapers and quickly became popular
in <year> the strip spawned a movie serial in thirteen parts also titled flash gordon
late that year harold hersey an experienced pulp magazine editor and publisher decided to launch three new magazines based on comics
the first two were titled dan dunn detective magazine and tailspin tommy air adventure magazine these were launched in september and october <year> respectively
the third was flash gordon strange adventures magazine which saw a single issue dated december <year> it was copyrighted by both hersey and king features the syndicate that owned the copyright to flash gordon
dan dunn and tailspin tommy produced one more issue each before hersey closed down the venture
it is not known why only one issue of flash gordon strange adventure magazine appeared poor sales figures from the other magazines may have been responsible or hersey may simply have run out of money or possibly king features the owner of the copyright to flash gordon only granted rights to hersey for one issue and withdrew from the venture after the first issue appeared
sf historian everett bleiler notes that hersey did not mention the venture in his autobiographical pulpwood editor published a year later and adds that given hersey 's usual attempts to glorify himself and to gild his failures this silence suggests a fiasco larger than usual
the magazine contained a lead novel and three short stories
the novel the master of mars by james edison northford or northfield the name is spelled one way on the contents page and the other way at the head of the story has been described by bleiler as moronic
bleiler also comments that of three short stories one is dated and another third @-@ rate
two of the stories were by r
r
winterbotham one the saga of the smokepot was published under his own name the other the last war was published under the pseudonym r
r
botham
the other story the man without a brain is a collaboration between r

hersey 's idea was to have a pulp magazine about comic strip characters he hoped that there would be sufficient overlap between pulp readers and comics fans to make the magazine successful
the presentation was like that of a typical pulp but with eight full page color illustrations all by fred meagher who had previously illustrated westerns
bleiler describes the artwork as crude and far inferior to the sometimes elegant work of alex raymond the creator of flash gordon
the attempt to market pulp fiction to comics fans turned out to be the wrong approach the comics field was on the verge of dramatic successes but the crossover appeal for pulp magazines was not there
the magazine was not widely known at the time it was issued and has since become extremely rare

the sixteenth named storm of the <year> season olaf formed on september <num> off the southern coast of mexico
it moved northward and quickly intensified reaching peak winds of <num> mph <num> km h before weakening and hitting oaxaca as a tropical depression
in mexico el salvador and guatemala the system brought heavy rainfall which killed <num> people and caused flooding and damage
it was originally thought that olaf dissipated over mexico although its remnants continued westward for a week
it interacted with hurricane pauline which caused olaf to turn to the southeast and later to the north to strike mexico again finally dissipating on october <num>
it moved slowly through the eastern pacific ocean and gradually developed an area of convection
concurrently an upper @-@ level low @-@ pressure area moved from the gulf of mexico across mexico into the pacific which produced wind shear across the region wind shear is the difference in wind speed and direction in the atmosphere and is usually harmful to tropical cyclogenesis
the disturbance associated with the tropical wave persisted and developed outflow
this caused the upper @-@ level low to move away from the system
on september <num> it was sufficiently organized to be classified tropical depression seventeen @-@ e while located about <num> miles <num> km south of the gulf of tehuantepec
a few hours after developing the depression attained tropical storm status or winds of at least <num> mph <num> km h
upon doing so the national hurricane center nhc gave it the name olaf
the upper @-@ level low which was moving away from the region caused the storm to move northward toward the mexican coast
olaf quickly intensified as evidenced by reports from a nearby ship and the winds reached <num> mph <num> km h by late on september <num> the nhc anticipated further intensification to hurricane status or winds of at least <num> mph <num> km h
instead interaction with the rough terrain of mexico caused weakening
olaf made landfall on salina cruz oaxaca early on september <num> as a <num> mph <num> km h tropical depression
within a few hours the circulation was not evident on satellite imagery and the nhc discontinued advisories
despite being considered dissipated a re @-@ analysis of satellite imagery indicated the circulation of olaf persisted as turned to the west toward open waters
early on september <num> the system reached the pacific and it continued westward for about a week during which it retained some convective activity
on october <num> olaf turned toward the east as it interacted with the large circulation of developing hurricane pauline
later that day the nhc resumed issuing advisories while it was located about <num> miles <num> km southwest of the southern tip of the baja california peninsula
the system turned to the southeast and failing to organize the nhc discontinued advisories on october <num>
three days later after the remnants of olaf turned toward the north the nhc again resumed advisories when it was just <num> miles <num> km south @-@ southwest of tecomán colima
late on october <num> the circulation of olaf made its final landfall near manzanillo colima and it quickly dissipated
an associated area of thunderstorms moved over open waters again but failed to redevelop
when olaf was strengthening faster than anticipated the advisory was upgraded to a hurricane warning although it was downgraded to a tropical storm after the intensification did not occur
upon making its first landfall tropical depression olaf produced gusty winds and heavy rains along the southeastern coast of mexico
the peak <num> ‑ hour rainfall total was <num>
<num> inches <num>
<num> cm in juchitán de zaragoza in oaxaca the highest rainfall total throughout olaf 's duration was <num>
<num> inches <num>
<num> cm at a station called soyalapa comaltepec in oaxaca
heavy rainfall was also reported in guatemala and el salvador
across the affected region the heavy rainfall caused flooding which resulted in <num> deaths
in mexico the flooding damaged <num> @,@ <num> acres <num> km2 of coffee corn and other crops in chiapas the coffee crop damage represented a severe cut into the yearly total
the precipitation flooded many buildings across the region including <num> houses in the chiapas capital of tuxtla gutiérrez when a river exceeded its banks
in mountainous regions mudslides left dozens of small villages isolated from the outside world
along the coast high waves of up to <num> feet <num> m forced the closure of all ports in three mexican states which affected thousands of fishermen
further west three fishing vessels were reported missing near acapulco prompting rescue parties
the storm also forced the closure of several airports
in its final landfall there was no damage reported precipitation in that region peaked at <num>
<num> inches <num>
<num> cm in coquimatlán colima
following the storm the mexican government sent food water and housing supplies to affected families in oaxaca
less than a week after olaf moved through southern mexico hurricane pauline struck the same region with much stronger winds
pauline caused heavier rainfall and more damage killing at least <num> people

kate moon of tv fanatic gave the episode <num>
<num> out of <num> stars
she said i had mixed feelings about this one despite its clever moments and hopeful ending
while i normally have no problems about family guy ’ s shocking or offensive themes i felt bit disconcerted about the direction of this christmas episode
she went on to say perhaps it was the way that the series stomped on something as innocent as santa and his elves and twisted them all around
or perhaps it was the cannibalistic reindeer
whatever the specific reason the irreverent nature of family guy seemed just a little too graphic for me this time around
the parents television council a conservative campaigning critic of seth macfarlane works named family guy its worst tv show of the week for road to the north pole for the week ending on december <num> <year>

the plaques later moved to the stadium 's monument park
the hill is controversial among historians and archaeologists opinions regarding the origin of structures found on the site vary from embankments created by early farmers to the remnants of a native american village and battlements due to the site 's similarity to the description found in the account of étienne brûlé of a settlement called carantouan
the area in the hill 's vicinity was previously occupied by susquehannock native americans
it was a common site for both amateur and professional archaeology as well as relic hunting
the source of the name remains unknown but various theories have been proposed as to its origin
he described the hill as a mountain in the shape of a sugar loaf about <num> feet high with level top on which are remains of intrenchments
one perpendicular breastwork is still remaining plainly indicating a parapet and ditch
in <year> another individual visiting the hill described the remains of a wall which runs around the whole exactly on the brow and within a deep ditch or intrenchment running round the whole summit
in <year> i
p
shepard created a sketch of spanish hill including the portions still visible at the time as well as those no longer extant
shepard enlisted the assistance of a longtime local resident charles henry shepard who claimed to remember fortifications as consisting of an embankment with a trench behind giving a height of four or five feet on the inside
in addition an indent was discovered on the site which was pronounced to be a corn cache by beauchamp
according to john s
clark a surveyor and historian active in the area until the early twentieth century the topography and size of the site were appropriate to correspond with brûlé 's description of carantouan brûlé described a palisaded town populated by approximately <num> warriors and <num> @,@ <num> individuals in total
he also described the dwellings and fortifications as being similar to those utilized by the wyandot people
clark 's conclusions were based in part on surveys he conducted at the site in <year> when he observed what he believed were fortifications atop the hill
amateur archaeologist ellsworth c
cowles conducted an excavation at the base of the hill in <year> uncovering what he described as seventy five postholes extending east and west as well as the effigy of a huge animal
located at an elevation of <num> feet <num> m above sea level it rises approximately <num> feet <num> m over the nearby floodplain of the chemung river
the hill is located in south waverly pennsylvania in bradford county just south of the state border with new york inside of territory once occupied by the susquehannock people
it has been acknowledged and studied by historians and archaeologists for over two hundred years
the source of the name is unknown but individuals traveling through the area between <year> and <year> described spanish ramparts as a feature of the hill and some of the earliest settlers to the region report that local native americans referred to the hill either as hispan or espan
in <year> étienne brûlé was sent to the area by samuel de champlain to meet with native american tribes in the hope of finding assistance to fight the iroquois against whom champlain had allied with the wyandot people
during his voyage brûlé recorded a town called carantouan meaning big tree according to ethnologist william martin beauchamp which was subsequently included on a map published by de champlain in <year>
in the early nineteenth @-@ century a native american man who lived in the area near spanish hill reportedly refused to ascend it for fear of a deadly spirit that lived on top
according to the man the spirit spoke with a thunderous voice and made holes through indians bodies
archaeologist louise welles murray suggested that this could be a reference to cannon or musket fire
in the early twentieth century archaeological and historical research was conducted regarding a potential connection between carantouan and the structures described on the hill
after surveying the area in spring and fall archaeologist l
d
shoemaker discovered evidence of native american habitation including shell heaps corn and flint chips along with various other implements
in <year> historian and archaeologist george p
donehoo after a survey of the site determined that it was impossible for spanish hill to have been the site of the town described by brûlé
he cited the sharp incline which would have made ascension difficult as well as the lack of water and archaeological evidence on the hill as evidence against it having been the location of carantouan
speculation that spanish hill was the site of the village was also countered by james bennett griffin who found nothing of interest in the area following an archaeological survey in <year>
however historian deb twigg suggests that prior excavations conducted by early twentieth @-@ century archaeologist warren moorehead as well as years of heavy farming activity in the area may have contributed to the lack of artifacts found during the griffin expedition
as twig wrote “ until more information is known it seems imprudent to eliminate spanish hill as a possible site related to the nation of carantouan as some researchers have done
” the site was a popular location both for archaeological excavations and amateur collecting
according to twigg spanish hill was looted by moorehead and his finds likely sold to collectors
in addition the area was heavily scoured by relic collectors approximately since the early nineteenth @-@ century
on october <num> <year> the historical society of bradford county pennsylvania dedicated a memorial on spanish hill in honor of the tricentennial of the arrival of brûlé to the present @-@ day border of pennsylvania
later in <year> section of painting and sculpture artist musa mckim depicted the hill in a mural entitled spanish hill and the early inhabitants of the vicinity for display in the united states post office branch of nearby waverly new york
the hill was nearly demolished and used for highway fill in <year> but the efforts were reportedly halted due to lobbying by local amateur archaeologist ellsworth cowles

<num> is the ninth episode of the sixth season of the science fiction television series the x @-@ files
it premiered on the fox network on january <num> <year> in the united states
the episode was written by john shiban and directed by daniel sackheim
the episode helps to explore the series overarching mythology
s
r
<num> earned a nielsen household rating of <num>
<num> being watched by <num>
<num> million people in its initial broadcast
the episode received mixed to positive reviews from critics
the show centers on federal bureau of investigation fbi special agents fox mulder david duchovny and dana scully gillian anderson who work on cases linked to the paranormal called x @-@ files
mulder is a believer in the paranormal while the skeptical scully has been assigned to debunk his work
in the episode mulder and scully have <num> hours to save assistant director skinner mitch pileggi from a biologically engineered disease
in order to combat the disease scully looks for a medical answer while mulder searches for the culprits behind the attack on skinner 's life
to aid him in this task mulder reaches out to senator matheson whom he hopes can help him find who is responsible before time runs out
before the writing of s
r
<num> the writers for the x @-@ files felt that the character of walter skinner was becoming too expendable
john shiban the writer of the episode decided to re @-@ work skinner back into the series mythology by crafting the episode around him
mitch pileggi had to endure long bouts of make @-@ up application a process that he admitted he hated
the nanobots in the blood sample were designed on a computer and then rendered for the final footage
his veins are a sickly purple hue and are pulsating ominously
suddenly he goes into cardiac arrest and the doctors begin to pronounce him dead
twenty @-@ four hours earlier skinner loses a boxing match after experiencing a dizzy spell
he is discharged from the hospital but fox mulder david duchovny and dana scully gillian anderson witness a bruise on his ribs growing
after trawling through security footage from the entrance to the j
edgar hoover building scully recognizes a physicist by the name of dr
kenneth orgel who advises the senate subcommittee on ethics and new technology who stopped skinner in the hall that same morning
mulder and skinner travel to the physicist 's house but find he is being held hostage
mulder apprehends one of the kidnappers who does not speak english
they release him since he has papers showing diplomatic immunity
mulder does a background check on him anyway
the background check leads mulder to senator richard matheson raymond j
barry which results in a dead end
scully discovers skinner 's blood sample and after checking she finds that skinner 's blood contains multiplying carbon
meanwhile skinner ends up in hospital following a gunfight in the fbi parking garage
mulder and scully reunite at the hospital where mulder tells scully that skinner was investigating a health funding bill called s
r
<num>
later the physicist dies of the same carbon blood condition from which skinner is sick
skinner remembers having seen on numerous occasions a bearded man who showed up suspiciously and who is actually running the scheme
he saves skinner and sacrifices one of his own men
the case is closed and skinner is once again aggravated with the agents ordering them to report exclusively to assistant director alvin kersh james pickens jr

the bearded man was actually alex krycek nicholas lea a rogue fbi agent who formerly worked for the syndicate who continues to control the potentially debilitating nanotechnology in skinner 's system
at the start of season six however the producers and writers felt that skinner 's character was becoming expendable
with their transfer away from the x @-@ files division mulder and scully saw less and less of their former boss
originally john shiban the writer of the episode wanted to infect mulder with nanobots
however he decided that since the audience knew mulder would not be killed this plot would not be very effective
in order to compensate for this loss shiban decided to re @-@ work skinner back into the series mythology by putting him in mulder 's place
shiban inspired by the <year> noir film d
o
a
and its <year> remake which he jokingly called two pretty bad movies decided to craft an episode of the x @-@ files around the conceit of a guy who 's been poisoned and has only a short time to live and has to use that time to find out why and by whom he 's being murdered
shiban began crafting his story by borrowing a nanobot plot that had been considered by various writers for several seasons
shiban and the rest of the writers made it a point to give alex krycek control over skinner
in this manner skinner once again became a mysterious character one whose true loyalties were being tested
shiban noted that krycek 's control gives skinner an agenda that mulder doesn 't know about
which was something we ultimately used again in the seasonender sic and will carry us into next year
the scenes were cut because of time @-@ constraints and budgetary reasons
however skinner 's boxing match proved easy to stage
mitch pileggi who had boxed competitively in college went for refresher course s at the goosen gym in los angeles
he later remarked it makes me happy that some people will assume there was a stunt double in the ring
there wasn 't
we both had a pretty good time
location manager ilt jones called s

<num> – <num>
<num> million years ago
discovered in <year> it was one of the first stegosaurians found
its only remains a partial skull and isolated teeth were found in the kirkwood formation
although owen initially identified the fragments as those of the pareiasaur anthodon after years of storage in the british museum of natural history broom identified the partial skull as belonging to a different genus and named the specimen palaeoscincus africanus
several years later nopcsa unaware of broom 's new name similarly concluded that it represented a new taxon and named the binomial paranthodon owenii
however since the nopcsa 's species name was assigned after broom 's and broom did not assign a new genus both names are now synonyms under the current naming paranthodon africanus
the genus name was chosen from the ancient greek para near and anthodon for the originally proposed similarity of the specimens
in identifying the remains as those of palaeoscincus broom basically classified paranthodon as an ankylosaurian a statement backed by the research of coombs
nopcsa however identified the genus as a stegosaurid which most modern studies agree with
in <year> the genus was reviewed and found to be a valid genus of stegosaurid
paranthodon is one of a few genera found in the kirkwood formation other such taxa include theropods like nqwebasaurus ornithopods and sauropods like algoasaurus
this was the first dinosaur find in all of the southern hemisphere and africa
in <year> and <year> bain sent some of the fossils to the british paleontologist richard owen for identification
among them was an upper jaw bain referred to as the cape iguanodon as such the site was named iguanodonhoek
atherstone published about the find in <year> but lamented in <year> that it had thus far received no attention in london
only in <year> did owen name a series of specimens from the collection as anthodon serrarius
anthodon means flower tooth
the partial holotype skull bmnh <num> the left jaw bmnh <num> the matrix bmnh <num> including bone fragments and impressions of the anterior skull and the vertebrae bmnh 47337a were all assigned to anthodon
in <year> othniel charles marsh assigned anthodon to stegosauridae based on bmnh <num> and in <year> richard lydekker found that although anthodon was a pareiasaur its teeth were similar to those of stegosauridae
in <year> the south @-@ african paleontologist robert broom visited the collection of the british museum of natural history
he concluded that owen had mixed the partial distorted skull teeth and a mandible of a pareiasaur and a partial upper jaw of a dinosaur bmnh <num> which were actually from two different species
broom kept the name anthodon for the pareiasaur but identified the other fossil as a member of the genus palaeoscincus naming the new species paleoscincus africanus in <year>
he found that the anatomy of the teeth were quite different even thought they resembled each other as well as those of stegosaurus
in <year> baron franz nopcsa unaware of broom 's previous publication provided a new name for broom 's p
africanus as d
m
s
watson believed that the jaw should be differentiated from anthodon
nopcsa named the species paranthodon owenii with the genus name derived from the latin para meaning similar near or beside and anthodon and specific name honoring owen
due to present conventions the specific name was later emended to owenii
in <year> walter coombs incorporated both names into the current nomenclature paranthodon africanus as paranthodon was the first new genus for the fossils and africanus was the first named species
this makes palaeoscincus africanus and paranthodon owenii junior synonyms of paranthodon africanus
the holotype of paranthodon bmnh <num> was found in a layer of the kirkwood formation dated between the berriasian and early valanginian ages
it consists of the back of the snout containing the maxilla with teeth the posterior caudodorsal ramus of the premaxilla part of the nasals and some isolated teeth probably from the lower jaw
one additional specimen can be assigned to it based on the dentition bmnh <num> including only isolated teeth sharing the same morphology as those from the holotype
however the teeth do not bear any autapomorphies of paranthodon and were referred to an indeterminate stegosaurid in <year>
thomas r
holtz jr
estimated that the animal was <num>
<num> m <num>
<num> ft long and weighed between <num> and <num> kg <num> @,@ <num> and <num> @,@ <num> lb
the snout is elongated though not extremely so and convex on top
the back of the premaxilla is long and broad and the external nares are large
the teeth have a prominent primary ridge
the fossilized nasal and maxillary bones are relatively complete and an incomplete premaxilla is also preserved
the partial snout resembles stegosaurus in its large posterior premaxillary process and the extension of the palate
however stegosaurus is the only stegosaurid known from adequate cranial material to compare with paranthodon and even though their resemblance is great tooth morphology is very distinguishing among the stegosaurians
for example cranial material is only known from stegosaurus paranthodon kentrosaurus and tuojiangosaurus and in all of them the tooth morphology differs
the maxilla of paranthodon preserves the tooth row and shows that there is little to no overhang
this differs from ankylosaurians where there is a large amount of overhang of the maxilla
the teeth also have a middle ridge with five fewer prominent ridges on either side
this is similar to the size ridges seen on kentrosaurus
like all stegosaurians the denticles on the teeth are rounded at the tips in contrast to ankylosaurians
also like huayangosaurus but unlike kentrosaurus and stegosaurus paranthodon possesses a prominent buccal margination a ridge beside the tooth row
paranthodon teeth preserve wear possibly cause by rubbing with other teeth
however wear is absent on most teeth similar to huayangosaurus meaning it is likely that paranthodon lacked occlusion between teeth
paranthodon is distinguished from other stegosaurs by a long wide posterior process of the premaxilla teeth in the maxilla with a very large cingulum and large ridges on the tooth crowns
not all of these features were considered valid in a <year> review of stegosauria with the only autapomorphy found being the possession of a partial second bony palate on the maxilla
however when broom assigned the name palaeoscincus africanus to the paranthodon fossils he classified them as an ankylosaurian
this classification was later changed by nopcsa who found that paranthodon best resembled a stegosaurid before the group was truly defined
coombs <year> found paranthodon to be an ankylosaurian like brooms naming it ankylosauria incertae sedis
however in reviews by galton in <year> it was found to instead represent a stegosaurid from the late cretaceous
multiple phylogenetic analyses have placed paranthodon in stegosauria and often in stegosauridae
a <year> analysis including nearly all species of stegosaurians found that paranthodon was outside stegosauridae and in a polytomy with tuojiangosaurus huayangosaurus chungkingosaurus jiangjunosaurus and gigantspinosaurus
however when the latter two genera were removed paranthodon grouped with tuojiangosaurus just outside stegosauridae and huayangosaurus grouped with chungkingosaurus in huayangosauridae
below is the analysis with all included genera
other analyses have found paranthodon closely related to tuojiangosaurus loricatosaurus and kentrosaurus within stegosaurinae
even though phylogenetic analyses recognize paranthodon as a stegosaurid the type material actually bears no synapomorphies of stegosauria
however the material is likely of stegosaurian nature and phylogenies by many authors have found it to be within the group
the formation is of a late jurassic to early cretaceous age with the oldest deposits from the tithonian about <num>
<num> million years ago and the youngest rocks being from the valanginian about <num>
<num> million years ago
a large variety of different animal groups have been found in the formation including dinosaurs at least two different sphenodontian lizards multiple teleost fishes a few crocodylians some frog specimens and also turtles
however a large amount of the material of the kirkwood formation only includes isolated teeth or partial and fragmentary pieces of bone
dinosaurs of the formation include a basal tetanuran and the primitive ornithomimosaurian nqwebasaurus the possible brachiosaurid algoasaurus and a potential titanosaurian and many ornithischians paranthodon a genus of iguanodontian and a hypsilophodontid the family hypsilophodontidae is no longer considered to be a natural grouping

city finished the season second five points behind sheffield united and were promoted back to division three
three months into the following campaign mcfarland and his assistant mick jones handed in their resignation and left for derby county

the club were again in financial difficulties and in june <year> martin called in the receivers and the club was put up for sale
a save bradford city fund was launched on <num> july and former chairman stafford heginbotham and former board member jack tordoff bought the club forming a new company and enabling the team to start the new league campaign
centre forward bobby campbell was sold to derby county to balance the books and john hawley brought in as his replacement
city struggled on the pitch and won just one of their first <num> games leaving them in the relegation zone
campbell had played just <num> games during four months with derby and so he returned to bradford initially on a loan transfer
his return coincided with a club record ten successive league victories
campbell finished the season with nine goals hawley with <num> but city finished seventh and missed out on promotion
the good form continued the following season and from october to mid @-@ december <year> city embarked on a <num> @-@ match unbeaten run during which time campbell became the club 's all @-@ time leading goalscorer beating frank o 'rourke 's <num> @-@ year @-@ old record
city went top of the division and held onto their lead opening an <num> @-@ point cushion by february
promotion was secured in april and the club 's first championship title since <year> after a <num> – <num> win over bolton wanderers
the success was overshadowed when fire ripped through valley parade 's main stand <num> minutes into the final game of the season on <num> may <year> against lincoln city
a total of <num> people died and the club did not play another game at valley parade for nearly <num> months
city instead played home games at elland road leeds road and odsal during the <year> – <num> season when they came <num> and for the first half of the <year> – <num> campaign
they returned to valley parade which had undergone a £ <num>
<num> redevelopment on boxing day <year> against derby county
after managing the side during the financial hardship and time away from their home ground cherry was dismissed only ten days after the return to valley parade
club coach terry dolan was appointed as manager and he led the side away from relegation and to a finish of <num> place
by september <year> dolan 's side topped division two for the first time in <num> years
they finished fourth after a final day defeat to ipswich town and missed out on promotion after they lost to middlesbrough in the play @-@ offs
leading players stuart mccall and john hendrie who had both stayed for another season in a bid to take city into division one both left and within two seasons city again dropped into division three
in january <year> stafford heginbotham resigned as the club 's chairman due to ill health
in january <year> geoffrey richmond took over as chairman
he cleared the debts loaned the club £ <num>
<num> million and promised the fans he would take the club to the premier league within five years
in his first season as chairman the club finished in seventh place with frank stapleton as manager
stapleton was sacked and was replaced by lennie lawrence
lawrence could only finish <num> in his first season before he left for luton town in november <year> to be replaced by his assistant chris kamara
kamara secured a play @-@ off spot with a final day victory over hull city before city defeated blackpool in the play @-@ off semi @-@ finals
the final against notts county was city 's first game at wembley
goals from des hamilton and mark stallard gave them a <num> – <num> win which secured promotion to division one
kamara used <num> players in <year> – <num> when city avoided relegation with a <num> – <num> victory in the final game against queens park rangers
kamara was sacked in january <year> after an fa cup defeat to manchester city when richmond claimed the manager had taken the club as far as he could
richmond again elevated from within and paul jewell who had been at the club since <year> was installed as manager originally on a caretaker basis
he was appointed full @-@ time in may <year> and richmond backed his new appointment with a multi @-@ million transfer budget
jewell signed strikers lee mills from port vale and isaiah rankin from arsenal for £ <num> million and £ <num>
<num> million respectively and signed former captain stuart mccall from rangers on a free transfer to lead the side
despite a poor start the club secured promotion to the top division for the first time in <num> years with a <num> – <num> victory over wolverhampton wanderers in the final game of the <year> – <num> season
city 's success meant that dean windass who had signed from oxford united in march became the club 's third £ <num> million signing of the season
windass had originally been signed for £ <num> @,@ <num> but an additional fee of £ <num> @,@ <num> was paid to oxford because of city 's promotion
jewell broke the club 's transfer record to add a fourth seven @-@ figure signing when he paid £ <num>
<num> million to leeds united for david wetherall
jewell added other senior players including neil redfearn and dean saunders prompting the media to call his team dad 's army
when city defeated middlesbrough <num> – <num> with a late goal from saunders his goal celebration mocked the critics comments
city failed to win another game until their eighth game of the season and sky sports pundit rodney marsh said they would be relegated and promised to shave off his hair at a home game if they avoided such a fate
a run of nine home games without defeat and consecutive victories in april gave city hope of avoiding relegation on the final day of the season
a final day <num> – <num> victory over liverpool with a goal from wetherall who had played every minute of the season and wimbledon 's defeat meant city survived with a record low of <num> points
less than two months after city stayed up jewell left to join sheffield wednesday to be replaced by his assistant chris hutchings
the club entered the intertoto cup the first time they had competed in a european competition in which they were defeated by fc zenit saint petersburg in the semi @-@ finals
richmond gave hutchings more money than jewell to spend in the transfer market and bradford paid a club record £ <num>
<num> million for david hopkin and £ <num>
<num> million for ashley ward and signed italian striker benito carbone on wages of £ <num> @,@ <num> per week
richmond also continued to re @-@ develop the ground which increased the capacity to <num> @,@ <num> but later referred to his spending as his six weeks of madness
in their second season in the premier league city struggled for form and hutchings was sacked after a start to the season in which he recorded just one victory from <num> league games
under new manager jim jefferies the club were unable to avoid relegation which was confirmed with a <num> – <num> defeat at everton when they missed two penalties before finishing the season with just <num> points
jefferies was sacked in december <year> following a training ground rift with captain mccall
nicky law was appointed his successor and the club finished the season in <num> place
during the summer with debts of nearly £ <num> million — as a result of the collapse of itv digital and the fall @-@ out from richmond 's self @-@ proclaimed six weeks of madness — the club were forced into administration
the players were all released but carbone waived much of the money owed to him to help the club survive under new owners julian rhodes and gordon gibb

although aerith successfully cast holy before her death it is held back by the power of sephiroth 's will
when sephiroth is finally defeated and holy is released it appears that it is too late to function as effectively as it should as meteor has already come too near to the planet 's surface
while holy clashes with meteor attempting to prevent its impact the gravity of both meteor and the planet pulling on holy in opposite directions weakens it
aerith is seen praying with both hands interlocked whilst urging the lifestream to ultimately defend the planet
the planet 's lifestream then flows forth intervening between holy and meteor and acting as a battering ram while aiding in the destruction of meteor
instead avalanche intend to use her to learn the whereabouts of the promised land for their own purposes although a member of the turks tries to protect her
aerith makes several appearances in the cgi film final fantasy vii advent children as cloud 's spiritual guide urging him to move on with his life and to forgive himself for the tragedies that were beyond his control telling him that she never blamed him for her death
during their spiritual reunion aerith speaks to cloud in an open meadow laden with flowers cheerfully and kindheartedly poking fun at how he needlessly burdens himself with the past
however she also acknowledges his suffering and offers kind words of support
one of aerith 's interactions with cloud comes when each member of the original game 's party helps in cloud 's final attack against bahamut sin she appears as the last party member to assist cloud
she also appears in the final scene of the movie along with zack fair where she gives cloud more words of encouragement before she and zack walk into the light
near the end of the film it is discovered that water mixed with the lifestream flows beneath the flowerbed in aerith 's church which manifests itself as a cure for geostigma
the on the way to a smile novella case of the lifestream – black white focuses on aerith and sephiroth 's respective journeys through the lifestream after the end of the game but before the events of the film

aerith is mentioned in a graffiti in the subway station early in the animated film wreck @-@ it ralph the graffiti reads aerith lives
she has green eyes and long brown hair tied in a braid with a pink ribbon
she wears a long pink dress a bolero jacket and brown hiking boots
the long dress was designed to appear ladylike and as a contrast to tifa lockhart 's miniskirt
during development aerith was supposed to be sephiroth 's sister as both designs resembled each other but they were made former lovers with aerith remembering sephiroth when meeting cloud as both are ex @-@ soldiers
late during development aerith 's first love was changed to zack fair
her green eyes were meant to symbolize nature and also served as another contrast to tifa 's brown eyes
nomura did not change much of aerith 's design for advent children but her design was updated in kingdom hearts with the removal of her bolero jacket which made her attire appear more as amano had originally drawn her
other changes included the addition of bracelets and a belt
nomura modified her dress in before crisis adding white and green colors and this version was also used as the basis for her design in kingdom hearts ii
aerith 's original japanese name is エアリス earisu pronounced eaɽisu ̥
this was transliterated to aeris in final fantasy vii and final fantasy tactics but in later products has been changed to aerith
both transliterations have basis as the japanese su ス is used when transcribing s s and th θ to japanese
however official japanese material uses the spelling aerith and developers have stated that aerith is a near @-@ anagram of earth
prior to the game 's release western gaming magazines such as the may <year> issue of computer and video games also referred to her as aerith
in early planning stages of final fantasy vii aerith was to be one of only three protagonists herself cloud and barret
during a phone call to kitase it was suggested that at some point in the game one of the main characters should die and after much discussion as to whether it should be barret or aerith the producers chose aerith
nomura stated in a <year> electronic gaming monthly interview cloud 's the main character so you can 't really kill him
and barrett
sic well that 's maybe too obvious
while designing final fantasy vii nomura was frustrated with the perennial cliché where the protagonist loves someone very much and so has to sacrifice himself and die in a dramatic fashion to express that love
he found this trope appeared in both films and video games from north america and japan and asked is it right to set such an example to people kitase concluded in the real world things are very different
you just need to look around you
nobody wants to die that way
people die of disease and accident
death comes suddenly and there is no notion of good or bad
it leaves not a dramatic feeling but great emptiness
when you lose someone you loved very much you feel this big empty space and think if i had known this was coming i would have done things differently
these are the feelings i wanted to arouse in the players with aerith 's death relatively early in the game
feelings of reality and not hollywood
according to nomura death should be something sudden and unexpected and aerith 's death seemed more natural and realistic
he said when i reflect on final fantasy vii the fact that fans were so offended by her sudden death probably means that we were successful with her character
if fans had simply accepted her death that would have meant she wasn 't an effective character
from the original release of the game rumors have circulated that aerith can be resurrected in or that the original plan was to have her come back but this was scrapped in development
nomura has categorically stated that neither of these rumors were ever true the world was expecting us to bring her back to life as this is the classic convention
a lengthy petition asking for aerith 's revival by japanese players was sent to kitase but he dismissed it pointing out that there are many meanings in aerith 's death and her revival could never happen
it was composed by famed final fantasy composer nobuo uematsu
the piece flowers blooming in the church is based on it
aerith 's theme is very popular among final fantasy fans and has inspired an orchestral version a piano version and a vocal version performed by the artist rikki who also performed suteki da ne for final fantasy x
a piano arrangement of the theme appears twice in advent children and the track water also echoes shades of the theme the opening phrase of aerith 's theme appears just prior to the climax of the track divinity ii which shortly thereafter includes as its final line the latin phrase sola dea fatum novit only the goddess knows fate and is also featured during the end credits of the film
it also has been reinterpreted on the overclocked remix final fantasy vii compilation voices of the lifestream
in <year> aerith 's theme achieved the third place in the classic fm hall of fame
gamestm referred to her as a gaming legend
rpgamer 's stuart hoggan opined that although aerith represented the token damsel in distress she broke the mould in terms of personality possessing an admirable pluck that was not brassy nor off @-@ putting
in <year> she was included in tom 's games list of top <num> greatest female characters in video game history for her death scene and the beauty of her appearance and personality

heath hooker of gamezone ranked aerith as fifth on his <year> top list of final fantasy characters and wrote she has become an icon in not only the final fantasy series but also in video game history
her relation with cloud has also received positive response including the two being listed in ign 's article about the best video game romances
her death in final fantasy vii has received a great deal of attention
according to gamestm her death helped establish the popularity of final fantasy vii
players commented on message boards and blogs about the emotional impact the scene held
fans submitted a petition to yoshinori kitase requesting her return
gamespy numbers her demise as the <num> greatest cinematic moments in video game history while its readers voted it the second most cinematic moment
gamepro considers her death sequence to be the greatest of all gaming moments
tom 's games called the scene one of the most powerful and memorable scenes of the final fantasy series — or any other game for that matter
edge called her death the dramatic highpoint of final fantasy vii and suggested that reintroducing her through the compilation of final fantasy vii titles arguably undermines this great moment
in <year> electronic gaming monthly listed final fantasy vii number six in their list of ten most important games stating that without this game aeris wouldn 't have died and gamers wouldn 't have learned how to cry
screwattack has added aerith 's death to their top <num> omgwtf moments referring to it as one of the touchiest moments in video game history

cole song forbidden fruit is a song by american hip hop recording artist j
cole
the song was sent to radio stations in august <year> as the third official single from cole 's second studio album born sinner <year>
forbidden fruit was produced by cole himself and features a guest appearance from frequent collaborator and fellow american rapper kendrick lamar who contributes vocals to the song 's hook
the song features a sample of american jazz musician ronnie foster 's mystic brew most recognized from its use on hip hop group a tribe called quest 's electric relaxation
the song was met with mixed reviews from music critics
forbidden fruit would peak at number <num> on the billboard hot r b hip @-@ hop songs chart
cole for his second album born sinner <year>
it was recorded as a replacement for another song which cole was forced to remove from the album 's track listing after failing to obtain sample clearance from the estate of jimi hendrix
the song 's production is based around a looped sample of american jazz musician ronnie foster 's mystic brew which was also famously sampled by hip hop group a tribe called quest on their <year> song electric relaxation
cole was inspired to incorporate the foster sample into forbidden fruit after hearing electric relaxation saying i was like oh man
what if you know what i mean like what if i could just do it my way you know what i mean it 's such a classic and people are so afraid to touch classics
and i was just like what if i could flip it so i just went and found the original sample
american rapper kendrick lamar is featured on forbidden fruit which is the only track on the standard edition of born sinner with a fellow rapper credited as a featured artist
lamar does not rap a verse on the song he instead contributes vocals to its refrain
forbidden fruit contains lyrics referencing born sinner 's release date coinciding with that of yeezus by american rapper kanye west
cole brought out kendrick lamar to perform the song along with the j
cole @-@ produced hiiipower
in june <year> mtv reported that forbidden fruit would be released as the third single from born sinner
on august <num> <year> the song impacted american mainstream urban radio
erin lowers of exclaim cited the song as one of the album 's standout tracks saying that it embodies a silent confidence paying homage to a legendary group while speaking on releasing an album the same day as kanye west bringing born sinner full @-@ circle
julia leconte of now praised cole 's sampling of mystic brew as done exceptionally well and named forbidden fruit the best track from born sinner
david jeffries of allmusic expressed a similar sentiment writing that forbidden fruit is driven by its blue note @-@ inspired backbeats
august brown of the los angeles times gave the song a negative review commenting that kendrick lamar somehow packs more personality into a halfhearted hook on forbidden fruit than cole gets in the song
phillip mlynar of spin felt that the song 's quirky bass line and warm @-@ keys motif are so recognizable that it 's a brow @-@ furrowing challenge to hear anything other than q @-@ tip and phife 's original vocals in the space between the beat and the new raps
mlynar further stated that cole himself along with kendrick lamar 's guest spot ends up evaporating entirely — he 's upstaged by loftier artists who aren 't even there
contrarily ali shaheed muhammad of a tribe called quest expressed his appreciation for cole 's production he didn 't like try to do what was already done

it is among the earliest extant log churches in hampshire county along with capon chapel and mount bethel church
the church was constructed in <year> to serve as a nondenominational union church

the church is believed to have also been a meeting place for german methodist settlers
by <year> the church was primarily used by the brethren denomination and in <year> the church 's congregation split into white pine church of the brethren and old pine church congregations
both congregations continued to use the church until <year>
old pine church reportedly housed a school in the early <num> century while still serving as a center for worship
in <year> residents of the purgitsville community raised the necessary funds to perform a restoration of the church
it was added to the national register of historic places on december <num> <year> due to its significant settlement @-@ era rural religious architecture in the potomac highlands
the church is a large one @-@ story gablefront log building sheathed in brown @-@ painted wooden german siding
the original hewn log beams are visible beneath the church with some bark remaining on the logs
the church 's interior ceiling measures approximately <num> feet <num>
<num> metres in height and is clad in pressed metal panels
several of its pews date from <year>
in the church 's adjoining cemetery the earliest extant gravestone dates from <year> and several unmarked interment sites may exist from as early as <year>
according to architectural historian sandra scaffidi old pine church and cemetery is an excellent example of one of the area 's early rural church complexes
<num> miles <num>
<num> kilometres south of the unincorporated community of purgitsville
the church and cemetery are situated on <num>
<num> acres <num>
<num> hectares atop a bluff to the west of united states route <num> at an elevation of <num> @,@ <num> feet <num> metres
the property is surrounded by old @-@ growth forests
the church is in a rural area of southwestern hampshire county within the mill creek valley

the trough on the south branch potomac river is located across mill creek mountain approximately <num> miles <num>
<num> km to the east of the church
one of these seven supporters thomas colepeper <num> baron colepeper acquired the entire area in <year> his grandson thomas fairfax <num> lord fairfax of cameron inherited it in <year>
the church is in the mill creek valley
as tensions with native americans were beginning to ease lord fairfax sought to entice white settlers to the sparsely settled lands of his northern neck proprietary
the valley was one of the first parts of present @-@ day hampshire county to be settled by whites beginning in the mid @-@ <num> century
settlers were drawn by the valley 's fertility
as the valley 's population grew the unincorporated community of purgitsville developed along mill creek as a trading post village it was named for henry purgitt or purgate who acquired <num> acres <num> ha in the mill creek valley on january <num> <year> and received a further land transfer of <num> acres <num> ha in <year>
purgitsville continued to develop throughout the course of the <num> century during which time it grew to include a small store a post office and a blacksmith shop
on september <num> <year> william pomkrotz and his wife milly deeded a tract of land to a group of trustees charged with constructing a church or house for public worship for the use and convenience of ministers and others of the christians sic denominations whatsoever
while the deed mentioned an existing meeting house on the site there is no extant evidence of a prior structure
according to architectural historian sandra scaffidi no particular christian denomination received sole ownership of the edifice which suggests that the church was intended to serve as a nondenominational union church
the church 's earliest resident minister was reportedly nicholas leatherman whose wife elizabeth high was the daughter of george high one of the church 's original trustees
several christian denominations held meetings at old pine church including the schwarzenau brethren or german baptist brethren which began holding services at the church in the late <num> century
as many of the mill creek valley 's settlers were of german descent the old pine church structure may also have been built as a meeting place for brethren adherents known as dunkers or dunkards
it is believed that old pine church was also used by german methodists
the brethren was a christian denomination of anabaptist origin that practiced baptism by triune immersion and exercised nonresistance
triune immersion consists of dipping a new believer into water three times once for each of the entities of the holy trinity
brethren adherents believed only in the new testament and professed no other creeds
the interior of old pine church which consists of a single common space for all worshippers also illustrates the building 's connection with the brethren and the denomination 's beliefs regarding slavery
according to the minutes from the <year> meeting of the brethren in franklin county virginia it has been unanimously considered that it cannot be permitted in any way by the church that a member should purchase negroes or keep them as slaves
while many residents in hampshire county prior to the american civil war were slaveholders it is thought that brethren adherents in the county did not own slaves or depend upon slave labor
the brethren denomination had been present in the south branch potomac river valley from as early as the <num> although records of early brethren congregations are not extant possibly because they were served by itinerant ministers
as early as <year> two brothers with the surname of powers led a brethren congregation in the area
in dr
emmert f
bittinger 's historical research on the brethren church in hampshire county in his allegheny passage <year> it is noted that the church of the brethren denomination recognized old pine church as belonging to the larger beaver run congregation which was centered approximately <num> miles <num> km south of old pine church
the beaver run congregation was the first organization of the brethren in hampshire county
old pine church and its predecessor structures were probably utilized by members of the beaver run congregation because the distance between the northern region of the valley and the church on beaver run was too great to traverse easily
thus old pine church began as a mission of the beaver run congregation
because of its location in the vicinity of the hardy county boundary line the district served by the church spanned both counties
by <year> old pine church was primarily used by the brethren denomination
around <year> the nicholas congregation of brethren was worshiping at the church and was led by dr
leatherman
according to the beaver run church book membership at old pine church was <num> in <year> and numbered <num> in <year>
the beaver run congregation modified its district 's boundaries in <year> which may have resulted in a division of the congregation at old pine church into two factions white pine church of the brethren and old pine church
both churches continued to worship at old pine church at different times
white pine church of the brethren worshiped at the church from the <num> until the construction of their own church building in <year>
by <year> old pine church remained under collective ownership by several christian denominations although the brethren were the church 's largest shareholders
white pine church of the brethren remained listed in the brethren conference minutes as pine church until <year> when members of the church petitioned the brethren conference to change their name from pine to white pine
old pine church reportedly housed a school in the early <num> century while still serving as a center for worship
a small one @-@ room addition to the church was constructed to the north façade of the building which served as the boarding room for the school 's teacher
the old pine church also continued to be used for funeral services and reunions
the boarding room addition was probably removed nothing of it now remains and the pressed metal ceiling may have been added
regular church services have not taken place in the church since the middle of the <num> century
the church 's adjacent cemetery also continues to be used for burials
throughout its existence old pine church has been known by various names including mill church nicholas church and simply pine church
in <year> the hampshire county historic landmarks commission and the hampshire county commission embarked upon an initiative to place structures and districts on the national register of historic places following a series of surveys of historic properties throughout the county
the county received funding for the surveying and documentation of hampshire county architecture and history from the state historic preservation office of the west virginia division of culture and history
old pine church was one of the first eight historic properties to be considered for placement on the register as a result of the county 's initiative
the other seven properties were capon chapel fort kuykendall hickory grove hook tavern north river mills historic district springfield brick house and valley view
according to hampshire county commission 's compliance officer charles baker places of worship were not typically selected for inclusion in the register old pine church and capon chapel were exceptions because both started out as meeting houses
old pine church was listed on the national register of historic places on december <num> <year> because of its significant settlement @-@ era rural religious architecture in the potomac highlands
its symmetrical front façade faces west and encompasses a main entrance consisting of a double set of four @-@ paneled doors
the main entrance is reached by two concrete steps on either side of which is a modern metal handrail

the original hewn log beams still retaining bark can be seen under the church
the church is covered with brown @-@ painted wooden german siding and is crowned by a modern standing @-@ seam metal roof
architectural historian sandra scaffidi states that the simple form and construction of old pine church are indicative of the early settlers access to materials and are an example of the log construction techniques used in the religious architecture of hampshire county 's earliest settlers
she adds that old pine church is representative of a simple design and form common to the early ecclesiastical buildings and an excellent example of one of the area 's early rural church complexes

it continues to serve as the church 's sole source of heat
several of the church 's pews date from <year> and remain in use
the pews quite simple in form have a minimalist appearance
each pew consists of a long wooden plank that serves as the seat with a thin rail supported by three spindles as the backrest
the pews are supported by three arched supports joined to the seat by a mortise and tenon joint and reinforced with nails
the newer pews exhibit identical design elements but are constructed with modern nails and timber
though most of the pews are arranged against the church 's west elevation with a center aisle two are along the north elevation and four are along the south elevation
the pulpit is situated at the east elevation
there is an upright piano in the northeastern corner of the church
the earliest remaining gravestone dates from <year> but several unmarked interment sites in the surrounding cemetery may date from as early as <year>
the church 's sign along u
s
route <num> erroneously lists the date of the cemetery 's oldest interment sites as <year>
the cemetery 's headstones are oriented both to the east and to the west
the majority are simple in design inscribed with birth and death dates and consist of a combination of rounded arched stones rectangular stones and pyramidal @-@ shaped obelisks that appear to be cut from limestone
in the cemetery 's southern section are several small rectangular stones that probably serve as footstones
beginning around <year> the gravestones erected in the cemetery became more intricate with polished granite surfaces lying atop rough @-@ cut stone foundations
old pine church 's cemetery is surrounded by several mature trees with a large oak tree overhanging the southwestern area of the cemetery
outside of the national register of historic places boundary to the northwest of old pine church lies a second parcel of land acquired around <year> for additional burials
the cemetery is enclosed by a chicken wire fence supported by wooden posts with a large gate to the north of the church which allows machinery access into the cemetery

the minnesota territory itself was formed only in <year> but the area had a rich history well before this
though there was a long history of european presence in the area before <num> century it was during the <num> century that the united states began to establish a firm presence in what would become minnesota
many of the facets of minnesota culture that are perceived as the area 's early history in fact originated after this period
notably the heavy scandinavian immigration for which the state is known and the pioneering days chronicled by author laura ingalls wilder occurred after statehood in the later <num> century
unlike these later years the first half of the <num> century was characterized by sparsely populated communities harsh living conditions and to some degree lawlessness
this era was a period of economic transition
the dominant enterprise in the area since the <num> century had been the fur trade
the dakota sioux and later the ojibwe tribes hunted and gathered pelts trading with french british and later american traders at grand portage mendota and other sites
this trade gradually declined during the early <num> century as demand for furs in europe diminished
the lumber industry grew rapidly replacing furs as the key economic resource
grain production began to develop late during this time as an emerging economic basis as well
saw mills and later grain mills around fort snelling and saint anthony falls in east @-@ central minnesota became magnets for development
by the end of the era east @-@ central minnesota had replaced northern minnesota as the economic center of the area
this era was also as a period of cultural transition
at the time the u
s
took possession of the region native americans were by far the largest ethnic groups
their role in the fur trade gave them a steady stream of income and significant political influence even as the french british and americans asserted territorial claims on the area
french and british traders had mixed with native society in the area for many decades peacefully contributing to the society and creating new ethnic groups consisting of mixed @-@ race peoples
as the americans established outposts in the area and the fur trade declined the dynamics changed dramatically
the economic influence of the native americans diminished and american territorial ideology increasingly sought to limit their influence
large waves of immigration in the <num> very suddenly changed the demographics so that within a few years the population shifted from predominantly native to predominantly people of european descent
the native and mixed @-@ race populations continued to influence the territory 's culture and politics even at the end of the territorial era though by the time statehood was achieved that influence was in steep decline
heavy immigration from new england and new york led to minnesota 's being labeled the new england of the west
having come from a region around maine they were experienced at dealing with european traders
tensions rose between the ojibwe and the santee or eastern dakota sioux who were dominant in the area during the ensuing years
french exploration in minnesota is known have begun in the <num> century with explorers like radisson groseilliers and le sueur
after france signed a treaty with a number of tribes to allow trade in the area french settlements began to appear
trader daniel greysolon sieur du lhut explored the western area of lake superior helping to advance trade and leading to the establishment of fond du lac part of modern duluth which was named after du lhut
roman catholic priest louis hennepin captured by the sioux in <year> while exploring north america with famed explorer la salle discovered and named saint anthony falls
the next account of an expedition into minnesota 's interior was that of captain jonathan carver of connecticut who reached saint anthony falls in <year>
in the later <num> century trader peter pond explored the minnesota river valley noting significant european settlement in the region in addition to the natives
explorers searching for the fabled northwest passage and large inland seas in north america continued to pass through this region
fort beauharnois was built by the french in <year> on lake pepin to facilitate exploration
in the <num> century a lucrative trade developed between native americans who trapped animals near the great lakes and traders who shipped the animal furs to europe
for two centuries this trade network was the prime economic driver in the area
a notable result of this trade network was the métis people a mixed @-@ race community descended from native americans and french traders as well as other mixed @-@ race peoples
in particular during the latter <num> century numerous french and english traders in the minnesota region purchased sioux wives in order to establish kinship relationships with the sioux so as to secure their supply of furs from the tribes
the british hudson 's bay company was formed in <year> to capitalize on the native american fur trade near hudson bay
the company came to dominate the north american trade in the <num> century
the north west company of montreal was formed in <year> to compete with hudson 's bay company establishing their western headquarters and key exchange point at grand portage in what is now minnesota
grand portage with its two wharves and numerous warehouses became one of britain 's four main fur trading posts along with niagara detroit and michilimackinac
british ships crossed lake superior regularly transporting supplies to the region and bringing back valuable furs
even after grand portage became property of the u
s
in <year> the british operations such as north west company and the xy company continued to operate in the area for some time
though the various parts of what is now minnesota were claimed at different times by spain france and britain none of these nations made significant efforts to establish major settlements in the area
instead the french and the british established mostly trading posts and utilized the natives in the area as suppliers
all of the land east of the mississippi river was granted to the united states by the second treaty of paris at the end of the american revolution in <year>
this included what would become modern day saint paul but only part of minneapolis including the northeast north @-@ central and east @-@ central portions of the state
the wording of the treaty in the minnesota area depended on landmarks reported by fur traders who erroneously reported an isle phelipeaux in lake superior a long lake west of the island and the belief that the mississippi river ran well into modern canada
much of this region was claimed by other states who subsequently ceded these to the federal government
most of the remaining areas of what is now the state were purchased in <year> from france as part of the louisiana purchase the area west of the mississippi having been recently acquired by france from spain
parts of northern minnesota were considered to be in rupert 's land a large territory owned by hudson 's bay company
the exact definition of the boundary between minnesota and british north america was not addressed until the anglo @-@ american convention of <year>
until <year> the entire red river valley in what is today southeastern manitoba and northwestern minnesota was considered british and was subject to several colonization schemes by the hudson 's bay company particularly the red river colony also known as the selkirk settlement established in <year>
the valley had in fact been occupied by métis since the middle <num> century
the red river colony established to supply the british fur trade was fraught with problems from the beginning but became important in the minnesota area 's early fur trade as well as supplying many early settlers to the region
though the region 's population was mostly native american there were important british trading posts in the area with many european and mixed @-@ race settlers particularly in the north
grand portage in particular had long been established as the major trading center for the north west company
david thompson a british fur trader for the north west company of montreal completed numerous surveys and maps of the north american frontier
in <year> he completed the first known map of the minnesota area in what was then the northwest territory
the jay treaty however obliged most of the british settlers to withdraw their settlements in <year> though mixed @-@ race peoples remained
in <year> u
s
lieutenant zebulon pike was sent by general wilkinson governor of the louisiana territory to enforce u
s
sovereignty against british traders in the area and establish diplomatic and trading relationships with the native tribes
he met with the sioux leadership in central minnesota to secure rights for the u
s
to an area near saint anthony falls which would later become the city of saint paul
though a treaty was signed by some leaders from the sioux tribes its legitimacy including whether the sioux understood it was dubious and ultimately his efforts did little to establish the authority of the u
s
in the area
in <year> major stephen h
long of the u
s
army corps of engineers led a waterborne expedition from prairie du chien to reach saint anthony falls
he documented much of the terrain today occupied by minneapolis and saint paul as well as the native american villages that existed there at the time
in <year> the <num> parallel was established as the boundary between the united states and british north america
however the point where the red river crossed this line was not marked until <year> when stephen long conducted a survey expedition
the expedition determined among other things that the fur trading post of pembina lay just inside the u
s
border
several efforts were made to determine the source of the mississippi river
in <year> italian explorer giacomo constantino beltrami who had split from the long expedition in pembina found lake julia which he believed was the source of the mississippi river
the actual source was found in <year> when henry schoolcraft was guided by a group of ojibwe headed by ozaawindib yellow head to a lake in northern minnesota
schoolcraft named it lake itasca combining the latin words veritas truth and caput head
in <year> george william featherstonhaugh conducted a geological survey of the minnesota river valley and wrote an account entitled a canoe voyage up the minnay sotor
joseph nicollet scouted the area in the late <num> accompanied by john c
frémont exploring and mapping the upper mississippi river basin the saint croix river and the land between the mississippi and missouri rivers
the forts provided safe shelter for soldiers and explorers on the frontier and a base of operations for expeditions both military and commercial
the first forts in the area had been french particularly fort beauharnois built during the <num> century and later abandoned because of the french and indian war with the british
british fort charlotte at grand portage became essential to the fur trade protecting and supplying british traders as well as the area natives
this british fort operated in the area illegally until <year> even after the area 's becoming recognized as part of the united states
other french and british fortifications such as fort st
charles had existed in the region but had been abandoned much earlier
in <year> the u
s
government built fort shelby later rebuilt as fort crawford near modern minnesota in what is now prairie du chien wisconsin
fort crawford would play a significant role in u
s
involvement in minnesota particularly as the site of the treaty of prairie du chien
the first major u
s
military presence inside the boundaries of modern minnesota was fort saint anthony later renamed fort snelling after the fort 's commander josiah snelling
the land for the fort at the confluence of the minnesota and mississippi rivers had been acquired in <year> by legendary explorer zebulon pike
when concerns mounted about the fur trade in the area construction of the fort began in <year> and was completed in <year>
one of the missions of the fort was to mediate disputes between the ojibwe and the dakota tribes
lawrence taliaferro an agent of the u
s
bureau of indian affairs who became an important figure in these mediations spent <num> years at the fort finally resigning in <year>
fort ripley was built in <year> – <year> in central minnesota near modern little falls
it was built to provide a military presence on the frontier near the new winnebago reservation created as the tribe was moved from iowa
in addition it helped to serve as a buffer between the dakota sioux and the ojibwe
fort ridgely was built in <year> – <year> near the dakota reservation in southwestern minnesota near modern new ulm
it was named by u
s
secretary of war jefferson davis in honor of three army officers named ridgely who had died in the mexican @-@ american war
the fort was created to watch over the minnesota river valley in addition to the larger frontier
it replaced fort doge in iowa which was decommissioned during the same period
the fort operated as a military post until <year>
fort abercrombie was built in <year> on the red river at what is now the border between minnesota and north dakota near modern mccauleyville
the fort had to be moved soon afterward because of flooding problems
it was created to spur settlement of the red river valley protect steamboat traffic on the river and protect wagon trains travelling to montana
in addition to these military bases private companies operated numerous trading posts in the region that were often referred to as forts though they typically had little in the way of defensive fortifications
the two groups fought bitter territorial wars during the <num> century
in the mid @-@ <num> century the battle of kathio in which the ojibwe defeated the sioux permanently established northeastern minnesota particularly mille lacs lake as ojibwe territory relegating the sioux to southern and western minnesota
skirmishes between the groups continued in the <num> century including a battle near lac traverse in <year> a battle near stillwater in <year> the site became known as battle hollow and another on the yellow medicine river in <year>
during the war of <year> most of the dakota and ojibwe sided with the british though at various times some aided the americans or took the opportunity to attack enemy tribes a notable american loyalist was the dakota chief tamaha or rising moose an admirer of pike who joined the u
s
army at saint louis
though grand portage was the only part of minnesota that saw significant conflict during the war natives throughout the region were recruited to fight further east in areas such as green bay
in particular the half @-@ dakota british captain joseph renville heavily recruited among the mdewakanton branch of the dakota sioux including chiefs little crow and wapasha
from <year> to <year> employees of the hudson 's bay company and the north west company engaged in various territorial conflicts known as the fur trade wars including the famous battle of seven oaks at what is now winnipeg manitoba
as a result of these conflicts numerous métis migrated from the red river area to central and eastern minnesota particularly in the vicinity of saint paul
this red river exodus became a major source of francophone immigration into minnesota during the territorial era
the métis and other mixed @-@ race groups were often regarded as french canadian whites rather than indians
by the <num> animal resources were in decline in the area leading to increased competition among the tribes for game and for furs to sell
collusion among the fur trading companies led to a dramatic drop in fur prices during the late <num> causing impoverishment for many sioux hunters
the u
s
government strongly encouraged the tribes to turn from hunting to farming trading the woodlands for the plains
increasing territorial conflict between the sioux and the ojibwe on the western frontier particularly along the mississippi river led the u
s
government to attempt to mediate the conflicts
president andrew jackson 's policy toward the tribes ultimately was to either pacify them sufficiently to allow westward expansion of american settlers or else remove the tribes from the areas in which they prevented settlement
the first treaty of prairie du chien <year> among its provisions established southern minnesota as well as much of modern north and south dakota as the homeland of the dakota sioux
the ojibwe were given northern minnesota and much of wisconsin
the u
s
government though failed to enforce the treaty agreements leading to little crow 's pronouncement to indian agent taliaferro in <year> we made peace to please you but if we are badly off we must blame you for causing us to give up so much of our lands to our enemies
following an <year> treaty the winnebago tribes of iowa were relocated to the long prairie reservation in central minnesota in the late <num> establishing an important presence in the territory
because of the poor land in the new reservation the tribe subsequently negotiated a treaty in <year> allowing them to relocate further south to blue earth but ceding substantial land in the process
all of the native tribes experienced gradual disillusionment with the u
s
government because of its inability or unwillingness to honor its treaty commitments
the major leaders among the tribes were wabasha and little crow among the dakota sioux flat mouth and hole @-@ in @-@ the @-@ day among the ojibwe and winneshiek among the winnebago
the success of treaty negotiations between the u
s
and the tribes was in great part facilitated by the mixed race families such as the faribaults and the renvilles
the treaty of traverse des sioux in <year> gave all of the wahpeton and sisseton sioux upper sioux lands west of the mississippi river to the u
s
government
the treaty of mendota that same year ceded the mdewakanton and wahpekute sioux lower sioux lands in southern minnesota requiring relocation to an area near modern morton
both treaties however were amended to during the ratification process to eliminate the explicit guarantees of lands retained by the tribes
additionally much of the promised payments were never delivered in part ostensibly because of debts owed by the sioux to the fur traders
despite american hunger for land the leadership in the minnesota territory did not actually want to remove the sioux from the territory
federal subsidies to the tribes were heavily siphoned by the u
s
settlements and removal of the tribes from the territory would have meant loss of this income
increasing impoverishment among the sioux and continued treaty violations on the part of the united states would soon lead to bloodshed
in <year> a renegade band of sioux led by war chief inkpaduta attacked the community of spirit lake iowa near the minnesota border killing between <num> and <num> white settlers the event would be referred to as the spirit lake massacre
they went on to attack springfield minnesota modern jackson killing seven before being turned back
in <year> bands of sioux launched the dakota war in which they were defeated
apart from those killed in the war <num> dakota sioux were killed in a mass execution in mankato the largest mass execution in the u
s
history
hundreds more sioux and european @-@ americans were killed in the u
s
government 's subsequent eradication of the sioux nation in minnesota and the new dakota territory
at the beginning of the <num> century two british companies competed for dominance in the north american trade hudson 's bay company and the north west company
the north west company had used grand portage as its western headquarters along with other smaller companies that operated in the area
grand portage was one of the four principal british trading and shipping points furs in north america
following the treaty of paris in <year> british operations at grand portage were technically illegal though the trade continued
however beginning in <year> the north west company began re @-@ establishing its headquarters north of the border at the newly constructed fort william in what is now ontario
after <year> grand portage had been reduced to a minor trading center and most traders eventually abandoned the area
in <year> the hudson bay company which had by then absorbed the north west company shipped out a final band of ojibwe who were employed by the company
before <year> the majority of the fur trading posts in the minnesota area were owned by the north west company but by <year> the american fur company founded in <year> by john jacob astor in new york had taken over most of these
as well as grand portage another significant fur shipping point in minnesota was fort frances in the rainy lake region near modern international falls in the far north of the state
this location became significant as it was key to multiple waterways for shipping furs to the atlantic
both the north west company and the american fur company had posts at this location
pembina originally part of the red river colony was a significant trading post for the hudson 's bay company and once it was claimed by the u
s
became for a time key to u
s
interests in the fur trade
by <year> american fur dominated the trade within the united states because of the exclusion of british companies by the u
s
government
beginning in the <num> a fur trading route developed between the red river colony in modern manitoba and the trading posts in minnesota first primarily at mendota and later at saint paul
the system of ox cart trails came to be known as the red river trails and was used principally by the métis as a way to avoid the fur trade monopoly of the hudson 's bay company which had absorbed the north west company
though this cross @-@ border trade was entirely illegal and violated the policies of the hudson 's bay company enforcement against the trade by american and british authorities was virtually non @-@ existent
the trail system would reach its peak usage in the mid @-@ <num> century
the hudson 's bay company continued to expand its presence north of the u
s
border establishing new posts such as fort alexander and rat portage
the fur trade was in decline by the late <num>
the american fur company went bankrupt in <year> though the missouri fur company and other operations kept the trade from collapsing entirely
as this trade declined the lumber industry began to grow substantially in areas such as the saint croix valley where valuable white pine was plentiful
new saw mills appeared in marine and stillwater
lumber was typically cut during winter and sent downstream in the spring
in <year> businessman franklin steele built the first private sawmill on the saint anthony falls which would later become the town of saint anthony opening commercial lumbering on the mississippi river
more sawmills quickly followed
soon the saint croix and mississippi rivers in minnesota had become major conduits for lumber headed for saint louis and other destinations
the first flour mill in minnesota was built in <year> at fort snelling as a retrofitting of a lumber mill
the first private grain mill was built in washington county by samuel bowles
minneapolis gained its first grain mill in <year>
during the <num> grain production began to develop rapidly but minnesota did not become a significant grain exporter until <year>
in <year> the first steamboat known as the virginia arrived at fort snelling carrying indian agent lawrence taliaferro
by the <num> a steady if not yet large stream of steamboat traffic plied the river including some ships listed as ferrying pleasure parties
the first railroad to reach the mississippi in illinois the rock island railroad was completed in the <year>
the event was celebrated with sightseeing excursions from rock island up the mississippi into minnesota
those excursions touched off such a wave of interest in minnesota that <num> @,@ <num> tourists visited saint paul by steamboat in <year>
in <year> james goodhue began publication of the minnesota pioneer newspaper in saint paul the paper would later be renamed the st
paul pioneer press
by the time the area achieved statehood <num> newspapers had been established
information about minnesota published in these periodicals spread throughout the united states and europe
advertising campaigns were launched in the northeastern u
s
and europe to lure european settlers
these efforts met with limited success though they would become much more successful after statehood
saint anthony with its scenic waterfalls rapidly developed as a destination for tourists traveling the mississippi on steamboats
the winslow house a luxury hotel overlooking the falls was constructed in <year>
by the late <num> saint anthony had become a popular summer resort for wealthy southerners
one of the major sources of income in the territory during the <num> was u
s
government annuity payments to the ojibwe and other tribes required by earlier treaties
these payments amounted to more than <num> @,@ <num> per year on average <num>
<num> million in present @-@ day terms compared to approximately <num> @,@ <num> per year <num>
<num> million in present @-@ day terms given to the territory itself for development
because of corruption and mishandling of the payments to the tribes a great deal of the money was used directly by u
s
settlers for commercial and community development with questionable benefit to the tribes
at the beginning of the minnesota territory in fact these payments were the territory 's most important source of income since the fur trade was no longer as lucrative as it had once been and other exports were still negligible
s
settlers in what is now minnesota
significant dakota sioux settlements in the minnesota area included kaposia located in what is now saint paul before being moved by the <year> treaty
significant ojibwe settlements included misizaaga 'igan mille lacs and nagaajiwanaang fond du lac as well as the community that had developed around the grand portage commerce
when the minnesota territory was established in <year> the native american settlements in the territory still rivaled the american settlements in size
according to some scholars the mandan hidatsa village of like @-@ a @-@ fishhook in what is now north dakota with a population of <num> was the largest settlement in the minnesota territory
the numerous other settlements in the territory gave a total native american population of over <num> @,@ <num> in <year> which easily outnumbered the <num> white settlers
at the outset of the <num> century most of the european settlements were related to the fur trade
the largest of these settlements were trading posts established by the north west company particularly those at sandy lake leech lake and fond du lac
historian grace lee nute has documented over <num> fur trading posts of varying sizes in the minnesota area before statehood
most of these posts were eventually taken over by the american fur company
when several hundred settlers abandoned the red river colony in the <num> they entered the united states by way of the red river valley instead of moving to eastern canada or returning to europe adding to the minnesota region 's population
construction on fort snelling began in <year> and was finished in <year>
the fort became a magnet for settlement in east @-@ central minnesota
nearby mendota was established during the same period and as the regional headquarters for the american fur company also drew settlement in the area soon becoming minnesota 's commercial center
many of the first stone buildings in the territory were constructed in mendota by employees of the american fur company which bought animal pelts at that location from <year> to <year>
the logging industry spurred further development of settlements
before railroads lumbermen relied mostly on river transportation to bring logs to market which made minnesota 's timber resources attractive
towns like marine on saint croix founded as marine mills and stillwater became significant lumber centers fed by the saint croix river while winona was supplied lumber by areas in southern minnesota and along the minnesota river
in the <num> a group of squatters mostly métis from the ill @-@ fated red river colony established a camp near the fort
because of complaints from some residents at the fort new restrictions were placed on the squatters forcing them to move down the mississippi river first to a site known as fountain cave and then even further downriver
pierre pig 's eye parrant a popular moonshiner among the group established a saloon at the new site and the squatters named their settlement pig 's eye after parrant later changing the name to lambert 's landing and finally saint paul after the local chapel
the location was a convenient site for a steamboat landing and by <year> a steamboat line had established the town as a regular stop
this attractive advantage for commerce caused the settlement to develop significantly soon eroding mendota 's prominence
the sutler general store operator at fort snelling franklin steele who had established lumbering interests in the area staked a claim to lands adjacent to saint anthony falls following the land cessions of the <year> objibwe treaty
in <year> he built a sawmill at the falls establishing the basis of the town of saint anthony which grew there
john h
stevens an employee of franklin steele pointed out that land on the west side of the falls would make a good site for future mills
since the land on the west side was still part of the military reservation stevens made a deal with fort snelling 's commander
stevens would provide free ferry service across the river in exchange for a tract of <num> acres <num>
<num> km2 at the head of the falls
stevens received the claim and built a house the first house in minneapolis in <year>
later in <year> stevens platted the city of minneapolis on the west bank
in <year> the first bridge across the main channel of the mississippi anywhere in the nation was built between minneapolis and saint anthony
by <year> treaties between native american tribes and the u
s
government had opened much of minnesota to u
s
settlement
fort snelling was no longer a frontier outpost
efforts to establish minnesota as a prominent future state in the union were swift
in <year> territorial legislature petitioned the u
s
congress for land to build a railroad between milwaukee wisconsin and saint paul
that same year the legislature incorporated the university of minnesota and established its endowment though the university would not admit students until many years later
in <year> when the minnesota territory was formed there were four major white settlements saint paul saint anthony part of modern minneapolis stillwater and pembina now part of north dakota
new settlements began to appear more rapidly
mankato was established in <year> by entrepreneurs jackson johnson and williams
saint peter was established in <year> by captain william bigelow dodd
new ulm was established in <year> by german immigrants
rochester was established by george head in <year>
not all of the new settlements were established by immigrants from the eastern u
s
and europe though
the town of faribault for example was established in <year> by alexander faribault a minnesota native of mixed french @-@ canadian dakota ancestry
the influx of settlers in the <num> transformed minnesota from a sparsely populated territory of less than <num> @,@ <num> white settlers and a significantly larger native population to a substantial population center of over <num> @,@ <num> predominantly european settlers
the city of saint paul expanded from less than <num> people in <year> to over <num> in <year> and over <num> @,@ <num> in <year>
as a result of heavy immigration from new england and new york — regions where most major towns had originated as trading centers rather than political or manufacturing centers — many new settlements in minnesota were laid out so as to heavily favor the business districts rather than the city halls or courthouses
this plan and the philosophy behind it spurred the growth of economic links between the communities and with other parts of the u
s
in <year> the minnesota territory established its first commissioner of emigration eugene burnand
through advertisements and speeches to new immigrants to the u
s
in new york burnand expanded the immigration trend which later created a large german community after statehood
nevertheless the division between indian and white during this era was always somewhat vague
in general persons of mixed descent were considered white if they dressed in european clothing and adopted european customs
indians were those who lived in traditional native lifestyles
even as the u
s
began to establish its authority over the region and some settlers from the u
s
began to arrive the native american population continued to hold significant political and social influence as a result of the fur trade
as experienced hunters they were important to one of north america 's major business enterprises
the decline of this trade during the later part of the era marked the decline of native american influence
following the <year> treaty the saint croix triangle between the saint croix and mississippi rivers had been opened to u
s
settlement
still until the later establishment of the minnesota territory this triangle remained an island of white culture and settlement
the vast majority of the minnesota area though was indian country
contemporary accounts of larger towns such as mendota saint anthony and saint paul in the <num> indicate that the majority of the population was predominantly of french and métis ancestry
even in these communities european culture was not strictly dominant
commenting on minnesota 's culture of the <num> governor alexander ramsey described the streets of saint paul saying that it was common to see the blankets and painted faces of indians and the red sashes and mocassins of french voyageurs and half @-@ breeds greatly predominating over the less picturesque costume of the anglo @-@ american race
it is in fact likely that a very large percentage of the white population reported in the <year> census was of partially native american ancestry
many men of mixed racial ancestry became respected members of white society
william w
warren for example was the son of an american entrepreneur who hailed from new york before he began working in john jacob astor 's american fur company and a mixed @-@ blood ojibwe mother whose father had been in the old french and british fur trade was educated in the east and in the early <num> lived on the upper mississippi in part working as an independent translator and indian agency contractor
warren was a good writer — his newspaper articles were eventually published as the only <num> century compendium of ojibwe history and was elected to the territorial legislature before his death from consumption
with the establishment of the minnesota territory in <year> and the treaty of <year> waves of immigrants from the u
s
and europe came to the territory rapidly changing the demographics
even as these changes occurred in many areas the vagueness of the racial divisions between indians and whites persisted
as late as <year> it was common practice in some jurisdictions for men to be allowed to vote based on whether or not they were wearing european clothing
according to some observers natives at a given polling location would share a single pair of trousers each wearing them only long enough to cast a ballot
logging and trading communities in the territory such as international falls were often known as centers of lawlessness and vice
saloons were commonly the social centers of the towns with brothels and bath houses adding to the character of the society
these gathering places attracted trappers traders smugglers and numerous others traveling through the countryside
the late <num> and <num> witnessed large @-@ scale immigration from the eastern u
s
and europe
by <year> approximately <num> percent of minnesota 's u
s
-born population came from new york and new england
the state was in fact for a time known as the new england of the west
maine in particular contributed a large number of immigrants probably because of the large number of lumbermen in maine and the growing lumber industry in minnesota
by the <num> racist ideology which was becoming prevalent in much of the u
s
began to affect minnesota more significantly than it had in the past
the ruling class was composed of primarily anglo @-@ american protestants
settlers from the u
s
increasingly discussed white inhabitants as the key to minnesota 's future with an eye toward marginalizing the role that other inferior races would have in the future
author james wesley bond in <year> described minnesota before the <num> as a waste of woodland and prairie uninhabited save by the different hordes of savage tribes from time immemorial
prejudices in the territory however were complicated
as late as <year> mulattos in saint paul were commonly treated as equals to others in the community with children of all races attending the same schools
by the late <num> however all blacks had been completely disenfranchised
in addition they were prevented from running for office and their children were segregated in schools
by contrast irish catholics and native americans who adopted european lifestyles were allowed to vote and their children were not segregated in the classrooms
paradoxically whereas anglo @-@ americans generally accepted business development by african americans they largely opposed business development by irish immigrants
minnesota was a multi @-@ lingual area throughout the era
during the earlier parts of the era french and english were widely used but ojibwe sioux and michif the language of the métis were more widespread
by the late <num> english had grown to be the most spoken language
new immigrants though brought additional languages to the territory
newspapers were published in german die minnesota deutsche zeitung swedish minnesota posten and norwegian folkets rost
irish gaelic czech and other languages were used in various communities as well
most of the population of the region in earlier decades followed traditional tribal religious practices
however roman catholicism had been known in the area long before its acquisition by the u
s
because of the many french traders who lived and intermarried there
catholic missionary activity among the métis expanded greatly in the early <num> century with the catholic church becoming particularly established in saint paul
protestantism was rather a much newer phenomenon though some protestant missionaries had entered the region in the early <num> century as well
the first protestant church appeared in <year> market street church saint paul
the waves of immigration in the <num> however would rapidly make prostestants the largest religious group
the ordinance specifically stated there shall be neither slavery nor involuntary servitude in the said territory otherwise than in the punishment of crime whereof the party shall have been duly convicted
the ordinance was nevertheless seen as ambiguous in that it did not specifically address the slaves already in the territories and it discussed the free population of the territories seemingly implying that a slave population would exist
french traders in the territories and later even american army officers including josiah snelling who commanded his namesake fort continued to hold slaves with the blessings of many in congress
the number of african americans in the territory during this period was quite small but not insignificant
newcomers continued to bring slaves with them but there were many free blacks as well some working as servants and some as completely independent pioneers
information about the black immigrants during the earlier periods is sparse but records do show that most of those at fort snelling were slaves
records from <year> indicate a population of <num> free blacks out of a total population of <num> @,@ <num> citizens in the territory which excluded native american tribes
before the <num> these free persons could often expect to be treated equal to other racial groups
by the time minnesota had achieved statehood however blacks had been disenfranchised and schools were segregated
despite this from the start of the minnesota territory in <year> the leadership was predominantly antislavery thus ending the practice in this era
one of the most famous of the early african americans in the territory was george bonga
he was born in minnesota in <year> his father pierre bonga the son of a freed slave and his mother a member of the ojibwe tribe
bonga was schooled in montreal and eventually became a fur trader in the northwest territories
he went on to serve as an interpreter in negotiations with the ojibwe particularly as a representative of michigan governor lewis cass
his brother stephen served as the ojibwe interpreter at fort snelling for the <year> treaty
in the <num> fort snelling played a key role in the infamous dred scott court case
slaves dred scott and his wife were taken to the fort by their master john emerson
they lived at the fort and elsewhere in territories where slavery was prohibited
after emerson 's death the scotts argued that since they had lived in free territory they were no longer slaves
ultimately in <year> the u
s
supreme court sided against the scotts
this decision helped to fuel rancor over slavery leading to the bleeding kansas conflicts the panic of <year> and eventually the american civil war
the mississippi river had divided the eastern british french lands of north america from the western spanish lands and even after the louisiana purchase this was for a time seen as a separation between territories
the division between the u
s
territories in the region and the british territories remained ambiguous until the anglo @-@ american convention of <year> which set the border with british north america at the <num> parallel west of the lake of the woods except for a small chunk of land now dubbed the northwest angle
border disputes east of the lake of the woods continued until the webster @-@ ashburton treaty of <year>
throughout the first half of the <num> century the northeastern portion of the state was a part of the northwest territory formed in <year>
after ohio 's statehood the area became part of the new illinois territory in <year>
after illinois statehood the area was incorporated into the michigan territory in <year> and later became part of the wisconsin territory in <year>
the western and southern areas of the state were not formally organized until <year> when they became part of the iowa territory
following the admission of wisconsin as a state in <year> the minnesota area was temporarily without a government though john catlin the former secretary of the wisconsin territory claimed governorship of what remained of the territory as a short @-@ term measure
by this time minnesota 's residents were largely democrats and as the u
s
congress was at that time controlled by democrats they hoped congress might be sympathetic to their concerns
in that same year a meeting was held in stillwater nominally led by caitlin and later known as the stillwater convention to discuss establishing a new territory
the participants elected henry sibley as a representative to congress
stephen a
douglas d the chair of the united states senate committee on territories drafted the bill authorizing the minnesota territory in <year>
he had envisioned a future for the upper mississippi valley so he was motivated to keep the area from being carved up by neighboring territories
in <year> he had prevented iowa from including fort snelling and saint anthony falls within its northern border
in <year> he kept the organizers of wisconsin from including saint paul and saint anthony falls
the minnesota territory was established from the lands remaining from iowa territory and wisconsin territory on march <num> <year>
the minnesota territory extended far into what is now north dakota and south dakota to the missouri river
there was a dispute over the shape of the state to be carved out of minnesota territory
an alternate proposal that was only narrowly defeated would have made the <num> parallel the state 's northern border and the missouri river its western border thus giving up the whole northern half of the state in exchange for the eastern half of what later became south dakota
alexander ramsey w became the first governor of minnesota territory and henry hastings sibley d became the territorial delegate to the united states congress
henry m
rice d who replaced sibley as the territorial delegate in <year> worked in congress to promote minnesota interests
he lobbied for the construction of a railroad connecting saint paul and lake superior with a link from saint paul to the illinois central railroad
however as discussion of a potential transcontinental railroad in the u
s
became serious leaders in minnesota recognized that a territory was in a weak position to lobby for this economic opportunity
in december <year> rice brought forward two bills in congress an enabling act that would allow minnesota to form a state constitution and a railroad land grant bill
the enabling act defined a state containing both prairie and forest lands with the boundaries drawn as they are today
the bid for statehood came at a time when north @-@ south tensions in the u
s
were rising tensions that would later lead to the american civil war
debate over admitting minnesota as a free state was heated but the enabling act was finally passed on february <num> <year>
a constitutional convention was assembled in the territory in july <year>
divisions between republicans and democrats led to the drafting of two separate constitutions
the larger cities of saint paul saint anthony and stillwater were the domain of the democrats whereas agrarian southern minnesota was the domain of the republicans
a single constitution was finally worked out between the two factions though the more powerful democrats ultimately prevailed on most issues
the resentment between the two parties remained so acrimonious that two separate copies of the constitution had to be used so that members of each party did not have to sign a copy signed by members of the other party
the copies were signed on august <num> <year> and an election was called on october <num> <year> to approve the document
<num> @,@ <num> voters approved the constitution while <num> rejected it
the state constitution was sent to the united states congress for ratification in december <year>
the approval process was drawn out for several months while congress debated over issues that had stemmed from the kansas @-@ nebraska act
once questions surrounding kansas were settled the bill for minnesota 's admittance was passed
the eastern half of the minnesota territory under the boundaries defined by henry mower rice became the country 's <num> state on may <num> <year>
the western part remained unorganized until its incorporation into the dakota territory on march <num> <year>
the story was based on ojibwe legends carried back east by other explorers and traders particularly those collected by henry rowe schoolcraft
joseph rolette also known as jolly joe was a fur trader and territorial legislator of partially métis mixed french native american ancestry who became an iconic figure known in minnesota history for his irreverence
his most famous escapade was one in which following the passage of a bill in <year> which would have moved the territorial capital from saint paul to saint peter rolette absconded with the bill preventing it from becoming law
this and other stories were passed down for generations making rolette as much a legend as a historical figure
the gopher state moniker by which the state today is widely known was selected in the mid @-@ <num> century as a means to create an identity for the state
though some believed that beaver state should be selected instead as more dignified a political cartoon featuring a gopher soon solidified gopher state as the more well @-@ known identity
he was also known as count combat or conde koma in spanish and portuguese a nickname he picked up in spain in <year>
along with antônio soshihiro satake another naturalized brazilian he pioneered judo in brazil the united kingdom and other countries
maeda was fundamental to the development of brazilian jiu @-@ jitsu including through his teaching of carlos gracie and others of the gracie family
he was also a promoter of japanese emigration to brazil
maeda won more than <num> @,@ <num> professional fights in his career
his accomplishments led to him being called the toughest man who ever lived and being referred to as the father of brazilian jiu @-@ jitsu
he attended kenritsu itiu high school currently hirokou — a hirosaki school
as a child he was known as hideyo
he practiced sumo as a teenager but lacked the ideal build for the sport
because of the interest generated by stories about the success of judo at contests between judo and jujutsu that were occurring at the time he changed from sumo to judo
in <year> at seventeen years of age his parents sent him to tokyo to enroll in waseda university
he took up kodokan judo the following year
he was spotted by judo 's founder kano jigoro and assigned to tsunejiro tomita <num> dan at the time the smallest of the teachers of the kodokan 's shiten @-@ no to illustrate that in judo size is not important
tomita was the first kodokan judoka and a close friend of kano
according to koyasu masao <num> dan although the weakest of kodokan shiten @-@ no tomita was able to defeat the great jujutsu champion of that time hansuke nakamura from the tenjin shin 'yō @-@ ryū style
with soishiro satake maeda formed the head of the second generation of kodokan judoka which had replaced the first by the beginning of the <num> century
satake at <num> cm and <num> kg was unmatched in amateur sumo but admitted that he himself was not able to match maeda in judo
satake would later travel to south america with maeda and settle in manaus amazonas state while maeda continued traveling
satake would become the founder in <year> of the first historically registered judo academy in brazil
he and maeda are considered the pioneers of judo in brazil
at that time there were few graduated kodokan judoka
maeda and satake were the top graduated professors at waseda university both sandan <num> dan along with matsuhiro ritaro nidan or <num> dan and six other shodan 1st dan
kyuzo mifune registered at the kodokan in <year> and attracted the attention of maeda who commented you are strong and competent therefore you will certainly leave your mark in the kodokan
mifune went to learn under sakujiro yokoyama and later already a celebrated judoka mifune said that maeda 's words were a great incentive as he regarded maeda with the greatest admiration even though yokoyama was his sensei instructor
according to mifune in <year> maeda lost to yoshitake yoshio by hane goshi after defeating three adversaries in succession but in a following tsukinami @-@ shiai defeated eight adversaries in a row and was awarded the rank of <num> dan yondan
mifune also states that maeda was one of the most vigorous promoters of judo although not by teaching the art instead generating recognition of judo through his many combats with contenders from other disciplines
maeda treated experienced and inexperienced students alike throwing them as if in real combat
he reasoned that this behavior was a measure of respect towards his students but it was often misunderstood and frightened many youngsters who would abandon him in favor of other professors
grant the former president of the united states visited japan
while in tokyo he attended a jujutsu presentation at shibusawa eiichi 's home in asukayama
kano jigoro was one of the jujutsuka present
at that time jujutsu was just starting to become known in europe and the americas
excepting literal circus acts few non @-@ japanese had much chance of seeing or learning about the art
even in japan judo and jujutsu were not considered separate disciplines at that time
indeed it was not until <year> that there started to be clear differentiation of the names in japan and outside japan judo and jujutsu were not completely separated until the <num>
in <year> a senior kodokan instructor named yamashita yoshiaki traveled to the united states at the request of the seattle businessman sam hill
in washington dc yamashita 's students included theodore roosevelt and other prominent americans
at roosevelt 's request yamashita also taught judo at the us naval academy
capitalizing on the publicity the japanese legation in the usa asked the kodokan to send more judo teachers to america providing continuity to yamashita 's work
tomita reluctantly accepted the task maeda and satake embraced the opportunity
early in <year> tomita and maeda gave several public demonstrations of judo
on february <num> <year> tomita and maeda gave a demonstration at princeton university when maeda threw n
b
tooker a princeton football player while tomita threw samuel feagles the princeton gymnasium instructor
on february <num> <year> they gave a judo demonstration at the united states military academy at west point where tomita and maeda performed kata patterns — nage @-@ no koshiki ju @-@ no and so on
at the request of the crowd maeda wrestled a cadet and threw him easily
because tomita had been the thrower in the kata the cadets wanted to wrestle him too
tomita threw the first charles daly without any trouble
however tomita twice failed to throw another football player named tipton using tomoe @-@ nage stomach throw
afterwards the new york sportswriters claimed the victory for the cadets because tomita was thrown whereas the japanese embassy staff proclaimed that tomita had achieved a moral victory on the grounds that he was a far smaller man
a conflicting account provided by the new york times on february <num> referring to tomita as prof
tomet states that in any event later that year the us military academy hired a former world champion professional wrestler tom jenkins instead of a judo teacher a job jenkins kept until his retirement in <year>
the japanese experts did better at the new york athletic club on march <num> <year> their best throw was a sort of flying cartwheel said an article in the new york times describing maeda 's match with john naething a <num> lb wrestler
because of the difference in methods the two men rolled about the mat like schoolboys in a rough @-@ and @-@ tumble fight
after fifteen minutes of wrestling maeda secured the first fall
ultimately however naething was awarded the match by pin fall
on march <num> <year> tomita and maeda gave a jiu @-@ do demonstration at columbia university attended by about <num> people
following introductions tomita demonstrated falls and throws then maeda threw the university 's wrestling instructor
according to the student newspaper another interesting feature was the exhibition of some of the obsolete jiu jitsu tricks for defense with a fan against an opponent armed with the curved japanese sword
translations were provided by chemist takamine jokichi
during april <year> tomita and maeda started a judo club in a commercial space at <year> broadway in new york
members of this club included japanese expatriates plus a european american woman named wilma berger
on july <num> <year> tomita and maeda gave a judo exhibition at the ymca in newport rhode island
on september <num> <year> they gave a demonstration at another ymca in lockport new york
in lockport the local opponent was mason shimer who wrestled tomita unsuccessfully
on november <num> <year> maeda was reported visiting professional wrestler akitaro ono in asheville north carolina after this maeda was no longer routinely associated with tomita in the us newspapers
on december <num> <year> maeda was in atlanta georgia for a professional wrestling match with sam marburger
the contest was best of three two falls with jackets and one without and maeda won the two with jackets and lost the one without
according to the atlanta papers maeda listed his residence as the ymca in selma alabama
maeda was fond of the name and started using it to promote his art thereafter
from paris he went to havana arriving there on december <num> <year> and his twice @-@ a @-@ day wrestling act quickly proved to be very popular
on july <num> <year> maeda left havana for mexico city
his debut in mexico city took place at the virginia fabregas theater on july <num> <year>
this show was a private demonstration for some military cadets
shortly afterwards maeda began appearing at the principal theater
his standing offer was <num> pesos us <num> to anyone he could not throw and <num> pesos us <num> to anyone who could throw him
the mexican herald did not record anyone taking his money
during september <year> a japanese calling himself nobu taka arrived in mexico city for the purpose of challenging maeda for what the mexican herald said would be the world jujutsu championship
after several months of public wrangling taka and maeda met at the colon theater on november <num> <year> taka won
there was an immediate rematch and four days later maeda was pronounced the champion
it was later revealed that taka was in fact maeda 's old friend soishiro satake
in january <year> maeda took part in a wrestling tournament in mexico city
during the semifinals maeda drew with hjalmar lundin
this is a different result than lundin recalled in his <year> memoirs
said lundin having been accustomed to handling the big greco @-@ roman wrestlers with ease the jap thought he could do likewise with me but in the first encounter i got the better of him after which my confidence returned
i had no trouble then in winning the match
it was a surprise to the crowd and a set @-@ back for koma
he had been the hero all week but as soon as he was beaten the fans true to form called him a bum
in july <year> maeda returned to cuba where he tried to arrange matches with frank gotch and jack johnson
the americans ignored him — there was no money to be made wrestling him and much money to be lost if they lost to him
on august <num> <year> maeda wrestled jack connell in havana the result was a draw
during <year> maeda and satake were joined in cuba by akitaro ono and tokugoro ito
the four men were known as the four kings of cuba
the four kings were very popular in cuba and the japanese media were proud of the reputation they were bringing to judo and japan
consequently on january <num> <year> the kodokan promoted maeda to <num> dan
there was some resistance to this decision because there were those in japan who did not approve of his involvement in professional wrestling
in <year> tokugoro ito stayed in cuba while maeda and satake went to el salvador costa rica honduras panama colombia ecuador and peru
in el salvador the president was assassinated while maeda was there and in panama the americans tried to pay him to lose in response they kept moving south
in peru they met laku a japanese jujutsuka who taught the military and invited him to join them
they were then joined by okura in chile and by shimitsu in argentina
the troupe arrived in brazil on november <num> <year>
after appearing in porto alegre maeda and his companions moved throughout the country on august <num> <year> maeda satake okura shimitsu and laku were at recife during october <year> they were in belém finally arriving in manaus on december <num> <year>
tokugoro ito arrived some time later
on december <num> <year> the first demonstration in belém took place at the theatro politheama
the o tempo newspaper announced the event stating that conde koma would show the main jiu @-@ jitsu techniques excepting the prohibited ones
he would also demonstrate self @-@ defense techniques
after that the troupe would be accepting challenges from the crowd and there would be the first sensational match of jiu @-@ jitsu between shimitsu champion of argentina and laku peruvian military professor
on december <num> <year> according to o tempo jiu @-@ jitsu world champion maeda head of the japanese troupe and satake new york champion performed an enthusiastic and sensational jiu @-@ jitsu match
on the same day nagib assef an australian greco @-@ roman wrestling champion of turkish origin challenged maeda
on december <num> <year> maeda defeated in seconds the boxer barbadiano adolpho corbiniano who became one of his disciples
on january <num> <year> at theatro politheama maeda finally fought nagib assef who was thrown off the stage and pinned into submission by arm @-@ lock
on january <num> <year> maeda okura and shimitsu boarded the ss antony and left for liverpool
tokugoro ito went to los angeles
satake and laku stayed in manaus teaching according to o tempo jiu @-@ jitsu
after <num> years together maeda and satake had finally split up
of this last trip little is known
maeda went from england to portugal spain and france coming back to brazil in <year> alone
settling in belém do pará maeda married d
may iris
maeda was still popular in brazil and recognized as a great fighter although he only fought sporadically after his return
around <year> – <year> maeda accepted a challenge from the famous capoeirista pé de bola
maeda allowed pé de bola to use a knife in the fight
the capoeirista was <num> cm tall and weighed <num> kg
maeda won the match quickly
in <year> maeda founded his first judo academy in brazil
it was called clube remo and its building was a <num> m x <num> m shed
later it was moved to the fire brigade headquarters and then to the church of n
s
de aparecida
in <year> the academy was located in the sesi and was run by alfredo mendes coimbra of the third generation of conde koma 's descendants
on september <num> <year> maeda satake and okura were briefly in new york city
they were aboard the booth line steamship ss polycarp
all three men listed their occupations as professors of juitso
after leaving new york the three men went to the caribbean where they stayed from september to december <year>
at some point in this trip maeda was joined by his wife
in havana satake and maeda took part in some contests
their opponents included paul alvarez who wrestled as espanol icognito
alvarez defeated satake and yako okura — the latter being billed as a former instructor at the chilean naval academy — before being himself beaten by maeda
maeda also defeated a cuban boxer called jose ibarra and a french wrestler called fournier
the havana papers attributed maeda with a cuban student called conde chenard
this was part of a large tract in the amazon forest set aside for japanese settlement by the brazilian government
the crops grown by the japanese were not popular with the brazilians and the japanese investors eventually gave up on the project
maeda also continued teaching judo now mostly to the children of japanese immigrants
consequently in <year> the kodokan promoted him to <num> dan and on november <num> <year> to <num> dan
maeda never knew of this final promotion because he died in belém on november <num> <year>
the cause of death was kidney disease
in may <year> a memorial to maeda was erected in hirosaki city japan
the dedication ceremony was attended by risei kano and kaichiro samura
in <year> italian argentine circus queirolo brothers staged shows there and presented maeda
in <year> carlos gracie — <num> ‑ year @-@ old son of gastão gracie — watched a demonstration by maeda at the da paz theatre and decided to learn judo also known at the time as kano jiu @-@ jitsu
maeda accepted gracie and luiz frança as students <num> and the youth went on to become a great exponent of the art and ultimately with his younger brother hélio gracie founded gracie jiu @-@ jitsu modern brazilian jiu @-@ jitsu
in <year> gastão gracie and his family moved to rio de janeiro
carlos then <num> years old passed maeda 's teachings on to his brothers osvaldo gastão and jorge
hélio is considered by many as the founder of brazilian jiu @-@ jitsu though others such as carlson gracie have pointed to carlos as the founder
the book details maeda 's theory that physical combat could be broken down into distinct phases such as the striking phase the grappling phase the ground phase and so on
thus it was a smart fighter 's task to keep the fight located in the phase of combat that best suited his own strengths
the book further states that this theory was a fundamental influence on the gracie approach to combat
the approach included armed versus armed armed versus unarmed unarmed standing tachiwaza 立ち技 kneeling suwariwaza 座技 and ground work newaza 寝技 close quarters hakuheijugi 白兵主義 and other forms of combat
it was employed by other proponents of judo kano jiu @-@ jutsu who like maeda engaged in challenge match fighting overseas as judo spread internationally e

foxes are a common subject of japanese folklore in english kitsune refers to them in this context
stories depict them as intelligent beings and as possessing magical abilities that increase with their age and wisdom
according to yōkai folklore all foxes have the ability to shape shift into men or women
while some folktales speak of kitsune employing this ability to trick others — as foxes in folklore often do — other stories portray them as faithful guardians friends lovers and wives
foxes and human beings lived close together in ancient japan this companionship gave rise to legends about the creatures
kitsune have become closely associated with inari a shinto kami or spirit and serve as its messengers
this role has reinforced the fox 's supernatural significance
the more tails a kitsune has — they may have as many as nine — the older wiser and more powerful it is
because of their potential power and influence some people make offerings to them as to a deity
conversely foxes were often seen as witch animals especially during the superstitious edo period <year> – <year> and were goblins who could not be trusted similar to some badgers and cats
chinese folk tales tell of fox spirits called húli jīng chinese 狐狸精 that may have up to nine tails kyūbi no kitsune in japanese
many of the earliest surviving stories are recorded in the konjaku monogatarishū an <num> @-@ century collection of chinese indian and japanese narratives
the nine @-@ tailed foxes came to be adapted as a motif from chinese mythology to japanese mythology
smyers <year> notes that the idea of the fox as seductress and the connection of the fox myths to buddhism were introduced into japanese folklore through similar chinese stories but she maintains that some fox stories contain elements unique to japan
the oldest known usage of the word is in the <num> text shin 'yaku kegonkyō ongi shiki
other old sources include nihon ryōiki <num> – <num> and wamyō ruijushō c
<num>
these oldest sources are written in man 'yōgana which clearly identifies the historical spelling as ki1tune
following several diachronic phonological changes this becomes kitsune
many etymological suggestions have been made though there is no general agreement myōgoki <num> suggests that it is so called because it is always tsune yellow ki
early kamakura period mizukagami indicates that it means came ki perfective aspect particle tsu to bedroom ne due to a legend that a kitsune would change into one 's wife and bear children
arai hakuseki in tōga <year> suggests that ki means stench tsu is a possessive particle and ne is related to inu the word for dog
tanikawa kotosuga in wakun no shiori <year> – <year> suggests that ki means yellow tsu is a possessive particle and ne is related to neko the word for cat
ōtsuki fumihiko in daigenkai <year> – <year> proposes that the word comes from kitsu which is onomatopoeia for the bark of a fox and ne which may be an affix or an honorific word meaning a servant of an inari shrine
nozaki also suggests that the word kitsune was originally onomatopoetic
kitsu represented a fox 's yelp and came to be the general word for fox
-ne signifies an affectionate mood
kitsu is now archaic in modern japanese a fox 's cry is transcribed as kon kon or gon gon
one of the oldest surviving kitsune tales provides a widely known folk etymology of the word kitsune
unlike most tales of kitsune who become human and marry human males this one does not end tragically ono an inhabitant of mino says an ancient japanese legend of a
d
<num> spent the seasons longing for his ideal of female beauty
he met her one evening on a vast moor and married her
simultaneously with the birth of their son ono 's dog was delivered of a pup which as it grew up became more and more hostile to the lady of the moors
she begged her husband to kill it but he refused
at last one day the dog attacked her so furiously that she lost courage resumed vulpine shape leaped over a fence and fled
you may be a fox ono called after her but you are the mother of my son and i love you
come back when you please you will always be welcome
so every evening she stole back and slept in his arms
because the fox returns to her husband each night as a woman but leaves each morning as a fox she is called kitsune
in classical japanese kitsu @-@ ne means come and sleep and ki @-@ tsune means always comes
they are a type of yōkai or spiritual entity and the word kitsune is often translated as fox spirit
however this does not mean that kitsune are ghosts nor that they are fundamentally different from regular foxes
because the word spirit is used to reflect a state of knowledge or enlightenment all long @-@ lived foxes gain supernatural abilities
there are two common classifications of kitsune
the zenko 善狐 literally good foxes are benevolent celestial foxes associated with inari they are sometimes simply called inari foxes
on the other hand the yako 野狐 literally field foxes also called nogitsune tend to be mischievous or even malicious
local traditions add further types
for example a ninko is an invisible fox spirit that human beings can only perceive when it possesses them
physically kitsune are noted for having as many as nine tails
generally a greater number of tails indicates an older and more powerful fox in fact some folktales say that a fox will only grow additional tails after it has lived <num> years
one five seven and nine tails are the most common numbers in folk stories
when a kitsune gains its ninth tail its fur becomes white or gold
these kyūbi no kitsune 九尾の狐 nine @-@ tailed foxes gain the abilities to see and hear anything happening anywhere in the world
other tales credit them with infinite wisdom omniscience
as a common prerequisite for the transformation the fox must place reeds a broad leaf or a skull over its head
common forms assumed by kitsune include beautiful women young girls or elderly men
these shapes are not limited by the fox 's age or gender and a kitsune can duplicate the appearance of a specific person
foxes are particularly renowned for impersonating beautiful women
common belief in medieval japan was that any woman encountered alone especially at dusk or night could be a fox
kitsune @-@ gao or fox @-@ faced refers to human females who have a narrow face with close @-@ set eyes thin eyebrows and high cheekbones
traditionally this facial structure is considered attractive and some tales ascribe it to foxes in human form
variants on the theme have the kitsune retain other foxlike traits such as a coating of fine hair a fox @-@ shaped shadow or a reflection that shows its true form
in some stories kitsune have difficulty hiding their tails when they take human form looking for the tail perhaps when the fox gets drunk or careless is a common method of discerning the creature 's true nature
a particularly devout individual may in some cases even be able to see through a fox 's disguise merely by perceiving them
kitsune may also be exposed while in human form by their fear and hatred of dogs and some become so rattled by their presence that they revert to the form of a fox and flee
one folk story illustrating these imperfections in the kitsune 's human shape concerns koan a historical person credited with wisdom and magical powers of divination
according to the story he was staying at the home of one of his devotees when he scalded his foot entering a bath because the water had been drawn too hot
then in his pain he ran out of the bathroom naked
when the people of the household saw him they were astonished to see that koan had fur covering much of his body along with a fox 's tail
then koan transformed in front of them becoming an elderly fox and running away
other supernatural abilities commonly attributed to the kitsune include possession mouths or tails that generate fire or lightning known as kitsunebi willful manifestation in the dreams of others flight invisibility and the creation of illusions so elaborate as to be almost indistinguishable from reality
some tales speak of kitsune with even greater powers able to bend time and space drive people mad or take fantastic shapes such as a tree of incredible height or a second moon in the sky
other kitsune have characteristics reminiscent of vampires or succubi and feed on the life or spirit of human beings generally through sexual contact
the victim is usually a young woman whom the fox enters beneath her fingernails or through her breasts
in some cases the victims facial expressions are said to change in such a way that they resemble those of a fox
japanese tradition holds that fox possession can cause illiterate victims to temporarily gain the ability to read
though foxes in folklore can possess a person of their own will kitsunetsuki is often attributed to the malign intents of hereditary fox employers or tsukimono @-@ suji
folklorist lafcadio hearn describes the condition strange is the madness of those into whom demon foxes enter
sometimes they run naked shouting through the streets
sometimes they lie down and froth at the mouth and yelp as a fox yelps
and on some part of the body of the possessed a moving lump appears under the skin which seems to have a life of its own
prick it with a needle and it glides instantly to another place
by no grasp can it be so tightly compressed by a strong hand that it will not slip from under the fingers
possessed folk are also said to speak and write languages of which they were totally ignorant prior to possession
they eat only what foxes are believed to like — tofu aburagé azukimeshi etc
— and they eat a great deal alleging that not they but the possessing foxes are hungry
he goes on to note that once freed from the possession the victim will never again be able to eat tofu azukimeshi or other foods favored by foxes exorcism often performed at an inari shrine may induce a fox to leave its host
in the past when such gentle measures failed or a priest was not available victims of kitsunetsuki were beaten or badly burned in hopes of forcing the fox to leave
entire families were ostracized by their communities after a member of the family was thought to be possessed
in japan kitsunetsuki was noted as a disease as early as the heian period and remained a common diagnosis for mental illness until the early <num> century
possession was the explanation for the abnormal behavior displayed by the afflicted individuals
in the late <num> century dr
shunichi shimamura noted that physical diseases that caused fever were often considered kitsunetsuki
the belief has lost favor but stories of fox possession still occur such as allegations that members of the aum shinrikyo cult had been possessed
in medicine kitsunetsuki is a culture @-@ bound syndrome unique to japanese culture
those who suffer from the condition believe they are possessed by a fox
symptoms include cravings for rice or sweet adzuki beans listlessness restlessness and aversion to eye contact
kitsunetsuki is similar to but distinct from clinical lycanthropy
tales describe these as glowing with kitsunebi
some stories identify them as magical jewels or pearls
when not in human form or possessing a human a kitsune keeps the ball in its mouth or carries it on its tail
jewels are a common symbol of inari and representations of sacred inari foxes without them are rare
one belief is that when a kitsune changes shape its hoshi no tama holds a portion of its magical power
another tradition is that the pearl represents the kitsune 's soul the kitsune will die if separated from it for long
those who obtain the ball may be able to extract a promise from the kitsune to help them in exchange for its return
for example a <num> @-@ century tale describes a man using a fox 's hoshi no tama to secure a favor confound you snapped the fox
give me back my ball the man ignored its pleas till finally it said tearfully all right you 've got the ball but you don 't know how to keep it
it won 't be any good to you
for me it 's a terrible loss
i tell you if you don 't give it back i 'll be your enemy forever
if you do give it back though i 'll stick to you like a protector god
the fox later saves his life by leading him past a band of armed robbers
noh kyogen bunraku and kabuki plays derived from folk tales feature them as do contemporary works such as anime manga and video games
japanese metal idol band babymetal refer to the kitsune myth in their lyrics and include the use of fox masks hand signs and animation interludes during live shows
western authors of fiction have also made use of the kitsune legends
this association has reinforced the fox 's supernatural significance
originally kitsune were inari 's messengers but the line between the two is now blurred so that inari ōkami may be depicted as a fox
likewise entire shrines are dedicated to kitsune where devotees can leave offerings
fox spirits are said to be particularly fond of a fried sliced tofu called aburage which is accordingly found in the noodle @-@ based dishes kitsune udon and kitsune soba
similarly inari @-@ zushi is a type of sushi named for inari ōkami that consists of rice @-@ filled pouches of fried tofu
there is speculation among folklorists as to whether another shinto fox deity existed in the past
foxes have long been worshipped as kami
inari 's kitsune are white a color of good omen
they possess the power to ward off evil and they sometimes serve as guardian spirits
in addition to protecting inari shrines they are petitioned to intervene on behalf of the locals and particularly to aid against troublesome nogitsune those spirit foxes who do not serve inari
black foxes and nine @-@ tailed foxes are likewise considered good omens
according to beliefs derived from fusui feng shui the fox 's power over evil is such that a mere statue of a fox can dispel the evil kimon or energy that flows from the northeast
many inari shrines such as the famous fushimi inari shrine in kyoto feature such statues sometimes large numbers of them
kitsune are connected to the buddhist religion through the dakiniten goddesses conflated with inari 's female aspect
dakiniten is depicted as a female boddhisattva wielding a sword and riding a flying white fox
stories tell of kitsune playing tricks on overly proud samurai greedy merchants and boastful commoners while the crueler ones abuse poor tradesmen and farmers or devout buddhist monks
their victims are usually men women are possessed instead
for example kitsune are thought to employ their kitsunebi to lead travelers astray in the manner of a will o the wisp
another tactic is for the kitsune to confuse its target with illusions or visions
other common goals of trickster kitsune include seduction theft of food humiliation of the prideful or vengeance for a perceived slight
a traditional game called kitsune @-@ ken fox @-@ fist references the kitsune 's powers over human beings
the game is similar to rock paper scissors but the three hand positions signify a fox a hunter and a village headman
the headman beats the hunter whom he outranks the hunter beats the fox whom he shoots the fox beats the headman whom he bewitches
this ambiguous portrayal coupled with their reputation for vengefulness leads people to try to discover a troublesome fox 's motives
in one case the <num> @-@ century leader toyotomi hideyoshi wrote a letter to the kami inari to inari daimyojin my lord i have the honor to inform you that one of the foxes under your jurisdiction has bewitched one of my servants causing her and others a great deal of trouble
i have to request that you make minute inquiries into the matter and endeavor to find out the reason of your subject misbehaving in this way and let me know the result
if it turns out that the fox has no adequate reason to give for his behavior you are to arrest and punish him at once
if you hesitate to take action in this matter i shall issue orders for the destruction of every fox in the land
any other particulars that you may wish to be informed of in reference to what has occurred you can learn from the high priest of yoshida
kitsune keep their promises and strive to repay any favor
occasionally a kitsune attaches itself to a person or household where they can cause all sorts of mischief
in one story from the <num> century only the homeowner 's threat to exterminate the foxes convinces them to behave
the kitsune patriarch appears in the man 's dreams my father lived here before me sir and by now i have many children and grandchildren
they get into a lot of mischief i 'm afraid and i 'm always after them to stop but they never listen
and now sir you 're understandably fed up with us
i gather that you 're going to kill us all
but i just want you to know sir how sorry i am that this is our last night of life
won 't you pardon us one more time if we ever make trouble again then of course you must act as you think best
but the young ones sir — i 'm sure they 'll understand when i explain to them why you 're so upset
we 'll do everything we can to protect you from now on if only you 'll forgive us and we 'll be sure to let you know when anything good is going to happen other kitsune use their magic for the benefit of their companion or hosts as long as the human beings treat them with respect
as yōkai however kitsune do not share human morality and a kitsune who has adopted a house in this manner may for example bring its host money or items that it has stolen from the neighbors
accordingly common households thought to harbor kitsune are treated with suspicion
oddly samurai families were often reputed to share similar arrangements with kitsune but these foxes were considered zenko and the use of their magic a sign of prestige
abandoned homes were common haunts for kitsune
one <num> @-@ century story tells of a minister moving into an old mansion only to discover a family of foxes living there
they first try to scare him away then claim that the house has been ours for many years and
we wish to register a vigorous protest
the man refuses and the foxes resign themselves to moving to an abandoned lot nearby
tales distinguish kitsune gifts from kitsune payments
if a kitsune offers a payment or reward that includes money or material wealth part or all of the sum will consist of old paper leaves twigs stones or similar valueless items under a magical illusion
true kitsune gifts are usually intangibles such as protection knowledge or long life
the kitsune may be a seductress but these stories are more often romantic in nature
typically the young man unknowingly marries the fox who proves a devoted wife
the man eventually discovers the fox 's true nature and the fox @-@ wife is forced to leave him
in some cases the husband wakes as if from a dream filthy disoriented and far from home
he must then return to confront his abandoned family in shame
many stories tell of fox @-@ wives bearing children
when such progeny are human they possess special physical or supernatural qualities that often pass to their own children
the astrologer @-@ magician abe no seimei was reputed to have inherited such extraordinary powers
other stories tell of kitsune marrying one another
rain falling from a clear sky — a sunshower — is called kitsune no yomeiri or the kitsune 's wedding in reference to a folktale describing a wedding ceremony between the creatures being held during such conditions
the event is considered a good omen but the kitsune will seek revenge on any uninvited guests as is depicted in akira kurosawa 's film dreams
stephen turnbull in nagashino <year> relates the tale of the takeda clan 's involvement with a fox @-@ woman
the warlord takeda shingen in <year> defeated in battle a lesser local warlord named suwa yorishige and drove him to suicide after a humiliating and spurious peace conference after which shingen forced marriage on suwa yorishige 's beautiful <num> @-@ year @-@ old daughter lady koi — shingen 's own niece
shingen turnbull writes was so obsessed with the girl that his superstitious followers became alarmed and believed her to be an incarnation of the white fox @-@ spirit of the suwa shrine who had bewitched him in order to gain revenge

<num> @-@ mile <num>

the route begins in the village of sleepy hollow at u

it ends at ny <num> in mount pleasant near the junction of ny <num> with saw mill river road ny 9a and ny <num> and the taconic state parkway
from <year> to the early <num> ny <num> was part of ny <num>
after the webber avenue intersection ny <num> turns to the northeast where it passes the athletic fields of sleepy hollow high school
ny <num> intersects with sleepy hollow road which leads into a residential development and parallels ny <num> northeastward for a short distance
near the southern edge of rockefeller state park preserve ny <num> turns east and enters kykuit the estate of the rockefeller family
at the hamlet of pocantico hills the highway intersects with lake road and turns to the northeast passing through more residential areas as it leaves the estate
ny <num> passes the pocantico hills central school on its way continuing northeast towards phelps way ny <num>
the road continues through a vacant area and heads northward into mount pleasant where ny <num> terminates at an intersection with ny <num>
bedford road continues east of this point as part of ny <num>
in <year> – <num> john d
rockefeller offered to straighten a short section of ny <num> that passed through kykuit the rockefeller family estate citing safety concerns
the state expressed similar sentiments in <year> deeming the stretch unsafe for commercial traffic
by the <num> the annual average daily traffic count along ny <num> had grown to <num> @,@ <num> vehicles per day far more than the <num> @,@ <num> that the road had originally been built to serve
this led the new york state legislature to approve plans for a new alignment for ny <num> in <year>
the new road would be located north of the existing road relieving traffic congestion on the albany post road us <num> and ny <num> and providing access to ny 9a us <num> the taconic state parkway and the proposed hudson river expressway in the north tarrytown area
several different routes were considered for the alignment
the path ultimately selected by the state was a four @-@ lane limited @-@ access highway <num> mile <num>
<num> km north of the current alignment that would cost <num>
<num> million <year> usd
another proposed route would have cost <num> million <year> usd containing additional grades and curves while coming closer to the rockefeller estate
construction on the new ny <num> was expected to begin before the end of <year>
the reaction from area residents was mixed with some believing that the only beneficiaries of a realigned ny <num> was the rockefeller family
rumors that the rockefeller family had wanted ny <num> moved had existed as early as the <num> and us representative richard ottinger believed that nelson rockefeller then the governor of new york was using his political power to move ny <num> away from kykuit at the cost of the state
an aide to the rockefellers denied this charge
the sleepy hollow valley committee comprising <num> members whose homes were in the right @-@ of @-@ way of the new alignment protested that the route would destroy the countryside
they were opposed by the potantico hills residents committee as most residents in potantico hills supported the new alignment
the former committee filed a lawsuit in the new york state supreme court to block the new roadway and they were joined in their efforts by conservationist groups and the village of north tarrytown
on june <num> <year> the case was heard by the court
engineers with the new york state department of highways were accused of showing unprecedented pell @-@ mell haste in working on a project with the rockefellers before any injunctions could stop it
state attorney general joseph romano countered that the state was not conspiring to provide anyone special benefits saying that ny <num> was dangerous for years and opponents to the project were thinking up little gimmicks picayune arguments and ethereal ideas to mislead the court
a request by the state to dismiss the suit was denied in august <year> and the case was eventually heard by the state court of appeals the highest court in the state
in the meantime the state built the easternmost mile <num>
<num> km of the new alignment which was not affected by the lawsuit
on july <num> <year> the court ruled <num> – <num> in favor of the sleepy hollow valley committee
as a result the western half of the new road was moved an additional mile to the north bypassing north tarrytown completely
the new alignment of ny <num> was completed in the early <num> and its former alignment along bedford road was redesignated as ny <num>
the twenty @-@ first tropical cyclone nineteenth named storm and eleventh hurricane of the season tanya developed from a tropical wave while well north of the lesser antilles on october <num>
the system headed northeastward and strengthened into tropical storm tanya on october <num>
tanya meandered around the central atlantic and further intensified into a hurricane on october <num>
thereafter tanya tracked northeastward before curving to the east @-@ northeast
after switching to an eastward direction tanya weakened to a tropical storm on november <num>
later that day tanya passed through the azores as it was transitioning into an extratropical cyclone
throughout the azores the extratropical remnants of tanya produced high winds
as a result extensive property damage occurred which included destroyed or damaged houses and sunken boats there were also reports of significant damage to agriculture
however an exact damage toll figure in unknown
in addition there was one fatality and several injuries
the wave closely followed the path of tropical storm sebastien and was unable to develop in the tropical atlantic as it moved westward
the system did not begin to become organized until october <num> while south @-@ southeast of bermuda
however the dvorak technique was still unable to classify the system until october <num> as the low @-@ cloud swirl became better organized while moving northward in the central atlantic
that evening a closed circulation had formed and it was classified as tropical depression twenty @-@ one by the national hurricane center
on the morning of october <num> it strengthened into a tropical storm becoming the <num> as well as the final named storm of the season
operationally it was not declared a tropical cyclone until that point when it was immediately declared tropical storm tanya
immediately after becoming a tropical storm the movement of tanya became hindered by a nearby upper @-@ level low and it quickly turned eastward before virtually stalling early on october <num>
the upper @-@ level low also influenced tanya in giving it some subtropical characteristics including a comma @-@ shaped cloud band and maximum winds far from the center of the storm at the time
despite that the storm gradually strengthened as it remained over warm waters of about <num> ° f <num> ° c
that afternoon it gained full tropical characteristics as an eye featured was beginning to form in the central dense overcast
the eye became clearly defined although it was small in size
early on october <num> tropical storm tanya was upgraded to a hurricane the eleventh of the <year> season as it turned northward in response to the nearby low
later on october <num> while slowly tracking north tanya leveled off as a low @-@ end category <num> hurricane
by the next morning a cold front to the west forced tanya to accelerate in a more easterly track
it remained fairly well organized with a distinct eye as it became wedged in a narrow zone of warm air between the cold front to the west and the upper @-@ level low to the northeast
despite slightly cooler water tanya strengthened a bit more that afternoon reaching its peak intensity of <num> mph <num> km h with a barometric pressure of <num> mbar <num>
<num> inhg as the forward speed increased
that intensity was maintained until late on october <num> when tanya began to weaken as it traveled over cooler waters and the eye became obscured
early on november <num> tanya began to lose tropical characteristics while still a hurricane
hurricane tanya was also heading rapidly northeast towards the azores at the time
tanya was downgraded from a hurricane to a tropical storm on november <num>
despite weakening the wind field of tanya became larger
that evening tanya was declared fully extratropical as it passed the azores
the remnant cyclone turned north before being absorbed by another extratropical cyclone early on november <num>
the azores were hit very hard by the storm which had just been declared extratropical when it hit the region
damage was particularly severe on the islands of faial pico terceira and são jorge
extensive property damage was reported including many sunk boats many houses were damaged and some destroyed and significant agricultural damage
many trees and power lines were also knocked down cutting electricity and hampering communications in the area
the highest wind gusts reported in the azores were around <num> mph <num> km h
after the storm a resolution was submitted to the european parliament by the government of portugal and a disaster area was declared in the islands
one spanish fisherman drowned and several people were injured
there were many reports of tropical storm @-@ force winds from ships in the north atlantic
one ship with the call sign gbsa encountered tanya 's winds twice and reported the strongest winds from any ship <num> mph <num> km h
hurricane tanya was the first storm to be designated with a name starting with t since naming of atlantic tropical cyclones began in <year>

upon its release the video went viral and received over one million views in its first day of release
it has finely blotched yellow @-@ green plumage a distinct facial disc of sensory vibrissa @-@ like feathers a large grey beak short legs large feet and wings and a tail of relatively short length
a combination of traits make it unique among its kind it is the world 's only flightless parrot the heaviest parrot nocturnal herbivorous visibly sexually dimorphic in body size has a low basal metabolic rate and no male parental care and is the only parrot to have a polygynous lek breeding system
it is also possibly one of the world 's longest @-@ living birds
its anatomy typifies the tendency of bird evolution on oceanic islands with few predators and abundant food a generally robust physique with accretion of thermodynamic efficiency at the expense of flight abilities reduced wing muscles and a diminished keel on the sternum
like many other new zealand bird species the kakapo was historically important to the māori the indigenous people of new zealand appearing in many of their traditional legends and folklore
it was hunted and used as a resource by māori both for its meat as a food source and for its feathers which were used to make highly valued pieces of clothing
it was also sometimes kept as a pet
the kakapo is critically endangered as of march <year> with an additional six from the first hatchings since <year> the total known population was only <num> living individuals as reported by the kakapo recovery programme most of which have been given names
because of polynesian and european colonisation and the introduction of predators such as cats rats ferrets and stoats the kakapo was almost wiped out
conservation efforts began in the <num> but they were not very successful until the implementation of the kakapo recovery plan in the <num>
as of april <year> surviving kakapo are kept on three predator @-@ free islands codfish whenua hou anchor and little barrier islands where they are closely monitored
two large fiordland islands resolution and secretary have been the subject of large @-@ scale ecological restoration activities to prepare self @-@ sustaining ecosystems with suitable habitat for the kakapo
the new zealand government is willingly providing the use of these islands to kakapo conservation
a successful breeding season in <year> saw <num> chicks fledge taking the total population to <num>
the name kakapo is the english transliteration of kākāpō which is derived from the māori terms kākā parrot pō night
its generic name is derived from the ancient greek strix genitive strigos owl and ops face while its specific epithet comes from habros soft and ptilon feather
it has so many unusual features that it was initially placed in its own tribe strigopini
recent phylogenetic studies have confirmed the unique position of this genus as well as the closeness to the kākā and the kea both belonging to the new zealand parrot genus nestor
together they are now considered a separate family within the parrots strigopidae
within the strigopidae the kakapo is placed in its own tribe strigopini
the common ancestor of the kakapo and the genus nestor became isolated from the remaining parrot species when new zealand broke off from gondwana around <num> million years ago
around <num> million years ago the kakapo diverged from the genus nestor
earlier ornithologists felt that the kakapo might be related to the ground parrots and night parrot of australia due to their similar colouration but this is contradicted by recent studies rather the cryptic colour seems to be adaptation to terrestrial habits that evolved twice convergently
<num> to <num> kg <num> to <num> lb at maturity
males are larger than females
twenty @-@ eight males were found to average <num> kg <num>
<num> lb in one study and <num> males were found to average <num>

<num> lb in another
in the same studies <num> females were found to average <num>

<num> kg <num>
<num> lb
however one source states that females will not breed until they attain a threshold weight of <num>
<num> kg <num>
<num> lb
they are the heaviest living species of parrot while the largest males attain much heavier weights than any other extant parrot kakapos average about <num> g <num> oz more than a hyacinth macaw
the kakapo cannot fly having short wings for its size and lacking the pronounced keel bone sternum that anchors the flight muscles of other birds
it uses its wings for balance support and to break its fall when leaping from trees
unlike other land birds the kakapo can accumulate large amounts of body fat to store energy making it the heaviest parrot
the upper parts of the kakapo have yellowish moss @-@ green feathers barred or mottled with black or dark brownish grey blending well with native vegetation
individuals may have strongly varying degrees of mottling and colour tone and intensity — museum specimens show that some birds had completely yellow colouring
the breast and flank are yellowish @-@ green streaked with yellow
the belly undertail neck and face are predominantly yellowish streaked with pale green and weakly mottled with brownish @-@ grey
because the feathers do not need the strength and stiffness required for flight they are exceptionally soft giving rise to the specific epithet habroptilus
the kakapo has a conspicuous facial disc of fine feathers resembling the face of an owl thus early european settlers called it the owl parrot
the beak is surrounded by delicate vibrissae or whiskers which the bird uses to sense the ground for navigation as it walks with its head lowered
the mandible is mostly ivory @-@ coloured with part of the upper mandible being bluish @-@ grey
the eyes are dark brown
kakapo feet are large scaly and as in all parrots zygodactyl two toes face forward and two backward
the pronounced claws are particularly useful for climbing
the ends of the tail feathers often become worn from being continually dragged on the ground
the female is easily distinguished from the male she has a more narrow and less domed head her beak is narrower and proportionally longer her cere and nostrils smaller her legs and feet more slender and pinkish grey and her tail proportionally longer
while her plumage colour is not very different from that of the male the toning is more subtle with less yellow and mottling
she tends to resist more and be more aggressive than the male when handled
a nesting female also has a brood patch on the bare skin of the belly
like many parrots the kakapo has a variety of calls
as well as the booms see below for a recording and chings of their mating calls it will often skraark to announce its location to other birds
the kakapo has a well @-@ developed sense of smell which complements its nocturnal lifestyle
it can discriminate among odours while foraging a behaviour reported for only one other parrot species
one of the most striking characteristics of the kakapo is its pleasant and powerful odour which has been described as musty
given the kakapo 's well @-@ developed sense of smell this scent may be a social chemosignal
the smell often alerts predators to the largely defenceless kakapo
firstly it has the smallest relative wing size of any parrot
its wing feathers are shorter more rounded and less asymmetrical and have fewer distal barbules to lock the feathers together
the sternum is small and has a low vestigial keel and a shortened spina externa
as in other flightless birds and some other flighted parrots the furcula is not fused but consists of a pair of clavicles lying in contact with each coracoid
as in other flightless birds the angle between the coracoid and sternum is enlarged
the kakapo has a larger pelvis than other parrots
the proximal bones of the leg and arm are disproportionately long and the distal elements are disproportionately short
the pectoral musculature of the kakapo is also modified by flightlessness
the pectoralis and supracoracoideus muscles are greatly reduced
the propatagialis tendo longus has no distinct muscle belly
the sternocoracoideus is tendinous
there is an extensive cucularis capitis clavicularis muscle that is associated with the large crop
before the arrival of humans the kakapo was distributed throughout the three main islands of new zealand
it lived in a variety of habitats including tussocklands scrublands and coastal areas
it also inhabited forests including those dominated by podocarps rimu matai kahikatea totara beeches tawa and rata
in fiordland areas of avalanche and slip debris with regenerating and heavily fruiting vegetation – such as five finger wineberry bush lawyer tutu hebes and coprosmas – became known as kakapo gardens
the kakapo is primarily nocturnal it roosts under cover in trees or on the ground during the day and moves around its territories at night
though the kakapo cannot fly it is an excellent climber ascending to the crowns of the tallest trees
it can also parachute – descending by leaping and spreading its wings
in this way it may travel a few metres yards at an angle of less than <num> degrees
having lost the ability to fly it has developed strong legs
movement is often by way of a rapid jog @-@ like gait by which it can move many kilometres
a female has been observed making two return trips each night during nesting from her nest to a food source up to <num> km <num>
<num> mi away and the male may walk from its home range to a mating arena up to <num> km <num> mi away during the mating season october – january
young birds indulge in play fighting and one bird will often lock the neck of another under its chin
the kakapo is curious by nature and has been known to interact with humans
conservation staff and volunteers have engaged extensively with some kakapo which have distinct personalities
the kakapo was a very successful species in pre @-@ human new zealand and one of the reasons for this was their set of adaptations to effectively avoid predation from native birds of prey which were their only predators in the past
however these same behaviours have been of no use to them when faced with the mammalian predators which were introduced to new zealand after human settlement because these hunt in different ways
as hunters birds behave very differently from mammals relying on their powerful vision to find prey and thus they usually with the exception of owls hunt by day
apart from the two surviving new zealand raptors the new zealand falcon and swamp harrier there were two other birds of prey in pre @-@ human new zealand haast 's eagle and eyles harrier
all four species soared overhead searching for prey in daylight and to avoid these avian predators the kakapo 's ancestors adopted camouflaged plumage and became nocturnal
in addition when the kakapo feels threatened it freezes so that it is more effectively camouflaged in the forest vegetation which their plumage resembles
it was not entirely safe at night when the laughing owl was active and it is apparent from their nest deposits on canterbury limestone cliffs that the kakapo was among their prey
mammalian predators in contrast to birds rely on their sense of smell and hearing to find prey and often hunt by night
the kakapo 's adaptations to avoid avian predation have thus been useless against its new enemies – this is one of the reasons for its massive decline since the introduction of dogs cats and mustelids – see conservation human impact
a typical way for humans to hunt down the kakapo is by releasing trained dogs
for this reason the kakapo has a very small gizzard compared to other birds of their size
it is generally herbivorous eating native plants seeds fruits pollen and even the sapwood of trees
a study in <year> identified <num> plant species as kakapo food
it is particularly fond of the fruit of the rimu tree and will feed on it exclusively during seasons when it is abundant
the kakapo has a distinctive habit of grabbing a leaf or frond with a foot and stripping the nutritious parts of the plant out with its beak leaving a ball of indigestible fibre
these little clumps of plant fibres are a distinctive sign of the presence of the bird
the kakapo is believed to employ bacteria in the fore @-@ gut to ferment and help digest plant matter
kakapo diet changes according to the season
the plants eaten most frequently during the year include some species of lycopodium ramulosum lycopodium fastigium schizaea fistulosa blechnum minus blechnum procerum cyathodes juniperina dracophyllum longifolium olearia colensoi and thelymitra venosa
individual plants of the same species are often treated differently
kakapo leave conspicuous evidence of their feeding activities over feeding areas that range between <num> by <num> metres <num> ft × <num> ft and <num> by <num> metres <num> ft × <num> ft per individual
kakapo feeding grounds almost always host manuka and yellow silver pine scrubs
males loosely gather in an arena and compete with each other to attract females
females listen to the males as they display or lek
they choose a mate based on the quality of his display they are not pursued by the males in any overt way
no pair bond is formed males and females meet only to mate
during the courting season males leave their home ranges for hilltops and ridges where they establish their own mating courts
these leks can be up to <num> kilometres <num> mi from a kakapo 's usual territory and are an average of <num> metres <num> ft apart within the lek arena
males remain in the region of their court throughout the courting season
at the start of the breeding season males will fight to try to secure the best courts
they confront each other with raised feathers spread wings open beaks raised claws and loud screeching and growling
fighting may leave birds with injuries or even kill them
each court consists of one or more saucer @-@ shaped depressions or bowls dug in the ground by the male up to <num> centimetres <num> in deep and long enough to fit the half @-@ metre length of the bird
the kakapo is one of only a handful of birds in the world which actually constructs its leks
bowls are often created next to rock faces banks or tree trunks to help reflect sound the bowls themselves function as amplifiers to enhance the projection of the males booming mating calls
each male 's bowls are connected by a network of trails or tracks which may extend <num> metres <num> ft along a ridge or <num> metres <num> ft in diameter around a hilltop
males meticulously clear their bowls and tracks of debris
one way researchers check whether bowls are visited at night is to place a few twigs in the bowl if the male visits overnight he will pick them up in his beak and toss them away
to attract females males make loud low @-@ frequency below <num> hz booming calls from their bowls by inflating a thoracic sac
they start with low grunts which increase in volume as the sac inflates
after a sequence of about <num> loud booms the male kakapo emits a high @-@ frequency metallic ching sound
he stands for a short while before again lowering his head inflating his chest and starting another sequence of booms
the booms can be heard at least <num> kilometre <num>
<num> mi away on a still night wind can carry the sound at least <num> kilometres <num>
<num> mi
males boom for an average of eight hours a night each male may produce thousands of booms in this time
this may continue every night for three or four months during which time the male may lose half his body weight
each male moves around the bowls in his court so that the booms are sent out in different directions
these booms are also notorious for attracting predators because of the long range at which they can be heard
females are attracted by the booms of the competing males they too may need to walk several kilometres from their territories to the arena
once a female enters the court of one of the males the male performs a display in which he rocks from side to side and makes clicking noises with his beak
he turns his back to the female spreads his wings in display and walks backwards towards her
he will then attempt copulation for <num> to <num> minutes
once the birds have mated the female returns to her home territory to lay eggs and raise the chicks
the male continues booming in the hope of attracting another female
the female kakapo lays <num> or <num> eggs rarely <num> per breeding cycle with long intervals between laying of first and second eggs
she nests on the ground under the cover of plants or in cavities such as hollow tree trunks
the female incubates the eggs faithfully but is forced to leave them every night in search of food
predators are known to eat the eggs and the embryos inside can also die of cold in the mother 's absence
kakapo eggs usually hatch within <num> days bearing fluffy grey chicks that are quite helpless
after the eggs hatch the female feeds the chicks for three months and the chicks remain with the female for some months after fledging
the young chicks are just as vulnerable to predators as the eggs and young have been killed by many of the same predators that attack adults
chicks leave the nest at approximately <num> to <num> weeks of age
as they gain greater independence their mothers may feed the chicks sporadically for up to <num> months
because the kakapo is long @-@ lived with an average life expectancy of <num> years and the maximum at about <num> years it tends to have an adolescence before it starts breeding
males do not start to boom until about <num> years of age
it was thought that females reached sexual maturity at <num> years of age but this idea was debunked in the <year> breeding season when two <num> @-@ year @-@ old females named apirama and rakiura laid eggs
generally females do not seek out males until they are between <num> and <num> years old
the kakapo does not breed every year and has one of the lowest rates of reproduction among birds
breeding occurs only in years when trees mast fruit heavily providing a plentiful food supply
rimu mast occurs only every three to five years so in rimu @-@ dominant forests such as those on codfish island kakapo breeding occurs as infrequently
another aspect of the kakapo 's breeding system is that a female can alter the sex ratio of her offspring depending on her condition
a female who eats protein @-@ rich foods produces more male offspring males have <num> – <num> more body weight than females
females produce offspring biased towards the dispersive sex when competition for resources such as food is high and towards the non @-@ dispersive sex when food is plentiful
a female kakapo will likely be able to produce eggs even when there are few resources while a male kakapo will be more capable of perpetuating the species when there are plenty by mating with several females
this supports the trivers – willard hypothesis
the relationship between clutch sex ratio and maternal diet has conservation implications because a captive population maintained on a high quality diet will produce fewer females and therefore fewer individuals valuable to the recovery of the species
however the kakapo population in new zealand has declined massively since human settlement of the country
since <year> conservation efforts have been made to prevent extinction
the most successful scheme has been the kakapo recovery programme this was implemented in <year> and continues
māori folklore suggests that the kakapo was found throughout the country when the polynesians first arrived in aotearoa <num> years ago
subfossil and midden deposits show that the bird was present throughout the north island south island and stewart island rakiura before and during early māori times
māori hunted the kakapo for food and for their skins and feathers which were made into cloaks
they used the dried heads as ear ornaments
due to its flightlessness strong scent and habit of freezing when threatened the kakapo was easy prey for the māori and their dogs
its eggs and chicks were also preyed upon by the polynesian rat or kiore which the māori brought to new zealand
furthermore the deliberate clearing of vegetation by māori reduced the habitable range for kakapo
although the kakapo was extinct in many parts of the islands by the time europeans arrived including the tararua and aorangi ranges it was still present in the central part of the north island and forested parts of the south island
beginning in the <num> european settlers cleared vast tracts of land for farming and grazing further reducing kakapo habitat
they brought more dogs and other mammalian predators including domestic cats black rats and stoats
europeans knew little of the kakapo until george gray of the british museum described it from a skin in <year>
as the māori had done early european explorers and their dogs ate kakapo
in the late <num> century the kakapo became well known as a scientific curiosity and thousands were captured or killed for zoos museums and collectors
most captured specimens died within months
from at least the <num> collectors knew the kakapo population was declining their prime concern was to collect as many as possible before the bird became extinct
in the <num> large numbers of mustelids stoats ferrets and weasels were released in new zealand to reduce rabbit numbers but they also preyed heavily on many native species including the kakapo
other browsing animals such as introduced deer competed with the kakapo for food and caused the extinction of some of its preferred plant species
the kakapo was reportedly still present near the head of the whanganui river as late as <year> with one of the last records of a kakapo in the north island being a single bird caught in the kaimanawa ranges by te kepa puawheawhe in <year>
in <year> the government appointed richard henry as caretaker
a keen naturalist henry was aware that native birds were declining and began catching and moving kakapo and kiwi from the mainland to the predator @-@ free resolution island
in six years he moved more than <num> kakapo to resolution island
by <year> however stoats had swum to resolution island and colonised it they wiped out the nascent kakapo population within <num> years
in <year> three kakapo were moved from resolution island to the nature reserve of little barrier island north @-@ east of auckland but feral cats were present and the kakapo were never seen again
in <year> three kakapo were moved to another reserve kapiti island north @-@ west of wellington
one of them survived until at least <year> despite the presence of feral cats for part of the intervening period
by the <num> the kakapo was extinct in the north island and its range and numbers in the south island were declining
one of its last refuges was rugged fiordland
there during the <num> it was often seen or heard and occasionally eaten by hunters or roadworkers
by the <num> reports of kakapo were becoming scarce
seven fiordland expeditions between <year> and <year> found only a few recent signs
finally in <year> a kakapo was caught and released in the milford sound catchment area in fiordland
six more kakapo were captured in <year> one was released and the other five were transferred to the aviaries of the mount bruce bird reserve near masterton in the north island
within months four of the birds had died and the fifth died after about four years
in the next <num> years regular expeditions found few signs of the kakapo indicating that numbers were continuing to decline
only one bird was captured in <year> it died the following year
by the early <num> it was uncertain whether the kakapo was still an extant species
at the end of <year> scientists located several more male kakapo and made the first scientific observations of kakapo booming
these observations led don merton to speculate for the first time that the kakapo had a lek breeding system
from <year> to <year> <num> kakapo were discovered but all appeared to be males
this raised the possibility that the species would become extinct because there might be no surviving females
one male bird was captured in the milford area in <year> christened richard henry and transferred to maud island
all the birds the wildlife service discovered from <year> to <year> were in u @-@ shaped glaciated valleys flanked by almost @-@ vertical cliffs and surrounded by high mountains
such extreme terrain had slowed colonisation by browsing mammals leaving islands of virtually unmodified native vegetation
however even here stoats were present and by <year> the kakapo was gone from the valley floors and only a few males survived high on the most inaccessible parts of the cliffs
before <year> no expedition had been to stewart island rakiura to search for the bird
in <year> sightings of kakapo were reported on stewart island
an expedition to the island found a track and bowl system on its first day soon after it located several dozen kakapo
the finding in an <num> @,@ <num> @-@ hectare area of fire @-@ modified scrubland and forest raised hope that the population would include females
the total population was estimated at <num> to <num> birds
mustelids have never colonised stewart island rakiura but feral cats were present
during a survey it was apparent that cats killed kakapo at a rate of <num> per year
at this rate the birds could not survive on the island and therefore an intensive cat control was introduced in <year> after which no cat @-@ killed kakapo were found
however to ensure the survival of the remaining birds scientists decided later that this population should be transferred to predator @-@ free islands this operation was carried out between <year> and <year>
the new zealand department of conservation replaced the wildlife service for this task
the first action of the plan was to relocate all the remaining kakapo to suitable islands for them to breed
none of the new zealand islands were ideal to establish kakapo without rehabilitation by extensive re @-@ vegetation and the eradication of introduced mammalian predators and competitors
four islands were finally chosen maud hauturu little barrier codfish and mana
sixty @-@ five kakapo <num> males <num> females were successfully transferred onto the four islands in five translocations
some islands had to be rehabilitated several times when feral cats stoats and weka kept appearing
little barrier island was eventually viewed as unsuitable due to the rugged landscape the thick forest and the continued presence of rats and its birds were evacuated in <year>
along with mana island it was replaced with two new kakapo sanctuaries chalky island te kakahu and anchor island
the entire kakapo population of codfish island was temporarily relocated in <year> to pearl island in port pegasus while rats were being eliminated from codfish
all kakapo on pearl and chalky islands were moved to anchor island in <year>
a key part of the recovery plan is the supplementary feeding of females
the kakapo breeds only once every two to five years when a certain type of plant species primarily dacrydium cupressinum rimu produces protein @-@ rich fruit and seeds
observations of the relationship between intermittent breeding and the plant 's mast year help biologists choose which suitable supplementary foods to increase kakapo breeding frequency
in <year> six preferred foods apples sweet potatoes almonds brazil nuts sunflower seeds and walnuts were supplied ad libitum each night to <num> feeding stations
males and females ate the supplied foods and females nested on little barrier island in the summers of <year> – <num> for the first time since <year> although nesting success was low
supplementary feeding not only increases kakapo breeding frequency but also affects the sex ratio of kakapo offspring as maternal conditions influence this ratio
see section reproduction
this finding was subsequently used to increase the number of female chicks by deliberately manipulating maternal conditions
during the winter of <year> only females lighter than <num>
<num> kg <num>
<num> lb were given supplementary feeding to avoid raising their body condition and the sex ratio results in <year> were close to parity eliminating the male @-@ biased sex ratios in the unrestricted feeding
though breeding can be improved by supplementary feeding the survival of young kakapo is hampered by the presence of polynesian rats
of <num> chicks that hatched between <year> and <year> nine were either killed by rats or died and were subsequently eaten by rats
nest protection has been intensified since <year> by using traps and poison stations as soon as a nest had been detected
a small video camera and infra @-@ red light source watch the nest continuously and will scare approaching rats with flashing lights and loud popping sounds
to increase the success rate of nesting a nest watcher places a small thermostatically controlled electric blanket over the eggs or chicks whenever the female leaves the nest for food
the survival rate of chicks has increased from <num> in unprotected nests to <num> in protected ones
to monitor the kakapo population continuously each bird is equipped with a radio transmitter
every known kakapo barring some young chicks has been given a name by kakapo recovery programme officials
it is an affectionate way for conservation staff to refer to individual birds and a stark reminder of how few remain
artificial incubation of eggs and hand @-@ raising of chicks have often been used to improve the condition of the eggs and chicks
in november <year> the population comprised <num> females and <num> males including four fledglings <num> females and <num> male bred in <year>
the oldest known kakapo richard henry was thought to be <num> years old at the time of his death in december <year>
in <year> the kakapo recovery programme presented a new management plan that would run from <year> to <year>
the key goals of this plan are to increase the female population to at least <num> by <year> increase genetic diversity maintain or restore a sufficiently large habitat to accommodate the expected increase in the kakapo population and maintain public awareness and support
the kakapo recovery programme has been successful with the numbers of kakapo increasing steadily
adult survival rate and productivity have both improved significantly since the programme 's inception
however the main goal is to establish at least one viable self @-@ sustaining unmanaged population of kakapo as a functional component of the ecosystem in a protected habitat
to help meet this conservation challenge two large fiordland islands resolution <num> @,@ <num> ha and secretary <num> @,@ <num> ha have been prepared for re @-@ introduction of the kakapo with large @-@ scale ecological restoration activities
ultimately the kakapo recovery vision for the species is to restore the mauri maori for life @-@ force of the kakapo by breeding <num> adult females
during the <year> – <year> summer breeding season the total population of kakapo rose to over <num> for the first time since monitoring began reaching <num> by february <year>
twenty two of the <num> chicks had to be hand @-@ reared because of a shortage of food on codfish island
in <year> seven kakapo were transferred to little barrier island in an attempt to establish a successful breeding programme
kakapo were last on the island in <year>
in march <year> with the kakapo population having increased to <num> the bird 's recovery was used by melbourne artist sayraphim lothian as a metaphor for the recovery of christchurch parallelling the indomitable spirit of these two communities and their determination to rebuild
the bird 's irregular breeding cycle was understood to be associated with heavy fruiting or masting events of particular plant species such as the rimu which led māori to credit the bird with the ability to tell the future
used to substantiate this claim were reported observations of these birds dropping the berries of the hinau and tawa trees when they were in season into secluded pools of water to preserve them as a food supply for the summer ahead in legend this became the origin of the māori practice of immersing food in water for the same purpose
one source states that its flesh resembles lamb in taste and texture although european settlers have described the bird as having a strong and slightly stringent sic flavour
in breeding years the loud booming calls of the males at their mating arenas made it easy for māori hunting parties to track the kakapo down and it was also hunted while feeding or when dust @-@ bathing in dry weather
the bird was caught generally at night using snares pitfall traps or by groups of domesticated polynesian dogs which accompanied hunting parties – sometimes they would use fire sticks of various sorts to dazzle a bird in the darkness stopping it in their tracks and making the capture easier
cooking was done in a hāngi or in gourds of boiling oil
the flesh of the bird could be preserved in its own fat and stored in containers for later consumption – hunters of the ngāi tahu tribe would pack the flesh in baskets made from the inner bark of totara tree or in containers constructed from kelp
bundles of kakapo tail feathers were attached to the sides of these containers to provide decoration and a way to identify their contents
also taken by the māori were the bird 's eggs which are described as whitish but not pure white and about the same size as a kererū egg
as well as eating the meat of the kakapo māori would use kakapo skins with the feathers still attached or individually weave in kakapo feathers with flax fibre to create cloaks and capes
each one required up to <num> @,@ <num> feathers to make
not only were these garments considered very beautiful they also kept the wearer very warm
they were highly valued and the few still in existence today are considered taonga treasures — indeed the old māori adage you have a kākāpō cape and you still complain of the cold was used to describe someone who is never satisfied
kakapo feathers were also used to decorate the heads of taiaha but were removed before use in combat
despite this the kakapo was also regarded as an affectionate pet by the māori
this was corroborated by european settlers in new zealand in the <num> century among them george edward grey who once wrote in a letter to an associate that his pet kakapo 's behaviour towards him and his friends was more like that of a dog than a bird
many books and documentaries detailing the plight of the kakapo have been produced in recent years one of the earliest being two in the bush made by gerald durrell for the bbc in <year>
a feature @-@ length documentary the unnatural history of the kakapo won two major awards at the reel earth environmental film festival
two of the most significant documentaries both made by nhnz are kakapo – night parrot <year> and to save the kakapo <year>
the bbc 's natural history unit also featured the kakapo including a sequence with sir david attenborough in the life of birds
it was also one of the endangered animals douglas adams and mark carwardine set out to find for the radio series and book last chance to see
an updated version of the series has been produced for bbc tv in which stephen fry and carwardine revisit the animals to see how they are getting on almost <num> years later and in january <year> they spent time filming the kakapo on codfish island
footage of a kakapo named sirocco attempting to mate with carwardine 's head was viewed by millions worldwide leading to sirocco becoming spokes @-@ bird for new zealand wildlife conservation in <year> as part of the international year of biodiversity
the kakapo was featured in the episode strange islands of the documentary series south pacific originally aired on <num> june <year>
kakapo were also used as an example of unique island fauna in the episode worlds apart of the series the living planet
the fourth in a succession of saturday morning shows it was the replacement for going live and took many of its features from it such as phone @-@ ins games comedy competitions and the showing of cartoons
once live kicking had become established in series two it reached its height in popularity during series four when it was presented by zoë ball and jamie theakston their final episode won a bafta award
after this the series ratings dropped with the launch of smtv live on itv and was eventually cancelled in <year>
it was first broadcast on <num> october <year> at <num> am on bbc1
the original hosts were andi peters emma forbes who had presented a cookery segment in going live and john barrowman
for the second series john was relegated to host the showbiz electric circus segment leaving andi and emma to become the main hosts
he left after one series of electric circus to concentrate on acting
comedy duo trevor and simon and peter simon in the run the risk segment were also regulars who had featured on going live
while the first series was not as popular as its predecessor the second series was more successful
it was broadcast during the winter months from september to april with fully booked replacing it during the summer
new episodes of the rugrats were shown
the series went out opposite itv 's what 's up doc but during its third series issues were raised by the itc and a number of people left including don austen and john eccleston bro and bro 's puppeteers who defected to live kicking to star as a couple of leprechaun brothers sage onion
andi peters expressed his intention to move on in march <year> and emma forbes decided to follow after finding out she was pregnant
