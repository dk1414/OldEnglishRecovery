they were replaced by zoë ball and jamie theakston who presented it for three series
according to the bbc the show 's popularity was at its peak during the <year> <year> series when the show regularly had <num>
<num> million viewers
around this time mr
blobby played by barry killerby also appered on series
after three series ball decided to move on due to a hectic schedule and theakston followed
the final episode hosted by ball and theakston later won the show a children 's bafta award for best entertainment show in november <year>
the show returned in autumn <year> with new presenters emma ledden and steve wilson
they only lasted for one series due to ratings dropping to <num>
<num> million during their tenure
at the same time rival smtv live on competitor channel itv was relaunched to feature more comedic elements and began to gain popularity known for its innuendo and features
fully booked the bbc 's summer replacement was also revamped and retitled as fbi but ratings continued to drop
the following october the final series was a complete revamp with a line @-@ up of four ortis deley katy hill trey farley and sarah cawood
ratings continued to plummet due to the continuing success of smtv live
in march <year> the bbc made an unprecedented move and extended the series over the summer like smtv was broadcast but announced it would be the final series
hill was replaced by heather suttie as the show was moved to bbc scotland on <num> april until <num> september <year> when the final show aired
it was replaced by the saturday show which continued to be broadcast all year round
it featured music performances hot seat questions for celebrity guests phone @-@ ins games comedy sketches competitions and television programmes and cartoons
it used the taglines miss it miss out and the only way to start your weekend on promotional adverts for the show
as well as the main presenters there were regulars such as comedy duo trevor and simon and later ben gez and rich from the cheese shop and supergirly
a segment in the first few series that was an adaptation of going live 's double dare was run the risk a game in which teams of children completed various obstacle courses and challenges
gunge was often included to make the tasks harder
run the risk was later broadcast separately
from <year> until <year> there was a showbiz segment called the electric circus which featured the latest films music computer games and gossip
it was first presented by john barrowman after he stepped aside as a regular presenter and was later hosted by a variety of people
the first series featured the computerised head of a cat named ratz who provided links but this was dropped after one series
it was replaced by commentator mitch johnson who as well as providing commentary and links for each item would interact with both audience and presenters too
from the second series two puppet leprachauns later named as sage and onion became regulars
they were played by don austen and john eccleston and were designed and built by darryl worbey studios
they performed comedy sketches throughout the morning and often interacted with the people in the studio
another comedy character who first appeared in the third series was mr blobby who had previously appeared in noel 's house party
most regular features were dropped for the final series when the show was revamped
a feature that stuck throughout was the jingle for the phone number first <num> <num> <num> then <num> <num> <num> then <num> <num> <year>
as well as the television show live and kicking launched a music cd composed of the best music that artists had sung live on the programme
a video game called live and kicking showmaker was also created where the user could combine elements of the show to create their own television production on a small scale
a monthly magazine was also produced though towards the end of live kicking 's production the sales of the magazine dropped significantly reflecting its loss of viewers
for series five and six there was a short version of the show that aired on friday afternoons called l k friday but this was cancelled after two series
the regular saturday presenters jamie theakston and zoë ball presented the first series and steve wilson and liz fraser presented the second series
a <num> @-@ minute version of the show also aired on bbc choice and was entitled l k replay
in may <year> two months before steve emma were officially resigned from live kicking the show was brought back for a one @-@ off special during the summer break
it was to mix in with the bbc 's music live and the show was titled as music live kicking with steve emma returning to present along with future presenter ortis deley and special guest presenter stephen gately of boyzone
this special was dedicated to a series of music performances hence the title and was the first edition to be broadcast in widescreen
one of the last features was l k castaway a spin @-@ off of the bbc reality show castaway <year>
each week six children would spend four days on a remote scottish island learning how to survive among other skills
points were earned through passing various tasks and were lost if contestants entered the temptation hut which contained various modern electrical appliances
after their final series in <year> it was believed the bbc would replace live kicking with another programme as its two predecessors had both lasted six years
instead they continued with live kicking with new presenters emma ledden and steve wilson
the series was the beginning of the end for the show ledden and wilson did not know each other at the start of the series and so there was none of the interaction between them as seen between ball and theakston
additionally smtv live which broadcast opposite on itv was slowly becoming more popular and gaining the audience the bbc was losing
after just one series ledden and wilson 's contracts were not renewed
wilson later said that they were dropped just as they were starting to form a relationship and that ant dec presenters of smtv live had the edge over them as they had known each other much longer
ledden had already been dropped when wilson went through several meetings with the bbc
he decided it was better to leave after one good series rather than do a second lame series and went on to appear in rival smtv live 's <num> show in the friends skit chums
when live kicking returned in october <year> it was completely revamped with brand new titles and a line @-@ up of four presenters
however this did nothing to increase viewing figures and the chemistry between the presenters was even less apparent
it was decided not to end the show in april and replace it with a summer show because the replacement fbi had lost even more viewers for the bbc
live kicking continued until september after a move to glasgow where the summer show had normally been filmed
just before the move it was announced it would be the final series
the principal reason given for the decision was the increasing loss of viewers to smtv live which had a similar format and was more successful
live and kicking was replaced by the saturday show fronted by dani behr and joe mace which was shown all year round until september <year> when it began an autumn @-@ spring summer loop with dick and dom in da bungalow
live kicking was featured in the bbc 's it started with swap shop programme in <year> where noel edmonds interviewed the first pair of presenters andi peters and emma forbes about their time on the show
considered one of the hawaiʻi sons of the civil war he was among a group of more than one hundred documented native hawaiian and hawaii @-@ born combatants who fought in the american civil war while the kingdom of hawaiʻi was still an independent nation
born and raised in hilo hawaiʻi he was the eldest son of kinoʻoleoliliha a hawaiian high chiefess and benjamin pitman an american pioneer settler from massachusetts
through his father 's business success in the whaling and sugar and coffee plantation industries and his mother 's familial connections to the hawaiian royal family the pitmans were quite prosperous and owned lands on the island of hawaiʻi and in honolulu
he and his older sister were educated in the mission schools in hilo alongside other children of mixed hawaiian descent
after the death of his mother in <year> his father remarried to the widow of a missionary thus connecting the family to the american missionary community in hawaiʻi
however following the deaths of his first wife and later his second wife his father decided to leave the islands and returned to massachusetts with his family around <year>
he continued his education in the public schools of roxbury where the pitman family lived for a period of time
leaving school without his family 's knowledge he made the decision to fight in the civil war in august <year>
despite his mixed @-@ race ancestry pitman avoided the racial segregation imposed on other native hawaiian recruits of the time and enlisted in the <num> regiment massachusetts volunteer infantry a white regiment
he served as a private in the union army fighting in the battle of antietam and the maryland campaign
in his company private robert g
carter befriended the part @-@ hawaiian soldier and wrote in later life of their common experience in the <num> massachusetts
compiled decades afterward from old letters carter 's account described the details surrounding his final fate in the war
on the march to fredericksburg pitman was separated from his regiment and captured by confederate guerrilla forces
he was forced to march to richmond and incarcerated in the confederate libby prison where he contracted lung fever from the harsh conditions of his imprisonment and died on february <num> <year> a few months after his release on parole in a prisoner exchange
modern historians consider henry hoʻolulu pitman to be the only known hawaiian or pacific islander to die as a prisoner of war in the civil war
for a period of time after the end of the war the legacy and contributions of pitman and other documented hawaiian participants in the american civil war were largely forgotten except in the private circles of descendants and historians
however there has been a revival of interest in recent years in the hawaiian community
in <year> these hawaiʻi sons of the civil war were commemorated with a bronze plaque erected along the memorial pathway at the national memorial cemetery of the pacific in honolulu
originally a native of salem massachusetts pitman 's father was an early pioneer businessman and sugar and coffee plantation owner on the island of hawaiʻi who profited greatly from the kingdom 's booming whaling industry in the early <num>
on his father 's side he was a great @-@ grandson of joshua pitman <year> – <year> an english @-@ american carpenter on the ship  franklin  under captain allen hallett during the american revolutionary war
on his mother 's side pitman was a descendant of kameʻeiamoku one of the royal twins with kamanawa who advised kamehameha i in his conquest of the hawaiian islands and also of the early american or english sea captain harold cox who lent his name to george cox kahekili keʻeaumoku ii the governor of maui
henry hoʻolulu pitman shared his hawaiian name with his maternal grandfather hoʻolulu who along with his brother hoapili helped conceal the bones of king kamehameha i in a secret hiding place after his death
in the hawaiian language the name hoʻolulu means to be calm as a ship in a protected harbor
his siblings were mary ann pitman ailau <year> – <year> benjamin keolaokalani franklin pitman <year> – <year> and half @-@ sister maria kinoʻole pitman morey <year> – <year>
because of his father 's success in business and his mother 's descent from hawaiian royalty the pitman family was considered quite prosperous and were host to the royal family when they visited hilo
besides being one of the leading merchants in town his father also served the government as district magistrate of hilo
henry 's mother kinoʻole had inherited control over much of the lands in hilo and ōlaʻa from her own father and king kamehameha iii had granted her use of the ahupuaʻa of hilo after her marriage
during henry 's early childhood the family lived in the mansion that benjamin pitman had built in <year> in an area known as niopola one of the favored resort spots of ancient hawaiian royalty
the residence also became known as the spencer house after pitman sold it to his business partner captain thomas spencer
the property later became the site of the hilo hotel built in <year> and torn down in <year>
in the <num> the family moved to the capital of honolulu where benjamin pitman took up banking and built a beautiful two @-@ story house that he named waialeale rippling water at the corner of alakea and beretania streets
wetmore 's children 's school in hilo
the school was located at the wetmores residence on church street
taught by lucy sheldon taylor wetmore the wife of american missionary doctor and government physician charles hinckley wetmore the two elder pitman children received their education in english rather than hawaiian
this was unusual since hawaiian was the official language of the kingdom of hawaiʻi and all other schools in hilo were conducted in the hawaiian language
mrs
wetmore taught the children reading writing spelling arithmetic and singing while also reinforcing the curriculum with a strong adherence to the principles of the protestant faith
like the pitman siblings many of their classmates were also of half @-@ hawaiian hapa @-@ kanaka descent with a majority of them being chinese @-@ hawaiians hapa @-@ pake
after the death of his mother kinoʻole in <year> pitman 's father remarried to maria louisa walsworth kinney the widow of american missionary rev
henry kinney
the kinneys were part of the twelfth company of missionaries from the american board of commissioners for foreign missions to arrive in <year>
the marriage aligned the pitman children with the american missionary community
they were called cousins by the children of the missionaries and considered part of the extended missionary family of hawaiʻi
this first stepmother died in <year> after giving birth to their father 's fourth child a daughter named maria kinoʻole <year> – <year>
the pitman family returned to massachusetts in <year> where his father remarried to his third wife martha ball giving his four children another stepmother
according to an <year> biography written by robert g
carter a private who would later serve in the same company as pitman he was neglected after his mother 's death by his father and stepmother who subjected him to neglect and treatment that with his sensitive nature he could not bear
he continued his education in the public schools of roxbury where the pitman family lived for a period of time
the <year> united states census registered pitman under his teacher solomon adams as residing and presumably being educated in newton also in the boston area
growing into adolescence he was said to strongly resemble his hawaiian mother
robert g
carter gave a brief description of his appearance in wartime letters first published in <year> a tall slim boy straight as an arrow
his face was a perfect oval his hair was as black as a raven 's wing and his eyes were large and of that peculiar soft melting blackness which excites pity when one is in distress
his skin was a clear dark olive bordering on the swarthy and this with his high cheek bones would have led us to suppose that his nationality was different from our own had we not known that his name was plain henry p
there was an air of good breeding and refinement about him that with his small hands and feet would have set us to thinking had it not been that in our youth and intensely enthusiastic natures we gave no thought to our comrades personal appearance
we can look back now and see the shy reserved nature of the boy the dark melancholy eyes the sad smile the sensitive twitching of the lips
but many native hawaiians and hawaiian @-@ born americans mainly descendants of the american missionaries both abroad and in the islands volunteered and enlisted in the military regiments of various states in the union and the confederacy
individual native hawaiians had been serving in the united states navy and army since the war of <year> and even more served during the american civil war
many hawaiians sympathized with the union because of hawaiʻi 's ties to new england through its missionaries and the whaling industries and the ideological opposition of many to the institution of slavery
he apparently never informed his family in advance about the choice to join the war because the news of his enlistment was reported back in hawaiʻi 's american missionary community as henry pitman has run away from home and gone to war
carter described pitman 's rationale for enlisting in the midst of the clamor of war when the very air vibrated with excitement the wild enthusiasm of the crowds and the inspiring sound of the drum his indian nature rose within him
his resolve was made
pitman was a hapa @-@ haole of part hawaiian and part caucasian descent
his father was white and his native @-@ born mother was also part caucasian from her own mother who was the daughter of captain cox and a hawaiian chiefess
despite his mixed @-@ race ancestry pitman avoided the racial segregation imposed on other native hawaiian volunteers in this period
most native hawaiians who participated in the war were assigned to colored regiments but pitman 's fair skin color meant he was able to serve in a white unit indicating that unit assignment may have been influenced by how dark hawaiians appeared
historians bob dye james l
haley and others claimed pitman was placed in the colored regiments because of his mixed race but regiment records indicate otherwise
pitman served as a private in the <num> regiment massachusetts volunteer infantry company h
this regiment was also named the henry wilson 's regiment after col
henry wilson who commanded the unit in <year>
col
william s
tilton was the commander during pitman 's brief term of service
the regiment was part of the v corps of the army of the potomac under the command of major general george b
mcclellan
during this period the regiment fought in the second battle of bull run and was involved in the maryland campaign fighting in the battle of antietam the bloodiest single @-@ day battle in american history and the battle of shepherdstown
his regiment was on the march to the battle of fredericksburg when pitman was captured by confederate troops
carter
in november <year> pitman was captured near warrenton junction on the march toward fredericksburg virginia during the weeks prior to the battle of fredericksburg
he had fallen behind the group because his feet had blistered and swollen due to the tightness of a pair of thin high @-@ heeled and narrow soled boots he had purchased
one of his comrades temporarily stayed behind to care for him but later decided to move on with the rest of the camp for fear of disciplinary consequences of falling out without authority
he was urged to move on but without much success
pitman 's last words to his comrade were i will be in camp by night good by
his fellow soldiers never saw him again and considered him missing
shortly after he was left a band of confederate guerrillas under colonel john s
mosby captured the weary and defenseless soldier without a struggle
the inscription on his tombstone differs slightly from carter 's account stating he was captured by j
e
b
stuart 's cavalry instead
after pitman 's capture he was marched to richmond in a weak physical state
he was imprisoned in the confederate libby prison and belle isle which were notoriously harsh prisons
pitman 's letters home described his place of incarceration as the pen where the filthy meat was thrown to them as if they were dogs
the condition of his incarceration including the shortage of food lack of sanitation overcrowding and his physical weakness made him susceptible to virulent diseases present in the confederate prisons
carter described how the prisons wore out the brave spirit
during a prisoner exchange pitman was released by the confederate army at city point virginia on december <num> <year> and then sent to annapolis parole camp
suffering from complications due to the conditions of his imprisonment he contracted lung fever which was perhaps pneumonia
carter wrote later how his friend had linger ed feebly a few weeks like the flickering of an expiring flame then quietly pass ed away to an eternal life
pitman died at parole camp on february <num> <year> just weeks short of his eighteenth birthday
according to historians anita manning and justin vance pitman has the unfortunate distinction of being the only known hawaiian or pacific islander to die as a prisoner of war in the civil war
considering him missing pitman 's regiment did not discover his final fate until news of his funeral at roxbury was received in the spring of the following year
his remains were returned to his family in massachusetts after his death in parole camp
benjamin pitman his father had him buried in a family plot in mount auburn cemetery
on one side of the pitman family grave marker was placed the inscription timothy henry pitman born at hilo hawaii mar

during a return to hawaiʻi in <year> his younger brother benjamin keolaokalani franklin pitman and his wife almira hollander pitman discovered a grandson of a nephew was named kealiʻi i kaua i pakoma meaning chief that fought the potomac in honor of his deceased older brother
similarly henry hoʻolulu pitman beckley the second son of his hawaiian first cousin george charles moʻoheau beckley was also named after him
shortly after his death pitman was eulogized back in hawaiʻi by martha ann chamberlain corresponding secretary of the hawaiian mission children 's society our cousin henry pitman the first of hawaii 's sons to fall in the war died at annapolis parole camp feb
<num> of lung fever serving as a soldier in the union army
his remains were deposited in mt
auburn cemetery near boston mass
he died in a just cause
let his memory be embalmed among our band
after the war the military service of hawaiians including henry hoʻolulu pitman were largely forgotten disappearing from the collective memories of the american civil war and the history of hawaiʻi
however in recent years hawaiian residents and historians and descendants of hawaiian combatants in the conflict have insisted on the need to remember our boys from hawaii
renewed interest in the stories of these individuals and this particular period of hawaiian @-@ american history have inspired efforts to preserve the memories of the hawaiians who served in the war
on august <num> <year> on the anniversary of the signing of the hawaiian neutrality proclamation a bronze plaque was erected along the memorial pathway at the national memorial cemetery of the pacific in honolulu recognizing these hawaiʻi sons of the civil war the more than one hundred documented hawaiians who served during the american civil war for both the union and the confederacy
pitman 's great @-@ grandniece diane kinoʻole o liliha pitman spieler attended the ceremony
pitman spieler stated i 'm very proud of a young man of his age – he was quite young – who served in the civil war for his family
in <year> todd ocvirk nanette napoleon justin vance anita manning and others began the process of creating a historical documentary about the individual experiences and stories of hawaii @-@ born soldiers and sailors of the american civil war including pitman samuel c
armstrong nathaniel bright emerson james wood bush j

kealoha and many other unnamed combatants of both the union and the confederacy
in <year> maui @-@ based author wayne moniz wrote a fictionalized story based on the lives and civil war service of hawaiian soldiers like henry hoʻolulu pitman in his book pukoko a hawaiian in the american civil war
in <year> the sesquicentennial of the end of the war the national park service released a publication titled asians and pacific islanders and the civil war about the service of the large number of combatants of asian and pacific islander descent who fought during the war
the history of hawaiʻi 's involvement and the biographies of pitman bush kealoha and others were co @-@ written by historians anita manning and justin vance
part of the ancient nesebar unesco world heritage site the church of christ pantocrator was constructed in the <num> – <num> century and is best known for its lavish exterior decoration
the church today an art gallery survives largely intact and is among bulgaria 's best preserved churches of the middle ages
university of pennsylvania scholar robert g
ousterhout places its construction in the mid @-@ <num> century
rough guides author jonathan bousfield attributes its building to the rule of tsar ivan alexander of bulgaria r
<num> – <num> though during this time control of nesebar changed many times between the second bulgarian empire and byzantium
the church is dedicated to christ pantocrator a name of god which hails him as the ruler of all in greek
the church is located on mesembria street near the entrance to nesebar 's old town
nowadays it houses an art gallery which exhibits works by bulgarian artists
as it belongs to the old town of nesebar the church of christ pantocrator forms part of the ancient city of nesebar unesco world heritage site and the <num> tourist sites of bulgaria
since <year> it has been under state protection as a national antiquity and it was listed among bulgaria 's monuments of culture of national importance in <year>
it was constructed from stones and brickwork a construction technique known as opus mixtum and measures <num> by <num>
<num> metres <num>
<num> ft × <num>
<num> ft <num> by <num>
<num> metres <num>
<num> ft × <num>
<num> ft or <num>
<num> by <num>
<num> metres <num>
<num> ft × <num>
<num> ft depending on the source
the walls of the church are <num>
<num> metres <num>
<num> ft thick
the colour of the bricks gives the church a ruddy appearance
the church features a narthex and a cella or naos with an essentially rectangular elongated plan
the narthex is small but has a medieval tomb underneath it
there are four entrances to the church two accessing the cella from the south and west and another two for the narthex from the west and north
the apse of the church has three small parts which overlap each other to form a single larger unit
the prothesis and diaconicon of the church are located by the apse
the dome octagonal in shape stands prominently on top of the centre of the cella
it was supported by four now @-@ destroyed columns which were located directly beneath it
the integrated bell tower has been built on top of the narthex as was customary in contemporary byzantine church architecture and extends from the rectangular main structure
the bell tower was originally rectangular though it is now partially ruined
it was reached from the south by means of a stone staircase
the most lavishly decorated part of the church is the east side with the apse and as a whole all sides of the church exhibit different ornamentation
interchanging strips of three or four rows of bricks and carved stones which create an optical pattern are the most basic type of decoration used
rows of blind arches four @-@ leaved floral motifs triangular ornaments circular turquoise ceramics and brick swastika friezes run along the east wall
ousterhout likens the appearance of the church 's superimposed arcades to an aqueduct an earlier example of that configuration can be observed in the cappadocian church of çanlı kilise near aksaray turkey
the inclusion of swastikas in the decoration is considered unusual and curious to tourists
it is explained by the medieval use of the swastika as a symbol of the sun
the decoration of the elongated north and south walls includes brick blind arches in the bottom part and a large arch for each wall adjacent to the dome with a columned window in the middle
there are windows above the lower arches of the north and south facade
the dome which also exhibits a large number of ornamental details and ceramics features eight windows one for each of its sides
the medieval frescoes which were painted on the interior walls of the church have been only fragmentarily preserved
it was writer michael sussman 's third episode of the season while it was director david livingston 's second
the episode was the third in a three @-@ part story arc following on from the episodes the forge and awakening
kir 'shara and the vulcan arc showed themes relating to the protestant reformation resulting in comparisons to books such as the da vinci code and the celestine prophecy while the kir 'shara itself was compared to the nag hammadi library
set in the <num> century the series follows the adventures of the first starfleet starship enterprise registration nx @-@ <num>
in this episode enterprise attempts to avert a war and is caught in a crossfire between vulcan and andorian starships
meanwhile
captain archer commander t 'pol and t 'pau aim to take the kir 'shara to the vulcan capital and use it to reveal administrator v 'las plot to the rest of the vulcan high command
in addition to the guest stars returning from the previous arc episodes or the episode home jeffrey combs returned as shran
the episode was shot across seven days using mostly standing sets with only an andorian brig built specifically for this episode
kir 'shara also saw the return of the vulcan lirpa a weapon which had been first introduced in the star trek the original series episode amok time
the episode originally aired on december <num> <year> on upn
it received a nielsen rating of <num>
<num> <num> percent which equalled the highest ratings seen during the fourth season
it was warmly received by critics who praised combs performance and noted that this episode was an indication of the improving quality of the series
however there was mixed opinion regarding the ending of the episode
soval guides enterprise to a nebula where the andorian fleet is hiding
commander shran is dubious and abducts and tortures soval
after believing him enterprise joins a fleet of six andorian ships to intercept the vulcans
commander tucker attempts to buy time by ordering enterprise directly between the two fleets — this works for a while until administrator v 'las orders them to be targeted too
meanwhile at the forge captain archer commander t 'pol and t 'pau having found the sacred kir 'shara which the syrrannites believe will usher a vulcan enlightenment endeavor to take it to the capital
en route t 'pol and t 'pau discuss the taboo of mind @-@ melds and t 'pau offers to mind @-@ meld with t 'pol
she states the meld is safe when performed by those trained in the art and that pa 'nar syndrome is merely the by @-@ product of an improperly conducted meld
the trio are then attacked by major talok and vulcan commandos and t 'pol is captured while the others escape
she tells her captors that they are headed to mount seleya in order to mislead them from their true destination
she is then taken to the capital
archer and t 'pau also arrive after t 'pol 's husband koss provides transporter security codes
they present the kir 'shara to the command and reveal that the embassy bombing was merely a pretext to weaken the pacifist syrranites prior to the andorian strike
visibly angered v 'las lunges for the kir 'shara but is stunned by high @-@ minister kuvak who orders the fleet to stand down
enterprise returns to vulcan and koss visits to release t 'pol from their marriage
meanwhile the vulcan high command is dissolved granting earth greater autonomy and the katra of surak is transferred to a vulcan high priest
v 'las relieved of his post meets secretly with talok revealed as a romulan agent who states that the reunification of their worlds is only a matter of time
david livingston directed the episode which was his second episode of the season having previously directed borderland
most of the guest stars had appeared in the previous episode awakening including robert foxworth as administrator v 'las kara zediker as t 'pau and john rubinstein as kuvak
in addition michael reilly burke resumes his role as koss for the third time having appeared in the role both in home and the forge
also appearing having appeared in home was jack donner as a vulcan priest
donner appeared in the original series episode the enterprise incident as the romulan commander subcommander tal
kir 'shara also saw the return of jeffrey combs as the andorian commander shran for the sixth time as well as gary graham as ambassador soval who has appeared as a recurring character in enterprise since the pilot episode broken bow
filming began on october <num> <year> and continued until october <num>
despite the desert locations all filming took place on soundstages
these represented a variety of places throughout the vulcan desert @-@ like forge
the remaining sets used were either standing sets or those which had been constructed for the previous two episodes
the exceptions to that were two sets to represent scenes on board commander shran 's andorian vessel
the andorian bridge set which had been used previously in the series had a single wall brought out of storage in order to appear as a backdrop for shran when he appears on the enterprise viewscreen
the andorian brig was built specifically for this episode for scenes with shran and soval
re @-@ appearing in kir 'shara were the traditional vulcan weapon the lirpa which was first introduced in the original series episode amok time
the lirpa is a long shaft with a crescent blade on one end and a spiked cudgel on the other
brand new props were built for this episode modifying the original design by making them more lightweight
they were wielded in kir 'shara by vulcan commandos who were all played by stunt actors in non @-@ speaking roles
additional stunt doubles were required for archer t 'pol t 'pau and talok while two puppeteers were needed for the andorian antennae seen on screen
the forge sees captain jonathan archer scott bakula and t 'pol jolene blalock travel into the vulcan desert known as the forge in order to find a renegade faction of vulcans known as the syrrannites
during the journey archer has the katra of surak transferred into him
in awakening the duo meet the syrrannites and find out they are peaceful
after enterprise leaves orbit the vulcans start bombarding the caves where the syrrannites are located killing t 'pol 's mother t 'les joanna cassidy
speaking about awakening show runner manny coto had previously said that he envisaged the story arc to be about a vulcan reformation as a metaphor to the real @-@ world <num> century protestant reformation with t 'pau playing the role of martin luther
this view was supported by the <year> book star trek as myth which saw the original vulcan religion prior to the reformation arc seen from the forge onwards as equating to the catholic church while the syrannites were the protestants
in doing so administrator v 'las is therefore linked to the anti @-@ christ in much the same way that the protestant reformation saw the pope as the anti @-@ christ
in this role the romulans in the story take the place of the subversive devils to form an unholy alliance
it was also suggested that the kir 'shara itself was similar in context to the nag hammadi library which was a collection of thirteen codices found in nag hammadi egypt in <year> that date back to between the <num> to <num> centuries
unlike those codices the vulcan high council attempts to suppress the revelation of the kir 'shara in a similar manner to the catholic church 's suppression seen in other fictional works such as dan brown 's the da vinci code or james redfield 's the celestine prophecy
the broadcast saw the episode come in fourth place during the timeslot with a nielsen rating of <num>
<num> <num> percent
this means that it was seen by <num>
<num> percent of all households and <num> percent of all those watching television at the time of broadcast
it gained higher ratings than the wb who aired what i like about you and grounded for life
the ratings equalled the highest ratings of the season so far which were previously achieved by borderland cold station <num> and the augments
tv guide listed kir 'shara on its hot list for the day while the preview by ign said that the show finally grows up and becomes a star trek series this week
it described kir 'shara as far from a perfectly executed trek story but they get enough right to make it a lot easier to overlook the few things they miss
it said that there had been an overall improvement in the fourth season and that this could become some of the best star trek ever made
it gave kir 'shara a rating of four and a half out of five
in matthew kappell 's book star trek as myth he said that he felt that the revelation that the previous vulcan administration was working with the romulans all along suddenly makes sense of years of previously incomprehensible vulcan policy and linked to the next generation episode unification
herc in his review for ain 't it cool news praised the reliability of jeffrey combs as shran but thought that there were no major surprises
herc did say that the biggest shock was the revelation that the romulans were behind the bombing of the human embassy
he gave it a rating of three out of five
michelle erica green reviewed the episode for treknation calling it an absolutely gripping episode except for the ludicrousness of the ending
she made the admission about the ending that i suppose the romulans had to show up at some point i guess vulcan is as good a place as any
she thought that the torture scenes were pointless but was pleased with the characterisation seen in archer t 'pol and tucker
jamahl epsicokhan at his website jammer 's reviews said that the episode was not perfect but good with an intriguing ending
he also praised jeffrey combs as shran and thought that the torture screens were potent but that the ending was rushed
he gave the episode a rating of three out of four

warren had no qualifications or formal training to be a police officer and was given the job because everyone on the island had a job
the island 's jail was described as the size of a garden shed and riddled with termites and its cells had been used to store building materials and lifejackets
when the island came into the international spotlight due to a sexual abuse scandal a law enforcement professional sent to the island criticized their practices stating it was glaringly obvious

as a radio operator she broadcasts under the call sign vp6mw
she claimed that young girls on pitcairn customarily became sexually active after age <num> a practice of underage sex that had been accepted as a polynesian tradition since the settlement of the island in <year>
one resident olive christian said of her girlhood we all thought sex was like food on the table
many pitcairn island men blamed the british police for persuading the women involved to press charges
some of the women agreed and advocated a conspiracy theory that the trial was in warren 's words a british plot to jail the community 's able @-@ bodied men and close the island and that the british officials picked on all the viable young men the ones who are the backbone of this place
a majority of the island 's residents denied or excused the allegations

that is it consists of finitely many vertices and edges with each edge directed from one vertex to another such that there is no way to start at any vertex v and follow a consistently @-@ directed sequence of edges that eventually loops back to v again
equivalently a dag is a directed graph that has a topological ordering a sequence of the vertices such that every edge is directed from earlier to later in the sequence
dags may be used to model many different kinds of information
the reachability relation in a dag forms a partial order and any finite partial order may be represented by a dag using reachability
the program evaluation and review technique uses dags to model the milestones and activities of large human projects and schedule these projects to use as little total time as possible
scheduling of computer operations such as the updates to a spreadsheet or the compilation operations in a makefile can also be performed using topological orderings of dags
combinational logic blocks in electronic circuit design and the operations in dataflow programming languages involve acyclic networks of processing elements
dags can also represent collections of events and their influence on each other either in a probabilistic structure such as a bayesian network or as a record of historical data such as family trees or the version histories of distributed revision control systems
dags can also be used as a compact representation of sequence data such as the directed acyclic word graph representation of a collection of strings or the binary decision diagram representation of sequences of binary choices
important polynomial time computational problems on dags include topological sorting finding a topological ordering construction of the transitive closure and transitive reduction the largest and smallest dags with the same reachability relation respectively and the closure problem in which the goal is to find a minimum @-@ weight subset of vertices with no edges connecting them to the rest of the graph
transforming a directed graph with cycles into a dag by deleting as few vertices or edges as possible the feedback vertex set and feedback edge set problem respectively is np @-@ hard but any directed graph can be made into a dag its condensation by contracting each strongly connected component into a single supervertex
the problems of finding shortest paths and longest paths can be solved on dags in linear time in contrast to arbitrary graphs for which shortest path algorithms are slower and longest path problems are np @-@ hard
the corresponding concept for undirected graphs is a forest an undirected graph without cycles
choosing an orientation for a forest produces a special kind of directed acyclic graph called a polytree
however there are many other kinds of directed acyclic graph that are not formed by orienting the edges of an undirected acyclic graph
moreover every undirected graph has an acyclic orientation an assignment of a direction for its edges that makes it into a directed acyclic graph
to emphasize that dags are not the same thing as directed versions of undirected acyclic graphs some authors call them acyclic directed graphs or acyclic digraphs
in the case of a directed graph each edge has an orientation from one vertex to another vertex
a path in a directed graph can be described by a sequence of edges having the property that the ending vertex of each edge in the sequence is the same as the starting vertex of the next edge in the sequence a path forms a cycle if the starting vertex of its first edge equals the ending vertex of its last edge
a directed acyclic graph is a directed graph that has no cycles
a vertex v of a directed graph is said to be reachable from another vertex u when there exists a path that starts at u and ends at v
as a special case every vertex is considered to be reachable from itself by a path with zero edges
if a vertex can reach itself via a nontrivial path a path with one or more edges then that path is a cycle so another way to define directed acyclic graphs is that they are the graphs in which no vertex can reach itself via a nontrivial path
a topological ordering of a directed graph is an ordering of its vertices into a sequence such that for every edge the start vertex of the edge occurs earlier in the sequence than the ending vertex of the edge
a graph that has a topological ordering cannot have any cycles because the edge into the earliest vertex of a cycle would have to be oriented the wrong way
therefore every graph with a topological ordering is acyclic
conversely every directed acyclic graph has a topological ordering
therefore this property can be used as an alternative definition of the directed acyclic graphs they are exactly the graphs that have topological orderings
in this partial order two vertices u and v are ordered as u ≤ v exactly when there exists a directed path from u to v in the dag that is when v is reachable from u
however different dags may give rise to the same reachability relation and the same partial order
for example the dag with two edges a → b and b → c has the same reachability relation as the graph with three edges a → b b → c and a → c
both of these dags produce the same partial order in which the vertices are ordered as a ≤ b ≤ c
if g is a dag its transitive closure is the graph with the most edges that represents the same reachability relation
it has an edge u → v whenever u can reach v
that is it has an edge for every related pair u ≤ v of distinct elements in the reachability relation of g and may therefore be thought of as a direct translation of the reachability relation ≤ into graph @-@ theoretic terms
the same method of translating partial orders into dags works more generally for every finite partially ordered set s ≤ the graph that has a vertex for each member of s and an edge for each pair of elements related by u ≤ v is automatically a transitively closed dag and has s ≤ as its reachability relation
in this way every finite partially ordered set can be represented as the reachability relation of a dag
the transitive reduction of a dag g is the graph with the fewest edges that represents the same reachability relation as g
it is a subgraph of g formed by discarding the edges u → v for which g also contains a longer path connecting the same two vertices
like the transitive closure the transitive reduction is uniquely defined for dags
in contrast for a directed graph that is not acyclic there can be more than one minimal subgraph with the same reachability relation
if a dag g has a reachability relation described by the partial order ≤ then the transitive reduction of g is a subgraph of g that has an edge u → v for every pair in the covering relation of ≤
transitive reductions are useful in visualizing the partial orders they represent because they have fewer edges than other graphs representing the same orders and therefore lead to simpler graph drawings
a hasse diagram of a partial order is a drawing of the transitive reduction in which the orientation of each edge is shown by placing the starting vertex of the edge in a lower position than its ending vertex
the existence of such an ordering can be used to characterize dags a directed graph is a dag if and only if it has a topological ordering
in general this ordering is not unique a dag has a unique topological ordering if and only if it has a directed path containing all the vertices in which case the ordering is the same as the order in which the vertices appear in the path
the family of topological orderings of a dag is the same as the family of linear extensions of the reachability relation for the dag so any two graphs representing the same partial order have the same set of topological orders
the number of dags on n labeled vertices for n <num> <num> <num> <num> … without restrictions on the order in which these numbers appear in a topological ordering of the dag is <num> <num> <num> <num> <num> <num> <num> … sequence a003024 in the oeis
these numbers may be computed by the recurrence relation <formula> eric w
weisstein conjectured and mckay et al
<year> proved that the same numbers count the <num> @,@ <num> matrices for which all eigenvalues are positive real numbers
the proof is bijective a matrix a is an adjacency matrix of a dag if and only if a i is a <num> @,@ <num> matrix with all eigenvalues positive where i denotes the identity matrix
because a dag cannot have self @-@ loops its adjacency matrix must have a zero diagonal so adding i preserves the property that all matrix coefficients are <num> or <num>
every polytree is a dag
in particular this is true of the arborescences formed by directing all edges outwards from the roots of a tree
a multitree also called a strongly unambiguous graph or a mangrove is a directed graph in which there is at most one directed path in either direction between any two vertices equivalently it is a dag in which for every vertex v the subgraph reachable from v forms a tree
it can be solved in linear time
kahn 's algorithm for topological sorting builds the vertex ordering directly
it maintains a list of vertices that have no incoming edges from other vertices that have not already been included in the partially constructed topological ordering initially this list consists of the vertices with no incoming edges at all
then it repeatedly adds one vertex from this list to the end of the partially constructed topological ordering and checks whether its neighbors should be added to the list
the algorithm terminates when all vertices have been processed in this way
alternatively a topological ordering may be constructed by reversing a postorder numbering of a depth @-@ first search graph traversal
it is also possible to check whether a given directed graph is a dag in linear time either by attempting to find a topological ordering and then testing for each edge whether the resulting ordering is valid or alternatively for some topological sorting algorithms by verifying that the algorithm successfully orders all the vertices without meeting an error condition
the resulting orientation of the edges is called an acyclic orientation
different total orders may lead to the same acyclic orientation so an n @-@ vertex graph can have fewer than n acyclic orientations
the number of acyclic orientations is equal to χ − <num> where χ is the chromatic polynomial of the given graph
any directed graph may be made into a dag by removing a feedback vertex set or a feedback arc set a set of vertices or edges respectively that touches all cycles
however the smallest such set is np @-@ hard to find
an arbitrary directed graph may also be transformed into a dag called its condensation by contracting each of its strongly connected components into a single supervertex
when the graph is already acyclic its smallest feedback vertex sets and feedback arc sets are empty and its condensation is the graph itself
alternatively it can be solved in time o nω where ω <num>
<num> is the exponent for fast matrix multiplication algorithms this is a theoretical improvement over the o mn bound for dense graphs
in all of these transitive closure algorithms it is possible to distinguish pairs of vertices that are reachable by at least one path of length two or more from pairs that can only be connected by a length @-@ one path
the transitive reduction consists of the edges that form length @-@ one paths that are the only paths connecting their endpoints
therefore the transitive reduction can be constructed in the same asymptotic time bounds as the transitive closure
the problem may be formulated for directed graphs without the assumption of acyclicity but with no greater generality because in this case it is equivalent to the same problem on the condensation of the graph
it may be solved in polynomial time using a reduction to the maximum flow problem
for example it is possible to find shortest paths and longest paths from a given starting vertex in dags in linear time by processing the vertices in a topological order and calculating the path length for each vertex to be the minimum or maximum length obtained via any of its incoming edges
in contrast for arbitrary graphs the shortest path may require slower algorithms such as dijkstra 's algorithm or the bellman – ford algorithm and longest paths in arbitrary graphs are np @-@ hard to find
an important class of problems of this type concern collections of objects that need to be updated such as the cells of a spreadsheet after one of the cells has been changed or the object files of a piece of computer software after its source code has been changed
in this context a dependency graph is a graph that has a vertex for each object to be updated and an edge connecting two objects whenever one of them needs to be updated earlier than the other
a cycle in this graph is called a circular dependency and is generally not allowed because there would be no way to consistently schedule the tasks involved in the cycle
dependency graphs without circular dependencies form dags
for instance when one cell of a spreadsheet changes it is necessary to recalculate the values of other cells that depend directly or indirectly on the changed cell
for this problem the tasks to be scheduled are the recalculations of the values of individual cells of the spreadsheet
dependencies arise when an expression in one cell uses a value from another cell
in such a case the value that is used must be recalculated earlier than the expression that uses it
topologically ordering the dependency graph and using this topological order to schedule the cell updates allows the whole spreadsheet to be updated with only a single evaluation per cell
similar problems of task ordering arise in makefiles for program compilation and instruction scheduling for low @-@ level computer program optimization
a somewhat different dag @-@ based formulation of scheduling constraints is used by the program evaluation and review technique pert a method for management of large human projects that was one of the first applications of dags
in this method the vertices of a dag represent milestones of a project rather than specific tasks to be performed
instead a task or activity is represented by an edge of a dag connecting two milestones that mark the beginning and completion of the task
each such edge is labeled with an estimate for the amount of time that it will take a team of workers to perform the task
the longest path in this dag represents the critical path of the project the one that controls the total time for the project
individual milestones can be scheduled according to the lengths of the longest paths ending at their vertices
in this representation data enters a processing element through its incoming edges and leaves the element through its outgoing edges
for instance in electronic circuit design static combinational logic blocks can be represented as an acyclic system of logic gates that computes a function of an input where the input and output of the function are represented as individual bits
in general the output of these blocks cannot be used as the input unless it is captured by a register or state element which maintains its acyclic properties
electronic circuit schematics either on paper or in a database are a form of directed acyclic graphs using instances or components to form a directed reference to a lower level component
electronic circuits themselves are not necessarily acyclic or directed
dataflow programming languages describe systems of operations on data streams and the connections between the outputs of some operations and the inputs of others
these languages can be convenient for describing repetitive data processing tasks in which the same acyclically @-@ connected collection of operations is applied to many data items
they can be executed as a parallel algorithm in which each operation is performed by a parallel process as soon as another set of inputs becomes available to it
in compilers straight line code that is sequences of statements without loops or conditional branches may be represented by a dag describing the inputs and outputs of each of the arithmetic operations performed within the code
this representation allows the compiler to perform common subexpression elimination efficiently
for instance a bayesian network represents a system of probabilistic events as vertices in a directed acyclic graph in which the likelihood of an event may be calculated from the likelihoods of its predecessors in the dag
in this context the moral graph of a dag is the undirected graph created by adding an undirected edge between all parents of the same vertex sometimes called marrying and then replacing all directed edges by undirected edges
another type of graph with a similar causal structure is an influence diagram the vertices of which represent either decisions to be made or unknown information and the edges of which represent causal influences from one vertex to another
in epidemiology for instance these diagrams are often used to estimate the expected value of different choices for intervention
despite the name these graphs are not necessarily trees because of the possibility of marriages between relatives so a child has a common ancestor on both the mother 's and father 's side causing pedigree collapse
the graphs of matrilineal descent mother relationships between women and patrilineal descent father relationships between men are trees within this graph
because no one can become their own ancestor family trees are acyclic
for the same reason the version history of a distributed revision control system generally has the structure of a directed acyclic graph in which there is a vertex for each revision and an edge connecting pairs of revisions that were directly derived from each other
these are not trees in general due to merges
in many randomized algorithms in computational geometry the algorithm maintains a history dag representing the version history of a geometric structure over the course of a sequence of changes to the structure
for instance in a randomized incremental algorithm for delaunay triangulation the triangulation changes by replacing one triangle by three smaller triangles when each point is added and by flip operations that replace pairs of triangles by a different pair of triangles
the history dag for this algorithm has a vertex for each triangle constructed as part of the algorithm and edges from each triangle to the two or three other triangles that replace it
this structure allows point location queries to be answered efficiently to find the location of a query point q in the delaunay triangulation follow a path in the history dag at each step moving to the replacement triangle that contains q
the final triangle reached in this path must be the delaunay triangle that contains q
in this type of application one finds a dag in which the paths form the given sequences
when many of the sequences share the same subsequences these shared subsequences can be represented by a shared part of the dag allowing the representation to use less space than it would take to list out all of the sequences separately
for example the directed acyclic word graph is a data structure in computer science formed by a directed acyclic graph with a single source and with edges labeled by letters or symbols the paths from the source to the sinks in this graph represent a set of strings such as english words
any set of sequences can be represented as paths in a tree by forming a tree vertex for every prefix of a sequence and making the parent of one of these vertices represent the sequence with one fewer element the tree formed in this way for a set of strings is called a trie
a directed acyclic word graph saves space over a trie by allowing paths to diverge and rejoin so that a set of words with the same possible suffixes can be represented by a single tree vertex
the same idea of using a dag to represent a family of paths occurs in the binary decision diagram a dag @-@ based data structure for representing binary functions
in a binary decision diagram each non @-@ sink vertex is labeled by the name of a binary variable and each sink and each edge is labeled by a <num> or <num>
the function value for any truth assignment to the variables is the value at the sink found by following a path starting from the single source vertex that at each non @-@ sink vertex follows the outgoing edge labeled with the value of that vertex 's variable
just as directed acyclic word graphs can be viewed as a compressed form of tries binary decision diagrams can be viewed as compressed forms of decision trees that save space by allowing paths to rejoin when they agree on the results of all remaining decisions
the episode was co @-@ written by j

wyman and jeff pinkner and directed by dennis smith
the episode marked the first prominent appearance of more than one observer and follows the events that occur when one of them saves a girl from boarding a soon @-@ to @-@ be crashing plane
it featured two new guest stars peter woodward and eugene lipinski
the episode first aired on november <num> <year> in the united states to mostly positive reviews with many critics praising the new revelations about the observers
an estimated <num>
<num> million viewers watched the episode on its first broadcast
olivia dunham anna torv and peter bishop joshua jackson learn of the events and realize the assailant matches the description of the observer
however after viewing video footage they find that it is not september michael cerveris the observer known for observing pattern @-@ related cases and who previously saved peter and his father walter john noble in <year> indicating there is more than one observer
olivia is confused as to august 's motives as observers are known to only observe events and not interfere with them
after questioning christine 's roommate olivia learns she was to take a flight to rome italy
peter finds a picture of christine from her childhood before her parents were killed in the <year> san francisco earthquake and sees august in the background indicating he has been observing her entire life
the plane to rome would later crash killing everyone on board
because of this the team realize august in fact saved her life
at massive dynamic brandon ryan mcdonald theorizes to the team that observers are time travelers as they have been documented during several major events in history
they write in an incomprehensible language and the number of observer sightings has increased over the past few months leaving the team wondering why
meanwhile august visits the other observers who are not happy that he saved a girl who was supposed to die in the plane crash
to correct his mistake they send donald long paul rae an assassin affiliated with the observers to correct august 's actions
in an attempt to save christine august sends a secret message to walter
during the meeting august reveals christine will die because she is not important walter tells august that he has to make her important
the team are later made aware of christine 's location at a motel outside the city
however donald is on the trail also
august attempts to stop him but donald shoots him several times before peter and olivia arrive to kill the assassin
september picks up august and while driving september asks august why he saved christine
august reveals that he is experiencing feelings and that he loves christine and asks if she would be safe
september informs him christine will stay alive because she is now important she was responsible for the death of an observer
august cries before succumbing to his wounds
in the end olivia takes a day off to spend time with her niece ella at an amusement park
two observers watch the two and they remark that everything is about to get so hard for olivia

wyman and jeff pinkner while being directed by ncis veteran dennis smith
they began shooting the episode during the second half of september <year> right after wrapping production on of human action
supervising producer josh singer later noted how august helped them write the rest of the season there was one episode august which was all about the observers that i feel was mythology without being mythology
and somehow in working that episode we sort of found a new creative vein
and it 's not that that episode was necessarily so related to everything else we did
but i feel like it sort of opened us up in terms of how we were feeling about the year
up to the point the episode august aired only one character that was part of a group known as observers had been introduced
in this episode two more such individuals were revealed august played by peter woodward and december played by eugene lipinski
the creation of observers was one of the first ideas the writers of fringe thought of when developing the show in its early stages when they asked each other what if there were these characters where all they did was watch
pinkner and wyman thought of creating observers by looking for something
iconic that had the quality of being invisible
though the observer called september has appeared in every single fringe episode in a brief cameo he was first featured prominently in the fourth episode of the first season
the producers thought of unique characteristics for somebody who wasn 't of our world evolving to the observers having bald heads no eyebrows and largely deadened senses which led to a love for extremely hot peppers
before the second season premiere aired in september <year> co @-@ creator j
r
orci hinted that the audience was going to meet many observers and that in the season 's eighth episode you 're going to find out their role in the world what they 're named after and their connection to some of these characters
later on when still leading up to the airing of august in another interview roberto orci elaborated that individuality will be one of the things that they will be fanatically struggling with actually
that was a fun one because that one was one where you 're finally getting to pay off things you 've been setting up for a year
you finally get to open the toy box and really play with those toys
actor michael cerveris who plays september commented in an interview that as a result of the episode viewers would learn that the observers are not completely devoid of feelings and are not incapable of being attached to people they 're observing
he also expressed relief that his character was no longer the sole observer on the show joking that it was nice to feel like i 'm not the only freak in town for once
actress anna torv stated in an interview with mtv news that august was one of her favorite episodes because we sort of get to meet the observers
at the moment what we know about them they
seemingly just observe
that 's kind of it but in the episode that we have coming up we 're not sure if all they do is just observe
<num> million viewers in the united states with a <num>
<num> rating
the episode was down <num> from the previous week 's episode of human action which had a rating of <num>
<num>
ramsey isler of ign gave the episode <num>
<num> <num> writing that despite the hype the episode was just plain average
he did however appreciate the new revelations about the observers
after previewing the episode entertainment weekly 's ken tucker graded the episode an a- explaining fringe had become one of the fastest smartest wittiest shows on television now
andrew hanson from the los angeles times called it a good story peppered with a lot of great details
august showed a greater connection to the larger fringe universe
noel murray of the a
v
club graded it with a b praising the wonderfully moody episode and how it was able to make the halting observer dialogue work
murray found some aspects lacking however as he thought it was a very sketchy episode plot @-@ wise and mythology @-@ wise
not a whole lot happened
website blogger io9 listed august as one of the crucial episodes new viewers must watch to get into the show
the film was written by kazunori itō directed by mamoru oshii animated by production i

the music composed by kenji kawai included an ancient japanese language in a wedding song that serves as a key piece of music leading up to the climax of the movie
widely considered one of the greatest anime films of all time critics particularly praised its visuals which at the time were the most effective synthesis of traditional cel animation and cg animation
it has served as inspiration for filmmakers such as the wachowskis

kusanagi and her team arrest him and the man who gave him the program but discover that their memories were either erased or implanted ghost @-@ hacked by the puppet master
a facility is hacked and programmed to assemble a female cybernetic body
the body escapes but is hit by a truck section <num> investigates and examines the body which seems to have a human ghost inside — perhaps the puppet master himself
officials from rival agency section <num> visit section <num> and explain that the body was made to lure the puppet master 's ghost and trap it inside
kusanagi espies the conversation and decides to disconnect her consciousness from her current body and connect or dive into the body and face the puppet master 's ghost
before she succeeds the ghost activates the body
section <num> storms section <num> and reclaims the body
the information from the body leads section <num> to uncover the mysterious project <num>
section <num> claims the project was created to catch the hacker but it was initiated before his appearance
section <num> speculates that the project itself created the puppet master who then escaped and section <num> now wants him back
daisuke aramaki head of section <num> suspects that the project and the puppet master are tools of the ministry of foreign affairs
the escape might lead to the release of secrets that could embarrass section <num> and the ministry
the getaway car carrying the puppet master meets another and they split off
batou stops the first car and realizes it is a decoy

i am also interested in computers through my own personal experience with them
i had the same feeling about patlabor and i thought it would be interesting to make a film that took place in the near future
there are only a few movies even out of hollywood which clearly portray the influence and power of computers
i thought this theme would be more effectively conveyed through animation
oshii expanded on these thoughts in a later interview noting that technology changes people and had become a part of the culture of japan
he commented that his use of philosophy caused producers to become frustrated because of sparing use of action scenes
oshii also acknowledged that a movie with more action would sell better but he continued to make these movies anyway
when oshii went back to make changes to the original ghost in the shell to re @-@ release it as ghost in the shell <num>
<num> one of the reasons he gave was that the film did not resemble the sequel
he wanted to update the film to reflect changes in perspective
okiura chose to depict a physically mature person to match motoko 's mental age instead of the youthful twenty @-@ something appearance in the manga
motoko 's demeanor lacks the comedic facial expressions and rebellious nature depicted in the manga
oshii based the setting for ghost in the shell on hong kong
oshii commented that his first thought to find an image of the future setting was an asian city but finding a suitable cityscape of the future would be impossible
oshii chose to use the real streets of hong kong as his model
he also said that hong kong was the perfect subject and theme for the film with its countless signs and the cacophony of sounds
the film 's mecha designer takeuchi atsushi noted that while the film does not have a chosen setting it is obviously based on hong kong because the city represented the theme of the film the old and the new which exist in a strange relationship in an age of an information deluge
before shooting the film the artists drew sketches that emphasized hong kong 's chaotic confusing and overwhelming aspects
the hong kong setting is alluded to by the scene wherein the characters are drinking san miguel beer a cultural staple of the east asian megalopolis
in <year> dga was thought to be the future of animation which mixed traditional animation with the emerging use of computer graphics including digital cel work with visual displays
editing was performed on an avid system of avid technology which was chosen because it was more versatile and less limiting than other methods and worked with the different types of media in a single environment
the digital cel work included both original illustrations compositions and manipulation with traditional cel animation to create a sense of depth and evoke emotion and feelings
utilized as background filters like a lens effect were used to create a sense of depth and motion by distorting the front background and making the far background out of focus throughout the shot
ghost in the shell used a unique lighting system in which light and darkness were integrated into the cels with attention to light and shadow sources instead of using contrast to control the light
hiromasa ogura the art director described this as a very unusual lighting technique
some special effects like motoko 's thermo @-@ optical camouflage were rendered through the use of tima software
the process uses a single illustration and manipulates the image as necessary to produce distortions for effect in combination with a background without altering the original illustration
the effect is re @-@ added back into the shot to complete the scene
while the visual displays used in the film were technically simple to create the appearance of the displays underwent numerous revisions by the production team to best represent visual displays of the future
another aspect of the cg use was to create images and effects that looked as if they were perceived by the brain and were generated in video and added to the film in its final stages
the opening credits of the film were produced by the cg director seichi tanaka
tanaka converted code in a computer language displayed in romanized japanese letters to numbers before inserting them into the computer to generate the credits
the origin of this code is the names of the film 's staff as written in a computer language
animation director toshihiko nishikubo was responsible for the realism and strove for accurate depictions of movement and effects
the pursuit of realism included the staff conducting firearms research at a facility in guam
nishikubo has highlighted the tank scene as an example of the movie 's realism noting that bullets create sparks when hitting metal but do not spark when a bullet strikes stone
a spatializer was used to alter the sound specifically in the electronic brain conversations to modify the voices
composer kenji kawai scored the film
for the main theme kawai tried to imagine the setting and convey the essence of that world in the music
he used the ancient japanese language of yamato in the opening theme making of a cyborg
the composition is a mixture of bulgarian harmony and traditional japanese notes the haunting chorals are a wedding song sung to dispel all evil influences
symphony conductor sarah penicka @-@ smith notes that the song 's lyrics are fitting for the union between kusanagi and project <num> at the climax of the movie
kawai originally wanted to use bulgarian folk music singers but used japanese folk singers instead

the website 's critical consensus reads a stunning feat of modern animation ghost in the shell offers a thoughtful complex treat for anime fans as well as a perfect introduction for viewers new to the genre
niels matthijs of twitch film praised the film stating not only is kokaku kidotai an essential film in the canon of japanese animation together with kubrick 's <year> and tarkovsky 's solyaris it completes a trio of book adaptations that transcend the popularity of their originals and give a new meaning to an already popular brand
he ranked it <num> of his personal favorites
clark collis of empire opined that the film was predictable but praised its production values
johnathan mays of anime news network praised the animation combined with the computer effects calling it perhaps the best synthesis ever witnessed in anime
helen mccarthy in <num> essential anime movies describes the film as one of the best anime ever made praising screenplay an atmospheric score and adding that action scenes as good as anything in the current hollywood blockbuster are supported by cgi effects that can still astonish

sharalyn orbaugh has noted that the opening scene of ghost in the shell begins with the perfect paradoxical introduction to a narrative that is all about the nature of sex gender identity and self @-@ identity in general in a future world where sexual reproduction has given way to mechanical replication
motoko 's female identity and appearance are countered by an autonomous subjectivity resulting in a male cyborg body which cannot menstruate
orbaugh describes the juxtaposition of the opening scene depicting the creation of motoko 's body and to her lack of menstruation as setting the theme of reproductive sexuality in a posthuman subject
the film depicts motoko 's identity and ontological concerns ending with the evolution of a being with full subjectivity through a new form of reproduction with the puppet master
austin corbett commented on the lack of sexualization from her team as freedom from femininity noting that motoko is overtly feminine and clearly non @-@ female
carl slivio has called ghost in the shell a resistant film due to its inversion of traditional gender roles its valorization of the post @-@ gendered subject and its de @-@ emphasis of the sexual specificity of the material body
the wachowskis creators of the matrix and its sequels showed it to producer joel silver saying we wanna do that for real
the matrix series took several concepts from the film including the matrix digital rain which was inspired by the opening credits of ghost in the shell and the way people accessed the matrix through holes in the back of their necks
other parallels have been drawn to james cameron 's avatar steven spielberg 's ai artificial intelligence and jonathan mostow 's surrogates
originally yo @-@ yo was set to be roberts debut single but beat of my drum was selected in its place
beat of my drum and lucky day roberts previous singles garnered positive comments from critics but failed to impact commercially
yo @-@ yo was written by roberts maya von doll and dimitri tikovoi while it was produced by latter and was the first song to be composed by the group
roberts also claimed the track had defined her musical style
yo @-@ yo is a <num> @-@ themed electropop and synthpop song in which roberts sings about an undecided lover
the song received positive reviews from critics who compared roberts vocals to those of singer kate bush
commercially it was a failure charting at number <num> on the uk singles chart
a music video was released on <num> november <year> the video sees roberts repeatedly changing outfit for a party in which she finds her love interest cheating on her ending with an aggressive confrontation
it garnered positive critical responses although the low @-@ budget drew criticism
roberts performed yo @-@ yo at london 's g @-@ a @-@ y nightclub and on the alan titchmarsh show among other occasions
a busy schedule and constant media criticism found her describing the time as a blur
her exhaustion and troubles with negative media comments led to a state in which she had to harden herself claiming that inside she was dying
these events inspired her debut album cinderella 's eyes
yo @-@ yo was the first song she had written with maya von doll and dimitri tikovoi for the album
the recording was also one of the first songs roberts wrote and it helped define her musical style
roberts blogged about the production of the track writing that the production ’ s incredible
the beat is just so constant and powerful
that was the first song that i wrote with dimitri and maya
i felt like i ’ d found my sound
and i was kind of looking at it like an outfit
so it was ‘ if this was an outfit what would this song need now ’ so we had the pretty dress which was the chorus
we had the lovely shoes which was the verse
‘ but what do we need to really set this song off a big fancy bow in the hair would really set this song off
’ so when i got to the middle eight i wanted to go really erratic almost like tatu on all the things she said
i wanted it to be proper fucked up and crazy – hands in the air
she released a follow @-@ up single lucky day which likewise garnered positive responses but was even less successful commercially charting at number <num> on both the scottish and uk singles charts
writing as a guest blogger on the website holy moly in september <year> roberts announced that yo @-@ yo would be released as the third single from cinderella 's eyes initially citing a november release date the release was later delayed until january <year>
roberts had originally intended for yo @-@ yo to be the first single from the album but beat of my drum was instead chosen at the last minute
roberts stated that it felt right to go with the latter song
yo @-@ yo was released digitally on <num> january <year> with roberts announcing on her official website that the single would be released in cd format featuring a live performance of the song in addition to the demo version of her song sticks stones seven days later
additionally two eps were released on <num> january <year>
however the <num> concept goes completely out of the window for an unhinged bridge which features a club mix which speeds up the drums featured in the song
the lyrics of the track discuss an uncertain relationship leading to vulnerability with roberts describing it as a dark song
the song references a yo @-@ yo this is a metaphor for roberts herself a spinning yo @-@ yo on the finger of a hot n cold lover
described as confessional by robert copsey of digital spy the song has a conversational performance and roberts vocals were compared to that of singer kate bush
the song received positive reviews from music critics
emily mackay writing for nme described the chorus as a winning one and noted that the impulse @-@ speed space synths are broken @-@ heartedly beguiling
in a separate review lisa wright from nme found that while the song didn 't match the success of beat of my drum
wright said that the song is not a cuss @-@ ridden introduction to nicola ’ s re @-@ emergence as an english syd tha kyd but a questionable metaphor about being like a crap ’ <num> toy
robert copsey of digital spy found cinderella 's eyes to be frustratingly under @-@ appreciated with yo @-@ yo being a shining example of roberts pop sensibilities calling it unashamedly radio friendly
then rapid shots show her in various other outfits including a purple velvet dress all the time showing the man performing tricks with the yo @-@ yo
as the chorus begins roberts is shown in the kitchen of the house along with several women dancing with her
another shot shows a man and a woman walking through a street embracing each other
this is later interspersed with shots of a fully clothed roberts standing in a shower cubiclem getting increasingly wet
roberts is shown leaving the house and seeing the man with whom she had danced with another woman
she returns to the house and the man and roberts are seen in the kitchen area with roberts throwing a series of objects at him
these showed her in what was described as some sort of untidy yet fashionable looking house while one showed her with her legs above her head wearing kandee 's caramel kisses shoes and a third and final seeing her cosying up next to a handsome chap
the same day roberts gave two more exclusive stills to website digital spy in one image she was smelling roses while in the second she was playing with a pair of shoes
the video was released on <num> november <year>
after the official release nadia mendoza of the daily mail stated the video was a departure from her previous two videos for beat of my drum and lucky day saying that it looks and sounds a lot more grown up as she teases viewers by stripping to her bra and frolicking in the shower
mendoza found that roberts was becoming quite the chameleon and had trampled all over her innocent charm to create a sex siren referencing her transformation throughout her videos
katherine st asaph of pop dust found that the video 's low budget had had a negative effect
she pre @-@ recorded a performance of yo @-@ yo for uk television programme the alan titchmarsh show during the same taping as a performance of lucky day
the taping came after deciding yo @-@ yo would be released as the third single from the album with roberts saying i absolutely love performing yo @-@ yo it 's my favourite one to do
so i feel really close to yo @-@ yo
i feel like i lose myself when i 'm performing it
after the release of the single roberts performed on the album chart show during a special dedicated to her performing three tracks yo @-@ yo beat of my drum and sticks stones
roberts also performed the song on british chat show loose women and on the digital music awards

he scored his first league hat @-@ trick against southampton in only his fifth league game
his very first league goal for the reds had come on <num> october <year> when an <num> @-@ minute equaliser at home to struggling oldham athletic saved the reds from what would have been one of the biggest premier league shocks of the season with a last gasp own goal giving liverpool a <num> – <num> win
he scored twice in a thrilling <num> – <num> draw at tottenham hotspur on <num> december
his first <num> games for the club yielded <num> goals and he was rewarded with an england under @-@ <num> debut against san marino in november <year> in which he scored england 's opening goal in the third minute
fowler was unable to sustain his goal @-@ a @-@ game ratio throughout the season but finished his first season as the club 's leading scorer with <num> goals in all competitions although ian rush had scored more goals in the league
it was however a disappointing season for liverpool as they finished eighth in the premier league without making any impact in any of the major competitions though the departure of graeme souness as manager and the appointment of roy evans as successor built up hope for the future
his record stood for twenty years until broken by sadio mané on <num> may <year> for southampton against aston villa who scored three goals in two minutes and <num> seconds
fowler also scored braces against aston villa ipswich town chelsea and norwich city in the league that season
fowler was voted the pfa young player of the year in two consecutive years in <year> and <year> a feat equalled only by ryan giggs and wayne rooney
throughout the mid and late <num> fowler was widely considered to be the most natural finisher playing in england
fowler sealed this reputation as he scored more than <num> goals for three consecutive seasons up to <year>
he remains the only player to have scored <num> plus goals in his first three full seasons in england scoring <num> goals with a total of <num> in <num> and a half years something which has also yet to be beaten in la liga seria a and the bundesliga too
fowler 's partnership with steve mcmanaman was largely described as the reason why liverpool had become the club known for being the most potent attacking force in england at the time and fowler was renowned for scoring goals of all varieties from every angle and distance with mcmanaman describing him as the greatest goalscorer of all time
stan collymore fowler 's strike partner from <year> to <year> said in his autobiography that fowler was the best player he has ever played alongside
fowler and collymore were among the most prolific goal @-@ scoring strike partnerships in england during the <year> – <num> season
in the same season he scored twice in a <num> – <num> victory over newcastle united a match voted the best of the decade in a premier league poll
the match helped prevent newcastle from winning the league but it was not enough for liverpool to clinch the title they finished third while manchester united were crowned champions
fowler also played in his first fa cup final that season but was on the losing side as manchester united won <num> – <num>
fowler received a call @-@ up to the full england squad and won his first cap on <num> march <year> as a substitute in a friendly against bulgaria
his first start at international level was against croatia which was the england game following his substitute appearance
fowler was part of the england squad for euro <year> making two appearances in the tournament
on <num> december <year> he scored four against middlesbrough including his hundredth for liverpool
this meant he reached a century of goals one game quicker than his first strike partner ian rush in just <num> games
that year he also won a uefa fair play award for denying that he had been fouled by arsenal goalkeeper david seaman at highbury after a penalty had been given
after unsuccessfully trying to persuade the referee to change his decision about the penalty fowler took it tamely and seaman saved
however seaman failed to hold on to the ball and jason mcateer scored from the rebound
though many people believe that he deliberately took the penalty kick poorly for reasons of fair play fowler said at the time as a goalscorer it 's part of my job to take it and i wanted to score it
i tried to score
i never missed on purpose
it just happened it was a bad penalty
the term was coined by the daily mail and arose due to misplaced rumours that fowler was dating spice girl emma bunton
the term was subsequently used in a derogatory manner implying fowler and colleagues such as jamie redknapp stan collymore david james and steve mcmanaman were underachieving playboys
fowler 's performance in the <year> – <num> football season was marred by a knee ligament injury that kept him out of action for half the season and caused him to miss the <year> world cup
during this period of injury fellow liverpool striker michael owen rose to prominence making his debut in <year>
owen established himself in the liverpool team in fowler 's absence
in <year> fowler was fined £ <num> @,@ <num> by his club for bringing the game into disrepute
while celebrating his goal against liverpool 's merseyside rivals everton fowler used the white line of the penalty area to simulate cocaine use
liverpool manager gérard houllier stated that this was a cameroonian grass @-@ eating celebration learnt from teammate rigobert song
defending himself fowler later said this was a response to everton fans who had insulted him with false accusations of drug abuse
fowler received a four @-@ match suspension from the fa for this incident
at the same fa disciplinary hearing fowler received a further two match suspension due to a separate incident in which he had taunted the chelsea defender graeme le saux by waving his backside at him as le saux 's wife and children watched from the stands
fowler later attempted to justify his actions by suggesting his taunts were simply an extension of gamesmanship
the fa imposed a £ <num> @,@ <num> fine and a six @-@ match ban for the two incidents
fowler has since apologized to le saux for the incident
he appeared in three finals scoring <num> goals and lifting three trophies in a unique cup treble
in the absence of jamie redknapp who was sidelined by injury fowler was named as liverpool captain when he started
however he found himself the third @-@ choice liverpool striker with houllier favouring a forward partnership of michael owen and emile heskey
he took part in a fourth round league cup hammering of stoke city scoring a hat @-@ trick in an <num> – <num> victory which was second only to the club 's biggest ever win in <year> – a <num> – <num> defeat of fulham
in the league cup final against birmingham city the club 's first cup final since <year> he captained the side and scored in the <num> minute
liverpool went on to win the trophy on penalties with fowler scoring liverpool 's fifth in the shootout
fowler picked up the alan hardaker man of the match award and lifted the trophy
fowler 's season picked up from there as he scored several important goals including one against runaway champions manchester united and a free kick in the fa cup semi @-@ final against wycombe wanderers
fowler featured as a substitute in the <year> fa cup final coming on as a <num> @-@ minute replacement for vladimír šmicer
liverpool who were <num> – <num> down at that point eventually won the game <num> – <num> with two goals from owen
fowler raised the trophy along with sami hyypiä and jamie redknapp
four days later he was a substitute again in liverpool 's third final the <year> uefa cup final against deportivo alavés
he came on in the <num> minute for heskey with the score at <num> – <num>
he scored seven minutes later but alavés equalised before full @-@ time and liverpool eventually won with a golden goal an own goal in the <num> minute
fowler and hyypiä then raised liverpool 's third trophy of the season together
liverpool 's next and final game of the season was against charlton athletic and fowler scored twice in a <num> – <num> victory at the valley that assured them uefa champions league qualification for the next season
he made an appearance in liverpool 's <num> – <num> european super cup victory over bayern munich but starts were intermittent
in october <year> he scored his first league hat @-@ trick for three years helping liverpool beat leicester city <num> – <num> but was dropped for the following league match
though fowler had been on a contract extension from <year> unlike steve mcmanaman – who exercised his bosman entitlement the very same year fowler was linked to lazio arsenal and leeds and liverpool 's management as well as fans and the media constantly reported that what happened with mcmanaman regarded as a huge financial loss would never be repeated and thus the club never rejected those bids without consideration
this meant that coupled with fowler 's relationship with houllier speculation over fowler 's future persisted for most of houllier 's tenure and became an issue that divided liverpool fans
his last appearance for liverpool was against sunderland in which he was substituted at half @-@ time
this along with his difficult relationship with houllier made him seek regular first team football away from anfield in the form of a £ <num> million move to leeds united
fowler maintains that houllier forced him out of liverpool and accused houllier of pressuring the liverpool echo newspaper to use its influence to turn opinion against him
the transfer went ahead just one month after his hat @-@ trick at leicester
he made his leeds debut in an away game against fulham in december <year> the same ground where he had made his liverpool debut eight years earlier
fowler scored <num> goals in the remainder of the season helping leeds to a uefa cup qualifying place
fowler was included in the england squad for the <year> world cup but only made one appearance coming on as substitute in a second round win over denmark
fowler suffered an aggravation of a pre @-@ existing hip injury in the <year> – <num> pre @-@ season and did not recover until december
struggling to gain fitness and seeing team @-@ mates sold off due to a financial crisis fowler 's form and market value diminished
it was despite this decrease in form that he still in total scored <num> goals in <num> appearances for leeds achieving an impressive strike rate of just less than one goal every two games
in <year> – <num> leeds finished <num> in the premier league and a severe financial crisis was developing
fowler initially turned down the move and a dispute between manchester city manager kevin keegan and chairman david bernstein over whether the transfer should take place due to medical concerns resulted in bernstein leaving the club
following encouragement from keegan fowler finally signed for manchester city on <num> january <year> for an initial fee of £ <num> million and a further £ <num> million dependent upon appearances
bizarre transfer conditions meant leeds united still paid a significant proportion of fowler 's wages
fowler made his manchester city debut against west bromwich albion on <num> february <year> but made a poor start to his manchester city career scoring just two goals in the remainder of the season
fowler continued to struggle with fitness problems in the <year> – <num> season completing the full <num> minutes only nine times however he did score against his old club liverpool in a <num> – <num> draw at home
the arrival of close friend steve mcmanaman from real madrid gave fowler hope but the pair failed to rekindle their prolific partnership from their time at liverpool and received criticism from the fans and tabloids for their salaries alleged excesses as well as named and shamed in a sex scandal covered by the news of the world that year
despite the slump fowler rallied for the following campaign and showed a marked improvement in the second half of the <year> – <num> season scoring his <num> premiership goal in the <num> – <num> win over norwich city on <num> february <year>
however his failure to convert a <num> @-@ minute penalty kick against middlesbrough 's mark schwarzer in the final game of the season prevented manchester city from gaining a place in the uefa cup
despite this fowler ended the season as the club 's joint top goal scorer and gained the approval of the fans finishing in the top three in the fans player of the year poll
fowler later described this as one of the proudest achievements of my career
fowler had injury problems at the start of the <year> – <num> season and rarely featured when fit making just two substitute appearances in the first four months of the season
his first start of the season came against scunthorpe united in the fa cup on <num> january <year> in which he scored a hat @-@ trick
the following week he scored manchester city 's third goal in their <num> – <num> win against local rivals manchester united after coming on as substitute
however fowler made only one more appearance for manchester city before returning to liverpool on a free transfer
fowler had remained a liverpool fan after he left the club he was in the istanbul crowd when liverpool won the champions league in <year>
the fans were overjoyed to learn that fowler had returned there were large banners in the game against birmingham city which read god – number eleven welcome back to heaven with god being fowler 's nickname while he was previously at liverpool
fowler 's return against birmingham city in february <year> was labelled by the tabloid press as the stuff of fairytales and he himself said he felt like a kid waking up on christmas morning every day
fowler 's first appearance back at anfield was as a substitute against birmingham receiving a standing ovation upon his introduction
after his return he had three goals ruled out for offside before finally getting off the mark on <num> march <year> in a home game against fulham the same opponents against which he scored his first ever goal for liverpool <num> years earlier
fowler 's next liverpool goal against west bromwich albion meant he overtook kenny dalglish in the club 's all @-@ time top scorers
his resurgence continued as he marked his 31st birthday with a goal against bolton wanderers
he made it four goals in five games when he scored the only goal in a <num> – <num> victory over blackburn rovers on <num> april <year>
however fowler 's fitness remained a concern
in march <year> manager rafael benítez commented on fowler 's work and progress by saying to buy a robbie fowler who is fit and scoring goals would cost a lot maybe £ <num> or more
despite concerns about his fitness fowler finished the <year> – <num> season scoring on a more consistent basis than liverpool 's other strikers
in may <year> he was offered a new one @-@ year contract with the club and celebrated by scoring the first goal in liverpool 's last league game of the season in a <num> – <num> away win at portsmouth
it was his final game of the season as he was unable to take part in the club 's fa cup final success due to being cup @-@ tied
fowler featured rarely in his final liverpool season making only six league starts
bizarrely all three of his league goals were penalties against sheffield united
one of these was in the away game on the opening day of the season and the other two in the reverse fixture at anfield
appearances in other competitions were more common due to rafael benítez 's squad rotation policy
on <num> october <year> fowler was named as liverpool 's captain for the first time since his return in a league cup tie against reading scoring just before half @-@ time in a <num> – <num> win

this led to a fourth round tie against fowler 's former club liverpool at anfield to which even the liverpool faithful crowd urged fowler to score seeing that it may be the last time he would play in anfield but cardiff were knocked out in a <num> – <num> defeat
in november fowler travelled to frankfurt germany to see dr
hans @-@ wilhelm müller @-@ wohlfahrt a specialist sports injuries doctor to try and resolve a recurring hip problem that had left him lacking fitness in early season fixtures for the bluebirds
the treatment involved taking around twenty @-@ eight injections into his hip
he returned to full training in late november and made his comeback on <num> december as a late substitute in a <num> – <num> defeat against bristol city
however he went on to suffer another injury blow just days later after a mistimed tackle in training from club captain darren purse left him with damaged ankle ligaments
due to the new injury blow cardiff and fowler made plans for him to go to colorado united states to undergo keyhole surgery on the hip problem which had plagued him in recent seasons in the hope that it would finally resolve the problem
on <num> january <year> it was announced that fowler could miss the rest of the <year> – <num> season for cardiff after his hip operation revealed that the injury was worse than previously thought

after training with blackburn and appearing in a handful of friendlies he was offered a six @-@ month deal by the club to last until january but fowler turned down the deal due to it being a shorter offer than the previous one he had rejected at cardiff
after turning down the offer fowler made a shock enquiry about returning to cardiff on the deal he had originally turned down prompting anger from supporters and a swift no thanks from the club

his three @-@ month deal at blackburn expired on <num> december <year> and after not being offered a new contract was released by the club he entered talks with new australian a @-@ league club north queensland fury
it was an important signing for the new franchise who struggled to sign a marquee player while some questioned whether fowler would be able to cope with the heat and humidity of north queensland
fowler made his debut in july <year> in a <num> – <num> pre @-@ season loss against wolverhampton wanderers in perth after recovering from groin and hip complaints

fowler is a cousin of boxer and <year> commonwealth games gold medallist antony fowler
the others were ode on a grecian urn ode on melancholy ode to a nightingale and ode to psyche
the poem describes the state of indolence otherwise known as laziness and was written during a time when he felt that he should devote his efforts to earning an income instead of composing poetry
after finishing the spring poems keats wrote in june <year> that its composition brought him more pleasure than anything else he had written that year
unlike the other odes he wrote that year ode on indolence was not published until <year> <num> years after his death
the poem is an example of keats 's break from the structure of the classical form
it follows the poet 's contemplation of a morning spent in idleness
three figures are presented — ambition love and poesy — dressed in placid sandals and white robes
the narrator examines each using a series of questions and statements on life and art
the poem concludes with the narrator giving up on having all three of the figures as part of his life
some critics regard ode on indolence as inferior to the other four <year> odes
others suggest that the poem exemplifies a continuity of themes and imagery characteristic of his more widely read works and provides valuable biographical insight into his poetic career
on <num> may <year> he abandoned this plan after receiving a request for financial assistance from his brother george
unable to help keats was torn by guilt and despair and sought projects more lucrative than poetry
it was under these circumstances that he wrote ode on indolence
in a letter to his brother dated <num> march <year> keats discussed indolence as a subject
he may have written the ode as early as march but the themes and stanza forms suggest may or june <year> when it is known he was working on ode on a grecian urn ode on melancholy ode to a nightingale and ode to psyche
during this period keats 's friend charles armitage brown transcribed copies of the spring odes and submitted them to publisher richard woodhouse
keats wrote to his friend sarah jeffrey t he thing i have most enjoyed this year has been writing an ode to indolence
despite this enjoyment however he was not entirely satisfied with ode on indolence and it remained unpublished until <year>
keats 's notes and papers do not reveal the precise dating of the <year> odes
literary scholars have proposed several different orders of composition arguing that the poems form a sequence within their structures
in the consecrated urn bernard blackstone observes that indolence has been variously thought the first second and final of the five <year> odes
biographer robert gittings suggests ode on indolence was written on <num> may <year> based upon keats 's report about the weather during the ode 's creation douglas bush insists it was written after nightingale grecian urn and melancholy
based on his examination of the stanza forms keats biographer andrew motion thinks ode on indolence was written after ode to psyche and ode to a nightingale although he admits there is no way to be precise about the dates
nevertheless he argues that ode on indolence was probably composed last
this pattern is used in ode on melancholy ode to a nightingale and ode on a grecian urn which further unifies the poems in their structure in addition to their themes
the poem contains a complicated use of assonance the repetition of vowel sounds as evident in line <num> o why did ye not melt and leave my sense where the pairs ye leave and melt sense share vowel sounds
a more disorganized use of assonance appears in line <num> a third time pass 'd they by and passing turn 'd in which the pairs third turn 'd time by and pass 'd passing share vowel sounds
the first line exemplifies the poem 's consistent iambic pentameter scansion keats occasionally inverts the accent of the first two syllables of each line or a set of syllables within the middle of a line
<num>
<num> of the internal syllables are inverted in the ode on indolence whereas only <num>
<num> of the internal syllables of his other poems contain such inversions
it begins with a classical scene from an urn in a similar manner to ode on a grecian urn but the scene in indolence is allegorical
the opening describes three figures that operate as three fates one morn before me were three figures seen with bowed necks and joined hands side @-@ faced and one behind the other stepp 'd serene in placid sandals and in white robes graced they pass 'd like figures on a marble urn when shifted round to see the other side they came again as when the urn once more is shifted round the first seen shades return and they were strange to me as may betide with vases to one deep in phidian lore
lines <num> – <num> the figures remain mysterious as they circle around the narrator
eventually they turn towards him and it is revealed that they are ambition love and poesy the themes of the poem a third time pass 'd they by and passing turn 'd each one the face a moment whiles to me then faded and to follow them i burn 'd and ached for wings because i knew the three the first was a fair maid and love her name the second was ambition pale of cheek and ever watchful with fatigued eye the last whom i love more the more of blame is heap 'd upon her maiden most unmeek — i knew to be my demon poesy
lines <num> – <num> the poet wishes to be with the three figures but he is unable to join them
when the poet sees the figures he wants to know their names and laments his ignorance
eventually he realizes that they are representative of love ambition and poetry
while he longs he fears they are out of reach and therefore tries to reject them
he argues that love is what he needs least and dismisses it by questioning what love actually means what is love and where is it
he rejects ambition but it requires more work and for that poor ambition — it springs from a man 's little heart 's short fever @-@ fit
unlike the personas of love and ambition the narrator is unable to find a reason to banish poesy poetry which reflects the poets inner conflict should he abandon poetry to focus on a career in which he can earn a decent living keats 's sought to write great poetry but feared his pursuit of literary prominence was based on a delusional view of his own merit as a poet
further he was incapable of completing his epic hyperion
as walter jackson bate explains to keats neither a finished grand poem nor even the semblance of a modest financial return seemed nearer
keats realized that he could never have love could not fulfil his ambition and could not spend his time with poesy
the conclusion of ode to indolence is a dismissal of both the images and his poetry as figures that would only mislead him
even indolence itself seems unattainable andrew motion writes that the figures force keats to regard indolence as the privilege of the leisured class to which he did not belong
if the poem is read as the final poem in the <year> ode series ode on indolence suggests that keats is resigned to giving up his career as a poet because poetry cannot give him the immortality he wanted from it
ironically the poem provided keats with such immortality
besides the biographical component the poem also describes keats 's belief that his works should capture the beauty of art while acknowledging the harshness of life
in this way the poems as a group capture keats 's philosophy of negative capability the concept of living with unreconciled contradictory views by trying to reconcile keats 's desire to write poetry and his inability to do so by abandoning poetry altogether and accepting life as it is
within the many poems that explore this idea — among them keats 's and the works by his contemporaries — keats begins by questioning suffering breaks it down to its most basic elements of cause and effect and draws conclusions about the world
his own process is filled with doubt but his poems end with a hopeful message that the narrator himself is finally free of desires for love ambition and poesy
the hope contained within ode on indolence is found within the vision he expresses in the last stanza i yet have visions for the night and for the day faint visions there is store
consequently in her analysis of the odes of john keats helen vendler suggests that ode on indolence is a seminal poem constructed with themes and images that appeared more influential in his other sometimes later poems
the ode is an early and entirely original work that establishes the basis of keats 's notion of soul making a method by which the individual builds his or her soul through a form of education consisting of suffering and personal experience
this is a fundamental preoccupation of the romantics who believed the way to reconcile man and nature was through this soul development education — the combination of experience and contemplation — and that only this process not the rationality of the previous century would bring about true enlightenment
the classical influences keats invoked affected other romantic poets but his odes contain a higher degree of allusion than most of his contemporaries works
as for the main theme indolence and poetry the poem reflects the emotional state of being keats describes in an early <year> letter to his brother george i ndolent and supremely careless
from my having slumbered till nearly eleven
please has no show of enticement and pain no unbearable frown
neither poetry nor ambition nor love have any alertness of countenance as they pass by me they seem rather like three figures on a greek vase — a man and two women — whom no one but myself could distinguish in their disguisement
willard spiegelman in his study of romantic poetry suggests that the indolence of the poem arises from the narrator 's reluctance to apply himself to the labour associated with poetic creation
some critics provide other explanations and william ober claims that keats 's description of indolence may have arisen from the use of opium
walter evert wrote that it is unlikely that the ode on indolence has ever been anyone 's favorite poem and it is certain that it was not keats 's
why he excluded it from the <year> volume we do not know but it is repetitious and declamatory and structurally infirm and these would be reasons enough
bate indicated that the poem 's value is primarily biographical and not poetic
ode on indolence is sometimes called upon as a point of comparison when discussing keats 's other poems
charles wentworth dilke observed that while the poem can be read as a supplemental text to assist the study of grecian urn it remains a much inferior work
in <year> thomas mcfarland wrote in consideration of dilke 's comparison far more important than the similarity which might seem to arise from the urns in keats 's purview in both ode on indolence and ode on a grecian urn
is the enormous dissimilarity in the two poems
ode on indolence
is a flaccid enterprise that hardly bears mention alongside that other achievement
sidney colvin in his <year> biography on keats grouped indolence with the other <year> odes in categorizing keats 's class of achievements
in <year> lord gorell described the fifth stanza as lacking the magic of what the world agrees are the great odes but describes the language as d elicate charming even
later in a <year> biography of keats gittings describes the importance of the poem the whole ode in fact has a borrowed air and he acknowledged its lack of success by not printing it with the others
yet with its acceptance of the numb dull and indolent mood as something creative it set the scene for all the odes that followed
in <year> stuart sperry described it as a rich and nourishing immersion in the rush of pure sensation and its flow of stirring shadows and dim dreams
in many ways the ode marks both a beginning and an end
it is both the feeblest and potentially the most ambitious of the sequence
yet its failure if we choose to consider it that is more the result of deliberate disinclination than any inability of means
andrew motion in <year> argued like melancholy the poem is too articulate for its own poetic good
in two of his may odes melancholy and indolence keats defined themes common to the whole group with such fierce candour that he restricted their imaginative power
his identity had prevailed
in <year> he was listed by the times higher education guide as the sixth most @-@ cited author in the humanities and social sciences behind anthony giddens and ahead of jürgen habermas
goffman was the <num> president of the american sociological association
his best @-@ known contribution to social theory is his study of symbolic interaction
this took the form of dramaturgical analysis beginning with his <year> book the presentation of self in everyday life
goffman 's other major works include asylums <year> stigma <year> interaction ritual <year> frame analysis <year> and forms of talk <year>
his major areas of study included the sociology of everyday life social interaction the social construction of self social organization framing of experience and particular elements of social life such as total institutions and stigmas
he was from a family of ukrainian jews who had emigrated to canada at the turn of the century
he had an older sibling frances bay who became an actress
the family moved to dauphin manitoba where his father operated a successful tailoring business
from <year> goffman attended st
john 's technical high school in winnipeg where his family had moved that year
in <year> he enrolled at the university of manitoba majoring in chemistry
he interrupted his studies and moved to ottawa to work in the film industry for the national film board of canada established by john grierson
later he developed an interest in sociology
also during this time he met the renowned north american sociologist dennis wrong
their meeting motivated goffman to leave the university of manitoba and enroll at the university of toronto where he studied under c
w
m
hart and ray birdwhistell graduating in <year> with a ba in sociology and anthropology
later he moved to the university of chicago where he received an ma <year> and phd <year> in sociology
for his doctoral dissertation from december <year> to may <year> he lived and collected ethnographic data on the island of unst in the shetland islands
in <year> goffman married angelica choate in <year> their son thomas was born
angelica suffered from mental illness and committed suicide in <year>
outside his academic career goffman was known for his interest and relative success in the stock market and in gambling
at one point in pursuit of his hobbies and ethnographic studies he became a pit boss at a las vegas casino
in <year> goffman married sociolinguist gillian sankoff
the following year their daughter alice was born
in <year> goffman died in philadelphia pennsylvania on <num> november of stomach cancer
their daughter alice goffman is also a sociologist
after graduating from the university of chicago in <year> – <num> he was an assistant to the athletic director at the national institute for mental health in bethesda maryland
participant observation done there led to his essays on mental illness and total institutions which came to form his second book asylums essays on the social situation of mental patients and other inmates <year>
in <year> goffman became a faculty member in the sociology department at the university of california berkeley first as a visiting professor then from <year> as a full professor
in <year> he moved to the university of pennsylvania receiving the benjamin franklin chair in sociology and anthropology due largely to the efforts of dell hymes a former colleague at berkeley
in <year> he became a fellow of the american academy of arts and sciences
in <year> goffman became a cofounder of the american association for the abolition of involuntary mental hospitalization and coauthored its platform statement
in <year> he published relations in public in which he tied together many of his ideas about everyday life seen from a sociological perspective
another major book of his frame analysis came out in <year>
he received a guggenheim fellowship for <year> – <num>
in <year> goffman received the cooley @-@ mead award for distinguished scholarship from the section on social psychology of the american sociological association
he was elected the <num> president of the american sociological association serving in <year> – <num> he was however unable to deliver the presidential address in person due to progressing illness
posthumously in <year> he received the mead award from the society for the study of symbolic interaction
lloyd warner
hughes was the most influential of his teachers according to tom burns
gary alan fine and philip manning state that goffman never engaged in serious dialogue with other theorists
his work has however influenced and been discussed by numerous contemporary sociologists including anthony giddens jürgen habermas and pierre bourdieu
though goffman is often associated with the symbolic interaction school of sociological thought he did not see himself as a representative of it and so fine and manning conclude that he does not easily fit within a specific school of sociological thought
his ideas are also difficult to reduce to a number of key themes his work can be broadly described as developing a comparative qualitative sociology that aimed to produce generalizations about human behavior
goffman made substantial advances in the study of face @-@ to @-@ face interaction elaborated the dramaturgical approach to human interaction and developed numerous concepts that have had a massive influence particularly in the field of the micro @-@ sociology of everyday life
many of his works have concerned the organization of everyday behavior a concept he termed interaction order
he contributed to the sociological concept of framing frame analysis to game theory the concept of strategic interaction and to the study of interactions and linguistics
with regard to the latter he argued that the activity of speaking must be seen as a social rather than a linguistic construct
from a methodological perspective goffman often employed qualitative approaches specifically ethnography most famously in his study of social aspects of mental illness in particular the functioning of total institutions
overall his contributions are valued as an attempt to create a theory that bridges the agency @-@ and @-@ structure divide – for popularizing social constructionism symbolic interaction conversation analysis ethnographic studies and the study and importance of individual interactions
his influence extended far beyond sociology for example his work provided the assumptions of much current research in language and social interaction within the discipline of communication
impression management is defined as when an individual attempts to present an acceptable image to those around him or her verbally or nonverbally <num>
this definition is based on goffman ’ s idea that individuals see themselves as others view them so in essence they attempt to see themselves as if they are outside looking in <num>
goffman also dedicating this work to discover the subtle ways humans present acceptable images by concealing information that may conflict with the images for a particular situation
for instance concealing tattoos when applying for a job in which tattoos would be inappropriate or hiding a bizarre obsession such as collecting interacting with dolls which society as a whole may see as abnormal
goffman does break from his connection with george herbert mead and herbert blumer in that while he does not reject the way in which individuals perceive themselves he was more interested in the actual physical proximity or the “ interaction order ” that molds the self <num>
in other words goffman believed that impression management can only be achieved if the audience is in sync with the individual ’ s perception of self
if the audience is in disagreement with the image an individual is presenting then the individual ’ s presentation of self is interrupted
individuals present images of themselves based on how society thinks they should act in a particular situation
this decision on how to act is decided based on the concept of definition of the situation
the definition are all predetermined and individuals choose how they will act by choosing the proper behavior for the social situation they are in
goffman draws from william thomas for this concept as well
thomas believed that people are born into a particular social class and so the definitions of the situations will encounter have been previously defined for them <num>
for instance when an individual from a high class background goes to a black tie affair the predefined definition of situation would be that they must mind their manors and act according to their class
in <year> goffman was listed by the times higher education guide as the sixth most @-@ cited author in the humanities and social sciences behind anthony giddens and ahead of jürgen habermas
his popularity with the general public has been attributed to his writing style described as sardonic satiric jokey and as ironic and self @-@ consciously literary and to its being more accessible than that of most academics
his style has also been influential in academia and is credited with popularizing a less formal style in academic publications
his students included carol brooks gardner charles goodwin marjorie goodwin john lofland gary marx harvey sacks emanuel schegloff david sudnow and eviatar zerubavel
despite his influence according to fine and manning there are remarkably few scholars who are continuing his work nor has there been a goffman school thus his impact on social theory has been simultaneously great and modest
fine and manning attribute the lack of subsequent goffman @-@ style research and writing to the nature of his signature style which they consider very difficult to duplicate even mimic @-@ proof and also to his writing style and subjects not being widely valued in the social sciences
with regard to his style fine and manning remark that he tends to be seen either as a scholar whose style is difficult to reproduce and therefore daunting to those who might wish to emulate his style or as a scholar whose work was transitional bridging the work of the chicago school and that of contemporary sociologists and thus of less interest to sociologists than the classics of either of those two groups
with regard to his subjects fine and manning observe that the topic of behavior in public places is often stigmatized as being trivial and thus unworthy of serious scholarly attention
nonetheless fine and manning note that goffman is the most influential american sociologist of the twentieth century
elliott and turner see him as a revered figure – an outlaw theorist who came to exemplify the best of the sociological imagination and perhaps the first postmodern sociological theorist
his master 's thesis was a survey of audience responses to a radio soap opera big sister
one of its most important elements was a critique of his research methodology – of experimental logic and of variable analysis
other writings of the period include symbols of class status <year> and on cooling the mark out <year>
his doctoral dissertation communication conduct in an island community <year> presented a model of communication strategies in face @-@ to @-@ face interaction and focused on how everyday life rituals affect public projections of self
he had developed the book 's core ideas from his doctoral dissertation
it was goffman 's first and most famous book for which he received the american sociological association 's <year> maciver award
goffman describes the theatrical performances that occur in face @-@ to @-@ face interactions
he holds that when an individual comes in contact with another person he attempts to control or guide the impression that the other person will form of him by altering his own setting appearance and manner
at the same time the person that the individual is interacting with attempts to form an impression of and obtain information about the individual
goffman also believes that participants in social interactions engage in certain practices to avoid embarrassing themselves or others
society is not homogeneous we must act differently in different settings
this recognition led goffman to his dramaturgical analysis
he saw a connection between the kinds of acts that people put on in their daily lives and theatrical performances
in a social interaction as in a theatrical performance there is an onstage area where actors individuals appear before the audience this is where positive self @-@ concepts and desired impressions are offered
but there is as well a backstage – a hidden private area where individuals can be themselves and drop their societal roles and identities
regardless of whether goffman coined the term total institution he popularized it with his <year> book asylums essays on the social situation of mental patients and other inmates
the book has been described as ethnography of the concept of the total institution
the book was one of the first sociological examinations of the social situation of mental patients in psychiatric hospitals and a major contribution to understanding of social aspects of mental illness
the book is composed of four essays characteristics of total institutions <year> the moral career of the mental patient <year> the underlife of a public institution a study of ways of making out in a mental hospital and the medical model and mental hospitalization some notes on the vicissitudes of the tinkering trades
the first three essays focus on the experiences of patients the last on professional @-@ client interactions
goffman is mainly concerned with the details of psychiatric hospitalization and with the nature and effects of the process he calls institutionalization
he describes how institutionalization socializes people into the role of a good patient someone dull harmless and inconspicuous – a condition which in turn reinforces notions of chronicity in severe mental illness
total institutions greatly affect people 's interactions yet even in such places people find ways to redefine their roles and reclaim their identities
asylums has been credited with helping catalyze the reform of mental health systems in a number of countries leading to reductions in the numbers of large mental hospitals and of the individuals locked up in them
it has also been influential in the anti @-@ psychiatry movement
he draws distinctions between several types of public gatherings gatherings situations social occasions and types of audiences acquainted versus unacquainted
stigma pertains to the shame that a person may feel when he or she fails to meet other people 's standards and to the fear of being discredited – which causes the individual not to reveal his or her shortcomings
thus a person with a criminal record may simply withhold that information from fear of being judged by whomever that person happens to encounter
the first four were originally published in the <num> the fifth in <year> and the last was written for the collection
they include on face @-@ work <year> embarrassment and social organization <year> the nature of deference and demeanor <year> alienation from interaction <year> mental symptoms and public order <year> and where the action is
the first essay on face @-@ work discusses the concept of face which is the positive self @-@ image that an individual holds when interacting with others
goffman believes that face as a sociological construct of interaction is neither inherent in nor a permanent aspect of the person
once an individual offers a positive self @-@ image of him or herself to others that individual feels a need to maintain and live up to that image
inconsistency in how a person projects him or herself in society risks embarrassment and discrediting
therefore people remain guarded to ensure that they do not show themselves to others in an unfavorable light
it discusses the compatibility of game theory with the legacy of the chicago school of sociology and with the perspective of symbolic interactionism
it is one of his few works that clearly engage with that perspective
goffman 's view on game theory was shaped by the works of thomas schelling
goffman presents reality as a form of game and discusses its rules and the various moves that players can make the unwitting the naive the covering the uncovering and the counter @-@ uncovering
this book is thus about the organization of experience rather than the organization of society
a frame is a set of concepts and theoretical perspectives that organize experiences and guide the actions of individuals groups and societies
frame analysis then is the study of the organization of social experience
to illustrate the concept of the frame goffman gives the example of a picture frame a person uses the frame which represents structure to hold together his picture which represents the content of what he is experiencing in his life
the most basic frames are called primary frameworks
a primary framework takes an individual 's experience or an aspect of a scene that would originally be meaningless and makes it meaningful
one type of primary framework is a natural framework which identifies situations in the natural world and is completely biophysical with no human influences
the other type of framework is a social framework which explains events and connects them to humans
an example of a natural framework is the weather and an example of a social framework is a meteorologist who predicts the weather
focusing on the social frameworks goffman seeks to construct a general statement regarding the structure or form of experiences individuals have at any moment of their social life
goffman saw this book as his magnum opus but it was not as popular as his earlier works
the frame analyses of talk in frame analyses erving goffman provides a platform for understanding and interpreting the interaction between individuals engaging speech communication
in the chapter “ the frame analyses of talk ” the focus is put on how words are exchanged and what is being said specifically in informal talk or conversation
the concept of framing is introduced through an exploration of why misunderstandings occur in these basic everyday conversations
he argues that they are more errors in verbal framing than anything else
the types of frames goffman is considering are discussed in previous sections of the book “ fabrications keyings frame breaks misframing and of course frame disputes
” that a frame can assume so many forms is the basis of his analyses “ these framings are subject to a multitude of different transformations the warrant for a frame analysis in the first place
” goffman ’ s key idea is that most conversation is simply a replaying of a strip – what he describes as a personal experience or event
when we talk with others the speaker ’ s goal is often always the same to provide “ evidence for the fairness or unfairness of his current situation and other grounds for sympathy approval exoneration understanding or amusement
and what his listeners are primarily obliged to do is to show some kind of audience appreciation
essentially through interaction we are only looking to be heard not inspire any kind of action but simply to know that someone listened and understood
this is why often a simple head nod or grunt is accepted as an appropriate response in conversation
goffman explains that the way a conversation is keyed is critical to understanding the intent behind many utterances in everyday speech
key is probably best understood as the tone of the dialogue which can change numerous times during an interaction
signaling a change in key is one way that framing often takes place “ special brackets will have to be introduced should he want to say something in a relatively serious way kidding aside now i 'm really serious about this and other such tags become necessary as a means of momentarily down keying the flow of words
” folklorist richard bauman builds heavily on goffman ’ s work specifically on the idea of key in his work pertaining to an analysis of the performance frame
bauman details that a performance is dependent on it being properly keyed without this the display will not be successful
his work on performance analyses is deeply indepted to what goffman establishes here in “ frame analyses
” context is one other element to framing that is essential
the participants will be bound by norms of good manners through frequency and length of turns at talk through topics avoided through circumspection in regard to references about self through attention offered eagerly or begrudgingly @-@ through all these means rank and social relationship will be given their due
certain things can and will be said in one scenario that would never be uttered in another
an awareness of these social framings is critical just as is an awareness of the audience
depending on who you ’ re speaking with a teacher a child a loved one a friend a pet etc
you will curve your speech to fit the frame of what your intended audience is expecting
goffman uses the metaphor of conversation being a stage play
a plays tone will shift throughout the performance due to the actions taken by the actors this is similar to how a discussion is keyed – based on what either person says or does over the course of an interaction the key will change accordingly
the parallels go further though
goffman also claims that a speaker details a drama more often than they provide information
they invite the listener to empathize and as was explained above they ’ re often not meant to be stirred to take action but rather to show appreciation during a play this generally takes the form of applause
other similarities include engaging in the suspense the speaker is attempting to create
in both scenarios you must put aside the knowledge that the performers know the outcome of the event being relayed and in a sense play along
this is integral to his stance as he explains “ the argument that much of talk consists of replayings and that these make no sense unless some form of storyteller 's suspense can be maintained shows the close relevance of frame @-@ indeed the close relevance of dramaturgy @-@ for the organization of talk
” lastly because the replaying of strips is not extemporaneous but rather preformulated it is yet another parallel between a stage production and conversation
all of these things work in concert to provide a foundation of how talk is framed
the book is a visual essay about sex roles in advertising differences in the depictions of men and women and the subtle underlying messages about the sexual roles projected by masculine and feminine images in advertising as well as and symbolism in advertising
in the book goffman examined over <num> advertisements in order to find general patterns in stereotypical gender representation which he placed into six categories relative size goffman argues that social situation is expressed through the relative size of the persons in the advertisements with men showing their superiority through their girth and height
feminine touch women are frequently depicted touching persons or objects in a ritualistic manner occasionally just barely touching the object or person
function ranking when a man and woman are shown in a collaborative manner the male is more likely to be shown as the higher ranked person than the woman
the family when families are depicted in advertising parents are shown to be closer to their children of the same gender and in some instances men are shown separate from the rest of the family in a protective manner
ritualization of subordination difference is expressed by lowering oneself physically
superiority and disdain holding the body erect and the head high
licensed withdrawal goffman states that women in advertisements are frequently depicted as removed from the scene around them either physically turning away from the scene or appearing lost in thought
in her <year> work measuring up how advertising affects self @-@ image vickie rutledge shields stated that the work was unique at the time for employing a method now being labeled semiotic content analysis and that it provided the base for textual analyses
such as poststructuralist and psychoanalytic approaches
she also noted that feminist scholars like jean kilbourne built their highly persuasive and widely circulated findings on the nature of gender in advertising on goffman 's original categories
each essay addresses both verbal and non @-@ verbal communication through a sociolinguistic model
the book provides a comprehensive overview of the study of talk
in the introduction goffman identifies three themes that recur throughout the text ritualization participation framework and embedding
the first essay replies and responses concerns conversational dialogue and the way people respond during a conversation both verbally and non @-@ verbally
the second essay response cries considers the use of utterances and their social implications in different social contexts
specifically goffman discusses self @-@ talk talking to no one in particular and its role in social situations
next in footing goffman addresses the way that footing or alignment can shift during a conversation
the fourth essay the lecture originally an oral presentation describes different types and methods of lecture
lastly in radio talk goffman describes the types and forms of talk used in radio programming and the effect they have on listeners

he further concluded that the clip is all about scenery and the beauty of the trio
in their book music video and the politics of representation diane railton and paul watson felt that the presence of men seems utterly superfluous to the video 's spectacle of female bodies and female pleasures
they further noted that the video 's imagery and performance managed to proceed without a reference to its lyrics and elaborated indeed the abstracted emptiness of its desert spaces the posed tableaux of the women 's bodies and the noticeable lack of attention directed to its male subjects by both the camera and the group does not simply jar with the lyrical narrative of female subordination but in fact reinforces the image of destiny 's child as independent women who are in control of their own lives
that is to say the video re establishes an image of women who are in control of their own bodies their own desires their relationship with men and their friendships with women
the song was performed on june <num> during the <year> bet awards in los angeles

they operated a bookstore and teaching center for a short while and then began to travel around the u
s
in <year> to spread their views
they only gained one convert
in <year> applewhite was arrested for failing to return a rental car and was jailed for six months
in jail he further developed his theology
after applewhite 's release he traveled to california and oregon with nettles eventually gaining a group of committed followers
applewhite and nettles told their followers that they would be visited by extraterrestrials who would provide them with new bodies
applewhite initially stated that he and his followers would physically ascend to a spaceship where their bodies would be transformed but later he came to believe that their bodies were the mere containers of their souls which would later be placed into new bodies
these ideas were expressed with language drawn from christian eschatology the new age movement and american popular culture
the group received an influx of funds in the late <num> which it used to pay housing and other expenses
in <year> nettles died leaving applewhite distraught and challenging his views on physical ascension
in the early <num> the group took more steps to publicize their theology
in <year> they learned of the approach of comet hale – bopp and rumors of an accompanying spaceship
they concluded that this spaceship was the vessel that would take their spirits on board for a journey to another planet
believing that their souls would ascend to the spaceship and be given new bodies the group members committed mass suicide in their mansion
a media circus followed the discovery of their bodies
in the aftermath commentators and academics discussed how applewhite persuaded people to follow his commands including suicide
some commentators attributed his followers willingness to commit suicide to his skill as a manipulator while others argued that their willingness was due to their faith in the narrative that he constructed
and his wife louise née winfield he had three siblings
the son of a presbyterian minister applewhite became very religious as a child
applewhite attended corpus christi high school and austin college at the latter school he was active in several student organizations and was moderately religious

he then taught at the university of alabama
he lost his position there after pursuing a sexual relationship with a male student his religious education was likely not supportive of same @-@ sex relationships and he was subsequently frustrated by his sexual desires
he separated from his wife when she learned of the affair in <year> and they divorced three years later
after leaving the university of alabama applewhite moved to houston texas in <year> to teach at the university of st
thomas
his students regarded him as an engaging speaker and a stylish dresser
he served as chair of the music department he also became a locally popular singer serving as the choral director of an episcopal church and performing with the houston grand opera
in texas he was briefly openly gay but also pursued a relationship with a young woman who left him under pressure from her family greatly upsetting him
he resigned from the university of st
thomas in <year> citing depression and other emotional problems
robert balch and david taylor sociologists who studied applewhite 's group speculate that this departure was prompted by another affair between applewhite and a student
the president of the university later recalled that he was often mentally jumbled and disorganized near the end of his employment
in <year> applewhite briefly moved to new mexico where he operated a delicatessen
he was popular with customers but decided to return to texas later that year
his father died around that time the loss took a significant emotional toll on him causing severe depression
his debts mounted forcing him to borrow money from friends
the two quickly became close friends he later recalled that he felt like he had known her for a long time and concluded that they had met in a past life
she told him their meeting had been foretold to her by extraterrestrials persuading him that he had a divine assignment
by that time he had begun to investigate alternatives to traditional christian doctrine including astrology
he also had had several visions including one in which he was told that he was chosen for a role like that of jesus
in her <year> profile of applewhite susan raine speculates that he had a schizophrenic episode around this time
applewhite soon began to live with nettles
although they cohabited their relationship was not a sexual one fulfilling his longtime wish to have a deep and loving yet platonic relationship
she was married with two children but after she became close with applewhite her husband divorced her and she lost custody of her children
applewhite permanently broke off contact with his family as well
he saw nettles as his soulmate and some of his acquaintances later recalled that she had a strong influence on him
raine writes that nettles was responsible for reinforcing his emerging delusional beliefs but psychiatrist robert jay lifton speculates that nettles influence helped him avoid further psychological deterioration
applewhite and nettles opened a bookstore known as the christian arts center which carried books from a variety of spiritual backgrounds
they also launched a venture known as know place to teach classes on mysticism and theosophy
they closed these businesses a short time later
in february <year> they resolved to travel to teach others about their beliefs and drove throughout the southwest and western u
s lifton describes their travels as a restless intense often confused peripatetic spiritual journey
while traveling they had little money and occasionally resorted to selling their blood or working odd jobs for much @-@ needed funds
they subsisted solely on bread rolls at times often camped out and sometimes did not pay their lodging bills
one of their friends from houston corresponded with them and agreed to accept their teachings
they visited her in may <year> and she became their first convert
while traveling applewhite and nettles pondered the life of st
francis of assisi and read works by authors including helena blavatsky r
d
laing and richard bach
they kept a king james version of the bible with them and studied several passages from the new testament focusing on teachings about christology asceticism and eschatology
applewhite also read science fiction including works by robert a
heinlein and arthur c
clarke
by june <year> applewhite and nettles beliefs had solidified into a basic outline
they concluded that they had been chosen to fulfill biblical prophecies and that they had been given higher @-@ level minds than other people
they wrote a pamphlet that described jesus reincarnation as a texan a thinly veiled reference to applewhite
furthermore they concluded that they were the two witnesses described in the book of revelation and occasionally visited churches or other spiritual groups to speak of their identities often referring to themselves as the two or the ufo two
they believed that they would be killed and then restored to life and in view of others transported onto a spaceship
this event which they referred to as the demonstration was to prove their claims
to their dismay these ideas received a poor reception
he was extradited to st
louis and jailed for six months
at the time he maintained that he had been divinely authorized to keep the car
while jailed he pondered theology and subsequently abandoned discussion of occult topics in favor of extraterrestrials and evolution
after applewhite 's release he and nettles resolved to contact extraterrestrials and they sought like @-@ minded followers
they published advertisements for meetings where they recruited disciples whom they called crew
at the events they purported to represent beings from another planet the next level who sought participants for an experiment
they claimed that those who agreed to take part in the experiment would be brought to a higher evolutionary level
he and nettles referred to themselves as guinea and pig
applewhite described his role as a lab instructor and served as the primary speaker while nettles occasionally interjected clarifying remarks or corrections
the two seldom personally spoke with attendees only taking phone numbers with which they could contact them
they initially named their organization the anonymous sexaholics celibate church but it soon became known as the human individual metamorphosis
applewhite believed in the ancient astronaut hypothesis which claimed that extraterrestrials had visited humanity in the past and placed humans on earth and would return to collect a select few
parts of this teaching bear similarities to the reformed christian concept of election likely owing to applewhite 's presbyterian upbringing
he often discussed extraterrestrials using phrases from star trek and stated that aliens communicated with him through the show
applewhite and nettles sent advertisements to groups in california and were invited to speak to new age devotees there in april <year>
at this meeting they persuaded about half of the <num> attendees to follow them
they also focused on college campuses speaking at cañada college in august
at a meeting in oregon in september <year> they saw further recruitment success — about <num> people left their homes to follow the pair prompting interest from media outlets
the coverage was negative commentators and some former members mocked the group and leveled accusations of brainwashing against applewhite and nettles
balch and taylor state that applewhite and nettles eschewed pressure tactics seeking only devoted followers
benjamin e
zeller an academic who studies new religions notes that applewhite and nettles teachings focused on salvation through individual growth and sees this as similar to currents in the era 's new age movement
likewise the importance of personal choice was also emphasized
applewhite and nettles denied connection with the new age movement viewing it as a human creation
janja lalich a sociologist who studies cults attributes their recruitment success to their eclectic mix of beliefs and the way that they deviate from typical new age teachings discussing literal spaceships while retaining familiar language
most of their disciples were young and interested in occultism or otherwise lived outside of mainstream society
they came from a variety of religious backgrounds including eastern religions and scientology
most were well versed in new age teachings allowing applewhite and nettles to convert them easily
applewhite thought that his followers would reach a higher level of being changing like a caterpillar becoming a butterfly this example was used in almost all of their early literature
applewhite contended that this would be a biological change into a different species casting his teachings as scientific truth in line with secular naturalism
he emphasized to his early followers that he was not speaking metaphorically often using the words biology and chemistry in his statements
by the mid @-@ <num> he attempted to avoid the use of the term religion seeing it as inferior to science
although he dismissed religion as unscientific he sometimes emphasized the need for faith in the aliens abilities to transform them
they had about <num> followers and saw themselves as shepherds tending a flock
applewhite believed that complete separation from earthly desires was a prerequisite of ascension to the next level and emphasized passages in the new testament in which jesus spoke about forsaking worldly attachments
members were consequently instructed to renounce friends family media drugs alcohol jewelry facial hair and sexuality
furthermore they were required to adopt biblical names
applewhite and nettles soon told them to adopt two @-@ syllable names that ended in ody and had three consonants in the first syllable such as rkkody jmmody and lvvody applewhite stated that these names emphasized that his followers were spiritual children
applewhite nettles and their followers lived what religious scholar james lewis describes as a quasi @-@ nomadic lifestyle
they usually stayed at remote campgrounds and did not speak about their beliefs
applewhite and nettles ceased having public meetings in april <year> and spent little time teaching doctrine to their converts
the leaders also had little contact with their dispersed followers many of whom renounced their allegiance
applewhite and nettles feared that they would be assassinated and taught their followers that their deaths would be similar to those of the two witnesses of the book of revelation
balch and taylor believe that applewhite 's prison experience and early rejection by audiences contributed to this fear
applewhite and nettles later explained to their followers that the former 's treatment by the press was a form of assassination and had fulfilled their prophecy
applewhite took a materialistic view of the bible seeing it as a record of extraterrestrial contact with humanity
he drew heavily from the book of revelation although he avoided traditional theological terminology and took a somewhat negative tone towards christianity
he only lectured about a small number of verses and never tried to develop a system of theology
by early <year> applewhite and nettles had settled on the names do and ti applewhite stated that these were meaningless names
in june <year> they gathered their remaining followers at medicine bow national forest in southeastern wyoming promising a ufo visit
nettles later announced that the visit had been cancelled
applewhite and nettles then split their followers into small groups which they referred to as star clusters from <year> to <year> the group lived in campgrounds usually in the rocky mountains or texas
applewhite and nettles began to place greater demands on their followers heretofore loosely structured lives which improved membership retention
they typically communicated with their disciples in writing or through assistants
increasingly they emphasized that they were the only source of truth — the idea that members could receive individual revelations was rejected in an attempt to prevent schisms
applewhite also sought to prevent close friendships among his followers fearing that this could lead to insubordination
applewhite and nettles insisted that their followers practice what they referred to as flexibility strict obedience to their often shifting requests
the two leaders limited the group 's contacts with those outside the movement even some who may have been interested in joining ostensibly to prevent infiltration from hostile parties
in practice this made their followers completely dependent upon them
applewhite instructed his disciples to be like children or pets in their submission — their sole responsibility was to obey their leaders
members were encouraged to constantly seek applewhite 's advice and often ask themselves what their leaders would do when making a decision
to his followers he did not seem dictatorial many of them found him laid back and fatherly
in his <year> study of the group winston davis states that applewhite mastered the fine art of religious entertainment noting that many of his disciples seemed to enjoy their service
applewhite organized seemingly arbitrary rituals that were intended to instill a sense of discipline in his followers he referred to these tasks as games
he also watched science @-@ fiction television programs with the rest of the group
rather than issue direct commands he attempted to express his preferences and nominally offer his disciples a choice
he emphasized that students were free to disobey if they chose in what lalich dubs the illusion of choice
this capital was used to rent houses initially in denver and later in dallas
applewhite and nettles had about <num> followers then and lived in two or three houses the leaders usually had their own house
the group was secretive about their lifestyle covering their windows
applewhite and nettles arranged their followers lifestyles as a boot camp that would prepare them for the next level
referring to their house as a craft they regimented the lives of their disciples to the minute
students who were not committed to this lifestyle were encouraged to leave departing members were given financial assistance
lifton states that applewhite wanted quality over quantity in his followers although he occasionally spoke about gaining many converts
applewhite and nettles sometimes made sudden drastic changes to the group
on one occasion in texas they told their followers of a forthcoming visitation from extraterrestrials and instructed them to wait outside all night at which point they informed them that this had been merely a test
lalich sees this as a way that they increased their students devotion ensuring that their commitment became irrespective of what they saw
members became desperate for applewhite 's approval which he used to control them
in <year> applewhite and nettles had about <num> followers many of whom held jobs often working with computers or as car mechanics
in <year> applewhite and nettles allowed their disciples to call their families
they further relaxed their control in <year> permitting their followers to visit relatives on mother 's day
they were only allowed short stays and were instructed to tell their families that they were studying computers at a monastery
these vacations were intended to placate families by demonstrating that the disciples remained with the group of their own accord
she lived for two more years dying in <year>
applewhite told their followers that she had traveled to the next level because she had too much energy to remain on earth abandoning her body to make the journey
his attempt to explain her death in the terms of the group 's doctrine was successful preventing the departure of all but one member
applewhite became very depressed
he claimed that nettles still communicated with him but he suffered from a crisis of faith
his students supported him during this time greatly encouraging him
he then organized a ceremony in which he symbolically married his followers lalich views this as an attempt to ensure unity
applewhite told his followers that he had been left behind by nettles because he still had more to learn — he felt that she occupied a higher spiritual role than he did
he began identifying her as the father and often referred to her with male pronouns
applewhite began to emphasize a strict hierarchy teaching that his students needed his guidance as he needed the guidance of the next level
zeller notes that this naturally ensured that there would be no possibility of the group 's continuing if applewhite were to die
a relationship with applewhite was said to be the only way to salvation he encouraged his followers to see him as christ
zeller states that the group 's previous focus on individual choice was replaced with an emphasis on applewhite 's role as a mediator
applewhite maintained some aspects of their scientific teachings but in the <num> the group became more like a religion in its focus on faith and submission to authority
after nettles death applewhite also altered his view of ascension previously he had taught that the group would physically ascend from the earth and that death caused reincarnation but her death which left behind an unchanged corporeal body forced him to say that the ascension could be spiritual
he then concluded that her spirit had traveled to a spaceship and received a new body and that he and his followers would do the same
in his view the biblical heaven was actually a planet on which highly evolved beings dwelt and physical bodies were required to ascend there
applewhite believed that once they reached the next level they would facilitate evolution on other planets
he emphasized that jesus whom he believed was an extraterrestrial came to earth was killed and bodily rose from the dead before being transported onto a spaceship
according to applewhite 's doctrine jesus was a gateway to heaven but had found humanity unready to ascend when he first came to the earth
applewhite then decided that there was an opportunity for humans to reach the next level every two millennia and the early <num> would therefore provide the first opportunity to reach the kingdom of heaven since the time of jesus
zeller notes that his beliefs were based on the christian bible but were interpreted through the lens of belief in alien contact with humanity
applewhite taught that he was a walk @-@ in a concept that had gained popularity in the new age movement during the late <num>
walk @-@ ins were said to be higher beings who took control of adult bodies to teach humanity
this concept informed applewhite 's view of resurrection he believed that his group 's souls were to be transported to a spaceship where they would enter other bodies
applewhite abandoned the metaphor of a butterfly in favor of describing the body as a mere container a vehicle that souls could enter and exit
this dualism may have been the product of the christology that applewhite learned as a young man lewis writes that the group 's teachings had christian elements that were basically grafted on to a new age matrix
in a profile of the group for newsweek kenneth woodward compares his dualism to that of ancient christian gnosticism although peters notes that his theology departs from gnosticism by privileging the physical world
in the wake of nettles death applewhite became increasingly paranoid fearing a conspiracy against his group
one member who joined in the mid @-@ <num> recalled that applewhite avoided new converts worrying that they were infiltrators
he feared a government raid on their home and spoke highly of the jewish defenders of masada in ancient israel who showed total resistance to the roman empire
increasingly he began to discuss the apocalypse comparing the earth to an overgrown garden that was to be recycled or rebooted and humanity to a failed experiment
in accordance with the garden metaphor he stated that the earth would be spaded under
woodward notes that applewhite 's teaching about the earth 's recycling is similar to the cyclical perspective of time found in buddhism
applewhite also utilized new age concepts but he differed from that movement by predicting that apocalyptic rather than utopian changes would soon occur on earth
he contended that most humans had been brainwashed by lucifer but that his followers could break free of this control
he specifically cited sexual urges as the work of lucifer
in addition he stated that there were evil extraterrestrials whom he referred to as luciferians who sought to thwart his mission
he argued that many prominent moral teachers and advocates of political correctness were actually luciferians
this theme emerged in <year> possibly in response to the lurid alien abduction stories that were proliferating at the time
in <year> they mailed a document that detailed their beliefs to a variety of new age organizations
the mailing contained information about their history and advised people to read several books which primarily focused on christian history and ufos
with the exception of the <year> document applewhite 's group remained inconspicuous until <year> when they recorded a <num> @-@ part video series which was broadcast via satellite
this series echoed many of the teachings of the <year> update although it introduced a universal mind of which its hearers could partake
over the course of the group 's existence several hundred people joined and left
in the early <num> their membership dwindled numbering as few as <num> these defections gave applewhite a sense of urgency
in may <year> the group took the name total overcomers anonymous
they then spent <num> @,@ <num> to publish a full @-@ page advertisement in usa today that warned of catastrophic judgment to befall the earth
its publication led about <num> former members to rejoin the group
this along with a series of public lectures in <year> caused membership to double from its nadir at the beginning of the decade
by this time applewhite did not regiment his disciples lives as strictly as he had and spent less time with them
in the early <num> applewhite posted some of his teachings on the internet but he was stung by the resulting criticism
that year he first spoke of the possibility of suicide as a way to reach the next level
he explained that everything human had to be forsaken including the human body before one could ascend
the organization was then renamed heaven 's gate
davis speculates that this rejection may have encouraged him to attempt to leave earth
from june to october <year> the group lived in a rural part of new mexico
they purchased <num> acres <num>
<num> km2 and built a compound — which they referred to as the earth ship — using tires and lumber applewhite hoped to establish a monastery
this proved to be a difficult endeavor particularly for the aging applewhite he was in poor health and at one point feared that he had cancer
lifton notes that applewhite 's active leadership of the group probably led to severe fatigue in his last years
the winter was very cold and they abandoned the plan
afterwards they lived in several houses in the san diego area
the group increasingly focused on the suppression of sexual desire applewhite and seven others opted for surgical castration
they initially had difficulty finding a willing surgeon but eventually found one in mexico
in applewhite 's view sexuality was one of the most powerful forces that bound humans to their bodies and thus hindered their efforts to evolve to the next level he taught that next level beings had no reproductive organs but that luciferian beings had genders
he also cited a verse in the new testament that said there would not be marriage in heaven
in addition he required members to adopt similar clothing and haircuts possibly to reinforce that they were a non @-@ sexual family
that year they recorded two video messages in which they offered their viewers a last chance to evacuate earth
around the same time they learned of the approach of comet hale – bopp
applewhite now believed that nettles was aboard a spaceship trailing the comet and that she planned to rendezvous with them
he told his followers that the vessel would transport them to an empyrean destination and that there was a government conspiracy to suppress word of the craft
in addition he stated that his deceased followers would be taken by the vessel as well a belief that resembled the christian pretribulation rapture doctrine
it is not known how he learned of the comet or why he believed that it was accompanied by extraterrestrials or why he should have believed the dead nettles would be with them
in late march <year> the group isolated themselves and recorded farewell statements
many members praised applewhite in their final messages davis describes their remarks as regurgitations of do 's gospel
applewhite recorded a video shortly before his death in which he termed the suicides the final exit of the group and remarked we do in all honesty hate this world
lewis speculates that applewhite settled on suicide because he had said that the group would ascend during his lifetime and thus appointing a successor was unfeasible
religious scholar catherine wessinger posits that the suicides began on march <num>
most members took barbiturates and alcohol and then placed bags over their heads
they wore nike shoes and black uniforms with patches that read heaven 's gate away team
a bag that contained a few dollars and a form of identification was placed beside most bodies
the deaths occurred over three days applewhite was one of the last four to die
three assistants helped him commit suicide then killed themselves
an anonymous tip led the sheriff 's department to search the mansion they found <num> bodies there on march <num>
it is the largest group suicide that has occurred in the u
s
applewhite 's body was found seated on the bed of the mansion 's master bedroom
medical examiners determined that his fears of cancer had been unfounded but that he suffered from coronary atherosclerosis
the deaths provoked a media circus and applewhite 's face was featured on the covers of time and newsweek on april <num>
his final message was widely broadcast hugh urban of ohio state university describes his appearance in the video as wild @-@ eyed and rather alarming
lalich speculates that they were willing to follow applewhite in suicide because they had become totally dependent upon him and hence were poorly suited for life in his absence
davis attributes applewhite 's success in convincing his followers to commit suicide to two factors he isolated them socially and cultivated an attitude of complete religious obedience in them
applewhite 's students had made a long @-@ term commitment to him and balch and taylor infer that this is why his interpretations of events appeared coherent to them
most of the dead had been members for about <num> years although there were a few recent converts
lewis argues that applewhite effectively controlled his followers by packaging his teachings in familiar terms
richard hecht of the university of california santa barbara echoes this sentiment arguing that members of the group killed themselves because they believed the narrative that he had constructed rather than because he psychologically controlled them
in his <year> study of apocalyptic movements john r
hall posits that they were motivated to commit suicide because they saw it as a way to demonstrate that they had conquered the fear of death and truly believed applewhite
urban writes that applewhite 's life displays the intense ambivalence and alienation shared by many individuals lost in late twentieth @-@ century capitalist society
he notes that applewhite 's condemnations of contemporary culture bear similarities to those of jean baudrillard at times particularly their shared nihilist views
urban posits that applewhite found no way other than suicide to escape the society that surrounded him and states that death offered him a way to escape its endless circle of seduction and consumption
while covering the suicides several media outlets focused on applewhite 's sexuality the new york post dubbed him the gay guru
gay rights activist troy perry argued that applewhite 's repression and society 's rejection of same @-@ sex relationships ultimately led to his suicide
this idea has failed to gain support among academics
zeller argues that applewhite 's sexuality was not the primary driving force behind his asceticism which he believes resulted from a variety of factors though he grants sexuality a role
lalich states that applewhite fit the traditional view of a charismatic leader and evan thomas deems him a master manipulator
lifton compares applewhite to shoko asahara the founder of aum shinrikyo describing him as equally controlling his paranoia and megalomania gentler yet ever present
christopher partridge of lancaster university states that applewhite and nettles were similar to john reeve and lodowicke muggleton who founded muggletonianism a millennialist movement in <num> century england
it was started in <year> as the press organ of the labour party in hedemarken and its adjoining regions and was called demokraten the democrat until <year>
it was issued three days a week between <year> and <year> six days a week in <year> three days a week again between <year> and <year> before again increasing to six days a week
it was renamed to arbeideren in <year> and in the same year it was taken over by the norwegian communist party
the communist party incorporated the newspaper gudbrandsdalens arbeiderblad into arbeideren in <year> and until <year> the newspaper was published under the name arbeideren og gudbrandsdalens arbeiderblad
after arbeideren had gone defunct the name was used by the communist party for other newspapers elsewhere
the chief editors of the newspaper were olav kringen <year> – <year> ole holmen <year> – <year> fredrik monsen <year> – <year> paul o
løkke <year> – <year> alfred aakermann <year> – <year> olav larssen <year> – <year> and finally trond hegna ingvald b
jacobsen olav scheflo eivind petershagen and jørgen vogt between <year> and <year>
fredrik monsen evald o
solbakken and knut olai thornæs were acting editors from <year> to <year>
rasmussen started a second newspaper oplands @-@ posten in hamar later in <year> to compete with his own demokraten
an organ for the social liberal labour movement in the district arbeiderbladet existed from <year> to <year> and was published out of different cities including in hamar in the year <year>
a countywide chapter of the labour party was established in hedmark in mid @-@ november <year>
after the countywide party convention in stange in <year> the convention summary had to be printed in the kristiania @-@ based newspaper social @-@ demokraten as it lacked its own local newspaper
the county board thus decided to buy <num> @,@ <num> copies of the social @-@ demokraten to distribute to its members
there was a growing notion that the party needed its own newspaper
in the same year the labour movement in solør south of hedmark bought the paper solungen which had existed since <year>
the takeover came into effect on <num> january <year> and publishing began the following year
solungen pretended to be the labour movement organ for the whole of hedmark and outside of solør it was published as hedemarkens amts socialdemokrat solungen
however the rest of hedmark county was not satisfied with this solution
the initiator and first editor was olav kringen who had ample experience as the editor of social @-@ demokraten from <year> until <year>
demokraten was the labour party organ for the mjøsa cities and hedemarken but in its first years it also covered gudbrandsdalen and østerdalen two northern regions
the name østoplandenes socialistiske partiblad was considered for the newspaper but the historical name demokraten prevailed
the name was suggested by local labour mp karl amundsen
demokraten 's coverage of gudbrandsdalen soon ended and in southern østerdalen a new labour newspaper østerdalens arbeiderblad was set up in <year>
in northern østerdalen arbeidets rett was popular among the labour movement
according to reports in demokraten the newspaper again began to cover news from a part of gudbrandsdalen namely the city lillehammer in <year>
when it came to building up a new newspaper kringen had a certain personal drive as he ran for parliament in <year>
when he lost the election he also lost interest to a certain degree
he resigned in <year> and ole holmen a member of the vang municipal council took over as chief editor
however he ran afoul of other people involved with the newspaper and was fired in <year>
the newspaper originally had the tagline socialistisk blad for oplandene socialist paper for oplandene but in <year> this was changed to talsmand for arbeiderbevægelsen spokesman for the labour movement
it was printed by the company a
sæther
the newspaper was issued three times a week until <num> july <year> from which point it was increased to six times a week
as part of this ambitious increase demokraten also had <num> @,@ <num> copies in circulation unprecedented in its history
olav larssen started his journalist career as a subeditor in the same year
in the newspaper 's supervisory council vote monsen edged out waldemar carlsen with <num> to <num> votes and also prevailed over other applicants who were seasoned editors such as ingvald førre and eugène olaussen
larssen prevailed over carlsen and førre in the vote for the new subeditor
only monsen and larssen were employed in the newspaper to work with editorial content
in <year> monsen managed to contract known personalities from the labour movement as regular contributors
these were the nationally known figures olav kringen gunnar ousland and johan falkberget in addition to lillehammer politician petter nilssen and the locally known politicians arne juland later mp and andr
juell
danish expatriate alfred kruse joined in the autumn of <year>
however according to larssen the prominent writers contracted to demokraten seldomly wrote anything
in his memoirs larssen wrote that monsen was often aggressive as editor @-@ in @-@ chief especially when writing editorials
he got several adversaries in the city 's conservative community especially after donning a badge with the broken rifle a well @-@ known anti @-@ war symbol
the newspaper competed with the old and popular conservative hamar stiftstidende the liberal left oplandenes avis and the liberal oplandet
the practice of issuing the newspaper six days a week became harder after the outbreak of the first world war
the war caused a general rise in prices and newspaper subscriptions and advertisements both declined
demokraten had to revert to being issued three times a week starting <num> september <year>
in december <year> it adopted a new tagline organ for arbeiderpartiet i hamar og hedemarksbygdene organ for the labour party in hamar and the hamlets of hedemarken
the next editors were paul o
løkke who served from <year> to <year> and alfred aakermann from <year> to <year>
larssen returned in <year> as editor @-@ in @-@ chief
georg svendsen was the subeditor from <year> until <year> when evald o
solbakken started in the newspaper as subeditor
still there were only two people to deliver the editorial content
as the war years went the newspaper 's finances gradually improved
the norwegian state became more active in production and trade and contributed many advertisements
demokraten acquired its own type @-@ setting machine in october <year> and a printing press in <year> which it used from <num> january <year>
from <num> july <year> circulation once again increased to six days a week
the change followed a letter in <year> from the comintern executive which stated that no newspaper belonging to a comintern member organization should have social democrat or democrat as a part of its title
the printing press of the party changed its name accordingly to arbeiderens trykkeri
in the same year <year> the labour party broke out of the comintern
subsequently the communist party broke away from the labour party
the local chapter of the labour party in hamar decided to side with the communist party in november <year> in a <num> – <num> vote
arbeideren was then taken away from labour as the supervisory council decided by a <num> to <num> vote that it should follow the communists
arbeideren was one of thirteen labour newspapers that broke away from the party and followed the communists one nordlys later returned to labour
since <num> february <year> the newspaper was published under the name arbeideren og gudbrandsdalens arbeiderblad as the communist party had seen fit to merge arbeideren with lillehammer @-@ based gudbrandsdalens arbeiderblad
editor larssen and subeditor solbakken both joined the communist party in <year> and continued running the newspaper
as olav larssen was asked by the party to be the acting editor of norges kommunistblad in the winter of <year> – <year> fredrik monsen evald solbakken and knut olai thornæs were acting editors between <year> and <year>
larssen eventually drifted away from the mainstream of the communist party
in late <year> and early <year> he voiced his opinion in columns that the communist party should contribute to the imminent merger of the labour party and the social democratic labour party
a local party convention strongly rebuked this opinion
larssen was thus replaced in january <year> and left the communist party and solbakken soon followed suit
fredrik monsen left the party at the same time
information differs as to who replaced larssen
according to evald solbakken and also to the reference bibliography norske aviser <year> – <year> the replacement was olav scheflo who needed a stand @-@ in ingvald b
jacobsen for the first period
according to the encyclopaedia arbeidernes leksikon and historian einhart lorenz trond hegna was the editor in <year> before he took over norges kommunistblad in the summer of <year>
hegna 's main job was to edit the periodical mot dag but in this period the people of mot dag had an informal influence on the communist party and several of their newspapers
scheflo formally edited the newspaper from <year> to <year> with eivind petershagen as acting editor from late <year>
in <year> petershagen formally took over only to have jørgen vogt become acting editor later that year
vogt took over in <year>
as many newspapers belonging to the dwindling communist party arbeideren would cease to exist before the end of the <num>
it was still published six times a week but had to give up its printing press in <year> switching to samtrykk in oslo
the last ever issue of arbeideren og gudbrandsdalens arbeiderblad was published on <num> october <year>
this new paper was based in oslo as the replacement of norges kommunistblad which had been liquidated as well
olav larssen and evald solbakken found a new outlet in hamar arbeiderblad which had been set up as the new hamar organ of the labour party in <year>
the communist party later tried to create a weekly newspaper in hamar rød front but it was short @-@ lived and existed only between <year> and <year>
the oslo version of arbeideren went defunct in <year> and many years after that the name was used from <year> to <year> for a third newspaper published in brumunddal not far from hamar city
it was released on march <num> <year> via the playstation network
in journey the player controls a robed figure in a vast desert traveling towards a mountain in the distance
other players on the same journey can be discovered and two players can meet and assist each other but they cannot communicate via speech or text and cannot see each other 's names
the only form of communication between the two is a musical chime
this chime also transforms dull stiff pieces of cloth found throughout the levels into vibrant red affecting the game world and allowing the player to progress through the levels
the robed figure wears a trailing scarf which when charged by approaching floating pieces of cloth briefly allows the player to float through the air
the developers sought to evoke in the player a sense of smallness and wonder and to forge an emotional connection between them and the anonymous players they meet along the way
the music composed by austin wintory dynamically responds to the player 's actions building a single theme to represent the game 's emotional arc throughout the story
reviewers of the game praised the visual and auditory art as well as the sense of companionship created by playing with a stranger calling it a moving and emotional experience and have since listed it as one of the greatest games of all time
journey won several game of the year awards and received several other awards and nominations including a best score soundtrack for visual media nomination for the <year> grammy awards
a retail collector 's edition including journey thatgamecompany 's two previous titles and additional media was released on august <num> <year>
the game was released digitally for the playstation <num> on july <num> <year> and a physical edition was released on october <num> <year>
after an introductory sequence the player is shown the robed figure sitting in the sand with a large mountain in the distance
the path towards this mountain the ultimate destination of the game is subdivided into several sections traveled through linearly
the player can walk in the levels as well as control the camera which typically follows behind the figure either with the analog stick or by tilting the motion @-@ sensitive controller
the player can jump with one button or emit a wordless shout or musical note with another the length and volume of the shout depends on how the button is pressed and the note stays in tune with the background music
these controls are presented pictorially in the beginning of the game at no point outside of the credits and title screen are any words shown or spoken
the robed figure wears a trailing magical scarf which allows the player to briefly fly doing so uses up the scarf 's magical charge represented visually by glowing runes on the scarf
the scarf 's runes are recharged by walking or a variety of other means
touching glowing symbols scattered throughout the levels lengthens the initially vestigial scarf allowing the player to remain airborne longer
larger strips of cloth are present in the levels and can be transformed from a stiff dull gray to vibrant red by singing near them
doing so may have effects on the world such as releasing bits of cloth forming bridges or levitating the player
this in turn allows the player to progress in the level by opening doors or allowing them to reach previously inaccessible areas
the robed figure does not have visible arms to manipulate the game world directly
along the way the player encounters flying creatures made of cloth some of which help the player along
in later levels the player also encounters hostile creatures made of stone which upon spotting the player rip off parts of the figure 's scarf
in each level the player may come across one other player temporarily connected to their game
when players approach each other they charge one another 's scarves
they cannot communicate with each other beyond patterns of singing
players can help each other by activating strips of cloth or showing paths but cannot hinder each other and are not necessary for completing any level
when two players finish a section at the same time they remain together into the next one otherwise they are connected to new players when they move on
while all of the figures generally look the same without gender or distinguishing characteristics individual players can be told apart by unique symbols which are shown floating in the air when they sing and are displayed on their robes at all times
the entire game takes about two to three hours to complete
the player 's character begins on a sand dune in a seemingly endless desert
in the far distance looms a large foreboding mountain with a glowing crevice that splits its peak
as the character approaches the mountain they find remnants of a once @-@ thriving civilization eroded by sand over time
scattered throughout the ruins at the end of each area are stones at which the traveler rests these stones give the traveler the vision of meeting a larger white @-@ robed figure in a circular room with art on the walls describing the rise and fall of the civilization mirroring the player 's journey
the player must also contend with the ancient automatons left over from a war which ended the civilization and which still roam the city looking for intruders
the player continues to journey deeper into the remains of a once sprawling city at the base of the mountain
eventually making it safely to the mountain the traveler begins to climb it struggling as they enter the colder climates and encounter deep snow and high winds
with the crevice still a fair distance away the traveler falls and collapses in the snow
six of the white @-@ robed figures appear before the character and grant the traveler new energy allowing the player to reach the summit of the mountain and walk into and through the crevice as the screen fills with white
the player is then shown the game 's credits playing over the ending cinematic
this cinematic shows a shooting star emanating from the crevice and traversing the path the traveler took through the ruins and shows glimpses of other robed travelers heading towards the mountain
eventually the star comes to rest at the sand dune where the game began and the player is given the option of starting the game again
as the credits end the player is shown the playstation network ids of the other travelers who shared part of the trek
development of the game began in <year> after the release of thatgamecompany 's previous title flower
the <num> @-@ person development team for journey was composed mainly of creators of the company 's previous games co @-@ founder jenova chen was the creative director and nick clark returned as lead designer
kellee santiago producer of flow and flower did not reprise her duties concentrating instead on her role as the company 's president and was replaced by robin hunicke
when development began sony expected the game to be completed in a year rather than the more than three it finally took
thatgamecompany always expected needing an extension according to hunicke they believed finishing the game within a year was unrealistic
development ended up taking even longer than anticipated as the team had difficulties paring down their ideas for the game and maintaining efficient communication
over the course of development the team grew from seven to eighteen people
at the end of the second year when sony 's extension had run out the game did not spark the emotions in the player that the team wanted
sony agreed to another one @-@ year extension but development ultimately exceeded even that
the stress of the project led to the feeling there was not enough time or money to complete everything the team wished to which added to the stress and caused arguments about the design of the game
the developers ended up reducing the overtime they spent on the project to avoid burning out though it meant further delays and risked the company running out of money as the game neared completion
in a speech at the <num> annual d
i
c
e
awards in <year> chen admitted that the company had indeed been driven to bankruptcy in the final months of development and that some of the developers had gone unpaid at the time
hunicke described the solution to finally finishing the game as learning to let go of tensions and ideas that could not make it into the game and be nice to each other
the game is intended to make the player feel small and to give them a sense of awe about their surroundings
the basic idea for the game as designed by chen was to create a game that moved beyond the typical defeat kill win mentality of most video games
the team initially created a prototype named dragon that involved players trying to draw away a large monster from other players but eventually discarded it after finding it was too easy for players to ignore each other in favor of their own objectives
the developers designed the game like a japanese garden where they attempted to remove all of the game elements that did not fit with the others so the emotions they wanted the game to evoke would come through
this minimalism is intended to make the game feel intuitive to the player so they can explore and feel a sense of wonder without direct instructions
the story arc of the game is designed to explicitly follow joseph campbell 's monomyth theory of narrative or hero 's journey so as to enhance the emotional connection of the players as they journey together
in his d
i
c
e
speech chen noted that three of their <num> testers had cried upon completing the game
the multiplayer component of journey was designed to facilitate cooperation between players without forcing it and without allowing competition
it is intended to allow the players to feel a connection to other people through exploring with them rather than talking to them or fighting them
the plan was to create a game where people felt they are connected with each other to show the positive side of humanity in them
the developers felt the focus on caring about the other player would be diluted by too many game elements such as additional goals or tasks as players would focus on those and ignore the other player
they also felt having text or voice communication between players or showing usernames would allow players biases and preconceptions to come between them and the other player
the game was released on march <num> <year> for download on the playstation network
a playstation home game space or themed area based on journey was released on march <num> <year> and is similar in appearance to the game
a retail collector 's edition of the game was released on august <num> <year>
in addition to journey the disc @-@ based title includes flow and flower creator commentaries art galleries and soundtracks for all three games non @-@ related minigames and additional content for the playstation <num>
in september <year> sony and thatgamecompany released a hardcover book entitled the art of journey by the game 's art director matt nava containing pieces of art from the game ranging from concept art to final game graphics
on july <num> <year> journey was released on the playstation network for the playstation <num> ported by united kingdom studio tricky pixels owners of the digital playstation <num> version of the game were able to download the new version for free
wintory worked closely on the soundtrack with sound designer steve johnson as well as the programming team so the music would dynamically tie in to both the actions of the player and sound effects caused by nearby game objects and feel as if it were unfolding in real time
johnson felt having short pieces of music that looped without reacting to the player would be a missed opportunity and wanted to create music that changed while still containing a composed emotional arc
jenova chen met with wintory at the start of the game 's development to describe his vision for the project and wintory left the meeting and composed and recorded the main cello theme for the soundtrack that night
he continued to work on the soundtrack for the next three years experimenting and discarding many ideas
the game 's orchestrations were performed by the skopje radio symphonic orchestra in macedonia
unlike many games where different songs have different themes for each character or area wintory chose to base all of the pieces on one theme which stood for the player and their journey with cello solos especially representing the player
wintory describes the music as like a big cello concerto where you are the soloist and all the rest of the instruments represent the world around you though he describes it as not necessarily orchestral due to the inclusion of electronic aspects
the cello begins the game as immersed in a sea of electronic sound before first emerging on its own and then merging into a full orchestra mirroring the player 's journey to the mountain
while the game 's art style is based on several different cultures wintory tried to remove any overt cultural influences from the music to make it as universal and culture @-@ less as possible
tina guo features as the cellist for the soundtrack
she is a close friend of wintory and has since performed woven variations with him an eight @-@ minute orchestral variation on the journey soundtrack
all of the non @-@ electronic instruments in the soundtrack were recorded with a live orchestra
the soundtrack was released as an album on april <num> on itunes and the playstation network
the album is a collection of the soundtrack 's most important pieces arranged by wintory to stand alone without the context of the player 's actions
the album comprises <num> tracks and is over <num> minutes long
it features the voice of lisbeth scott for the final track i was born for this
after its release the soundtrack reached the top <num> of the itunes soundtrack charts in more than <num> countries
it also reached no
<num> on the billboard sales charts with over <num> units sold in its first week after release the second @-@ highest position of any video game music album to date
the soundtrack was released as a physical album by sumthing else music works on october <num> <year>
in <year> wintory released a download @-@ only album of music on bandcamp titled journey bonus bundle which includes variations on themes from journey and flow
the soundtrack itself was subsequently released on bandcamp on june <num> <year>
an album of piano arrangements titled transfiguration was released on may <num> <year> on bandcamp as both a digital and physical album
a two @-@ record vinyl version of the album was released in <year>
in january <year> wintory started a kickstarter for a journey live concert tour in which the fifteen @-@ piece fifth house ensemble from chicago will perform the music from the game while a player works their way through the game
the ensemble will react to the player 's actions using a specially @-@ scored version of the soundtrack composed by patrick o 'malley with wintory 's oversight that breaks the music into small pieces to enable this reaction
wintory had wanted to do a performance of the journey soundtrack in this interactive manner but did not have the time to rework the soundtrack for this purpose
wintory came to know dan visconti the composer for fifth house ensemble after visconti published his praise for the journey soundtrack and had encouraged other members of the ensemble to play the game
the group saw how journey 's soundtrack had been used for various video games live concerts and believed they could pull off wintory 's vision of an interactive concert doing most of the reworking of the soundtrack under wintory 's direction
sony has provided wintory with a version of the game developed by tricky pixels that disables the music to allow the ensemble to provide this and other modifications required for the concert performance
the kickstarter was launched for <num> @,@ <num> in funding for a four @-@ city tour but within a few days already surpassed its funding levels allowing for more cities to be included
after its release it became the fastest @-@ selling game to date on playstation store in both north america and europe

it received the ign best overall game award for <year> and ryan clements of ign described the game as the most beautiful game of its time saying each moment is like a painting expertly framed and lit
jane douglas of gamespot concurred calling it relentlessly beautiful and lauding the visual diversity of the world and the depiction of the rippling sand matt miller of game informer added praise for the animation of the sand and creatures saying the game was visually stunning
the music was also complimented with miller describing it as a breathtaking musical score and douglas calling it moving dynamic music
reviewers were especially pleased with the emotional experience of playing the game particularly with other players
christian donlan of eurogamer described it as a non @-@ denominational religious experience that with the addition of another player moves beyond metaphors and becomes a pilgrimage to the player
a reviewer writing for edge magazine said the emotional arc of the game hits with occasionally startling power while patrick shaw from wired said the game made him feel a wide range of emotions
wonder fear even sadness
miller said all three times he played the game each time without fail individual moments
managed to give me goosebumps and those moments have remained on my mind for weeks afterward
joel gregory of playstation official magazine praised the game 's story for being open to the player 's interpretation leaving an ambiguity that drew him in
the addition of an unnamed second player was described by donlan as brilliant and as a master stroke and edge said it made for a more absorbing more atmospheric experience
the few criticisms for the game centered on its length and pacing
clements noted that not all players would appreciate a game with a deliberate melancholic pace and short duration comments echoed by the edge review
miller noted the lack of a complex gameplay elements in journey and shaw was disappointed that the game was only a few hours long though douglas said the length was perfect
miller concluded the game could be compared to a musical concert a well @-@ directed film or a long @-@ awaited book while clements concluded completing journey will create memories that last for years
gold the central of the five areas was located between port @-@ en @-@ bessin on the west and la rivière on the east
high cliffs at the western end of the zone meant that the landings took place on the flat section between le hamel and la rivière in the sectors code @-@ named jig and king
taking gold was to be the responsibility of the british army with sea transport mine sweeping and a naval bombardment force provided by the royal navy as well as elements from the dutch polish and other allied navies
the objectives at gold were to secure a beachhead move west to capture arromanches and establish contact with the american forces at omaha capture bayeux and the small port at port @-@ en @-@ bessin and to link up with the canadian forces at juno to the east
forces attacking gold faced elements of the german <num> infantry division and german <num> infantry division

the fourth gun resumed firing intermittently in the afternoon and its garrison surrendered on <num> june
aerial attacks had failed to hit the le hamel strongpoint which had its embrasure facing east to provide enfilade fire along the beach and had a thick concrete wall on the seaward side
its <num> mm gun continued to do damage until <num> <num> when a modified armoured vehicle royal engineers avre tank fired a large petard charge into its rear entrance
a second casemated emplacement at la rivière containing an <num> mm gun was neutralised by a tank at <num> <num>
meanwhile infantry began clearing the heavily fortified houses along the shore and advanced on targets further inland
the british commandos of no
<num> royal marine commando advanced on port @-@ en @-@ bessin and captured it on <num> june in the battle of port @-@ en @-@ bessin
on the western flank the 1st battalion hampshire regiment captured arromanches future site of one of the artificial mulberry harbours and <num> infantry brigade on the eastern flank made contact with the canadian forces at juno
company sergeant major stanley hollis received the only victoria cross awarded on d @-@ day for his actions while attacking two pillboxes at the mont fleury battery
due to stiff resistance from the german <num> infantry division bayeux was not captured until the next day
british casualties at gold are estimated at <num> @,@ <num> – <num> @,@ <num>
german casualties are unknown
the decision to undertake a cross @-@ channel invasion of continental europe within the next year was taken at the trident conference held in washington in may <year>
the allies initially planned to launch the invasion on <num> may <year> and a draft of the plan was accepted at the quebec conference in august <year>
general dwight d
eisenhower was appointed commander of supreme headquarters allied expeditionary force shaef
general bernard montgomery was named as commander of the 21st army group which comprised all of the land forces involved in the invasion
on <num> december <year> eisenhower and montgomery first saw the plan which proposed amphibious landings by three divisions and two @-@ thirds of an airborne division
the two generals immediately insisted that the scale of the initial invasion be expanded to five divisions with airborne descents by three divisions to allow operations on a wider front
the change doubled the frontage of the invasion from <num> miles <num> km to <num> miles <num> km
this would allow for quicker offloading of men and materiel make it more difficult for the germans to respond and speed up the capture of the port at cherbourg
the need to acquire or produce extra landing craft and troop carrier aircraft for the expanded operation meant that the invasion had to be delayed to june
the americans assigned to land at utah and omaha were to cut off the cotentin peninsula and capture the port facilities at cherbourg
the british at sword and gold and the canadians at juno were to capture caen and form a front line from caumont @-@ l 'éventé to the south @-@ east of caen to protect the american flank while establishing airfields near caen
possession of caen and its surroundings would provide a suitable staging area for a push south to capture the town of falaise
a secure lodgement would be established and an attempt made to hold all territory north of the avranches @-@ falaise line during the first three weeks
the allied armies would then swing left to advance towards the river seine
montgomery envisaged a ninety @-@ day battle ending when all the forces reached the seine
the coast was divided between able west of omaha to rodger on the eastern flank of the invasion area
eight further sectors were added when the planned invasion was extended to include utah
each sector was further subdivided into beaches identified by the colours green red and white
gold did not refer to a particular beach but to a landing area
it was delineated by port @-@ en @-@ bessin on the west and la rivière on the east and included arromanches location of one of the artificial mulberry harbours that were to be constructed shortly after the invasion
high cliffs at the western end of the zone meant that the landings would be undertaken on the flat beach between le hamel and la rivière in the sectors code @-@ named jig and king
the area immediately behind the beach was marshy with open ground and bocage small fields surrounded by hedges and embankments further inland
roads led to the south via asnelles and ver @-@ sur @-@ mer
the terrain to the south @-@ east rose to a ridge at meuvaines where on d @-@ day were located machine gun nests of the german <num> regiment
the allied expeditionary air force undertook over <num> @,@ <num> photo reconnaissance sorties from april <year> until the start of the invasion
photos of the coastline were taken at extremely low altitude to show the invaders the terrain obstacles on the beach and defensive structures such as bunkers and gun emplacements
inland terrain bridges troop emplacements and buildings were also photographed in many cases from several angles to give the allies as much information as possible
members of combined operations pilotage parties clandestinely prepared detailed harbour maps including depth soundings
at gold frogmen discovered the shore between asnelles and la rivière was soft and could not support the weight of tanks
twelve armoured vehicle royal engineers avres were fitted with bobbins to overcome this problem by deploying a roll of matting over the soft surface
the material would then be left in place to create a route for more conventional tanks
gold was assigned to the british xxx corps with the <num> northumbrian infantry division – commanded by major general d
a
h
graham – allotted as the assault division
it was an experienced division that had already seen combat in france north africa and sicily
the men underwent extensive training in amphibious landings including exercise fabius a major training exercise at hayling island in may <year>
demolition teams responsible for disabling underwater beach obstacles trained in swimming pools in the uk
briefings were undertaken using detailed maps that used fictitious place names and most of the men did not find out their destination until they were already on their way to normandy
the amphibious landing was to be preceded by extensive air bombardment as well as naval bombardment by bombarding force k a task force of eighteen ships primarily cruisers and destroyers
amphibious tanks of the <num> armoured brigade were to arrive at <num> <num> followed by infantry at <num> <num>
the 231st brigade was assigned to land at jig and <num> brigade at king
the 231st was to head west to capture arromanches and establish contact with the american forces at omaha while the <num> was to move east and link up with the canadian forces at juno
the <num> royal marine commando was assigned to land at gold infiltrate inland and capture the small port at port @-@ en @-@ bessin from the landward side
arriving in the second wave on jig <num> infantry brigade was to capture bayeux and a nearby ridge thus cutting the n13 highway between caen and bayeux to make it difficult for the germans to move in reinforcements
the second wave on king 151st infantry brigade was tasked with capturing the caen road and railway along with setting up positions on high ground between the aure and seulles rivers
other forces involved in the landing included artillery regiments signals corps and engineering units
rommel believed that the normandy coast could be a possible landing point for the invasion so he ordered the construction of extensive defensive works along that shore
in the immediate area of gold between le hamel and la rivière seven defensive strongpoints designed to hold <num> men apiece were constructed
two major concrete @-@ reinforced coastal artillery emplacements a battery of four <num> mm guns at mont fleury and the longues @-@ sur @-@ mer battery with four <num> mm guns were only partially completed by d @-@ day
rommel ordered wooden stakes metal tripods mines and large anti @-@ tank obstacles to be placed on the beach to delay the approach of landing craft and impede the movement of tanks
expecting the allies to land at high tide so that the infantry would spend less time exposed on the beach he ordered many of these obstacles to be placed at the high tide mark
tangles of barbed wire booby traps and the removal of ground cover made the approach hazardous for infantry
hitler gave rommel command of the newly re @-@ formed army group b which included the <num> army the <num> army and the forces guarding the netherlands
reserves for this group included the <num> 21st and <num> panzer divisions
recognizing that allied air superiority would make it difficult if not impossible to move reserves into position once the invasion was underway rommel decided to concentrate the defences along the coast
the <num> infantry division which had been stationed in the area since march <year> was significantly understrength with only <num> @,@ <num> men
this unit received reinforcements and some of the older men were replaced by younger soldiers
it was also supplemented by several battalions of osttruppen eastern soldiers conscripted soviet prisoners of war
the <num> infantry division a full @-@ strength unit of around <num> @,@ <num> was brought into the area by rommel on <num> march and reinforced by two additional regiments
about <num> @,@ <num> men a mixture from the two infantry divisions were stationed in the coastal area between arromanches and asnelles

when <num> infantry division arrived on <num> march the grandcamps sector was split into the bayeux sector from carentan to asnelles and the caen sector from asnelles to the orne
most of the <num> infantry division remained where they were and thus the defenses in caen sector site of the gold landings were not substantially strengthened

one battalion was stationed near crépon as reserves
at gold naval bombardment by bombarding force k got underway at <num> <num> at which time the first waves of infantry were loading into their landing craft assault lcas for the run in to the beach
german defensive positions were attacked by medium and heavy bombers and by self @-@ propelled guns on board the landing craft
results were good at mont fleury battery and at longues where at <num> <num> ajax and argonaut took out of commission three of the four guns
the fourth gun resumed firing sporadically in the afternoon and the garrison surrendered the following day
two heavily casemated gun emplacements an <num> mm gun at la rivière overlooking king and a <num> mm gun at le hamel overlooking jig were only lightly damaged as they were heavily reinforced with concrete especially on the seaward side
these positions had embrasures that permitted a wide range of enfilade fire on the beach
four other german strong points in the immediate area were also only lightly damaged and had to be individually assaulted as the day progressed
the first wave on king was the <num> east yorkshires and <num> green howards of <num> brigade assisted by amphibious dd tanks of the <num> <num> dragoon guards
the <num> green howards landed at <num> <num>
the original plan called for the <num> dd tanks to be launched from their landing craft tank lcts about <num> @,@ <num> yards <num> @,@ <num> m out
due to extremely choppy seas they decided to run the tanks directly onto the beach
infantry engineers and dd tanks arrived almost simultaneously
units disembarking onto the beach immediately came under fire from the casemated <num> mm gun at la rivière and the infantry were forced to take cover behind the sea wall
the gun was taken out when a flail tank of the westminster dragoons fired a charge directly into its aperture
the <num> east yorkshires supported by several tanks spent the rest of the morning clearing out the heavily fortified houses of la rivière at the loss of <num> men including six officers
specialised armour arriving in the first wave included avres mine flails and armoured bulldozers
clearing paths off the beach proved difficult as the tanks got stuck in the mud or were taken out by mines
a lone mine flail tank finally cleared a path from the beach up toward the mont fleury battery and ver @-@ sur @-@ mer
this route was used by the green howards and tanks of the <num> <num> dragoon guards who cleared the remaining resistance at the mont fleury battery
b company moved on to attack trench positions and machine gun emplacements at meuvaines ridge while c company moved to the west of ver @-@ sur @-@ mer to help cover the assault on crépon where roads led to the important targets of bayeux and caen
the <num> green howards attacked the gun battery at ver @-@ sur @-@ mer where they took <num> prisoners
colour sergeant @-@ major stanley hollis earned the only victoria cross to be bestowed for actions on d @-@ day
on the way to the mont fleury battery hollis came under machine gun fire while investigating a pillbox so he shot into the entrance with his sten gun and dropped a grenade through the roof killing most of the occupants
he cleared a nearby trench of enemy soldiers whereupon the occupants of a second pillbox surrendered
later in the day he saved the lives of three men during an attempt to take out a field artillery installation at a farm near crépon
scheduled to land at <num> <num> on jig the <num> infantry brigade was re @-@ routed king because the gun battery at le hamel was still operational
they proceeded towards their objective of bayeux
151st brigade arrived at the same time and after meeting fierce resistance they achieved their objective of controlling the road and railway between bayeux and caen
<num> brigade made slow progress and had to dig in for the night some distance from bayeux
<num> brigade secured the eastern flank and by nightfall made contact with the canadian forces on juno
due to navigation errors and the strong current both groups came ashore well to the east of their intended landing points
the dd tank and royal marine centaur tanks that were supposed to arrive in advance of the landing were delayed by rough seas and did not arrive until <num> <num>
many of the tanks got bogged down on the beach or were taken out by enemy fire
the tide came in quicker than expected before many of the beach obstacles and mines were cleared and some of the landing craft were damaged as a result
two companies of the 1st hampshires landed very close to the strong point at le hamel and had to fight inland through enemy garrisons to get off the beach
attempts to flank le hamel were made difficult by the surrounding machine gun placements mines and barbed wire
elements of the 1st hampshires captured the german strongpoint wn @-@ <num> at the eastern edge of the village of asnelles
when they turned west to move along the beach towards their primary objective at le hamel they came under heavy fire and had to break off the attack
major warren in charge after the commanding officer lieutenant colonel nelson smith was wounded decided that the troops would have to circle around and attack the emplacement from the rear a process that took several hours
the troops began to have some success around <num> <num> with the arrival of an avre tank of <num> assault squadron
the tank fired two petards into the sanatorium where most of the defenders were located
the german soldiers fled into fortified houses in le hamel and asnelles and were taken out in house @-@ to @-@ house combat
few surrendered
the <num> mm gun was finally silenced at <num> <num> when the avre tank fired a large petard charge into the rear entrance of the casemate

ryes was captured at around <num> <num>
the 1st dorsets attacked a german position on the beach at la cabane des douanes and headed inland to arc westward toward the high ground south of arromanches
they cleared enemy positions at le bulot and puits d 'hérode and arrived at their destination late in the morning
joined by elements of the 1st hampshires and covered by indirect fire from the naval forces offshore they took arromanches late in the afternoon

phillips opted to attack from the south as the site was well protected on the seaward side
the force of <num> men consisted of five troops of <num> men a mortar and machine gun troop a transport group with four tracked vehicles and a headquarters group
the plan was to land at gold at <num> <num> assemble at la rosière and move cross @-@ country to a ridge designated as point <num> south of port @-@ en @-@ bessin arriving at around <num> <num>
here they would call for indirect fire from the supporting vessels at sea and then move in to capture the town

<num> miles <num>
<num> km east of bayeux to launch a counter @-@ attack
fired upon by allied air forces the column finally arrived in the late afternoon at which time they were met by elements of the <num> brigade
the british lost four tanks in the ensuing engagement but the kampfgruppe was almost completely wiped out
meyer was killed and his detailed maps of german coastal emplacements fell into british hands
because allied air superiority meant it would be difficult for the germans to move up their reserves rommel believed that their best chance was to stop the invasion at the shore
the scope of the invasion meant that once these coastal defences were defeated and the troops scattered it was difficult to defend territory inland or launch counter @-@ attacks
at <num> <num> kraiss ordered the <num> division to create a defensive line north of bayeux but this proved impossible as most of the territory involved was already in british hands and all the defending units had taken serious losses
the luftwaffe played only a minor role on d @-@ day
at gold several small groups of bombers that arrived at sunset caused allied casualties at le hamel and damaged a road near ver @-@ sur @-@ mer

most shipments were brought in over the beaches until the port of cherbourg was cleared of mines and obstructions on <num> july
the most important use of the mulberry harbour was the unloading of heavy machinery that could not be brought across the beaches
artificial breakwaters gooseberries sheltered hundreds of ships during the storm of <num> – <num> june and provided shelter for craft unloading stores at juno and sword
a joint anglo @-@ american oil depot was constructed at port @-@ en @-@ bessin fed via buoyed pipes known as tombola from oil tankers moored offshore
using this method <num> @,@ <num> long tons <num> @,@ <num> t of petrol half for the second army was delivered by the end of august by which time the underwater pipelines constructed in operation pluto were ready

the music and lyrics were written in <year> by vincas kudirka when lithuania was still part of the russian empire
the fifty @-@ word poem was a condensation of kudirka 's conceptions of the lithuanian state the lithuanian people and their past
shortly before his death in <year> the anthem was performed for lithuanians living in saint petersburg russia
the first public lithuanian performance of the anthem took place in vilnius in <year> and it became the official national anthem in <year> a year after lithuania declared its independence
following the occupation and annexation of lithuania by the soviet union in <year> the anthem was forbidden to be played or sung in public
tautiška giesmė was reinstated in <year> shortly before the reestablishment of lithuanian independence and confirmed in the national anthem act <num> october <year>
it was automatically included as the national anthem in <year> when the new constitution was ratified after independence from the soviet union was achieved
the status of tautiška giesmė as the national anthem of lithuania was further confirmed in <year> with the passage of a national law stating that
kudirka a medical student at the university of warsaw was writing as a columnist for the newspaper varpas the bell
in his varpas columns kudirka urged lithuanians to take pride in their heritage discussed the problems the russian government was causing the lithuanian population and denounced those who wished to work for the tsarist autocracy
in the course of writing for varpas he wrote down his thoughts on what lithuania was and what it should be resulting in the fifty @-@ word poem lietuva tėvynė mūsų lithuania our homeland
the poem described the heroic past of lithuania and exhorted its people to care for the land care for humanity and live in honor
kudirka also urged the country to become a source of enlightenment and virtue
without a melody kudirka took the time to compose the music just before dying of tuberculosis
both the melody and the lyrics were printed in varpas in september <year>
upon his death in <year> kudirka 's tomb was engraved with the second stanza of the anthem later destroyed by the authorities
petersburg russia in <year>
the concert was conducted by česlovas sasnauskas and was attended by lithuanians which st
petersburg had the largest population of at that time
the anthem was first performed in lithuania during the great seimas of vilnius on december <num> <year>
when lithuania declared its independence from russia in <year> the song was declared the national anthem
it held this status until lithuania was annexed into the soviet union during world war ii
during the interwar period there had been suggestions to modify the words to include a reference to god
it was decided in kudirka 's memory that the lyrics should remain as he had written them
immediately following the soviet occupation of lithuania the internationale replaced the tautiška giesmė
when in <year> the internationale have been replaced by state anthem of the soviet union in soviet union as official anthem tautiška giesmė was used as official anthem for the lithuanian soviet socialist republic
an alternate anthem was created and introduced in <year>
the music for that piece was composed by balys dvarionas and jonas švedas and the words were written originally by antanas venclova
following stalin 's death in <year> its lyrics were modified by vacys reimeris to remove reference to the former dictator
this anthem stated that lenin had lit the path to freedom helped by the russian people and exhorted the lithuanian people to work with peoples of the other soviet republics
the anthem was confirmed in article <num> of the <year> constitution of the lithuanian ssr
the song continued to be used until lithuania broke away from the soviet union
already in <year> the tautiška giesmė was suggested as a replacement for the soviet lithuanian anthem
after preliminary approval by the supreme soviet of the lithuanian ssr and successive legislative bodies its status as the national anthem was reconfirmed in <year>
in that year the constitution of lithuania was approved article <num> of the document states that tautiška giesmė will be the national anthem of lithuania
the last law in relation to the national anthem was passed in <year> it contained the official lyrics and protocol on how and when to play the anthem
article <num> of the law states that the anthem is to be played at the following occasions at the beginning or ending of solemn sessions of the seimas on national holidays and memorial days and at receptions and farewells of foreign heads of state on official visits to lithuania — but only after the anthem of the foreign country has been played
it is played in foreign countries to represent lithuania according to their own diplomatic protocols on national holidays and other days when the flag of lithuania is raised by order of the government when the flag is raised during public events sponsored by governmental institutions business and organizations and at the beginning and end of national radio programming
the anthem may also be played at other occasions such as sporting competitions
when playing the anthem the music may be either live or recorded
the anthem may be performed with a choir an orchestra a military band or a combination of the latter two
article <num> section <num> states that all participants are encouraged to sing the national anthem
when the anthem is played all civilians are asked to stand in a gesture of respect to the anthem
if employees of national defense police and other military or military @-@ related organizations are present they must respect the anthem in a way prescribed by their statutes
the anthem cannot be used as background music purposes of advertisement or for entertainment such as karaoke
public disrespect of the anthem may be punishable by law
it was found by an unnamed metal detectorist near crosby garrett in cumbria england in may <year>
later investigations found that a romano @-@ british farming settlement had occupied the site where the helmet was discovered which was located a few miles away from a roman road and a roman army fort
it is possible that the owner of the helmet was a local inhabitant who had served with the roman cavalry
the helmet appears to have been deliberately folded up and deposited in an artificial stone structure
it is thought to have been used for ceremonial occasions rather than for combat and may already have been an antique by the time it was buried
it is of the same type as the newstead helmet found in <year> and its design also has similarities with the ribchester helmet found in <year> and the hallaton helmet found in <year> though its facial features are more akin to those of helmets found in southern europe
its design may allude to the trojans whose exploits the romans re @-@ enacted in cavalry tournaments
dr ralph jackson senior curator of romano @-@ british collections at the british museum has described the helmet as
an immensely interesting and outstandingly important find
its face mask is both extremely finely wrought and chillingly striking but it is as an ensemble that the helmet is so exceptional and in its specifics unparalleled
it is a find of the greatest national and indeed international significance
on <num> october <year> the helmet was sold at christie 's for £ <num>
<num> million us <num>
<num> million to an undisclosed private buyer
tullie house museum and art gallery in carlisle sought to purchase the helmet with the support of the british museum but was outbid
the helmet has so far been publicly displayed twice once in a <year> exhibition at the royal academy of arts and again at tullie house in <year> @-@ <num>
the visor portrays the face of a youthful clean @-@ shaven male with curly hair
the headpiece is in the shape of a phrygian cap on the crest of which is a winged griffin that stands with one raised foot resting on an amphora
the visor was originally attached to the headpiece by means of a hinge the iron hinge pin has not survived but its existence has been inferred from the presence of powdery deposits of iron oxide residue
the helmet would have been held in place using a leather strap attached from the wearer 's neck to a decorated rivet on either side of the helmet below the ear
wear marks caused by opening and closing the visor are still visible and at some point the helmet was repaired using a bronze sheet which was riveted across two splits
only two other roman helmets complete with visors have been found in britain – the newstead helmet and ribchester helmet
the helmet and visor were cast from an alloy consisting of an average of <num> copper <num> zinc and <num> tin
this alloy was probably derived from melted @-@ down scrap brass with a low zinc content with which some tin had been added to improve the quality of the casting
some of the fragments show traces of a white metal coating indicating that the visor would originally have been tinned to give the appearance of silver
the griffin was cast separately from a different alloy consisting of <num> copper <num> zinc <num> tin and <num> lead
the visor would originally have been a silver hue and the helmet would have had a coppery yellow appearance
the helmet 's creation can be dated to the late <num> or early <num> century from the use of a particular type of decorated rivet as well as some of its design features such as its pierced eyes
there has been much debate about the symbolic meaning of the helmet 's design
the griffin was the companion of nemesis the goddess of vengeance and fate
they were both seen as agents of death and were often linked with gladiatorial combat
the meaning of the face and headpiece are less clearly identifiable
suggestions have ranged from the greek god attis and the hero perseus to the roman gods mithras and jupiter dolichenus to a more general eastern mediterranean appearance that could possibly have been meant to suggest a trojan identity
the phrygian cap was often used by the romans as a visual motif representing the trojans
the finder an unnamed metal detectorist in his <num> from peterlee county durham had been detecting with his father in two adjacent fields for some years but had previously only discovered some roman coins and other small artefacts
the findspot is situated not far from a roman road
a number of earthworks are located nearby indicating the presence of a previously unrecorded ancient settlement
the area was strategically placed on the route to the northern frontier of roman britain within the territory of the carvetii tribe
the roman army would have been present in the area and would certainly have used the nearby road
a roman auxiliary fort stood only <num> kilometres <num>
<num> mi to the north @-@ east at verterae brough castle
following the helmet 's discovery the area around the findspot was investigated in a project sponsored by the tullie house museum and art gallery and the portable antiquities scheme
the earthworks noted earlier were found to be part of a substantial enclosure surrounded by ditches within which buildings had once stood
the enclosure which measures as much as <num> metres <num> @,@ <num> ft long on its southern side combines both native british and roman methods of fortification
a sunken area within the enclosure may possibly have served as a paddock for horses while the evidence for the buildings is concentrated in the enclosure 's northern portion
the remnants of romano @-@ british field systems in the surrounding area show that the area was under cultivation and animal remains found on the site indicate that the inhabitants also raised livestock including sheep goats and pigs
the presence of roman pottery suggests that the inhabitants had adopted some elements of the roman lifestyle but their community may well have been there long before the romans arrived
archaeological evidence from the enclosure indicates that the site may have been first settled as far back as the bronze age at least <num> @,@ <num> years before the helmet was deposited
the finder discovered the helmet and visor buried together some <num> cm <num> in below the surface at a site located on a ledge at the lower end of the settlement
it had been placed onto two stone slabs at the bottom of a hole which had been back @-@ filled with soil
a stone cap had been laid on top
the helmet was found in <num> large fragments and <num> small fragments and had apparently been folded before burial
the visor was mostly intact and had been placed face down
the griffin had become detached and was found with the helmet
no other artefacts were found at the time but the subsequent tullie house pas excavations at the findspot discovered a number of copper and iron objects a bead and two roman coins dating to between <num> @-@ <num>
the coins were found within the artificial stone feature in which the helmet had been deposited and may have been buried at the same time
the finder did not initially realise that he had found a roman artefact and thought at first that it was a victorian ornament
he eventually identified it as roman by consulting auction catalogues searching the internet and getting advice from dealers
find liaison officers from the portable antiquities scheme were notified of the discovery and visited the findspot along with the finder
christie 's commissioned darren bradbury an independent conservator and restorer to restore the helmet and visor for sale
although christie 's was asked to delay the restoration so that a full scientific examination could be carried out this request was not granted and information about the helmet 's burial may have been lost as a result
however the british museum was able to inspect the find during restoration and x @-@ ray fluorescence spectrometry was carried out to determine the composition of the headpiece visor and griffin
bradbury 's restoration work took some <num> hours and involved the repair of cracks and holes using resin and cyanoacrylate retouched to match the appearance of the surrounding material
the visor is a cavalry sports type c h
russell robinson classification or type v maria kohlert classification
similar examples have been found across the roman empire from britain to syria
it is of the same type as the newstead helmet found in scotland in <year> and its facial features most closely parallel a helmet that was found at nola in italy and is now in the british museum
the rendering of the hair is similar to that of a type c helmet found at belgrade in serbia and dated to the <num> century ad
the griffin ornament is unique though it may parallel a lost sphinx of bronze that may originally have been attached to the crest of the ribchester helmet discovered in lancashire in <year>
the headpiece is nearly unique only one other example in the form of a phrygian cap has been found in a fragmentary state at ostrov in romania dated to the second half of the <num> century ad
rings on the back of the helmet and on the griffin may have been used to attach colourful streamers or ribbons
such helmets were used for hippika gymnasia cavalry tournaments that were performed in front of emperors and senior commanders
horses and riders wore lavishly decorated clothes armour and plumes while performing feats of horsemanship and re @-@ enacting historical and legendary battles such as the wars of the greeks and trojans
according to the roman writer arrian t hose of high rank or superior in horsemanship wear gilded helmets of iron or bronze to draw the attention of the spectators
unlike the helmets made for active service these do not cover the head and cheeks only but are made to fit all round the faces of the riders with apertures for the eyes
from the helmets hang yellow plumes a matter of décor as much as utility
as the horses move forward the slightest breeze adds to the beauty of these plumes
— arrian ars tactica <num> combat gear was issued by and belonged to the roman army and had to be returned at the end of a wearer 's service
cavalry sports equipment appears to have been treated differently as soldiers apparently privately commissioned and purchased it for their own use
they evidently retained it after they completed their service
both helmets and visors have been found in graves and other contexts away from obvious military sites as well as being deposited in forts and their vicinity
in some cases they were carefully folded up and buried as in the case of the guisborough helmet
the dutch historian johan nicolay has identified a lifecycle for roman military equipment in which ex @-@ soldiers took certain items home with them as a reminder of their service and occasionally disposed of them away from garrison sites as grave goods or votive offerings
the circumstances in which the crosby garret helmet was buried are still unclear but the discoveries made by the post @-@ discovery tullie house pas excavations have provided much more detail about its context
it was clearly deposited within an artificial feature that had been specially constructed stuart noon of the museum of lancashire suggests that the feature may have been intended as a memorial of some sort
it was not buried in an isolated spot but within a long @-@ occupied romano @-@ british farming settlement that had clearly adopted aspects of roman culture
given the settlement 's proximity to roman military locations it is very possible that some of its inhabitants served with the roman army which often recruited mounted auxiliaries from among native peoples
the helmet may well already have been a valuable antique at the time of its burial if the coins found nearby reflect when it was buried it could have been over a century old by the time it was deposited
it was deliberately broken before being buried in what may have been intended as a ritual sacrifice
the identity of its owner will never be known but it could have been that a local inhabitant who had formerly served with the roman cavalry was responsible for the helmet 's deposition
the finder and landowner were thus free to dispose of the helmet as they saw fit
the discovery was publicly announced by christie 's in mid @-@ september <year> the helmet was the centrepiece of its <num> october auction catalogue featuring on the cover and six more pages
its value was put at £ <num> @,@ <num> – £ <num> @,@ <num> <num> @,@ <num> – <num> @,@ <num>
the tullie house museum and art gallery launched an appeal with the aim of purchasing the helmet and making it the focus of a new roman frontier gallery due to open in <year>
the campaign immediately attracted numerous donations including £ <num> @,@ <num> from an anonymous overseas benefactor who offered the sum if a matching sum could be raised by the public it was a £ <num> million offer from the national heritage memorial fund a £ <num> @,@ <num> pledge from the headley trust and the monument trust £ <num> @,@ <num> from the art fund and £ <num> @,@ <num> from the j paul getty jr charitable trust
by the time of the auction three and a half weeks after the campaign had been launched the museum had raised enough money to support a bid of up to £ <num>
<num> million
behind the scenes efforts were made to persuade the finder and landowner to agree a private sale with the museum but these approaches failed
the initial estimate was passed within seconds of the auction opening
six bidders pushed the price towards a million pounds and tullie house was forced to drop out at £ <num>
<num> million
two remaining bidders took the bid past £ <num> million the winning bidder an anonymous uk resident and fine art collector bidding by phone paid a total of £ <num> @,@ <num> @,@ <num>
<num> including the buyer 's premium and vat
the outcome aroused controversy and prompted calls for the treasure act to be revised though british archaeology noted that the circumstances of the helmet 's discovery may have resulted in it being outside the scope of even a revised act
it is still possible that the helmet could come into public ownership if the winning bidder wishes to export it an export licence would have to be applied for and if a temporary export bar was placed on it an opportunity could arise for funds to be raised by a public institution to purchase the helmet
it was lent by its owner to the royal academy of arts in london and was put on display from <num> september to <num> december <year> as part of an exhibition of bronzes
from <num> november <year> until <num> january <year> the helmet was on display at the tullie house museum and art gallery in carlisle and a printed guide was produced for the occasion
it was subsequently displayed at the british museum from <num> january to <num> april <year>
since his victory in the tournament liu kang becomes the mortal kombat series hero as the champion and chief defender of earthrealm guided by his mentor the thunder god raiden
he also becomes romantically involved with princess kitana the adopted daughter of evil outworld emperor named shao kahn
designed with special moves intended to be easier to perform than the moves of other characters liu kang has appeared in many of the mortal kombat fighting installments in addition to starring with kung lao as the title characters of the action @-@ adventure game mortal kombat shaolin monks and being among the eleven series characters representing the franchise in the crossover game mortal kombat vs
dc universe
liu kang has extensively featured in alternate mortal kombat media and official merchandise serving as the primary protagonist of the two feature @-@ length films and the malibu comics comic book adaptations in addition to supporting roles in other media such as the <year> mortal kombat novel and the animated series mortal kombat defenders of the realm
critical and general reception of the character has been mainly favorable although various aspects have been criticized

enraged liu kang decides to travel to outworld to seek revenge backed by friend and fellow shaolin kung lao
at the tournament liu kang fights shao kahn eventually overpowering the emperor
in mortal kombat <num> <year> liu kang and his friends fight against shao kahn 's extermination squad which invaded earthrealm
he once again defeats shao kahn causing him and his forces to retreat back to outworld
in the events of mortal kombat <num> <year> liu kang discovers that his lover and ally princess kitana has been captured by the disgraced elder god shinnok 's forces and begins gathering earth 's warriors to defeat him
liu kang confronts shinnok and once again emerges victorious with kitana and her people having survived to the attack but he is unable to commit himself to a relationship due to his duty as earthrealm 's champion while kitana has to remain in outworld to rule her kingdom
liu kang becomes unplayable for the first and only time in the mortal kombat series in <year> 's mortal kombat deadly alliance in which the titular partnership of shang tsung and fellow sorcerer quan chi join forces to kill him in the game 's introductory sequence
in the events of mortal kombat deception <year> an unknown party reanimates liu kang 's corpse and sends it on a murderous rampage causing liu kang 's soul to attempt to control it
he returns as a playable character in this game albeit in undead form and as a secret character that can only be unlocked by completing the game 's konquest mode
his spirit enlists the reformed ninja ermac to try to save kitana and his earthrealm allies — johnny cage jax sonya and kung lao — who had all been killed by the deadly alliance and then resurrected by the dragon king onaga for use as his slaves
though they successfully accomplish this task liu kang is still unable to fully regain control of his body in mortal kombat armageddon <year> where he is playable along with the entire series roster and in which it is revealed that raiden had revived liu kang 's corpse in deception
liu kang 's bond with kitana had succeeded in keeping his power in check with nightwolf then assuming her position as liu kang 's spiritual anchor in attempt to find a way to reunite his body and soul which he accomplishes in his ending
liu kang was among the many characters who were not given a biography for armageddon while in his own noncanonical in @-@ game ending his body and soul reunite on their own before he confronts raiden and defeats him in combat to become earthrealm 's new protector
along with kung lao liu kang is the lead character in the <year> spinoff action @-@ adventure game mortal kombat shaolin monks
the game is a retelling of the storyline of the events leading up to mortal kombat ii and features the two shaolin monks traveling to outworld to find and defeat shang tsung later ending in a fight with shao kahn and rescuing kitana along the way
he is among the eleven characters representing the mortal kombat franchise in the <year> crossover title mortal kombat vs
dc universe which features fights between characters from the mortal kombat and the dc comics universes
in this game liu kang appears as the protagonist of the first chapter of the mortal kombat story mode
tobias said that the fight he expected to see in the game was between liu kang and batman as he noted their back @-@ stories to be very similar due to fact both liu kang and batman are fought in raiden and superman 's chapters respectively trying to snap their rage influenced respective leaders back to their sense from killing the leader 's respective arch @-@ enemies lex luthor and shang tsung reminding them that dark kahn is their true enemy
in the <year> mortal kombat reboot video game liu kang reprises his role from the first three tournaments as one of raiden 's chosen warriors
raiden who has visions from the future in which shao kahn remained as the last warrior believes that liu kang is the warrior which his future self chose as the savior
as in the first game liu kang succeeds in defeating goro and shang tsung though raiden 's amulet continues to crack unchanging the future
during the second tournament liu kang meets kitana and the two engage romantically with each other in this timeline too
it is during this tournament that kang begins to doubt raiden 's visions after he ordered him and kung lao not to rescue kitana and when lao is killed by shao kahn
he seemingly kills shao kahn and avenges his fallen friend
however kahn survives and begins plotting to invade earthrealm
when shao kahn is preparing to invade earthrealm during the third game 's events liu kang is among earthrealm 's protectors and notices raiden 's futile attempts to alter the future
he and raiden visit the elder gods in order to put a stop to kahn 's plan but refuse to intervene stating that kahn 's invasion is not a violation of mortal kombat but the merging of earthrealm and outworld is
when they return nearly all of their allies are dead murdered by a soul @-@ infused sindel and liu kang rushes to kitana only for her to die in his arms
this coupled with raiden 's failed attempts in changing the future and his plan to form an alliance with the netherrealm causes kang to deem raiden insane and decides to take on shao kahn alone
he arrives as kahn enters earthrealm but raiden attempts to stops him as he realized kahn had to win and merge the realms in order to avoid the events of the future
having enough of raiden 's continued mistakes the two fight but kang is defeated
as he attempts to shoot a fireball at raiden the thunder god uses his lightning to protect him inadvertently electrocuting liu kang much to raiden 's horror
rushing to his burnt body raiden pleads for his forgiveness but kang coldly says to the thunder god you
have killed us
all
and dies
after raiden defeats shao kahn with the help of the elder gods and thus changing the future he and the surviving warriors johnny cage and sonya blade leave and begin the restoration of earthrealm and he takes kang 's body with him
liu kang returns in mortal kombat x
in the game 's story mode he was resurrected by quan chi and now serves him as one of the revenants until sub @-@ zero scorpion and jax are revived
he fights both jax and raiden in story mode which he blames raiden for his death
at the end of the story mode he and kitana become the new rulers of the netherrealm due to quan chi 's death and shinnok 's defeat
a now darker raiden brings them shinnok 's disembodied head as a warning for them not to attack earthrealm
according to tobias liu kang was originally going to be a traditional monk – bald and in robes – but he wound up resembling bruce lee
as stated on his mortal kombat armageddon bio card ed boon mentioned that liu kang was designed to be the most easily accessible character meaning that both casual and experienced gamers could play as him with little difficulty
according to tobias liu kang was purposely the only character that voiced his finishing move in the original game and was the best in the first sequel
liu kang was the only character in the first game whose finishing move fatality did not explicitly murder his opponent and also without the background dimming
this was because liu kang was depicted therein as a shaolin monk who in general have strict beliefs regarding killing and murder
however starting with mortal kombat ii he was given gory fatalities as he was thereafter depicted as a renegade monk who decided to grow his hair back and who had strong shaolin beliefs but was no longer a part of the shaolin monks
in response to rumors that liu kang would die in mortal kombat ii and therefore not make it into mortal kombat <num> boon said it 'd be like doing part three of star wars and not having luke skywalker in there
you don 't do that
his eventual death caused dan forden the music composer of the series to make a funeral song for liu kang as he felt saddened for his death
the track titled liu kang 's tomb would be used in mortal kombat deception in the arena that shows his tomb
liu kang was played by ho sung pak in the first two games and john tobias stated in an interview that he originally intended for the character to be a traditional bald monk but the actor refused to shave his head
in the first game liu kang was modeled after bruce lee as he had short hair and went shirtless with a threadbare outfit of only black pants and white shoes
in mortal kombat ii his outfit was enhanced with red stripes and now included a red headband black shoes and studded wristguards the intro of mkii shows the younger version of the character defeating shang tsung in the background while the updated character is in the foreground
in mortal kombat <num> his hair was considerably longer with the only alteration to his outfit being thin black leg strips wrapped above his ankles in order to give him a sleeker look for the game
he was given a red tank top in addition to his usual costume in mortal kombat <num> but his alternate outfit was blue and featured him shirtless again
his wardrobe from the third game was carried over into deception and armageddon but due to his resurrection his skin was ash gray and he wore hooked chains around his wrists
this form is also known by fans and mortal kombat producer shaun himmerick as zombie liu kang
nevertheless his alternate outfit for both games featured him as a living person in order to contrast his undead form
in mortal kombat vs
dc universe he sported a slightly altered version of his third costume in addition to a championship belt adorned with the mortal kombat dragon emblem
although liu kang 's design in mortal kombat shaolin monks remains similar to his mortal kombat ii one himmerick said that it was the most revised one from the game along with kung lao 's
another such move is the bicycle kick in which liu kang flies across the screen with a series of multiple kicks to the opponent 's torso resembling pedaling a bicycle hence the name
a different kind of his signature abilities is the dragon fire with it liu kang sends a fiery flame in the shape of a chinese dragon across the screen out of his hands at his opponent
after mortal kombat ii he gains the ability to perform this while crouching and in the air same for deception and armageddon
the developers made liu kang immediately selectable in mortal kombat unchained the playstation portable port of deception as they noted that unlocking him in deception had proved difficult
liu kang 's first finishing move is the fatality shaolin uppercut he performs a butterfly kick often mistaken for a cartwheel on his opponent before hitting an uppercut that knocks them into the air for several seconds
in mortal kombat shaolin monks there were two versions one where the victim explodes to pieces upon impact and the original in which the opponent is torn to pieces upon falling to the ground
in another signature fatality he morphs into a large dragon chomping the upper body of his opponent
this fatality was turned into an animality in mortal kombat <num> and back into a normal fatality in mortal kombat <num>
in the game boy and game gear versions of mortal kombat ii the dragon torches the opponent with fire instead
the series composer and co @-@ designer john vogel noted it to be his favorite fatality due to how much liu kang 's appearance changes
another famous fatality of liu kang has him vanish and a mortal kombat arcade game machine drop down and crush his opponent
according to gamespy 's mk2011 walkthrough liu kang inflicts better damage than kung lao by jumping around like a lunatic and kicking the crap out of everything he sees
in the first miniseries blood and thunder his backstory was mostly kept intact as a shaolin monk out to restore the tournament to their righteous owners with the only difference being that he was not the chosen one to defeat goro which instead fell on twin monk brothers named sing and sang two original characters created specifically for the comics after they are killed by goro in the third issue liu kang becomes the shaolin 's only hope in defeating shang tsung
the following miniseries battlewave stated that liu kang won the first tournament after defeating goro which never appeared in the first miniseries
he returns to his normal life as an architect in chicago having left the order of light before the events of the first series
however he suffers from constant attacks by an unknown force of ninjas and later receives help from johnny cage 's bodyguard bo when goro ambushes him in an office building
eventually he decides to travel to outworld realizing that he cannot avoid mortal kombat
liu kang is the primary hero of both mortal kombat movies where he is portrayed by robin shou
director paul w
s
anderson wanted liu kang 's character to be really engaging and chose shou noting his skills with martial arts
in the first film he takes part in the tournament out of guilt over his brother 's death at the hands of shang tsung portrayed by cary @-@ hiroyuki tagawa and defeats tsung in the final battle
as a result of the film 's style the relationship between liu kang and kitana is more of a metaphysical than a romantic nature
shou along with talisa soto kitana was one of only two actors to reprise their roles in the sequel mortal kombat annihilation keith cooke who played reptile returned as well but as the new sub @-@ zero
in the sequel liu kang joins the earthrealm warriors to stop shao kahn 's menace
in the animated film mortal kombat the journey begins serving as a prequel to the first film liu kang appears as one of the main characters
liu kang is also one of the lead characters in the <year> animated series mortal kombat defenders of the realm voiced by brian tochi
he is not the protagonist therein as opposed to the game storyline instead sharing this role with several other earthrealm heroes
liu kang appears in the <year> 's second season of the web series mortal kombat legacy portrayed by brian tee
liu kang in legacy is portrayed as an anti @-@ hero and fighting on the side of outworld rather than that of earthrealm in the web series
in this version he is shown to have left a monastery to live a normal life working at a diner with a fiancée
after watching a pair of thieves kill her in a robbery attempt he becomes consumed with anger and revenge and further distances himself from kung lao and the ideals that were taught to him
after working as a freelance assassin for a few years he is approached by shang tsung who convinces him that humanity is not worth protecting and asks him to join the realm of outworld in the upcoming mortal kombat tournament which he agrees to
during the tournament he easily subdues johnny cage and kurtis stryker before being confronted by kung lao who is surprised at his old friend 's change of allegiance
in <year> toy island published a liu kang action figure which had a white shirt
two liu kang action figures from shaolin monks were released by jazwares
apart from being flexible both figures included different types of weapons such as swords and axes
his relation with kitana was ranked fourth in ign 's list of best video game couples in <year>
gamespot featured him in their <year> poll for the title of all time greatest game hero in which he lost to yoshi
ugo networks ranked him as <num> on the <year> list of top heroes of all time noting his role in the mortal kombat series as well as character depth
in <year> gamesradar ranked him as 51st most memorable influential and badass protagonist in games adding that while sub @-@ zero and scorpion may get most of the fanfare liu kang can shoot fireballs whoops and hollers just like bruce lee and pioneered the animality with his dragon @-@ transformation fatality--it ’ s no wonder that liu kang ’ s the chosen champion of earthrealm
in <year> jack pooley of what culture ranked him as the second greatest ever fighting game character
like all the characters from mortal kombat vs
dc universe liu kang was selected to be a playable character based on his popularity
jesse schedeen of ign said that it just wouldn 't be right having a game without liu kang noting him to be as fierce as the dc universe characters in this game
in <year> gameplaybook ranked liu kang as the second best mortal kombat character commenting that his nimbleness and fighting expertise make him an ideal pick and how he is as good as zombie as when he was alive
in <year> bright hub ranked liu kang as the second best character in the series
in ugo 's <year> list of top mortal kombat characters liu kang was given first place
in <year> he was ranked as the fifth @-@ top mortal kombat character by jon hamlin of the game scouts for his popularity and being incredibly important to the mortal kombat universe
that same year the readers of dorkly voted him the series sixth greatest character
upon his death in deadly alliance ign 's jeremy dunham noted that liu kang was killed as the series needed starting over mentality as he regarded liu kang as the series strongest character
complex remarked that the mortal kombat developers finally found their groove again with deadly alliance which began by snapping liu kang 's neck
game informer listed his death in their article about characters that died under our watch calling it a shock as liu kang was stated to be one of the most loved characters from the series
his redesign in mortal kombat deception was praised by gamespot for being one of the best ones from the title and was featured in gamesradar 's list of the greatest zombie triumphs in <year> but was also ranked as the ninth @-@ worst mortal kombat character by screwattack in <year>
additionally gamesradar used liu kang as an example of a stereotype of gaming heroes who reveal an evil alter ego that ruins the character 's appealing traits and considered him to be a little like the shaolin version of goku in that he 's saved his world countless times and come back from the dead even more frequently
gamesradar featured him the article about kickass bruce lee clones citing his similarities with bruce lee and with one of his shouts featured in famous quotes
liu kang 's dragon fatality has also been listed as one of the best fatalities from the series by both game informer and ugo in <year> as well as by complex in <year>
on the other hand his fatality in which he throws a mortal kombat arcade were pointed by both game informer and gamepro as one of the worst from the series even as gamesradar listed it among the reasons of liu kang being boss
some video game publications criticized his gameplay and shouts while others noted him to be entertaining
ign 's douglas perry wrote that he preferred liu kang over kung lao as a playable character in shaolin monks because of his intuitive fighting moves adding that his shouts were annoying yet strangely pleasing
gamedaily also complained about his voice saying that liu kang screams out like a chicken and gamesradar wrote that the strange squeals he emits during his trademark bicycle kick move are unforgettable
the unusual spores led to the species being named the type species of the now @-@ abandoned genus astrosporina recent studies have shown that such a genus could not exist as the species with the defining traits do not form a monophyletic group
however it is a part of several clades within the genus inocybe
i
praetervisa grows on the ground in woodland favouring beech trees and can be found in europe north america and asia
it is inedible and probably poisonous due to the presence of muscarine
the ingestion of muscarine can lead to sludge syndrome and could potentially lead to death due to respiratory failure
the species was moved to the genus astrosporina by joseph schröter in <year> but this was rejected and the name astrosporina praetervisa is now considered an obligate synonym
astrosporina praetervisa was the type species of the no longer recognised genus
the specific epithet praetervisa comes from the latin word meaning overlooked
within the genus inocybe i
praetervisa has been placed in the subgenus inocybe
mycologist rolf singer places the species in the section marginatae mycologist thom kuyper considers marginatae a supersection and includes i
praetervisa along with i
abietis i
calospora and i
godeyi
phylogenetics has shown that in addition to the large clade of subgenus inocybe i
praetervisa forms a clade with i
calospora i
lanuginosa and i
leptophylla
the species are similar in that all four have basidiospores with small nodules it was this feature that defined the genus astrosporina with then a
praetervisa as its type species
however when phylogenetic analysis later concluded that nodulose @-@ spored inocybe species do not form a monophyletic group the name astrosporina was deemed inappropriate at a generic level
but it may be considered useful at a lower level to refer to the clade of the four inocybe species
of those four i
praetervisa is most closely related to i
calospora with which it forms a smaller and closer clade
a different study also found the close relationship between i
praetervisa and i
calospora it also named i
teraturgus as a part of the clade containing i
praetervisa i
calospora i
lanuginosa and i
leptophylla

it typically favours beech

it can be found in europe asia and north america
mycologist roger phillips describes its edibility as suspect recommending that it be avoided and notes that it is possible that the species is poisonous most species of inocybe have been shown to contain poisonous chemicals
mycologist ian robert hall lists the mushroom as containing the poisonous compound muscarine
consumption of muscarine could lead to a number of physiological effects including excess salivation lacrimation uncontrollable urination and defecation gastrointestinal problems and emesis vomiting this array of symptoms is also known by the acronym sludge
other potential effects include a drop in blood pressure sweating and death due to respiratory failure
after inheriting her father 's fortune in <year> she became the richest woman in britain
during the final quarter of the <num> century her husband the earl of rosebery was one of the most celebrated figures in britain an influential millionaire and politician whose charm wit charisma and public popularity gave him such standing that he almost eclipsed royalty
yet his jewish wife during her lifetime regarded as dull overweight and lacking in beauty remains an enigmatic figure largely ignored by historians and often regarded as notable only for financing her husband 's three ambitions to marry an heiress win the epsom derby and become prime minister the second and third of these possibly apocryphal ambitions were achieved after her death
in truth she was her husband 's driving force and motivation
her marriage into the aristocracy while controversial at the time gave her the social cachet in an antisemitic society that her vast fortune could not
she subsequently became a political hostess and philanthropist
her charitable work was principally in the sphere of public health and causes associated with the welfare of working @-@ class jewish women living in the poorer districts of london
having firmly assisted and supported her husband on his path to political greatness she suddenly died in <year> aged <num> leaving him distraught and bereft of her support to achieve the political destiny which she had plotted
his premiership of the united kingdom was shambolic and lasted barely a year
for over thirty years following her death he wandered in a political wilderness directionless and exceedingly eccentric until his own death in <year>
she was the granddaughter of baron nathan mayer rothschild who had founded n m rothschild sons the english branch of the rothschilds banking empire
niall ferguson states in his history of the house of rothschild that by the mid @-@ <num> century the rothschilds regarded themselves as the nearest thing the jews of europe had to a royal family and the equals of royalty
whether or not this was strictly true the many rothschild homes and their art collections in england austria france and germany certainly rivalled those of the crowned heads of europe
hannah de rothschild 's father baron meyer amschel de rothschild married his cousin juliana cohen in <year>
the marriage provided the impetus for meyer to create what he described as an enduring monument a country house of monumental proportions
his daughter hannah aged just six months laid the foundation stone on <num> december <year>
throughout her life mentmore towers was to be a fixed and pivotal point
within a few years of the mansion 's completion attracted by the good hunting and proximity to london hannah 's relatives began to build estates nearby all within a carriage drive of each other thus hannah grew up in an almost private world of unimaginable splendour and security
pevsner has described this enclave of rothschild properties as the most conspicuous and significant aspect of victorian architecture in buckinghamshire
in addition to mentmore baron and baroness meyer de rothschild had a large house in london <num> piccadilly the zenaide a luxurious yacht moored in the south of france and other smaller properties visited only seasonally and occasionally
as an only child growing up in what were in all but name palaces her childhood appears to have been quite lonely
she was a companion to her hypochondriac mother and in later life a hostess with her father during her mother 's long periods of indisposition
she was indulged by both parents and her formal education was neglected in favour of music and singing lessons subjects in which she was accomplished
her parents were very protective of her attempting to ensure that she was never exposed to the risk of sickness or even the sight of poverty
as a result she was never allowed to enter the cottages on the rothschilds estates
a cousin who seems to have disliked her claims that hannah was so sheltered that the phrase the poor was just a meaningless euphemism to her
this is likely to be an exaggeration as from her teens onwards she used much of her fortune to improve the lot of the poor in housing and education
whatever the faults of her education she possessed great confidence impressing her rothschild relations who noted her poise and competence when she hosted a large house party at mentmore for the prince of wales while only <num> years of age
mayer amschel de rothschild died in <year> leaving his daughter not only mentmore with its priceless art collection his london mansion and innumerable investments but also the sum of two million pounds sterling in cash equivalent to £ <num> million in present day terms
thus hannah de rothschild became the wealthiest woman in england
the disraelis were close friends and neighbours of the rothschilds in buckinghamshire
archibald <num> earl of rosebery born in <year> had inherited his title from his grandfather in <year> when aged <num> together with an income of £ <num> @,@ <num> a year
he owned <num> @,@ <num> acres <num> km <num> in scotland and land in norfolk hertfordshire and kent
his father had died when he was eight and he had been brought up by his mother who had subsequently married harry powlett <num> duke of cleveland
his mother was a distant figure and their relationship was always strained
the earls of rosebery whose family name was primrose were old if undistinguished members of the scottish aristocracy
rosebery was considered to be strikingly handsome and immensely cultivated
he was highly intelligent and a brilliant future was forecast for him by his tutors at both eton and christ church oxford
as early as <year> there were rumours of an engagement
however several hurdles had to be overcome before a marriage could take place
while the jewish rothschilds were accepted into society and indeed were close friends of some members of the royal family including the prince of wales as elsewhere in europe antisemitic feelings were prevalent in the upper echelons of society and particularly so among those closest to the queen at court where following the death of the prince consort in <year> the rothschilds became pointedly excluded
the queens equerry arthur edward hardinge referred to the rothschild 's dining tables as resplendent with the hebrew gold going so far as to say a visiting russian royal needed a corrective visit to westminster abbey following acceptance of rothschild hospitality
queen victoria herself expressed antisemitic views in <year> when it was proposed that lionel de rothschild be elevated to the peerage the queen refused and expressed a reluctance to make a jew a peer – saying to make a jew a peer is a step she could not consent to and furthermore stated to give a title and mark of her approbation to a jew
lord spencer advised the prince and princess of wales against attending a rothschild ball with the words the prince ought only to visit those of undoubted position in society
however this did not prevent the prince from accepting rothschild 's invitations and gifts privately
while one could be friends with jews and accept their hospitality their social status was still not sufficiently elevated to include marriage into the peerage without unfavourable comment
rosebery 's own mother was horrified at the thought of a jewess even a rothschild in the family
rosebery too felt there was an impassable barrier of faith at this time it was inconceivable that any children could be reared as jews
although it has been stated that rosebery himself was devoid of any antisemitic views this was not always true especially in later life
this factor also worked in reverse while hannah de rothschild was keen to marry rosebery she was also aware of many obstacles the foremost being that she was devoted to her faith and to leave it would be a severe moral wrench
another obstacle was the rothschild family itself it was their custom to marry cousins to keep their fortune within the family
ironically hannah herself had opposed the marriage of her cousin annie de rothschild to the christian eliot yorke the son of the earl of hardwicke in <year>
in fact she was to be the third daughter of the family 's english branch to marry outside of the jewish faith but such was the fame of the bridegroom and the resultant publicity that the jewish elders and press felt an example needed to be made
the jewish chronicle announced its most poignant grief at the prospect and cryptically added if the flame seize on the cedars how will fare the hyssop on the wall if the leviathan is brought up with a hook how will the minnows escape demonstrating what a threat to the social fabric of the jewish faith the jewish elders saw in the prospect of such a marriage
the quotation originally from the babylonian talmud can be taken to mean that the elders and respected members and more notable members of the jewish faith should set a good example by strictly following the teachings of the jewish articles of faith which frown upon marriage to members of other religions
the formal engagement of marriage was announced on <num> january <year> a day rosebery forever afterwards regarded as sacred
writing to a friend in january <year> rosebery described his wife as very simple very unspoilt very clever very warm @-@ hearted and very shy
i never knew such a beautiful character
the marriage was celebrated in london on <num> march <year> at the board room of guardians in mount street and also in a christian ceremony at christ church in down street piccadilly
to show official disapproval no male member of the rothschild family attended the ceremonies
however any shortcomings in the guest list were compensated for by the guest of honour — the prince of wales — and disraeli who gave the bride away
however as the couple 's social and political interests increased from <year> they leased the larger lansdowne house
lansdowne house was one of the finest of the aristocratic palaces in london well suited to be the home of the political salon which hannah rosebery was to establish
here political and social leaders of the day mixed with royalty authors such as henry james and oscar wilde and other prominent social and intellectual figures of the time
henry james an occasional guest in the roseberys homes delivered one of the most unflattering condemnations of lady rosebery describing her as
large coarse hebrew @-@ looking with hair of no particular colour and personally unattractive
the roseberys divided their year among their various homes london for the social season and parliament mentmore at weekends to entertain both political and shooting house @-@ parties
in august the household would move north to dalmeny for the grouse shooting
in between occasional days and the weeklong derby meeting would be spent at their home the durdans in epsom
though small by comparison to their other homes this mansion was described by henry james as the most homely and comfortable of the roseberys many homes and as a delightful house full of books and sporting pictures with just a few gainsboroughs and watteaux
together the earl and countess of rosebery added greatly to not only the mentmore collection but also to that housed at dalmeny house rosebery 's scottish seat amassing a great library of rare and continental volumes and a collection of artefacts formerly belonging to the emperor napoleon i
however much evidence suggests that rosebery while professing to be happy was at times irritated and bored by hannah who was always keen to accommodate his every whim
there were times when lady rosebery 's devotion to her husband was tested
rosebery may have not been antisemitic before his marriage however the acerbic wit for which he was famous led him to make remarks that could have been taken in such a way once his marriage had secured the rothschild fortune
rosebery seems to have disliked his first son who he claimed looked jewish
on seeing his son for the first time he remarked le jew est fait rien ne vas plus which must have been disconcerting for the child 's very jewish mother
rosebery who has been described as febrile and supercilious replied in a letter of congratulations on the birth of his heir from mary gladstone i cannot pretend to be much excited by an event which occurs to almost every human being and which may cause me a great deal of annoyance
rosebery then left his newborn child and wife who was again pregnant for a year @-@ long tour of australia
on another occasion when the roseberys were travelling in india rosebery is reported to have announced i will travel ahead hannah and the rest of the heavy baggage will follow the next day
while the marriage was based on warmth and esteem on rosebery 's side and adoration on hannah 's it seems that rosebery often found his wife 's devotion irritating and this sometimes caused him to be impatient with her
he was often abrupt with her in public
she by contrast was completely enraptured by him and would frequently ignore her neighbours at a dinner party to listen to her husband 's conversation further down the table a faux pas almost considered a crime in victorian society
those who saw the couple alone at home could not doubt the affection as well as the comprehension that united them
however at times rosebery 's behaviour could be eccentric
gladstone remarked that rosebery was perhaps rather too concerned with his health
early in the marriage rosebery decided to renovate the small ruined barnbougle castle the original rosebery family seat close to and within sight of dalmeny house
once renovation was complete in <year> rosebery used it as a private retreat from his family and began to spend his nights there alone
always an insomniac he claimed that the stillness of the waters the nearby firth of forth were conducive to sleep
books were his passion and he assembled a huge library in the small castle
thus rosebery was able to lead a life at dalmeny with his wife but also quite apart from her
during their marriage the roseberys travelled extensively usually without their children
in september <year> the couple left their children in the care of the nannies and nursery maids supervised by rosebery 's sister lady leconfield for a long tour of america and australia
lady rosebery owned large investments in north america including ranches in texas and mines in montana
their arrival in new york was widely reported and a full and flattering description of lady rosebery was reported in the herald
the newspaper went on to describe rosebery as looking like a prosperous farmer
lady rosebery was very taken with california from where she wrote the inhabitants are very entertaining
the women are very handsome think nothing of dresses costing £ <num> fix up their faces very frequently and are generally divorced
having toured and been fêted in america the party moved on to australia via honolulu
in australia rosebery chose to indulge his habit of solitude installing his wife in a hotel in sydney while he went off alone to tour the outback
rosebery 's frequent absences from his wife fuelled gossip that he was a secret homosexual
it has been claimed that the inscrutable air that rosebery wore was a mask to disguise his secret homosexual life
the worry of this illegal secret it was claimed and fear of exposure caused his insomnia and bouts of depression
it was even whispered that his barnbougle castle retreat was really a venue for clandestine assignations with young men
rosebery 's possible homosexuality has been much discussed in recent times
nothing conclusive has ever been found one way or the other but it is possible that he had homosexual experiences while in the care of a paedophile housemaster at eton in his youth
no evidence exists that his wife was aware of these rumours against her husband or even that she would have understood them bearing in mind her sheltered upbringing and limited education
sex education was not part of a <num> @-@ century upper @-@ class girl 's schooling
the more public and precise accusations of rosebery 's homosexuality by the marquess of queensberry did not occur until three years after lady rosebery 's death
the relationship between the couple appears at times to have been almost that of a mother and child
rosebery a self @-@ centred reserved man prone to depression pessimism and insecurity had a difficult relationship with his mother who had been distant and openly preferred his younger brother
lady rosebery an orphan and only child appears to have been desperate to lavish affection
once upon entering a book shop she told her children they were entering a toy shop and when the disappointed children pointed out the obvious she replied to your father this is a toy shop
lord rosebery 's friend edward hamilton recorded her notable faculty of getting other people to work and quickening their energies
it seems she was the driving force of the relationship with her feet firmly on the ground
she made herself the link between the world and her thin skinned and neurotic husband
while her husband sulked or withdrew with hurt pride from a situation she came to the forefront to plead his case or cause
if she was aware of his faults she gave no indication of it
as a mother lady rosebery was presented with a dilemma she was in fact already practically a mother to her husband who had no great feeling for a proximity to small babies
this was particularly evident in june <year> when shortly after the birth of their first child sybil rosebery wished to visit germany for three months to take a cure at a german spa he was recovering from what is now thought to have been a nervous breakdown
his wife dutifully accompanied him
however rosebery clearly aware of his wife 's frustrated maternal instincts reported that hannah savoured every detail of the daily letters from london concerning the baby and that she never complained at the forced separation
more revealing is a comment lady rosebery herself made to her husband i sometimes think it is wrong that i have thought less of the children in comparison to you shortly before her death in <year> suggesting that when a choice between her children and husband was forced on her she always chose her husband
however the same comment also hints that she was not unaware that her choice was at the cost of her children
when assessing lady rosebery 's behaviour to her children it should be remembered that she lived in an era of plentiful nannies wet nurses nursemaids and governesses which the upper classes employed as the norm
these people were employed regardless of the mother 's affection towards her children it was inconceivable that a countess would nurse her own children and to do so would have been breaking social conventions
hence her seeming lack of attention to her children was not unusual – she was following the upper class conventions and stiff upper lip philosophies of her era
however in spite of their prolonged absences from their children the roseberys do not appear to have been very distant or remote figures in the earliest stages of their children 's lives
margot asquith records how rosebery loved to play and romp on the floor with the children
this gave her confidence and the experience to be the perfect political wife
marriage to her altered rosebery 's status too while his wife acquired christian respectability and a title rosebery moved from being one of many wealthy and capable young noblemen to being one with unfathomable riches
this coupled with his good looks appealed to the public 's imagination and gave him glamour
from the outset of the marriage political members of the rothschild family took an interest in rosebery and he was soon acclaimed as one of the rising hopes of the liberal party
as a hereditary peer he already had a seat in the house of lords and had made his maiden speech there on attaining his majority
but brilliant as he was rosebery tended to lethargy and boredom
lord granville in fact considered rosebery 's wife to be the more ambitious of the pair and even advised her if you keep him up to the mark he is sure to have his page in history
the subtle driving of her often languid and lethargic husband to achieve his page in history was to become her raison d 'être
rosebery 's secretary thomas gilmour noted she is thoroughly genuine and very tender and devoted to lord rosebery it is easy to see that she is very proud of him and she is a woman of considerable force of character and great energy she may prove to be a powerful ally in his political career
rosebery was not a natural politician
he was an idealist who disliked the rancour of politics in fact his innate dislike of politics was something lady rosebery always fought against
however he was a gifted orator and this was an era when platform speaking was beginning to replace house of commons debate
on a tour of america before his marriage rosebery had been impressed by the campaigning of prospective political candidates in britain little had changed in that respect since the hustings of the <num> century
he realised how an electorate could be swayed by a candidate touring his prospective constituency aided by a well thought @-@ out series of events rallies and advertising with the candidate 's ideal and attractive family smiling by his side
thus lady rosebery not only pushed and encouraged him behind the scenes but was now to become an encouraging and conspicuous figure by his side
in this way it could be said she was the first openly political wife in britain
this first became evident in the great campaign to re @-@ elect gladstone
known today as the midlothian campaign it was masterminded by the roseberys
rosebery used his influence to have gladstone invited to stand as parliamentary candidate for midlothian near to rosebery 's dalmeny estate
gladstone had nominally retired from politics after losing his greenwich seat in <year> when disraeli had been swept to power
the campaign was based at dalmeny where lady rosebery hosted a series of large political house parties throughout the long campaign
the tories were later to claim that rosebery had paid for gladstone 's campaign
rosebery later admitted to spending £ <num> @,@ <num>
the roseberys house party would leave dalmeny and tour towns and cities across midlothian and scotland with gladstone and the speakers often addressing vast crowds from the back of an american @-@ designed pullman car specially acquired by rosebery for the purpose
the scenes at these meetings have been described as something between a carnival and an evangelist 's revival meeting
while in the grounds of dalmeny house itself the public were treated to a great firework display
throughout all this gladstone was supported not only by the popular and charismatic rosebery but also by an array of well @-@ dressed women including lady rosebery and gladstone 's daughter mary
these fashionable people – the celebrities of their day newspapers at the time gave many column inches each day to the doings of the upper classes – were as much a crowd @-@ puller as the political speakers and rosebery 's planning used that to full effect
one meeting was so packed that many were fainting <num> @,@ <num> people applied for tickets in a hall capable of holding <num> @,@ <num>
lady rosebery reported i had never heard archie lord rosebery speak in public politically before but after the first minute i felt i could never be nervous at his making a speech the audience show him great affection
sic however it was not just gladstone and rosebery the huge crowds had come to see but also the dutifully supporting and smiling families
lady rosebery went on to describe how they the crowds patted me on the back till my shoulders were sensitive
thus in rosebery 's first serious involvement in politics disraeli was defeated and the newly elected mp for midlothian became prime minister for the second time the caretaker liberal leader lord hartington retired in favour of gladstone
it was also obvious that lady rosebery was a very evident and valuable political electioneering asset
as the marquess of crewe put it she had cut her spurs
her political mettle and ambitions for her husband were however to be more severely tested following the liberal victory
rosebery was as expected offered a position in government by gladstone
it had been rumoured that the position of viceroy of ireland or a cabinet place would be proffered but it turned out to be the job of under secretary of the india office
rosebery immediately declined the post giving as his reason that it would appear that he was being repaid for running gladstone 's campaign as though the viceregal position would not
when pressed further he cited ill health — he had been suffering from scarlet fever during the midlothian campaign and now also appeared to be suffering a minor nervous breakdown
political leaders urged lady rosebery to influence him but she defended his decision while stressing that his deterioration in health was only temporary
she had to be careful — if it appeared her husband had declined the offer on the grounds that it was too lowly it would give substance to the claims being made that he was conceited and petulant
whatever the truth and it may be rosebery 's own explanation that he disliked hard work lady rosebery continued to solicit gladstone for a job for rosebery within the cabinet
in august <year> when gladstone told her firmly that there is nothing i can give him she claimed she had not been seeking a cabinet post and gladstone had misunderstood her
at the same time she was canny enough to mention that sir william harcourt and sir charles dilke both radicals opposed to gladstone 's policies were visiting them and thoughtful
lady rosebery also began to befriend those politicians such as lord northbrook who empathised with her husband while others such as lord granville and lord hartington she identified as aloof
she dismissed lord spencer with i can never look on him as a great motive power besides he does not mention archie rosebery to me
this was the same lord spencer who had advised the prince and princess of wales against visiting the homes of wealthy jews
finally her soliciting paid off and in <year> rosebery was offered a government position acceptable to him that of under secretary at the home office with special responsibility for scotland
he had sought the position feeling that scotland was neglected by the liberal government who were more interested in ireland
however immediately upon assuming the job he began to demand a place in the cabinet
the office he sought was that of lord privy seal a position gladstone refused on account of rosebery 's inexperience in government
it appeared that rosebery was showing his true colours and he was accused of behaving like a spoilt child with doubts cast over the honourableness of his reasons for refusing the under secretaryship of the india office
lady rosebery conscious of her husband 's supreme ability wanted him in the cabinet and was furiously agitating her husband 's discontent until rosebery threatened to resign his home office position
lady rosebery had an angry row with gladstone 's wife where mrs gladstone pointed out that if rosebery resigned he would have nothing but horse racing to interest him and that lady rosebery should be patient as her husband was young
rosebery accepting that a cabinet place was not going to be forthcoming resigned from government
lady rosebery realising further appeal to the gladstones was pointless tried a new avenue — lord hartington the immensely influential secretary of state for war who was already quarrelling with gladstone over the irish home rule problem and whom she allegedly met by chance at preston railway station
inviting him into her carriage for the journey to london she pleaded her husband 's case for three hours to her captive listener
the roseberys then immediately left england and their children for a long trip to america and australia
on their return in <year> rosebery was appointed lord privy seal complete with the seat in the cabinet which he sought
gladstone resigned as prime minister in <year> following a government defeat over the irish home rule question
the new tory government was led by lord salisbury
however as a minority administration it was not expected to last and a swift return of the former administration was anticipated
during this period serious if unproven charges of plotting and ruthless ambition were about to be levelled against lady rosebery
sir charles dilke considered as a likely replacement for gladstone and thus a rival to rosebery in government was implicated in one of the most scandalous and ruinous divorce cases of the era
involvement in any divorce was social suicide in the <num> century but the facts which emerged were enough to ensure it was political suicide as well
a friend of the roseberys donald crawford mp sued his wife virginia for divorce naming dilke as co @-@ respondent
there was little evidence and dilke denied the charge which could have been ultimately forgotten if virginia had not suddenly decided to sign a confession giving such lurid details that a great scandal was unavoidable
she claimed that not only had dilke slept with her and taught her french vices but also slept with her mother and partaken in a three @-@ in @-@ a @-@ bed orgy with virginia and a maid
dilke denied everything but his hopes of high political office were ruined forever
dilke claimed the whole thing was an embroidery of lies and conspiracies by his political enemies
rumours began to circulate that the roseberys and lady rosebery in particular were at the bottom of dilke 's misfortune
in his futile quest to exonerate himself and grasping at rumour dilke wrote to rosebery accusing lady rosebery of having paid virginia to make the confession
an outraged rosebery denied all on his wife 's behalf while in december <year> lady rosebery 's only response on being told of virginia crawford 's confessions was dilke 's behaviour is very astonishing in some reports though it is not an actual surprise to me
early the following year gladstone was returned to power and rosebery was appointed foreign secretary in gladstone 's third but brief term of office
dilke 's political career was ruined and for years afterwards he continued to expound the rosebery conspiracy theory
nothing was ever proven against lady rosebery and no tangible evidence exists to substantiate the claim
the impartiality demanded by rosebery 's new office forced him to sell many of his business interests which had come by the way of the rothschild family to be seen to be avoiding a conflict of interest
however his wife 's ambition and part in his rise to power was not only being recognised in high places but clearly starting to irritate
on being told that lady rosebery was very keen for her husband to become foreign secretary gladstone replied she would think herself capable of being queen of the realm and think the place only just good enough for her
rosebery was now on the path to political greatness but gladstone 's government fell the same year
lady rosebery was not to see her husband achieve the highest political office
her chief causes appear to have all been connected specifically to the assistance and welfare of women
she was president of the scottish home industries association a charity which encouraged scottish women to work profitably from home making plaid or other items of needlework and the like
in this way women especially widowed mothers remained in their homes able to care for their often large families while still earning an income
queen victoria appointed her president of the queen victoria jubilee institute for nurses in scotland the beginning of the district nurse system which was to revolutionise health care for the rural poor and sick in britain
she was also interested in general improvements in standards of nursing
like many of her rothschild relatives she was also deeply involved with the welfare of young working @-@ class women of the jewish faith who inhabited the poorer areas of london in particular whitechapel
there she founded the club for jewish working girls
she also donated to numerous other charities connected with jewish causes
however within a week of her death her husband began to cancel many of these subscriptions prompting charges of antisemitism
her interest in education has been one of her most obvious surviving charitable legacies
she founded schools in all the villages surrounding the roseberys estates
the mentmore estate alone was serviced by three schools founded by her at wingrave cheddington and mentmore itself
not only were the children educated at her expense by trained teachers each was also provided with seasonal gifts of new clothes
cheddington school remains in its original building with her cypher on its walls while wingrave school which opened in <year> survives in new premises
one of her more pioneering and innovative charitable causes was the oral instruction of what were then called the deaf and dumb
she fought the disease but it was found that she was also suffering from bright 's disease which had weakened her making it impossible to survive the attack
she was buried in accordance with the rites of the jewish faith
rosebery found this particularly hard to bear and wrote to queen victoria of the pain he experienced when another creed steps in to claim the corpse
it was only after her death that the doctors who had treated her disclosed to rosebery that her kidney condition would have killed her within two years even if she had not contracted typhoid
her funeral was held on <num> november <year> at willesden jewish cemetery
as is the jewish tradition the service was attended only by male mourners who included most members of gladstone 's cabinet
there is no evidence that lady rosebery drove her husband to follow her own political agenda or that of her family
for her the rewards seem to have been the pleasure of seeing a husband she undoubtedly adored in the high office of which she felt him worthy
there is no doubt that she tempered her husband 's more radical views
immediately following his wife 's death rosebery retired from politics writing in october <year> the sole object of my ambition has disappeared with the death of my wife
proof of the widespread belief in society that lady rosebery was the stable element of the partnership was confirmed shortly after her death by queen victoria following a then rare public speech by rosebery in which he supported home rule for ireland
the queen was shocked and thought the speech almost communistic and went on to attribute rosebery 's shocking and disappointing behaviour to the fact that poor lady rosebery is not there to keep him back
while queen victoria always personally liked rosebery she mistrusted his politics
the queen had thoroughly liked lady rosebery and wrote rosebery several letters of condolence likening his loss to the untimely death of her own consort prince albert
it seems that the queen 's antipathy to jews was confined to elevating them to the peerage
this view had softened by <year>
in <year> she accepted a luncheon invitation from lady rosebery 's cousin ferdinand de rothschild and toured waddesdon manor albeit eating in a separate dining room to the jewish members of the party
shortly after his wife 's death rosebery left his grieving children and went alone on a tour of spain
following a visit to el escorial he wrote on the sepulchral wonders of the building but added for the dead alone the taj is of course supreme
on his return home he had designed for his wife a victorian gothic version of the taj mahal in miniature
for the remainder of his life he wore black and used black edged writing paper
once when talking with his daughter sybil he asked her what mourning she thought her mother would have worn had the situation been reversed
sybil replied she would not have worn any she would have died at once
ronald munro ferguson has been quoted in <year> as saying many things would have gone otherwise had lady rosebery lived
her loss is today as great a calamity from every point of view as it was at the time of her death
widowhood changed rosebery both mentally and physically he aged overnight and began to refer to himself as an old man
two years after her death friends were still concerned that he was suicidal
winston churchill thought him maimed by her death and later said of her she was a remarkable woman on whom rosebery leaned she was ever a pacifying and composing element in his life which he was never able to find again because he could never give full confidence to anyone else
sir edward hamilton rosebery 's closest friend wrote her qualities were portrayed in literature when lady rosebery was reputed to be the model for marcella maxwell in mrs humphry ward 's novels marcella <year> and sir george tressady <year>
the author lived at stocks close to lady rosebery 's home at mentmore and would certainly have known her while in the books marcella 's house is based on hampden house also in buckinghamshire
the liberals did not return to office until <year>
lord rosebery was eventually persuaded to enter government becoming once again foreign secretary serving under gladstone as prime minister
in <year> on gladstone 's retirement he achieved his wife 's ambitions and became prime minister but by then lady rosebery was dead
without her rosebery was a shadow of his former self taking huge doses of morphine to combat insomnia and nerves
his prime ministership lasted barely a year marred by problems and difficulties
for the remainder of his life and without his wife as queen victoria phrased it to hold him back he became more and more eccentric and controversial in his decisions
his final years were blighted by ill health and a self @-@ enforced seclusion in scotland
he died in <year>
before their marriage and his full @-@ time entry into politics rosebery 's future wife had written with extraordinary foresight and ambition to him i work only to help you if you are prime minister let me imitate montagu corry
corry had been disraeli 's influential private secretary on whom he had relied
rosebery only ever trusted his wife
without her to calm and order his life he was a neurotic wreck
lady rosebery 's eldest son harry who was less successful in politics than his father and brother distinguished himself by becoming captain of surrey county cricket club and owning two epsom derby @-@ winning horses
he succeeded his father as <num> earl of rosebery and died in <year>
margaret married her father 's old friend and biographer the marquess of crewe
such was still the fame of her parents that london traffic was brought to a standstill on her wedding day in <year>
lady crewe became one of the first women magistrates in britain she died in <year>
lady sybil has been summarised by one of her father 's biographers even more eccentric than her father she spent much of her time living in a caravan
neil the second of the roseberys sons entered politics and a promising future was foretold for him
however on the outbreak of world war i he joined the army and was killed leading a charge at gezer in <year>
of hannah rosebery 's homes the lease on lansdowne house was surrendered shortly before her death when the roseberys purchased <num> berkeley square
this property was transformed into one of london 's most luxurious town houses
however lady rosebery did not live to see the work completed
her son harry sold the house in <year> and it was demolished
a year later a bomb landed on the empty site during world war ii
the durdans was bequeathed to her daughter sybil in <year> and was sold together with its contents in <year>
lord and lady rosebery 's library there was given to the nation at this time
mentmore the grandest of the roseberys homes was sold by lady rosebery 's grandson the <num> earl of rosebery in <year> together with the rothschild art collection which lady rosebery had not only been intensely interested in but had enlarged considerably
she personally catalogued the collection and prophetically wrote in the preface in time to come when like all collections this will be dispersed and i hope this will be long after my death this book may be of value
her two @-@ volume work and the collection it described remained so unknown that save mentmore a group attempting to halt the sale of mentmore to keep the collection within britain failed largely due to widespread public ignorance of both house and collection
a few pieces of furniture and paintings were taken to dalmeny the only house to remain in the family where they are displayed today and three pictures including drouais madame de pompadour were purchased for the national gallery
the remainder of the collection was dispersed in a week @-@ long sale and is now scattered across the globe
a further sale of the continental library to which she had added was conducted in <year> at the aeolian hall london by sotheby 's
in june <year> christie 's auctioned a set of pearl and diamond jewels a tiara brooch and bracelet that were originally in lady rosebery 's ownership
today lady rosebery is a mere footnote in the long history of her husband 's family rather as consuelo vanderbilt is regarded in the spencer @-@ churchill family
her husband once one of the most celebrated figures in britain is a minor figure in british history
thus hannah countess of rosebery in her day celebrated in the worlds of politics philanthropy and high society is largely unknown and forgotten
originating from a disturbance in the intertropical convergence zone in late @-@ august uleki was identified as a tropical depression well to the southeast of hawaii on august <num>
steady organization ensued as it moved west becoming a tropical storm on august <num> and a hurricane on august <num>
rapid intensification took place thereafter and the storm reached its peak intensity on september <num> as a category <num> on the saffir – simpson hurricane wind scale
hurricane hunters investigating the cyclone found peak winds of <num> mph <num> km h and a barometric pressure of <num> mbar hpa <num>
<num> inhg
thereafter uleki stalled for two days to the southwest of hawaii resulting in heavy surf across the state
the dangerous swells killed two people on oahu
unfavorable environmental conditions caused weakening of the hurricane by september <num> as it resumed a west @-@ northwest course away from hawaii
conditions later became favorable and uleki acquired winds of <num> mph <num> mph on september <num> constituting its secondary peak
the hurricane crossed the international dateline on september <num> and was reclassified as typhoon
remaining well away from land the cyclone steadily weakened to a tropical storm by september <num>
gradually turning north and later east the degrading cyclone transitioned into an extratropical cyclone four days later and ultimately dissipated on september <num> near the international dateline
an area of low pressure subsequently developed within this disturbance and was designated as tropical depression one @-@ c at <num> <num> utc on august <num>
upon classification the depression was situated roughly <num> mi <num> @,@ <num> km southeast of the big island of hawaii and moving west @-@ northwest
steady intensification ensued over the following day with the system attaining gale @-@ force winds by <num> <num> utc on august <num> at which time it was assigned the name uleki
the storm later attained winds of <num> mph <num> km h on august <num> and was dubbed a hurricane as it passed <num> mi <num> km south of hilo
thereafter uleki underwent a sudden period of rapid intensification and achieved major hurricane status later that day
after reaching this strength uleki 's forward motion gradually lessened and eventually almost ceased altogether on september <num> as upper @-@ level steering currents collapsed
with the hurricane situated to the southwest of the hawaiian islands hurricane hunters conducted several weather reconnaissance missions into the storm
on september <num> they found maximum surface winds of <num> mph <num> km h and a minimum barometric pressure of <num> mbar hpa <num>
<num> inhg this corresponded to the peak intensity of uleki
at the time uleki displayed a well @-@ organized tight circulation
the hurricane meandered in the same general area over the next two days executing several small loops with a slight northward drift
during this time its circulation increased in coverage but became less @-@ organized as weakening ensued
increased wind shear and restricted outflow took their toll on the hurricane
the cyclone 's winds dropped to <num> mph <num> km h by <num> <num> utc on september <num> as it resumed its west @-@ northwest track under the influence of a subtropical ridge away from the hawaiian islands
uleki passed roughly halfway between johnston atoll and the french frigate shoals on september <num>
by september <num> the weakened trend halted and environmental conditions favored reintensification
as uleki neared the international dateline it regained winds of <num> mph <num> km h
at <num> <num> utc on september <num> the cphc transferred warning responsibility of uleki to the joint typhoon warning center jtwc and the storm was subsequently referred to as a typhoon
transfer of warnings occurred when the storm was at <num> ° w rather than at the dateline where the boundary between the central and west pacific basins exists for unknown reasons
three hours later uleki made its closest approach to midway atoll passing <num> mi <num> km to the south
shortly thereafter the system crossed the international dateline and the japan meteorological agency jma also began advising on the system
the jma estimated uleki to have had a pressure of <num> mb hpa <num>
<num> inhg at this time however this value was derived from satellite estimates rather than direct measurements
uleki maintained this strength through september <num> as it continued on its west @-@ northwest course
on that day the typhoon again entered a region of weak steering currents between two anticyclones within the subtropical ridge
a trough approaching from the west was forecast to prompt uleki to turn east however the typhoon maintained a general northwest motion in a stair @-@ stepped fashion
increasing wind shear and cooler air soon imparted weakening and uleki degraded to a tropical storm by september <num>
continued effects from shear stripped the cyclone of all deep convection and by september <num> only a band of cirrus clouds remained in association with uleki
the jtwc issued their final warning on the system at <num> <num> utc that day accordingly
the jma maintained the system as a tropical depression as the former typhoon began turning to the east
uleki later transitioned into an extratropical cyclone on september <num> as it accelerated to the east
the system dissipated the following day near the international dateline far from any major landmasses
high surf advisories were raised for all islands as well
following uleki 's turn to the west on september <num> the tropical storm watches were discontinued
the storm 's erratic movement proved to be troublesome for forecasters and they continuously warned residents to be cautious and alert should the storm double @-@ back to the state
on september <num> lifeguards at waikiki beach and ala moana beach rescued <num> people caught in <num> to <num> ft <num>
<num> to <num>
<num> m swells
further north in oahu two people drowned after being caught in rough waters
the storm moved roughly halfway between the french frigate shoals and johnston island on september <num> with no adverse effects in either region due to its weakened state
on september <num> the <num> residents of midway atoll and united states coast guard personnel stationed on kure atoll prepared for possible hurricane @-@ force winds from the storm
hurricane uleki ultimately passed <num> mi <num> km south of midway atoll and produced some coastal flooding from increased surf
some breaking waves spilled onto the runway at henderson field
the race was the fifth round of the <year> season and marked the forty @-@ sixth running of the spanish grand prix as a round of the formula one world championship

furthermore he stressed that verstappen 's move to red bull would tie him to the team for the foreseeable future
daniil kvyat meanwhile expressed surprise at the decision saying during thursday 's press conference that he was shocked by his demotion stressing that red bull did not give him a real explanation
following problems with his power unit in both the chinese and russian grand prix lewis hamilton received a redesigned mgu @-@ h unit in a bid to solve the troubles which hampered him earlier
however mercedes was unable to guarantee that the problem would not appear again
with spain being the first race in western europe and a mid @-@ season test coming up after the race many teams introduced their first major car updates for the grand prix
mercedes ran a new front wing with a more pointy nose during first free practice

valtteri bottas was best of the rest ahead of sainz pérez and alonso
it was the first appearance in q3 for mclaren since they resumed their association with honda in <year>
sebastian vettel got past verstappen but was immediately repassed on the approach to turn four
at the front of the race coming out of turn three hamilton and rosberg collided ending the race of both mercedes drivers
the collision resulted in a safety car period with the order standing ricciardo verstappen sainz vettel and räikkönen
the safety car came in at the end of lap four
vettel got past sainz on lap eight and räikkönen tried to follow suit two laps later but was forced off track into turn two
he completed the move one lap later at the same spot
sainz and button were the first to come into the pits for new tyres on lap <num> followed by race leader ricciardo one lap later making verstappen the first dutchman to lead a grand prix before he came in another lap later

on lap <num> ricciardo was again the first of the front runners to pit taking on the soft compound
vettel came in two laps later making the same choice in tyres
this left verstappen to lead kimi räikkönen as it emerged that both would run on a different strategy pitting only twice in contrast to the three stopping vettel and ricciardo
on lap <num> the gap between the two leaders was <num>
<num> seconds before verstappen came in on the following lap
räikkönen responded one lap later emerging behind verstappen

he blamed the lack of downforce while following as the reason why he had been unable to pass verstappen
vettel congratulated the winner as well but lamented that his different strategy had not worked out in his favour
during the post @-@ race press conference räikkönen stressed that had anyone offered the team two podium positions after their poor performance in qualifying they would have taken it happily
fourth placed ricciardo expressed bitterness over red bull 's decision to switch him to a three @-@ stop strategy which eventually lost him a podium position saying i 'm a bit devastated
a big part of me is happy the team are on winning form but it 's hard to celebrate
his team later explained their decision declaring that they had focused their strategy on vettel who they had considered the biggest threat

he received considerable praise after the race with sky sports f1 's david croft saying that he has shown he has everything to be a world champion
his father jos verstappen himself a former grand prix driver declared that he considered his son a better driver than himself as race wins had eluded him during his own career in the sport
french sport newspaper l 'équipe declared verstappen to be already a great and in the big leagues
verstappen was also the first dutchman to win a race with the netherlands becoming the <num> country to produce a race winner
he was the tenth different winner of the spanish grand prix in as many past editions
following their collision hamilton and rosberg were summoned to the stewards after the race but neither received a penalty as the stewards rated their crash as a racing incident with no driver in particular to blame
it emerged that rosberg had chosen the wrong engine mode for the start being down on power which led to hamilton going for a passing manoeuvre
however rosberg remained convinced that he had done nothing wrong saying i made it very clear i wasn 't going to leave any space on the inside and i was very surprised he went for the gap
while hamilton apologised to the team after the incident he refused to accept blame for it
opinions about the incident varied while mercedes 's executive chairman niki lauda blamed hamilton for the crash former f1 driver anthony davidson said on sky sports f1 that rosberg 's move was very aggressive
three @-@ time world champion jackie stewart said after the race that mercedes should fine hamilton for the crash hamilton is to blame
rosberg was allowed to protect himself
you don ’ t go for it on the first lap
mercedes 's head of motorsport toto wolff stressed after the race that the team would continue to let their drivers race against each other freely a decision praised by former world champion alain prost
while rosberg said after the race that he comtemplated having a talk with hamilton about the situation mercedes later decided that they did not need clear @-@ the @-@ air talks
however it later emerged that the pair did have a conversation about the incident before the next race in monaco which according to hamilton was marked by pure respect
it was mercedes 's first double retirement since the <year> australian grand prix and the first time they failed to score a point since the <year> united states grand prix ending a <num> @-@ race long streak the third longest in formula one history
for his last lap collision with teammate jolyon palmer kevin magnussen received a ten @-@ second time penalty dropping him one place to <num>
he also received two penalty points to his licence
carlos sainz received a reprimand from the stewards for leaving the pit lane one minute before it was allowed
he escaped a more severe penalty because he stopped shortly afterwards thereby not gaining an advantage
upon his return to toro rosso daniil kvyat recorded the first fastest lap of his career and the first for the italian team in their <num> grand prix
with <num> points from the first four races nico rosberg remained on top of the drivers championship while hamilton 's retirement dropped him behind räikkönen who now trailed rosberg by <num> points four points ahead of hamilton

toro rosso moved ahead of haas into fifth while force india took seventh from mclaren
it was released on july <num> <year> by virgin records america as the lead single from glitter <year>
written and produced by carey larry blackmon thomas jenkins and clark kent loverboy is built around a sample from candy by cameo who are also featured on the track
lyrically the song finds carey fantasizing about her loverboy a man that will fulfill her physical and sexual desires
the recording was accompanied by an official remix titled loverboy remix featuring guest artists ludacris da brat shawnna and twenty ii
the track was subject to controversy following reports that jennifer lopez and tommy mottola carey 's ex @-@ husband stole the idea of sampling the singer 's original planned sample yellow magic orchestra 's firecracker over a month after carey had signed for it
since carey 's glitter was to be released over a month after lopez 's album she changed the song 's melody to sample from candy instead
controversy ensued following its release carey was hospitalized for severe mental and physical exhaustion following poorly received television appearances involving the song and album
after the song 's release in the united states loverboy stalled on the billboard hot <num>
the song reached a peak of number two on the hot <num> but failed to top the chart due to weak radio airplay
though finishing as the best @-@ selling song of <year> in the united states loverboy became carey 's first lead single to not reach number one
internationally the song failed to garner strong charting reaching the top @-@ ten in australia and canada and the top @-@ twenty in italy and the united kingdom
loverboy received generally mixed reviews from music critics many called the song unoriginal and dated while others felt that the featured artists primarily on the remix version overpowered carey and made the song disorganized
a music video directed by david lachapelle was shot for both versions of the song
the first version features carey as a scantily @-@ clad car girl waving a flag as her loverboy finishes a race
the video for the remix version features similar footage only including shots of the song 's guests in race @-@ cars during their verses
finally she performed loverboy live on the sweet sweet fantasy tour in <year>
on july <num> <year> carey made a surprise appearance on the mtv program total request live trl
as the show 's host carson daly began taping following a commercial break carey came out onto the filming stage pushing an ice cream cart while wearing a large men 's shirt
seemingly anxious and exhilarated carey began giving out individual bars of ice cream to fans and guests on the program while waving to the crowd down below on times square while diverging into a rambling monologue regarding therapy
carey then walked to daly 's platform and began a striptease in which she shed her shirt to reveal a tight yellow and green ensemble leading him to exclaim mariah carey has lost her mind
while she later revealed that daly was aware of her presence in the building prior to her appearance she admitted that he was meant to act surprised in order to provide a more dramatic effect for the program
carey 's appearance on trl garnered strong media attention with many critics and newspapers citing her behavior as troubled and erratic
in the days following her appearance on trl carey had begun displaying erratic behavior during a public record signing for the single at tower records in new york
as the appearance was filmed she began rambling on several points leading her to discuss radio @-@ host howard stern and how his form of humor on his program bothered her greatly
at that point carey 's publicist cindi berger grabbed the microphone from her hand and ordered the cameras to stop filming
only days later carey began posting irregular voice notes and messages on her official website i 'm trying to understand things in life right now and so i really don 't feel that i should be doing music right now
what i 'd like to do is just a take a little break or at least get one night of sleep without someone popping up about a video
all i really want is to just be me and that 's what i should have done in the first place
i don 't say this much but guess what i don 't take care of myself
after the quick removal of the messages berger commented that carey had been obviously exhausted and not thinking clearly when she posted the letters
two days later on july <num> she was suddenly hospitalized citing extreme exhaustion and a physical and emotional breakdown
following the heavy media coverage surrounding carey 's publicized breakdown and hospitalization virgin records and <num> century fox delayed the release of both the film 's soundtrack and the film itself for three weeks from august <num> to september <num> and from august <num> to september <num> respectively
following carey 's absence from the public eye as well as her abandonment of promotional appearances for the film and soundtrack her unprecedented <num> million five @-@ album record deal with virgin records emi records was bought out for <num> million
the decision was brought out due to the low sales of the project as well as the negative publicity surrounding her breakdown
soon after carey flew to capri italy for a period of five months in which she began writing material for her new album stemming from all the personal experiences she had endured throughout the past year
additionally she founded her own label modeled after her initials monarc entertainment and signed a new three @-@ album record deal with island records valued at over <num> million
at the time of the single 's release carey did not perform loverboy live
the first performance of the song came <num> years later on carey 's sweet sweet fantasy tour in <year>
aside from borrowing from the melody loverboy features cameo as a lead vocalist on the track
according to chuck taylor from billboard loverboy is reminiscent of several of carey 's previous lead singles as they too were predominantly built around samples of older songs
he described some of its background flourishes as swirling harmonies overtop and noted the inclusion of many shouts and ad @-@ libs from carey and cameo
due to the song 's heavy usage of the candy sample and the heavy blend of instrumentation and vocals he said that to his bewilderment the song was devoid of a standard hook
nme 's elios therepio felt the idea of sampling candy was genius on paper but once recorded suffered from various miscalculations
he felt it didn 't match the success carey 's previous single fantasy which also recalled its melody from an older song and criticized the inclusion of several over @-@ the @-@ top keyboard and synth arrangements
regarding carey 's voice aside from describing it as obscured therepio expressed his difficulty in understanding her lyrical phrases claiming it was weakened from no @-@ everyone @-@ can @-@ understand @-@ what @-@ you 're @-@ saying -itis
gil kaufman from mtv news noted the inclusion of bouncing funky bass and rock guitars while roger caitlin of the hartford courant described how carey was often reduced to breathy background vocals on loverboy
lyrically the song finds carey looking for her loverboy and a sugar @-@ daddy that 's going to love her right
therepio found it ironic how carey was crooning for a sugar @-@ daddy when she had just left one referring to her older ex @-@ husband tommy mottola
additionally he felt carey was molding her image from that of a balladeer to a pin @-@ up image of a pop star
the song 's lyrics are racy and feature the protagonist asking for her loverboy to fulfill her sexual desires loverboy come on and love me give me more
during this period she developed the concept for the album 's lead single loverboy
originally carey had sampled the melody and hook from the <year> yellow magic orchestra song firecracker using an interpolation of it throughout the chorus and introduction
in early theatrical trailers for glitter the original version of loverboy was still featured
as carey had ended her contract with columbia records jennifer lopez was signed by tommy mottola and had begun recording material for her album j
lo <year>
according to the inc
s irv gotti mottola head of columbia and carey 's ex @-@ husband knew of carey 's usage of the firecracker sample and attempted to have lopez use the same sample before her
at the time carey had become increasingly paranoid over outside executives being informed about glitter especially following news of lopez 's theft of the song
when the music publishers for firecracker were questioned they admitted carey had licensed usage of the sample first and lopez had signed for it over one month later under mottola 's arrangement
following the scandal carey was not able to use the original sample as lopez 's album was to be released far earlier than glitter
she subsequently changed the composition of loverboy and incorporated a new sample candy by cameo
according to gotti mottola contacted him with instructions to create the murder remix of i 'm real to sound exactly like another glitter track he produced titled if we featuring rappers ja rule and nate dogg
the firecracker sample was eventually used by lopez on her song i 'm real from her album j
lo
the remix of mariah 's loverboy featured rapper da brat singing a pointed message about bitches emulating her daily to the melody from firecracker
additionally several reviewers were not impressed with carey 's concealed vocals and the song 's overly @-@ complicated production
sarah rodman of the boston herald described the song 's production as a traffic @-@ jam and wrote loverboy is another in an increasingly long line of glitzy candy @-@ coated creatively stunted song
writing for the los angeles times natalie nichols felt loverboy was predictable and presented nothing new for carey 's audience
usa today 's edna gunderson wrote the song off as skimpy while glenn gamboa from newsday described its overall reception as lukewarm
harry guerin from raidió teilifís éireann outed the song as one of carey 's finest moments on glitter and disagreed with criticism regarding the overly @-@ populated musical background
allmusic editor stephen thomas erlewine listed the song as the only recommended song from glitter while gil kaufman of mtv news called it a fun uptempo dance number
craig seymour from entertainment weekly rated loverboy a c- and criticized its lyrical content and production
an anonymous writer from the guardian felt the song had no decipherable tune due to the inclusion of electronic musical instruments and background shouts and ad @-@ libs
billboard 's chuck taylor described the song as self @-@ sabotage and felt carey was gambling her longevity
he described the production as a mumbo jumbo of disparate elements and wrote the mighty may have fallen here

it has a different introduction the singing and spoken parts of cameo are greatly reduced and are not credited and additional raps are included by da brat ludacris shawnna and twenty ii

allāh pronounced ɑɫ 'ɫɑh is the arabic word referring to god in abrahamic religions
the word is thought to be derived by contraction from al ilāh which means the god and has cognates in other semitic languages including elah in aramaic ʾēl in canaanite and elohim in hebrew
the word allah has been used by arabs of different religions since pre @-@ islamic times
more specifically it has been used as a term to refer to god by muslims both arab and non @-@ arab and arab christians
it is now mainly used by muslims and arab christians to refer to god
it is also often albeit not exclusively used in this way by bábists bahá 'ís indonesian and maltese christians and mizrahi jews
similar usage by christians and sikhs in west malaysia has recently led to political and legal controversies
grammarians of the basra school regarded is as either formed spontaneously murtajal or as the definite form of lāh from the verbal root lyh with the meaning of lofty or hidden
others held that it was borrowed from syriac or hebrew but most considered it to be derived from a contraction of the arabic definite article al- the and ilāh deity god to al @-@ lāh meaning the deity or the god
the majority of modern scholars subscribe to the latter theory and view the loanword hypothesis with skepticism
cognates of the name allāh exist in other semitic languages including hebrew and aramaic
the corresponding aramaic form is elah אלה but its emphatic state is elaha אלהא
it is written as ܐܠܗܐ ʼĕlāhā in biblical aramaic and ܐܲܠܵܗܵܐ ʼalâhâ in syriac as used by the assyrian church both meaning simply god
biblical hebrew mostly uses the plural but functional singular form elohim אלהים but more rarely it also uses the singular form eloah אלוהּ
in the sikh scripture of guru granth sahib the term allah punjabi ਅਲਹੁ translit
ਅਲਾਹ is used <num> times
different theories have been proposed regarding the role of allah in pre @-@ islamic polytheistic cults
some authors have suggested that polytheistic arabs used the name as a reference to a creator god or a supreme deity of their pantheon
the term may have been vague in the meccan religion
according to one hypothesis which goes back to julius wellhausen allah the supreme deity of the tribal federation around quraysh was a designation that consecrated the superiority of hubal the supreme deity of quraysh over the other gods
however there is also evidence that allah and hubal were two distinct deities
according to that hypothesis the kaaba was first consecrated to a supreme deity named allah and then hosted the pantheon of quraysh after their conquest of mecca about a century before the time of muhammad
some inscriptions seem to indicate the use of allah as a name of a polytheist deity centuries earlier but we know nothing precise about this use
some scholars have suggested that allah may have represented a remote creator god who was gradually eclipsed by more particularized local deities
there is disagreement on whether allah played a major role in the meccan religious cult
no iconic representation of allah is known to have existed
muhammad 's father 's name was ʿabd @-@ allāh meaning the slave of allāh
arabic @-@ speakers of all abrahamic faiths including christians and jews use the word allah to mean god
the christian arabs of today have no other word for god than allah
even the arabic @-@ descended maltese language of malta whose population is almost entirely roman catholic uses alla for god
arab christians for example use the terms allāh al @-@ ab الله الأب for god the father allāh al @-@ ibn الله الابن for god the son and allāh al @-@ rūḥ al @-@ quds الله الروح القدس for god the holy spirit
see god in christianity for the christian concept of god
arab christians have used two forms of invocations that were affixed to the beginning of their written works
they adopted the muslim bismillāh and also created their own trinitized bismillāh as early as the <num> century
the muslim bismillāh reads in the name of god the compassionate the merciful
the trinitized bismillāh reads in the name of father and the son and the holy spirit one god
the syriac latin and greek invocations do not have the words one god at the end
this addition was made to emphasize the monotheistic aspect of trinitarian belief and also to make it more palatable to muslims
according to marshall hodgson it seems that in the pre @-@ islamic times some arab christians made pilgrimage to the kaaba a pagan temple at that time honoring allah there as god the creator
some archaeological excavation quests have led to the discovery of ancient pre @-@ islamic inscriptions and tombs made by arab christians in the ruins of a church at umm el @-@ jimal in northern jordan which contained references to allah as the proper name of god and some of the graves contained names such as abd allah which means the servant slave of allah
the name allah can be found countless times in the reports and the lists of names of christian martyrs in south arabia as reported by antique syriac documents of the names of those martyrs from the era of the himyarite and aksumite kingdoms
a christian leader named abd allah ibn abu bakr ibn muhammad was martyred in najran in <num> as he had worn a ring that said allah is my lord
in an inscription of christian martyrion dated back to <num> references to allah can be found in both arabic and aramaic which called him allah and alaha and the inscription starts with the statement by the help of allah
in pre @-@ islamic gospels the name used for god was allah as evidenced by some discovered arabic versions of the new testament written by arab christians during the pre @-@ islamic era in northern and southern arabia
pre @-@ islamic arab christians have been reported to have raised the battle cry ya la ibad allah o slaves of allah to invoke each other into battle
allah was also mentioned in pre @-@ islamic christian poems by some ghassanid and tanukhid poets in syria and northern arabia
according to islamic belief allah is the most common word to represent god and humble submission to his will divine ordinances and commandments is the pivot of the muslim faith
he is the only god creator of the universe and the judge of humankind
he is unique wāḥid and inherently one aḥad all @-@ merciful and omnipotent
the qur 'an declares the reality of allah his inaccessible mystery his various names and his actions on behalf of his creatures
in islamic tradition there are <num> names of god al @-@ asmā ’ al @-@ ḥusná lit
meaning the best names or the most beautiful names each of which evoke a distinct characteristic of allah
all these names refer to allah the supreme and all @-@ comprehensive divine name
among the <num> names of god the most famous and most frequent of these names are the merciful al @-@ raḥmān and the compassionate al @-@ raḥīm
most muslims use the untranslated arabic phrase in shā ’ allāh meaning if god wills after references to future events
muslim discursive piety encourages beginning things with the invocation of bismillāh meaning in the name of god
there are certain phrases in praise of god that are favored by muslims including subḥān allāh holiness be to god al @-@ ḥamdu lillāh praise be to god lā ilāha illā allāh there is no deity but god and allāhu akbar god is greater as a devotional exercise of remembering god dhikr
in a sufi practice known as dhikr allah lit
remembrance of god the sufi repeats and contemplates on the name allah or other divine names while controlling his or her breath
some scholars have suggested that muḥammad used the term allah in addressing both pagan arabs and jews or christians in order to establish a common ground for the understanding of the name for god a claim gerhard böwering says is doubtful
according to böwering in contrast with pre @-@ islamic arabian polytheism god in islam does not have associates and companions nor is there any kinship between god and jinn
pre @-@ islamic pagan arabs believed in a blind powerful inexorable and insensible fate over which man had no control
this was replaced with the islamic notion of a powerful but provident and merciful god
according to francis edwards peters the qur ’ ān insists muslims believe and historians affirm that muhammad and his followers worship the same god as the jews <num> <num>
the qur ’ an 's allah is the same creator god who covenanted with abraham
peters states that the qur 'an portrays allah as both more powerful and more remote than yahweh and as a universal deity unlike yahweh who closely follows israelites
however in his biography of muḥammad <year> tor andræ always used the term allah though he allows that this conception of god seems to imply that it is different from that of the jewish and christian theologies
languages which may not commonly use the term allah to denote god may still contain popular expressions which use the word
for example because of the centuries long muslim presence in the iberian peninsula the word ojalá in the spanish language and oxalá in the portuguese language exist today borrowed from arabic arabic إن شاء الله
this phrase literally means if god wills in the sense of i hope so
the german poet mahlmann used the form allah as the title of a poem about the ultimate deity though it is unclear how much islamic thought he intended to convey
some muslims leave the name allāh untranslated in english
the word has also been applied to certain living human beings as personifications of the term and concept
mainstream bible translations in the language use allah as the translation of hebrew elohim translated in english bibles as god
this goes back to early translation work by francis xavier in the <num> century
the first dictionary of dutch @-@ malay by albert cornelius ruyl justus heurnius and caspar wiltens in <year> revised edition from <year> edition and <year> latin @-@ edition recorded allah as the translation of the dutch word godt
ruyl also translated matthew in <year> to malay language first bible translation to non @-@ european language only a year after king james version was published which was printed in the netherlands in <year>
then he translated mark which was published in <year>
the government of malaysia in <year> outlawed usage of the term allah in any other but muslim contexts but the malayan high court in <year> revoked the law ruling that it was unconstitutional
while allah had been used for the christian god in malay for more than four centuries the contemporary controversy was triggered by usage of allah by the roman catholic newspaper the herald
the government appealed the court ruling and the high court suspended implementation of its verdict until the appeal was heard
in october <year> the court ruled in favor of the government 's ban
in early <year> the malaysian government confiscated more than <num> bibles for using the word to refer to the christian god in peninsular malaysia
however the use of allah is not prohibited in the two malaysian state of sabah and sarawak
the main reason it is not prohibited in these two states is that usage has been long @-@ established and local alkitab bibles have been widely distributed freely in east malaysia without restrictions for years
both states also do not have similar islamic state laws as those in west malaysia
as a reaction to some media criticism the malaysian government has introduced a <num> @-@ point solution to avoid confusion and misleading information
the <num> @-@ point solution is in line with the spirit of the <num> and <num> @-@ point agreements of sarawak and sabah
this includes urdu persian dari uyghur among others
this is because the spelling was settled before arabic spelling started habitually using alif to spell ā
however in vocalized spelling a small diacritic alif is added on top of the shaddah to indicate the pronunciation
one exception may be in the pre @-@ islamic zabad inscription where it ends with an ambiguous sign that may be a lone @-@ standing h with a lengthened start or may be a non @-@ standard conjoined l @-@ h الاه this reading would be allāh spelled phonetically with alif for the ā
الإله this reading would be al @-@ ilāh the god an older form without contraction by older spelling practice without alif for ā
many arabic type fonts feature special ligatures for allah
instead the word allāh should be represented by its individual arabic letters while modern font technologies will render the desired ligature
the calligraphic variant of the word used as the coat of arms of iran is encoded in unicode in the miscellaneous symbols range at codepoint u 262b ☫
during the initial recording sessions for the album in <year> in fez morocco the band wrote the song with producers brian eno and daniel lanois within a few hours
together they recorded the song in a single take eno called the song 's recording the most amazing studio experience he 's ever had
according to him and lanois the track is the closest the band came to realising their original concept for the album of writing future hymns
the seven @-@ minute song features gospel @-@ like vocals in the chorus along with a predominantly organ- and piano @-@ based musical accompaniment
lyrically the song is about a drug addict who is undergoing a crisis of faith
moment of surrender was praised by critics many of whom called it one of the album 's stand @-@ out tracks
the song was compared to the group 's earlier ballads with or without you and one
it was performed at all but two of the band 's concerts on the u2 <num> ° tour most often as the closing song
during performances the stage lights were dimmed and fans were urged to hold up their mobile phones to create a stadium full of tiny stars
although it was not released as a single rolling stone named moment of surrender the best song of <year> and in <year> they ranked it <num> on their list of the <num> greatest songs of all time
the song was developed within a few hours and then recorded in a single take in a riad of the hotel riad el yacout
eno began by creating a percussion loop of a rolling hand drum so that the band would have something to improvise along with when they joined him for songwriting and recording
however eno had not arranged the loop properly and the result was a strange uneven beat that he compared to a wheeled carriage that had one of the wheels a bit cracked or the way a camel moves
although eno was trying to fix the loop drummer larry mullen jr
began playing along to it
eno then asked guitarist the edge to play some chords
after a quick discussion about the chord changes and the meter in which they decided to have a funny layout that was not based on eighths or sixteenths the six of them improvised the entirety of the piece
as they began to play bassist adam clayton developed a bassline
the part was originally based on the grandmaster melle mel song white lines don 't don 't do it before clayton changed to a more trance @-@ like bassline
vocalist bono created some melodies and sang over the music
during the album 's recording bono had become tired of writing in the first @-@ person and he began writing lyrics and singing from the perspective of different characters
during the writing of moment of surrender bono assumed the character of a drug addict having a crisis of faith
the song title was borrowed from the alcoholics anonymous term for when an addict admits being powerless over alcohol and needs help
bono had attempted to use the phrase vision over visibility in the lyrics of earlier songs however moment of surrender was the first song where he felt it was appropriate to be used
eno called bono 's singing in this character as so heartbreaking agonized and vulnerable creating a feeling like a knife to the heart
lanois contributed by developing the gospel @-@ like chorus
the uneven hi @-@ hat from the drum part stems from mullen 's electronic drum kit malfunctioning during the song 's recording
eno was amazed by each performer 's ability to develop and play their part without any instructions or cues
after the song 's recording completed everyone in the studio including a gathering of production personnel and visitors was completely silent and eno suggested it was as if they had gone on an emotional adventure of some kind
he called the song 's recording the most amazing studio experience i 've ever had and he believes the emotional crescendo heard in the song properly captures how they felt as they improvised the piece
bono stated it was a spell and we were in it
the song was played only once and received minor treatments afterwards with the addition of a cello part in the introduction and some editing which included removing a verse to reduce the song 's length
eno was outraged that u2 wanted to shorten the song and he was adamant that the band not alter the original track too much saying these fucking guys they 're supposed to be so spiritual — they don 't spot a miracle when it hits them in the face
nothing like that ever happened to me in the studio in my whole life
the band 's original concept for no line on the horizon was to create an album of future hymns — songs that would be played forever
according to eno and lanois moment of surrender is the closest the band came to reaching that concept
the song makes use of the conventional verse @-@ chorus form
the song begins with an uneven percussion loop before an ambient synthesiser fades in and the drums enter at <num> <num>
a cello part joins and the synthesiser plays the chord progression c – am – f – c – g – e – d7
at the end of the progression <num> seconds into the song the intensity of the synthesier rises before an organ bass guitar and piano subsequently enter
at <num> <num> bono 's vocals enter and the first verse begins lasting three stanzas
after the first chorus concludes and the second verse begins at <num> <num> the edge begins playing a guitar riff
the second verse lasts two stanzas
after the second chorus a piano interlude begins with lanois contributing pedal steel
the edge begins a slide guitar solo at <num> <num> that many critics compared to the playing style of pink floyd 's david gilmour
after the third chorus ends at <num> <num> oh @-@ oh @-@ ohhh vocals and a guitar figure bring the song to its conclusion
lanois noted that the song had a very canadian sound that was like a tribute to the band calling it the simcoe sound
rolling stone said the song merges a joshua tree @-@ style gospel feel with a hypnotically loping bass line and a syncopated beat
the song makes prominent use of organ and piano
david fricke of rolling stone enjoyed the song writing the rising @-@ falling effect of the harmony voices around bono
is a perfect picture of where he really wants to be when he gets to the line about vision over visibility
blender considered it the high @-@ point of the album comparing it to the band 's <year> single i still haven 't found what i 'm looking for
reviewer rob sheffield complimented the melding of bass guitar and vocals calling it the kind of gimme @-@ divinity anthem that u2 cut their teeth on except it really does seem like they 've gotten better at these songs now that they 've picked up some bummed @-@ out adult grit
bono actually sounds scared of something in this song and whether his nightmares are religious or sexual the fear gives his voice some heft
nme felt that it was the most impressive song on the album describing it as a gorgeously sparse prayer built around adam clayton 's heartbeat bassline and bono 's rough growl and noting that despite its seven @-@ minute length it did not feel too long
alexis petridis of the guardian was more critical of the song saying it doesn 't have enough of a tune to support the full seven @-@ minute gospel treatment a sentiment that the times agreed with
spin reviewed the track favourably calling it a celebrity @-@ at @-@ the @-@ crossroads soul ballad with an ambient gospel sweep that 's both haunted and joyful
mojo praised the song 's musicianship saying it was graced by swaggering performances and that the edge 's languid guitar solo was reminiscent of david gilmour
q echoed these sentiments commending bono 's soulful singing and the edge 's solo
the reviewer christened the song as this album 's one or with or without you with added bonus points
the washington post called the song one of the record 's highlights and enjoyed the track 's gospel qualities
the reviewer wrote the vocal harmonies on the choruses sound like something out of a church in some distant dystopian world the woozy slightly detuned piano adds to that impression
hot press gave the song a favourable review calling it a sweeping track and suggesting it conjure s the same spiritual vibe as marvin gaye 's abraham martin john
time gave no line on the horizon a negative review but praised moment of surrender for its heartbreaking melody and bono 's oh @-@ oh @-@ oh vocals that reminded the critic of the end of with or without you
bono and daniel lanois both cited the song as their favourite track on the album and brian eno thought the band should have chosen it as the album 's first single
musician gavin friday described the song as al green on irish steroids and hot press editor niall stokes called it a modern rock classic that will stand forever as one of u2 's most inspirational creations
despite not being released as a single moment of surrender charted in two countries
in the united states the song appeared on the mediabase triple a chart at number <num> for the week of <num> november <year>
in belgium the song appeared on the ultratop <num> singles chart wallonia for a week at number <num>
it was played at nearly every subsequent concert on the tour as the closing song being excluded from the setlist for only two of the tour 's <num> shows the <num> december <year> concert in brisbane australia and the <num> may <year> concert in winnipeg
prior to performances of moment of surrender a disco ball was lowered and the stage lights turned off and bono encouraged fans to take out their mobile phones and create a stadium full of tiny stars
the national post commented that despite being a big @-@ concert cliché the move was effective and created a feeling of intimacy amongst the audience
rolling stone enjoyed the visual effect in context of the tour 's space theme saying it truly made it seem like the stadium had reached outerspace with thousands of cellphone lights turning into stars
the daily telegraph praised the galaxy of mobile phones saying that despite the tour 's impressive stage and visual effects the most beautiful sight came when we couldn 't see the stage
in reviewing a paris show from july <year> the sunday times called moment of surrender the only track from no line on the horizon performed that evening that was strong enough to deserve inclusion with the rest of the show 's set list
nme was not as receptive to the song in a live setting questioning the decision to end concerts with the song

according to broadley and cock <year> it is generally found in environments that are parallel to those occupied by its close relative b
arietans which is normally found in more open country
in tanzania this species is found in secondary thickets cashew plantations and in agricultural land under bushes and in thickets
in uganda they are found in forests and nearby grasslands
they also do well in reclaimed forest areas cacao plantations in west africa and coffee plantations in east africa
they have been found in evergreen forests in zambia
in zimbabwe they only occur in areas of high rainfall along the forested escarpment in the east of the country
in general they may also be found in swamps as well as in still and moving waters
they are commonly found in agricultural areas near forests and on roads at night
they usually hunt by ambush often spending long periods motionless waiting for suitable prey to happen by
on the other hand they have been known to hunt actively mostly during the first six hours of the night
in kumasi ghana they were regularly killed around some stables in an open area with the forest some <num> meters away — a sign that they were hunting rats in the grassland
they are usually very tolerant snakes even when handled and rarely bite or hiss unlike most vipers
however bites by bad @-@ tempered individuals do occur
locomotion is mostly rectilinear in a sluggish walking motion of the ventral scales
they may writhe from side to side when alarmed but only for short distances
ditmars <year> even described them as being capable of sidewinding
if threatened they may hiss loudly as a warning doing so in a deep and steady rhythm slightly flattening the head at the expiration of each breath
despite this they are unlikely to strike unless severely provoked however they are one of fastest striking snakes in the world so care should be taken in handling them
there have been numerous descriptions of their generally unaggressive nature
sweeney <year> wrote they are so docile that they can be handled as freely as any non @-@ venomous species although this is absolutely not recommended
in lane <year> ionides explained he would capture specimens by first touching them lightly on the top of the head with a pair of tongs to test their reactions
anger was rarely displayed so the tongs were usually set aside and the snakes firmly grasped by the neck with one hand and the body supported with the other as he picked them up and carried them to a box for containment
he said the snakes hardly ever struggled
parry <year> described how this species has a wider range of eye movement than other snakes
along a horizontal plane eye movement can be maintained even if the head is rotated up or down to an angle of up to <num> °
if the head is rotated <num> ° one eye will tilt up and the other down depending on the direction of rotation
also if one eye looks forward the other looks back as if both are connected to a fixed position on an axis between them
in general the eyes often flick back and forth in a rapid and jerky manner
when asleep there is no eye movement and the pupils are strongly contracted
the pupils dilate suddenly and eye movement resumes when the animal wakes up
when prey happens by they strike with very fast precision from any angle
once they strike their prey they hang on to it with their large fangs rather than letting it go and waiting for it to die
this behaviour is very different from the behaviour of other species of vipers
these snakes feed on a variety of birds and mammals such as doves many different species of rodents including field mice and rats as well as hares and rabbits
there are also reports of more unlikely prey items such as tree monkeys the brush @-@ tailed porcupine atherurus and even the small royal antelope neotragus
this starts with one male rubbing its chin along the back of the other
the second male will then raise its head as high as possible
as they both do the same the necks intertwine
when the heads are level they turn towards each other and push
their bodies intertwine as they switch positions
they become oblivious to everything else continuing even after they fall off a surface or into water
sometimes they intertwine and squeeze so tightly that their scales stand out from the pressure
they have also been observed to strike at each other with mouths closed
occasionally the combatants will tire and break off the fight by mutual consent resting for a while before resuming once more
the event is settled when one of the two succeeds in pushing the other 's head to the ground and raising its own by <num> – <num> cm
in captivity combat may occur four or five times a week until courtship and copulation ends
gestation takes about <num> months which suggests a breeding cycle of two to three years
a five @-@ year breeding cycle may also be possible
usually they give birth in late summer

g
rhinoceros may produce as many as <num>
however the actual number of offspring rarely exceeds <num>
neonates are <num> – <num> cm in length and weigh <num> – <num> g
due to their sluggishness and unwillingness to move even when approached bites most often occur due to persons accidentally stepping on a gaboon viper but even then in some cases this does not guarantee a bite
however when a bite does occur it should always be considered a serious medical emergency
even an average bite from an average @-@ sized specimen is potentially fatal
antivenom should be administered as soon as possible to save the victim 's life if not the affected limb
the snake 's cytotoxic venom itself is not considered particularly toxic based on tests conducted in mice
in mice the ld50 is <num>
<num> – <num>
<num> mg kg iv <num>
<num> mg kg ip and <num>
<num> – <num>
<num> mg kg sc
however the venom glands are enormous and each bite produces the largest quantities of venom of any venomous snake this is partially due to the fact that unlike many african vipers such as the puff adder the gaboon viper does not release after a bite which enables it to inject larger amounts of venom
yield is probably related to body weight as opposed to milking interval
brown <year> gives a venom yield range of <num> – <num> mg of dried venom a range of <num> – <num> mg for specimens <num> – <num> cm in length has also been reported
spawls and branch <year> state from <num> to <num> ml <num> – <num> mg of venom may be injected in a single bite
a study by marsh and whaler <year> reported a maximum yield of <num>
<num> ml of wet venom which translated to <num> mg of dried venom
they attached alligator clip electrodes to the angle of the open jaw of anesthetized specimens length <num> – <num> cm girth <num> – <num> cm weight <num>
<num> – <num>
<num> kg yielding <num>
<num> – <num>
<num> ml mean <num>
<num> ml of venom
two to three electrical bursts within a space of five seconds apart were enough to empty the venom glands
the gaboon vipers used for the study were milked between seven and <num> times over a <num> @-@ month period during which they remained in good health and the potency of their venom remained the same
based on how sensitive monkeys were to the venom whaler <year> estimated <num> mg of venom would be enough to kill a human being equivalent to <num>
<num> ml of venom or <num> <num> to <num> <num> of what can be obtained in a single milking
marsh and whaler <year> wrote that <num> mg <num> <num> of the average venom yield would be enough to kill a man of <num> kilograms <num> lb
branch <year> suggested that <num> – <num> mg would be fatal in humans
due to the rarity of these type of snakebites further investigation is needed
in humans a bite causes rapid and conspicuous swelling intense pain severe shock and local blistering
other symptoms may include uncoordinated movements defecation urination swelling of the tongue and eyelids convulsions and unconsciousness
blistering bruising and necrosis may be extensive
there may be sudden hypotension heart damage and dyspnoea
the blood may become incoagulable with internal bleeding that may lead to haematuria and haematemesis
local tissue damage may require surgical excision and possibly amputation
healing may be slow and fatalities during the recovery period are not uncommon

it was first shown on the fox network on november <num> <year> in the united states
the episode was written by chris carter and directed by kim manners
the sixth extinction earned a nielsen household rating of <num>
<num> being watched by <num>
<num> million people in its initial broadcast
the episode received mixed to positive reviews from critics
the show centers on fbi special agents fox mulder david duchovny and dana scully gillian anderson who work on cases linked to the paranormal called x @-@ files
mulder is a believer in the paranormal while the skeptical scully has been assigned to debunk his work
in the episode assistant director walter skinner mitch pileggi and michael kritschgau john finn work desperately in an attempt to discover what is wrong with mulder who is imprisoned by his own frenetic brain activity but they are unaware of agent diana fowley ’ s mimi rogers duplicity
in the meanwhile scully is hunting for an ancient artifact in africa
the sixth extinction helped to explore new aspects of the series overarching mythology and was the second episode in a trilogy of episodes featuring mulder 's severe reaction to the appearance of an alien artifact
the episode was written due to series creator chris carter 's fascination with the possibility that extraterrestrials were involved in the great extinctions that had happened millions of years ago
a figure the primitive african man mysteriously appears before suddenly vanishing after which scully 's tent is swarmed by flying insects
back in the united states walter skinner visits a delusional fox mulder who is being kept in a padded cell at a georgetown hospital
mulder seemingly attacks skinner but actually covertly passes him a torn shred of his hospital gown reading help me
scully is visited by dr
amina ngebe solomon merkmellen 's former colleague who warns scully to not tell any of the locals about the swarm or the primitive african man although word is already out on the african internet
soon afterwards one of the locals working on excavating the ship is apparently scalded by boiling seawater
with the arrival of dr
barnes another plague occurs – that night the ocean turns blood red
skinner revisits a heavily drugged mulder who cannot talk but writes kritschgau
skinner goes to visit kritschgau now unemployed and living in a low @-@ cost apartment and convinces him to visit the hospital with him
once there kritschgau believes mulder has alien induced mind reading abilities and injects him with a drug phenytoin to slow down his brain activity
later diana fowley and his doctor arrive and with his mind @-@ reading abilities mulder is able to tell skinner that he knows about him being indebted to krycek and diana fowley 's connections with the cigarette smoking man
scully with dr
barnes help is able to translate some of the spaceship which contains information on genetics and various religions
dr
barnes behavior becomes increasingly erratic however and armed with a machete he refuses to let scully or ngebe leave
he soon realizes that the craft is bringing dead fish back to life and scully and ngebe take the opportunity to knock him out and escape
scully sees the vanishing man again in the car as they drive off
kritschgau and skinner put mulder under additional tests to verify his abnormal brain activity
they again inject mulder with phenytoin but this time they are caught by fowley and mulder goes into a seizure
meanwhile dr
barnes in a bizarre type of experiment kills his driver but the driver soon reanimates and kills him instead
scully flies back to the u
s
and visits mulder at the hospital
on the african coast ngebe arrives with the police finding dr
barnes dead and the spaceship gone
all the things that had sustained us for six years were suddenly gone
we had no crutches
from that point on every time we sat down to write a mythology show we knew it was going to be a completely different challenge
chris carter saw the episode as a transitional episode stating i felt that with the sixth extinction i was just playing a supporting role and that the episode essentially the middle episode of a three @-@ episode arc was just a transitional episode to get us to amor fati which was really less about the mythology and more about mulder 's choices in life
david duchovny and gillian anderson both had other commitments as the season began resulting in the producers delaying filming for this episode
it ended up being filmed third in the season after the episodes hungry and the goldberg variation
carter wrote the episode at the same time as duchovny was working on the next episode the sixth extinction ii amor fati
kim manners said preparations were confusing since it wasn 't known at the time how the storyline would unfold
spotnitz said of the end result for me it was a lot like a fifties monster movie with scully out on the beach with this guy going nuts with a machete the bug attacks and the sea of blood
yeah it was supposed to be serious business but overall i thought it was shaping up as a pretty entertaining hour
the producers had to move the filming of the beach sequences from the previous episodes due to changes in the tides at that time of year
similar to the previous episode the spaceship was computer @-@ generated
the sequence where the locals are boiled by the ocean water was accomplished using underwater filming of stuntmen under various degrees of make up
fifty thousand dead crickets were rented from a local entomologist for the scene where scully 's tent was attacked by bugs
the live insects were portrayed by blowing popcorn and packing foam at anderson with fans and editing it into insects in post production
a large portion of the episode was based on the ancient astronaut theory which proposes that intelligent extraterrestrial beings have visited earth in antiquity or prehistory and made contact with humans
frank spotnitz later remarked that he was astounded at how little negative fan mail the show received despite the fact that the biogenesis the sixth extinction amor fati story arc heavily hinted that aliens were the originators of the notion of god and religion
he credited the manner in which the show handled this delicate subject saying often in the past we 've done stuff where i was sure we would get angry letters
but we rarely do
and the reason is because of the way we handle things
in amor fati we treated the religious side with respect
the ancient astronaut themes were later revisited in the two season nine episodes provenance and providence
this episode earned a nielsen rating of <num>
<num> with a <num> share meaning that roughly <num>
<num> percent of all television @-@ equipped households and <num> percent of households watching television were tuned in to the episode
it was viewed by <num>
<num> million viewers and was the most watched episode of the seventh season in the united states
the episode aired in the united kingdom and ireland on sky1 on may <num> <year> and received <num>
<num> million viewers and was the third most watched episode that week
fox promoted the episode with the tagline something is driving mulder insane
something he 's been searching for
something he shouldn 't have found
the episode was later included on the x @-@ files mythology volume <num> – colonization a dvd collection that contains episodes involved with the alien colonist 's plans to take over the earth
tom kessenich in his book examination an unauthorized look at seasons <num> – <num> of the x @-@ files gave the episode a positive review noting that the episode takes the themes of biogenesis and runs with them
ken tucker of entertainment weekly awarded the episode a b
tucker praised series creator chris carter 's writing ability stating that the kickoff episode suggests the author 's limitless imagination for sustaining his alien @-@ nation tropes
robert shearman and lars pearson in their book wanting to believe a critical guide to the x @-@ files millennium the lone gunmen rated the episode three @-@ and @-@ a @-@ half stars out of five
the two called the episode the most arresting season opener in years and noted that it promises that maybe there 's life in the old mythology yet
shearman and pearson however did critique the lack of finality to the episode but attributed most of this to the fact that the episode was the second of a three @-@ part mythology tale
den of geek writer nina sordi ranked the sixth extinction along with biogenesis and the sixth extinction ii amor fati as the fifth best episode of the series writing it is evident that as the x @-@ files progressed the episodes surrounding those storylines and the breaking points mulder and scully endured push them further and further towards total irreversible defeat
this is especially poignant when viewing this anxiety inducing trio of episodes
monica s
kuebler of exclaim magazine called the sixth extinction along with biogenesis and amor fati one of the best episodes during the show 's colonization phase
kenneth silber of space
com wrote positively of the episode hoping that it foreshadowed answers to come writing as the middle installment of a three @-@ part story and what was then thought to be the final season premiere of the x @-@ files the sixth extinction is suffused with a somber pre @-@ apocalyptic mood but one vivified by the possibility that soon we 'll have answers to the most important outstanding mysteries of the series
not all reviews were so positive
paula vitaris from cinefantastique gave the episode a negative review and awarded it one @-@ and @-@ a @-@ half stars out of four
she noted that mulder 's situation is handled just poorly and argued that mulder 's illness was created solely to provide a cross @-@ season cliffhanger
todd vanderwerff of the a
v
club awarded the episode a c and called it a weird bridge
largely he criticized the episode for featuring no real twists or complications here in lieu of things just … getting worse along a linear path

the episode takes place almost entirely over a single day telling three stories in a non @-@ linear narrative
peggy becomes alienated after separate fights with her boyfriend abe and a client
roger and jane take lsd with a group of intellectuals altering how they see the world and allowing them to speak honestly about their marriage
don and megan leave the office and take an impromptu road trip to plattsburgh new york which doesn 't turn out as planned after megan becomes aggrieved with how don treats her
far away places was watched by <num>
<num> million viewers and achieved <num>
<num> million viewers in the key <num> – <num> demographic
the episode received overwhelming critical acclaim with many critics noting the episode 's formal experiments with and focus on the passage of time
the sequence where roger and jane take lsd was particularly celebrated for the visual excellence and performances by john slattery and peyton list
the theme of the episode was pinpointed by the series writers and television journalists as the desire to escape
the argument ends with abe leaving in a huff
after don pulls megan away for an impromptu trip to a howard johnson 's hotel in far northern new york peggy has to pitch to the heinz executives without them
peggy unsuccessfully tries to sell the heinz executives on her concept
frustrated she leaves work has a couple of drinks and goes to see the film born free
she sees a young man smoking marijuana behind her partakes herself and eventually gives him a hand job
she returns to her office to see ginsberg arguing with his father
after being told off by ginsberg for eavesdropping she falls asleep in don 's office
she awakens to a call from don who seems alarmed for incomprehensible reasons
don hangs up on her and peggy returns to her office
when peggy asks about ginsberg 's life ginsberg initially claims to be a martian stating that morris ginsberg is not his father
michael was born in a nazi concentration camp and after its liberation morris claimed him from a swedish orphanage when michael was five years old
peggy returns home affected by this story and calls abe
she tells him about ginsberg and asks him to come over to be with her
roger and jane go to the party which is hosted by jane 's therapist and her husband
after dinner roger asks jane if they can leave but jane reminds roger that he agreed to take lsd with the group and begs him to stay as she doesn 't want to go through the experience alone
roger is initially unimpressed with the drug but comes around after his consciousness begins to change with vivid audio @-@ visual hallucinations
roger and jane return home via taxi and take a bath together during which roger imagines he is watching the <year> world series from the bathtub
the couple then talks candidly about their marriage for the first time
during this moment of awareness jane admits that she knows the marriage is over
the next morning a jovial roger says goodbye to a shocked jane who appears regretful about what she said the night before
as he and megan eat in the restaurant megan expresses her frustration at having her needs and desires take a back seat to don 's
the discussion escalates into a fight during which megan makes a hurtful remark about don 's mother and don storms out and drives off without her
don returns sometime later and begins to worry when he can 't find megan
he spends hours looking for and waiting for her calling peggy the other side of the conversation from the first part of the episode as well as megan 's mother in montreal
after waiting for hours at howard johnson 's and phoning home repeatedly don drives home in the early morning to find megan in their apartment with the security chain on the door
don kicks the door in violently struggles with megan and chases her through the apartment
megan and don trip and collapse on the floor as megan weeps
don tearfully hugs her at the waist and tells her he thought he had lost her
don is beckoned to the conference room where bert cooper admonishes him for being on love leave
don replies that his love life is none of bert 's business
bert retorts that it is in fact his business and admits astonishment that the firm is running as well as it is with how little don is actually working
bert leaves don standing alone in the conference room as don looks through the picture windows at the employees going about their business
he further explained that peggy has this moment where she tries to be don and fails and then goes on peggy 's version of don – sexually irresponsible and drunk and working
elisabeth moss said the handjob peggy gives a stranger in the theatre is a moment of forgetting after the frustrating heinz pitch
weiner spoke about the structure of the episode in june <year> structurally i love this french movie by max ophüls called le plaisir
it 's three or four guy de maupassant stories that are told by a narrator and then characters start to appear behind each other their stories overlap and they are just walking through and you realize it 's a complete world
what i loved about that was just telling the story from that one person ’ s point of view
in peggy 's story she 's in every scene nothing happens without her there
and it 's the same thing with don and the same thing with roger
so you 're really getting this very private perspective and then thematically holding it together by saying here this is about the status of the relationship
we weren 't sure that it was going to work
the hardest part was breaking it up for commercials so that the peggy and the roger stories would be in the same segment and you wouldn 't come back and think you were in the middle of another episode
he spoke about the writing of a scene of the episode in august <year> i had in the writers room given this speech about ginsberg saying he was a martian
i delivered it as ginsberg
we knew that peggy 's story was going to climax with that and it was going to be their great moment of intimacy he would distract her from her failure and bond with her in that strange way that people who feel separate do
then when we were writing the draft i got the notes from the room and the speech was like one sentence
we searched everywhere and it turned out i had never pitched more than that one sentence i 'm a martian
i had a great version of it but it turned out it had all been in my head in one way or another
it all had to come from scratch
once i reduced the panic and tried to re @-@ create it it did happen
so to me it still has a magical quality to it
weiner characterized roger 's acid trip as an experience of complete honesty and an experience of empathy something he 's probably never experienced in his life
he doesn 't see the world through other people 's lives and that kind of epiphany to me is very beautiful even though it 's the end of the relationship
they are alone in the truth together
while discussing the fight between don and megan weiner commented on the violence and passion noting that what you get is that don loves this woman and that megan is everything that 's good to him
jessica pare commented on don 's lack of respect for her work and jon hamm judged don 's actions as immature
however hamm regarded don 's fear as genuine when he is unsure of megan 's whereabouts
the flashback scene between don and megan in the car was actually shot for the fourth season finale tomorrowland written and directed by weiner but was cut
weiner decided to reinsert this scene into the episode as a flashback
the exterior scenes of the howard johnson 's hotel were filmed in october <year> at the regency inn and suites in baldwin park california
the hotel operated as a howard johnson 's from <year> until it was sold in <year>
editor christopher gay spoke about the episode in august <year> narratively speaking we wanted the stories of these three relations of peggy roger and don to be their own story
we wanted to give you a little bit more each time you saw each of the three story lines so that when you got to the third one everything totally made sense
i 've talked to people and they 've had to watch it a few times to fully digest
also the score in the episode is pretty unique and more tonal and atmospheric than what we normally do
it 's a guide too that helps you feel when one story is ending and another is coming in and knowing that the shift is happening
i think the score and the sound design definitely helped guide the narrative
alan sepinwall of hitfix exalted the episode and the more formally experimental season admitting i 'm still not sure i understood <num> of it
but i know i liked it
a lot
sepinwall characterized far away places as an episode that gave the feel of dropping acid even when everyone on camera was stone sober
matt weiner co @-@ writer semi chellas director scott hornbacher and the actors combined to give us some of the most memorable moments the show has ever done
todd vanderwerff of the a
v
club gave it an a grade compared it to previous structurally daring episodes like seven twenty three and the jet set and praised the director for the beautifully shot episode and the gorgeous image of roger and jane lying heads touching on the floor admitting their marriage just isn ’ t working while noting that the enemy of the season is the passage of time itself
verne gay of newsday called it a good but difficult episode saying the story lines were all parallel – it was even an anthology with each story mirroring the next bringing to mind that memorable scene when roger under the influence is looking in the mirror and told to look away
the themes of male @-@ female entanglement and disentangle and yes hair once again is a predominant metaphor
the themes of travel
of being a stranger in a strange land
of life on mars or in plattsburgh
of alienation pursuit and of a generation born during the holocaust amid the holocaust
tim goodman of the hollywood reporter said the lsd trip was handled brilliantly here with insight surprises unpredictability excellent humor and a really lovely smart ending and the image of jane and roger on the floor as an example of the visual excellence of the episode
time magazine writer nate rawlings compared the episode to a david lynch film and noted that all three stories also shared the thematic connection of the struggle between professional and work life
ign reviewer eric goldman praised the performances of john slattery and peyton list and said the episode took three of the show 's best characters and rocked their worlds in very different ways telling three separate stories that were all utterly involving and moving and delivering one of the show 's best episodes ever in the process
this show continues to operate on a level few other series could dream of

roger friedman of forbes called the lsd sequences with jane and roger to be so well @-@ written they were kind of transcendent
salon writer nellie engoron acclaimed the episode while pointing out that with this episode ’ s tilt of the seesaw back to the older generation from the flailing youngsters we ’ re reminded that while the <num> saw a cultural shift towards youth like a drunk no historical change walks a straight line
for all the claims that don and others have made that the “ kids ” increasingly hold the cards the real truth if we ’ re telling it is that older white guys like bert and roger never truly lost power even if they began to hide behind the scenes while fresh young faces took the public glory

the script was written by andré bormanis and the episode was directed by star trek voyager alumni roxann dawson
the episode was the first of the season for both bormanis and dawson
the episode is the second of a three @-@ part episode arc which started in the forge and concludes in kir 'shara
set in the <num> century the series follows the adventures of the first starfleet starship enterprise registration nx @-@ <num>
in this episode the vulcan government seek to make the enterprise leave orbit so they can attack a renegade faction of vulcans and afterwards the long @-@ standing enemy of the vulcans the andorians
meanwhile captain jonathan archer and commander t 'pol have been captured by the syrrannites and it is discovered that archer has the katra of surak
he has visions which lead him to find an ancient vulcan artefact called the kir 'shara as the group come under attack from the vulcans
elements of the plot of the episode were compared by executive producer to the protestant reformation with the vulcan high command representing the catholic church
the producers took care to cast actors in the roles of t 'pau and surak who looked similar to the actors who portrayed those parts in the original series
nielsen ratings for the first run of the episode saw a decrease from the first part of the trilogy down to <num>
<num> <num>
the critical response was mixed saying that whilst they were entertained by the episode there were several elements in the plot which were problematic
since the act is widely considered to be criminal by the vulcan authorities soval is summarily dismissed from the ambassadorial service
meanwhile captain archer and commander t 'pol are questioned by the syrrannites
after a short while t 'pol is taken to see her mother t 'les and the two disagree about the tenets of the group — the vulcan authorities call them extremists a term t 'les disagrees with
soon archer begins to see visions of an old vulcan and the dissidents determine that he had the katra of surak transferred into him via mind meld
v 'las now largely unopposed on the council becomes increasingly obsessed with decisively ending the syrrannite threat once and for all
he postpones his plans to bombard the encampment after delays in convincing enterprise to leave orbit
he contacts starfleet and the admiralty give commander tucker direct orders which he refuses to carry out directly
he attempts with assistance from soval to send a rescue shuttlepod to the forge but they are intercepted by vulcan patrol vessels
v 'las then finally orders vulcan warships to directly engage enterprise and soval suggests that they should retreat before they are severely damaged
a ritual is performed to transfer the katra into the mind of t 'pau but the attempt fails
archer continues to see surak who informs him that he must find the relic known as the kir 'shara
the vulcan military begin to bombard the complex
archer t 'pol and t 'pau remain behind to search for the relic and archer is able to use his knowledge to unlock a door to reveal it
as they exit t 'pol finds her mother but she soon dies after being seriously injured in the attack
on enterprise soval reveals that the vulcans despite the recent peace accord are preparing a pre @-@ emptive strike against the andorians and tucker orders an immediate course at maximum warp
show runner manny coto summed up these differences saying our vulcans lie our vulcans are monolithic our vulcans are not pacifistic
he sought to introduce a situation which he compared to the <num> @-@ century protestant reformation and wanted to include a vulcan character who would effectively be in the role of martin luther while the vulcan high command represented the catholic church
the episode saw the re @-@ casting of two roles which had previously appeared in episodes of the original series
these were the parts of t 'pau and surak
t 'pau made her first appearance in amok time where she was played by celia lovsky
for awakening kara zediker was cast in the role
zediker had previously appeared in the first season of <num> as elizabeth nash
surak had been played by barry atwater in the savage curtain but this role was taken by bruce gray for awakening
gray had previously portrayed admiral chekote in the next generation episode gambit and the deep space nine episode the circle
for both of these parts the producers attempted to cast actors who looked similar to the originals
robert foxworth reprises his role from the first part of the trilogy as administrator v 'las and joanna casidy had previously portrayed t 'les earlier in the season in the episode home
john rubinstein who appears in awakening as koval has previously appeared as a mazarite earlier in the series in the episode fallen hero and had appeared in the <num> 's an episode of voyager
gary graham returned as soval who he has portrayed throughout the series from the pilot episode onwards
director roxann dawson has previously portrayed b 'elanna torres in voyager and awakening marked the tenth episode of the series that she had directed
it was her only episode of season four and her last on enterprise
it was also writer andré bormanis first episode of the season who had previously written several episodes of the series as well as voyager
filming started on september <num> <year> and concentrated on enterprise ship scenes on the standing sets for the first two days
after that production moved to the cave sets which were dressed with vulcan artifacts
on the fourth day of production those artifacts were removed so that the same sets could use used to film the visions that archer has of surak
all exterior scenes in the vulcan desert @-@ like forge were shot on a soundstage
the final day of filming took place on october <num> when all the scenes set in the vulcan high command were filmed
these involved only foxworth graham and rubinstein as well as a handful of extras
the broadcast saw the episode come in fifth place during the timeslot with a nielsen rating of <num>
<num> <num>
this means that it was seen by <num>
<num> percent of all households and <num> percent of all of those watching television at the time of the broadcast
it gained higher ratings than the wb which aired re @-@ runs of what i like about you and grounded for life but was behind the other four major networks with nbc 's dateline winning the hour with ratings of <num>
<num> <num>
the ratings received by enterprise continued a downward trend in recent episodes with ratings of <num>
<num> <num> received by the previous episode
michelle erica green reviewing the episode for treknation was undecided about whether the main point of the episode where captain archer is expected to lead the vulcans back to their main path of logic was a wonderfully progressive concept or just regressive trek in which humans have all the answers
she thought that the change in soval 's opinions in this episode was difficult to accept and that the other members of the main cast didn 't get a great deal to do in the episode
however whilst she thought that awakening was a visual improvement over the forge she was reserving judgement until she had seen the third part of the trilogy
jamahl epsicokhan at his website jammer 's reviews thought that certain elements of the plot didn 't follow logical paths such as how archer found the kir 'shara in a few minutes when apparently the syrrannites had been looking for it for two years even though it sits in a chamber behind a door that practically announces important relic inside however he called the episode entertaining and gave it a score of three out of four
the first home media release of the forge was in the season four dvd box set of enterprise originally released in the united states on november <num> <year>

mole crickets are cylindrical @-@ bodied insects about <num> – <num> centimetres <num>
<num> – <num>
<num> in long with small eyes and shovel @-@ like forelimbs highly developed for burrowing
they are present in many parts of the world and where they have been introduced into new regions may become agricultural pests
mole crickets have three life stages eggs nymphs and adults
most of their life in these stages is spent underground but adults have wings and disperse in the breeding season
they vary in their diet some species are vegetarian mainly feeding on roots others are omnivores including worms and grubs in their diet while a few are largely predacious
male mole crickets have an exceptionally loud song they sing from a sub @-@ surface burrow that opens out into the air in the shape of an exponential horn
the song is an almost pure tone modulated into chirps
it is used to attract females either for mating or for indicating favourable habitats for them to lay their eggs
in zambia mole crickets are thought to bring good fortune while in latin america they are said to predict rain
in florida where scapteriscus mole crickets are non @-@ native they are considered pests and various biological controls have been used
gryllotalpa species have been used as food in west java vietnam and the philippines
<num> and <num>
<num> cm <num>
<num> and <num>
<num> in long as adults
they are adapted for underground life and are cylindrical in shape and covered with fine dense hairs
the head forelimbs and prothorax are heavily sclerotinised but the abdomen is rather soft
the head bears two threadlike antennae and a pair of beady eyes
the two pairs of wings are folded flat over the abdomen in most species the fore wings are short and rounded and the hind wings are membranous and reach or exceed the tip of the abdomen however in some species the hind wings are reduced in size and the insect is unable to fly
the fore legs are flattened for digging but the hind legs are shaped somewhat like the legs of a true cricket however these limbs are more adapted for pushing soil rather than leaping which they do rarely and poorly
the nymphs resemble the adults apart from the absence of wings and genitalia the wingpads become larger after each successive moult
cladistic analysis of mole cricket morphology in <year> identifies six tribes of which four were then new indioscaptorini scapteriscinae triamescaptorini gryllotalpellini and neocurtillini gryllotalpinae and two existing tribes scapteriscini and gryllotalpini are revised
the group name is derived straightforwardly from latin gryllus cricket and talpa mole
within these subfamilies genera include gryllotalpa gryllotalpella leptocurtilla neocurtilla † pterotriamescaptor indioscaptor scapteriscus neoscapteriscus triamescaptor † archaeogryllotalpoides † cratotetraspinus † marchandia † palaeoscapteriscops mole cricket fossils are rare
a stem group fossil cratotetraspinus is known from the lower cretaceous of brazil
two specimens of marchandia magnifica in amber have been found in the lower cretaceous of charente @-@ maritime in france
they are somewhat more abundant in the tertiary amber of the baltic and dominican regions impressions are found in europe and the american green river formation
mole crickets are not closely related to the pygmy mole crickets the tridactyloidea which are in the grasshopper suborder caelifera rather than the cricket suborder ensifera
the two groups and indeed their resemblance in form to the mammalian mole family talpidae with their powerful front limbs form an example of convergent evolution both developing adaptations for burrowing
the females typically take wing soon after sunset and are attracted to areas where males are calling which they do for about an hour after sunset
this may be in order to mate or they may be influenced by the suitability of the habitat for egg @-@ laying as demonstrated by the number of males present and calling in the vicinity
after mating there may be a period of one or two weeks before the female starts laying eggs
she burrows into the soil to a depth of <num> cm <num> in <num> cm <num> in has been seen in the laboratory and lays a clutch of <num> to <num> eggs
neoscapteriscus females then retire sealing the entrance passage but in gryllotalpa and neocurtilla species the female has been observed to remain in an adjoining chamber to tend the clutch
further clutches may follow over several months according to species
eggs need to be laid in moist ground and many nymphs die because of insufficient moisture in the soil
the eggs hatch in a few weeks and as they grow the nymphs consume a great deal of plant material either underground or on the surface
the adults of some species of mole cricket may move as far as <num> kilometres <num>
<num> mi during the breeding season
mole crickets are active most of the year but overwinter as nymphs or adults in cooler climates resuming activity in the spring
their main tunnels are used for feeding and for escape they can dig themselves underground very rapidly and can move along existing tunnels at high speed both forwards and backwards
their digging technique is to force the soil to either side with their powerful shovel @-@ like forelimbs which are broad flattened toothed and heavily sclerotised the cuticle is hardened and darkened
males attract mates by constructing specially @-@ shaped tunnels in which they sing
mating takes place in the male 's burrow the male may widen a tunnel to make room for the female to mount though in some species mating is tail @-@ to @-@ tail
females lay their eggs either in their normal burrows or in specially @-@ dug brood chambers which are sealed when complete in the case of the genus neoscapteriscus or not sealed in the case of genera gryllotalpa and neocurtilla
in gryllotalpa gryllotalpa the song is based on an almost pure tone at <num>
<num> kilohertz loud enough to make the ground vibrate <num> cm all round the burrow in fact the song is unique in each species
in gryllotalpa gryllotalpa the burrow is somewhat roughly sculpted in gryllotalpa vineae the burrow is smooth and carefully shaped with no irregularities larger than <num> millimetre
in both species the burrow takes the form of a double exponential horn with twin openings at the soil surface at the other end there is a constriction then a resonating bulb and then an escape tunnel
a burrow is used for at least a week
the male positions himself head down with his head in the bulb his tail near the fork in the tunnel
mole crickets stridulate like other crickets by scraping the rear edge of the left forewing which forms a plectrum against the lower surface of the right forewing which has a ratchet @-@ like series of asymmetric teeth the more acute edges face backwards as do those of the plectrum
the plectrum can move forwards with little resistance but moving it backwards makes it catch each tooth setting up a vibration in both wings
the sound @-@ producing stroke is the raising levation of the wings
the resulting song resembles the result of modulating a pure tone with a <num> hertz wave to form regular chirps
in g
vineae the wing levator muscle which weighs <num> milligrams can deliver <num>
<num> milliwatts of mechanical power g
gryllotalpa can deliver about <num> milliwatt
g
vineae produces an exceptionally loud song from half an hour after sunset continuing for an hour it can be heard up to <num> metres away
at a distance of <num> metre from the burrow the sound has a mean power over the stridulation cycle of up to <num> decibels the loudest recorded peak power was about <num> decibels at the mouths of the burrow the sound reaches around <num> decibels
g
gryllotalpa can deliver a peak sound pressure of <num> decibels and a mean of about <num> decibels
the throat of the horn appears to be tuned offering low inductive reactance making the burrow radiate sound efficiently the efficiency increases when the burrow is wet and absorbs less sound
mole crickets are the only insects that construct a sound @-@ producing apparatus
given the known sensitivity of a cricket 's hearing <num> decibels a night @-@ flying g
vineae female should be able to detect the male 's song at a range of <num> metres this compares to about <num> metres for a typical gryllus cricket that does not construct a burrow
the loudness of the song is correlated with the size of the male and the quality of the habitat both indicators of male attractiveness
the loudest males may attract <num> females in one evening when a quieter male may attract none
this behaviour enables acoustic trapping females can be trapped in large numbers by broadcasting a male 's song very loudly
as well as consuming roots underground mole crickets leave their burrows at night to forage for leaves and stems which they drag underground before consumption
the south american nematode steinernema scapterisci kills neocapteriscus mole crickets by introducing bacteria into their bodies causing an overwhelming infection
steinernema neocurtillae is native to florida and attacks native neocurtilla hexadactyla mole crickets
parasitoid wasps of the genus larra hymenoptera crabronidae attack mole crickets the female laying an egg on the external surface of the mole cricket and the larva developing externally on the mole cricket host
ormia depleta diptera tachinidae is a specialized parasitoid of mole crickets in the genus neoscapteriscus the fly 's larvae hatch from eggs inside her abdomen she is attracted by the call of the male mole cricket and deposits a larva or more on any mole cricket individual with which she comes in contact
specialist predators of mole cricket eggs in china and japan include the bombardier beetle stenaptinus jessoensis whereas in south america they include the bombardier beetle pheropsophus aequinoctialis coleoptera carabidae the adult beetle lays eggs near the burrows of mole crickets and the beetle larvae find their way to the egg chamber and eat the eggs
fungal diseases can devastate mole cricket populations during winters with sudden rises of temperature and thaws
the fungus beauveria bassiana can overwhelm adult mole crickets and several other fungal microsporidian and viral pathogens have been identified
mole crickets evade predators by living below ground and vigorously burrowing if disturbed at the surface
as a last @-@ ditch defence they eject a foul @-@ smelling brown liquid from their anal glands when captured they can also bite
they inhabit agricultural fields and grassy areas
they are present in every continent with the exception of antarctica by <year> one hundred and seven species had been described and more species are likely to be discovered especially in asia
neoscapteriscus didactylus is a widespread pest species originating in south america it has spread to the west indies and new south wales in australia
gryllotalpa africana is a major pest in south africa other gryllotalpa species are widely distributed in europe asia and australia
they are native to britain as to western europe but the former population of g
gryllotalpa may now be extinct in mainland britain surviving in the channel islands
the first @-@ detected invasive mole cricket species was neoscapteriscus didactylus a south american species reported as a pest in st
vincent west indies as early as <year> by <year> it was a major pest of agriculture in puerto rico
it had probably slowly expanded its range northwards island by island from south america
the only biological control program against n
didactylus was in puerto rico and it succeeded in establishing the parasitoid wasp larra bicolor from amazonian brazil
in <year> n
didactylus in puerto rico seemed to be a pest only in irrigated crops and turf
small scale experimental applications of the nematode steinernema scapterisci were made in irrigated turf but survival of the nematode was poor
very much later this same species was reported as a pest in queensland australia presumably arriving by ship or plane
the next @-@ detected invasive species was in the late <num> century in hawaii probably by ship
it was named as gryllotalpa africana but was probably g
orientalis
it attacked sugarcane and was targeted with larra polita from the philippines in <year> apparently successfully
the next detection was in georgia usa and at that time was assumed to be n
didactylus from the west indies
it was in fact three south american neoscapteriscus species n
abbreviatus n
vicinus and n
borellii probably arrived in ship ballast
they caused major problems for decades as they spread in the southeastern usa
scapteriscus mole cricket populations had built up since the early decades of the <num> century and damaged pastures lawns playing fields and vegetable crops
from the late <num> chordane had been the insecticide of choice to control them but when chordane was banned by the u
s
epa in the <num> ranchers were left with no economic and effective control method
especially to aid florida ranchers a project that became known as the uf ifas mole cricket research program was initiated in <year>
in <year> a multi @-@ authored report was published on accomplishments
in <year> an account was published on prospects for biological control and in <year> an account of promising results with biological control
the program ended in <year> after <num> years of running monitoring stations and in <year> a summary publication announced success a <num> reduction in mole cricket numbers in northern florida with biological control agents spreading potentially to all parts of florida
efforts to use larra bicolor as a biological control agent in florida began by importing a stock from puerto rico
it became established in a small area of southeastern florida but had little effect on neoscapteriscus populations
a stock from bolivia became established in northern florida and spread widely with some help to most of the rest of the state and neighboring states
its survival depends upon the availability of suitable nectar sources
once it was discovered that gravid female ormia depleta flies are attracted to the song of neoscapteriscus males in south america a path to trap these flies at synthetic mole cricket song was opened
experimentation then led to a rearing method
laborious rearing of over <num> @,@ <num> flies on mole cricket hosts allowed releases of living fly pupae at many sites in florida from the far northwest to the far south mainly on golf courses and mainly in <year> @-@ <year>
populations were established began to spread and were monitored by use of synthetic mole cricket song
eventually it was discovered that the flies had a continuous population from about <num> degrees north all the way south to miami but that the flies failed to survive the winter north of about <num> degrees
shipment and release of the flies to states north of florida was thus a wasted effort
as the flies had been imported from <num> degrees south in brazil and could not overwinter north of <num> degrees north in florida it was investigated in <year> whether flies from <num> degrees south in brazil might survive better in northern florida but they did not
the third biological control agent to target neoscapteriscus in florida was the south american nematode steinernema scapterisci
small @-@ scale releases proved it could persist for years in mole @-@ cricket @-@ infested sandy florida soils
its use as a biopesticide against neoscapteriscus was patented making it attractive to industry
industrial @-@ scale production on artificial diet allowed large @-@ scale trial applications in pastures and on golf courses which succeeded in establishing populations in several counties and these populations spread but sales were disappointing and the product was withdrawn from the market in <year>
as they tunnel through the top few centimetres of soil they push the ground up in little ridges increasing evaporation of surface moisture disturbing germinating seeds and damaging the delicate young roots of seedlings
they are also injurious to turf- and pasture @-@ grasses as they feed on the roots of the grasses leaving the plants prone to drying @-@ out and damage by use
in their native lands mole crickets have natural enemies that keep them under control
this is not the case when they have been accidentally introduced to other parts of the world
in florida they are considered pests and are described as a serious problem
a university of florida entomology report suggests that south american neoscapteriscus mole crickets may have entered the united states at brunswick georgia in ship 's ballast from southern south america around <year> but were at that time mistakenly believed to be from the west indies
one possible remedy is biological pest control using the parasitoidal wasps larra bicolor
another remedy that has been successfully applied is use of the parasitic nematode steinernema scapterisci
when this is applied in strips across grassland it spreads throughout the pasture within a few months and not only controls the mole crickets but remains infective in the soil for future years
in latin america scapteriscus and neocurtilla mole crickets are said to predict rain when they dig into the ground
in japan in the past they seem to have been associated with the worms corpses bugs that announce a persons sins to heaven in the koshin koushin belief — see the spirit ghoul shokera shoukera
in thailand mole crickets thai กระชอน are valued as food in isan
they are usually eaten fried along with sticky rice
in the philippines they are served as a delicacy called camaro in the province of pampanga and are a tourist attraction
they are also served in parts of northern luzon

with the french revolution into its fourth year civil war had spread across france between various rival political factions
napoleon was involved in military action on the government 's side against some rebellious cities of southern france
it was during these events in <year> that he spoke with four merchants from the midi and heard their views
as a loyal soldier of the republic he responded in turn set on dispelling the fears of the merchants and discouraging their beliefs
he later wrote about his conversation in the form of a pamphlet calling for an end to the civil war
with powerful members such as maximilien robespierre and georges danton the jacobin club a french political party established in <year> at the birth of the revolution managed to secure control of the government and pursue the revolution to their own ends culminating in a reign of terror
its repressive policies resulted in insurrection across much of france including the three largest cities after paris namely lyon marseille and toulon in the south of france
citizens in the south were opposed to a centralised government and to the decrees of its rule which resulted in rebellion
prior to the revolution france had been divided into provinces with local governments
in <year> the government the national constituent assembly reorganised france into administrative departments in order to rebalance the uneven distribution of french wealth which had been subject to feudalism under the monarchical ancien régime
on <num> july carteaux 's troops attacked rebellious national guardsmen killing several citizens during the siege before capturing the town and army supplies
afterwards napoleon travelled to nearby tarascon to find wagons with which to transport the munition
he visited beaucaire across the river from tarascon which had been holding an annual fair
napoleon arrived on <num> july the last day of the fair and went to a tavern where he shared supper and conversation with four merchants – two from marseille one from montpellier and another from nîmes
that evening napoleon and the four merchants discussed the revolution subsequent rebellions and their consequences
speaking as a pro @-@ republican napoleon supported the jacobin cause and explained the benefits of the revolution whilst defending carteaux 's actions in avignon
one of the merchants from marseille expressed his moderate views regarding the revolution and reasons for supporting civil war against a central government
the merchant stressed that marseille did not fight for the royalist cause but opposed the nature of the convention itself condemning its decrees and deeming the execution of citizens as unlawful
napoleon concluded that the people of marseille should reject counter @-@ revolutionary ideals and adopt the constitution of the french republic in order to end the civil war and allow the regular army to restore france
following their conversation the group drank champagne until two in the morning paid for by the marseillais merchant
the pamphlet was read by augustin robespierre brother of maximilien robespierre who was impressed by the revolutionary context
the pamphlet itself had little effect against the rebellious forces but served to advance napoleon 's career
he soon became recognised for his political ambitions by a corsica @-@ born politician and family friend christophe saliceti who arranged to have it published and distributed
christophe 's influence along with fellow convention deputy augustin robespierre advanced napoleon into the position of senior gunner at toulon
in memoirs of napoleon bonaparte a biography by napoleon 's private secretary louis de bourrienne he notes that le souper de beaucaire was reprinted as a book – the first edition issued at the cost of the public treasury in august <year> and a second edition in <year> following napoleon 's death
he also states it was during my absence from france that bonaparte in the rank of chef de bataillon major performed his first campaign and contributed so materially to the recapture of toulon
of this period of his life i have no personal knowledge and therefore i shall not speak of it as an eye @-@ witness
i shall merely relate some facts which fill up the interval between <year> and <year> and which i have collected from papers which he himself delivered to me
among these papers is a little production entitled le souper de beaucaire the copies of which he bought up at considerable expense and destroyed upon his attaining the consulate
in <num> the jurchens rebelled against their overlords the khitan liao dynasty <num> – <num> and declared the formation of the jin
allying with the song against their common enemy the liao the jin promised to return to the song the territories in northern china that had fallen under liao control since <num>
the jurchens quick defeat of the liao combined with song military failures made the jin reluctant to cede these territories
after a series of failed negotiations that embittered both sides the jurchens attacked the song in november <num> dispatching one army towards taiyuan and the other towards kaifeng the song capital
surprised by the news of an invasion the song general stationed in taiyuan retreated from the city which was besieged and later captured
as the second jin army approached the capital emperor huizong of the song abdicated and fled south
a new emperor qinzong was enthroned
the jurchens began a siege against kaifeng in <num> but qinzong negotiated for their retreat from the capital after he agreed to pay a large annual indemnity
qinzong reneged on the deal and ordered song forces to defend the prefectures instead of fortifying the capital
the jin resumed their war against the song and again besieged kaifeng in <num>
the chinese emperor was captured in an event known as the jingkang incident the capital was looted and the song lost northern china to the jin
remnants of the song retreated to southern china and after brief stays in several temporary capitals eventually relocated to hangzhou
the retreat of the song court marked the end of the northern song era and the beginning of the southern song
the jurchens tried to conquer southern china in the <num> but they were bogged down by a pro @-@ song insurgency in the north and a counteroffensive by the song generals yue fei han shizhong and others
the generals regained some territories but retreated on the orders of the southern song emperor who supported a peaceful resolution to the war
the treaty of shaoxing in <num> settled the boundary between the two empires along the huai river but conflicts between the two dynasties continued until the fall of the jin in <num>
a campaign against the song by the fourth jin emperor wanyan liang the prince of hailing was unsuccessful
he lost the battle of caishi <num> and was later assassinated by his own disaffected officers
an invasion of the jin motivated by song revanchism <num> – <num> was also unsuccessful
a decade later the jin launched an abortive military campaign against the song in <num> to compensate for the territory that they had lost to the invading mongols
the song formed an alliance with the mongols in <num> and in the following year jointly captured caizhou the last refuge of the jin emperor
the jin dynasty collapsed that year in <num>
after the demise of the jin the song dynasty itself became a target of the mongols and fell in <num>
the wars engendered an era of technological cultural and demographic changes in china
battles between the song and jin brought about the introduction of various gunpowder weapons
the siege of de 'an in <num> was the first recorded appearance of the fire lance an early ancestor of firearms
there were also reports of battles fought with primitive gunpowder bombs like the incendiary huopao or the exploding tiehuopao incendiary arrows and other related weapons
in northern china the jurchen tribes were the ruling minority of an empire that was predominantly inhabited by former subjects of the northern song
jurchen migrants settled in the conquered territories and assimilated with the local culture
the jin government instituted a centralized imperial bureaucracy modeled on previous chinese dynasties basing their legitimacy on confucian philosophy
song refugees from the north resettled in southern china
the north was the cultural center of china and its conquest by the jin diminished the international stature of the song dynasty
the southern song however quickly returned to economic prosperity and trade with the jin was lucrative despite decades of warfare
the capital of the southern song hangzhou expanded into a major city for commerce
many of the jurchen tribes were vassals of the liao dynasty <num> – <num> an empire ruled by the nomadic khitans that included most of modern mongolia a portion of north china northeast china northern korea and parts of the russian far east
to the south of the liao lay the han chinese song empire <num> – <num>
the song and liao were at peace but since a military defeat to the liao in <num> the song paid its northern neighbor an annual indemnity of <num> @,@ <num> bolts of silk and <num> @,@ <num> ounces of silver
in <num> the chieftain wanyan aguda <num> – <num> united the disparate jurchen tribes and led a revolt against the liao
in <num> he named himself emperor of the jin golden dynasty <num> – <num>
informed by a liao defector of the success of the jurchen uprising the song emperor huizong r
<num> – <num> and his highest military commander the eunuch tong guan saw the liao weakness as an opportunity to recover the sixteen prefectures a line of fortified cities and passes that the liao had annexed from the shatuo turk later jin in <num> and that the song had repeatedly but unsuccessfully tried to reconquer
the song thus sought an alliance with the jin against their common enemy the liao
because the land routes between the song and jin were controlled by the liao diplomatic exchanges had to occur by traveling across the bohai sea
negotiations for an alliance began secretly under the pretense that the song wanted to acquire horses from the khitans
song diplomats traveled to the jin court to meet aguda in <num> while jurchen envoys arrived in the song capital kaifeng the next year
at the beginning the two sides agreed to keep whatever liao territory they would seize in combat
in <num> aguda agreed to cede the sixteen prefectures to the song in exchange for transfer to the jin of the annual tributary payments that the song had been giving the liao
by the end of <num> however the jurchens had seized the liao supreme capital and offered the song only parts of the sixteen prefectures
among other things the jin would keep the liao western capital of datong at the western end of the sixteen prefectures
the two sides agreed that the jin would now attack the liao central capital whereas the song would seize the liao southern capital yanjing modern day beijing
the joint attack against the liao had been planned for <num> but it was rescheduled for <num>
in february <num> of that year the jin captured the liao central capital as promised
the song delayed their entry into the war because it diverted resources to fighting the western xia in the northwest and suppressing a large popular rebellion in the south
when a song army under tong guan 's command finally attacked yanjing in may <num> the smaller forces of the weakened liao repelled the invaders with ease
another attack failed in the fall
both times tong was forced to retreat back to kaifeng
after the first attack aguda changed the terms of the agreement and only promised yanjing and six other prefectures to the song
in early <num> it was jurchen forces that easily took the liao southern capital
they sacked it and enslaved its population
the quick collapse of the liao led to more negotiations between the song and the jin
jurchen military success and their effective control over the sixteen prefectures gave them more leverage
aguda grew increasingly frustrated as he realized that despite their military failures the song still intended to seize most of the prefectures
in the spring of <num> the two sides finally set the terms of the first song – jin treaty
only seven prefectures including yanjing would be returned to the song and the song would pay an annual indemnity of <num> @,@ <num> packs of silk and <num> @,@ <num> taels of silver to the jin as well as a one @-@ time payment of one million strings of copper coins to compensate the jurchens for the tax revenue they would have earned had they not returned the prefectures
in may <num> tong guan and the song armies entered the looted yanjing
the jurchens defeated his armies a few months later and zhang took refuge in yanjing
even though the song agreed to execute him in late <num> this incident put tension between the two states because the <num> treaty had explicitly forbidden both sides from harboring defectors
in <num> song officials further angered the jin by asking for the cession of nine more border prefectures
the new jin emperor taizong r
<num> – <num> aguda 's brother and successor hesitated but warrior princes wanyan zonghan and wanyan zongwang 完颜宗望 vehemently refused to give them any more territory
taizong eventually granted two prefectures but by then the jin leaders were ready to attack their southern neighbor
before they could invade the song the jurchens reached a peace agreement with their western neighbors the tangut western xia in <num>
the following year near the ordos desert they captured tianzuo the last emperor of the liao putting an end to the liao dynasty for good
ready to end their alliance with the song the jurchens began preparations for an invasion
the defection of zhang jue two years earlier served as the casus belli
two armies were sent to capture the major cities of the song
the song forces were not expecting an invasion and were caught off guard
the chinese general tong guan was informed of the military expedition by an envoy he had sent to the jin to obtain the cession of two prefectures
the returning envoy reported that the jurchens were willing to forgo an invasion if the song ceded control of hebei and shanxi to the jin
tong guan retreated from taiyuan and left command of his troops to wang bing
jin armies besieged the city in mid january <num>
under wang bing 's command taiyuan held on long enough to stop the jurchen troops from advancing to luoyang
it did not face much armed opposition
zongwang easily took yanjing where song general and former liao governor guo yaoshi 郭藥師 switched his allegiances to the jin
when the song had tried to reclaim the sixteen prefectures they had faced fierce resistance from the han chinese population yet when the jurchens invaded that area the han chinese did not oppose them at all
by the end of december <num> the jin army had seized control of two prefectures and re @-@ established jurchen rule over the sixteen prefectures
the eastern army was nearing kaifeng by early <num>
fearing the approaching jin army song emperor huizong planned to retreat south
the emperor deserting the capital would have been viewed as an act of capitulation so court officials convinced him to abdicate
there were few objections
rescuing an empire in crisis from destruction was more important than preserving the rituals of imperial inheritance
in january <num> a few days before the new year huizong abdicated in favor of his son and was demoted to the ceremonial role of retired emperor
the jurchen forces reached the yellow river on january <num> <num> two days after the new year
huizong fled kaifeng the next day escaping south and leaving the newly enthroned emperor qinzong r
<num> – <num> in charge of the capital
kaifeng was besieged on january <num> <num>
the commander of the jurchen army promised to spare the city if the song submitted to jin as a vassal forfeited the prime minister and an imperial prince as prisoners ceded the chinese prefectures of hejian taiyuan and zhongshan and offered an indemnity of <num> million taels of silver <num> million taels of gold <num> million packs of silk <num> million packs of satin <num> @,@ <num> horses <num> @,@ <num> mules <num> @,@ <num> cattle and <num> @,@ <num> camels
this indemnity was worth about <num> years of the annual tribute the song had been paying to the jin since <num>
with little prospect of help from afar arriving infighting broke out in the song court between the officials who supported the jin offer and those who opposed it
opponents of the treaty like li gang 李剛 <num> – <num> rallied around the proposal of remaining in defensive positions until reinforcements arrived and jurchen supplies ran out
they botched an ambush against the jin that was carried out at night and were replaced by officials who supported peace negotiations
the failed attack pushed qinzong into meeting the jurchen demands and his officials convinced him to go through with the deal
the song recognized jin control over the three prefectures
the jurchen army ended the siege in march after <num> days
an army of <num> @,@ <num> soldiers and another of <num> @,@ <num> were defeated by jin forces by june
a second expedition to rescue taiyuan was also unsuccessful
accusing the song of violating the agreement and realizing the weakness of the song the jin generals launched a second punitive campaign again dividing their troops into two armies
wanyan zonghan who had withdrawn from taiyuan after the kaifeng agreement and left a small force in charge of the siege came back with his western army
overwhelmed taiyuan fell in september <num> after <num> days of siege
when the song court received news of the fall of taiyuan the officials who had advocated defending the empire militarily fell from favor again and were replaced by counselors who favored appeasement
in mid december the two jurchen armies converged on kaifeng for the second time that year
neglecting the importance of the capital he left kaifeng defended with fewer than <num> @,@ <num> soldiers
the song forces were dispersed throughout china powerless to stop the second jurchen siege of the city
the jin assault commenced in mid december <num>
even as fighting raged on qinzong continued to sue for peace but jin demands for territory were enormous they wanted all provinces north of the yellow river
after more than twenty days of heavy combat against the besieging forces song defenses were decimated and the morale of song soldiers was on the decline
on january <num> <num> the jurchens broke through and started to loot the conquered city
emperor qinzong tried to appease the victors by offering the remaining wealth of the capital
the royal treasury was emptied and the belongings of the city 's residents were seized
the song emperor offered his unconditional surrender a few days later
qinzong the former emperor huizong and members of the song court were captured by the jurchens as hostages
they were taken north to huining modern harbin where they were stripped of their royal privileges and reduced to commoners
the former emperors were humiliated by their captors
they were mocked with disparaging titles like muddled virtue and double muddled
in <num> the jin made them perform a ritual meant for war criminals
the harsh treatment of the song royalty softened after the death of huizong in <num>
titles were granted to the deceased monarch and his son qinzong was promoted to duke a position with a salary
traditional accounts of song history held the venality of huizong 's imperial court responsible for the decline of the dynasty
these narratives condemned huizong and his officials for their moral failures
early song emperors were eager to enact political reforms and revive the ethical framework of confucianism but the enthusiasm for reforms gradually died after the reformist wang anshi 's expulsion as chancellor in <num>
corruption marred the reign of huizong who was more skilled as a painter than as a ruler
huizong was known for his extravagance and funded the costly construction of gardens and temples while rebellions threatened the state 's grip on power
a modern analysis by ari daniel levine places more of the blame on deficiencies in the military and bureaucratic leadership
the loss of northern china was not inevitable
the military was overextended by a government too assured of its own military prowess
huizong diverted the state 's resources to failed wars against the western xia
the song insistence on a greater share of liao territory only succeeded in provoking their jin allies
song diplomatic oversights underestimated the jin and allowed the unimpeded rise of jurchen military power
the state had plentiful resources with the exception of horses but managed its assets poorly during battles
unlike the expansive han and tang empires that preceded the song the song did not have a significant foothold in central asia where a large proportion of its horses could be bred or procured
as song general li gang noted without a consistent supply of horses the dynasty was at a significant disadvantage against jurchen cavalry the jin were victorious only because they used iron @-@ shielded cavalry while we opposed them with foot soldiers
it is only to be expected that our soldiers were scattered and dispersed
their intention was to weaken the song in order to demand more tribute and they were unprepared for the magnitude of their victory
the jurchens were preoccupied with strengthening their rule over the areas once controlled by liao
instead of continuing their invasion of the song an empire with a military that outnumbered their own they adopted the strategy of using chinese to control the chinese
the jin hoped that a proxy state would be capable of administering northern china and collecting the annual indemnity without requiring jurchen interventions to quell anti @-@ jin uprisings
in <num> the jurchens installed a former song official zhang bangchang 張邦昌 <num> – <num> as the puppet emperor of the newly established da chu great chu dynasty
the puppet government did not deter the resistance in northern china but the insurgents were motivated by their anger towards the jurchens looting rather than by a sense of loyalty towards the inept song court
a number of song commanders stationed in towns scattered across northern china retained their allegiance to the song and armed volunteers organized militias opposed to the jurchen military presence
the insurgency hampered the ability of the jin to exert control over the north
meanwhile one song prince zhao gou had escaped capture
he had been held up in cizhou while on a diplomatic mission and never made it back to kaifeng
he was not present in the capital when the city fell to the jurchens
the future emperor gaozong managed to evade the jurchen troops tailing him by moving from one province to the next traveling across hebei henan and shandong
the jurchens tried to lure him back to kaifeng where they could finally capture him but did not succeed
zhao gou finally arrived in the song southern capital at yingtianfu 應天府 modern shangqiu in early june <num>
for gaozong r
<num> – <num> yingtianfu was the first in a series of temporary capitals called xingzai 行在
the court moved to yingtianfu because of its historical importance to emperor taizu of song the founder of the dynasty who had previously served in that city as a military governor
the symbolism of the city was meant to secure the political legitimacy of the new emperor who was enthroned there on june <num>
after reigning for barely one month zhang bangchang was persuaded by the song to step down as emperor of the great chu and to recognize the legitimacy of the song imperial line
li gang pressured gaozong to execute zhang for betraying the song
the emperor relented and zhang was coerced into suicide
the killing of zhang showed that the song was willing to provoke the jin and that the jin had yet to solidify their control over the newly conquered territories
the submission and abolition of chu meant that kaifeng was now back under song control
zong ze 宗澤 <num> – <num> the song general responsible for fortifying kaifeng entreated gaozong to move the court back to the city but gaozong refused and retreated south
the southward move marked the end of the northern song and the beginning of the southern song era of chinese history
the descendant of confucius at qufu the duke yansheng kong duanyou fled south with the song emperor to quzhou while the newly established jin dynasty <num> – <num> in the north appointed kong duanyou 's brother kong duancao who remained in qufu as duke yansheng
zhang xuan 張選 a great @-@ grandson of zhang zai also fled south with gaozong
the jin renewed their attacks on the song and quickly reconquered much of northern china
in late <num> gaozong moved his court further south from yingtianfu to yangzhou south of the huai river and north of the yangtze river by sailing down the grand canal
the court spent over a year in the city
when the jurchens advanced to the huai river the court was partially evacuated to hangzhou in <num>
days later gaozong narrowly escaped on horseback just a few hours ahead of jurchen vanguard troops
after a coup in hangzhou almost dethroned him in may <num> he moved his capital back north to jiankang modern @-@ day nanjing on the south bank of the yangtze
one month later however zong ze 's successor du chong 杜充 vacated his forces from kaifeng exposing jiankang to attack
the emperor moved back to hangzhou in september leaving jiankang in du chong 's hands
the jin eventually captured kaifeng in early <num>
from <num> to <num> the song sent thirteen embassies to the jin to discuss peace terms and to negotiate the release of gaozong 's mother and huizong but the jin court ignored them
in december <num> the jin started a new military offensive dispatching two armies across the huai river in the east and west
on the western front an army invaded jiangxi the area where the song dowager empress resided and captured hongzhou 洪州 present @-@ day nanchang
they were ordered to retreat a few months later when the eastern army withdrew
meanwhile on the eastern front wuzhu commanded the main jin army
he crossed the yangtze southwest of jiankang and took that city when du chong surrendered
wuzhu set out from jiankang and advanced rapidly to try to capture gaozong
the jin seized hangzhou january <num> <num> and then shaoxing further south february <num> but general zhang jun 's <num> – <num> battle with wuzhu near ningbo gave gaozong time to escape
by the time wuzhu resumed pursuit the song court was fleeing on ships to islands off the coast of zhejiang and then further south to wenzhou
the jin sent ships to chase after gaozong but failed to catch him
they gave up the pursuit and the jurchens retreated north
after they plundered the undefended cities of hangzhou and suzhou they finally started to face resistance from song armies led by yue fei and han shizhong
the latter even inflicted a major defeat on jurchen forces and tried to prevent wuzhu from crossing back to the north bank of the yangtze
the small boats of the jin army were outmatched by han shizhong 's fleet of seagoing vessels
wuzhu eventually managed to cross the river when he had his troops use incendiary arrows to neutralize han 's ships by burning their sails
wuzhu 's troops came back south of the yangtze one last time to jiankang which they pillaged and then headed north
yet the jin had been caught off guard by the strength of the song navy and wuzhu never tried to cross the yangtze river again
in early <num> jin armies between the huai and the yangtze were repelled by bandits loyal to the song
zhang rong 張榮 the leader of the bandits was given a government position for his victory against the jin
after the jin incursion that almost captured gaozong the sovereign ordered pacification commissioner zhang jun <num> – <num> who was in charge of shaanxi and sichuan in the far west to attack the jin there to relieve pressure on the court
zhang put together a large army but was defeated by wuzhu near xi 'an in late <num>
wuzhu advanced further west into gansu and drove as far south as jiezhou 階州 modern wudu
the most important battles between jin and song in <num> and <num> took place in shaanxi gansu and sichuan
the jin lost two battles at heshan yuan in <num>
after failing to enter sichuan wuzhu retreated to yanjing
he returned to the western front again from <num> to <num>
the jin attacked hubei and shaanxi in <num>
wuzhu captured heshan yuan in <num> but his advance was halted by a defeat at xianren pass
he gave up on taking sichuan and no more major battles were fought between the jin and song for the rest of the decade
the song court returned to hangzhou in <num> and the city was renamed lin 'an
the imperial ancestral temple was built in hangzhou later that same year a sign that the court had in practice established hangzhou as the song capital without a formal declaration
it was treated as a temporary capital
between <num> and <num> the court would sporadically move to jiankang and back to hangzhou
there were proposals to make jiankang the new capital but hangzhou won out because the court considered it a more secure city
the natural barriers that surrounded hangzhou including lakes and rice paddies made it more difficult for the jurchen cavalry to breach its fortifications
access to the sea made it easier to retreat from the city
in <num> gaozong officially declared hangzhou the capital of the dynasty but the label of temporary capital would still be in place
hangzhou would remain the capital of the southern song for the next <num> years growing into a major commercial and cultural center
gaozong who considered himself a northerner initially rejected the proposal
there were gestures toward peace in <num> when the jin freed an imprisoned song diplomat and in <num> when the song offered to become a jin vassal but a treaty never materialized
the jin requirement that the border between the two states be moved south from the huai river to the yangtze was too large of a hurdle for the two sides to reach an agreement
the continuing insurgency of anti @-@ jin forces in northern china hampered the jurchen campaigns south of the yangtze
reluctant to let the war drag on the jin decided to create da qi the great qi their second attempt at a puppet state in northern china
the jurchens believed that this state nominally ruled by someone of han chinese descent would be able to attract the allegiance of disaffected members of the insurgency
the jurchens also suffered from a shortage of skilled manpower and controlling the entirety of northern china was not administratively feasible
in the final months of <num> liu yu 劉豫 <num> – <num> won the favor of the jin emperor taizong
liu was a song official from hebei who had been a prefect of jinan in shandong before his defection to the jin in <num>
da qi was formed late in <num> and the jin enthroned liu as its emperor
daming in hebei was the first capital of qi before its move to kaifeng former capital of the northern song
the qi government instituted military conscription made an attempt at reforming the bureaucracy and enacted laws that enforced the collection of high taxes
it was also responsible for supplying a large portion of the troops that fought the song in the seven years following its creation
the jin granted qi more autonomy than the first puppet government of chu but liu yu was obligated to obey the orders of the jurchen generals
with jin support da qi invaded the song in november <num>
li cheng a song turncoat who had joined the qi led the campaign
xiangyang and nearby prefectures fell to his army
the capture of xiangyang on the han river gave the jurchens a passage into the central valley of the yangtze river
their southward push was halted by the general yue fei
in <num> yue fei defeated li and retook xiangyang and its surrounding prefectures
later that year however qi and jin initiated a new offensive further east along the huai river
for the first time gaozong issued an edict officially condemning da qi
the armies of qi and jin won a series of victories in the huai valley but were repelled by han shizhong near yangzhou and by yue fei at luzhou 廬州 modern hefei
their sudden withdrawal in <num> in response to the death of jin emperor taizong gave the song time to regroup
the war recommenced in late <num> when da qi attacked the huainan circuits of the song
qi lost a battle at outang 藕塘 in modern anhui against a song army led by yang qizhong 楊沂中 <num> – <num>
the victory boosted song morale and the military commissioner zhang jun <num> – <num> convinced gaozong to begin plans for a counterattack
gaozong first agreed but he abandoned the counteroffensive when an officer named li qiong 酈瓊 killed his superior official and defected to the jin with tens of thousands of soldiers
meanwhile emperor xizong r
<num> – <num> inherited the jin throne from taizong and pushed for peace
he and his generals were disappointed with liu yu 's military failures and believed that liu was secretly conspiring with yue fei
in late <num> the jin reduced liu yu 's title to that of a prince and abolished the state of qi
the jin and song renewed the negotiations towards peace
yue fei han shizhong and a large number of officials at court criticized the peace overtures
aided by his control of the censorate qin purged his enemies and continued negotiations
in <num> the jin and song agreed to a treaty that designated the yellow river as border between the two states and recognized gaozong as a subject of the jin
but because there remained opposition to the treaty in both the courts of the jin and song the treaty never came into effect
a jurchen army led by wuzhu invaded in early <num>
the song counteroffensive that followed achieved large territorial gains
song general liu qi 劉錡 won a battle against wuzhu at shunchang modern fuyang in anhui
yue fei was assigned to head the song forces defending the huainan region
instead of advancing to huainan however wuzhu retreated to kaifeng and yue 's army followed him into jin territory disobeying an order by gaozong that forbade yue from going on the offensive
yue captured zhengzhou and sent soldiers across the yellow river to stir up a peasant rebellion against the jin
on july <num> <num> at the battle of yancheng wuzhu launched a surprise attack on song forces with an army of <num> @,@ <num> infantry and <num> @,@ <num> horsemen
yue fei directed his cavalry to attack the jurchen soldiers and won a decisive victory
he continued on to henan where he recaptured zhengzhou and luoyang
later in <num> yue was forced to withdraw after the emperor ordered him to return to the song court
emperor gaozong supported settling a peace treaty with the jurchens and sought to rein in the assertiveness of the military
the military expeditions of yue fei and other generals were an obstacle to peace negotiations
the government weakened the military by rewarding yue fei han shizhong and zhang jun <num> – <num> with titles that relieved them of their command over the song armies
han shizhong a critic of the treaty retired
yue fei also announced his resignation as an act of protest
in <num> qin hui had him imprisoned for insubordination
charged with treason yue fei was poisoned in jail on qin 's orders in early <num>
jurchen diplomatic pressure during the peace talks may have played a role but qin hui 's alleged collusion with the jin has never been proven
after his execution yue fei 's reputation for defending the southern song grew to that of a national folk hero
qin hui was denigrated by later historians who accused him of betraying the song
the real yue fei differed from the later myths based on his exploits
contrary to traditional legends yue was only one of many generals who fought against the jin in northern china
traditional accounts have also blamed gaozong for yue fei 's execution and submitting to the jin
qin hui in a reply to gaozong 's gratitude for the success of the peace negotiations told the emperor that the decision to make peace was entirely your majesty 's
by the terms of the treaty the huai river north of the yangtze was designated as the boundary between the two empires
the song agreed to pay a yearly tribute of <num> @,@ <num> taels of silver and <num> @,@ <num> packs of silk to the jin
the treaty reduced the southern song 's status to that of a jin vassal
the document designated the song as the insignificant state while the jin was recognized as the superior state
the text of the treaty has not survived in chinese records a sign of its humiliating reputation
the contents of the agreement were recovered from a jurchen biography
once the treaty had been settled the jurchens retreated north and trade resumed between the two empires
the peace ensured by the shaoxing treaty lasted for the next seventy years but was interrupted twice
one campaign was initiated by the song and the other by the jin
wanyan liang presented himself as a chinese emperor and planned to unite china by conquering the song
in <num> wanyan liang provided a casus belli by announcing that the song had broken the <num> peace treaty by acquiring horses
he instituted an unpopular draft that was the source of widespread unrest in the empire
anti @-@ jin revolts erupted among the khitans and in jin provinces bordering the song
wanyan liang did not allow dissent and opposition to the war was severely punished
the song had been notified beforehand of wanyan liang 's plan
they prepared by securing their defenses along the border mainly near the yangtze river but were hampered by emperor gaozong 's indecisiveness
gaozong 's desire for peace made him averse to provoking the jin
wanyan liang began the invasion in <num> without formally declaring war
jurchen armies personally led by wanyan liang left kaifeng on october <num> reached the huai river border on october <num> and marched in the direction of the yangtze
the song lost the huai to the jurchens but captured a few jin prefectures in the west slowing the jurchen advance
a group of jurchen generals were sent to cross the yangtze near the city of caishi south of ma 'anshan in modern anhui while wanyan liang established a base near yangzhou
the song official yu yunwen was in command of the army defending the river
the jurchen army was defeated while attacking caishi between november <num> and <num> during the battle of caishi
the paddle @-@ wheel ships of the song navy armed with trebuchets that fired gunpowder bombs overwhelmed the light ships of the jin fleet
jin ships were unable to compete because they were smaller and hastily constructed
the bombs launched by the song contained mixtures of gunpowder lime scraps of iron and a poison that was likely arsenic
traditional chinese accounts consider this the turning point of the war characterizing it as a military upset that secured southern china from the northern invaders
the significance of the battle is said to have rivaled a similarly revered victory at the battle of fei river in the <num> century
contemporaneous song accounts claimed that the <num> @,@ <num> song soldiers commanded by yu yunwen and tasked with defending caishi were able to defeat the invading jurchen army of <num> @,@ <num> soldiers
modern historians are more skeptical and consider the jurchen numbers an exaggeration
song historians may have confused the number of jurchen soldiers at the battle of caishi with the total number of soldiers under the command of wanyan liang
the conflict was not the one @-@ sided battle that traditional accounts imply and the song had numerous advantages over the jin
the song fleet was larger than the jin 's and the jin were unable to use their greatest asset cavalry in a naval battle
a modern analysis of the battlefield has shown that it was a minor battle although the victory did boost song morale
the jin lost but only suffered about <num> @,@ <num> casualties and the battle was not fatal to the jurchen war effort
it was wanyan liang 's poor relationships with the jurchen generals who despised him that doomed the chances of a jin victory
on december <num> wanyan liang was assassinated in his military camp by disaffected officers
he was succeeded by emperor shizong r
<num> – <num>
shizong was pressured into ending the unpopular war with the song and ordered the withdrawal of jin forces in <num>
emperor gaozong retired from the throne that same year
his mishandling of the war with wanyan liang was one of many reasons for his abdication
skirmishes between the song and jin continued along the border but subsided in <num> after the negotiation of a peace treaty
there were no major territorial changes
the treaty dictated that the song still had to pay the annual indemnity but the indemnity was renamed from tribute which had implied a subordinate relationship to payment
the song were informed of the jurchen predicament by their ambassadors who traveled twice a year to the jin capital and started provoking their northern neighbor
the hostilities were instigated by chancellor han tuozhou
the song emperor ningzong r
<num> – <num> took little interest in the war effort
under han tuozhou 's supervision preparations for the war proceeded gradually and cautiously
the court venerated the irredentist hero yue fei and han orchestrated the publishing of historical records that justified war with the jin
from <num> onwards song armed groups raided jin settlements
han tuozhou was designated the head of national security in <num>
the song funded insurgents in the north that professed loyalist sympathies
these early clashes continued to escalate partly abetted by revanchist song officials and war against the jin was officially declared on june <num> <num>
the document that announced the war claimed the jin lost the mandate of heaven a sign that they were unfit to rule and called for an insurrection of han chinese against the jin state
song armies led by general bi zaiyu 畢再遇 d
<num> captured the barely defended border city of sizhou 泗州 on the north bank of the huai river across from modern xuyi county but suffered large losses against the jurchens in hebei
the jin repelled the song and moved south to besiege the song town of chuzhou 楚州 on the grand canal just south of the huai river
bi defended the town and the jurchens withdrew from the siege after three months
by the fall of <num> however the jurchens had captured multiple towns and military bases
the jin initiated an offensive against song prefectures in the central front of the war capturing zaoyang and guanghua 光化 on the han river near modern laohekou
by the fall of <num> the song offensive had already failed disastrously
soldier morale sank as weather conditions worsened supplies ran out and hunger spread forcing many to desert
the massive defections of han chinese in northern china that the song had expected never materialized
a notable betrayal did occur on the song side however wu xi 吳曦 d
<num> the governor @-@ general of sichuan defected to the jin in december <num>
the song had depended on wu 's success in the west to divert jin soldiers away from the eastern front
he had attacked jin positions earlier in <num> but his army of about <num> @,@ <num> men had been repelled
wu 's defection could have meant the loss of the entire western front of the war but song loyalists assassinated wu on march <num> <num> before jin troops could take control of the surrendered territories
an bing 安丙 d
<num> was given wu xi 's position but the cohesion of song forces in the west fell apart after wu 's demise and commanders turned on each other in the ensuing infighting
fighting continued in <num> but by the end of that year the war was at a stalemate
the song was now on the defensive while the jin failed to make gains in song territory
the failure of han tuozhou 's aggressive policies led to his demise
on december <num> <num> han was beaten to death by the imperial palace guards
his accomplice su shidan 蘇師旦 was executed and other officials connected to han were dismissed or exiled
since neither combatant was eager to continue the war they returned to negotiations
a peace treaty was signed on november <num> <num> and the song tribute to the jin was reinstated
the song annual indemnity increased by <num> @,@ <num> taels of silver and <num> @,@ <num> packs of fabric
the treaty also stipulated that the song had to present to the jin the head of han tuozhou who the jin held responsible for starting the war
the heads of han and su were severed from their exhumed corpses exhibited to the public then delivered to the jin
they and other steppe nomads occasionally raided the jin empire from the northwest
the jin shied away from punitive expeditions and was content with appeasement similar to the practices of the song
the mongols formerly a jin tributary ended their vassalage in <num> and attacked the jin in <num>
in light of this event the song court debated ending tributary payments to the weakened jin but they chose to avoid antagonizing the jin
they refused western xia 's offers of allying against the jin in <num> and willingly complied when in <num> the jin rejected a request to lower the annual indemnity
meanwhile in <num> the jin retreated from the besieged capital of zhongdu to kaifeng which became the new capital of the dynasty
as the mongols expanded the jin suffered territorial losses and attacked the song in <num> to compensate for their shrinking territory
periodic song raids against the jin were the official justification for the war
another likely motive was that the conquest of the song would have given the jin a place to escape should the mongols succeed in taking control of the north
shi miyuan 史彌遠 <num> – <num> the chancellor of song emperor lizong r
<num> – <num> was hesitant to fight the jin and delayed the declaration of war for two months
song generals were largely autonomous allowing shi to evade blame for their military blunders
the jin advanced across the border from the center and western fronts
jurchen military successes were limited and the jin faced repeated raids from the neighboring state of western xia
in <num> the song generals meng zongzheng 孟宗政 and hu zaixing 扈再興 defeated the jin and prevented them from capturing zaoyang and suizhou
a second jin campaign in late <num> did marginally better than the first
in the east the jin made little headway in the huai river valley but in the west they captured xihezhou and dasan pass 大散關 modern shaanxi in late <num>
the jin tried to captured suizhou in jingxi south circuit again in <num> and <num> but failed
a song counteroffensive in early <num> captured sizhou and in <num> the jin cities of dengzhou and tangzhou were pillaged twice by a song army commanded by zhao fang 趙方 d
<num>
in the west command of the song forces in sichuan was given to an bing who had previously been dismissed from this position
he successfully defended the western front but was unable to advance further because of local uprisings in the area
the jin tried to extort an indemnity from the song but never received it
in the last of the three campaigns in early <num> the jin captured the city of qizhou 蘄州 in huainan west deep in song territory
song armies led by hu zaixing and li quan 李全 d
<num> defeated the jin who then withdrew
in <num> both sides agreed on a peace treaty that ended the annual tributes to the jin
diplomatic missions between the jin and song were also cut off
in <num> emperor aizong r
<num> – <num> of the jin dispatched diplomats to implore the song for supplies
jin envoys reported to the song that the mongols would invade the song after they were done with the jin — a forecast that would later be proven true — but the song ignored the warning and rebuffed the request
they instead formed an alliance with the mongols against the jin
the song provided supplies to the mongols in return for parts of henan
the jin dynasty collapsed when mongol and song troops defeated the jurchens at the siege of caizhou in <num>
general meng gong 孟珙 led the song army against caizhou
the penultimate emperor of the jin emperor aizong took his own life
his short @-@ lived successor emperor mo was killed in the town a few days later
the mongols later turned their sights towards the song
after decades of war the song dynasty also fell in <num> when the remaining song loyalists lost to the mongols in a naval battle near guangdong
constituting less than ten percent of the total population the two to three million ruling jurchens were a minority in a region that was still dominated by <num> million han chinese
the southward expansion of the jurchens caused the jin to transition their decentralized government of semi @-@ agrarian tribes to a bureaucratic chinese @-@ style dynasty
the jin government initially promoted an independent jurchen culture alongside their adoption of the centralized chinese imperial bureaucracy but the empire was gradually sinicized over time
the jurchens became fluent in the chinese language and the philosophy of confucianism was used to legitimize the ruling government
confucian state rituals were adopted during the reign of emperor xizong <num> – <num>
the jin implemented imperial exams on the confucian classics first regionally and then for the entire empire
the classics and other works of chinese literature were translated into jurchen and studied by jin intellectuals but very few jurchens actively contributed to the classical literature of the jin
the khitan script from the chinese family of scripts formed the basis of a national writing system for the empire the jurchen script
all three scripts were working languages of the government
jurchen clans adopted chinese personal names with their jurchen names
wanyan liang the prince of hailing r
<num> – <num> was an enthusiastic proponent of jurchen sinicization and enacted policies to encourage it
wanyan liang had been acculturated by song diplomats from childhood and his emulation of song practices earned him the jurchen nickname of aping the chinese
he studied the chinese classics drank tea and played chinese chess for recreation
under his reign the administrative core of the jin state was moved south from huining
he instated beijing as the jin main capital in <num>
palaces were erected in beijing and kaifeng while the original more northerly residences of jurchen chieftains were demolished
the emperor 's political reforms were connected with his desire to conquer all of china and to legitimize himself as a chinese emperor
the prospect of conquering southern china was cut short by wanyan liang 's assassination
wanyan liang 's successor emperor shizong was less enthusiastic about sinicization and reversed several of wanyan liang 's edicts
he sanctioned new policies with the intent to slow the assimilation of the jurchens
shizong 's prohibitions were abandoned by emperor zhangzong r
<num> – <num> who promoted reforms that transformed the political structure of the dynasty closer to that of the song and tang dynasties
despite cultural and demographic changes military hostilities between the jin and the song persisted until the fall of the jin
in the south the retreat of the song dynasty led to major demographic changes
the population of refugees from the north that resettled in hangzhou and jiankang modern nanjing eventually grew greater than the population of original residents whose numbers had dwindled from repeated jurchen raids
the government encouraged the resettlement of peasant migrants from the southern provinces of the song to the underpopulated territories between the yangtze and the huai rivers
the new capital hangzhou grew into a major commercial and cultural center
it rose from a middling city of no special importance to one of the world 's largest and most prosperous
during his stay in hangzhou in the yuan dynasty <num> – <num> when the city was not as wealthy as it had been under the song marco polo remarked that this city is greater than any in the world
once retaking northern china became less plausible and hangzhou grew into a significant trading city the government buildings were extended and renovated to better befit its status as an imperial capital
the modestly sized imperial palace was expanded in <num> with new roofed alleyways and in <num> with an extension of the palace walls
the loss of northern china the cultural center of chinese civilization diminished the international status of the song dynasty
after the jurchen conquest of the north korea recognized the jin not the song as the legitimate dynasty of china
the song 's military failures reduced it to a subordinate of the jin turning it into a china among equals
the song economy however recovered quickly after the move south
government revenues earned from taxing foreign trade nearly doubled between the closing of the northern song era in <num> and the final years of gaozong 's reign in the early <num>
the recovery was not uniform and areas like huainan and hubei that had been directly affected by the war took decades to return to their pre @-@ war levels
in spite of multiple wars the jin remained one of the main trading partners of the song
song demand for foreign products like fur and horses went unabated
historian shiba yoshinobu 斯波義信 b
<year> believes that song commerce with the north was profitable enough that it compensated for the silver delivered annually as an indemnity to the jin
there are reports that the fire lance one of the earliest ancestors of the firearm was used by the song against the jurchens besieging de 'an 德安 modern anlu in eastern hubei in <num> during the jin invasion of hubei and shaanxi
the weapon consisted of a spear attached with a flamethrower capable of firing projectiles from a barrel constructed of bamboo or paper
they were built by soldiers under the command of chen gui 陳規 who led the song army defending de 'an
the fire lances with which song soldiers were equipped at de 'an were built for destroying the wooden siege engines of the jin and not for combat against the jin infantry
song soldiers compensated for the limited range and mobility of the weapon by timing their attacks on the jin siege engines waiting until they were within range of the fire lances
later fire lances used metal barrels fired projectiles farther and with greater force and could be used against infantry
early rudimentary bombs like the huopao fire bomb 火礮 and the huopao 火砲 bombs propelled by trebuchet were also in use as incendiary weapons
the defending song army used huopao 火礮 during the first jin siege of kaifeng in <num>
on the opposing side the jin launched incendiary bombs from siege towers down onto the city below
in <num> huopao 火礮 were employed by the song troops defending de 'an and by the jin soldiers besieging the city
the government official lin zhiping 林之平 proposed to make incendiary bombs and arrows mandatory for all warships in the song navy
at the battle of caishi in <num> song ships fired pili huoqiu 霹靂火球 also called pili huopao bombs 霹靂火砲 from trebuchets against the ships of the jin fleet commanded by wanyan liang
the gunpowder mixture of the bomb contained powdered lime which produced blinding smoke once the casing of the bomb shattered
the song also deployed incendiary weapons at the battle of tangdao during the same year
gunpowder was also applied to arrows in <num> by a song army stationed in xiangyang
the arrows were most likely an incendiary weapon but its function may also have resembled that of an early rocket
at the jin siege of qizhou 蘄州 in <num> the jurchens fought the song with gunpowder bombs and arrows
the jin tiehuopao 鐵火砲 iron huopao which had cast iron casings are the first known bombs that could explode
the bomb needed to be capable of detonating in order to penetrate the iron casing
the song army had a large supply of incendiary bombs but there are no reports of them having a weapon similar to the jin 's detonating bombs
a participant in the siege recounted in the xinsi qi qi lu 辛巳泣蘄錄 that the song army at qizhou had an arsenal of <num> huopao 火礮 <num> incendiary gunpowder arrows for crossbows and <num> for bows as well as <num> pidapao 皮大礮 probably leather bags filled with gunpowder
its design was based on requirements for an assault gun issued by the armored force in <year> and it was built as an interim solution until a fully tracked design was complete
produced by the white motor company the vehicle was simply a <num> mm pack howitzer <num> mounted on a modified <num> half @-@ track
it was first used in combat in the north african campaign in november <year>
it later served in italy and france and possibly in the pacific
some were later leased to french forces and the type was used as late as the first indochina war in the <num>

the suspension consisted of vertical volute springs for the tracks and leaf springs for the wheels while the vehicle had a fuel capacity of <num> us gallons <num> l
it had a range of <num> mi <num> km and had a speed of <num> mph <num> km h and was powered by a white 160ax <num> hp <num> kw <num> in3 <num> @,@ <num> cc six @-@ cylinder gasoline engine with a compression ratio of <num>

it had a power @-@ to @-@ weight ratio of <num>

<num> in <num> mm pack howitzer
the <num> mm pack howitzer <num> as mounted could depress nine degrees elevate <num> degrees and traverse <num>
<num> degrees to each side
the vehicle had stowage for sixty rounds of <num> mm ammunition and although it was not designed for anti @-@ tank use it had a high explosive anti @-@ tank heat shell that could penetrate <num> in <num> mm of armor
the gun shield had <num>
<num> in <num>
<num> mm thick armor designed to stop a
<num> cal <num>
<num> mm bullet from <num> yards <num> m away
the ordnance department design was based on the <num> half @-@ track in order that it could be brought into service quickly
a prototype vehicle was authorized in october <year> armed with an m1a1 <num> mm pack howitzer and a mount that was designed to fit on a simple box structure in the back of an <num> half @-@ track
authorization for the production of two prototypes was given in january <year> first deliveries of the vehicle were made the following month from the white motor company
as it was seen as a temporary solution it was never given type classification
in september <year> the t30 was partially replaced by the howitzer motor carriage <num> the same gun on an <num> stuart
after that it was declared as limited standard
a total of <num> were produced all by the white motor company
in the 1st armored division each armored regiment was issued twelve t30s
of these three were used in each battalion headquarters platoon and three were used in each regimental reconnaissance platoon
in addition the <num> and 41st armored infantry regiments were each issued with nine t30 hmcs with three of them being allocated to the headquarters platoon in each armored infantry battalion
most infantry divisions in the north african campaign deployed a cannon company equipped with six t30s and two <num> mm t19 hmcs
in one encounter in north africa the t30 was used in an attempt to destroy german tanks
although the t30s fired several volleys the german tanks were barely damaged and the t30s were ordered to retreat under the cover of smoke to prevent losses
after several similar experiences u
s
forces ceased the practice of employing self @-@ propelled howitzers or mortars in direct combat with tanks
the t30 also served during the allied invasion of sicily in <year> the war in italy in <year> and possibly in the pacific
it was removed from infantry division use in march <year> following changes in the organization of us infantry battalions and was replaced by towed howitzers
the t30 was eventually replaced by the <num> hmc which was based on the <num> stuart light tank and which began entering service around the same time as the t30
only <num> t30 hmcs were delivered in their original configuration as the last <num> were converted back into <num> half @-@ tracks before they were delivered
later on the u

it was released in the united kingdom on <num> june <year> and in the united states a day later
the album was the first release on starbucks hear music label
it was produced by david kahne and recorded at abbey road studios henson recording studios air studios hog hill mill studios and rak studios between october <year> and from <year> to february <year>
in between the <year> and <year> sessions mccartney was working on another studio album chaos and creation in the backyard <year> with producer nigel godrich
memory almost full reached the top <num> in both the uk and us as well as denmark sweden greece and norway
the grammy @-@ nominated album has sold over <num> million copies worldwide and has been certified gold by the riaa for shipments of over <num> @,@ <num> copies just in the united states
the album was released in three versions a single disc a <num> @-@ cd set and a cd dvd deluxe edition the latter of which was released on <num> november <year>
a month later in october album sessions for memory almost full began and were produced by david kahne and recorded at abbey road studios
mccartney and the band recorded the songs you tell me only mama knows vintage clothes that was me feet in the clouds house of wax the end of the end and whole life
however the sessions were cut short and put on hiatus when mccartney started another album chaos and creation in the backyard with producer nigel godrich
in the website constructed for the album mccartney stated i actually started this album memory almost full before my last album chaos and creation in the backyard released september <year>

when i was just finishing up everything concerned with chaos and had just got the grammy nominations <year> i realised i had this album to go back to and finish off
so i got it out to listen to it again wondering if i would enjoy it but actually i really loved it
all i did at first was just listen to a couple of things and then i began to think ok i like that track – now what is wrong with it and it might be something like a drum sound so then i would re @-@ drum and see where we would get to

in places it 's a very personal record and a lot of it is retrospective drawing from memory like memories from being a kid from liverpool and from summers gone
the album is evocative emotional rocking but i can 't really sum it up in one sentence
any songs that were started but not finished for chaos and creation in the backyard mccartney didn 't want to re @-@ do for memory almost full
as sessions for the album progressed mccartney wrote some more songs something that mccartney used to do when he was in the beatles
a song called perfect lover was recorded at either one of the three following studios rak studios air studios or ocean way studios sometime between november <year> and april <year>
perfect lover in its original form was more folk @-@ like similar to chaos and creation in the backyard 's friends to go
perfect lover went through a minor lyrical change the bridge was changed and an overhaul of its musical arrangement before it finally became ever present past
two years after the <year> session sessions for the album started again
the book paul mccartney recording sessions <year> @-@ <year>
a journey through paul mccartney 's songs after the beatles reports that the recordings of the album were started in september – october <year> and resumed in february <year> at abbey road with other sessions taking place between march <year> and february <year>
new tracks were recorded at the following studios mccartney 's home studio in sussex the mill los angeles henson studios london 's rak studios and air studios and new york 's seesquared studios
the songs recorded at those studios were nod your head in private <num> gratitude mr
bellamy see your sunshine and ever present past
of those songs mr
bellamy ever present past gratitude nod your head and in private were all recorded on the same day in march <year>
as well as working on songs from the first memory almost full album session in <year> why so blue was re @-@ recorded
in total between <num> and <num> songs were recorded for the album
dance tonight was recorded along with feet in the clouds and <num> being reworked between january and february <year> at rak studios as the last song recorded for the album
the album was mixed by kahne and andy wallace
a day later producer david kahne stated on the same site that the leaked listing was bogus
in an interview with billboard magazine in may <year> mccartney said that the album 's material was in some ways a little bit retrospective
some of them are of now some of them hark back to the past but all of them are songs i 'm very proud of
mccartney played mandolin on the song dance tonight
he comments that in searching the instrument to try and find chords which i did with the guitar when i was <num> probably that freshness was brought back
ever present past which mccartney called personal originally started out as a song called perfect lover
ever present past also includes references to the beatles
in june <year> mccartney revealed that see your sunshine is pretty much an out @-@ and @-@ out love song for heather
a lot of the album was done before during and after our separation
i didn 't go back and take out any songs to do with her
you tell me is about mccartney 's memories of his previous wife linda
mr
bellamy the sixth song on the album was thought by online fans to be about mccartney 's then @-@ recent divorce
mccartney invited radiohead frontman thom yorke to play piano on the song but he declined
the press ran articles claiming that yorke had snubbed mccartney but yorke later revealed that he really liked the song but felt he would be unable to perform to the required standard
gratitude is reportedly about the divorce between heather mills and mccartney
the album features a five song @-@ medley which in an interview with billboard magazine mccartney said that it was previously something i wanted to revisit as nobody had been doing that for a while
the medley was a group of intentionally written material whereas mccartney had worked on the beatles abbey road which however was actually made up of bits we had knocking around
the medley starts off with vintage clothes which mccartney sat down one day to write that was looking back and looking back
about life
it was followed by the bass @-@ led that was me which is about his school days and teachers the medley as mccartney stated then progressed from there
the next songs are feet in the clouds about the inactivity while one is growing up and house of wax about the life of being a celebrity
the final song in medley the end of the end was written at mccartney 's cavendish avenue home while playing on his father jim 's piano
when asked if this was intentional mccartney replied some things are best left a mystery
in an interview with pitchfork media mccartney clarified i must say someone told me there is an anagram and i think it 's a complete mystery because it 's so complete
there does appear to be an anagram in the title
and it 's a mystery
it was not intentional
the album 's title was actually inspired by a message that came up on his mobile phone
he thought the phrase summed up modern life
a significant proportion of the cd release of memory almost full incorporated a cover insert whose top @-@ right corner was intentionally folded down to the center of the insert leaving the cd tray visible
the folded @-@ down white corner covers up the corner of the armchair image but has the artist and album names printed so that the text is complete despite the fold
upon opening and flattening out the cover insert the armchair is complete but the portion of the text which is printed on the folded @-@ down corner is not printed on the front of the cover leaving the text incomplete
this was the first time such an artistic intervention occurred within a standard jewel @-@ case and at first glance had the possibility of being viewed as a mis @-@ manufactured copy
mccartney on the cd case album artwork i really wanted to make the cd a desirable object
something that i know i 'd want to pick up from the shelf something that would make people curious
at metacritic the album earned an average score of <num> based on <num> reviews from critics which indicates generally favorable reviews
evan serpick of rolling stone magazine also compared the medley of five songs in the second part of the album to the famous song suite in the beatles abbey road
this album was ranked number <num> on rolling stone 's list of the top <num> albums of <year>
the recording contract with capitol emi ended a few months prior to the release of the album after mccartney had found out that emi were planning to take six months to set up a promotional plan for the album

imagine subsequently re @-@ entered the uk top <num> reaching number <num>
lennon later said the composition should be credited as a lennon ono song
a lot of it — the lyric and the concept — came from yoko but in those days i was a bit more selfish a bit more macho and i sort of omitted her contribution but it was right out of grapefruit
when asked about the song 's meaning during a december <year> interview with david sheff for playboy magazine lennon told sheff that dick gregory had given ono and him a christian prayer book which inspired him the concept behind imagine
the concept of positive prayer
if you can imagine a world at peace with no denominations of religion — not without religion but without this my god @-@ is @-@ bigger @-@ than @-@ your @-@ god thing — then it can be true
the world church called me once and asked can we use the lyrics to imagine and just change it to imagine one religion that showed me they didn 't understand it at all
it would defeat the whole purpose of the song the whole idea
with the combined influence of cloud piece and the prayer book given to him by gregory lennon wrote what author john blaney described as a humanistic paean for the people
blaney wrote lennon contends that global harmony is within our reach but only if we reject the mechanisms of social control that restrict human potential
in the opinion of blaney with imagine lennon attempted to raise people 's awareness of their interaction with the institutions that affect their lives
rolling stone 's david fricke commented lennon calls for a unity and equality built upon the complete elimination of modern social order geopolitical borders organised religion and economic class
lennon stated imagine which says imagine that there was no more religion no more country no more politics is virtually the communist manifesto even though i 'm not particularly a communist and i do not belong to any movement
he told nme there is no real communist state in the world you must realize that
the socialism i speak about
is not the way some daft russian might do it or the chinese might do it
that might suit them
us we should have a nice
british socialism
ono described the lyrical statement of imagine as just what john believed that we are all one country one world one people
rolling stone described its lyrics as <num> lines of graceful plain @-@ spoken faith in the power of a world united in purpose to repair and change itself
lennon composed imagine one morning in early <year> on a steinway piano in a bedroom at his tittenhurst park estate in ascot berkshire england
ono watched as he composed the melody chord structure and almost all the lyrics nearly completing the song in one brief writing session
described as a piano ballad performed in the soft rock genre the song is in the key of c major
its <num> @-@ bar piano introduction begins with a c chord then moves to cmaj7 before changing to f the <num> @-@ bar verses also follow this chord progression with their last <num> bars moving from am e to dm and dm c finishing with g g11 then g7 before resolving back to c
the <num> @-@ bar choruses progress from f to g to c then cmaj7 and e before ending on e7 a c chord substituted for e7 in the final bar
the <num> @-@ bar outro begins with f then g before resolving on c
with a duration of <num> minutes and <num> seconds and a time signature of <num> <num> the song 's tempo falls around <num> beats per minute
it was going to be john making a political statement but a very commercial one as well
i always thought that imagine was like the national anthem
lennon described his working arrangement with ono and spector phil doesn 't arrange or anything like that — ono and phil will just sit in the other room and shout comments like why don 't you try this sound or you 're not playing the piano too well
i 'll get the initial idea and
we 'll just find a sound from there
recording began at ascot sound studios lennon 's newly built home studio at tittenhurst park in may <year> with final overdubs taking place at the record plant in new york city during july
relaxed and patient the sessions began during the late morning running to just before dinner in the early evening
lennon taught the musicians the chord progression and a working arrangement for imagine rehearsing the song until he deemed the musicians ready to record
in his attempt to recreate lennon 's desired sound spector had some early tapings feature lennon and nicky hopkins playing in different octaves on one piano
he also initially attempted to record the piano part with lennon playing the white baby grand in the couple 's all @-@ white room
however after having deemed the room 's acoustics unsuitable spector abandoned the idea in favour of the superior environment of lennon 's home studio
they completed the session in minutes recording three takes and choosing the second one for release
the finished recording featured lennon on piano and vocal klaus voormann on bass guitar alan white on drums and the flux fiddlers on strings
issued by apple records in the united states in october <year> imagine became the best @-@ selling single of lennon 's solo career
it peaked at number three on the billboard hot <num> and reached number one in canada on the rpm national singles chart remaining there for two weeks
upon its release the song 's lyrics upset some religious groups particularly the line imagine there 's no heaven
when asked about the song during one of his final interviews lennon said he considered it to be as strong a composition as any he had written with the beatles
he described the song 's meaning and explicated its commercial appeal anti @-@ religious anti @-@ nationalistic anti @-@ conventional anti @-@ capitalistic but because it is sugarcoated it is accepted
now i understand what you have to do
put your political message across with a little honey
in an open letter to paul mccartney published in melody maker lennon said that imagine was working class hero with sugar on it for conservatives like yourself
on <num> november <year> the imagine lp reached number one on the uk chart
it became the most commercially successful and critically acclaimed album of lennon 's solo career

the next scene shows lennon sitting at a white grand piano in a dimly lit all @-@ white room
ono gradually walks around opening curtains that allow in light making the room brighter with the song 's progression
at the song 's conclusion ono sits beside lennon at the piano and they share a quaint gaze then a brief kiss

beatles producer george martin praised lennon 's solo work singling out the composition my favourite song of all was imagine
music critic paul du noyer described imagine as lennon 's most revered post @-@ beatles song
urish and bielen called it the most subversive pop song recorded to achieve classic status
fricke commented imagine is a subtly contentious song lennon 's greatest combined achievement as a balladeer and agitator
authors ben urish and ken bielen criticised the song 's instrumental music as overly sentimental and melodramatic comparing it to the music of the pre @-@ rock era and describing the vocal melody as understated
according to blaney lennon 's lyrics describe hypothetical possibilities that offer no practical solutions lyrics that are at times nebulous and contradictory asking the listener to abandon political systems while encouraging one similar to communism
author chris ingham indicated the hypocrisy in lennon the millionaire rock star living in a mansion encouraging listeners to imagine living their lives without possessions
others argue that lennon intended the song 's lyrics to inspire listeners to imagine if the world could live without possessions not as an explicit call to give them up
blaney commented lennon knew he had nothing concrete to offer so instead he offers a dream a concept to be built upon
blaney considered the song to be riddled with contradictions
its hymn @-@ like setting sits uncomfortably alongside its author 's plea for us to envision a world without religion
urish and bielen described lennon 's dream world without a heaven or hell as a call to make the best world we can here and now since this is all this is or will be
in their opinion because we are asked merely to imagine — to play a what if game lennon can escape the harshest criticisms
former beatle ringo starr defended the song 's lyrics during a <year> interview with barbara walters stating lennon said imagine that 's all
just imagine it
the morning after the november <year> paris attacks german pianist davide martello brought a grand piano to the street out in front of the bataclan where <num> concertgoers had been shot dead the night before and performed an instrumental version to honour the victims of the attacks video of his performance went viral
this led katy waldman of slate to ponder why imagine had become so frequently performed as a response to tragedy
in addition to its general popularity she noted its musical simplicity its key of c major the plainest and least complicated key with no sharps or flats aside from one passage with a plaintive major seventh chord that allows a tiny bit of e minor into the tonic
that piano part gentle as a rocking chair underpins lyrics that waldman says belongs to the tradition of hymns or spirituals that visualize a glorious afterlife without prophesizing any immediate end to suffering on earth
this understanding is also compounded by the historical context of lennon 's own violent death remind ing us that the universe can run ramshod over idealistic people
ultimately the song captures the fragility of our hope after a violent or destructive event
bu t also reveals its tenacity

however green received criticism for changing the lyric and no religion too to and all religions true resulting in an immediate backlash from fans who believed that he had disrespected lennon 's legacy by changing the lyrics of his most iconic song
green defended the change by saying it meant to represent a world where you could believe what you wanted
the event got media attention outside of the us with britain 's the guardian stating lennon 's original lyrics don 't praise pluralism or interchangeable religious truths – they damn them

it is spread mostly by insects known as triatominae or kissing bugs
the symptoms change over the course of the infection
in the early stage symptoms are typically either not present or mild and may include fever swollen lymph nodes headaches or local swelling at the site of the bite
after <num> – <num> weeks individuals enter the chronic phase of disease and in <num> – <num> it never produces further symptoms
the other <num> to <num> of people develop further symptoms <num> to <num> years after the initial infection including enlargement of the ventricles of the heart in <num> to <num> leading to heart failure
an enlarged esophagus or an enlarged colon may also occur in <num> of people
t
cruzi is commonly spread to humans and other mammals by the blood @-@ sucking kissing bugs of the subfamily triatominae
these insects are known by a number of local names including vinchuca in argentina bolivia chile and paraguay barbeiro the barber in brazil pito in colombia chinche in central america and chipo in venezuela
the disease may also be spread through blood transfusion organ transplantation eating food contaminated with the parasites and by vertical transmission from a mother to her fetus
diagnosis of early disease is by finding the parasite in the blood using a microscope
chronic disease is diagnosed by finding antibodies for t
cruzi in the blood
prevention mostly involves eliminating kissing bugs and avoiding their bites
other preventative efforts include screening blood used for transfusions
a vaccine has not been developed as of <year>
early infections are treatable with the medication benznidazole or nifurtimox
medication nearly always results in a cure if given early but becomes less effective the longer a person has had chagas disease
when used in chronic disease medication may delay or prevent the development of end – stage symptoms
benznidazole and nifurtimox cause temporary side effects in up to <num> of people including skin disorders brain toxicity and digestive system irritation
it is estimated that <num> to <num> million people mostly in mexico central america and south america have chagas disease as of <year>
in <year> chagas was estimated to result in <num> @,@ <num> deaths per year
most people with the disease are poor and most people with the disease do not realize they are infected
large @-@ scale population movements have increased the areas where chagas disease is found and these include many european countries and the united states
these areas have also seen an increase in the years up to <year>
the disease was first described in <year> by carlos chagas after whom it is named
it affects more than <num> other animals
the acute phase lasts for the first few weeks or months of infection
it usually occurs unnoticed because it is symptom @-@ free or exhibits only mild symptoms that are not unique to chagas disease
these can include fever fatigue body aches muscle pain headache rash loss of appetite diarrhea nausea and vomiting
the signs on physical examination can include mild enlargement of the liver or spleen swollen glands and local swelling a chagoma where the parasite entered the body
the most recognized marker of acute chagas disease is called romaña 's sign which includes swelling of the eyelids on the side of the face near the bite wound or where the bug feces were deposited or accidentally rubbed into the eye
rarely young children or adults may die from the acute disease due to severe inflammation infection of the heart muscle myocarditis or brain meningoencephalitis
the acute phase also can be severe in people with weakened immune systems
if symptoms develop during the acute phase they usually resolve spontaneously within three to eight weeks in approximately <num> of individuals
although the symptoms resolve even with treatment the infection persists and enters a chronic phase
of individuals with chronic chagas disease <num> – <num> will never develop symptoms called indeterminate chronic chagas disease while the remaining <num> – <num> will develop life @-@ threatening heart and or digestive disorders during their lifetime called determinate chronic chagas disease
in <num> of individuals the disease progresses directly from the acute form to a symptomatic clinical form of chronic chagas disease
the symptomatic determinate chronic stage affects the nervous system digestive system and heart
about two @-@ thirds of people with chronic symptoms have cardiac damage including dilated cardiomyopathy which causes heart rhythm abnormalities and may result in sudden death
about one @-@ third of patients go on to develop digestive system damage resulting in dilation of the digestive tract megacolon and megaesophagus accompanied by severe weight loss
swallowing difficulties secondary achalasia may be the first symptom of digestive disturbances and may lead to malnutrition
<num> to <num> of individuals with intestinal involvement also exhibit cardiac involvement
up to <num> of chronically infected individuals develop neuritis that results in altered tendon reflexes and sensory impairment
isolated cases exhibit central nervous system involvement including dementia confusion chronic encephalopathy and sensory and motor deficits
the clinical manifestations of chagas disease are due to cell death in the target tissues that occurs during the infective cycle by sequentially inducing an inflammatory response cellular lesions and fibrosis
for example intracellular amastigotes destroy the intramural neurons of the autonomic nervous system in the intestine and heart leading to megaintestine and heart aneurysms respectively
if left untreated chagas disease can be fatal in most cases due to heart muscle damage
a triatomine becomes infected with t
cruzi by feeding on the blood of an infected person or animal
during the day triatomines hide in crevices in the walls and roofs
the bugs emerge at night when the inhabitants are sleeping
because they tend to feed on people 's faces triatomine bugs are also known as kissing bugs
after they bite and ingest blood they defecate on the person
triatomines pass t
cruzi parasites called trypomastigotes in feces left near the site of the bite wound
scratching the site of the bite causes the trypomastigotes to enter the host through the wound or through intact mucous membranes such as the conjunctiva
once inside the host the trypomastigotes invade cells where they differentiate into intracellular amastigotes
the amastigotes multiply by binary fission and differentiate into trypomastigotes which are then released into the bloodstream
this cycle is repeated in each newly infected cell
replication resumes only when the parasites enter another cell or are ingested by another vector
see also life cycle and transmission of t
cruzi dense vegetation such as that of tropical rainforests and urban habitats are not ideal for the establishment of the human transmission cycle
however in regions where the sylvatic habitat and its fauna are thinned by economic exploitation and human habitation such as in newly deforested areas piassava palm culture areas and some parts of the amazon region a human transmission cycle may develop as the insects search for new food sources
t
cruzi can also be transmitted through blood transfusions
with the exception of blood derivatives such as fractionated antibodies all blood components are infective
the parasite remains viable at <num> ° c for at least <num> days or up to <num> days when kept at room temperature
it is unclear whether t
cruzi can be transmitted through frozen @-@ thawed blood components
other modes of transmission include organ transplantation through breast milk and by accidental laboratory exposure
chagas disease can also be spread congenitally from a pregnant woman to her baby through the placenta and accounts for approximately <num> of stillborn deaths in parts of brazil
oral transmission is an unusual route of infection but has been described
in <year> farm workers in the state of paraíba brazil were infected by eating contaminated food transmission has also occurred via contaminated açaí palm fruit juice and garapa
a <year> outbreak in <num> venezuelan school children was attributed to contaminated guava juice
chagas disease is a growing problem in europe because the majority of cases with chronic infection are asymptomatic and because of migration from latin america
cruzi is diagnostic of chagas disease
it can be detected by microscopic examination of fresh anticoagulated blood or its buffy coat for motile parasites or by preparation of thin and thick blood smears stained with giemsa for direct visualization of parasites
microscopically t
cruzi can be confused with trypanosoma rangeli which is not known to be pathogenic in humans
isolation of t
cruzi can occur by inoculation into mice by culture in specialized media for example nnn lit and by xenodiagnosis where uninfected reduviidae bugs are fed on the patient 's blood and their gut contents examined for parasites
various immunoassays for t
cruzi are available and can be used to distinguish among strains zymodemes of t
cruzi with divergent pathogenicities
these tests include detecting complement fixation indirect hemagglutination indirect fluorescence assays radioimmunoassays and elisa
alternatively diagnosis and strain identification can be made using polymerase chain reaction pcr
prevention is generally focused on decreasing the numbers of the insect that spreads it triatoma and decreasing their contact with humans
this is done by using sprays and paints containing insecticides synthetic pyrethroids and improving housing and sanitary conditions in rural areas
for urban dwellers spending vacations and camping out in the wilderness or sleeping at hostels or mud houses in endemic areas can be dangerous a mosquito net is recommended
some measures of vector control include a yeast trap can be used for monitoring infestations of certain species of triatomine bugs triatoma sordida triatoma brasiliensis triatoma pseudomaculata and panstrongylus megistus
promising results were gained with the treatment of vector habitats with the fungus beauveria bassiana
targeting the symbionts of triatominae through paratransgenesis can be done
a number of potential vaccines are currently being tested
vaccination with trypanosoma rangeli has produced positive results in animal models
more recently the potential of dna vaccines for immunotherapy of acute and chronic chagas disease is being tested by several research groups
blood transfusion was formerly the second @-@ most common mode of transmission for chagas disease but the development and implementation of blood bank screening tests has dramatically reduced this risk in the 21st century
blood donations in all endemic latin american countries undergo chagas screening and testing is expanding in countries such as france spain and the united states that have significant or growing populations of immigrants from endemic areas
in spain donors are evaluated with a questionnaire to identify individuals at risk of chagas exposure for screening tests
the us fda has approved two chagas tests including one approved in april <year> and has published guidelines that recommend testing of all donated blood and tissue products
while these tests are not required in us an estimated <num> – <num> of the blood supply is currently tested for chagas including all units collected by the american red cross which accounts for <num> of the u
s
blood supply
the chagas biovigilance network reports current incidents of chagas @-@ positive blood products in the united states as reported by labs using the screening test approved by the fda in <year>
management uniquely involves addressing selective incremental failure of the parasympathetic nervous system
autonomic disease imparted by chagas may eventually result in megaesophagus megacolon and accelerated dilated cardiomyopathy
the mechanisms that explain why chagas targets the parasympathetic autonomic nervous system and spares the sympathetic autonomic nervous system remain poorly understood
drugs of choice include azole or nitro derivatives such as benznidazole or nifurtimox
both agents are limited in their capacity to completely eliminate t
cruzi from the body parasitologic cure especially in chronically infected patients and resistance to these drugs has been reported
studies suggest antiparasitic treatment leads to parasitological cure in more than <num> of infants but only about <num> – <num> of adults treated in the first year of acute phase chagas disease
children aged six to <num> years with chronic disease have a cure rate of about <num> with benznidazole
while the rate of cure declines the longer an adult has been infected with chagas treatment with benznidazole has been shown to slow the onset of heart disease in adults with chronic chagas infections
treatment of chronic infection in women prior to or during pregnancy does not appear to reduce the probability the disease will be passed on to the infant
likewise it is unclear whether prophylactic treatment of chronic infection is beneficial in persons who will undergo immunosuppression for example organ transplant recipients or in persons who are already immunosuppressed for example those with hiv infection
for example pacemakers and medications for irregular heartbeats such as the anti @-@ arrhythmia drug amiodarone may be life saving for some patients with chronic cardiac disease while surgery may be required for megaintestine
the disease cannot be cured in this phase however
chronic heart disease caused by chagas disease is now a common reason for heart transplantation surgery
until recently however chagas disease was considered a contraindication for the procedure since the heart damage could recur as the parasite was expected to seize the opportunity provided by the immunosuppression that follows surgery
an estimated <num> @,@ <num> new cases occur annually in endemic countries and <num> @,@ <num> infants are born with congenital chagas disease annually
in <year> it resulted in approximately <num> @,@ <num> deaths up from <num> @,@ <num> in <year>
the disease is present in <num> countries on the american continents ranging from the southern united states to northern argentina
chagas exists in two different ecological zones
in the southern cone region the main vector lives in and around human homes
in central america and mexico the main vector species lives both inside dwellings and in uninhabited areas
in both zones chagas occurs almost exclusively in rural areas where triatomines breed and feed on the more than <num> species from <num> families of domestic and wild mammals as well as humans that are the natural reservoirs of t
cruzi
although triatominae bugs feed on them birds appear to be immune to infection and therefore are not considered to be a t
cruzi reservoir
even when colonies of insects are eradicated from a house and surrounding domestic animal shelters they can re @-@ emerge from plants or animals that are part of the ancient sylvatic referring to wild animals infection cycle
this is especially likely in zones with mixed open savannah with clumps of trees interspersed by human habitation
the primary wildlife reservoirs for trypanosoma cruzi in the united states include opossums raccoons armadillos squirrels woodrats and mice
opossums are particularly important as reservoirs because the parasite can complete its life cycle in the anal glands of this animal without having to re @-@ enter the insect vector
recorded prevalence of the disease in opossums in the u
s
ranges from <num>
<num> to <num>
<num>
studies on raccoons in the southeast have yielded infection rates ranging from <num> to as low as <num>
<num>
armadillo prevalence studies have been described in louisiana and range from a low of <num>
<num> to <num>
<num>
additionally small rodents including squirrels mice and rats are important in the sylvatic transmission cycle because of their importance as bloodmeal sources for the insect vectors
a texas study revealed <num>
<num> percent t
cruzi prevalence in <num> specimens representing four separate small rodent species
chronic chagas disease remains a major health problem in many latin american countries despite the effectiveness of hygienic and preventive measures such as eliminating the transmitting insects
however several landmarks have been achieved in the fight against it in latin america including a reduction by <num> of the incidence of human infection in children and young adults in the countries of the southern cone initiative and at least three countries uruguay in <year> and chile in <year> and brazil in <year> have been certified free of vectorial and transfusional transmission
in argentina vectorial transmission has been interrupted in <num> of the <num> endemic provinces and major progress toward this goal has also been made in both paraguay and bolivia
screening of donated blood blood components and solid organ donors as well as donors of cells tissues and cell and tissue products for t
cruzi is mandated in all chagas @-@ endemic countries and has been implemented
approximately <num> @,@ <num> infected people live in the united states which is likely the result of immigration from latin american countries and there have been only <num> human cases of domestically acquired vector @-@ borne chagas disease reported between <year> and <year>
with increased population movements the possibility of transmission by blood transfusion became more substantial in the united states
transfusion blood and tissue products are now actively screened in the u
s
thus addressing and minimizing this risk
the disease was not seen as a major public health problem in humans until the <num> the outbreak of chagas disease in brazil in the <num> went widely ignored
dr chagas discovered that the intestines of triatomidae now reduviidae triatominae harbored a flagellate protozoan a new species of the trypanosoma genus and was able to demonstrate experimentally that it could be transmitted to marmoset monkeys that were bitten by the infected bug
later studies showed squirrel monkeys were also vulnerable to infection
chagas named the pathogenic parasite as trypanosoma cruzi and later that year as schizotrypanum cruzi both honoring oswaldo cruz the noted brazilian physician and epidemiologist who successfully fought epidemics of yellow fever smallpox and bubonic plague in rio de janeiro and other cities in the beginning of the <num> century
chagas was also the first to unknowingly discover and illustrate the parasitic fungal genus pneumocystis later infamously linked to pcp pneumocystis pneumonia in aids victims
confusion between the two pathogens life @-@ cycles led him to briefly recognize his genus schizotrypanum but following the description of pneumocystis by others as an independent genus chagas returned to the use of the name trypanosoma cruzi
in argentina the disease is known as mal de chagas @-@ mazza in honor of salvador mazza the argentine physician who in <year> began investigating the disease and over the years became the principal researcher of this disease in the country
mazza produced the first scientific confirmation of the existence of trypanosoma cruzi in argentina in <year> eventually leading to support from local and european medical schools and argentine government policy makers
it has been hypothesized that charles darwin might have suffered from chagas disease as a result of a bite of the so @-@ called great black bug of the pampas vinchuca see charles darwin 's illness
the episode was reported by darwin in his diaries of the voyage of the beagle as occurring in march <year> to the east of the andes near mendoza
darwin was young and generally in good health though six months previously he had been ill for a month near valparaiso but in <year> almost a year after he returned to england he began to suffer intermittently from a strange group of symptoms becoming incapacitated for much of the rest of his life
attempts to test darwin 's remains at westminster abbey by using modern pcr techniques were met with a refusal by the abbey 's curator
these include inhibitors of oxidosqualene cyclase and squalene synthase cysteine protease inhibitors dermaseptins collected from frogs in the genus phyllomedusa p
oreades and p
distincta the sesquiterpene lactone dehydroleucodine dhl which affects the growth of cultured epimastigote @-@ phase trypanosoma cruzi inhibitors of purine uptake and inhibitors of enzymes involved in trypanothione metabolism
hopefully new drug targets may be revealed following the sequencing of the t
cruzi genome
chagas disease has a serious economic impact on the united states and the world
the cost of treatment in the united states alone where the disease is not indigenous is estimated to be <num> million annually which includes hospitalization and medical devices such as pacemakers
the global cost is estimated at <num> billion
megazol in a study seems more active against chagas than benznidazole but has not been studied in humans
fexinidazole an old drug rediscovered for this purpose is being tested in phase <num> clinical trials
a chagas vaccine tcvac3 has been found to be effective in mice with plans for studies in dogs
it is hoped that it will be commercially available by <year>
it is found in the coastal waters of the eastern pacific ocean from southern california to northern chile and around the galápagos and hawaiian islands
this bottom @-@ dweller generally inhabits sandy or muddy flats near rocky reefs and kelp forests to a depth of <num> m <num> ft though off hawaii it may range considerably deeper
as its common name suggests this species has an angular diamond @-@ shaped pectoral fin disc that is plain brown or gray above with rows of tubercles along the midline and on the shoulders
the long whip @-@ like tail has both dorsal and ventral fin folds which distinguish this ray from the closely similar longtail stingray d
longa
it typically grows to <num> m <num>
<num> ft across
when searching for food diamond stingrays may form groups of up to hundreds of individuals
it is most active at night and preys mainly on burrowing invertebrates and small bony fishes which are extracted from the bottom via suction or digging
this species is aplacental viviparous once the embryos exhaust their yolk supply they are nourished by histotroph uterine milk produced by the mother
females bear <num> – <num> pups every summer in estuaries mating is followed by a ten @-@ month period of either sperm storage or arrested embryonic development after which the embryos rapidly mature over <num> – <num> months
the slowest @-@ growing stingray known this species is not resilient against fishing pressure
it is caught for food by artisanal fishers in latin america particularly in mexico where it is one of the most economically important rays
this has led it to be assessed as near threatened in mexico by the international union for conservation of nature iucn while the species as a whole is listed as data deficient
though innocuous towards humans the diamond stingray 's long venomous tail spine is potentially dangerous
jordan and gilbert 's account was published in may while garman 's was published in october making dipterurus feminine dipterura the correct name as it was published first
however when garman synonymized the two in <year> he inappropriately gave precedence to brevis leading to long @-@ standing confusion
both dasybatus and trygon were later synonymized with the genus dasyatis but many authors still listed d
brevis in place of or in addition to d
dipterura
garman also synonymized the hawaiian stingray d
hawaiensis with d
dipterura in <year> which has since been followed by most authors but requires more study for confirmation
the species syntypes were collected from san diego bay california
the specific epithet dipterura is derived from the latin di two ptero wing and ura tail referring to the fin folds on both sides of its tail
rat @-@ tailed stingray is a former common name for this species
lisa rosenberger 's <year> phylogenetic analysis based on morphology determined the diamond stingray and the bluntnose stingray d
say of the western atlantic ocean to be sister species that likely diverged before or with the formation of the isthmus of panama c
<num> ma
in addition the two were found to be the second @-@ most basal taxa in their genus after the common stingray d
pastinaca
at the northern and southern extremes of its range it is generally only present during periods of suitably warm water brought about by el niño
there is a record of this ray from off british columbia which is unconfirmed and would be highly anomalous as it is known to be a tropical and warm @-@ temperate species
a bottom @-@ dwelling inhabitant of inshore waters the diamond stingray favors sandy or muddy bottoms often near rocky reefs or kelp forests
off southern california it usually occurs from the intertidal zone to a depth of <num> m <num> ft during the summer shifting to depths of <num> – <num> m <num> – <num> ft during late fall and winter
for unknown reasons it prefers to overwinter in kelp forests rather than sandy flats
off chile the diamond stingray occurs at a similar depth of <num> – <num> m <num> – <num> ft
on the other hand this species has been reported from as far down as <num> m <num> @,@ <num> ft off hawaii which if accurate would suggest that it utilizes a much greater range of depths than previously realized
<num> ft or possibly <num>
<num> m <num>
<num> ft females grow larger than males
its pectoral fin disc is rhomboid in shape slightly wider than long with angular outer corners and subtly convex margins
the snout is blunt @-@ angled and non @-@ projecting
the eyes are fairly large and immediately followed by the spiracles paired respiratory openings
the mouth is strongly curved containing <num> – <num> upper tooth rows and <num> – <num> lower tooth rows the teeth are small and blunt and arranged into flattened surfaces
three or five papillae nipple @-@ like structures are found in a row across the floor of the mouth
the whip @-@ like tail generally measures up to one and half times the length of the disc and bears one more if replacements have grown in long slender serrated spine on the upper surface closer to the base than the tip
behind the spine there are long dorsal and ventral fin folds that rise gradually reaching a relatively high apex before sloping down abruptly
the presence of the upper fin fold separates this species from the similar longtail stingray d
longa which shares most of its range
however the tail is often damaged in which case differentiating the two species in the field becomes all but impossible
young rays have completely smooth skin while adults develop a row of low tubercles along the midline of the back flanked by two shorter rows on the shoulders
the tail also becomes covered in prickles
this species is a uniform olive to brown to gray above darkening to black on the tail and off @-@ white below
when foraging for food it may be solitary but more commonly forms groups numbering up to the hundreds
there is strong segregation by sex and age
this species feeds on crustaceans molluscs and other invertebrates as well as small bony fishes its powerful jaws and molar @-@ like teeth allow it to crush hard @-@ shelled prey
it mainly targets burrowing organisms but may also take prey exposed on the bottom
there is a record of a female <num> cm <num> in across that had gorged herself on at least <num> small crabs
in the bahía magdalena lagoon complex baja california sur its most important source of food are pea crabs followed by the razor clam solyema valvulus and then polychaete worms
the typical hunting strategy of the diamond stingray is to cruise just above the sea floor landing atop any prey encountered
it then quickly levers its body up @-@ and @-@ down with its disc producing negative pressure to extract the prey from its burrow
this ray has also been known to excavate large pits by undulating its disc and spitting jets of water so as to uncover buried prey
diamond stingrays are frequently trailed by smaller fishes including mexican hogfish bodianus diplotaenia galapagos porgies calamus taurinus greybar grunts haemulon sexfasciatum spinster wrasses halichoeres nichols and long @-@ spine porcupinefish diodon holocanthus which take advantage of the invertebrates stirred up by the ray 's activities
known parasites of this species include the tapeworms acanthobothrium bullardi a
dasi a
rajivi and a
soberoni anthocephalum currani parachristianella tiygonis and pseudochristianello elegantissima the flukes anaporrhutum euzeti and probolitrema mexicana and the monogenean listrocephalos kearni
like other stingrays the diamond stingray is aplacental viviparous the embryos are initially nourished by yolk and later by histotroph uterine milk rich in proteins and lipids produced by the mother
only the left ovary and uterus are functional in adult females
several bays along the pacific coast of baja california are known to serve as nurseries
most of the life history information available on this species has come from bahía magdalena where females bear one litter of <num> – <num> pups per year
courtship and mating occurs in late summer from july to august but due to a ten @-@ month period of either sperm storage or diapause wherein the embryo becomes dormant embryonic development does not begin until the following year and is completed within <num> – <num> months
birthing takes place in summer from july to september in shallow estuaries the newborns measure <num> – <num> cm <num>
<num> – <num>
<num> in across
during el niño years the higher temperatures appear to shift the timing of birth forward
the diamond stingray has the lowest growth rate of any stingray species yet studied
males reach sexual maturity at around <num> – <num> cm <num> – <num> in across and <num> years of age while females grow slower still reaching maturity at around <num> – <num> cm <num> – <num> in across and <num> years of age
the maximum lifespan has been estimated at least <num> years for males and <num> years for females
however it is not aggressive and will usually flee given the opportunity
this ray is not found off the united states in sufficient numbers to be economically important
elsewhere in its range it is caught in substantial numbers for human consumption both intentionally and as bycatch the pectoral fins or wings are sold fresh or filleted and salted
the international union for conservation of nature iucn notes that the diamond stingray 's low reproductive productivity renders it susceptible to population depletion but currently lacks enough biological and fishery data to assess it beyond data deficient overall or in the u
s
central and south american parts of its range
in mexico the diamond stingray is one of the most important components of pacific artisanal shark and ray fisheries comprising around a tenth of the total annual catch
its significance is likely underestimated as mexican fishery reports frequently suffer from misidentifications and a lack of species @-@ specific data
it is mainly caught during summer and fall being the most common ray landed in bahía magdalena and second most common ray landed off sonora state
demersal gillnets are the main fishing gear employed both adult and juvenile rays easily become entangled in the mesh by their tail spines with juveniles known to have comprised most of the bahía magdalena catch in <year> – <year>
this species is also often caught incidentally in bottom trawls on longlines and in fish traps
in the future habitat degradation from increasing numbers of shrimp farms may pose an additional threat to this species in the region
as a result of these pressures the iucn has assessed the diamond stingray as near threatened in mexican waters
no management schemes have yet been enacted for this species
he achieved domestic political success as a member of parliament and later secretary of state under king james i
he lost much of his political power after his support for a failed marriage alliance between prince charles and the spanish house of habsburg royal family
rather than continue in politics he resigned all of his political offices in <year> except for his position on the privy council and declared his catholicism publicly
he was created baron baltimore in the irish peerage upon his resignation
baltimore manor was located in county longford ireland
calvert took an interest in the british colonization of the americas at first for commercial reasons and later to create a refuge for english catholics
he became the proprietor of avalon the first sustained english settlement on the southeastern peninsula on the island of newfoundland off the eastern coast of modern canada
discouraged by its cold and sometimes inhospitable climate and the sufferings of the settlers sir george looked for a more suitable spot further south and sought a new royal charter to settle the region which would become the state of maryland
calvert died five weeks before the new charter was sealed leaving the settlement of the maryland colony to his son cecil <year> @-@ <year>
his second son leonard calvert <year> @-@ <year> was the first colonial governor of the province of maryland
historians have long recognized george calvert as the founder of maryland in spirit if not in fact
at george calvert 's knighting it was claimed that his family originally came from flanders a dutch @-@ speaking area today across the english channel in modern @-@ day kingdom of belgium
calvert 's father an earlier leonard was a country gentleman who had achieved some prominence as a tenant of lord wharton and was wealthy enough to marry a gentlewoman of a noble line alicia or alice crossland or sometimes spelled crosland
he established his family on the estate of the later @-@ built kiplin hall near catterick in richmondshire of yorkshire
george calvert was born at kiplin in late <year> birth month and day yet to be researched
his mother alicia alice died on <num> november <year> when he was fifteen years old
his father then married grace crossland or sometimes spelled crosland alicia 's first cousin
in <year> sir thomas gargrave had described richmondshire as a territory where all gentlemen were evil in religion by which he meant predominately roman catholic it appears leonard calvert was no exception
during the reign of queen elizabeth i continuing the changes wrought in the previous century by her father king henry viii making the monarch the supreme authority of the christian church in england continuing the pace protestant reformation from the continent of europe with the political spiritual and temporal separation from the roman catholic church and the pope papacy in rome therefore the royal government exerted authority over the matters of religious faith practices and the church
acts mandating compulsory religious uniformity were enacted by parliament and enforced through penal laws
the acts of supremacy and the uniformity act of <year> also included an oath of allegiance to the queen henrietta maria wife of charles i and an implicit denial of the pope 's then pope paul iv authority over the english church
this oath was required of any common subject synamous for citizen who wished to hold high office attend university or take advantage of opportunities controlled by the state king kingdom
the calvert household suffered the intrusion of the elizabethan @-@ era religious laws
from the year of george 's birth onwards his father leonard calvert was subjected to repeated harassment by the yorkshire authorities who in <year> extracted a promise of conformity from him compelling his attendance at the church of england services
in <year> when george was twelve the authorities denounced one of his tutors for teaching from a popish primer and instructed leonard and grace to send george and his brother christopher to a protestant tutor and if necessary to present the children before the commission once a month to see how they perfect in learning
as a result the boys were sent to a protestant tutor called mr
fowberry at bilton
the senior calvert had to give a bond of conformity he was banned from employing any catholic servants and forced to purchase an english bible which was to ly open in his house for everyone to read
in <year> records show that grace calvert was committed to the custody of a pursuivant an official responsible for identifying and persecuting catholics and in <year> she was described as the wife of leonard calvert of kipling non @-@ communicant at easter last
george calvert went up to trinity college at oxford university matriculating in <year> <num> where he studied foreign languages and received a bachelor 's degree in <year>
as the oath of allegiance was compulsory after the age of sixteen he would almost certainly have pledged conformity while at oxford
the same pattern of conformity whether pretended or sincere continued through calvert 's early life
after oxford he moved to london in <year> where he studied municipal law at lincoln 's inn for three years
his children including his eldest son and heir cecil who was born in the winter of <year> – <num> were all baptized as christian protestants
when anne died on <num> august <year> she was buried at calvert 's local protestant parish church st martin in the fields
calvert had a total of thirteen children cecil who succeeded his father as the <num> baron baltimore leonard anne mary dorothy elizabeth grace francis george helen henry john and philip
spymaster to queen elizabeth whom calvert had met during an extended trip to europe between <year> and <year> after which he became known as a specialist in foreign affairs
calvert carried a packet for cecilius from paris and so entered the service of the principal engineer on behalf of king james vi of scotland 's succession to the english throne in <year> who then also assumed the title of king james i of england
king james rewarded robert cecil whom he made a privy councillor and secretary of state with the granting of the title of earl of salisbury in <year> and lord high treasurer in <year> making him the most powerful man at the royal court
as cecil rose calvert rose with him
calvert 's foreign languages legal training and discretion made him an invaluable aide to robert cecil who no lover of catholics seems to have accepted calvert 's conformity as beyond question
working at the center of court politics calvert exploited his influence by selling favors an accepted practice for the times
calvert accumulated a number of small offices honors and sinecures
in august <year> he attended the king at oxford and received an honorary master @-@ of @-@ arts degree in an elaborate ceremony at which the duke of lennox ludovic stewart the earls of oxford and northumberland and cecilius received degrees
given the prestige of the other graduates calvert 's was the last awarded but his presence in such company signaled his growing stature
in <year> the king made calvert clerk of the crown and assizes in connaught county clare ireland his first royal appointment
in <year> james appointed him a clerk of the signet office a post which required the preparation of documents for the royal signature and brought calvert into close contact with the king
calvert also served in james 's first parliament as a member for the borough of bossiney in the county of cornwall installed there by cecil to support his policies
in <year> calvert was appointed a clerk of the privy council
each of these positions would have required an oath of allegiance
with robert cecil 's support george calvert came into his own as an advisor and supporter of king james
in <year> and <year> calvert undertook missions to the continent on behalf of the king visiting a number of embassies in paris holland and the duchy of cleves and acting as an ambassador to the french royal court during the coronation of king louis xiii <year> @-@ <year> in <year>
a correspondent from france reported that calvert gave everyone great contentment with his discreet conversation
in <year> james sent him to the continental electorate of the palatinate german in the holy roman empire whose impoverished elector frederick v elector palatine <year> @-@ <year> had married james 's daughter elizabeth of bohemia <year> @-@ <year> in <year>
calvert had to convey the king 's disapproval that elizabeth for lack of money had given away expensive jewels to a gentlewoman leaving her employ
elector frederick 's decision in <year> to accept the throne of bohemia triggered a war with the powerful neighboring habsburgs dynasty of austria to the southwest in vienna which james attempted to end through a proposed alliance with the kingdom of spain
in <year> james employed calvert to research and transcribe his tract against the dutch protestant theologian conrad vorstius <year> @-@ <year>
the following year cecil died and calvert acted as one of the four executors of his will
the king 's favourite sir robert carr first earl of somerset <year> @-@ <year> viscount rochester assumed the duties of secretary of state and recruited calvert to assist with foreign policy in particular the latin and spanish correspondence
carr soon raised to the earldom of somerset was not a success in the job and fell from favour partly as a result of the murder of thomas overbury <year> @-@ <year> to which carr 's wife frances the former countess of essex and later somerset <year> @-@ <year> pleaded guilty in <year>
carr 's place as james 's principal favorite was now taken by the handsome george villiers 1st duke of buckingham <year> @-@ <year> with whom james was said to have been infatuated
in <year> the king commissioned calvert to investigate roman catholic grievances in ireland along with sir humphrey wynch <year> @-@ <year> sir charles cornwallis xxx <num> and sir roger wilbraham <year> @-@ <year>
the commission spent almost four months in ireland and its final report partly drafted by calvert concluded that religious conformity should be enforced more strictly in ireland catholic schools be suppressed and bad priests removed and punished
the king resolved not to reconvene the parliament of ireland until the catholics shall be better disciplined
in <year> james endowed calvert with the manor of danby wiske in yorkshire which brought him into contact with sir thomas wentworth 1st earl of strafford <year> @-@ <year> who became his closest friend and political ally
calvert was now wealthy enough to buy the kiplin hall estate in his home parish
today the university of maryland operates a research centre there while the main building is a house museum owned by the kiplin hall trust
in his home parish and in <year> his social status received a further boost when he was knighted then becoming sir george calvert
in <year> calvert completed his rise to power when james appointed him as one of the two principal secretaries of state
this followed the dismissal of sir thomas lake <year> @-@ <year> due to scandals including his wife 's indiscretions with state secrets
not emerging as a candidate until the end of the selection process calvert 's appointment surprised him and most observers
assuming he owed his promotion to the king 's increasingly powerful favourite george villiers <year> @-@ <year> later first duke of buckingham he sent him a great jewel as a token of thanks
villiers returned the jewel however saying he had had nothing to do with the matter
calvert 's personal fortune was secured when he was additionally appointed a commissioner of the treasury with a pension of £ <num> @,@ <num> pounds sterling and a subsidy on imported raw silk which would later be converted to another £ <num> @,@ <num> pension
in the parliament of <year> it fell to calvert to advocate the spanish match as it came to be called against the majority of parliament who feared an increase in catholic influence on the state
as a result of his pro @-@ spanish stance and defence of relaxations in the penal laws against catholics calvert became estranged from many in the commons who were suspicious of his close familiarity with the spanish ambassador 's court
calvert also faced difficulties in his private life his wife 's death on <num> august <year> left him the single father of ten children the oldest of whom cecil was sixteen years old
although king james rewarded calvert in <year> for his loyalty by granting him a <num> @,@ <num> @-@ acre <num>
<num> km2 estate in county longford in the central ireland region of leinster where his seat was known as the manor of baltimore calvert was increasingly isolated from court circles as the prince of wales heir to the throne and the first duke of buckingham george villiers wrested control of policy from the ageing james
without consulting the diplomatically astute calvert the prince and the duke travelled to spain to negotiate the spanish marriage for themselves with disastrous results
instead of securing an alliance the visit provoked a hostility between the two courts which quickly led to war
in a reversal of policy buckingham dismissed the treaties with spain summoned a war council and sought a french marriage for the welsh prince
the degree of his disfavour was shown when he was reprimanded for supposedly delaying diplomatic letters
calvert bowed to the inevitable
on the pretext of ill health he began negotiations for the sale of his position finally resigning the secretariat in february <year>
no disgrace was attached to calvert 's departure from office the king to whom he had always remained personally loyal confirmed his place on the privy council and appointed him baron baltimore in county longford in leinster of central ireland
immediately after calvert resigned he converted to roman catholicism
the connection between calvert 's resignation and his conversion to roman catholicism was a complex one
george cottington a former employee of calvert suggested in <year> that calvert 's conversion had been in progress a long time before it was made public
george abbot <year> @-@ <year> the reigning archbishop of canterbury and ecclesiastical head of the independent church of england reported that political opposition to calvert combined with his loss of office had made him discontented and as the saying is desperatio facit monachum so hee apparently did turne papist which hee now professeth this being the third time that he hath bene to blame that way sic
godfrey goodman the bishop of gloucester later claimed calvert had been a secret catholic all along infinitely addicted to the catholic faith which explained his support for lenient policies towards catholics and for the spanish match
however no one had questioned calvert 's conformity at the time and if he had indeed been secretly catholic he had hidden it well
it seems more likely calvert converted in late <year>
at the time simon stock a discalced carmelite priest reported to the congregation propaganda fide in rome on november <num> that he had converted two privy councillors to catholicism one of whom historians are certain was calvert
calvert who had probably met stock at the spanish embassy in london later worked with the priest on a plan for a catholic mission in his new first newfoundland colony off modern canada
when king james i and vi of scotland died in march <year> his successor king charles i maintained calvert 's barony but not his previous place on the privy council
calvert then turned his attention to his irish estates and his overseas investments
he was not entirely forgotten at court
after buckingham 's dabblings in wars against spain and france had ended in failure he recalled baltimore to court and for a while may have considered employing him in the peace negotiations with spain
though nothing came of baltimore 's recall he renewed his rights over the silk @-@ import duties which had lapsed with the death of james i and secured charles blessing for his venture in the new found land
in <year> calvert purchased a tract of land in newfoundland from sir william vaughan <year> @-@ <year> a welsh writer and colonial investor who had earlier failed to establish a colony on the large sub @-@ arctic island off the eastern coast of north america
he named the area of the peninsula as avalon after the legendary spot where christianity was supposedly introduced to roman britain in ancient times
the plantation lay on what is now called the avalon peninsula and included the fishing station at ferryland
calvert almost certainly had a fishery project in mind at this stage
calvert dispatched captain edward wynne and a group of welsh colonists to ferryland where they landed in august <year> and set about constructing a settlement
wynne sent positive reports concerning the potential for local fisheries and for the production of salt hemp flax tar iron timber and hops
wynne also praised the climate declaring it is better and not so cold as england and predicted that the colony would become self @-@ sufficient after one year
others corroborated wynne 's reports for example captain daniel powell who delivered a further party of settlers to ferryland wrote the land on which our governor calvert and or wynne planted is so good and commodious that for the quantity i think there is no better in many parts of england but he added ominously that ferryland was the coldest harbour in the land
wynne and his men began work on various building projects including a substantial house and the shoring up of the harbour
to protect them against marauding french warships a recent hazard in the area since the recent founding of new france in the interior modern lower canada of the <num> and <num> centuries province of quebec and dominion of canada along the st
lawrence river calvert employed the pirate john nutt
the settlement appeared to be progressing so well that in january <year> calvert obtained a concession from king james for the whole of newfoundland though the grant was soon reduced to cover only the southeastern avalon peninsula owing to competing claims from other english colonists
the final charter constituted the province as a county palatinate officially titled the province of avalon under calvert 's personal rule
after resigning the royal secretariat of state in <year> the new baron baltimore made clear his intention to visit the colony i intend shortly he wrote in march god willing a journey for newfoundland to visit a plantation which i began there some few years since
his plans were disrupted by the death of king james i and by the crackdown on catholics with which king charles i began his reign in order to appease his opponents
the new king required all privy councillors to take the oaths of supremacy and allegiance and since baltimore as a catholic had to refuse he was obliged to step down from that cherished office
given the new religious and political climate and perhaps also to escape a serious outbreak of plague in england baltimore moved to his estates in ireland
his expedition to newfoundland had set sail without him in late may <year> under sir arthur aston who became the new provincial governor of avalon
a reference by david rothe bishop of ossary in ireland to a joane also recorded as jane baltimore now wife of calvert reveals that baltimore had recently remarried
from the time of his conversion in <year> onwards baltimore took care to cater for the religious needs of his colonists both catholic and protestant
he had asked simon stock to provide priests for the <year> expedition but stock 's recruits arrived in england after aston had sailed
stock 's own ambitions for the colony appear to have exceeded baltimore 's in letters to de propaganda fide in rome stock claimed the newfoundland settlement could act as a springboard for the conversion of natives not only in the new world but also in china the latter via a passage he believed existed from the east coast to the pacific ocean
in may <year> he wrote to wentworth aston 's return to england in late <year> along with all the catholic settlers failed to deter baltimore who finally sailed for newfoundland in <year> arriving on july <num> and staying only two months before returning to england
he had taken both protestant and catholic settlers with him as well as two secular priests thomas longville and anthony pole also known as smith the latter remaining behind in the colony when baltimore departed for england
the land baltimore had seen was by no means the paradise described by some early settlers being only marginally productive as the summer climate was deceptively mild his brief visit gave baltimore no reason to alter his plans for the colony
in <year> he sailed again for newfoundland this time with his second wife jane most of his children and <num> more settlers to officially take over as proprietary governor of avalon
he and his family moved into the house at ferryland built by wynne a sizeable structure for the time by colonial standards and the only one in the settlement large enough to accommodate religious services for the community
matters connected to religion were to bedevil baltimore 's stay in this remote part of the worlde where i have planted my selfe sic
he sailed at a time when english military preparations were underway to relieve the huguenots at la rochelle
he was dismayed to find that the war with france had spread to newfoundland and that he had to spend most of his time fighting off french attacks on english fishing fleets with his own ships the dove and the ark
as he wrote to buckingham i came to builde and sett and sowe but i am falne to fighting with frenchmen sic
his settlers were so successful against the french that they captured several ships which they escorted back to england to help with the war effort
baltimore was granted the loan of one of the ships to aid in his defence of the colony as well as a share of the prize money
adopting a policy of free religious worship in the colony baltimore allowed the catholics to worship in one part of his house and the protestants in another
this novel arrangement proved too much for the resident anglican priest erasmus stourton — that knave stourton as baltimore referred to him — who after altercations with baltimore was placed on a ship for england where he lost no time in reporting baltimore 's practices to the authorities complaining that the catholic priests smith and hackett said mass every sunday and doe use all other ceremonies of the church of rome in as ample a manner as tis used in spayne sic
and that baltimore had the son of a protestant forcibly baptised as a catholic
although stourton 's complaints were investigated by the privy council due to baltimore 's support in high places the case was dismissed
baltimore had become disenchanted with conditions in this wofull country and he wrote to his old acquaintances in england lamenting his troubles
the final blow to his hopes was dealt by the newfoundland winter of <year> – <num> which did not release its grip until may
like others before them the residents of avalon suffered terribly from the cold and from malnutrition
nine or ten of baltimore 's company died that winter and with half the settlers ill at one time his house had to be turned into a hospital
the sea froze over and nothing would grow before may
tis not terra christianorum baltimore wrote to wentworth
he confessed to the king i have found
by too deare bought experience that which other men always concealed from me
that there is a sad face of wynter upon all this land
baltimore solicited a new charter from the king
in order to found an alternative colony in a less hostile climate further south he requested a precinct in virginia where he could grow tobacco
he wrote to his friends francis cottington and thomas wentworth enlisting their support for this new proposal admitting the impression his abandonment of avalon might make in england i shall rayse a great deal of talke and discourse and be censured by most men of giddiness and levity sic
the king perhaps guided by baltimore 's friends at court replied expressing concern for baltimore 's health and gently advising him to forget colonial schemes and return to england where he would be treated with every respect men of your condition and breeding are fitter for other imployments than the framing of new plantations which commonly have rugged laborious beginnings and require much greater meanes in managing them than usually the power of one private subject can reach unto
baltimore sent his children home to england in august
by the time the king 's letter reached avalon he had departed with his wife and servants for virginia
they gave him the oaths of supremacy and allegiance which he refused to take so they ordered him to leave
after no more than a few weeks in the colony baltimore left for england to pursue the new charter leaving his wife and servants behind
in early <year> he procured a ship to fetch them but it foundered off the irish coast and his wife was drowned
baltimore described himself the following year as a long time myself a man of sorrows
baltimore spent the last two years of his life constantly lobbying for his new charter though the obstacles proved difficult
the virginians led by william claiborne who sailed to england to make the case campaigned aggressively against separate colonising of the chesapeake claiming they possessed the rights to that area
baltimore was short of capital having exhausted his fortune and was sometimes forced to depend on the assistance of his friends
to make matters worse in the summer of <year> his household was infected by the plague which he survived
he wrote to wentworth blessed be god for it who hath preserved me now from shipwreck hunger scurvy and pestilence
his health declining baltimore 's persistence over the charter finally paid off in <year>
the king first granted him a location south of jamestown but baltimore asked the king to reconsider in response to opposition from other investors interested in settling the new land of carolina into a sugar plantation
baltimore eventually compromised by accepting redrawn boundaries to the north of the potomac river on either side of the chesapeake bay
the charter was about to pass when the fifty @-@ two @-@ year @-@ old baltimore died in his lodgings at lincoln 's inn fields on <num> april <year>
five weeks later on <num> june <year> the charter for maryland passed the seals
baltimore 's two colonies in the new world continued under the proprietorship of his family
avalon which remained a prime spot for the salting and export of fish was expropriated by sir david kirke with a new royal charter which cecil calvert vigorously challenged and it was finally absorbed into newfoundland in <year>
although baltimore 's failed avalon venture marked the end of an early era of attempts at proprietary colonisation it laid the foundation upon which permanent settlements developed in that region of newfoundland
maryland became a prime tobacco exporting colony in the mid @-@ atlantic and for a time a refuge for catholic settlers as george calvert had hoped
under the rule of the lords baltimore thousands of british catholics emigrated to maryland establishing some of the oldest catholic communities in what later became the united states
however catholic rule in maryland was eventually nullified by the re @-@ assertion of royal control over the colony
<num> years after its first settlement maryland joined twelve other british colonies along the atlantic coast in declaring their independence from british rule and the right to freedom of religion for all citizens in the new united states
during the second seminole war beginning in <year> the united states military 's mission was to seek out seminole people in the everglades and capture or kill them
those missions gave the military the opportunity to map land that seemed to frustrate and confound them at every turn
a national push for expansion and progress toward the latter part of the <num> century stimulated interest in draining the everglades for agricultural use
according to historians from the middle of the nineteenth century to the middle of the twentieth century the united states went through a period in which wetland removal was not questioned
indeed it was considered the proper thing to do
a pattern of political and financial motivation and a lack of understanding of the geography and ecology of the everglades have plagued the history of drainage projects
the everglades are a part of a massive watershed that originates near orlando and drains into lake okeechobee a vast and shallow lake
as the lake exceeds its capacity in the wet season the water forms a flat and very wide river about <num> miles <num> km long and <num> miles <num> km wide
as the land from lake okeechobee slopes gradually to florida bay water flows at a rate of half a mile <num>
<num> km a day
before human activity in the everglades the system comprised the lower third of the florida peninsula
the first attempt to drain the region was made by real estate developer hamilton disston in <year>
disston 's sponsored canals were unsuccessful but the land he purchased for them stimulated economic and population growth that attracted railway developer henry flagler
flagler built a railroad along the east coast of florida and eventually to key west towns grew and farmland was cultivated along the rail line
during his <year> campaign to be elected governor napoleon bonaparte broward promised to drain the everglades and his later projects were more effective than disston 's
broward 's promises sparked a land boom facilitated by blatant errors in an engineer 's report pressure from real estate developers and the burgeoning tourist industry throughout south florida
the increased population brought hunters who went unchecked and had a devastating impact on the numbers of wading birds hunted for their plumes alligators and other everglades animals
severe hurricanes in <year> and <year> caused catastrophic damage and flooding from lake okeechobee that prompted the army corps of engineers to build a dike around the lake
further floods in <year> prompted an unprecedented construction of canals throughout southern florida
following another population boom after world war ii and the creation of the central and southern florida flood control project the everglades was divided into sections separated by canals and water control devices that delivered water to agricultural and newly developed urban areas
however in the late <num> following a proposal to construct a massive airport next to everglades national park national attention turned from developing the land to restoring the everglades
the united states spent between <num> million and <num> million and lost between <num> @,@ <num> and <num> @,@ <num> lives
the u
s
military drove the seminoles into the everglades and were charged with the task of finding them defeating them and moving them to oklahoma indian territory
almost <num> @,@ <num> seminoles were killed in the war or were removed
the u
s
military was completely unprepared for the conditions they found in the everglades
they tore their clothes on sawgrass ruined their boots on the uneven limestone floor and were plagued by mosquitoes
soldiers legs feet and arms were cut open on the sawgrass and gangrene infection set in taking many lives and limbs
many died of mosquito @-@ borne illness
after slogging through mud one private died in his tracks of exhaustion in <year>
general thomas jesup admitted the military was overwhelmed by the terrain when he wrote to the secretary of war in <year> trying to dissuade him from prolonging the war
opinion about the value of florida to the union was mixed some thought it a useless land of swamps and horrible animals while others thought it a gift from god for national prosperity
in <year> comments in the army and navy chronicle supported future development of southern florida the climate is most delightful but from want of actual observation it could not speak so confidently of the soil although from the appearance of the surrounding vegetation a portion of it at least must be rich
whenever the aborigines shall be forced from their fastnesses as eventually they must be the enterprising spirit of our countrymen will very soon discover the sections best adapted to cultivation and the now barren or unproductive everglades will be made to blossom like a garden
it is the general impression that these everglades are uninhabitable during the summer months by reason of their being overflowed by the abundant rains of the season but if it should prove that these inundations are caused or increased by obstructions to the natural courses of the rivers as outlets to the numerous lakes american industry will remove these obstructions
the military penetration of southern florida offered the opportunity to map a poorly understood part of the country
as late as <year> official reports doubted the existence of a large inland lake until the military met the seminoles at the battle of lake okeechobee in <year>
to avenge repeated surprise attacks on himself and ammunition stores colonel william harney led an expedition into the everglades in <year> to hunt for a chief named chekika
with harney were <num> soldiers in <num> canoes
one soldier 's account of the trip in the st
augustine news was the first printed description of the everglades available to the general public
the anonymous writer described the hunt for chekika and the terrain they were crossing no country that i have ever heard of bears any resemblance to it it seems like a vast sea filled with grass and green trees and expressly intended as a retreat for the rascally indian from which the white man would never seek to drive them
the final blame for the military stalemate was determined to lie not in military preparation supplies leadership or superior tactics by the seminoles but in florida 's impenetrable terrain
an army surgeon wrote it is in fact a most hideous region to live in a perfect paradise for indians alligators serpents frogs and every other kind of loathsome reptile
the land seemed to inspire extreme reactions of wonder or hatred
in <year> an author described the mangrove forests as a waste of nature 's grandest exhibition to have these carnivals of splendid vegetation occurring in isolated places where it is but seldom they are seen
a band of hunters naturalists and collectors ventured through in <year> taking along with them the <num> @-@ year @-@ old grandson of an early resident of miami
the landscape unnerved the young man shortly after he entered the shark river the place looked wild and lonely
about three o 'clock it seemed to get on henry 's nerves and we saw him crying he would not tell us why he was just plain scared
in <year> an explorer named hugh willoughby spent eight days canoeing with a party from the mouth of the harney river to the miami river
he wrote about his observations and sent them back to the new orleans times @-@ democrat
willoughby described the water as healthy and wholesome with numerous springs and <num> @,@ <num> alligators more or less in lake okeechobee
the party encountered thousands of birds near the shark river killing hundreds but they continued to return
willoughby pointed out that much of the rest of the country had been mapped and explored except for this part of florida writing w e have a tract of land one hundred and thirty miles long and seventy miles wide that is as much unknown to the white man as the heart of africa
many queries like these passed through our minds
they can only be solved by a thorough examination of the whole country
could the waters be lowered ten feet it would probably drain six hundred thousand acres should this prove to be a rich soil as would seem probable what a field it would open for tropical productions what facilities for commerce territorial representative david levy proposed a resolution that was passed in congress in <year> that the secretary of war be directed to place before this house such information as can be obtained in relation to the practicability and probable expense of draining the everglades of florida
from this directive secretary of the treasury robert j
walker requested thomas buckingham smith from st
augustine to consult those with experience in the everglades on the feasibility of draining them saying that he had been told two or three canals to the gulf of mexico would be sufficient
smith asked officers who had served in the seminole wars to respond and many favored the idea promoting the land as a future agricultural asset to the south
a few disagreed such as captain john sprague who wrote he never supposed the country would excite an inquiry other than as a hiding place for indians and had it occurred to me that so great an undertaking one so utterly impracticable as draining the ever glades was to be discussed i should not have destroyed the scratch of pen upon a subject so fruitful and which cannot be understood but by those who have waded the water belly deep and examined carefully the western coast by land and by water
nevertheless smith returned a report to the secretary of the treasury asking for <num> @,@ <num> to do the job
the report is the first published study on the topic of the everglades and concluded with the statement the ever glades are now suitable only for the haunt of noxious vermin or the resort of pestilent reptiles
the statesman whose exertions shall cause the millions of acres they contain now worse than worthless to teem with the products of agricultural industry that man who thus adds to the resources of his country
will merit a high place in public favor not only with his own generation but with posterity
he will have created a state smith suggested cutting through the rim of the everglades known today as the atlantic coastal ridge connecting the heads of rivers to the coastline so that <num> feet <num>
<num> m of water would be drained from the area
the result smith hoped would yield farmland suitable for corn sugar rice cotton and tobacco
in <year> congress passed a law that gave several states wetlands within their state boundaries
the swamp and overflowed lands act ensured that the state would be responsible for funding the attempts at developing wetlands into farmlands
florida quickly formed a committee to consolidate grants to pay for such attempts though attention and funds were diverted owing to the civil war and reconstruction
not until after <year> did attention return to the everglades
iif trustees found a pennsylvania real estate developer named hamilton disston who was interested in implementing plans to drain the land for agriculture
disston was persuaded to buy <num> @,@ <num> @,@ <num> acres <num> @,@ <num> km2 of land for <num> million in <year>
the new york times declared it the largest purchase of land ever by any individual
disston began building canals near st
cloud to lower the basin of the caloosahatchee and kissimmee rivers
his workers and engineers faced conditions similar to those of the soldiers during the seminole wars it was harrowing backbreaking labor in dangerous conditions
the canals seemed at first to work in lowering the water levels in the wetlands surrounding the rivers
another dredged waterway between the gulf of mexico and lake okeechobee was built opening the region to steamboat traffic
disston 's engineers focused on lake okeechobee as well
as one colleague put it okeechobee is the point to attack the canals were to be equal or greater than the inflow from the kissimmee valley which is the source of all the evil
disston sponsored the digging of a canal <num> miles <num> km long from lake okeechobee towards miami but it was abandoned when the rock proved denser than the engineers had expected
though the canals lowered the groundwater their capacity was inadequate for the wet season
a report that evaluated the failure of the project concluded the reduction of the waters is simply a question of sufficient capacity in the canals which may be dug for their relief
though disston 's canals did not drain his purchase primed the economy of florida
it made news and attracted tourists and land buyers alike
within four years property values doubled and the population increased significantly
one newcomer was the inventor thomas edison who bought a home in fort myers
disston opened real estate offices throughout the united states and europe and sold tracts of land for <num> an acre establishing towns on the west coast and in central florida
english tourists in particular were targeted and responded in large numbers
florida passed its first water laws to build drains ditches or water courses upon petition of two or more landowners in <year>
augustine during a vacation
he built the opulent ponce de león hotel in st
augustine in <year> and began buying land and building rail lines along the east coast of florida first from jacksonville to daytona then as far south as palm beach in <year>
flagler 's establishment of the styx a settlement for hotel and rail line workers across the river from the barrier island containing palm beach became west palm beach
along the way he built resort hotels transforming territorial outposts into tourist destinations and the land bordering the rail lines into citrus farms
the winter of <year> – <year> produced a bitter frost that killed citrus trees as far south as palm beach
miami resident julia tuttle sent flagler a pristine orange blossom and an invitation to visit miami to persuade him to build the railroad farther south
although he had earlier turned her down several times flagler finally agreed and by <year> the rail line had been extended to biscayne bay
three months after the first train arrived the residents of miami <num> in all voted to incorporate the town
flagler publicized miami as a magic city throughout the united states and it became a prime destination for the extremely wealthy after the royal palm hotel was opened
legal battles ensued between the state of florida and the railroad owners about who owned the rights to sell reclaimed land in the everglades
in <year> gubernatorial campaigning the strongest candidate napoleon bonaparte broward made draining the everglades a major plank
he called the future of south florida the empire of the everglades and compared its potential to that of holland and egypt it would indeed be a commentary on the intelligence and energy of the state of florida to confess that so simple an engineering feat as the drainage of a body of land above the sea was above their power he wrote to voters
soon after his election he fulfilled his promise to drain that abominable pestilence @-@ ridden swamp and pushed the florida legislature to form a group of commissioners to oversee reclamation of flooded lands
they began by taxing counties that would be affected by the drainage attempts at <num> cents an acre and formed the everglades drainage district in <year>
broward asked james o
wright — an engineer on loan to the state of florida from the usda 's bureau of drainage investigations — to draw up plans for drainage in <year>
two dredges were built by <year> but had cut only <num> miles <num>
<num> km of canals
the project quickly ran out of money so broward sold real estate developer richard j
bolles a million dollars worth of land in the everglades <num> @,@ <num> acres <num> @,@ <num> km2 before the engineer 's report had been submitted
abstracts from wright 's report were given to the iif stating that eight canals would be enough to drain <num> @,@ <num> @,@ <num> acres <num> @,@ <num> km2 at a cost of a dollar an acre
the abstracts were released to real estate developers who used them in their advertisements and wright and the usda were pressed by the real estate industry to publicize the report as quickly as possible
wright 's supervisor noted errors in the report as well as undue enthusiasm for draining and delayed its release in <year>
different unofficial versions of the report circulated — some that had been altered by real estate interests — and a version hastily put together by senator duncan u
fletcher called u
s
senate document <num> included early unrevised statements causing a frenzy of speculation
wright 's initial report concluded that drainage would not be difficult
building canals would be more cost effective than constructing a dike around lake okeechobee
the soil would be fertile after drainage the climate would not be adversely affected and the enormous lake would be able to irrigate farmland in the dry season
wright based his conclusions on <num> years of weather data since the recording of precipitation began in the <num>
his calculations concentrated on the towns of jupiter and kissimmee
since weather data had not been recorded for any area within the everglades none was included in the report
furthermore the heaviest year of rain on record wright assumed was atypical and he urged that canals should not be constructed to bear that amount of water due to the expense
wright 's calculations for what canals should be able to hold were off by <num> percent
his most fundamental mistake however was designing the canals for a maximum rainfall of <num> inches <num> cm of water a day based on flawed data for july and august rainfall despite available data that indicated torrential downpours of <num> inches <num> cm and <num> inches <num> cm had occurred in <num> @-@ hour periods
though a few voices expressed skepticism of the report 's conclusions — notably frank stoneman the editor of the miami news @-@ record the forerunner of the miami herald — the report was hailed as impeccable coming from a branch of the u
s
government
in <year> florida appointed wright to oversee the drainage and the real estate industry energetically misrepresented this mid @-@ level engineer as the world 's foremost authority on wetlands drainage in charge of the u
s
bureau of reclamation
however the u
s
house of representatives investigated wright since no report had officially been published despite the money paid for it
wright eventually retired when it was discovered that his colleagues disagreed with his conclusions and refused to approve the report 's publication
one testified at the hearings i regard mr
wright as absolutely and completely incompetent for any engineering work
governor broward ran for the u
s
senate in <year> but lost
broward and his predecessor william jennings were paid by richard bolles to tour the state to promote drainage
broward was elected to the senate in <year> but died before he could take office
he was eulogized across florida for his leadership and progressive inspiration
rapidly growing fort lauderdale paid him tribute by naming broward county after him the town 's original plan had been to name it everglades county
land in the everglades was being sold for <num> an acre a month after broward died
meanwhile henry flagler continued to build railway stations at towns as soon as the populations warranted them
news of the panama canal inspired him to connect his rail line to the closest deep water port
biscayne bay was too shallow so flagler sent railway scouts to explore the possibility of building the line through to the tip of mainland florida
the scouts reported that not enough land was present to build through the everglades so flagler instead changed the plan to build to key west in <year>
in april <year> — the end of the dry season — reporters from all over the u
s
were given a tour of what had recently been drained and they returned to their papers and raved about the progress
land developers sold <num> @,@ <num> lots in a few months
but as news about the wright report continued to be negative land values plummeted and sales decreased
developers were sued and arrested for mail fraud when people who had spent their life savings to buy land arrived in south florida expecting to find a dry parcel of land to build upon and instead found it completely underwater
advertisements promised land that would yield crops in eight weeks but for many it took at least as long just to clear
some burned off the sawgrass or other vegetation only to discover that the underlying peat continued to burn
animals and tractors used for plowing got mired in the muck and were useless
when the muck dried it turned to a fine black powder and created dust storms
settlers encountered rodents skinks and biting insects and faced dangers from mosquitoes poisonous snakes and alligators
though at first crops sprouted quickly and lushly they just as quickly wilted and died seemingly without reason
it was discovered later that the peat and muck lacked copper and other trace elements
the usda released a pamphlet in <year> that declared land along the new river canal would be too costly to keep drained and fertilized people in ft
lauderdale responded by collecting all of the pamphlets and burning them
with the increasing population in towns near the everglades came hunting opportunities
even decades earlier harriet beecher stowe had been horrified at the hunting by visitors and she wrote the first conservation publication for florida in <year> t he decks of boats are crowded with men whose only feeling amid our magnificent forests seems to be a wild desire to shoot something and who fire at every living thing on shore
otters and raccoons were the most widely hunted for their skins
otter pelts could fetch between <num> and <num> each
raccoons more plentiful only warranted <num> cents each in <year>
hunting often went unchecked on one trip a lake okeechobee hunter killed <num> alligators and <num> otters
wading birds were a particular target
their feathers were used in women 's hats from the late <num> century until the <num>
in <year> five million birds were estimated to have been killed for their feathers
they were usually shot in the spring when their feathers were colored for mating and nesting
aigrettes as the plumes were called in the millinery business sold in <year> for <num> an ounce also the price of gold
millinery was a <num> @-@ million @-@ a @-@ year industry that motivated plume harvesters to lie in wait at the nests of egrets and other large birds during the nesting season shoot the parents with small @-@ bore rifles and leave the chicks to starve
many hunters refused to participate after watching the gruesome results of a plume hunt
still plumes from everglades wading birds could be found in havana new york city london and paris
a dealer in new york paid at least <num> hunters to provide him with almost anything that wore feathers but particularly the herons spoonbills and showy birds
hunters could collect plumes from a hundred birds on a good day
plume harvesting became a dangerous business
the audubon society became concerned with the amount of hunting being done in rookeries in the mangrove forests
in <year> they hired a warden guy bradley to watch the rookeries around cuthbert lake
bradley had lived in flamingo within the everglades and was murdered in <year> by one of his neighbors after he tried to prevent him from hunting
protection of birds was the reason for establishing the first wildlife refuge when president theodore roosevelt set pelican island as a sanctuary in <year>
in the <num> after birds were protected and alligators hunted nearly to extinction prohibition created a living for those willing to smuggle alcohol into the u
s
from cuba
rum @-@ runners used the vast everglades as a hiding spot there were never enough law enforcement officers to patrol it
the advent of the fishing industry the arrival of the railroad and the discovery of the benefits of adding copper to okeechobee muck soon created unprecedented numbers of residents in new towns like moore haven clewiston and belle glade
by <year> <num> @,@ <num> people lived in <num> new towns around lake okeechobee
sugarcane became the primary crop grown in south florida and it began to be mass @-@ produced
miami experienced a second real estate boom that earned a developer in coral gables <num> million and saw undeveloped land north of miami sell for <num> @,@ <num> an acre
miami became cosmopolitan and experienced a renaissance of architecture and culture
hollywood movie stars vacationed in the area and industrialists built lavish homes
miami 's population multiplied fivefold and ft
lauderdale and palm beach grew many times over as well
in <year> miami newspapers published editions weighing over <num> pounds <num>
<num> kg most of it real estate advertising
waterfront property was the most highly valued
mangrove trees were cut down and replaced with palm trees to improve the view
acres of south florida slash pine were taken down some for lumber but the wood was found to be dense and it split apart when nails were driven into it
it was also termite @-@ resistant but homes were needed quickly
most of the pine forests in dade county were cleared for development
the winter of <year> was unseasonably wet and the region was underwater
the town of moore haven received <num> inches <num> @,@ <num> mm of rain in six weeks in <year>
engineers were pressured to regulate the water flow not only for farmers but also for commercial fishers who often requested conflicting water levels in the lake
fred elliot who was in charge of building the canals after james wright retired commented a man on one side of the canal wants it raised for his particular use and a man on the other side wants it lowered for his particular use
the last severe hurricane in <year> had struck the florida keys
many homes were constructed hastily and poorly as a result of this lull in storms
however on september <num> <year> a storm that became known as the <year> miami hurricane struck with winds over <num> miles per hour <num> km h and caused massive devastation
the storm surge was as high as <num> feet <num>
<num> m in some places
henry flagler 's opulent royal palm hotel was destroyed along with many other hotels and buildings
most people who died did so when they ran out into the street in disbelief while the eye of the hurricane passed over not knowing the wind was coming in from the other direction
the lull lasted <num> minutes and during that time the streets of the city became crowded with people wrote richard gray the local weather chief
as a result many lives were lost during the second phase of the storm
in miami alone <num> people were counted dead — although the true figure may have been as high as <num> because death totals were racially segregated
more than <num> @,@ <num> people were homeless in the city
the town of moore haven bordering lake okeechobee was hardest hit
a levee built of muck collapsed drowning almost <num> of the town 's entire <num> @,@ <num> residents
the tops of lake okeechobee levees were only <num> to <num> inches <num> to <num> cm above the lake itself and the engineers were aware of the danger
two days before the hurricane an engineer predicted i f we have a blow even a gale moore haven is going under water
the engineer lost his wife and daughter in the flood
the city of miami responded to the hurricane by downplaying its effects and turning down aid
the miami herald declared two weeks after the storm that almost everything in the city had returned to normal
the governor supported the efforts to minimize the appearance of the destruction by refusing to call a special legislative session to appropriate emergency funds for relief
as a result the american red cross was able to collect only <num> million of <num> million needed
the <year> hurricane effectively ended the land boom in miami despite the attempts at hiding the effects
it also forced drainage commissioners to re @-@ evaluate the effectiveness of the canals
a <num> million plan to build a dike around lake okeechobee to be paid by property taxes was turned down after a skeptical constituency sued to stop it more than <num> million had been spent on canals and they were ineffective in taking away excess water or delivering it when needed
in <year> construction was completed on the tamiami trail named because it was the only road spanning between tampa and miami
the builders attempted to construct the road several times before they blasted the muck down to the limestone filled it with rock and paved over it
hard rains in the summer caused lake okeechobee to rise several feet this was noticed by a local newspaper editor who demanded it be lowered
however on september <num> <year> came a massive storm now known as the <year> okeechobee hurricane
thousands drowned when lake okeechobee breached its levees the range of estimates of the dead spanned from <num> @,@ <num> according to the red cross to <num> @,@ <num> or more
many were swept away and never recovered
the majority of the dead were black migrant workers who had recently settled in or near belle glade
the catastrophe made national news and although the governor again refused aid after he toured the area and counted <num> bodies still unburied or uncollected a week after the storm he activated the national guard to assist in the cleanup and declared in a telegram without exaggeration the situation in the storm area beggars description
the okeechobee flood control district financed by both state and federal funds was created in <year>
president herbert hoover toured the towns affected by the <year> okeechobee hurricane and an engineer himself ordered the army corps of engineers to assist the communities surrounding the lake
between <year> and <year> a dike <num> miles <num> km long was built around the southern edge of the lake and a shorter one around the northern edge
it was <num> feet <num> m tall and <num>
<num> feet <num>
<num> m thick on the lake side <num> feet <num>
<num> m thick on the top and <num> feet <num>
<num> m thick toward land
control of the hoover dike and the waters of lake okeechobee were delegated to federal powers the united states declared legal limits of the lake to be <num> feet <num>
<num> m and <num> feet <num>
<num> m
a massive canal <num> feet <num> m wide and <num> feet <num>
<num> m deep was also dug through the caloosahatchee river when the lake rose too high the excess water left through the canal to the gulf of mexico
exotic trees were planted along the north shore levee australian pines australian oaks willows and bamboo
more than <num> million was spent on the entire project
sugarcane production soared after the dike and canal were built
the populations of the small towns surrounding the lake jumped from <num> @,@ <num> to <num> @,@ <num> after world war ii
an extended drought occurred in the <num> and with the wall preventing water leaving lake okeechobee and canals and ditches removing other water the everglades became parched
peat turned to dust and salty ocean water entered miami 's wells
when the city brought in an expert to investigate he discovered that the water in the everglades was the area 's groundwater — here it appeared on the surface
draining the everglades removed this groundwater which was replaced by ocean water seeping into the area 's wells
in <year> <num> million acres <num> @,@ <num> km2 of everglades burned and the black clouds of peat and sawgrass fires hung over miami
underground peat fires burned roots of trees and plants without burning the plants in some places
scientists who took soil samples before draining had not taken into account that the organic composition of peat and muck in the everglades was mixed with bacteria that added little to the process of decomposition underwater because they were not mixed with oxygen
as soon as the water was drained and oxygen mixed with the soil the bacteria began to break down the soil
in some places homes had to be moved on to stilts and <num> feet <num>
<num> m of topsoil was lost
south florida 's first and perhaps most enthusiastic naturalist was charles torrey simpson who retired from the smithsonian institution to miami in <year> when he was <num>
nicknamed the sage of biscayne bay simpson wrote several books about tropical plant life around miami
his backyard contained a tropical hardwood hammock which he estimated he showed to about <num> @,@ <num> people
though he tended to avoid controversy regarding development in ornamental gardening in florida he wrote mankind everywhere has an insane desire to waste and destroy the good and beautiful things this nature has lavished upon him
although the idea of protecting a portion of the everglades arose in <year> a crystallized effort was formed in <year> when miami landscape designer ernest f
coe established the everglades tropical national park association
it had enough support to be declared a national park by congress in <year> but there was not enough money during the great depression to buy the proposed <num> @,@ <num> @,@ <num> acres <num> @,@ <num> km2 for the park
it took another <num> years for it to be dedicated on december <num> <year>
one month before the dedication of the park the former editor of the miami herald and freelance writer marjory stoneman douglas published her first book the everglades river of grass
after researching the region for five years she described the history and ecology of the south of florida in great detail characterizing the everglades as a river instead of a stagnant swamp
douglas later wrote my colleague art marshall said that with the words river of grass i changed everybody 's knowledge and educated the world as to what the everglades meant
the last chapter was titled the eleventh hour and warned that the everglades were approaching death although the course could be reversed
its first printing sold out a month after its release
although there were no human casualties cattle and deer were drowned and standing water was left in suburban areas for months
agricultural interests lost about <num> million
the embattled head of the everglades drainage district carried a gun for protection after being threatened
the c sf used four methods in flood management levees water storage areas canal improvements and large pumps to assist gravity
between <year> and <year> in cooperation with the state of florida it built a levee <num> miles <num> km long between the eastern everglades and suburbs from palm beach to homestead and blocked the flow of water into populated areas
between <year> and <year> it divided the everglades into basins
in the northern everglades were water conservation areas wcas and the everglades agricultural area eaa bordering to the south of lake okeechobee
in the southern everglades was everglades national park
levees and pumping stations bordered each wca which released water in drier times and removed it and pumped it to the ocean or gulf of mexico in times of flood
the wcas took up about <num> percent of the original everglades
during the <num> and <num> the south florida metropolitan area grew four times as fast as the rest of the nation
between <year> and <year> <num> million people moved to south florida <num> @,@ <num> people moved to miami every week
urban development between the mid @-@ <num> and the late <num> quadrupled
much of the water reclaimed from the everglades was sent to newly developed areas
with metropolitan growth came urban problems associated with rapid expansion traffic jams school overcrowding crime overloaded sewage treatment plants and for the first time in south florida 's urban history water shortages in times of drought
the c sf constructed over <num> @,@ <num> miles <num> @,@ <num> km of canals and hundreds of pumping stations and levees within three decades
it produced a film waters of destiny characterized by author michael grunwald as propaganda that likened nature to a villainous shrieking force of rage and declared the c sf 's mission was to tame nature and make the everglades useful
everglades national park management and marjory stoneman douglas initially supported the c sf as it promised to maintain the everglades and manage the water responsibly
however an early report by the project reflected local attitudes about the everglades as a priority to people in nearby developed areas the aesthetic appeal of the park can never be as strong as the demands of home and livelihood
the manatee and the orchid mean something to people in an abstract way but the former cannot line their purse nor the latter fill their empty bellies
establishment of the c sf made everglades national park completely dependent upon another political entity for its survival
one of the c sf 's projects was levee <num> laid along the tamiami trail on the northern border of the park
levee <num> featured four flood control gates that controlled all the water entering everglades national park before construction water flowed in through open drain pipes
the period from <year> to <year> was one of drought for the everglades and levee <num> remained closed to allow the biscayne aquifer — the fresh water source for south florida — to stay filled
animals began to cross tamiami trail for the water held in wca <num> and many were killed by cars
biologists estimate the population of alligators in everglades national park was halved otters nearly became extinct
the populations of wading birds had been reduced by <num> percent from the <num>
when park management and the u
s
department of the interior asked the c sf for assistance the c sf offered to build a levee along the southern border of everglades national park to retain waters that historically flowed through the mangroves and into florida bay
though the c sf refused to send the park more water they constructed canal <num> bordering the east side of the park and carrying excess water from lake okeechobee to the atlantic
in the late <num> agricultural experiments indicated that adding large amounts of manganese sulfate to everglades muck produced profitable vegetable harvests
adding <num> pounds <num> kg of the compound was more cost effective than adding <num> short ton <num>
<num> t of manure
the primary cash crop in the eaa is sugarcane though sod beans lettuce celery and rice are also grown
sugarcane became more consolidated an industry than did any other crop in <year> the coalition of farms was renamed u
s
sugar and this produced <num> percent of everglades sugar
during the <num> the sugarcane farmers coalition came under investigation for labor practices that bordered on slavery
potential employees — primarily young black men — were lured from all over the u
s
by the promise of jobs but they were held financially responsible for training transportation room and board and other costs
quitting while debts were owed was punishable with jail time
by <year> u
s
sugar was indicted for peonage in federal court though the charges were eventually dismissed on a technicality
u
s
sugar benefited significantly from the u
s
embargo on cuban goods beginning in the early <num>
in <year> before the castro regime <num> @,@ <num> acres <num> km2 of sugarcane were harvested in florida by the <year> – <year> season <num> @,@ <num> acres <num> km2 were harvested
from <year> to <year> the region went from two sugar mills to six one of which in belle glade set several world records for sugar production
fields in the eaa are typically <num> acres <num> ha on two sides bordered by canals that are connected to larger ones by which water is pumped in or out depending on the needs of the crops
the water level for sugarcane is ideally maintained at <num> inches <num> cm below the surface soil and after the cane is harvested the stalks are burned
vegetables require more fertilizer than sugarcane though the fields may resemble the historic hydrology of the everglades by being flooded in the wet season
sugarcane however requires water in the dry season
the fertilizers used on vegetables along with high concentrations of nitrogen and phosphorus that are the by @-@ product of decayed soil necessary for sugarcane production were pumped into wcas south of the eaa predominantly to everglades national park
the introduction of large amounts of these let exotic plants take hold in the everglades
one of the defining characteristics of natural everglades ecology is its ability to support itself in a nutrient @-@ poor environment and the introduction of fertilizers began to change this ecology
developers began acquiring land paying <num> an acre in <year> and the dade county port authority dcpa bought <num> square miles <num> km2 in the big cypress swamp without consulting the c sf management of everglades national park or the department of the interior
park management learned of the official purchase and agreement to build the jetport from the miami herald the day it was announced
the dcpa bulldozed the land it had bought and laid a single runway it declared was for training pilots
the new jetport was planned to be larger than o 'hare dulles jfk and lax airports combined the location chosen was <num> miles <num>
<num> km north of the everglades national park within wca <num>
the deputy director of the dcpa declared this is going to be one of the great population centers of america
we will do our best to meet our responsibilities and the responsibilities of all men to exercise dominion over the land sea and air above us as the higher order of man intends
the c sf brought the jetport proposal to national attention by mailing letters about it to <num> conservation groups in the u
s
initial local press reaction condemned conservation groups who immediately opposed the project
business week reported real estate prices jumped from <num> to <num> an acre surrounding the planned location and life wrote of the expectations of the commercial interests in the area
the u
s
geological survey 's study of the environmental impact of the jetport started development of the proposed jetport and its attendant facilities
will inexorably destroy the south florida ecosystem and thus the everglades national park
the jetport was intended to support a community of a million people and employ <num> @,@ <num>
the dcpa director was reported in time saying i 'm more interested in people than alligators
this is the ideal place as far as aviation is concerned
when studies indicated the proposed jetport would create <num> @,@ <num> @,@ <num> us gallons <num> @,@ <num> @,@ <num> l of raw sewage a day and <num> @,@ <num> short tons <num> @,@ <num> t of jet engine pollutants a year the national media snapped to attention
science magazine wrote in a series on environmental protection highlighting the jetport project environmental scientists have become increasingly aware that without careful planning development of a region and the conservation of its natural resources do not go hand in hand
the new york times called it a blueprint for disaster and wisconsin senator gaylord nelson wrote to president richard nixon voicing his opposition it is a test of whether or not we are really committed in this country to protecting our environment
governor claude kirk withdrew his support for the project and the <num> @-@ year @-@ old marjory stoneman douglas was persuaded to go on tour to give hundreds of speeches against it
she established friends of the everglades and encouraged more than <num> @,@ <num> members to join
initially the u
s
department of transportation pledged funds to support the jetport but after pressure nixon overruled the department
he instead established big cypress national preserve announcing it in the special message to the congress outlining the <year> environmental program
following the jetport proposition restoration of the everglades became not only a statewide priority but an international one as well
in the <num> the everglades were declared an international biosphere reserve and a world heritage site by unesco and a wetland of international importance by the ramsar convention making it one of only three locations on earth that have appeared on all three lists
it began operation in the united states in <year>
it was owned by dumont laboratories a television equipment and set manufacturer
the network was hindered by the prohibitive cost of broadcasting by regulations imposed by the federal communications commission fcc which restricted the company 's growth and even by the company 's partner paramount pictures
despite several innovations in broadcasting and the creation of one of television 's biggest stars of the <num> jackie gleason the network never found itself on solid financial ground
forced to expand on uhf channels during an era when uhf was not yet a standard feature on television sets dumont fought an uphill battle for program clearances outside of their three owned @-@ and @-@ operated stations in new york washington and pittsburgh finally ending network operations in <year>
dumont 's latter @-@ day obscurity caused mainly by the destruction of its extensive program archive by the <num> has prompted tv historian david weinstein to refer to it as the forgotten network or network is long gone
a few popular dumont programs such as cavalcade of stars and emmy award winner life is worth living appear in television retrospectives or are mentioned briefly in books about u
s
television history
allen b
dumont with only <num> @,@ <num> and a laboratory in his basement
he and his staff were responsible for many early technical innovations including the first consumer all @-@ electronic television set in <year>
the company 's television sets soon became the gold standard of the industry
in <year> dumont worked with the army in developing radar technology during world war ii
this ended up bringing in <num> million in capital for the company
early sales of television sets were hampered by the lack of regularly scheduled programming being broadcast
a few months after selling his first set in <year> dumont opened his own new york area experimental television station w2xvt in passaic new jersey
in <year> the station moved to manhattan as w2xwv on channel <num>
unlike cbs and nbc which reduced their hours of television broadcasting during world war ii dumont continued full @-@ scale experimental and commercial broadcasts throughout the war
in <year> w2xwv became wabd callsign derived from dumont 's initials moving to channel <num> in <year> the third commercial television station in new york
on may <num> <year> dumont opened experimental w3xwt in washington dc
a minority shareholder in dumont laboratories was paramount pictures which had advanced <num> @,@ <num> in <year> for a <num> share in the company
paramount had television interests of its own having launched experimental stations in los angeles in <year> and chicago in <year> and dumont 's association with paramount ultimately proved to be a mistake
soon after his experimental washington station signed on dumont began experimental coaxial cable hookups between his laboratories in passaic new jersey and his two stations
it is said that one of those broadcasts on the hookup announced that the u
s
had dropped an atomic bomb on nagasaki japan on august <num> <year>
this was later considered to be the official beginning of the dumont network by both thomas t
goldsmith the network 's chief engineer and dumont 's best friend and dumont himself
regular network service began on august <num> <year> on wabd and w3xwt
in <year> w3xwt became wttg named after goldsmith
the pair were joined in <year> by wdtv channel <num> in pittsburgh
although nbc in new york was known to have station @-@ to @-@ station television links as early as <year> with wptz now kyw in philadelphia and wrgb schenectady ny dumont received its station licenses before nbc resumed its previously sporadic network broadcasts after the war
abc had just come into existence as a radio network in <year> and did not enter network television until <year> when it signed on a flagship station in new york city wjz @-@ tv now wabc @-@ tv
cbs also waited until <year> to begin network operations because it was waiting for the federal communications commission to approve its color television system which it eventually did not
other companies – including mutual the yankee network and paramount itself – were interested in starting television networks but were prevented from successfully doing so by restrictive fcc regulations however at least the paramount television network actually did have some limited success in network operations in the late <num> and early <num>
without the radio revenues that supported mighty nbc and cbs dumont programmers relied on their wits and on connections with broadway
eventually the network provided original programs that are remembered more than <num> years later
the network largely ignored the standard business model of <num> tv in which one advertiser sponsored an entire show enabling it to have complete control over its content
instead dumont sold commercials to many different advertisers freeing producers of its shows from the veto power held by sole sponsors
this eventually became the standard model for us television
some commercial time was sold regionally on a co @-@ op basis while other spots were sold network @-@ wide
dumont also holds another important place in american tv history
wdtv 's sign @-@ on made it possible for stations in the midwest to receive live network programming from stations on the east coast and vice versa
before then the networks relied on separate regional networks in the two time zones for live programming and the west coast received network programming from kinescopes films shot directly from live television screens originating from the east coast
on january <num> <year> the coaxial cable linking east and midwest known in television circles as the golden spike in reference to the golden spike that united the first transcontinental railroad was activated
the ceremony hosted by dumont and wdtv was carried on all four networks
wgn @-@ tv channel <num> in chicago and wabd in new york were able to share programs through a live coaxial cable feed when wdtv signed on in pittsburgh because the station completed the east coast @-@ to @-@ midwest chain allowing stations in both regions to air the same program simultaneously which is still the standard for us tv
it was another two years before the west coast got live programming from the east and the east able to get live programming from the west but this was the beginning of the modern era of network television
the first broadcasts came from dumont 's <num> madison avenue headquarters and it soon found additional space including a fully functioning theater in the new york branch of wanamaker 's department store at ninth street and broadway
later a lease on the adelphi theatre on <num> street and the ambassador theatre on west <num> street gave the network a site for variety shows and in <year> the lavish dumont tele @-@ centre opened in the former jacob ruppert 's central opera house at <num> east <num> street
dumont was the first network to broadcast a film production for tv talk fast mister produced by rko in <year>
dumont also aired the first tv situation comedy mary kay and johnny as well as the first network @-@ televised soap opera faraway hill
cavalcade of stars a variety show hosted by jackie gleason was the birthplace of the honeymooners gleason took his variety show to cbs in <year> but filmed the classic <num> honeymooners episodes at dumont 's adelphi theater studio in <year> @-@ <num>
bishop fulton j
sheen 's devotional program life is worth living went up against milton berle in many cities and was the first show to compete successfully in the ratings against mr
television
in <year> sheen won an emmy award for most outstanding personality
the network 's other notable programs include ted mack 's the original amateur hour which began on radio in the <num> under original host edward bowes the morey amsterdam show a comedy variety show hosted by morey amsterdam which started on cbs before moving to dumont in <year> captain video and his video rangers a hugely popular kids science fiction series the arthur murray party a dance program down you go a popular panel show rocky king inside detective a private eye series starring roscoe karns the plainclothesman a camera 's @-@ eye @-@ view detective series live coverage of boxing and professional wrestling the latter featuring matches staged by the capitol wrestling corporation the predecessor to wwe the johns hopkins science review a peabody award @-@ winning education program cash and carry the first network @-@ televised game show the ernie kovacs show the first truly innovative show in what was then visual radio not television
the network was a pioneer in tv programming aimed at minority audiences and featuring minority performers at a time when the other american networks aired few television series for non @-@ whites
among dumont 's minority programs were the gallery of madame liu @-@ tsong starring asian american film actress anna may wong the first us tv show to star an asian american and the hazel scott show starring pianist and singer hazel scott the first us network tv series to be hosted by a black woman
although dumont 's programming pre @-@ dated videotape many dumont offerings were recorded on kinescopes
these kinescopes were said to be stored in a warehouse until the <num>
actress edie adams the wife of comedian ernie kovacs both regular performers on early television testified in <year> before a panel of the library of congress on the preservation of television and video
adams claimed that so little value was given to these films that the stored kinescopes were loaded into three trucks and dumped into upper new york bay
nevertheless a number of dumont programs survive at the paley center for media in new york city the ucla film and television archive in los angeles in the peabody awards collection at the university of georgia and the museum of broadcast communications in chicago
although nearly the entire dumont film archive was destroyed several surviving dumont shows have been released on dvd
a large number of episodes of life is worth living have been saved and they are now aired weekly on catholic @-@ oriented cable network the eternal word television network which also makes a collection of them available on dvd in the biographical information about fulton j
sheen added to the end of many episodes a still image of bishop sheen looking into a dumont television camera can be seen
several companies that distribute dvds over the internet have released a small number of episodes of cavalcade of stars and the morey amsterdam show
two more dumont programs captain video and his video rangers and rocky king inside detective have had a small amount of surviving episodes released commercially by at least one major distributor of public domain programming
most awards during the <num> went to nbc and cbs who were able to out @-@ spend other companies and draw on their extensive history of radio broadcasting in the relatively new television medium
dumont however did win a number of awards during its years of operation
during the <year> – <num> tv season bishop fulton j
sheen host of life is worth living won an emmy award for most outstanding personality
sheen beat out cbs 's arthur godfrey edward r
murrow and lucille ball who were also nominated for the same award
sheen was also nominated for – but did not win – consecutive public service emmys in <year> <year> and <year>
dumont received an emmy nomination for down you go a popular game show during the <year> – <num> television season in the category best audience participation quiz or panel program
the network was nominated twice for its coverage of professional football during the <year> – <num> and <year> – <num> television seasons
the johns hopkins science review a dumont public affairs program was awarded a peabody award in <year> in the education category
sheen 's emmy and the science review peabody were the only national awards the dumont network received
though dumont series and performers continued to win local tv awards by the mid @-@ <num> the dumont network no longer had a national presence
e
hooper company of new york
dumont performed well in the hooper ratings in fact dumont 's talent program the original amateur hour was the most popular series of the <year> – <num> season
variety ranked dumont 's popular variety series cavalcade of stars as the tenth most popular series two seasons later
in february <year> hooper 's competitor a
c
nielsen bought out the hooperatings system
dumont did not fare well with the change none of its shows appeared on nielsen 's annual top <num> lists of the most popular series
one of the dumont network 's biggest hits of the <num> life is worth living received nielsen ratings of up to <num>
<num> attracting more than <num> million viewers
sheen 's one @-@ man program – in which he discussed philosophy psychology and other fields of thought from a christian perspective – was the most widely viewed religious series in the history of television
<num> local television stations aired life and for three years the program competed successfully against nbc 's popular the milton berle show
the abc and cbs programs which aired in the same timeslot were cancelled
life is worth living was not the only dumont program to achieve double @-@ digit ratings
in <year> time magazine reported that popular dumont game show down you go had attracted an audience estimated at <num> million viewers
similarly dumont 's summer <year> replacement series the goldbergs achieved audiences estimated at <num> million
still these series were only moderately popular compared to nbc 's and cbs 's highest @-@ rated programs
nielsen was not the only company to report tv ratings however
companies such as trendex videodex and arbitron had also measured tv viewership
the adjacent chart comes from videodex 's august <year> ratings breakdown as reported in billboard magazine
during the <num> and <num> television signals were sent between stations via coaxial cable and microwave links which were owned by at t
the service provider did not have enough cable lines and microwave circuits to provide signal relay service from all four networks to all of their affiliates at the same time so at t allocated times when each network could offer live programs to their affiliates
in <year> at t allotted nbc and cbs each over <num> hours of live prime time network service but gave abc only <num> hours and dumont just <num>
at t also required each television network to lease both radio and television lines
dumont was the only television network without a radio network but was forced to pay for a service it did not use
dumont protested at t 's actions with the federal communications commission and eventually received a compromise
dumont 's biggest corporate hurdle however may have been with the company 's own partner paramount
relations between the two companies were strained as early as <year> when paramount opened experimental television stations in los angeles and chicago without dumont
dr
dumont claimed that the original <year> acquisition proposal required paramount to expand its television interests through dumont
paramount representative paul raibourn who also was a member of dumont 's board of directors denied that any such restriction had ever been discussed dr
dumont was vindicated on this point by a <year> examination of the original draft document
dumont aspired to grow beyond its three stations applying for new television station licenses in cincinnati and cleveland in <year>
this would give the network five owned @-@ and @-@ operated stations o os the maximum allowed by the fcc at the time
however dumont was hampered by paramount 's two stations ktla channel <num> in los angeles and wbkb channel <num> now wbbm @-@ tv on channel <num> in chicago – the descendants of the two experimental stations that rankled dumont in <year>
although these stations never carried dumont programming with the exception of ktla for one year from <year> to <year> and in fact competed against dumont 's affiliates in those cities the fcc ruled that paramount essentially controlled dumont which effectively placed the network at the five @-@ station cap
paramount 's exertion of influence over the network 's management and the power of its voting stock brought the fcc to its conclusion
thus dumont was unable to open additional stations as long as paramount owned stations or owned a portion of dumont
paramount refused to sell
in <year> paramount pictures launched the paramount television network a service which provided local television stations with filmed television programs paramount 's network undercut the company that it had invested in
paramount did not share its stars big budgets or filmed programs with dumont the company had stopped financially supporting dumont in <year>
although paramount executives indicated they would produce programs for dumont the studio never supplied the network with programs or technical assistance
the acrimonious relationship between paramount and dumont came to a head during the <year> fcc hearings regarding the abc – united paramount theaters merger when paul raibourn an executive at paramount publicly derided the quality of dumont television sets in court testimony
most early television licenses were granted to established radio broadcasters and many longtime relationships with radio networks carried over to the new medium
as cbs and nbc and to a lesser extent abc gained their footing they began to offer programming that drew on their radio backgrounds bringing over the most popular radio stars
early television station owners when deciding which network would receive their main affiliation were more likely to choose cbs 's roster of lucille ball jack benny and ed sullivan or nbc 's lineup of milton berle and sid caesar over dumont which offered a then @-@ unknown jackie gleason and bishop fulton j
sheen
in smaller markets with a limited number of stations dumont and abc were often relegated to secondary status so their programs got clearance only if the primary network was off the air or delayed via kinescope recording teletranscriptions in dumont parlance
adding to dumont 's troubles was the fcc 's <year> freeze on television license applications
this was done to sort out the thousands of applications that had come streaming in but also to rethink the allocation and technical standards laid down prior to world war ii
it became clear soon after the war that <num> channels channel <num> had been removed from television broadcasting use because storms and other types of interference could severely affect the quality of signals on this channel were not nearly enough for national television service
what was to be a six @-@ month freeze lasted until <year> when the fcc opened the uhf spectrum
the fcc however did not require television manufacturers to include uhf capability
in order to see uhf stations most people had to buy an expensive converter
even then the picture quality was marginal at best
tied to this was a decision to restrict vhf allocations in medium- and smaller @-@ sized markets
television sets were not required to have all @-@ channel tuning until <year>
forced to rely on uhf to expand dumont saw one station after another go dark due to dismal ratings
it bought small distressed uhf station kcty channel <num> in kansas city missouri in <year> but ran it for just three months before shutting it down at a considerable loss after attempting to compete with three established vhf stations
the fcc 's dr
hyman goldin said in <year> if there had been four vhf outlets in the top markets there 's no question dumont would have lived and would have eventually turned the corner in terms of profitability
s
television networks
however as television grew into a profitable business an intense rivalry developed between the networks just as it had in radio
nbc and cbs competed fiercely for viewers and advertising dollars a contest neither underfunded dumont nor abc could hope to win
according to author dennis mazzocco nbc tried to make an arrangement with abc and cbs to destroy the dumont network
the plan was for nbc and cbs to exclusively offer abc their most popular series after they had aired on the bigger networks
abc would become a network of re @-@ runs but dumont would be shut out
abc president leonard goldenson rejected nbc executive david sarnoff 's proposal but did not report it to the justice department
dumont survived the early <num> only because of wdtv in pittsburgh the lone commercial vhf station in what was then the sixth @-@ largest market
wdtv 's only competition came from uhf stations and distant stations from johnstown pennsylvania youngstown ohio and wheeling west virginia
no other commercial vhf station signed on in pittsburgh until <year> giving wdtv a de facto monopoly on television in the area
since wdtv carried secondary affiliations with the other three networks dumont used this as a bargaining chip to get its programs cleared in other large markets
despite its severe financial straits by <year> dumont appeared to be on its way to establishing itself as the third national network
dumont programs aired live on <num> stations but it could count on only seven primary stations – its three owned @-@ and @-@ operated stations o os plus wgn @-@ tv in chicago kttv channel <num> in los angeles kfel @-@ tv channel <num> now kwgn @-@ tv in denver and wtvn @-@ tv channel <num> now wsyx in columbus ohio
in contrast abc had a full complement of five o os augmented by nine primary affiliates
abc also had a radio network it was descended from nbc 's blue network from which to draw talent affiliate loyalty and a profit stream to subsidize television operations
however abc had only <num> primary stations while cbs and nbc had over <num> each
by <year> abc was badly overextended and on the verge of bankruptcy
that year the company announced a merger with united paramount theaters the former theater division of paramount pictures which was spun off as a result of the united states v
paramount pictures inc
antitrust decision but it was not until <year> that the fcc approved the merger
by this time dumont had begun to differentiate itself from nbc and cbs
it allowed its advertisers to choose the locations where their advertising ran potentially saving them millions of dollars
by contrast abc operated like cbs and nbc even though it was only a fourth as large forcing advertisers to purchase a large must @-@ buy list of stations
abc 's fortunes were dramatically altered in february <year> when the fcc cleared the way for upt to buy the network
the merger provided abc with a badly needed cash infusion giving it the resources to mount top shelf programming and to provide a national television service on a scale approaching that of cbs and nbc
through upt president leonard goldenson abc also gained ties with the hollywood studios that more than matched those dumont 's producers had with broadway
realizing that the abc @-@ upt deal put dumont near extinction network officials were receptive to a merger offer from abc
goldenson quickly brokered a deal with ted bergmann dumont 's managing director under which the merged network would have been called abc @-@ dumont until at least <year> and would have honored all of dumont 's network commitments
in return dumont would get <num> million in cash guaranteed advertising time for dumont sets and a secure future for its staff
a merged abc @-@ dumont would have been a colossus rivaling cbs and nbc as it would have owned stations in five of the six largest u
s
television markets excluding only philadelphia as well as abc 's radio network
it also would have inherited dumont 's de facto monopoly in pittsburgh and would have been one of two networks to have full ownership of a station in the nation 's capital the other being nbc
however it would have had to sell a new york station – either dumont 's wabd or abc flagship wjz @-@ tv channel <num> now wabc @-@ tv probably the former
it also would have had to sell two other stations – most likely abc 's two smallest o os wxyz @-@ tv in detroit and kgo @-@ tv in san francisco both broadcasting on channel <num> – to get under the fcc 's limit of five stations per owner
however paramount vetoed the plan almost out of hand due to antitrust concerns
a few months earlier the fcc had ruled that paramount controlled dumont and there were still some questions about whether upt had really separated from paramount
with no other way to readily obtain cash dumont sold wdtv to westinghouse electric corporation for <num>
<num> million in late <year>
while this gave dumont a short @-@ term cash infusion it eliminated the leverage the network had to get program clearances in other markets
without its de facto monopoly in pittsburgh the company 's advertising revenue shrank to less than half that of <year>
by february <year> dumont executives realized the company could not continue as a television network
the decision was made to shut down network operations and operate wabd and wttg as independent stations
on april <num> <year> most of dumont 's entertainment programs were dropped
bishop sheen aired his last program on dumont on april <num> and later moved to abc
by may just eight programs were left on the network with only inexpensive shows and sporting events keeping what was left of the network going through the summer
the network also largely abandoned the use of the intercity network coaxial cable on which it had spent <num> million in <year> to transmit shows that mostly lacked station clearance
the company only retained network links for live sports programming and utilizing the company 's electronicam process to produce studio @-@ based programming
ironically electronicam is best remembered for being used by jackie gleason 's producers for the <num> @-@ half @-@ hour episodes of the honeymooners that aired on cbs during the <year> @-@ <num> television season
in august paramount with the help of other stockholders seized full control of dumont laboratories
the last non @-@ sports program on dumont the game show what 's the story aired on september <num> <year>
after that dumont 's network feed was used only for occasional sporting events
dumont 's last broadcast a boxing match aired on august <num> <year>
the date has also been reported as april <year> september <year> or august <num> <year>
according to one source the final program aired on only five stations nationwide
it appears that the boxing show was syndicated to a few other east coast stations until <year> but likely not as a production of dumont or its successor company
dumont spun off wabd and wttg as the dumont broadcasting corporation
the name was later changed to metropolitan broadcasting company to distance the company from what was seen as a complete failure
in <year> john kluge bought paramount 's shares for <num> million and renamed the company metromedia in <year>
wabd became wnew @-@ tv and later wnyw wttg still broadcasts under its original call letters as a fox affiliate
for <num> years dumont was the only major broadcast television network to cease operations until cbs corporation and time warner shut down two other struggling networks upn and the wb in september <year> to create the cw television network – whose schedule was originally composed largely of programs from both of its predecessor networks
of the three only washington 's wttg still has its original call letters
wttg and new york 's wabd later wnew @-@ tv and now wnyw survived as metromedia @-@ owned independents until <year> when metromedia was purchased by the news corporation to form the nucleus of the new fox broadcasting company
clarke ingram who maintained a dumont memorial site has suggested that fox can be considered a revival or at least a linear descendant of dumont
westinghouse changed wdtv 's call letters to kdka @-@ tv after the pioneering radio station of the same name and switched its primary affiliation to cbs immediately after the sale
westinghouse 's acquisition of cbs in <year> made kdka @-@ tv a cbs owned @-@ and @-@ operated station
because the shows were created prior to the launch of ampex 's electronic videotape recorder in late <year> all of them were initially broadcast live in black and white then recorded on film kinescope for reruns and for west coast rebroadcasts
by the early <num> their vast library of <num> and <num> kinescopes eventually wound up in the hands of a successor network who reportedly disposed of all of them in new york city 's east river to make room for more recent @-@ vintage videotapes in a warehouse
other kinescopes were put through a silver reclaiming process because of the microscopic amounts of silver that made up the emulsion of black @-@ and @-@ white film during this time
it is estimated that only about <num> complete dumont television shows survive today the most famous being virtually all of jackie gleason 's honeymooners comedy sketches
most of the existing episodes are believed to have come from the personal archives of dumont 's hosts such as gleason and dennis james
in those days television stations were free to cherry @-@ pick which programs they would air and many stations affiliated with multiple networks depending mainly on the number of commercial television stations available in a market at a given time markets where only one commercial station was available carried programming from all four major networks
many of dumont 's affiliates carried very little dumont programming choosing to air one or two more popular programs such as life is worth living and or sports programming on the weekends
few stations carried the full dumont program lineup
in its later years dumont was carried mostly on poorly watched uhf channels or had only secondary affiliations on vhf stations
dumont ended most operations on april <num> <year> but honored network commitments until august <year>
s
a bodyline delivery was one where the cricket ball was bowled towards the body of the batsman on the line of the leg stump in the hope of creating leg @-@ side deflections that could be caught by one of several fielders in the quadrant of the field behind square leg
this was considered by many to be intimidatory and physically threatening to the point of being unfair in a game once supposed to have gentlemanly traditions although commercialisation of the game had subsequently tended to elevate the principle of win at all costs above traditional ideals of sportsmanship
although no serious injuries arose from any short @-@ pitched deliveries while a leg theory field was set the tactic still led to considerable ill feeling between the two teams with the controversy eventually spilling into the diplomatic arena
over the next two decades several of the laws of cricket were changed to prevent this tactic being repeated
law <num>
<num> states at the instant of the bowler 's delivery there shall not be more than two fielders other than the wicket @-@ keeper behind the popping crease on the on side commonly referred to as being behind square leg
additionally law <num>
<num> a includes the bowling of fast short pitched balls is dangerous and unfair if the umpire at the bowler 's end considers that by their repetition and taking into account their length height and direction they are likely to inflict physical injury on the striker
the occasional short @-@ pitched ball aimed at the batsman a bouncer has never been illegal and is still in widespread use as a tactic
australia won the five @-@ test series <num> – <num> with don bradman scoring <num> runs at a batting average of <num>
<num> an aggregate record that still stands
by the time of the next ashes series of <year> – <num> bradman 's average hovered around <num> approximately twice that of all other world @-@ class batsmen
england feared that without resorting to drastic tactics they might not be able to defeat australia until bradman — then aged <num> — retired something that might be over a decade away
it was believed that something new was required to combat bradman but it was believed more likely that bradman could be dismissed by leg @-@ spin as walter robins and ian peebles had supposedly caused him problems two leg @-@ spinners were included in the english touring party of <year> – <num>
this view gradually came to change leading up to <year>
the idea of bodyline had originated in the oval test of the <year> ashes series
while bradman was batting the wicket became briefly difficult following rain
bradman was seen to be uncomfortable facing deliveries which bounced higher than usual at a faster pace being seen to step back out of the line of the ball
former england player and surrey captain percy fender was one who noticed and the incident was much discussed by cricketers
however given that bradman scored <num> it was not thought that a way to curb his prodigious scoring had been found
when douglas jardine later saw film footage of the oval incident and noticed bradman 's discomfort he shouted i 've got it he 's yellow further details adding to the plan came from letters fender received from australia in <year> which described how australian batsmen were increasingly moving across the stumps towards the off side to play the ball on the on side
fender showed these letters to jardine when it became clear that he was to captain mcc in australia during the <year> – <num> tour and he also discussed bradman 's discomfort at the oval
it was also known in england that bradman was dismissed for a four @-@ ball duck by fast bowler eddie gilbert and looked very uncomfortable
bradman had also appeared uncomfortable against the pace of sandy bell in his innings of <num> not out at the adelaide oval in south africa 's tour of australia earlier in <year> when the desperate bowler decided to bowl short to him and fellow south african herbie taylor according to jack fingleton may have mentioned this to english cricketers in <year>
fender felt bradman might be vulnerable to fast short @-@ pitched deliveries on the line of leg stump
jardine felt that bradman was afraid to stand his ground against intimidatory bowling citing instances in <year> when he shuffled about contrary to orthodox batting technique
when jardine was appointed england 's captain for the <year> – <num> english tour of australia a meeting was arranged with nottinghamshire captain arthur carr and his two fast bowlers harold larwood and bill voce at london 's piccadilly hotel to discuss a plan to combat bradman 's extraordinary skills
jardine asked larwood and voce if they could bowl on leg stump and make the ball come up into the body of the batsman
the bowlers agreed they could and that it might prove effective
jardine also visited frank foster who had toured australia in <year> – <num> to discuss field @-@ placing in australia
foster had bowled leg @-@ theory on that tour with his fielders placed close in on the leg side as had george hirst in <year> – <num>
a cordon of close @-@ in fielders would be arrayed behind the wicket and on the leg side to exploit batting errors elicited by this bowling line
in these circumstances a batsman can either duck and risk being hit or play the ball
defensive shots rarely score runs and risk being caught in the cordon while the pull and hook shots can result in a catch on the boundary for which two men were usually set in leg @-@ theory bowling
leg theory had been practised previously without resort to short @-@ pitched bowling usually by slow or medium @-@ pace bowlers
this type of leg theory was aimed outside the line of leg stump the object being to test the batsman 's patience and force a rash stroke
it was occasionally an effective tactic but was unattractive for spectators and never became widely used except by a handful of specialists such as fred root the worcestershire bowler and warwick armstrong the former australian captain
however there had been instances of what would later be recognised as bodyline prior to <year>
in <year> australian jack scott first bowled a form of bodyline in a state match for new south wales but his captain herbie collins disliked it and would not let him use it again when he was captain
other australian captains were less particular including vic richardson who let him use those tactics when he moved to south australia
he repeated them against the mcc in <year> – <num>
in <year> in a test trial match nobby clark bowled short to a leg @-@ trap field
he was representing england in a side captained by jardine
in <year> – <num> harry alexander bowled an early form of bodyline at the mcc tourists
larwood used a form of bodyline on that same tour bowling fast leg theory to a leg @-@ side field in two test matches although not with the same intensity and duration as came later
bob wyatt later claimed that learie constantine unsuccessfully used bodyline in <year> – <num> in the west indies
larwood and voce practised the plan over the remainder of the <year> season with varying but increasing success and several injuries to batsmen
ken farnes experimented with short @-@ pitched leg @-@ theory bowling but was not selected for the tour
bill bowes also used short @-@ pitched bowling notably against jack hobbs
in the second innings jardine was <num> not out when the game ended having batted his team to safety
the tourists were criticised in the press for not allowing jardine to reach his hundred but they had tried to help him with some easy bowling
there has been speculation that this incident helped develop jardine 's antipathy towards australians although christopher douglas denies this
cricket historian david frith believed it is possible that the abrasive australian captain warwick armstrong could have addressed sarcastic comments to jardine but wisden believed his slow approach cost him his century
regardless of what happened in <year> jardine 's conflicts with australia solidified after he was selected to tour the country in <year> – <num>
he began the tour with three consecutive hundreds
during the first century the crowd engaged in some good @-@ natured joking at jardine 's expense but he was jeered by the crowd during his second hundred for batting too slowly
jardine accelerated after another slow start during which he was again barracked to score his third century
the crowds took an increasing dislike to him mainly for his superior attitude and bearing his awkward fielding and particularly his choice of headwear
his first public action in south australia was to take out the members of the south australian team who had been to oxford or cambridge universities
then he wore a harlequin cap given to successful cricketers at oxford
it was not unusual for oxford and cambridge cricketers to wear similar caps while batting as both jardine and mcc captain percy chapman did so on this tour although it was slightly unorthodox to wear them while fielding
however this was neither understood nor acceptable to the australian crowds
they quickly took exception to the importance he seemed to place on class distinction
although jardine may simply have worn the cap out of superstition it conveyed a negative impression to the spectators his general demeanour drew one comment of where 's the butler to carry the bat for you jardine 's cap became a focus for criticism and mockery from the crowds throughout the tour
nevertheless jack fingleton later claimed that jardine could have won over the crowd by exchanging jokes or pleasantries with them
it is certain that jardine by this stage had developed an intense dislike for australian crowds
during his third century at the start of the tour during a period of abuse from the spectators he observed to a sympathetic hunter hendry that all australians are uneducated and an unruly mob
after the innings when teammate patsy hendren remarked that the australian crowds did not like jardine he replied it 's fucking mutual
during the tour jardine fielded next to the crowd on the boundary
there he was roundly abused and mocked for his awkward fielding particularly when chasing the ball
on one occasion he spat towards the crowd while fielding on the boundary as he changed position for the final time
during the journey to australia some players reported that jardine told them to hate the australians in order to defeat them while instructing them to refer to bradman as the little bastard
at this stage he seemed to have settled on leg theory if not full bodyline as his main tactic
once the team arrived in australia jardine quickly alienated the press by refusing to give team details before a match and being uncooperative during interviews
the press printed some negative stories as a result and the crowds barracked as they had done on his previous tour which angered him
jardine was rested from that match and his deputy bob wyatt deployed the full bodyline tactics for the first time on the tour
the match was drawn and woodfull struggled making <num> and a duck
utilising his hopping technique and attempting to play unorthodox shots resembling overhead tennis smashes bradman failed to make an impact and england were buoyed ahead of the tests
seeing the bruising balls hit the australian batsmen on several occasions in this game and the next angered the spectators
the english players and management were consistent in referring to their tactic as fast leg theory considering it to be a variant of the established and unobjectionable leg theory tactic
the inflammatory term bodyline was coined and perpetuated by the australian press see below
english writers used the term fast leg theory
the terminology reflected differences in understanding as neither the english public nor the board of the marylebone cricket club mcc — the governing body of english cricket — could understand why the australians were complaining about what they perceived as a commonly used tactic
some concluded that the australian cricket authorities and public were sore losers
of the four fast bowlers in the tour party gubby allen was a voice of dissent in the english camp refusing to bowl short on the leg side and writing several letters home to england critical of jardine although he did not express this in public in australia
a number of other players while maintaining a united front in public also deplored bodyline in private
the amateurs bob wyatt the vice @-@ captain freddie brown and the nawab of pataudi opposed it as did walter hammond and les ames among the professionals
during the season woodfull 's physical courage stoic and dignified leadership won him many admirers
he flatly refused to employ retaliatory tactics and did not publicly complain even though he and his men were repeatedly hit
australia lost heavily by ten wickets in the first test at sydney when the bowling spearhead of bodyline harold larwood took ten wickets
bradman missed the first test due to illness although jardine refused to believe this and thought the real reason was that the batsman had suffered a nervous breakdown due to his tactical scheme
the only australian batsman to make an impact was stan mccabe who resolutely stood his ground and impulsively hooked and pulled everything aimed at his upper body undeterred by the prospect of taking a potentially lethal blow to the head
he scored <num> not out in four hours an innings described by leading historian david frith as among the most stirring innings test cricket has ever produced
before the second test in melbourne woodfull had to wait until minutes before the game before he was confirmed as captain by the selectors
this caused the toss to be delayed and fomented speculation that the australian board of control was considering the possibility of removing woodfull because of his absolute refusal to allow his bowlers to use retaliatory tactics
his deputy victor richardson had advocated retaliation along with several other players
richardson recalled woodfull 's private response there is no way i will be influenced to adopt such tactics which bring such discredit to the game
i know tim could do it but i am not going to participate in actions that can only hurt the game
the media advocated the selection of eddie gilbert an indigenous bowler of extreme pace in order to return the bodyline barrage
in one tour match gilbert had bloodied jardine and left a bruise the size of a saucer
another suggested means of retaliation was laurie nash whose notoriously abrasive personality and aggression saw him regarded as a thug
however woodfull was totally unmoved by such suggestions
on the opening day bradman wildly hooked at bill bowes first ball a non @-@ bodyline ball and was dismissed for a golden duck leaving the entire stadium in shock
jardine who was known for being extremely dour even by the standards of the day openly exulted and danced wildly upon bradman 's demise
australia 's eventual victory was met by widespread public jubilation as many believed that australia had found a means of overcoming the tactics
bradman scored a match @-@ winning century in the second innings but it turned out to be his only triple figure score for the series while larwood was hampered by a bloodied foot and a slow pitch
the controversy reached its peak during the second day of the third test
on <num> january an all @-@ time record adelaide oval crowd of <num> @,@ <num> watched australia finish off england 's first innings
shortly after the start of australia 's innings larwood bowling to a conventional field setting struck woodfull an agonising blow under his heart with a short lifting delivery
woodfull was struck when he was bent over his bat and wicket and not when upright as often imagined
as woodfull bent down over his bat in pain for several minutes an image that became one of the defining symbols of the series the huge crowd began jeering hooting and verbally abusing the english team
jardine reacted by saying well bowled harold
tension and feelings ran so high that a riot was narrowly averted as police stationed themselves between the players and enraged spectators
jardine then ordered his team to move to bodyline positions immediately after woodfull 's injury
jardine wrote that larwood had asked for the field while larwood said that it was jardine 's decision
the capacity saturday afternoon crowd viewed this as hitting a man when he was down
journalist – cricketer dick whitington wrote that jardine 's actions were seen as an unforgivable crime in australian eyes and certainly no part of cricket
mass hooting and jeering occurred after almost every ball
whitington noted that umpire george hele believes that had what followed occurred in melbourne the crowd would have leapt the fence and belaboured the english captain larwood and possibly the entire side
some english players later expressed fears that a large @-@ scale riot could break out and that the police would not be able to stop the irate home crowd who were worried that woodfull or bradman could be killed from attacking them
during the over another rising larwood delivery knocked the bat out of woodfull 's hands
he battled it out for <num> minutes collecting more bruises before allen bowled him for <num>
later in the day the english team manager pelham warner visited the australian dressing room to express his sympathies to woodfull
woodfull had remained calm in public refusing to complain about jardine 's tactics
woodfull 's abrupt response was meant to be private but it was leaked to the press the adelaide leak i don 't want to see you mr warner
there are two teams out there one is playing cricket
the other is making no attempt to do so
woodfull reportedly added this game is too good to be spoilt
it 's time some people got out of it hinting that he might withdraw his team from competition in protest
australia 's leo o 'brien later reported that warner was close to tears following woodfull 's rebuke
the leaking to the press of woodfull 's comments to warner angered the australian captain
he had intended the comments to be private and ill feeling grew in the australian camp as speculation about who leaked the incident to the press grew and many of the team privately pointed the finger at bradman
bradman strenuously denied to his dying day that he had been responsible others including plum warner pointed the finger at bradman 's team @-@ mate and journalist jack fingleton
however in his autobiography fingleton claimed that sydney sun reporter claude corbett had received the information from bradman
the next day larwood fractured wicket @-@ keeper bert oldfield 's skull
this occurred when oldfield mis @-@ hit a hook which flew from the top edge off a traditional non @-@ bodyline ball oldfield later admitted it was his fault
as a result of the injuries the costs of insurance cover for players doubled
at the end of the fourth day 's play the australian board of control for cricket sent the following cable to the mcc in london bodyline bowling has assumed such proportions as to menace the best interests of the game making protection of the body by the batsman the main consideration
this is causing intensely bitter feeling between the players as well as injury
in our opinion it is unsportsmanlike
unless stopped at once it is likely to upset the friendly relations existing between australia and england
jardine however insisted his tactic was not designed to cause injury and that he was leading his team in a sportsmanlike and gentlemanly manner arguing that it was up to the australian batsmen to play their way out of trouble
he also secretly sent a telegram of sympathy to oldfield 's wife and arranged for presents to be given to his young daughters
the situation escalated into a diplomatic incident between the countries as the mcc — supported by the british public and still of the opinion that their fast leg theory tactic was harmless — took serious offence at being branded unsportsmanlike and demanded a retraction
many people saw bodyline as fracturing an international relationship that needed to remain strong
jardine and by extension the entire english team threatened to withdraw from the fourth and fifth tests unless the australian board withdrew the accusation of unsporting behaviour
public reaction in both england and australia was outrage directed at the other nation
the governor of south australia alexander hore @-@ ruthven who was in england at the time expressed his concern to british secretary of state for dominion affairs james henry thomas that this would cause a significant impact on trade between the nations
the standoff was settled only when the australian prime minister joseph lyons met with members of the australian board and outlined to them the severe economic hardships that could be caused in australia if the british public boycotted australian trade
given this understanding the board withdrew the allegation of unsportsmanlike behaviour two days before the fourth test thus saving the tour
the english team continued to bowl bodyline in the remaining two tests but slower pitches meant the australians although frequently bruised sustained no further serious injuries
england won the last three tests to take the series <num> – <num>
in the test matches bradman countered bodyline by moving toward the leg side away from the line of the ball and cutting it into the vacant off side field
while this was dubious in terms of batting technique it seemed the best way to cope with the barrage and bradman averaged <num>
<num> in the series an excellent average for most but well short of his career average of <num>
<num> while being struck above the waist by the ball only once
his team @-@ mates fared worse with only stan mccabe scoring a century
this gave the english crowds their first chance to see what all the fuss was about
ken farnes the cambridge university fast bowler also bowled it in the university match hitting a few oxford batsmen
jardine himself had to face bodyline bowling in a test match
the west indian cricket team toured england in <year> and in the second test at old trafford jackie grant their captain decided to try bodyline
he had a couple of fast bowlers manny martindale and learie constantine
facing bodyline tactics for the first time england first suffered falling to <num> for <num> with wally hammond being hit on the chin though he recovered to continue his innings
then jardine himself faced martindale and constantine
jardine never flinched
with les ames finding himself in difficulties jardine said you get yourself down this end les
i 'll take care of this bloody nonsense
he played right back to the bouncers standing on tiptoe and played them with a dead bat sometimes playing the ball one handed for more control
while the old trafford pitch was not as suited to bodyline as the hard australian wickets martindale did take <num> for <num> but constantine only took <num> for <num>
jardine himself made <num> his only test century
in the west indian second innings clark bowled bodyline back to the west indians taking <num> for <num>
the match in the end was drawn but played a large part in turning english opinion against bodyline
the times used the word bodyline without using inverted commas or using the qualification so @-@ called for the first time
wisden also said that most of those watching it for the first time must have come to the conclusion that while strictly within the law it was not nice
in <year> bill woodfull led australia back to england on a tour that had been under a cloud after the tempestuous cricket diplomacy of the previous bodyline series
jardine had retired from international cricket in early <year> after captaining a fraught tour of india and under england 's new captain bob wyatt agreements were put in place so that bodyline would not be used
however there were occasions when the australians felt that their hosts had crossed the mark with tactics resembling bodyline
in a match between the australians and nottinghamshire voce one of the bodyline practitioners of <year> – <num> employed the strategy with the wicket @-@ keeper standing to the leg side and took <num> <num>
in the second innings voce repeated the tactic late in the day in fading light against woodfull and bill brown
of his <num> balls <num> were no lower than head height
woodfull told the nottinghamshire administrators that if voce 's leg @-@ side bowling was repeated his men would leave the field and return to london
he further said that australia would not return to the country in the future
the following day voce was absent ostensibly due to a leg injury
already angered by the absence of larwood the nottinghamshire faithful heckled the australians all day
australia had previously and privately complained that some pacemen had strayed past the agreement in the tests
buggy sent a telegram to his newspaper from the test after a day 's play
as a substitute for in the line of the body he used the term bodyline to keep the cost down and the new term quickly became established
originally the mcc hoped that captains would ensure that the game was played in the correct spirit and passed a resolution that bodyline bowling would breach this spirit
when this proved to be insufficient the mcc passed a law that direct attack bowling was unfair and became the responsibility of the umpires to identify and stop
in <year> the laws were altered to prevent more than two fielders standing behind square on the leg side the intention was to prevent negative bowling tactics whereby off spinners and slow inswing bowlers aimed at the leg stump of batsmen with fielders concentrated on the leg side
however an indirect effect was to make bodyline fields impossible to implement
later law changes under the heading of intimidatory short pitched bowling also restricted the number of bouncers which may be bowled in an over
nevertheless the tactic of intimidating the batsman is still used to an extent that would have been shocking in <year> although it is less dangerous now because today 's players wear helmets and generally far more protective gear
the west indies teams of the <num> which regularly fielded a bowling attack comprising some of the best fast bowlers in cricket history were perhaps the most feared exponents
many argued that it was a scourge on cricket and must be stamped out while some did not see what all the fuss was about
the series has been described as the most controversial period in australian cricket history and voted the most important australian moment by a panel of australian cricket identities
the mcc asked harold larwood to sign an apology to them for his bowling in australia making his selection for england again conditional upon it
larwood was furious at the notion pointing out that he had been following orders from his upper @-@ class captain and that was where any blame should lie
larwood refused never played for england again and became vilified in his own country
douglas jardine always defended his tactics and in the book he wrote about the tour in quest of the ashes described allegations that the england bowlers directed their attack with the intention of causing physical harm as stupid and patently untruthful
the immediate effect of the law change which banned bodyline in <year> was to make commentators and spectators sensitive to the use of short @-@ pitched bowling bouncers became exceedingly rare and bowlers who delivered them were practically ostracised
this attitude ended after the second world war and among the first teams to make extensive use of short @-@ pitched bowling was the australian team captained by bradman between <year> and <year>
other teams soon followed
outside the sport there were significant consequences for anglo @-@ australian relations which remained strained until the outbreak of world war ii made cooperation paramount
business between the two countries was adversely affected as citizens of each country avoided goods manufactured in the other
australian commerce also suffered in british colonies in asia the north china daily news published a pro @-@ bodyline editorial denouncing australians as sore losers
an australian journalist reported that several business deals in hong kong and shanghai were lost by australians because of local reactions
english immigrants in australia found themselves shunned and persecuted by locals and australian visitors to england were treated similarly
in <year> – <num> a statue of prince albert in sydney was vandalised with an ear being knocked off and the word bodyline painted on it
both before and after world war ii numerous satirical cartoons and comedy skits were written mostly in australia based on events of the bodyline tour
generally they poked fun at the english
in <year> australia 's network ten produced a television mini @-@ series titled bodyline dramatising the events of the <year> – <num> english tour of australia
it starred gary sweet as don bradman hugo weaving as douglas jardine jim holt as harold larwood rhys mcconnochie as pelham warner and frank thring as jardine 's mentor lord harris
the series took some liberties with historical accuracy for the sake of drama including a depiction of angry australian fans burning a british flag at the sydney cricket ground an event which was never documented
larwood having emigrated to australia in <year> received several threatening and obscene phone calls after the series aired
the series was widely and strongly attacked by the surviving players for its inaccuracy and sensationalism
to this day the bodyline tour remains one of the most significant events in the history of cricket and strong in the consciousness of many cricket followers
in a poll of cricket journalists commentators and players in <year> the bodyline tour was ranked the most important event in cricket history
it is located in the foothills of the mount lofty ranges around <num> km <num>
<num> mi east @-@ south @-@ east of the adelaide city centre
for the most part the suburb encompasses one long gully with first creek at its centre and waterfall gully road running adjacent to the creek
at the southern end of the gully is first falls the waterfall for which the suburb was named
part of the city of burnside waterfall gully is bounded to the north by the suburb of burnside from the north @-@ east to south @-@ east by cleland conservation park part of the suburb of cleland to the south by crafers west and to the west by leawood gardens and mount osmond
historically waterfall gully was first explored by european settlers in the early @-@ to @-@ mid @-@ <num> century and quickly became a popular location for tourists and picnickers
the government chose to retain control over portions of waterfall gully until <year> when they agreed to place the land under the auspices of the city of burnside
<num> years later the government took back the management of the southern part of waterfall gully designating it as south australia 's first national pleasure resort
today this area remains under state government control and in <year> the waterfall gully reserve as it was then known became part of the larger cleland conservation park
over the years waterfall gully has been extensively logged and early agricultural interests saw the cultivation of a variety of introduced species as crops along with the development of local market gardens and nurseries
attempts to mine the area were largely unsuccessful but the region housed one of the state 's earliest water @-@ powered mills and a weir erected in the early <num> provided for part of the city of burnside 's water supply
today the suburb consists primarily of private residences and parks
the gully itself was discovered soon after the establishment of adelaide and colonel william light the first surveyor general of south australia was said to have decided on the site for adelaide when viewing the plains from the hills near waterfall gully
nevertheless the gully had seen human visitors long before the arrival of the europeans as the native population had lived in the area for up to <num> @,@ <num> years prior to flinders appearance off the south australian coast
travelling across the land of the native kaurna people nganno was wounded in a battle and laid down to die forming the mount lofty ranges
the ears of nganno formed the peaks of mount lofty and mount bonython and the region was referred to as yur @-@ e @-@ billa or the place of the ears
the name of the greater mount lofty parklands yurrebilla was derived from this term while the nearby town of uraidla employs a more corrupted form
although hardy states that the kaurna people did not live in the ranges themselves they did live on the lower slopes
an early settler of the neighbouring suburb of beaumont james milne young described the local kaurnas at every creek and gully you would see their wurlies simple aboriginal homes made out of twigs and grass and their fires at night
often as many as <num> to <num> would be camped in various places
some behind the botanic gardens on the banks of the river some toward the ranges some on the waterfall gully
their main presence demarcated by the use of fire against purchasers of land was on the river torrens and the creeks that flowed into it including waterfall gully 's first creek
the land around waterfall gully provided the original inhabitants with a number of resources
the bark from the local stringybark trees eucalyptus obliqua was used in the construction of winter huts and stones and native timbers were used to form tools
food was also present and cossid moth larvae along with other species of plants and animals were collected
nevertheless there were only a few resources that could only be found on the slopes and both hunting and food gathering would in general have been easier on the rich plains
in making their ascent the party skirted a ravine — described by mr kent as possessing smooth and grassy sides — which is believed by anne hardy to have been waterfall gully
subsequent to barker 's ascent the first settlers who were recorded as having climbed mount lofty were bingham hutchinson and his servant william burt
the pair made three attempts to scale the mount before succeeding and for their first attempt they attempted to traverse waterfall gully
the attempt was unsuccessful but in july <year> hutchinson wrote about the gully through which they had travelled
waterfall gully he wrote had proven difficult as the plants were so thickly grown as to provide a significant barrier to their progress
near the point of surrender hutchinson described how they were agreeably surprised by seeing a wall of rock about fifty or sixty feet fifteen to eighteen metres high which stretched across the ravine and from the top of it leapt the brook which had so long been their companion
the brook was first creek and the waterfall they sighted is today known as first falls
nevertheless hutchinson was not the first to see first falls
the first known recorded sighting of the waterfall by a colonial was that of john william adams an emigrant of hms buffalo in early january <year> who named it adams waterfall
he was traveling with his wife susanna and a party consisting of nicholson 's and breaker 's who had the use of a dray to go into the hills
adams states we were opposite the spot where the eagle on the hill now is and the question was put who would volunteer to go down the hillside to try for water
in <year> francis clark wrote that waterfall gully is the most picturesque place for a picnic that i have ever visited and by the <num> the area had become known throughout adelaide
the use of waterfall gully as picnic spot was facilitated by the decision of the government of the day not to subdivide the area containing the waterfalls
section <num> as it was designated did not enter into private hands and thus members of the public were able to access the area from the nearby suburb of eagle on the hill on mount barker road
the position of the eagle on the hill hotel proved advantageous for this as it permitted visitors to stop by for lunch before walking down the hill in the afternoon
other parts of the waterfall gully area were subdivided though and much of the area was owned by samuel davenport
davenport used the land for timber grazing and the cultivation of various crops including olives and grapes for wine production
other local residents ran market gardens and nurseries
for example local residents wilhelm mügge and his wife auguste schmidt operated one of the best nurseries and market gardens near adelaide and gained a reputation for the cheeses produced from their local dairy farm
along with farming the hills and creek were prized areas for the sawyers and splitters and a number of mines were established in the region from the mid @-@ to @-@ late <num> century
in <year> the first silver @-@ lead manganese and iron mines were established in the area while the <num> saw a minor gold rush — although only small quantities were extracted
of greater success was stone quarrying in chambers gully which began in <year> and increased in scale in <year>
waterfall gully was also the site of burnside 's first secondary industry
in the late <num> thomas cain built a watermill on first creek for john cannan which was then employed to power a sawmill on cannan 's property
cannan operated the mill as the traversbrook mill for approximately two years before selling the venture to a mr
finniss
finniss opted to run the mill as a flour mill instead and the mill was rebuilt and renamed finnissbrook mill
the mill continued to operate under a variety of owners until the late <num> but it was dismantled during the <num> and today only traces of the earthworks remain
during this period the population of the nearby village of burnside was expanding and required a new water supply
first creek — which runs down waterfall gully and enters the river torrens near today 's botanic gardens — was seen as the perfect solution to the water shortage
a weir was built during <year> and <year> and was made to hold approximately two megalitres <num> @,@ <num> us gallons of water
a pipeline was constructed to the reservoir at burnside south and from there the water was used throughout the surrounding area
as a side effect the weir also reduced the volume of water available to the local market gardeners and over many years that aspect of the region disappeared
while the route to the falls from eagle on the hill was on public land the alternative route along the gully was through private properties
nevertheless many visitors chose this route and a combination of public demand and a desire from some of the landowners for improved access to and from their properties — especially from the mügge family — led to pressure to build a road through the gully
although there was opposition from some of the locals the waterfall gully road was built in the late <num>
the completion of the road led to an increase in visitor numbers
rather than a bumpy horse ride visitors could now catch the horse tram to the start of the gully and walk cycle or ride to the falls
to provide for tourists the area gained a number of road @-@ side kiosks and produce stalls and the mügge family erected the two story waterfall hotel along the path
furthermore in <year> the government opened a kiosk at the base of first falls designed in the style of a swiss chalet
the hotel is a private residence today but the kiosk continues to operate
thus it was not until <year> that the remaining land was transferred to the control of the burnside council eventuating largely through the efforts of samuel davenport and g
f
cleland
the land remained under the burnside council 's control until <year> when the waterfall gully reserve was reclaimed by the government as the first national pleasure resort in the state
initially the reserve was placed under the jurisdiction of the national parks advisory board but later it was moved to the tourist bureau before finally becoming part of the national park commission 's portfolio
in <year> much of the area that is today 's cleland conservation park was purchased by the state government largely thanks to the efforts of professor sir john cleland
most of this land was combined in <year> to create the park that extends eastwards up the gully to the summit of mount lofty and northwards to greenhill road
waterfall gully reserve was added to the park in <year>
the gully was severely hit by a number of bushfires in <year> that threatened the area and further bushfires in the early <num> caused considerable damage because of the war effort diverting supplies and personnel from the country fire service cfs
significant floods occurred in <year> and <year> and on the night of <num> november <year> waterfall gully was one of several areas in adelaide to experience severe flooding
waterfall gully was one of the hardest hit suburbs bob stevenson duty officer of the state emergency service ses commented that there 's an area called waterfall gully road in the foothills where one of the creeks comes down and there 's quite a few houses affected there
there was <num> or so houses affected on that one road alone
properties were flooded two bridges nearly collapsed and <num> m <num> ft of road was washed away
burnside council workers the cfs and the ses repaired the initial damage on the night while reconstruction of infrastructure commenced in late november

it contains a number of old ruins walking trails and springs and is home to a significant number of native species
since european settlement the native plant life has been considerably affected with the native manna gum and blue gum woodlands being largely cleared for agricultural uses
the large amount of non @-@ native vegetation in the gully is predominantly the result of the early agriculture although some species were introduced by accident
introduced species include olive trees hawthorn fennel and blackberry
with the reduction of native flora exotic fauna have flourished around the waterfall gully region
these include rabbits blackbirds and starlings
however not all of the native wildlife has been lost — bats in particular gould 's wattled bat can be found in the area as can superb fairy @-@ wrens and adelaide rosellas and a large number of unique australian animals such as kangaroos koalas and possums can be spotted on some of the walking trails

the closest bus route for waterfall gully is the <num> bus provided by the multi @-@ service adelaide metro
waterfall gully road is meandering and in some parts quite narrow
this has led to concerns regarding safety as the road is frequented by both pedestrians and cyclists
after the death of a cyclist in <year> calls for the repair and resurfacing of the road intensified with two petitions being tabled in parliament
the accident also led to a safety audit being conducted by transportsa and although the results were not released to the public at the time it called for an investigation of the entire length of the road

also of note is the high occurrence of religious affiliation <num>

residents in these four suburbs are more affluent than the adelaide average with a high occurrence of incomes over a <num> per week which is also above the average for the city of burnside
a majority of workers are employed in professional or white collar fields
the census area that incorporates waterfall gully has a larger proportion of those in both the younger <num> – <num> and older <num> age ranges than in the city of burnside as a whole and there have been no numerically significant changes in the age distribution between the <year> and <year> censuses
similarly family numbers are also stable with almost no change between <year> and <year>
it is at the south @-@ eastern end of the road in land owned by cleland conservation park
the weir at the bottom of the waterfall was constructed in the late <num> century and was part of adelaide 's early water supply
development in the area has continued since the construction of a restaurant in <year>
developments over recent decades have included improving access to the site upgrading the bridges and the addition of new signage
the waterfall gully restaurant was constructed between <year> and <year> by south australian architects albert selmar conrad and his brother frank and was formally opened by sir day bosanquet on <num> november <year>
built in the style of a swiss chalet the building has been heritage listed since <year> and is reputedly haunted by the ghost of a firefighter who died from burns suffered in <year>
other fire tracks and walking trails wind around the hills that surround waterfall gully branching off from chambers gully woolshed gully or the area around first creek
destinations include crafers eagle on the hill mount lofty mount osmond and the cleland wildlife park located in the cleland conservation park
the tracks have been completely rebuilt and resurfaced in the past ten years and a number of older and more perilous routes have been sealed because of the difficult terrain
many offer views of the city of adelaide as well as the gully itself
one of these is notable for connecting to the <num> @,@ <num> km <num> mi heysen trail and the trails are highly frequented
in federal politics the suburb is part of the division of sturt and has been represented by christopher pyne since <year>
the results shown are from the closest polling station to waterfall gully — which is located outside of the suburb — at st david 's church hall on nearby glynburn road burnside
both electorates have traditionally gone to the liberal party and bragg in particular is regarded as a very safe liberal seat
however in the <year> federal election a strong swing towards the labor party and their candidate mia handshin resulted in the electorate transforming from a safe federal liberal seat into a marginal one
in local government waterfall gully is part of the ward of beaumont within the city of burnside and the current mayor for the district is david parkin
beaumont is currently represented by councilors mark osterstock and anne monceaux
the poem follows a common theme in much of tennyson 's work — that of despondent isolation
the subject of mariana is a woman who continuously laments her lack of connection with society
the isolation defines her existence and her longing for a connection leaves her wishing for death at the end of every stanza
the premise of mariana originates in william shakespeare 's measure for measure but the poem ends before mariana 's lover returns
tennyson 's version was adapted by others including john everett millais and elizabeth gaskell for use in their own works
the poem was well received by critics and it is described by critics as an example of tennyson 's skill at poetry
previously he contributed poems to the work poems by two brothers <year> where his early poems dealing with isolation and memory can be found
the theme was continued in the later collection with poems like mariana ode to memory and others representing the earlier poems
during a visit to the pyrenees during the summer of <year> tennyson sought to give aid to spanish rebels
during that time he was affected by his experience and the influence appears in mariana in the south which was published in <year> it is a later version that follows the idea of the lady of shalott
however mariana like the lady of shallott is more accurately a lyrical narrative
it contains elements of dramatic monologies in that it contains a refrain that carries through the poem as found in oriana and other poems
oriana is completely a dramatic monologue and mariana is not because tennyson represents how the title figure is unable to linguistically control her own poem which reinforces the themes of the poem
this technique is used again in tennyson 's later poem the two voices
the rhyme scheme of the poem abab cddc efef is different than the standard ballad rhyme that serves to contain the poem then allow a free expression
the middle quatrain of the stanzas returns in theme to the beginning in a cyclical pattern while the last quatrain 's lines contain the same words
instead he describes its various aspects as he begins with blackest moss the flower @-@ plots were thickly crusted one and all the rusted nails fell from the knots that held the pear to the gable @-@ wall
the broken sheds looked sad and strange unlifted was the clinking latch weeded and worn the ancient thatch upon the lonely moated grange
she only said my life is dreary he cometh not she said she said i am aweary aweary i would that i were dead lines <num> – <num> the narrator of the poem is disconnected from mariana and he is able to see what she cannot
in particular he is able to describe the sweet heaven whereas mariana refuses to take in the scene as well as she is unable to understand the movement of time her tears fell with the dews at even her tears fell ere the dews were dried she could not look on the sweet heaven either at morn or eventide
lines <num> – <num> she is surrounded by stillness and there is little movement within the poem
the water is calm and there is only the growth of moss about a stone @-@ cast from the wall a sluice with blackened waters slept and o 'er it many round and small the clustered marish @-@ mosses crept
lines <num> – <num> mariana is trapped by her surroundings and the last stanza begins with her becoming sensitive to sound as she starts to mentally lose her place in reality the sparrow 's chirrup on the roof the slow clock ticking and the sound which to the wooing wind aloof the poplar made did all confound her sense lines <num> – <num> the poem ends with a description that even the sunlight is unable to do anything more than reveal dust in her home but most she loathed the hour when the thick @-@ moted sunbeam lay athwart the chambers and the day was sloping toward his western bower
in mariana tennyson instead emphasises auditory imagery that serves to emphasise her solitude
her hearing is sensitive and she is able to hear every sound which only reveals the silence of her surroundings
her solitude and loneliness causes her to be unable to recognise the beauty of her surroundings and the world to her is dreary
in contrast to tennyson 's other poems including the lady of shalott there is no movement within mariana
there is also a lack of a true ending within the poem unlike the later version mariana in the south which reworks the poem so there is a stronger conclusion that can be found within death
the character of mariana is connected to shakespeare 's measure for measure there is a direct quotation of shakespeare 's play in regards to a character of the same name
in shakespeare 's play mariana is rejected by the character angelo and lives alone as she pines over her love
tennyson 's version is set in lincolnshire not vienna as in the shakespeare play
this makes the characters completely english
additionally the scene within the poem does not have any of the original context but the two works are connected in imagery with the idea of a dull life and a dejected female named mariana
however tennyson is not the only one that uses the image john everett millais 's painting mariana is based on tennyson 's version of mariana and lines <num> through <num> of tennyson 's poem were used for the catalogue description of the painting
similarly millais 's version served as the inspiration for elizabeth gaskell 's novel mariana
tennyson 's mariana and gaskell 's main character ruth are sensitive to the sounds around them and are constantly looking out of their window in image that represents their imprisonment within their homes
the image of mariana used by tennyson and the later works are equally of a woman who is weary
the depictions of mariana by tennyson and in later works are not the same
the difference with millais 's depiction is not in the image of a forlorn woman or of a woman who is unwilling to live an independent life instead it is her sexualised depiction that is greater than found in tennyson
his version also removes the dreariness of tennyson 's and replaces it with a scene filled with vibrant colours
gaskell 's depiction is of ruth is similar to tennyson in her weariness and wanting to die
however she is a sexually independent figure when she rejects her lover who has returned
tennyson 's character on the other hand would likely have happily accepted her lover
while tennyson 's character cannot recognise beauty within nature gaskell 's character is able to turn to nature to gain spiritually in a manner similar to the romantic poems including tintern abbey by william wordsworth or this lime @-@ tree bower my prison by samuel taylor coleridge
there is also a connection with mariana 's condition and the condition within coleridge 's dejection an ode
however the narrator at the end of dejection is able to be roused into movement whereas mariana never reaches that point
furthermore mariana is unlike the romantic poems because the character is not one with nature or able to achieve transcendence through imagination
furthermore there is little outside of mariana that exists within the poem as mariana 's mood does not respond to changes in nature
in terms of tennyson 's other poems there is a strong connection between the character mariana and tennyson 's other female characters
both mariana and oriana have characters that experience a mental imprisonment which are revealed in the poetic refrains
however oriana is able to have control over her own story when she serves as narrator of it while mariana is denied control by tennyson 's use of a third @-@ person narrative structure
the difference is further compounded by oriana 's imprisonment coming from her own memories while mariana 's is the external results of her lover having not returned
the character fatima of fatima is connected to mariana simply because she is a reversal of mariana 's character fatima like mariana waits for her lover but suffers from an intense passion that causes her to lose control over her mind while also being able to experience the world around her
the character oenone of oenone is a combination of aspects from both mariana 's and fatima 's characters
in the revised version mariana in the south the second mariana is similar to the lady of shalott in that they both live in a world between fantasy and reality
in an early review in the <year> westminster review j
fox praises the depiction of women within the whole of poems chiefly lyrics and says that tennyson 's portraits are delicate his likenesses
perfect and they have life character and individuality
they are nicely assorted also to all the different gradations of emotion and passion which are expressed in common with the descriptions of them
there is an appropriate object for every shade of feeling from the light touch of passing admiration to the triumphant madness of soul and sense or the deep and everlasting anguish of survivorship
a review by a professor lyall in <year> argues as descriptive poetry and for that feature of realistic description so characteristic of tennyson 's muse mariana has perhaps not been surpassed even by him
harold nicolson in <year> view the dreariness of mariana and tennyson 's other early works as an aspect that makes the early works better his later works
in t
s
eliot 's <year> essays ancient and modern he praises tennyson 's ability to represent the visual tactile auditory and olfactory aspects of the scene
later in <year> christopher ricks argues that the poem is one of tennyson 's masterpieces in the art of the penultimate
elaine jordan argues in her <year> analysis of tennyson 's works that the poem 's depiction of self @-@ infolding
is a negation which involves the drawing @-@ in of forces in order perhaps to assert the self differently
mariana is the most powerful expression very early of such a moment though its assertiveness exists only as strong gloom in image and rhythm not as narrative possibility except in the desire for an end to it all preferred over patience
in <year> ruth glancy writes in the last stanza mariana 's grip on the present is loosening and tennyson 's mastery of sound and images is evident even in this early poem in his description of the house that echoes her utter desolation
anna barton in her <year> analysis declares mariana the most famous heroine of the <year> volume and that both the ballad of oriana and mariana are poems of greater substance that develop the poetic that tennyson begins to establish in his briefer songs
it is the eleventh and final track on their <year> album the joshua tree
the song was inspired by lead singer bono 's experiences in nicaragua and el salvador in july <year> following u2 's involvement on amnesty international 's a conspiracy of hope tour
he learned of the madres de plaza de mayo a group of women whose children had been disappeared by the argentine and chilean dictatorships
while in central america he met members of comadres a similar organization whose children had been disappeared by the government in el salvador
bono sympathized with the madres and comadres and wanted to pay tribute to their cause
the song was written on a spanish guitar and the melody lifted from a piece bono composed in ethiopia in <year> to help teach children basic forms of hygiene
the lyrics contain an implicit criticism of the reagan administration which backed two south american regimes that seized power during coup d 'états and which provided financial support for the military regime in el salvador
thematically it has been interpreted as an examination of failures and contradictions in us foreign policy
mothers of the disappeared was favourably received by critics who variously described it as powerful a moving tribute and containing stunning beauty and sadness
the song was played seven times on the <year> joshua tree tour and some recordings were considered for the ending sequence of the <year> film rattle and hum
it was revived for four concerts on the <year> popmart tour in south america and for two of them the madres joined the band onstage for the performance one of which was broadcast on television in chile
bono used the opportunity to ask general pinochet to reveal to the madres the locations of their children 's bodies
the song was played a further three times on the u2 <num> ° tour one performance was dedicated to fehmi tosun an ethnic kurd who was forcibly disappeared in turkey in <year>
bono re @-@ recorded the song a cappella in <year> for the album ¡ ni un paso atras
u2 briefly interrupted these sessions in june to join amnesty international 's a conspiracy of hope tour
following the first concert in san francisco lead singer bono met rené castro a chilean mural artist
castro had been tortured and held in a concentration camp for two years by the dictatorial chilean government because his artwork criticised the pinochet @-@ led regime that seized power in <year> during a coup d 'état
castro showed bono a wall painting in the mission district that depicted the ongoing plight in chile and argentina
he also learned of the madres de plaza de mayo a group of women whose children were forcibly disappeared by the argentine government
the madres children were students who had opposed the government during the dirty war and the coup d 'état that brought jorge rafael videla into power
the madres joined together to campaign for information regarding the locations of their children 's bodies and the circumstances of their deaths believing them to have been kidnapped tortured and murdered
inspired by the mural bono took an extended break from recording into july travelling to nicaragua and el salvador with his wife alison hewson to see firsthand the distress of peasants bullied by political conflicts and us military intervention
while there they worked with the central american mission partners camp a human rights and economic development organization
in el salvador they met members of the comité de madres monsignor romero comadres committee of the mothers monsignor romero an organization of women whose children were forcibly disappeared by the el salvadoran government during the salvadoran civil war because they opposed the military regime that was in power
at one point during the trip bono alison and a member of camp were shot at by government troops while on their way to deliver aid to a group of farmers
the shots were a warning and according to author john luerssen the incident made bono realize that they didn 't care for their intrusion and they could kill them if they felt compelled
in <year> bono recounted another experience he had in el salvador where he had seen a body thrown from a van into the road
he remarked people would just disappear
if you were part of the opposition you might find an suv with the windows blacked out parked outside your house
if that didn 't stop you occasionally they would come in and take you and murder you there would be no trial
bono understood the cause of the madres and comadres and wanted to pay tribute to it
his experiences in central america inspired the lyrics of mothers of the disappeared and another track from the joshua tree bullet the blue sky
mothers of the disappeared was created and mixed at guitarist the edge 's newly @-@ bought home melbeach which u2 used as a recording studio
bono wrote the song on his mother @-@ in @-@ law 's spanish guitar and drummer larry mullen jr
created a drum loop that was sampled by producer brian eno
the melody came from a song that bono wrote in ethiopia in <year> to teach children about basic methods of hygiene
producer daniel lanois was the principal mixer of the song
bono likening the studio itself to an instrument described lanois 's mix as a performance
at the conclusion of the lyrics sheet for the song in the liner notes of the joshua tree u2 listed addresses for several branches of amnesty international and proceeds from the song were donated to the organization
in <year> bono re @-@ recorded the song a cappella in english and spanish for the album ¡ ni un paso atras english not one step back along with a recitation of the william butler yeats poem mother of god
the album was created by the madres in commemoration of the disappearance of their children

the song begins with the sound of rain hitting a roof which fades in over the first fourteen seconds alongside the bass and a processed drum loop beat by mullen which reverberates in the background

at the fifty @-@ second mark the drums play a more regular beat and the edge 's guitar accompanied by eno 's synthesizer enters

eno used a piano as a percussive instrument and mixed the result with the drum loop through a pcm70 effects unit to create a sound that bassist adam clayton called eerie and foreign and scary
lanois stated that the processing of mullen 's beat which resulted in a drone @-@ like sound became the song 's backbone and personality
clayton described it as evocative of that sinister death squad darkness
colm o 'hare of hot press felt it was the key sonic element because it evokes an abstract sense of evil and dread
in december <year> bono stated that he had a love – hate relationship with america and that this influenced his work on the album
speaking of his encounter with comadres in el salvador and their impact on the song he said there 's no question in my mind of the reagan administration 's involvement in backing the regime that is committing these atrocities
i doubt if the people of america are even aware of this
it 's not my position to lecture them or tell them their place or to even open their eyes up to it in a very visual way but it is affecting me and it affects the words i write and the music we make
in <year> clayton noted we were looking at this america through a european lens at a time when britain was under margaret thatcher who was breaking the miners
so we were singing from the same hymn sheet as the clash but with our spotlight focused on injustice inside and outside america
he said mothers of the disappeared was not just a reflection on what had happened under the military government in chile but also at the us which had supported that government and described bono 's vocals as prehistoric saying it connects with something very primitive
greg garrett an english professor at baylor university saw the song as an effort to respond to growing interests in doing justice — and calling to attention american failures in that regard noting that the regimes in south america had been supported by the united states because of their anti @-@ communist positions even though their tactics were in opposition to the democratic values that america claims to champion around the world
lisa hand of the sunday independent noted the influence of america on the track remarking it does not confine itself simply to the music but also extends to some of the lyrics
however far from being a tribute to the star @-@ spangled banner the words highlight the political untruths and ambiguities which exist within the u

mothers of the disappeared and bullet the blue sky both take a hard look at the american involvement in south america
richard harrington of the washington post described the song as a simple lament of great beauty and sadness pleading for the realization that ideological battles about right and left obscure the more important issue of right and wrong
author david kootnikoff described it as a portrait of the american dream gone rancid
it was performed three more times on the leg twice to open the encore and once to conclude the main set
u2 revived the song seven months later on the third leg playing it in the encore at three of the final four concerts on the tour
the final two performances in tempe arizona on <num> and <num> december <year> were filmed for the <year> film rattle and hum
u2 sang the refrain el pueblo vencerá which means a people united will overcome in spanish at the conclusion of the song
bono noted that the madres use the phrase for motivation
the edge said we 're so close to a spanish speaking part of the world we felt that maybe people at the concert might pick up on this lyric
bono added that they had closed every concert since <year> with the song <num> and so they were looking to replace it with mothers of the disappeared from that point on
he explained if the people of arizona sing this and if it goes into the film and onto the record wherever we go in a way for the next few years that will be taken up again
it 'll be an interesting experiment

the footage was considered for the closing sequence of the film but the band eventually decided against including it
pride in the name of love was used as the final live song and all i want is you was chosen to play over the credits
following the seven performances on the joshua tree tour u2 did not perform mothers of the disappeared until <year> on the fourth leg of the popmart tour
it was played at three concerts in argentina and once in chile concluding all four shows
bono sang el pueblo vencerá at the end of each performance
the first rendition was on <num> february <year> in buenos aires where it was performed with the madres accompanying them on stage
the song was played by just bono and the edge and was set against footage of the madres on the video screen
at the conclusion of the song the band members faced the madres and applauded an act in which the rest of the audience joined
part of the performance was later included on the television documentary classic albums the joshua tree
the cost of the tickets was too high for many fans in south america so the band broadcast the <num> february concert in chile live on television
knowing that many people in the country would be watching they played mothers of the disappeared in place of wake up dead man
the stadium in which the concert was held had been used as a prison camp by pinochet 's regime following the coup d 'état
again it was performed solely by bono and the edge against footage of the madres and they invited the women to join them on stage a second time
the madres held up photographs of their children and spoke about them briefly during the performance an act which received a mixed reception from the audience
bono made a plea to pinochet asking him to tell these women where are the bones of their children
mothers of the disappeared was performed again on the fourth leg of the vertigo tour on <num> february <year> in santiago and <num> march in buenos aires
although it was rehearsed by the full band it was played only by bono and the edge in an arrangement similar to the one from the popmart tour
the edge performed the song on a charango that chilean president ricardo lagos had given to bono earlier that day
it was played at three concerts on the third leg of the u2 <num> ° tour in place of mlk
one performance in istanbul turkey was dedicated to fehmi tosun an ethnic kurd who was kidnapped in october <year> and subsequently disappeared
the abduction was witnessed by his wife and daughter no information regarding his disappearance has ever been released
steve morse of the boston globe called the song powerful and described the backing vocals as tender and choirlike
don mcleese of the chicago sun @-@ times described it as a hymn to human rights
adrian thrills of nme called it a simple plaintive lament of stunning beauty and sadness
nicholas jennings of maclean 's felt that it was the joshua tree 's most topical song
music journalist andrew mueller felt the track was a wilfully downbeat finale
in rolling stone steve pond said mothers of the disappeared is built around desolate images of loss but the setting is soothing and restorative — music of great sadness but also of unutterable compassion acceptance and calm
lennox samuels of the dallas morning news stated that there was an ineffable sadness in bono 's vocals and images where night hangs like a prisoner stretched over black and blue calling it a moving tribute to people around the world who had lost loved ones to warfare and conflict
he added w hat 's remarkable about the song is that despite the intrinsic pain it remains eerily cleansing
even in the midst of decay and excess and horror bono can find hope and absolution
in <year> bono described it as a beautiful end to the album saying that song means as much to me as any of the songs on that album it 's right up there for me and noting that it is a song i 'm very proud of to this day
barbara jaeger of the bergen record likened mothers of the disappeared to new year 's day and pride in the name of love stating that the band used all three to stir political consciousness and to urge social commitment
thirteen years later ryan jones in his review of u2 's <year> album all that you can 't leave behind for the same publication said the song peace on earth contained echoes of mothers of the disappeared in its lyrics and the tone of the instrumental prelude
in reviewing the group 's <year> album no line on the horizon mueller said the closing cedars of lebanon maintains this essentially optimistic group 's counter @-@ intuitive tradition of ending their albums with rueful comedowns likening it to mothers of the disappeared
mcleese believed that the song had its roots in the folklike purity of traditional irish music
according to luerssen the song is notorious in central and south america and it is often played as an act of defiance by the madres
art for amnesty cited the song and the effect it had in spreading amnesty international 's human rights message as one of the reasons why u2 were awarded the ambassador of conscience award by the organization in <year>
reflecting on the applause given to the madres during the popmart concert in buenos aires the u2 magazine propaganda called the result about the most moving thing i 've ever seen on a rock stage
it was one of those ideas that really could have gone either way but the obvious empathy of the audience towards these women made it an unforgettable moment
following the televised concert in chile bono said it was amazing and confounding to discover that on our most pop of tours some of the best shows were in political hotspots like santiago sarajevo tel aviv
anywhere music meant more than entertainment
he added to be able to address general pinochet from the stage on live television in chile and say give the dead back to the living
please general pinochet tell these women where the bones of their sons and daughters are
that was an extraordinary moment
certainly in my life and u2 's
when asked if the negative reaction from some of the audience had disappointed the band bono said it had not stating it 's proof to me that a rock n roll audience are not lemmings
if they don 't agree with you they will let you know — but that doesn 't mean they 're not fans
i was flattered that we weren 't just playing to people who agreed with us
u2 's performance was later credited with inspiring a protest in the chilean parliament against pinochet who was in the process of becoming a senator for life after relinquishing his position as head of the armed forces
the opposition party brought in the madres who again held pictures of their disappeared children and asked for information on the location of their bodies
mothers of the disappeared has been covered several times

portrayed by american actress diana muldaur pulaski replaced the character of commander beverly crusher for the second season after gates mcfadden 's contract was not renewed
pulaski first appeared in the second season opener the child and made her final appearance in shades of gray
before playing the role of pulaski on the next generation muldaur appeared in star trek the original series playing different characters in the episodes return to tomorrow and is there in truth no beauty she later worked with series creator gene roddenberry on a pilot for the series planet earth
mcfadden returned to replace muldaur in the third season reprising her role as dr
crusher for the remainder of the series
reviewers criticized pulaski 's approach as well as her inability to fit in with the crew
critics noted that her transporter phobia was reminiscent of dr
leonard mccoy from the original series as was her relationship with data pulaski 's interaction with data raised comparisons to that of mccoy and spock from the original series
episodes featuring pulaski in a leading role such as unnatural selection produced divided opinions among critics with some describing it as a key episode while others argued that it showed only the negative side of her role
beverly crusher from the show
executive producer rick berman opposed this decision
to allow for mcfadden 's return in the future roddenberry wrote crusher 's character out rather than killing her
mcfadden 's departure led to an opening for a new cast member
the producers contacted american actress diana muldaur unaware of her past involvement with roddenberry 's star trek and planet earth pilot
in the original series muldaur played the role of a doctor in two episodes as dr
ann mulhall in return to tomorrow and as dr
miranda jones in is there in truth no beauty muldaur also worked on the pilot for planet earth after getting to know roddenberry and his wife majel barrett through their annual star trek christmas parties
muldaur was not required to audition for the role of pulaski
instead she was given <num> vhs cassettes of the first season
she found it very exciting noting it got better and better and better as she watched it
christina pickles was also considered for the part of pulaski a decision berman described as very tough
muldaur finally agreed to play the role but asked roddenberry to change the name of the character to kate which became katherine
the character of katherine pulaski was modeled on doctor leonard mccoy from the original series
like mccoy pulaski feared transporters and disliked unemotional colleagues
the dynamic between mccoy and spock was revisited with the relationship between pulaski and lieutenant commander data
muldaur believed that roddenberry deliberately created the parallel between the two characters on the two shows
katherine pulaski debuted in the second season episode the child with whoopi goldberg making her first appearance of the series as guinan in the same episode
even though muldaur was a regular character on the next generation she was only listed in the opening credits as a special guest star
overall muldaur described her experience portraying pulaski as hard work
she expected to be cast for just one season but was unaware of who would succeed her after she left
following production of the second season muldaur left the series and joined the cast of l
a
law
she used footage of the episode unnatural selection to gain the part
gates mcfadden returned to continue her role as dr
crusher on the next generation for the remainder of the series
she was previously romantically involved with commander william riker 's father kyle riker mitchell ryan after she was part of a rescue team responding to a tholian attack on a federation starbase
she realised that a romantic relationship with riker would not work but they remained friends
directly prior to serving on the enterprise @-@ d she served on the uss repulse under captain taggart who was sorry to lose her
in elementary dear data she challenges lt
cmdr data to solve an original sherlock holmes mystery on the holodeck
he accepts her challenge which results in the creation of a self @-@ aware hologram of professor moriarty daniel davis
pulaski joins data and lieutenant geordi la forge levar burton but is captured by moriarty who also takes over manual control of the enterprise
moriarty demands that they find a way to enable him to leave the holodeck but is persuaded by captain jean @-@ luc picard patrick stewart to release control and be stored within the ship 's computer memory until a means can be found to grant his wish
years later moriarty is released from the computer and takes control of the ship 's computer again demanding his freedom
he is finally tricked into thinking that his wish was granted but remains trapped inside a computer simulation ship in a bottle
pulaski 's apprehension at using the transporter was evident in the schizoid man where dr
selar suzie plakson went with the away team instead of pulaski as it required her to beam over to a transport vessel
however the transporter would later save pulaski 's life in unnatural selection after she was infected with a disease from the planet gagarin iv that accelerated her aging process
she uses the transporters to remove the infection and is returned to health
she demonstrates her medical expertise on several occasions
in time squared pulaski discovers that the duplicate captain picard is out of sync in time and will slowly improve until he returns to the point at which he left
in the episode pen pals picard orders pulaski to wipe the memories of a young girl called sarjenka whom data had been corresponding with and helping in violation of the prime directive
whilst in samaritan snare she is summoned to starbase <num> to perform heart surgery on captain picard as she is the most experienced surgeon nearby
this is despite picard 's wish for her not to perform the surgery due to his concern with the image it might give to the crew
when the enterprise arrives at the lost colony of mariposa in up the long ladder the mariposans kidnap pulaski and commander william riker jonathan frakes and steal their dna to clone new members of their colony
although technologically advanced the mariposans lack genetic diversity
when pulaski and riker discover the clones they destroy them
picard helps resolve the dispute by suggesting the mariposans allow the bringloidi a preindustrial rural people whose colony was destroyed to migrate to their world
the mariposans however have relied on cloning for <num> years and no longer sexually reproduce
pulaski notes that with time they will become familiar with the practice once again and recommends that the mariposans form large group marriages with the bringloidi to create a healthy population
following data 's defeat at a game of strategema in peak performance pulaski and councillor deanna troi marina sirtis attempt to console him but it is left to captain picard to convince data that he is not malfunctioning
pulaski 's final appearance on the next generation was in the episode shades of gray
when commander riker falls ill to a dangerous virus during an away team mission pulaski drives out the virus with a device that stimulates his memory centre
after she discovers that negative memories are more effective in removing the virus she uses memories of fear and survival to save riker 's life
in the alternative future timeline portrayed in endgame the star trek voyager finale pulaski is said to have worked at the starfleet medical facility in san francisco
in peter david 's novel vendetta <year> pulaski is reassigned to the repulse under captain taggart following her departure from the enterprise
in star trek progress <year> a starfleet corps of engineers book by terri osborne pulaski is on board the uss progress when it visits drema iv as she wants to check up on the progress of sarjenka a young girl from the next generation episode pen pals
pulaski also appeared alongside wesley crusher and guinan in michael jan friedman 's all good things
<year> a novelisation of the the next generation series finale
erdmann and paula m
block called unnatural selection the key pulaski episode
science fiction writer keith decandido felt that she displays all of her worst traits in this episode including her stubbornness her intensity her constant interrupting of people her bitching out data though at least this time she apologizes to him when he expresses concern over her health and
transporter @-@ phobia because apparently she wasn 't enough like dr
mccoy yet
decandido described pulaski as annoying and noted that this feeling was mirrored on screen by captain picard
in science fiction television a history author m
keith booker observed that pulaski never quite meshed with the rest of the crew
the events of elementary dear data led film professor zoran samardžija to suggest that pulaski may have been inspired by the works of friedrich nietzsche
in sherlock holmes and philosophy the footprints of a gigantic mind <year> samardžija notes that pulaski 's argument that data lacks intuition is reminiscent of parts of nietzsche 's <year> work human all too human
the relationship between pulaski and data was further considered by rhonda v
wilcox in her article dating data miscegenation in star trek the next generation <year>
wilcox notes that pulaski frequently challenges data in terms of his machine nature expressing scorn for his supposed insensitivity
she compares data 's emotionless state to slavery due to the reference in the child to maya angelou 's <year> work i know why the caged bird sings
this miner is a grey bird with a black head orange @-@ yellow beak and feet a distinctive yellow patch behind the eye and white tips on the tail feathers
the tasmanian race has a more intense yellow panel in the wing and a broader white tip to the tail
males females and juveniles are similar in appearance though young birds are a brownish @-@ grey
as the common name suggests the noisy miner is a vocal species with a large range of songs calls scoldings and alarms and almost constant vocalizations particularly from young birds
one of four species in the genus manorina the noisy miner itself is divided into four subspecies
the separation of the tasmanian m
m
leachi is of long standing and the mainland birds were further split in <year>
found in a broad arc from far north queensland through new south wales and victoria to tasmania and southeastern south australia the noisy miner primarily inhabits dry open eucalypt forests that lack understory shrubs
these include forests dominated by spotted gum box and ironbark as well as in degraded woodland where the understory has been cleared such as recently burned areas farming and grazing areas roadside reserves and suburban parks and gardens with trees and grass but without dense shrubbery
the density of noisy miner populations has significantly increased in many locations across its range particularly human @-@ dominated habitats
the popularity of nectar @-@ producing garden plants such as the large @-@ flowered grevilleas was thought to play a role in its proliferation but studies now show that the noisy miner has benefited primarily from landscaping practices that create open areas dominated by eucalypts
noisy miners are gregarious and territorial they forage bathe roost breed and defend territory communally forming colonies that can contain several hundred birds
each bird has an activity space and birds with overlapping activity spaces form associations called coteries the most stable units within the colony
the birds also form temporary flocks called coalitions for specific activities such as mobbing a predator
group cohesion is facilitated not only by vocalizations but also through ritualised displays which have been categorised as flight displays postural displays and facial displays
the noisy miner is a notably aggressive bird and chasing pecking fighting scolding and mobbing occur throughout the day targeted at both intruders and colony members
foraging in the canopy of trees and on trunks and branches and on the ground the noisy miner mainly eats nectar fruit and insects
most time is spent gleaning the foliage of eucalypts and it can meet most of its nutritional needs from manna honeydew and lerp gathered from the foliage
the noisy miner does not use a stereotyped courtship display but copulation is a frenzied communal event
it breeds all year long building a deep cup @-@ shaped nest and laying two to four eggs
incubation is by the female only although up to twenty male helpers take care of the nestlings and fledglings
noisy miners have a range of strategies to increase their breeding success including multiple broods and group mobbing of predators
the noisy miner 's population increase has been correlated with the reduction of avian diversity in human @-@ affected landscapes
its territoriality means that translocation is unlikely to be a solution to its overabundance and culling has been proposed although the noisy miner is currently a protected species across australia
early notes recorded its tendency to scare off prey as hunters were about to shoot
it was as the chattering bee @-@ eater that it was painted between <year> and <year> by thomas watling one of a group known collectively as the port jackson painter
john gould treated the name merops garrulus as the original description and renamed it myzantha garrula in his <year> work handbook to the birds of australia giving it the common name of garrulous honeyeater and noting the alternate name of chattering honeyeater
he noted the colonists of tasmania called it a miner and aboriginal people of new south wales called it cobaygin
que que gang was a local aboriginal name from the blue mountains
in the early <num> century australian ornithologists started using the name manorina melanocephala instead because it was listed first by latham in <year>
this usage did not follow the letter of the international code of zoological nomenclature and in <year> the international commission on zoological nomenclature conserved the current name by formally suppressing the name m
garrula
the species name melanocephala is derived from the ancient greek words melas black and kephale head referring to its black crown
other common names include mickey miner and soldierbird
four subspecies are recognised including subspecies leachi found in eastern tasmania
the mainland population was split into three subspecies in <year> by richard schodde — titaniota from cape york peninsula in queensland as far south as mareeba lepidota from central queensland and inland new south wales west of nyngan and the nominate subspecies melanocephala from southeastern new south wales victoria and southern south australia
there are broad zones where birds are intermediate between subspecies
further study is required to settle the taxonomic status of these populations
the noisy miner is one of four species in the genus manorina in the large family of honeyeaters known as meliphagidae the other three being the black @-@ eared miner m
melanotis the yellow @-@ throated miner m
flavigula and the bell miner m
melanophrys
one of the most obvious characteristics of the genus is a patch of bare yellow skin behind the eyes which gives them an odd cross @-@ eyed look
within the genus the noisy black @-@ eared and yellow @-@ throated miners form the subgenus myzantha
the noisy miner occasionally hybridizes with the yellow @-@ throated miner
molecular analysis has shown honeyeaters to be related to the pardalotidae pardalotes acanthizidae australian warblers scrubwrens thornbills etc
and the maluridae australian fairy @-@ wrens in a large meliphagoidea superfamily
<num> – <num>
<num> in in length with a wingspan of <num> – <num> centimetres <num> – <num> in and weighing <num> – <num> grams <num>
<num> – <num>
<num> oz
male female and juvenile birds all have similar plumage grey on the back and tail and on the breast and otherwise white underneath with white scalloping on the nape and hind @-@ neck and on the breast off @-@ white forehead and lores a black band over the crown bright orange @-@ yellow bill and a distinctive patch of yellow skin behind the eye a prominent white tip to the tail a narrow olive @-@ yellow panel in the folded wing and orange @-@ yellow legs and feet
a juvenile can be distinguished by softer plumage a brownish tinge to the black on its head and the grey on its back and a duller greyish @-@ yellow skin patch behind the eye
the noisy miner is similar in appearance to the yellow @-@ throated miner and the black @-@ eared miner it has a dull white forehead and a black crown while the others have grey heads
adults from central @-@ eastern and northern queensland tend to have little or no olive @-@ yellow edging to the feathers of the back and wings and have a wider white fringe on the feathers of the hind @-@ neck and back giving birds from queensland the appearance of having more distinctive scalloping than other populations
wing length generally increases with latitude and m
m
leachi has measurably shorter wings than the nominate race although no significant difference in wing length was found in a study of populations north of <num> ° s and south of the murray river
the subspecies leachi also has finer scalloping on the hind @-@ neck than the nominate race a more intense yellow tinge to the wing panels and a slightly broader off @-@ white tip to the tail
the far north queensland subspecies titaniota has a shorter tail paler crown larger yellow skin patch and paler upper parts without the yellow @-@ olive of the nominate race and lepidota found in western new south wales is smaller than the nominate race with a black crown and darker more mottled upperparts
previously known as the garrulous honeyeater it has a large and varied repertoire of songs calls scoldings and alarms
most are loud and penetrating and consist of harsh single notes
it has two broad @-@ frequency alarm calls that are used when mobbing intruders into their territory or when predators including humans are sighted and a narrow @-@ frequency alarm call that is primarily used when airborne predators are seen such as the brown falcon falco berigora or other large flying birds including the australian magpie cracticus tibicen and the pied currawong strepera graculina
the aerial predator alarm call is a series of high @-@ pitched slurred whistling notes
the broad @-@ frequency alarm calls are a series of churr notes low pitched and harsh occurring at low and high levels of intensity
the narrow @-@ band call is used in situations where the bird signals the presence of a predator and restricts information about its own location while the broad @-@ band alarm is used to attract attention and can initiate mobbing behaviour
these churring calls vary between individuals and laboratory tests show noisy miners can distinguish calls by different birds
hence this may be integral to the complex social structure of the species
contact or social facilitation calls are low @-@ pitched sounds that carry long distances
chip calls are given by individual birds when foraging and a similar call is given by nestlings that call at an increased rate as the mother approaches the nest
where there is a high level of social activity such as during territorial disputes with conspecifics calls are a series of quick regular single notes
the noisy miner has a mating display flight song a soft warble of low @-@ frequency notes given during short undulating flights by the male and responded to by the female with a low @-@ frequency whistle
the noisy miner is found in open woodland habitats where it is an advantage to call from the air so as to overcome sound attenuation
another display call described as yammer is a rapid rhythmical series of notes that is uttered during open @-@ bill wing @-@ waving displays
the noisy miner has a song described as the dawn song — a communal song of clear whistled notes emitted in chorus in the early hours of the morning from may through january
the dawn song which is also sung at dusk is audible over long distances and features duets that often involve antiphony
a nestling begins to give the chip call soon after it emerges from the egg and it calls frequently for the first two thirds of the nestling period and constantly for the last third
the call does not vary in the presence of an adult at the nest so it seems likely that the call is not directed at the adult bird
the nestling becomes silent when an adult gives an alarm call and makes a squealing sound when the adult delivers food
the begging call of a fledgling is similar to the call of the nestling but significantly louder and covering a greater frequency range which may make it more directional
the rate of calling on average is <num> to <num> calls in a minute and in open scrub the call can be heard up to a kilometre away
subsong a juvenile vocalization comprising elements of various calls begins to be uttered when the fledgling is around thirty days old
the noisy miner also produces non @-@ vocal sounds by clicking or snapping its bill usually during antagonistic encounters with other bird species or when mobbing a predator
its range in south australia has been steadily expanding since it was first recorded near adelaide in the early <num>
it is sedentary over its entire range
the noisy miner is territorial and the territory of a colony is aggressively defended — which has led to a significant reduction in avian diversity in areas occupied by the noisy miner with smaller species excluded
the noisy miner primarily inhabits dry open eucalypt forests without understory shrubs
it is commonly found in open sclerophyll forests including those on coastal dunes or granite outcrops forests dominated by spotted gum on mountain ridges and exposed slopes box and ironbark forests on the foothills of the great dividing range mixed forests of eucalypts and cypress callitris forests dominated by yapunya mulga gidgee brigalow or emu bush in stands of belah and scattered clumps of boree on the edges of woodlands of river red gum including swamp woodlands bordering floodplains and areas dominated by exotic species such as european ash and willow
it regularly inhabits degraded patches of forest where the understory has been cleared including recently burned areas and modified habitats such as lightly @-@ timbered farming and grazing areas roadside reserves bushland remnants in towns and cities and suburban parks and gardens with trees and grass but without dense shrubbery
the noisy miner has benefited from the thinning of woodland on rural properties heavy grazing that removes the understory fragmentation of woodland that increases the percentage of edge habitat and urban landscaping practices that increase open eucalypt environments
it has been described as a reverse keystone species as it is colonizing an ever @-@ increasing range of human @-@ dominated habitats and aggressively excluding smaller bird species from urban environments
this phenomenon has been also observed in rural areas
a field study across the south west slopes of new south wales showed that the noisy miner 's presence corresponded with reduced numbers of insectivorous birds such as fantails whistlers the restless flycatcher myiagra inquieta and other honeyeater species and that this decrease was most marked in sites with better access to water and nutrients
while it has been hypothesized that the proliferation of large @-@ flowering grevillea cultivars has contributed to the abundance of noisy miners recent research has identified the proliferation of lightly treed open areas and the presence of eucalypt species as the most significant factors in the population increase
large @-@ flowered grevillea hybrids such as grevillea robyn gordon can benefit the noisy miner in that an abundance of resources is usually dominated by larger aggressive honeyeaters and a continuous nectar source could provide an advantage for the non @-@ migratory species
a field study in box @-@ ironbark country in central victoria found miner numbers were correlated with the occurrence of yellow gum eucalyptus leucoxylon which reliably produces flowers and nectar each year
the abundance of the noisy miner is primarily determined by habitat structure
while the range of the noisy miner has not significantly expanded the density of the population within that range has substantially increased
high densities of noisy miners are regularly recorded in forests with thick understory in southern queensland <num> kilometres <num> mi or more from the forest agricultural land edge
many of these sites have extensive road networks used for forest management and picnic areas and walking tracks for recreational use and it has been found that these cleared spaces play a role in the abundance of noisy miners in the forests
there is evidence to suggest that higher road densities correspond with higher noisy miner population levels
field work in victoria showed noisy miners infiltrated anywhere from <num> to <num> m <num> to <num> ft into remnant woodland from the edges with greater penetration occurring in less densely forested areas
this has implications for the size of woodland habitat needed to contain miner @-@ free areas — around <num> hectares <num> acres
revegetation projects restoring buloke woodland a species of she @-@ oak integral to the survival of the red @-@ tailed black cockatoo calyptorynchus banksii have been interplanted with a nurse species usually fast @-@ growing eucalypts
noisy miner populations were more likely in those buloke woodlands where eucalypts had been planted at densities of up to <num> per hectare <num>
<num> per acre
the presence of noisy miners was accompanied by a substantial difference in number and types of other birds found in the woodland
males with overlapping activity spaces form associations called coteries usually consisting of <num> to <num> birds
coteries are the most stable unit within the colony
the birds also form temporary flocks when engaged in the same activity
these flocks called coalitions usually comprise five to eight birds although coalitions of up to <num> birds can occur when mobbing a potential predator
membership of the coalition changes frequently as individuals leave the group as it passes beyond the boundary of their activity space or the activity ends or changes as when the breeding season begins
females use activity spaces that overlap with those of male birds but not other females so that females will join coalitions with males in their area but only rarely will there be more than one female in the coalition
the exclusivity of female activity spaces leads to young females being driven out of the colony in which they were born and also makes it difficult for them to gain a place in a new colony
a study of banded nestlings that survived in one colony until the next breeding season found that they were all male birds suggesting that all female nestlings had died or left the colony
emigration of males does not seem to occur until the population density of the colony reaches a critical level
looking after the young is communal with males of the coterie bringing food to the nestlings and removing faecal sacs
communal feeding increases after fledging when males from nearby coteries may even bring food to the young birds if not driven off
roosting is usually communal with two to six adults and juveniles roosting in contact with each other usually near the end of a hanging branch up to <num> metres <num> ft above ground within their activity space
they select a new site each evening often selecting and rejecting several sites and engaging in aggressive calling and chasing as other birds attempt to join the group
they are often the last birds to roost at night but appear to sleep soundly undisturbed by torchlight
noisy miners drink together at the edge of lakes and dams and from cattle troughs often perching on a submerged branch
they bathe by diving head first into water and when almost totally submerged flapping their wings vigorously and ducking their heads under the water
they shake excess water off and then fly to a nearby branch to preen
they have been observed using rain- or dew @-@ soaked foliage to bathe and in dry weather will dust @-@ bathe in dry soil or fine litter such as grass clippings
bathing is communal with birds stimulated to participate by observing others
they are occasionally observed anting
roosting foraging preening bathing and dust @-@ bathing or anting are communal activities
dawn song is a communal chorus particularly during the breeding season
the communal interaction is facilitated by ritualised displays that have been categorised as flight displays postural displays and facial displays
in long flight displays initiated by either male or female birds groups of up to twenty birds from more than one coterie fly about <num> metres <num> ft above the canopy for distances of up to <num>
<num> kilometres <num>
<num> mi from the colony constantly calling and not returning to the colony for about twenty minutes
as they return the remaining birds show signs of agitation and sometimes fly up to join them
the short flight display is performed by the male and may be analogous to the territorial advertising displays of other birds
in a ritualised movement the noisy miner flies out from a perch across an open area in a rhythmic undulating pattern usually calling in flight
at the end of the clearing it turns on an upward swoop and flies silently back to a perch near the starting point
the head @-@ up flight is performed by the female during the nesting period and may function to attract male helpers
in its most intense form the body and tail are held almost vertically with legs dangling and the head held up and back
it is performed by the female when she is selecting the nest site and when carrying nest @-@ building material and probably has the function of indicating the location of the nest to other group members
postural displays include tall and low poses pointing open bill and wing waving
the tall posture is used when in close contact with another bird and is a mild threat
the bird holds itself upright with neck and legs stretched and it faces the other bird
the low posture is a submissive gesture the bird sits low on the perch with legs obscured by fluffed feathers and often faces away from the other bird
fledglings threatened by adult birds will adopt a low posture and open their bill widely
pointing is a threat display where the bird stretches out horizontally with feathers sleeked and the bill pointed at the target of the aggression
a bill snap will sometimes accompany pointing
an open bill display is used by subordinates in encounters between two birds and by a female on the nest when other birds approach
the trident bill display involves a fully open bill with the tongue raised and protruding and is a higher @-@ intensity submissive display
wing waving is often performed at the same time as an open bill display
the wings are flexed and held slightly away from the body and flapped out and up around three to six times
wing waving may be accompanied by a yammer call
eagle displays involve holding the wings and tail spread out in either a vertical or horizontal position
eye displays are made by exposing or covering the bare yellow patch behind the eye — when the feathers are completely sleeked the entire patch is visible and when they are fluffed the patch is hidden
eye displays are used in conjunction with postural displays with the yellow patch fully displayed by dominant birds using threat postures and immature birds tending to reduce the size of the eye patch when under attack from other members of the coterie
on occasion early in the breeding season mass displays erupt where twenty or thirty birds perform the various wing @-@ spreading displays short flights and constant calling
displaying birds are attacked by others and groups of silent but agitated birds watch the interactions
mass displays are more common in the early morning can last for up to <num> minutes and seem to be a combination of sexual and agonistic behaviour
a corroboree from the word for a ceremonial meeting of aboriginal australians is a group display where birds converge on adjacent branches and simultaneously pose hunchbacked giving wing @-@ waving and open @-@ bill displays and the yammer call
a corroboree occurs when birds meet after a change in the social environment such as a bird returning after an absence or the repulsion of an intruder or the coming together of different coteries
the corroboree appears to have a bonding function and may involve all members of a colony
much of the activity within a noisy miner colony is antagonistic with chasing pecking fighting scolding and mobbing occurring frequently throughout the day
the birds unite to attack predators and to defend the colony area against all other species of birds the species is also highly aggressive intraspecifically
female noisy miners are aggressive towards each other and one cause of a male @-@ biased sex @-@ ratio in colonies may be the females greater intolerance for each other driving immatures out of the colony and preventing the immigration of new females
aggression at the nest is common between males
adult males begin attacking juveniles when they are around <num> weeks old and attackers can include males that previously cared for the fledgling
adult females are less aggressive towards young birds although mothers do occasionally attack their own offspring and infanticide has been recorded
there is little male to female aggression other than the driving flights that form part of the mating ritual
in direct attacks of young birds pecks are directed at the eye patch
agonistic behaviour has been observed among nestlings with aggression intensifying after fledging and at times resulting in the death of a sibling
the noisy miner colony unites to mob inter @-@ specific intruders and predators
the noisy miner will approach the threat closely and point expose eye patches and often bill @-@ snap
five to fifteen birds will fly around the intruder some birds diving at it and either pulling away or striking the intruder
the mobbing continues until the intruder remains still as with a tawny frogmouth podargus strigoides or it leaves the area
mobbing of snakes and goannas is particularly intense and most species of bird even non @-@ predators entering the territory are immediately chased
the noisy miner has been recorded attacking an australian owlet @-@ nightjar aegotheles cristatus during the day grebes herons ducks and cormorants on lakes at the edge of territories crested pigeons ocyphaps lophotes pardalotes and rosellas
non @-@ predatory mammals such as bats cattle sheep and wallabies are also attacked though less vigorously than birds
noisy miner attacks are not limited to chasing the intruder and aggressive incidents often result in the death of the trespasser
reports include those of two noisy miners repeatedly pecking a house sparrow passer domesticus at the base of its skull and killing it in six minutes one noisy miner grasping a striated pardalote pardalotus striatus by the wing while another pecked it on the head until it died and a sacred kingfisher todiramphus sanctus being chased and harassed for over five hours and then found dead with a fractured skull
the most common initial response to alarm calls is to stay in the area and scan for threats rather than withdraw
a study conducted in melbourne and a nearby rural area found that noisy miners in urban areas were less likely to take flight and when they did they flew shorter distances
it is unclear whether this is an adaptation or bolder miners had been the ones to settle in the city
a field study in canberra found that superb fairywrens malurus cyaneus that lived in areas frequented by noisy miners recognised miner alarm calls and took flight and had learnt to ignore their non @-@ alarm calls while those that live in areas not frequented by noisy miners did not respond to miner alarm calls
this suggests the species has adapted and learnt to discriminate and respond to another species vocalisations
it is both arboreal and terrestrial feeding in the canopy of trees and on trunks and branches and on the ground
it forages within the colony 's territory throughout the year usually in groups of five to eight birds although hundreds may gather at a stand of flowering trees such as banksia
the noisy miner collects nectar directly from flowers hanging upside down or straddling thin branches acrobatically to access the nectar it takes fruit from trees or fallen on the ground gleans or hawks for invertebrates and picks through leaf litter for insects
it has been recorded turning over the dried droppings of emu dromaius novaehollandiae and eastern grey kangaroo macropus giganteus searching for insects
in a study of birds foraging in suburban gardens the noisy miner was seen to spend more time in banksia grevillea and eucalypt species and when in flower callistemon than in other plants including exotics
most time was spent gleaning the foliage of eucalypts and noisy miners were significantly more abundant in sites where eucalypts were present
the noisy miner can meet most of its nutritional needs from manna honeydew and lerp gathered from the foliage of eucalypts
lower numbers of noisy miner were recorded at banksias and grevilleas than other large honeyeaters such as little wattlebird anthochaera chrysoptera and red wattlebird anthochaera carunculata
detailed studies of the diet of the noisy miner record it eating a range of foods including spiders insects leaf beetles ladybirds stink bugs ants moth and butterfly larvae nectar from jacaranda mimosifolia erythrina variegata lagunaria patersonia callistemon salignus callistemon viminalis eucalypts argyle apple sugar gum yellow gum grey ironbark and grey gum banksia ericifolia b
integrifolia b
serrata grevillea aspleniifolia g
banksii g
hookeriana g
juniperina g
rosmarinifolia and flowering quince seeds from oats wheat and pepper tree fruit from saltbush mistletoe and crabapple frogs and skinks and other matter such as bread pieces of meat and cheese and food scraps
in the first study to demonstrate different learning techniques in a single species the noisy miner was found to employ different cognitive strategies depending upon the resource it was foraging
when searching for nectar which does not move but is readily depleted the noisy miner uses a spatial memory @-@ based strategy identifying characteristics of the environment — a strategy that is efficient in new environments and is not affected by changes in the bird 's activities
when searching for invertebrates it appears to employ a different strategy based on learned rules of insect movement they improve at finding invertebrates with practice
the two different strategies imply the existence of adapted cognitive mechanisms capable of responding appropriately to different foraging contexts
<num> – <num>
<num> ft away and if she moves away he pursues her aggressively
the female may perform a bowed @-@ wing display where the wings and tail are spread and quivered with the wings arched and the head pointing down
the male may adopt a vertical or horizontal eagle display with wings and tail spread wide and held still for several seconds
copulation is frequent and conspicuous with both males and females copulating with several birds while other members of the colony display or otherwise interfere with the mating pair
copulation usually occurs on larger exposed branches close to the nest site and can occur at any time of the day although slightly more often between <num> <num> and <num> <num> when communal activities are less frequent
the frenzied courtship activity had led to speculation that the female mates promiscuously to recruit males to help care for the young but recent genetic testing shows that <num>
<num> of noisy miner broods result from monogamous mating and that multiple paternity is rare
an observation of banded birds noted that while females copulated repeatedly it was always with the same male
mate switching between broods is uncommon with pairs staying together over several years
the noisy miner breeds all year long with most activity from july through november though the peak period is subject to seasonal variations with sharp peaks in laying activity when conditions are particularly favourable for raising young
the nest is built in prickly or leafy trees and the noisy miner is often recorded nesting in eucalypts and also in wattles araucaria banksia bursaria hibiscus mistletoe melaleuca pittosporum schinus and jacaranda
it seems to prefer moderately dense foliage for nesting often near the end of drooping horizontal branches
support for the nest may be the primary criterion of a suitable nest site rather than characteristics of the vegetation or location
the female alone builds the nest which is deep and cup @-@ shaped woven of twigs and grasses with other plant material animal hair and spider webs
occasionally the nest will include man @-@ made materials such as twine scraps of material and tissue paper
it is lined with wool hair feathers flowers or plant down and padded with a circular mat woven from fibres pulled from the cocoons of the processional caterpillar
the female noisy miner walks around on the ground close to the nest site picking up material
she gathers material from disused nests of other birds or dismantles its most recent nest to build a new one
the female completes the nest in five or six days
on average nests have an external diameter of <num> – <num>
<num> centimetres <num>
<num> – <num>
<num> in and an external depth of <num> – <num>
<num> centimetres <num>
<num> – <num>
<num> in
the internal depth of the nest is around <num>
<num> centimetres <num>
<num> in
eggs vary greatly in size shape and markings but are generally elongated ovals white to cream or pinkish or buff coloured freckled spotted or blotched with reddish brown to chestnut or a purplish red sometimes with underlying markings of violet or purplish grey
the clutch consists of two to four eggs
incubation is by the female only and the incubation period is around sixteen days
hatching is asynchronous with up to six days being recorded between the hatching of the first and last chicks in a clutch
young are naked at hatching and develop a cover of down within two to three days
the fledging period is around sixteen days and young begin to find food for themselves between twenty @-@ six and thirty days after fledging but are still regularly fed by adults to thirty @-@ five days
the young leave the nest before they are fully fledged and only able to fly downwards and scramble up
they do not go far from the nest return to it at night and take some weeks to completely leave the nest
many fledglings are found on the ground and in low shrubs during this period where they continue to be cared for until they can make their way up into the trees
these birds are often mistakenly rescued
the fledglings seek out siblings if separated and huddle together for up to three weeks after fledging
the noisy miner has some of the largest group sizes of any communally breeding bird with up to twenty males and one female attending a single brood
only males help with a nest and while many birds may be associated with a particular brood some males devote all their time to a single nest while others spread their helping efforts across five or six nests
behavioural evidence and genetic testing indicate that helpers are male offspring of the breeding pair or full siblings of the male parent
males nearly always bring food to the nestling singly and if several arrive at once one will pass food to a nestling while the others wait
the female leaves the nest quickly when a male bird arrives and never takes food from one of the helpers
communal feeding of the young increases after fledging and the young beg for food with constant chip chip calls and gaping mouths
the female rarely feeds the young birds after they have fledged
noisy miners were seen to have a range of strategies to increase their breeding success including multiple broods laying eggs early in the season nesting low in the canopy and group mobbing of predators these measures did not guarantee against nest failure due to the diversity of potential predators in the noisy miner 's open woodland habitat
the strong correlation between the presence of noisy miners and the absence of avian diversity has been well documented
the role played by the noisy miner in the steep decline of many woodland birds its impact on endangered species with similar foraging requirements and the level of leaf damage leading to die @-@ back that accompanies the exclusion of insectivorous birds from remnant woodlands means that any strategy to restore avian diversity will need to take account of the management of noisy miner populations
some habitat restoration and revegetation projects have inadvertently increased the problem of the noisy miner by establishing the open eucalypt habit that they prefer
a focus of many regeneration projects has been the establishing of habitat corridors that connect patches of remnant forest and the use of eucalypts as fast @-@ growing nurse species
both practices have sound ecological value but allow the noisy miner to proliferate so conservation efforts are being modified by planting a shrubby understory with the eucalypts and avoiding the creation of narrow protrusions corners or clumps of trees in vegetation corridors
a field study conducted in the southern highlands found that noisy miners tended to avoid areas dominated by wattles species of which in the study area had bipinnate leaves
hence the authors proposed revegetation projects include at least <num> acacia species with bipinnate leaves if possible as well as shrubby understory plants
translocation of noisy miners is unlikely to be a solution to their overabundance in remnant habitats
in a victorian study where birds were banded and relocated colonies moved into the now unpopulated area but soon returned to their original territories
the translocated birds did not settle in a new territory
they were not assimilated into resident populations of miners but instead wandered up to <num>
<num> kilometres <num>
<num> mi from the release point moving through apparently suitable habitat occupied by other miners — at least for the first <num> days following translocation
two birds with radio tracking devices travelled <num> kilometres <num> mi back to their site of capture
although noisy miners are protected across australia and a permit is required to cull them culling has been proposed as the most humane and practical method of reducing their impact particularly where combined with rehabilitation of the habitat to suit a wider variety of bird life
an unsanctioned cull took place on private rural property over <year> and <year> which reportedly resulted in an increase in species diversity
they were the culmination of a major naval construction program designed to give italy a powerful fleet of ironclads
the two ships principe amedeo and palestro were the last italian ironclads to feature sailing rigs and wooden hulls
they were armed with a battery of six <num> @-@ inch <num> mm guns and were capable of a speed in excess of <num> knots <num> km h <num> mph
the ships had uneventful careers spending much of it in italy 's colonial empire
by the late <num> they were withdrawn from service and employed in secondary roles first as headquarters ships for harbor defenses
principe amedeo was converted into a depot ship in <year> and was discarded in <year> while palestro was used as a training ship from <year> to <year> before being scrapped in <year> – <num>
the italian fleet had already acquired a pair of small french @-@ built armored frigates of the formidabile class and two more vessels of the re d 'italia class had been ordered from the united states
five more ironclads were ordered from foreign shipyards three wooden steam frigates already under construction were converted into armored ships and four more ironclads were ordered from italian shipyards
the two principe amedeo @-@ class ships were the last two of this first generation of italian ironclads
the design for principe amedeo was prepared by inspector engineer giuseppe de luca

both ships also carried an <num> in <num> mm gun that was mounted forward as a bow chaser
later in her career principe amedeo received a secondary battery of six <num>

they were completed too late to take part in the final stages of the wars of italian unification
instead they were assigned to the italian colonial empire with occasional stints in the main italian fleet
in <year> palestro took part in a naval demonstration off ragusa in an attempt to force the ottoman empire to comply with the terms of the treaty of berlin and turn over the town of ulcinj to montenegro
the following year principe amedeo was involved in a collision with the ironclad roma during a hurricane though neither ship was damaged
in the late <num> both ships were withdrawn from frontline service and employed as headquarters ships for the defense of taranto — principe amedeo — and la maddalena — palestro
principe amedeo was stricken from the naval register in <year> and used as an ammunition depot ship in taranto until <year> when she was sold for scrap
palestro was employed as a training ship between <year> and <year> when she too was stricken from the register
she was broken up between <year> and <year>
nuclei from latin nucleus or nuculeus meaning kernel is a membrane @-@ enclosed organelle found in eukaryotic cells
eukaryotes usually have a single nucleus but a few cell types such as mammalian red blood cells have no nuclei and a few others have many
cell nuclei contain most of the cell 's genetic material organized as multiple long linear dna molecules in complex with a large variety of proteins such as histones to form chromosomes
the genes within these chromosomes are the cell 's nuclear genome and are structured in such a way to promote cell function
the nucleus maintains the integrity of genes and controls the activities of the cell by regulating gene expression — the nucleus is therefore the control center of the cell
the main structures making up the nucleus are the nuclear envelope a double membrane that encloses the entire organelle and isolates its contents from the cellular cytoplasm and the nuclear matrix which includes the nuclear lamina a network within the nucleus that adds mechanical support much like the cytoskeleton which supports the cell as a whole
because the nuclear membrane is impermeable to large molecules nuclear pores are required that regulate nuclear transport of molecules across the envelope
the pores cross both nuclear membranes providing a channel through which larger molecules must be actively transported by carrier proteins while allowing free movement of small molecules and ions
movement of large molecules such as proteins and rna through the pores is required for both gene expression and the maintenance of chromosomes
although the interior of the nucleus does not contain any membrane @-@ bound sub compartments its contents are not uniform and a number of sub @-@ nuclear bodies exist made up of unique proteins rna molecules and particular parts of the chromosomes
the best @-@ known of these is the nucleolus which is mainly involved in the assembly of ribosomes
after being produced in the nucleolus ribosomes are exported to the cytoplasm where they translate mrna
what is most likely the oldest preserved drawing dates back to the early microscopist antonie van leeuwenhoek <year> – <year>
he observed a lumen the nucleus in the red blood cells of salmon
unlike mammalian red blood cells those of other vertebrates still contain nuclei
the nucleus was also described by franz bauer in <year> and in more detail in <year> by scottish botanist robert brown in a talk at the linnean society of london
brown was studying orchids under microscope when he observed an opaque area which he called the areola or nucleus in the cells of the flower 's outer layer
he did not suggest a potential function
in <year> matthias schleiden proposed that the nucleus plays a role in generating cells thus he introduced the name cytoblast cell builder
he believed that he had observed new cells assembling around cytoblasts
franz meyen was a strong opponent of this view having already described cells multiplying by division and believing that many cells would have no nuclei
the idea that cells can be generated de novo by the cytoblast or otherwise contradicted work by robert remak <year> and rudolf virchow <year> who decisively propagated the new paradigm that cells are generated solely by cells omnis cellula e cellula
the function of the nucleus remained unclear
between <year> and <year> oscar hertwig published several studies on the fertilization of sea urchin eggs showing that the nucleus of the sperm enters the oocyte and fuses with its nucleus
this was the first time it was suggested that an individual develops from a single nucleated cell
this was in contradiction to ernst haeckel 's theory that the complete phylogeny of a species would be repeated during embryonic development including generation of the first nucleated cell from a monerula a structureless mass of primordial mucus urschleim
therefore the necessity of the sperm nucleus for fertilization was discussed for quite some time
however hertwig confirmed his observation in other animal groups including amphibians and molluscs
eduard strasburger produced the same results for plants in <year>
this paved the way to assign the nucleus an important role in heredity
in <year> august weismann postulated the equivalence of the maternal and paternal germ cells for heredity
the function of the nucleus as carrier of genetic information became clear only later after mitosis was discovered and the mendelian rules were rediscovered at the beginning of the <num> century the chromosome theory of heredity was therefore developed
in mammalian cells the average diameter of the nucleus is approximately <num> micrometres µm which occupies about <num> of the total cell volume
the viscous liquid within it is called nucleoplasm and is similar in composition to the cytosol found outside the nucleus
it appears as a dense roughly spherical or irregular organelle
the nuclear envelope completely encloses the nucleus and separates the cell 's genetic material from the surrounding cytoplasm serving as a barrier to prevent macromolecules from diffusing freely between the nucleoplasm and the cytoplasm
the outer nuclear membrane is continuous with the membrane of the rough endoplasmic reticulum rer and is similarly studded with ribosomes
the space between the membranes is called the perinuclear space and is continuous with the rer lumen
nuclear pores which provide aqueous channels through the envelope are composed of multiple proteins collectively referred to as nucleoporins
the pores are about <num> million daltons in molecular weight and consist of around <num> in yeast to several hundred proteins in vertebrates
the pores are <num> nm in total diameter however the gap through which molecules freely diffuse is only about <num> nm wide due to the presence of regulatory systems within the center of the pore
this size selectively allows the passage of small water @-@ soluble molecules while preventing larger molecules such as nucleic acids and larger proteins from inappropriately entering or exiting the nucleus
these large molecules must be actively transported into the nucleus instead
the nucleus of a typical mammalian cell will have about <num> to <num> pores throughout its envelope each of which contains an eightfold @-@ symmetric ring @-@ shaped structure at a position where the inner and outer membranes fuse
attached to the ring is a structure called the nuclear basket that extends into the nucleoplasm and a series of filamentous extensions that reach into the cytoplasm
both structures serve to mediate binding to nuclear transport proteins
most proteins ribosomal subunits and some dnas are transported through the pore complexes in a process mediated by a family of transport factors known as karyopherins
those karyopherins that mediate movement into the nucleus are also called importins whereas those that mediate movement out of the nucleus are called exportins
most karyopherins interact directly with their cargo although some use adaptor proteins
steroid hormones such as cortisol and aldosterone as well as other small lipid @-@ soluble molecules involved in intercellular signaling can diffuse through the cell membrane and into the cytoplasm where they bind nuclear receptor proteins that are trafficked into the nucleus
there they serve as transcription factors when bound to their ligand in the absence of ligand many such receptors function as histone deacetylases that repress gene expression
both systems provide structural support for the nuclear envelope and anchoring sites for chromosomes and nuclear pores
the nuclear lamina is composed mostly of lamin proteins
like all proteins lamins are synthesized in the cytoplasm and later transported to the nucleus interior where they are assembled before being incorporated into the existing network of nuclear lamina
lamins found on the cytosolic face of the membrane such as emerin and nesprin bind to the cytoskeleton to provide structural support
lamins are also found inside the nucleoplasm where they form another regular structure known as the nucleoplasmic veil that is visible using fluorescence microscopy
the actual function of the veil is not clear although it is excluded from the nucleolus and is present during interphase
lamin structures that make up the veil such as lem3 bind chromatin and disrupting their structure inhibits transcription of protein @-@ coding genes
like the components of other intermediate filaments the lamin monomer contains an alpha @-@ helical domain used by two monomers to coil around each other forming a dimer structure called a coiled coil
two of these dimer structures then join side by side in an antiparallel arrangement to form a tetramer called a protofilament
eight of these protofilaments form a lateral arrangement that is twisted to form a ropelike filament
these filaments can be assembled or disassembled in a dynamic manner meaning that changes in the length of the filament depend on the competing rates of filament addition and removal
mutations in lamin genes leading to defects in filament assembly cause a group of rare genetic disorders known as laminopathies
the most notable laminopathy is the family of diseases known as progeria which causes the appearance of premature aging in its sufferers
the exact mechanism by which the associated biochemical changes give rise to the aged phenotype is not well understood
each human cell contains roughly two meters of dna
during most of the cell cycle these are organized in a dna @-@ protein complex known as chromatin and during cell division the chromatin can be seen to form the well @-@ defined chromosomes familiar from a karyotype
a small fraction of the cell 's genes are located instead in the mitochondria
there are two types of chromatin
euchromatin is the less compact dna form and contains genes that are frequently expressed by the cell
the other type heterochromatin is the more compact form and contains dna that is infrequently transcribed
this structure is further categorized into facultative heterochromatin consisting of genes that are organized as heterochromatin only in certain cell types or at certain stages of development and constitutive heterochromatin that consists of chromosome structural components such as telomeres and centromeres
during interphase the chromatin organizes itself into discrete individual patches called chromosome territories
active genes which are generally found in the euchromatic region of the chromosome tend to be located towards the chromosome 's territory boundary
antibodies to certain types of chromatin organization in particular nucleosomes have been associated with a number of autoimmune diseases such as systemic lupus erythematosus
these are known as anti @-@ nuclear antibodies ana and have also been observed in concert with multiple sclerosis as part of general immune system dysfunction
as in the case of progeria the role played by the antibodies in inducing the symptoms of autoimmune diseases is not obvious
it is not surrounded by a membrane and is sometimes called a suborganelle
it forms around tandem repeats of rdna dna coding for ribosomal rna rrna
these regions are called nucleolar organizer regions nor
the main roles of the nucleolus are to synthesize rrna and assemble ribosomes
the structural cohesion of the nucleolus depends on its activity as ribosomal assembly in the nucleolus results in the transient association of nucleolar components facilitating further ribosomal assembly and hence further association
this model is supported by observations that inactivation of rdna results in intermingling of nucleolar structures
in the first step of ribosome assembly a protein called rna polymerase i transcribes rdna which forms a large pre @-@ rrna precursor
this is cleaved into the subunits <num>
<num> <num> and <num> rrna
the transcription post @-@ transcriptional processing and assembly of rrna occurs in the nucleolus aided by small nucleolar rna snorna molecules some of which are derived from spliced introns from messenger rnas encoding genes related to ribosomal function
the assembled ribosomal subunits are the largest structures passed through the nuclear pores
when observed under the electron microscope the nucleolus can be seen to consist of three distinguishable regions the innermost fibrillar centers fcs surrounded by the dense fibrillar component dfc which in turn is bordered by the granular component gc
transcription of the rdna occurs either in the fc or at the fc @-@ dfc boundary and therefore when rdna transcription in the cell is increased more fcs are detected
most of the cleavage and modification of rrnas occurs in the dfc while the latter steps involving protein assembly onto the ribosomal subunits occur in the gc
these include cajal bodies gemini of coiled bodies polymorphic interphase karyosomal association pika promyelocytic leukaemia pml bodies paraspeckles and splicing speckles
although little is known about a number of these domains they are significant in that they show that the nucleoplasm is not a uniform mixture but rather contains organized functional subdomains
other subnuclear structures appear as part of abnormal disease processes
for example the presence of small intranuclear rods has been reported in some cases of nemaline myopathy
this condition typically results from mutations in actin and the rods themselves consist of mutant actin as well as other cytoskeletal proteins
<num> µm and <num>
<num> µm depending on the cell type and species
when seen under an electron microscope they resemble balls of tangled thread and are dense foci of distribution for the protein coilin
cbs are involved in a number of different roles relating to rna processing specifically small nucleolar rna snorna and small nuclear rna snrna maturation and histone mrna modification
similar to cajal bodies are gemini of cajal bodies or gems whose name is derived from the gemini constellation in reference to their close twin relationship with cbs
gems are similar in size and shape to cbs and in fact are virtually indistinguishable under the microscope
unlike cbs gems do not contain small nuclear ribonucleoproteins snrnps but do contain a protein called survival of motor neuron smn whose function relates to snrnp biogenesis
gems are believed to assist cbs in snrnp biogenesis though it has also been suggested from microscopy evidence that cbs and gems are different manifestations of the same structure
later ultrastructural studies have shown gems to be twins of cajal bodies with the difference being in the coilin component cajal bodies are smn positive and coilin positive and gems are smn positive and coilin negative
their function remains unclear though they were not thought to be associated with active dna replication transcription or rna processing
they have been found to often associate with discrete domains defined by dense localization of the transcription factor ptf which promotes transcription of small nuclear rna snrna
<num> – <num>
<num> µm
they are known by a number of other names including nuclear domain <num> <num> kremer bodies and pml oncogenic domains
pml bodies are named after one of their major components the promyelocytic leukemia protein pml
they are often seen in the nucleus in association with cajal bodies and cleavage bodies
pml bodies belong to the nuclear matrix an ill @-@ defined super @-@ structure of the nucleus proposed to anchor and regulate many nuclear functions including dna replication transcription or epigenetic silencing
the pml protein is the key organizer of these domains that recruits an ever @-@ growing number of proteins whose only common known feature to date is their ability to be sumoylated
yet pml- mice which have their pml gene deleted cannot assemble nuclear bodies develop normally and live well demonstrating that pml bodies are dispensable for most basic biological functions
at the fluorescence @-@ microscope level they appear as irregular punctate structures which vary in size and shape and when examined by electron microscopy they are seen as clusters of interchromatin granules
speckles are dynamic structures and both their protein and rna @-@ protein components can cycle continuously between speckles and other nuclear locations including active transcription sites
studies on the composition structure and behaviour of speckles have provided a model for understanding the functional compartmentalization of the nucleus and the organization of the gene @-@ expression machinery splicing snrnps and other splicing proteins necessary for pre @-@ mrna processing
because of a cell 's changing requirements the composition and location of these bodies changes according to mrna transcription and regulation via phosphorylation of specific proteins
the splicing speckles are also known as nuclear speckles nuclear specks splicing factor compartments sf compartments interchromatin granule clusters igcs b snurposomes
b snurposomes are found in the amphibian oocyte nuclei and in drosophila melanogaster embryos
b snurposomes appear alone or attached to the cajal bodies in the electron micrographs of the amphibian nuclei
igcs function as storage sites for the splicing factors
in <year> paraspeckles are irregularly shaped compartments in the nucleus interchromatin space
first documented in hela cells where there are generally <num> – <num> per nucleus paraspeckles are now known to also exist in all human primary cells transformed cell lines and tissue sections
their name is derived from their distribution in the nucleus the para is short for parallel and the speckles refers to the splicing speckles to which they are always in close proximity
paraspeckles are dynamic structures that are altered in response to changes in cellular metabolic activity
they are transcription dependent and in the absence of rna pol ii transcription the paraspeckle disappears and all of its associated protein components psp1 p54nrb psp2 cfi m <num> and psf form a crescent shaped perinucleolar cap in the nucleolus
this phenomenon is demonstrated during the cell cycle
in the cell cycle paraspeckles are present during interphase and during all of mitosis except for telophase
during telophase when the two daughter nuclei are formed there is no rna pol ii transcription so the protein components instead form a perinucleolar cap
they are located next to the transcriptionally active chromatin and are hypothesized to be the sites of active pre @-@ mrna processing
the main function of the cell nucleus is to control gene expression and mediate the replication of dna during the cell cycle
the nucleus is an organelle found in eukaryotic cells
inside its fully enclosed nuclear membrane it contains the majority of the cell 's genetic material
this material is organized as dna molecules along with a variety of proteins to form chromosomes
this is important for controlling processes on either side of the nuclear membrane
in most cases where a cytoplasmic process needs to be restricted a key participant is removed to the nucleus where it interacts with transcription factors to downregulate the production of certain enzymes in the pathway
this regulatory mechanism occurs in the case of glycolysis a cellular pathway for breaking down glucose to produce energy
hexokinase is an enzyme responsible for the first the step of glycolysis forming glucose @-@ <num> @-@ phosphate from glucose
at high concentrations of fructose @-@ <num> @-@ phosphate a molecule made later from glucose @-@ <num> @-@ phosphate a regulator protein removes hexokinase to the nucleus where it forms a transcriptional repressor complex with nuclear proteins to reduce the expression of genes involved in glycolysis
in order to control which genes are being transcribed the cell separates some transcription factor proteins responsible for regulating gene expression from physical access to the dna until they are activated by other signaling pathways
this prevents even low levels of inappropriate gene expression
for example in the case of nf @-@ κb @-@ controlled genes which are involved in most inflammatory responses transcription is induced in response to a signal pathway such as that initiated by the signaling molecule tnf @-@ α binds to a cell membrane receptor resulting in the recruitment of signalling proteins and eventually activating the transcription factor nf @-@ κb
a nuclear localisation signal on the nf @-@ κb protein allows it to be transported through the nuclear pore and into the nucleus where it stimulates the transcription of the target genes
the compartmentalization allows the cell to prevent translation of unspliced mrna
eukaryotic mrna contains introns that must be removed before being translated to produce functional proteins
the splicing is done inside the nucleus before the mrna can be accessed by ribosomes for translation
without the nucleus ribosomes would translate newly transcribed unprocessed mrna resulting in malformed and nonfunctional proteins
in the case of genes encoding proteins that rna produced from this process is messenger rna mrna which then needs to be translated by ribosomes to form a protein
as ribosomes are located outside the nucleus mrna produced needs to be exported
since the nucleus is the site of transcription it also contains a variety of proteins that either directly mediate transcription or are involved in regulating the process
these proteins include helicases which unwind the double @-@ stranded dna molecule to facilitate access to it rna polymerases which synthesize the growing rna molecule topoisomerases which change the amount of supercoiling in dna helping it wind and unwind as well as a large variety of transcription factors that regulate expression
they must undergo post @-@ transcriptional modification in the nucleus before being exported to the cytoplasm mrna that appears in the cytoplasm without these modifications is degraded rather than used for protein translation
the three main modifications are <num> capping <num> polyadenylation and rna splicing
while in the nucleus pre @-@ mrna is associated with a variety of proteins in complexes known as heterogeneous ribonucleoprotein particles hnrnps
addition of the <num> cap occurs co @-@ transcriptionally and is the first step in post @-@ transcriptional modification
the <num> poly @-@ adenine tail is only added after transcription is complete
rna splicing carried out by a complex called the spliceosome is the process by which introns or regions of dna that do not code for protein are removed from the pre @-@ mrna and the remaining exons connected to re @-@ form a single continuous molecule
this process normally occurs after <num> capping and <num> polyadenylation but can begin before synthesis is complete in transcripts with many exons
many pre @-@ mrnas including those encoding antibodies can be spliced in multiple ways to produce different mature mrnas that encode different protein sequences
this process is known as alternative splicing and allows production of a large variety of proteins from a limited amount of dna
although small molecules can enter the nucleus without regulation macromolecules such as rna and proteins require association karyopherins called importins to enter the nucleus and exportins to exit
cargo proteins that must be translocated from the cytoplasm to the nucleus contain short amino acid sequences known as nuclear localization signals which are bound by importins while those transported from the nucleus to the cytoplasm carry nuclear export signals bound by exportins
the ability of importins and exportins to transport their cargo is regulated by gtpases enzymes that hydrolyze the molecule guanosine triphosphate to release energy
the key gtpase in nuclear transport is ran which can bind either gtp or gdp guanosine diphosphate depending on whether it is located in the nucleus or the cytoplasm
whereas importins depend on rangtp to dissociate from their cargo exportins require rangtp in order to bind to their cargo
nuclear import depends on the importin binding its cargo in the cytoplasm and carrying it through the nuclear pore into the nucleus
inside the nucleus rangtp acts to separate the cargo from the importin allowing the importin to exit the nucleus and be reused
nuclear export is similar as the exportin binds the cargo inside the nucleus in a process facilitated by rangtp exits through the nuclear pore and separates from its cargo in the cytoplasm
specialized export proteins exist for translocation of mature mrna and trna to the cytoplasm after post @-@ transcriptional modification is complete
this quality @-@ control mechanism is important due to these molecules central role in protein translation
mis @-@ expression of a protein due to incomplete excision of exons or mis @-@ incorporation of amino acids could have negative consequences for the cell thus incompletely modified rna that reaches the cytoplasm is degraded rather than used in translation
during these events the structural components of the nucleus — the envelope and lamina — can be systematically degraded
in most cells the disassembly of the nuclear envelope marks the end of the prophase of mitosis
however this disassembly of the nucleus is not a universal feature of mitosis and does not occur in all cells
some unicellular eukaryotes e
g
yeasts undergo so @-@ called closed mitosis in which the nuclear envelope remains intact
in closed mitosis the daughter chromosomes migrate to opposite poles of the nucleus which then divides in two
the cells of higher eukaryotes however usually undergo open mitosis which is characterized by breakdown of the nuclear envelope
the daughter chromosomes then migrate to opposite poles of the mitotic spindle and new nuclei reassemble around them
at a certain point during the cell cycle in open mitosis the cell divides to form two cells
in order for this process to be possible each of the new daughter cells must have a full set of genes a process requiring replication of the chromosomes as well as segregation of the separate sets
this occurs by the replicated chromosomes the sister chromatids attaching to microtubules which in turn are attached to different centrosomes
the sister chromatids can then be pulled to separate locations in the cell
in many cells the centrosome is located in the cytoplasm outside the nucleus the microtubules would be unable to attach to the chromatids in the presence of the nuclear envelope
therefore the early stages in the cell cycle beginning in prophase and until around prometaphase the nuclear membrane is dismantled
likewise during the same period the nuclear lamina is also disassembled a process regulated by phosphorylation of the lamins by protein kinases such as the cdc2 protein kinase
towards the end of the cell cycle the nuclear membrane is reformed and around the same time the nuclear lamina are reassembled by dephosphorylating the lamins
however in dinoflagellates the nuclear envelope remains intact the centrosomes are located in the cytoplasm and the microtubules come in contact with chromosomes whose centromeric regions are incorporated into the nuclear envelope the so @-@ called closed mitosis with extranuclear spindle
in many other protists e
g
ciliates sporozoans and fungi the centrosomes are intranuclear and their nuclear envelope also does not disassemle during cell division
apoptosis is a controlled process in which the cell 's structural components are destroyed resulting in death of the cell
changes associated with apoptosis directly affect the nucleus and its contents for example in the condensation of chromatin and the disintegration of the nuclear envelope and lamina
the destruction of the lamin networks is controlled by specialized apoptotic proteases called caspases which cleave the lamin proteins and thus degrade the nucleus structural integrity
lamin cleavage is sometimes used as a laboratory indicator of caspase activity in assays for early apoptotic activity
cells that express mutant caspase @-@ resistant lamins are deficient in nuclear changes related to apoptosis suggesting that lamins play a role in initiating the events that lead to apoptotic degradation of the nucleus
inhibition of lamin assembly itself is an inducer of apoptosis
the nuclear envelope acts as a barrier that prevents both dna and rna viruses from entering the nucleus
some viruses require access to proteins inside the nucleus in order to replicate and or assemble
dna viruses such as herpesvirus replicate and assemble in the cell nucleus and exit by budding through the inner nuclear membrane
this process is accompanied by disassembly of the lamina on the nuclear face of the inner membrane
now there is a body of evidence that under pathological conditions e
g
lupus erythematosus igg can enter the nucleus
this can result from normal development as in the maturation of mammalian red blood cells or from faulty cell division
the best @-@ known anucleated cell is the mammalian red blood cell or erythrocyte which also lacks other organelles such as mitochondria and serves primarily as a transport vessel to ferry oxygen from the lungs to the body 's tissues
erythrocytes mature through erythropoiesis in the bone marrow where they lose their nuclei organelles and ribosomes
the nucleus is expelled during the process of differentiation from an erythroblast to a reticulocyte which is the immediate precursor of the mature erythrocyte
the presence of mutagens may induce the release of some immature micronucleated erythrocytes into the bloodstream
anucleated cells can also arise from flawed cell division in which one daughter lacks a nucleus and the other has two nuclei
in flowering plants this condition occurs in sieve tube elements
most acantharean species of protozoa and some fungi in mycorrhizae have naturally multinucleated cells
other examples include the intestinal parasites in the genus giardia which have two nuclei per cell
in humans skeletal muscle cells called myocytes and syncytium become multinucleated during development the resulting arrangement of nuclei near the periphery of the cells allows maximal intracellular space for myofibrils
multinucleated and binucleated cells can also be abnormal in humans for example cells arising from the fusion of monocytes and macrophages known as giant multinucleated cells sometimes accompany inflammation and are also implicated in tumor formation
a number of dinoflagelates are known to have two nuclei
unlike other multinucleated cells these nuclei contain two distinct lineages of dna one from the dinoflagelate and the other from a symbiotic diatom
curiously the mitochondrion and the plastid of the diatom remain functional
four major hypotheses have been proposed to explain the existence of the nucleus although none have yet earned widespread support
the first model known as the syntrophic model proposes that a symbiotic relationship between the archaea and bacteria created the nucleus @-@ containing eukaryotic cell
organisms of the archaea and bacteria domain have no cell nucleus
it is hypothesized that the symbiosis originated when ancient archaea similar to modern methanogenic archaea invaded and lived within bacteria similar to modern myxobacteria eventually forming the early nucleus
this theory is analogous to the accepted theory for the origin of eukaryotic mitochondria and chloroplasts which are thought to have developed from a similar endosymbiotic relationship between proto @-@ eukaryotes and aerobic bacteria
the archaeal origin of the nucleus is supported by observations that archaea and eukarya have similar genes for certain proteins including histones
observations that myxobacteria are motile can form multicellular complexes and possess kinases and g proteins similar to eukarya support a bacterial origin for the eukaryotic cell
a second model proposes that proto @-@ eukaryotic cells evolved from bacteria without an endosymbiotic stage
this model is based on the existence of modern planctomycetes bacteria that possess a nuclear structure with primitive pores and other compartmentalized membrane structures
a similar proposal states that a eukaryote @-@ like cell the chronocyte evolved first and phagocytosed archaea and bacteria to generate the nucleus and the eukaryotic cell
the most controversial model known as viral eukaryogenesis posits that the membrane @-@ bound nucleus along with other eukaryotic features originated from the infection of a prokaryote by a virus
the suggestion is based on similarities between eukaryotes and viruses such as linear dna strands mrna capping and tight binding to proteins analogizing histones to viral envelopes
one version of the proposal suggests that the nucleus evolved in concert with phagocytosis to form an early cellular predator
another variant proposes that eukaryotes originated from early archaea infected by poxviruses on the basis of observed similarity between the dna polymerases in modern poxviruses and eukaryotes
it has been suggested that the unresolved question of the evolution of sex could be related to the viral eukaryogenesis hypothesis
a more recent proposal the exomembrane hypothesis suggests that the nucleus instead originated from a single ancestral cell that evolved a second exterior cell membrane the interior membrane enclosing the original cell then became the nuclear membrane and evolved increasingly elaborate pore structures for passage of internally synthesized cellular components such as ribosomal subunits

its diameter is approximately <num> kilometers <num> miles making it the largest of the minor planets within the orbit of neptune
the thirty @-@ third @-@ largest known body in the solar system it is the only one identified orbiting entirely within the orbit of neptune that is a dwarf planet
composed of rock and ice ceres is estimated to comprise approximately one third of the mass of the entire asteroid belt
ceres is the only object in the asteroid belt known to be rounded by its own gravity
from earth the apparent magnitude of ceres ranges from <num>
<num> to <num>
<num> and hence even at its brightest it is too dim to be seen with the naked eye except under extremely dark skies
ceres was the first asteroid discovered by giuseppe piazzi at palermo on <num> january <year>
it was originally considered a planet but was reclassified as an asteroid in the <num> when many other objects in similar orbits were discovered
ceres appears to be differentiated into a rocky core and icy mantle and may have a remnant internal ocean of liquid water under the layer of ice
the surface is probably a mixture of water ice and various hydrated minerals such as carbonates and clay
in january <year> emissions of water vapor were detected from several regions of ceres
this was unexpected because large bodies in the asteroid belt do not typically emit vapor a hallmark of comets
the robotic nasa spacecraft dawn entered orbit around ceres on <num> march <year>
pictures with a resolution previously unattained were taken during imaging sessions starting in january <year> as dawn approached ceres showing a cratered surface
two distinct bright spots or high @-@ albedo features inside a crater different from the bright spots observed in earlier hubble images were seen in a <num> february <year> image leading to speculation about a possible cryovolcanic origin or outgassing
on <num> march <year> a nasa spokesperson said the spots are consistent with highly reflective materials containing ice or salts but that cryovolcanism is unlikely
on <num> may <year> nasa released a higher @-@ resolution image showing that instead of one or two spots there are actually several
on <num> december <year> nasa scientists reported that the bright spots on ceres may be related to a type of salt particularly a form of brine containing magnesium sulfate hexahydrite mgso4 · 6h2o the spots were also found to be associated with ammonia @-@ rich clays
in june <year> near @-@ infrared spectra of these bright areas were found to be consistent with a large amount of sodium carbonate na 2co <num> implying that recent geologic activity was probably involved in the creation of the bright spots
in october <year> nasa released a true color portrait of ceres made by dawn
kepler had already noticed the gap between mars and jupiter in <year>
bode based his idea on the titius – bode law — a now @-@ discredited hypothesis johann daniel titius first proposed in <year> — observing that there was a regular pattern in the semi @-@ major axes of the orbits of known planets marred only by the large gap between mars and jupiter
the pattern predicted that the missing planet ought to have an orbit with a semi @-@ major axis near <num>
<num> astronomical units au
william herschel 's discovery of uranus in <year> near the predicted distance for the next body beyond saturn increased faith in the law of titius and bode and in <year> a group headed by franz xaver von zach editor of the monatliche correspondenz sent requests to twenty @-@ four experienced astronomers dubbed the celestial police asking that they combine their efforts and begin a methodical search for the expected planet
although they did not discover ceres they later found several large asteroids
one of the astronomers selected for the search was giuseppe piazzi a catholic priest at the academy of palermo sicily
before receiving his invitation to join the group piazzi discovered ceres on <num> january <year>
he was searching for the <num> star of the catalogue of the zodiacal stars of mr la caille but found that it was preceded by another
instead of a star piazzi had found a moving star @-@ like object which he first thought was a comet
piazzi observed ceres a total of <num> times the final time on <num> february <year> when illness interrupted his observations
he announced his discovery on <num> january <year> in letters to only two fellow astronomers his compatriot barnaba oriani of milan and bode of berlin
he reported it as a comet but since its movement is so slow and rather uniform it has occurred to me several times that it might be something better than a comet
in april piazzi sent his complete observations to oriani bode and jérôme lalande in paris
the information was published in the september <year> issue of the monatliche correspondenz
by this time the apparent position of ceres had changed mostly due to earth 's orbital motion and was too close to the sun 's glare for other astronomers to confirm piazzi 's observations
toward the end of the year ceres should have been visible again but after such a long time it was difficult to predict its exact position
to recover ceres carl friedrich gauss then <num> years old developed an efficient method of orbit determination
in only a few weeks he predicted the path of ceres and sent his results to von zach
on <num> december <year> von zach and heinrich w
m
olbers found ceres near the predicted position and thus recovered it
the early observers were only able to calculate the size of ceres to within an order of magnitude
herschel underestimated its diameter as <num> km in <year> whereas in <year> johann hieronymus schröter overestimated it as <num> @,@ <num> km
ferdinandea however was not acceptable to other nations and was dropped
ceres was called hera for a short time in germany
in greece it is called demeter δήμητρα after the greek equivalent of the roman cerēs in english that name is used for the asteroid <num> demeter
the regular adjectival forms of the name are cererian and cererean derived from the latin genitive cereris but ceresian is occasionally seen for the goddess as in the sickle @-@ shaped ceresian lake as is the shorter form cerean
the old astronomical symbol of ceres is a sickle 〈 ⚳ 〉 similar to venus symbol 〈 ♀ 〉 but with a break in the circle
it has a variant 〈 〉 reversed under the influence of the initial letter c of ceres
these were later replaced with the generic asteroid symbol of a numbered disk 〈 <num> 〉
cerium a rare @-@ earth element discovered in <year> was named after ceres
in the same year another element was also initially named after ceres but when cerium was named its discoverer changed the name to palladium after the second asteroid <num> pallas
johann elert bode believed ceres to be the missing planet he had proposed to exist between mars and jupiter at a distance of <num> million km <num>
<num> au from the sun
ceres was assigned a planetary symbol and remained listed as a planet in astronomy books and tables along with <num> pallas <num> juno and <num> vesta for half a century
as other objects were discovered in the neighborhood of ceres it was realized that ceres represented the first of a new class of objects
in <year> with the discovery of <num> pallas william herschel coined the term asteroid star @-@ like for these bodies writing that they resemble small stars so much as hardly to be distinguished from them even by very good telescopes
as the first such body to be discovered ceres was given the designation <num> ceres under the modern system of minor @-@ planet designations
by the <num> the existence of a fundamental difference between asteroids such as ceres and the major planets was widely accepted though a precise definition of planet was never formulated
the <year> debate surrounding pluto and what constitutes a planet led to ceres being considered for reclassification as a planet
a proposal before the international astronomical union for the definition of a planet would have defined a planet as a celestial body that a has sufficient mass for its self @-@ gravity to overcome rigid @-@ body forces so that it assumes a hydrostatic equilibrium nearly round shape and b is in orbit around a star and is neither a star nor a satellite of a planet
had this resolution been adopted it would have made ceres the fifth planet in order from the sun
this never happened however and on <num> august <year> a modified definition was adopted carrying the additional requirement that a planet must have cleared the neighborhood around its orbit
by this definition ceres is not a planet because it does not dominate its orbit sharing it as it does with the thousands of other asteroids in the asteroid belt and constituting only about a third of the mass of the belt
bodies that met the first proposed definition but not the second such as ceres were instead classified as dwarf planets
ceres is the largest object in the asteroid belt
it is sometimes assumed that ceres has been reclassified as a dwarf planet and that it is therefore no longer considered an asteroid
for example a news update at space
com spoke of pallas the largest asteroid and ceres the dwarf planet formerly classified as an asteroid whereas an iau question @-@ and @-@ answer posting states ceres is or now we can say it was the largest asteroid though it then speaks of other asteroids crossing ceres path and otherwise implies that ceres is still considered an asteroid
the minor planet center notes that such bodies may have dual designations
the <year> iau decision that classified ceres as a dwarf planet never addressed whether it is or is not an asteroid
indeed the iau has never defined the word asteroid at all having preferred the term minor planet until <year> and preferring the terms small solar system body and dwarf planet after <year>
lang <year> comments the iau has added a new designation to ceres classifying it as a dwarf planet
by its definition eris haumea makemake and pluto as well as the largest asteroid <num> ceres are all dwarf planets and describes it elsewhere as the dwarf planet – asteroid <num> ceres
nasa continues to refer to ceres as an asteroid as do various academic textbooks

ceres was once thought to be a member of an asteroid family
the asteroids of this family share similar proper orbital elements which may indicate a common origin through an asteroid collision some time in the past
ceres was later found to have spectral properties different from other members of the family which is now called the gefion family after the next @-@ lowest @-@ numbered family member <num> gefion
ceres appears to be merely an interloper in the gefion family coincidentally having similar orbital elements but not a common origin
<num>
however a true resonance between the two would be unlikely due to their small masses relative to their large separations such relationships among asteroids are very rare
nevertheless ceres is able to capture other asteroids into temporary <num> <num> resonant orbital relationships making them temporary trojans for periods up to <num> million years or more fifty such objects have been identified
the most common transits are those of mercury which usually happen every few years most recently in <year> and <year>
the most recent transit of venus was in <year> and the next will be in <year> the corresponding dates are <year> and <year> for transits of earth and <num> and <num> for transits of mars
it has a small axial tilt of <num> °
this is nevertheless large enough for ceres 's polar regions to contain permanently shadowed craters that are expected to act as cold traps and accumulate water ice over time similar to the situation on the moon and mercury
about <num>
<num> of water molecules released from the surface are expected to end up in the traps hopping an average of <num> times before escaping or being trapped
<num> × <num> kg as determined from the dawn spacecraft
with this mass ceres comprises approximately a third of the estimated total <num>
<num> ± <num>
<num> × <num> kg mass of the asteroid belt which is in turn approximately <num> of the mass of the moon
ceres is massive enough to give it a nearly spherical equilibrium shape
among solar system bodies ceres is intermediate in size between the smaller vesta and the larger tethys
its surface area is approximately the same as the land area of india or argentina
some differences do exist
the ubiquitous features in ceres ir spectrum are those of hydrated materials which indicate the presence of significant amounts of water in its interior
other possible surface constituents include iron @-@ rich clay minerals cronstedtite and carbonate minerals dolomite and siderite which are common minerals in carbonaceous chondrite meteorites
the spectral features of carbonates and clay minerals are usually absent in the spectra of other c @-@ type asteroids
sometimes ceres is classified as a g @-@ type asteroid
ceres surface is relatively warm
the maximum temperature with the sun overhead was estimated from measurements to be <num> k approximately − <num> ° c − <num> ° f on <num> may <year>
ice is unstable at this temperature
material left behind by the sublimation of surface ice could explain the dark surface of ceres compared to the icy moons of the outer solar system
high @-@ resolution ultraviolet hubble space telescope images taken in <year> showed a dark spot on its surface which was nicknamed piazzi in honor of the discoverer of ceres
this was thought to be a crater
later near @-@ infrared images with a higher resolution taken over a whole rotation with the keck telescope using adaptive optics showed several bright and dark features moving with ceres rotation
two dark features had circular shapes and were presumed to be craters one of them was observed to have a bright central region whereas another was identified as the piazzi feature
visible @-@ light hubble space telescope images of a full rotation taken in <year> and <year> showed eleven recognizable surface features the natures of which were then undetermined
one of these features corresponds to the piazzi feature observed earlier
these last observations indicated that the north pole of ceres pointed in the direction of right ascension <num> h <num> min <num> ° declination <num> ° in the constellation draco resulting in an axial tilt of approximately <num> °
dawn later determined that the north polar axis actually points at right ascension <num> h <num> m <num>
<num> s <num>
<num> ° declination <num> ° <num> <num> about <num>
<num> degrees from delta draconis which means an axial tilt of <num> °
one crater with extremely low relief is <num> km <num> mi in diameter reminiscent of large flat craters on tethys and iapetus
an unexpectedly large number of cererian craters have central pits and many have central peaks
several bright spots have been observed by dawn the brightest spot spot <num> located in the middle of an <num> @-@ kilometer <num> mi crater called occator
from images taken of ceres on <num> may <year> the secondary bright spot was revealed to actually be a group of scattered bright areas possibly as many as ten
these bright features have an albedo of approximately <num> that are caused by a substance on the surface possibly ice or salts reflecting sunlight
a haze periodically appears above spot <num> the best known bright spot supporting the hypothesis that some sort of outgassing or sublimating ice formed the bright spots
in march <year> dawn found definitive evidence of water molecules on the surface of ceres at oxo crater
jpl states this water could be bound up in minerals or alternatively it could take the form of ice
on <num> december <year> nasa scientists reported that the bright spots on ceres may be related to a type of salt particularly a form of brine containing magnesium sulfate hexahydrite mgso4 · 6h2o the spots were also found to be associated with ammonia @-@ rich clays
another team thinks the salts are sodium carbonate
this <num> @-@ kilometer @-@ thick mantle <num> – <num> of ceres by mass <num> by volume contains up to <num> million cubic kilometers of water which would be more than the amount of fresh water on earth
this result is supported by the observations made by the keck telescope in <year> and by evolutionary modeling
also some characteristics of its surface and history such as its distance from the sun which weakened solar radiation enough to allow some fairly low @-@ freezing @-@ point components to be incorporated during its formation point to the presence of volatile materials in the interior of ceres
it has been suggested that a remnant layer of liquid water may have survived to the present under a layer of ice
measurements taken by dawn confirm that ceres is both differentiated and has a shape consistent with hydrostatic equilibrium which makes ceres the smallest object confirmed to be in hydrostatic equilibrium being <num> km smaller and less than half the mass of saturn 's moon rhea the next smallest such object
modeling has suggested ceres could have a small metallic core from partial differentiation of its rocky fraction
surface water ice is unstable at distances less than <num> au from the sun so it is expected to sublime if it is exposed directly to solar radiation
water ice can migrate from the deep layers of ceres to the surface but escapes in a very short time
as a result it is difficult to detect water vaporization
water escaping from polar regions of ceres was possibly observed in the early <num> but this has not been unambiguously demonstrated
it may be possible to detect escaping water from the surroundings of a fresh impact crater or from cracks in the subsurface layers of ceres
ultraviolet observations by the iue spacecraft detected statistically significant amounts of hydroxide ions near ceres north pole which is a product of water vapor dissociation by ultraviolet solar radiation
in early <year> using data from the herschel space observatory it was discovered that there are several localized not more than <num> km in diameter mid @-@ latitude sources of water vapor on ceres which each give off approximately <num> molecules or <num> kg of water per second
two potential source regions designated piazzi <num> ° e <num> ° n and region a <num> ° e <num> ° n have been visualized in the near infrared as dark areas region a also has a bright center by the w
m
keck observatory
possible mechanisms for the vapor release are sublimation from approximately <num>
<num> km2 of exposed surface ice or cryovolcanic eruptions resulting from radiogenic internal heat or from pressurization of a subsurface ocean due to growth of an overlying layer of ice
surface sublimation would be expected to be lower when ceres is farther from the sun in its orbit whereas internally powered emissions should not be affected by its orbital position
the limited data available are more consistent with cometary @-@ style sublimation
<num> billion years ago in the asteroid belt
although the majority of inner solar system protoplanets including all lunar- to mars @-@ sized bodies either merged with other protoplanets to form terrestrial planets or were ejected from the solar system by jupiter ceres is thought to have survived relatively intact
an alternative theory proposes that ceres formed in the kuiper belt and later migrated to the asteroid belt
the discovery of ammonia salts in occator crater supports an origin in the outer solar system
another possible protoplanet vesta is less than half the size of ceres it suffered a major impact after solidifying losing <num> of its mass
the geological evolution of ceres was dependent on the heat sources available during and after its formation friction from planetesimal accretion and decay of various radionuclides possibly including short @-@ lived isotopes such as the cosmogenic nuclide aluminium @-@ <num>
these are thought to have been sufficient to allow ceres to differentiate into a rocky core and icy mantle soon after its formation
this process may have caused resurfacing by water volcanism and tectonics erasing older geological features
due to its small size ceres would have cooled early in its existence causing all geological resurfacing processes to cease
any ice on the surface would have gradually sublimated leaving behind various hydrated minerals like clay minerals and carbonates
today ceres appears to be a geologically inactive body with a surface sculpted only by impacts
the presence of significant amounts of water ice in its composition raises the possibility that ceres has or had a layer of liquid water in its interior
this hypothetical layer is often called an ocean
if such a layer of liquid water exists it is hypothesized to be located between the rocky core and ice mantle like that of the theorized ocean on europa
the existence of an ocean is more likely if solutes i
e
salts ammonia sulfuric acid or other antifreeze compounds are dissolved in the water

this is generally regarded as too dim to be seen with the naked eye but under exceptional viewing conditions a very sharp @-@ sighted person may be able to see it
ceres was at its brightest <num>
<num> on <num> december <year>
the only other asteroids that can reach a similarly bright magnitude are <num> vesta and during rare oppositions near perihelion <num> pallas and <num> iris
at a conjunction ceres has a magnitude of around <num>
<num> which corresponds to the faintest objects visible with <num> × <num> binoculars
it can thus be seen with binoculars whenever it is above the horizon of a fully dark sky

<year> the nasa dawn spacecraft approached and orbited ceres sending detailed images and scientific data back to earth
named the asteroidal gravity optical and radar analysis agora this spacecraft was to launch some time in <year> – <year> and perform two flybys of large asteroids
the preferred target for this mission was vesta
agora would reach the asteroid belt either by a gravitational slingshot trajectory past mars or by means of a small ion engine
however the proposal was refused by esa
a joint nasa – esa asteroid mission was then drawn up for a multiple asteroid orbiter with solar electric propulsion maosep with one of the mission profiles including an orbit of vesta
nasa indicated they were not interested in an asteroid mission
instead esa set up a technological study of a spacecraft with an ion drive
other missions to the asteroid belt were proposed in the <num> by france germany italy and the united states but none were approved
exploration of ceres by fly @-@ by and impacting penetrator was the second main target of the second plan of the multiaimed soviet vesta mission developed in cooperation with european countries for realisation in <year> – <year> but canceled due to the soviet union disbanding
in the early <num> nasa initiated the discovery program which was intended to be a series of low @-@ cost scientific missions
in <year> the program 's study team recommended as a high priority a mission to explore the asteroid belt using a spacecraft with an ion engine
funding for this program remained problematic for several years but by <year> the dawn vehicle had passed its critical design review
it was launched on <num> september <year> as the space mission to make the first visits to both vesta and ceres
on <num> may <year> dawn acquired its first targeting image <num>
<num> million kilometers from vesta
after orbiting vesta for <num> months dawn used its ion engine to depart for ceres with gravitational capture occurring on <num> march <year> at a separation of <num> @,@ <num> km four months prior to the new horizons flyby of pluto
dawn 's mission profile calls for it to study ceres from a series of circular polar orbits at successively lower altitudes
it entered its first observational orbit rc3 around ceres at an altitude of <num> @,@ <num> km on <num> april <year> staying for only approximately one orbit fifteen days
the spacecraft will subsequently reduce its orbital distance to <num> @,@ <num> km for its second observational orbit survey for three weeks then down to <num> @,@ <num> km hamo for two months and then down to its final orbit at <num> km lamo for at least three months
the spacecraft instrumentation includes a framing camera a visual and infrared spectrometer and a gamma @-@ ray and neutron detector
these instruments will examine ceres shape and elemental composition
on <num> january <year> dawn took the first images of ceres at near @-@ hubble resolution revealing impact craters and a small high @-@ albedo spot on the surface near the same location as that observed previously
additional imaging sessions at increasingly better resolution took place on <num> january <num> <num> <num> and <num> february <num> march and <num> and <num> april
dawn 's arrival in a stable orbit around ceres was delayed after close to reaching ceres it was hit by a cosmic ray making it take another longer route around ceres in back instead of a direct spiral towards it
the chinese space agency is designing a sample retrieval mission from ceres that would take place during the <num>

the island 's peninsulas radiate from a mountainous centre dominated by the cuillins the rocky slopes of which provide some of the most dramatic mountain scenery in the country
although it has been suggested that the gaelic sgitheanach describes a winged shape there is no definitive agreement as to the name 's origins
the island has been occupied since the mesolithic period and its history includes a time of norse rule and a long period of domination by clan macleod and clan donald
the <num> @-@ century jacobite risings led to the breaking up of the clan system and subsequent clearances that replaced entire communities with sheep farms some of which also involved forced emigrations to distant lands

the abundant wildlife includes the golden eagle red deer and atlantic salmon
the local flora is dominated by heather moor and there are nationally important invertebrate populations on the surrounding sea bed
skye has provided the locations for various novels and feature films and is celebrated in poetry and song
one possible derivation comes from skitis an early celtic word for winged which may describe how the island 's peninsulas radiate out from a mountainous centre
subsequent gaelic- norse- and english @-@ speaking peoples have influenced the history of skye the relationships between their names for the island are not straightforward
various etymologies have been proposed such as the winged isle or the notched isle but no definitive solution has been found to date and the placename may be from an earlier non @-@ gaelic language
in the norse sagas skye is called skíð for example in the hákonar saga hákonarsonar and a skaldic poem in the heimskringla from c
<num> contains a line that translates as the hunger battle @-@ birds were filled in skye with blood of foemen killed
the island was also referred to by the norse as skuy misty isle skýey or skuyö isle of cloud
the traditional gaelic name is an t @-@ eilean sgitheanach the island of skye an t @-@ eilean sgiathanach being a more recent and less common spelling

its occupation is probably linked to that of the rock shelter at sand applecross on the mainland coast of wester ross where tools made of a mudstone from an corran have been found
surveys of the area between the two shores of the inner sound and sound of raasay have revealed <num> sites with potentially mesolithic deposits
finds of bloodstone microliths on the foreshore at orbost on the west coast of the island near dunvegan also suggest mesolithic occupation
these tools probably originate from the nearby island of rum
rubha an dùnain an uninhabited peninsula to the south of the cuillin has a variety of archaeological sites dating from the neolithic onwards
there is a <num> or <num> millennium bc chambered cairn an iron age promontory fort and the remains of other prehistoric settlement dating from the bronze age nearby

the irish annals record a number of events on skye in the later <num> and early <num> centuries – mainly concerning the struggles between rival dynasties that formed the background to the old irish language romance scéla cano meic gartnáin
the norse held sway throughout the hebrides from the <num> century until after the treaty of perth in <num>
however apart from placenames little remains of their presence on skye in the written or archaeological record
apart from the name skye itself all pre @-@ norse placenames seem to have been obliterated by the scandinavian settlers
viking heritage is claimed by clan macleod and norse tradition is celebrated in the winter fire festival at dunvegan during which a replica viking long boat is set alight
following the disintegration of the lordship of the isles the mackinnons also emerged as an independent clan whose substantial landholdings in skye were centred on strathaird
clan macneacail also have a long association with trotternish and in the <num> century many of the macinnes clan moved to sleat
the macdonalds of south uist were bitter rivals of the macleods and an attempt by the former to murder church @-@ goers at trumpan in retaliation for a previous massacre on eigg resulted in the battle of the spoiling dyke of <year>
after the failure of the jacobite rebellion of <year> flora macdonald became famous for rescuing prince charles edward stuart from the hanoverian troops
although she was born on south uist her story is strongly associated with their escape via skye and she is buried at kilmuir in trotternish
samuel johnson and james boswell 's visit to skye in <year> and their meeting with flora macdonald in kilmuir is recorded in boswell 's the journal of a tour to the hebrides
boswell wrote to see dr
samuel johnson the great champion of the english tories salute miss flora macdonald in the isle of sky sic was a striking sight for though somewhat congenial in their notions it was very improbable they should meet here
johnson 's words that flora macdonald was a name that will be mentioned in history and if courage and fidelity be virtues mentioned with honour are written on her gravestone
after this rebellion the clan system was broken up and skye became a series of landed estates
of the island in general johnson observed i never was in any house of the islands where i did not find books in more languages than one if i staid long enough to want them except one from which the family was removed
literature is not neglected by the higher rank of the hebrideans
it need not i suppose be mentioned that in countries so little frequented as the islands there are no houses where travellers are entertained for money
he that wanders about these wilds either procures recommendations to those whose habitations lie near his way or when night and weariness come upon him takes the chance of general hospitality
if he finds only a cottage he can expect little more than shelter for the cottagers have little more for themselves but if his good fortune brings him to the residence of a gentleman he will be glad of a storm to prolong his stay

during the <num> century the inhabitants of skye were also devastated by famine and clearances
thirty thousand people were evicted between <year> and <year> alone many of them forced to emigrate to the new world
for example the settlement of lorgill on the west coast of duirinish was cleared on <num> august <year>
every crofter under the age of seventy was removed and placed on board the midlothian on threat of imprisonment with those over that age being sent to the poorhouse
the battle of the braes involved a demonstration against a lack of access to land and the serving of eviction notices
the incident involved numerous crofters and about <num> police officers
this event was instrumental in the creation of the napier commission which reported in <year> on the situation in the highlands
disturbances continued until the passing of the <year> crofters act and on one occasion <num> marines were deployed on skye to maintain order
the ruins of cleared villages can still be seen at lorgill boreraig and suisnish in strath swordale and tusdale on minginish
from the <num> century until <year> skye was part of the county of inverness @-@ shire but the crofting economy languished and according to slesser generations of uk governments have treated the island people contemptuously

by <year> the population was less than a third of its peak recorded figure in <year>
however the number of residents then grew by over <num> per cent in the thirty years to <year>
the changing relationship between the residents and the land is evidenced by robert carruthers 's remark circa <year> that there is now a village in portree containing three hundred inhabitants
even if this estimate is inexact the population of the island 's largest settlement has probably increased sixfold or more since then
during the period the total number of island residents has declined by <num> per cent or more

very large corporations such as ge toyota and sharp and investment firms such as goldman sachs are making multibillion @-@ dollar investments in clean technology
emerging clean tech cities are seen to include copenhagen where wind power generates <num> percent of denmark 's electricity and chicago a leader in green buildings saving energy heating and cooling costs
statistics from the u
s
and from abroad especially from china india brazil and europe are presented
the authors say that nuclear power and clean coal are not clean technologies
apart from the risks associated with nuclear power multibillion @-@ dollar nuclear plants are simply not cost @-@ effective when compared with other energy sources
the authors also believe that clean coal is an oxymoron for a myriad of reasons including the sheer number of coal mine @-@ related deaths and the fact that coal @-@ fired plants even some cleaner ones are major contributors to serious illnesses such as asthma heart disease and mercury poisoning
pernick and wilder do not recommend specific stocks or securities
they prefer to lay out a blueprint of opportunities technologies companies and trends that may build successful businesses and strengthen economies
costs
perhaps the most powerful force driving today ’ s clean @-@ tech growth is simple economics
as a general trend clean @-@ energy costs are falling as the costs of fossil fuel energy are going up
the future of clean tech is going to be in many ways about scaling up manufacturing and driving down costs
capital
an unprecedented influx of capital is changing the clean tech landscape with billions of dollars euros yen and yuan pouring in from a myriad of public and private sector sources
competition
governments are competing aggressively in the highstakes race to dominate in the clean @-@ tech sector and build the jobs of the future
china
clean tech is being driven by the inexorable demands being placed on the earth not only by mature economies but also by the explosive demand for resources in china india and other developing nations
their expanding energy needs are driving major growth in clean @-@ energy transportation building and water @-@ delivery technologies
consumers
savvy consumers are demanding cleaner products and services that use resources efficiently reduce costs and embrace quality over quantity
climate
the debate around climate change has gone from question mark to peer @-@ reviewed certainty and smart businesses are taking heed
the six c ’ s are a simple list of factors not necessarily a useful framework for understanding or profiting from the clean technology industry
an e @-@ book version was published by harpercollins on june <num> <year>
in <year> a revised paperback edition was published with a new sub @-@ title discover the top trends technologies and companies to watch
the book has been translated into seven languages
paul gruber from the erb institute states that the the clean tech revolution is logically organized and is an excellent resource for those who would like a solid understanding of clean tech and the potential of each sector
he also says that it is very useful for those seeking out the names of companies ngos agencies and people working on each technology
gruber identifies one omission the concern that major investments in clean technology parallel those made during the internet boom with the attendant fear that there may be a bubble burst with clean tech
the physicist and environmentalist joseph romm has recommended the clean tech revolution to people who are looking for one book to help them understand what is happening in clean technology
he says the clean tech revolution is the only book that covers the whole gamut of the latest in clean energy
russ juskalian from usa today says the clean tech revolution shows the green movement not in heartstring terms but as economically profitable
the real power players are the mainstream consumers investors entrepreneurs governments and multinational corporations whose eyes are trained on that most crucial of economic fundamentals the bottom line
according to reena jana from business week the clean tech revolution is a readable straightforward guide to earth @-@ friendly business strategies
the authors explain how businesses can follow the lead of companies such as toyota by designing selling or funding inventive eco @-@ friendly products and services
jana says that the toyota prius is just one well @-@ known example of successful clean technology in action
denis du bois editor of energy priorities magazine commented on the realistic and comprehensive coverage of the book
however he suggests that the clean tech revolution is not an explanation of the technologies and how they work nor is it an analysis of energy or environmental policy
policy is complicated and the authors avoid discussing it in detail
little discussion ties the various clean technologies together and a single @-@ minded american focus dominates
there is very little on the influence of mass transit and urban planning in europe and other progressive regions
the chapter on water focuses on filtration which is already an area of considerable opportunity affecting even green industries such as photovoltaics manufacturing
francesca rheannon in sustainability investment news says that the book does not ask the most challenging question of all is clean growth an oxymoron she says that at a time when some experts say carbon emissions will need to be cut by <num> to <num> by <year> the world may have to accept steady or even decreasing energy production no matter how clean it is
rheannon also states that there is little coverage of social issues
for example nowhere is there mention of how water supply privatization and delivery by multinational corporations could affect the poor people of the world
the clean tech revolution was followed by the <year> book clean tech nation how the u
s
can lead in the new global economy
clint wilder is senior editor at clean edge and a veteran business and technology journalist
both authors have been mapping clean technology trends for many years and identifying business opportunities for prospective investors
rising in the rocky mountains of western montana the missouri flows east and south for <num> @,@ <num> miles <num> @,@ <num> km before entering the mississippi river north of st
louis missouri
the river takes drainage from a sparsely populated semi @-@ arid watershed of more than half a million square miles <num> @,@ <num> @,@ <num> km2 which includes parts of ten u
s
states and two canadian provinces
when combined with the lower mississippi river it forms the world 's fourth longest river system
for over <num> @,@ <num> years people have depended on the missouri river and its tributaries as a source of sustenance and transportation
more than ten major groups of native americans populated the watershed most leading a nomadic lifestyle and dependent on enormous buffalo herds that once roamed through the great plains
the first europeans encountered the river in the late seventeenth century and the region passed through spanish and french hands before finally becoming part of the united states through the louisiana purchase
the missouri was long believed to be part of the northwest passage – a water route from the atlantic to the pacific – but when lewis and clark became the first to travel the river 's entire length they confirmed the mythical pathway to be no more than a legend
the missouri river was one of the main routes for the westward expansion of the united states during the <num> century
the growth of the fur trade in the early <num> laid much of the groundwork as trappers explored the region and blazed trails
pioneers headed west en masse beginning in the <num> first by covered wagon then by the growing numbers of steamboats entering service on the river
former native american lands in the watershed were taken over by settlers leading to some of the most longstanding and violent wars against indigenous peoples in american history
during the <num> century the missouri river basin was extensively developed for irrigation flood control and the generation of hydroelectric power
fifteen dams impound the main stem of the river with hundreds more on tributaries
meanders have been cut and the river channelized to improve navigation reducing its length by almost <num> miles <num> km from pre @-@ development times
although the lower missouri valley is now a populous and highly productive agricultural and industrial region heavy development has taken its toll on wildlife and fish populations as well as water quality
the longest begins near brower 's spring <num> @,@ <num> feet <num> @,@ <num> m above sea level on the southeastern slopes of mount jefferson in the centennial mountains
flowing west then north it runs first in hell roaring creek then west into the red rock swings northeast to become the beaverhead it finally joins with the big hole to form the jefferson
the firehole river originates at madison lake in wyoming 's yellowstone national park and joins with the gibbon to form the madison while the gallatin river rises out of gallatin lake also in the national park
these two streams then flow north and northwest into montana
the missouri river officially starts at the confluence of the jefferson and madison in missouri headwaters state park near three forks montana and is joined by the gallatin a mile <num>
<num> km downstream
the missouri then passes through canyon ferry lake a reservoir west of the big belt mountains
issuing from the mountains near cascade the river flows northeast to the city of great falls where it drops over the great falls of the missouri a series of five substantial waterfalls
it then winds east through a scenic region of canyons and badlands known as the missouri breaks receiving the marias river from the west then widening into the fort peck lake reservoir a few miles above the confluence with the musselshell river
farther on the river passes through the fort peck dam and immediately downstream the milk river joins from the north
flowing eastwards through the plains of eastern montana the missouri receives the poplar river from the north before crossing into north dakota where the yellowstone river its greatest tributary by volume joins from the southwest
at the confluence the yellowstone is actually the larger river
the missouri then meanders east past williston and into lake sakakawea the reservoir formed by garrison dam
below the dam the missouri receives the knife river from the west and flows south to bismarck the capital of north dakota where the heart river joins from the west
it slows into the lake oahe reservoir just before the cannonball river confluence
while it continues south eventually reaching oahe dam in south dakota the grand moreau and cheyenne rivers all join the missouri from the west
the missouri makes a bend to the southeast as it winds through the great plains receiving the niobrara river and many smaller tributaries from the southwest
it then proceeds to form the boundary of south dakota and nebraska then after being joined by the james river from the north forms the iowa – nebraska boundary
at sioux city the big sioux river comes in from the north
the missouri flows south to the city of omaha where it receives its longest tributary the platte river from the west
downstream it begins to define the nebraska – missouri border then flows between missouri and kansas
the missouri swings east at kansas city where the kansas river enters from the west and so on into north @-@ central missouri
to the east of the kansas city missouri receives on the left side the grand river
it passes south of columbia and receives the osage and gasconade rivers from the south downstream of jefferson city
the river then rounds the northern side of st
louis to join the mississippi river on the border between missouri and illinois
comparable to the size of the canadian province of quebec the watershed encompasses most of the central great plains stretching from the rocky mountains in the west to the mississippi river valley in the east and from the southern extreme of western canada to the border of the arkansas river watershed
compared with the mississippi river above their confluence the missouri is twice as long and drains an area three times as large
the missouri accounts for <num> percent of the annual flow of the mississippi past st
louis and as much as <num> percent in certain droughts
in <year> the missouri river watershed was home to about <num> million people
this included the entire population of the u
s
state of nebraska parts of the u
s
states of colorado iowa kansas minnesota missouri montana north dakota south dakota and wyoming and small southern portions of the canadian provinces of alberta and saskatchewan
the watershed 's largest city is denver colorado with a population of more than six hundred thousand
denver is the main city of the front range urban corridor whose cities had a combined population of over four million in <year> making it the largest metropolitan area in the missouri river basin
other major population centers – mostly located in the southeastern portion of the watershed – include omaha nebraska situated north of the confluence of the missouri and platte rivers kansas city missouri – kansas city kansas located at the confluence of the missouri with the kansas river and the st
louis metropolitan area situated south of the missouri river just below the latter 's mouth on the mississippi
in contrast the northwestern part of the watershed is sparsely populated
however many northwestern cities such as billings montana are among the fastest growing in the missouri basin
with more than <num> @,@ <num> square miles <num> @,@ <num> km2 under the plow the missouri river watershed includes roughly one @-@ fourth of all the agricultural land in the united states providing more than a third of the country 's wheat flax barley and oats
however only <num> @,@ <num> square miles <num> @,@ <num> km2 of farmland in the basin is irrigated
a further <num> @,@ <num> square miles <num> @,@ <num> km2 of the basin is devoted to the raising of livestock mainly cattle
forested areas of the watershed mostly second @-@ growth total about <num> @,@ <num> square miles <num> @,@ <num> km2
urban areas on the other hand comprise less than <num> @,@ <num> square miles <num> @,@ <num> km2 of land
most built @-@ up areas are located along the main stem and a few major tributaries including the platte and yellowstone rivers
elevations in the watershed vary widely ranging from just over <num> feet <num> m at the missouri 's mouth to the <num> @,@ <num> @-@ foot <num> @,@ <num> m summit of mount lincoln in central colorado
the river itself drops a total of <num> @,@ <num> feet <num> @,@ <num> m from brower 's spring the farthest source
although the plains of the watershed have extremely little local vertical relief the land rises about <num> feet per mile <num>
<num> m km from east to west
the elevation is less than <num> feet <num> m at the eastern border of the watershed but is over <num> @,@ <num> feet <num> m above sea level in many places at the base of the rockies
the missouri 's drainage basin has highly variable weather and rainfall patterns overall the watershed is defined by a continental climate with warm wet summers and harsh cold winters
most of the watershed receives an average of <num> to <num> inches <num> to <num> mm of precipitation each year
however the westernmost portions of the basin in the rockies as well as southeastern regions in missouri may receive as much as <num> inches <num> @,@ <num> mm
the vast majority of precipitation occurs in winter although the upper basin is known for short @-@ lived but intense summer thunderstorms such as the one which produced the <year> black hills flood through rapid city south dakota
winter temperatures in montana wyoming and colorado may drop as low as − <num> ° f − <num> ° c while summer highs in kansas and missouri have reached <num> ° f <num> ° c at times
as one of the continent 's most significant river systems the missouri 's drainage basin borders on many other major watersheds of the united states and canada
the continental divide running along the spine of the rocky mountains forms most of the western border of the missouri watershed
the clark fork and snake river both part of the columbia river basin drain the area west of the rockies in montana idaho and western wyoming
the columbia missouri and colorado river watersheds meet at three waters mountain in wyoming 's wind river range
south of there the missouri basin is bordered on the west by the drainage of the green river a tributary of the colorado then on the south by the mainstem of the colorado
both the colorado and columbia rivers flow to the pacific ocean
however a large endorheic drainage called the great divide basin exists between the missouri and green watersheds in western wyoming
this area is sometimes counted as part of the missouri river watershed even though its waters do not flow to either side of the continental divide
to the north the much lower laurentian divide separates the missouri river watershed from those of the oldman river a tributary of the south saskatchewan river as well as the souris sheyenne and smaller tributaries of the red river of the north
all of these streams are part of canada 's nelson river drainage basin which empties into hudson bay
there are also several large endorheic basins between the missouri and nelson watersheds in southern alberta and saskatchewan
the minnesota and des moines rivers tributaries of the upper mississippi drain most of the area bordering the eastern side of the missouri river basin
finally on the south the ozark mountains and other low divides through central missouri kansas and colorado separate the missouri watershed from those of the white river and arkansas river also tributaries of the mississippi river
most rivers and streams in the missouri river basin flow from west to east following the incline of the great plains however some eastern tributaries such as the james big sioux and grand river systems flow from north to south
the missouri 's largest tributaries by runoff are the yellowstone in montana and wyoming the platte in wyoming colorado and nebraska and the kansas – republican smoky hill and osage in kansas and missouri
each of these tributaries drains an area greater than <num> @,@ <num> square miles <num> @,@ <num> km2 and has an average discharge greater than <num> @,@ <num> cu ft s <num> <num> s
the yellowstone river has the highest discharge even though the platte is longer and drains a larger area
in fact the yellowstone 's flow is about <num> @,@ <num> cu ft s <num> <num> s – accounting for sixteen percent of total runoff in the missouri basin and nearly double that of the platte
on the other end of the scale is the tiny roe river in montana which at <num> feet <num> m long is one the world 's shortest rivers
the table on the right lists the ten longest tributaries of the missouri along with their respective catchment areas and flows
length is measured to the hydrologic source regardless of naming convention
the main stem of the kansas river for example is <num> miles <num> km long
however including the longest headwaters tributaries the <num> @-@ mile <num> km republican river and the <num> @-@ mile <num> km arikaree river brings the total length to <num> miles <num> @,@ <num> km
similar naming issues are encountered with the platte river whose longest tributary the north platte river is more than twice as long as its mainstream
the missouri 's headwaters above three forks extend much farther upstream than the main stem
measured to the farthest source at brower 's spring the jefferson river is <num> miles <num> km long
thus measured to its highest headwaters the missouri river stretches for <num> @,@ <num> miles <num> @,@ <num> km
when combined with the lower mississippi the missouri and its headwaters form part of the fourth @-@ longest river system in the world at <num> @,@ <num> miles <num> @,@ <num> km

as the missouri drains a predominantly semi @-@ arid region its discharge is much lower and more variable than other north american rivers of comparable length
before the construction of dams the river flooded twice each year – once in the april rise or spring fresh with the melting of snow on the plains of the watershed and in the june rise caused by snowmelt and summer rainstorms in the rocky mountains
the latter was far more destructive with the river increasing to over ten times its normal discharge in some years
the missouri 's discharge is affected by over <num> @,@ <num> reservoirs with an aggregate capacity of some <num> million acre feet <num> km3
by providing flood control the reservoirs dramatically reduce peak flows and increase low flows
evaporation from reservoirs significantly reduces the river 's runoff causing an annual loss of over <num> million acre feet <num>
<num> km3 from mainstem reservoirs alone
the united states geological survey operates fifty @-@ one stream gauges along the missouri river
the river 's average discharge at bismarck <num> @,@ <num>

this is from a drainage area of <num> @,@ <num> sq mi <num> @,@ <num> km2 or <num> of the total river basin
at kansas city <num>

the river here drains about <num> @,@ <num> sq mi <num> @,@ <num> @,@ <num> km2 representing about <num> of the entire basin
the lowermost gage with a period of record greater than fifty years is at hermann missouri – <num>
<num> miles <num>
<num> km upstream of the mouth of the missouri – where the average annual flow was <num> @,@ <num> cu ft s <num> @,@ <num> <num> s from <year> to <year>
about <num> @,@ <num> sq mi <num> @,@ <num> @,@ <num> km2 or <num>

the lowest a mere <num> cu ft s <num>
<num> <num> s – caused by the formation of an ice dam – was measured on december <num> <year>
the lower missouri river is the <num> river miles until it meets the mississippi just above st
louis
the lower missouri river has no hydroelectric or lock and dams but it has a plethora of wing dams that enable barge traffic by directing the flow of the river into a <num> foot wide <num> foot deep channel
these wing dams have been put in place and maintained by the u
s
army corps of engineers and there currently are no plans to construct any lock and dams to replace these wing dams on the missouri river
this orogeny uplifted cretaceous rocks along the western side of the western interior seaway a vast shallow sea that stretched from the arctic ocean to the gulf of mexico and deposited the sediments that now underlie much of the drainage basin of the missouri river
this laramide uplift caused the sea to retreat and laid the framework for a vast drainage system of rivers flowing from the rocky and appalachian mountains the predecessor of the modern @-@ day mississippi watershed
the laramide orogeny is essential to modern missouri river hydrology as snow and ice melt from the rockies provide the majority of the flow in the missouri and its tributaries
the missouri and many of its tributaries cross the great plains flowing over or cutting into the ogallala group and older mid @-@ cenozoic sedimentary rocks
the lowest major cenozoic unit the white river formation was deposited between roughly <num> and <num> million years ago and consists of claystone sandstone limestone and conglomerate
channel sandstones and finer @-@ grained overbank deposits of the fluvial arikaree group were deposited between <num> and <num> million years ago
the miocene @-@ age ogallala and the slightly younger pliocene @-@ age broadwater formation deposited atop the arikaree group and are formed from material eroded off of the rocky mountains during a time of increased generation of topographic relief these formations stretch from the rocky mountains nearly to the iowa border and give the great plains much of their gentle but persistent eastward tilt and also constitute a major aquifer
immediately before the quaternary ice age the missouri river was likely split into three segments an upper portion that drained northwards into hudson bay and middle and lower sections that flowed eastward down the regional slope
as the earth plunged into the ice age a pre @-@ illinoian or possibly the illinoian glaciation diverted the missouri river southeastwards towards its present confluence with the mississippi and caused it to integrate into a single river system that cuts across the regional slope
in western montana the missouri river is thought to have once flowed north then east around the bear paw mountains
sapphires are found in some spots along the river in western montana
advances of the continental ice sheets diverted the river and its tributaries causing them to pool up into large temporary lakes such as glacial lakes great falls musselshell and others
as the lakes rose the water in them often spilled across adjacent local drainage divides creating now @-@ abandoned channels and coulees including the shonkin sag <num> miles <num> km long
when the glaciers retreated the missouri flowed in a new course along the south side of the bearpaws and the lower part of the milk river tributary took over the original main channel
the missouri 's nickname the big muddy was inspired by its enormous loads of sediment or silt – some of the largest of any north american river
in its pre @-@ development state the river transported some <num> to <num> million short tons <num> to <num> mt per year
the construction of dams and levees has drastically reduced this to <num> to <num> million short tons <num> to <num> mt in the present day
much of this sediment is derived from the river 's floodplain also called the meander belt every time the river changed course it would erode tons of soil and rocks from its banks
however damming and channeling the river has kept it from reaching its natural sediment sources along most of its course
reservoirs along the missouri trap roughly <num>
<num> million short tons <num>
<num> mt of sediment each year
despite this the river still transports more than half the total silt that empties into the gulf of mexico the mississippi river delta formed by sediment deposits at the mouth of the mississippi constitutes a majority of sediments carried by the missouri
during the end of the last glacial period a great migration of humans began traveling via the bering land bridge from eurasia into and throughout the americas
as they traveled slowly over centuries the missouri river formed one of the main migration paths
most settled in the ohio valley and the lower mississippi river valley but many including the mound builders stayed along the missouri becoming the ancestors of the later indigenous peoples of the great plains
the native americans that lived along the missouri had access to ample food water and shelter
many migratory animals inhabited the plains at the time providing them meat clothing and other everyday items there were also great riparian areas in the river 's floodplain that provided them with natural herbs and staple foods
no written records from the tribes and peoples of the pre @-@ european period exist because they did not use writing
according to the writings of explorers some of the major tribes along the missouri river included the otoe missouria omaha ponca brulé lakota sioux arikara hidatsa mandan assiniboine gros ventres and blackfeet
natives used the missouri at least to a limited extent as a path of trade and transport
in addition the river and its tributaries formed tribal boundaries
lifestyles of the indigenous mostly centered on a semi @-@ nomadic culture many tribes would have different summer and winter camps
however the center of native american wealth and trade lay along the missouri river in the dakotas region on its great bend south
a large cluster of walled mandan hidatsa and arikara villages situated on bluffs and islands of the river was home to thousands and later served as a market and trading post used by early french and british explorers and fur traders
following the introduction of horses to missouri river tribes possibly from feral european @-@ introduced populations natives way of life changed dramatically
the use of the horse allowed them to travel greater distances and thus facilitated hunting communications and trade
once tens of millions of american bison commonly called buffalo one of the keystone species of the great plains and the ohio valley roamed the plains of the missouri river basin
most native american groups in the basin relied heavily on the bison as a food source and their hides and bones served to create other household items
in time the species came to benefit from the indigenous peoples periodic controlled burnings of the grasslands surrounding the missouri to clear out old and dead growth
the large bison population of the region gave rise to the term great bison belt an area of rich annual grasslands that extended from alaska to mexico along the eastern flank of the continental divide
however after the arrival of europeans in north america both the bison and the native americans saw a rapid decline in population
hunting eliminated bison populations east of the mississippi river by <year> and reduced the numbers in the missouri basin to a mere few hundred
foreign diseases such as smallpox raged across the land decimating native american populations
left without their primary source of sustenance many of the remaining indigenous people were amalgamated into resettlement areas and reservations
ignace on lake huron and traveled down the wisconsin and mississippi rivers aiming to reach the pacific ocean
in late june jolliet and marquette became the first documented european discoverers of the missouri river which according to their journals was in full flood
i never saw anything more terrific jolliet wrote a tangle of entire trees from the mouth of the pekistanoui missouri with such impetuosity that one could not attempt to cross it without great danger
the commotion was such that the water was made muddy by it and could not clear itself
they recorded pekitanoui or pekistanoui as the local name for the missouri
however the party never explored the missouri beyond its mouth nor did they linger in the area
in addition they later learned that the mississippi drained into the gulf of mexico and not the pacific as they had originally presumed the expedition turned back about <num> miles <num> km short of the gulf at the confluence of the arkansas river with the mississippi
in <year> france expanded its territorial claims in north america to include land on the western side of the mississippi river which included the lower portion of the missouri
however the missouri itself remained formally unexplored until étienne de veniard sieur de bourgmont commanded an expedition in <year> that reached at least as far as the mouth of the platte river
it is unclear exactly how far bourgmont traveled beyond there he described the blond @-@ haired mandans in his journals so it is likely he reached as far as their villages in present @-@ day north dakota
later that year bourgmont published the route to be taken to ascend the missouri river the first known document to use the name missouri river many of the names he gave to tributaries mostly for the native tribes that lived along them are still in use today
the expedition 's discoveries eventually found their way to cartographer guillaume delisle who used the information to create a map of the lower missouri
in <year> jean @-@ baptiste le moyne sieur de bienville requested that the french government bestow upon bourgmont the cross of st
louis because of his outstanding service to france
bourgmont had in fact been in trouble with the french colonial authorities since <year> when he deserted his post as commandant of fort detroit after poorly handling an attack by the ottawa that resulted in thirty @-@ one deaths
however his reputation was enhanced in <year> when the pawnee – who had earlier been befriended by bourgmont – massacred the spanish villasur expedition near present @-@ day columbus nebraska on the missouri river and temporarily ending spanish encroachment on french louisiana
bourgmont established fort orleans the first european settlement of any kind on the missouri river near present @-@ day brunswick missouri in <year>
the following year bourgmont led an expedition to enlist comanche support against the spanish who continued to show interest in taking over the missouri
in <year> bourgmont brought the chiefs of several missouri river tribes to visit france
there he was raised to the rank of nobility and did not accompany the chiefs back to north america
fort orleans was either abandoned or its small contingent massacred by native americans in <year>
the french and indian war erupted when territorial disputes between france and great britain in north america reached a head in <year>
by <year> france was defeated by the much greater strength of the british army and was forced to cede its canadian possessions to the english and louisiana to the spanish in the treaty of paris amounting to most of its colonial holdings in north america
initially the spanish did not extensively explore the missouri and let french traders continue their activities under license
however this ended after news of the british hudson 's bay company incursions in the upper missouri river watershed was brought back following an expedition by jacques d 'eglise in the early <num>
in <year> the spanish chartered the company of discoverers and explorers of the missouri popularly referred to as the missouri company and offered a reward for the first person to reach the pacific ocean via the missouri
in <year> and <year> expeditions led by jean baptiste truteau and antoine simon lecuyer de la jonchšre did not even make it as far north as the mandan villages in central north dakota
arguably the most successful of the missouri company expeditions was that of james mackay and john evans
the two set out along the missouri and established fort charles about <num> miles <num> km south of present @-@ day sioux city as a winter camp in <year>
at the mandan villages in north dakota they expelled several british traders and while talking to the populace they pinpointed the location of the yellowstone river which was called roche jaune yellow rock by the french
although mackay and evans failed to accomplish their original goal of reaching the pacific they did create the first accurate map of the upper missouri river
in <year> the young united states and spain signed pinckney 's treaty which recognized american rights to navigate the mississippi river and store goods for export in new orleans
three years later spain revoked the treaty and in <year> secretly returned louisiana to napoleonic france in the third treaty of san ildefonso
this transfer was so secret that the spanish continued to administer the territory
in <year> spain restored rights to use the mississippi and new orleans to the united states
fearing that the cutoffs could occur again president thomas jefferson proposed to buy the port of new orleans from france for <num> million
instead faced with a debt crisis napoleon offered to sell the entirety of louisiana including the missouri river for <num> million – amounting to less than <num> ¢ per acre
the deal was signed in <year> doubling the size of the united states with the acquisition of the louisiana territory
in <year> jefferson instructed meriwether lewis to explore the missouri and search for a water route to the pacific ocean
by then it had been discovered that the columbia river system which drains into the pacific had a similar latitude as the headwaters of the missouri river and it was widely believed that a connection or short portage existed between the two
however spain balked at the takeover citing that they had never formally returned louisiana to the french
spanish authorities warned lewis not to take the journey and forbade him from seeing the mackay and evans map of the missouri although lewis eventually managed to gain access to it
meriwether lewis and william clark began their famed expedition in <year> with a party of thirty @-@ three people in three boats
although they became the first europeans to travel the entire length of the missouri and reach the pacific ocean via the columbia they found no trace of the northwest passage
the maps made by lewis and clark especially those of the pacific northwest region provided a foundation for future explorers and emigrants
they also negotiated relations with multiple native american tribes and wrote extensive reports on the climate ecology and geology of the region
many present @-@ day names of geographic features in the upper missouri basin originated from their expedition
they came from many different places – some from the canadian fur corporations at hudson bay some from the pacific northwest see also maritime fur trade and some from the midwestern united states
most did not stay in the area for long as they failed to find significant resources
the first glowing reports of country rich with thousands of game animals came in <year> when meriwether lewis and william clark returned from their two @-@ year expedition
their journals described lands rich with thousands of buffalo beaver and river otter and also an abundant population of sea otters on the pacific northwest coast
in <year> explorer manuel lisa organized an expedition which would lead to the explosive growth of the fur trade in the upper missouri river country
lisa and his crew traveled up the missouri and yellowstone rivers trading manufactured items in return for furs from local native american tribes and established a fort at the confluence of the yellowstone and a tributary the bighorn in southern montana
although the business started small it quickly grew into a thriving trade
lisa 's men started construction of fort raymond which sat on a bluff overlooking the confluence of the yellowstone and bighorn in the fall of <year>
the fort would serve primarily as a trading post for bartering with the native americans for furs
this method was unlike that of the pacific northwest fur trade which involved trappers hired by the various fur enterprises namely hudson 's bay
fort raymond was later replaced by fort lisa at the confluence of the missouri and yellowstone in north dakota a second fort also called fort lisa was built downstream on the missouri river in nebraska
in <year> the st
louis missouri fur company was founded by lisa in conjunction with william clark and pierre choteau among others
in <year> the american fur company founded fort union at the confluence of the missouri and yellowstone rivers
fort union gradually became the main headquarters for the fur trade in the upper missouri basin
fur trapping activities in the early <num> century encompassed nearly all of the rocky mountains on both the eastern and western slopes
trappers of the hudson 's bay company st
louis missouri fur company american fur company rocky mountain fur company north west company and other outfits worked thousands of streams in the missouri watershed as well as the neighboring columbia colorado arkansas and saskatchewan river systems
during this period the trappers also called mountain men blazed trails through the wilderness that would later form the paths pioneers and settlers would travel by into the west
transport of the thousands of beaver pelts required ships providing one of the first large motives for river transport on the missouri to start
as the <num> drew to a close the fur industry slowly began to die as silk replaced beaver fur as a desirable clothing item
by this time also the beaver population of streams in the rocky mountains had been decimated by intense hunting
furthermore frequent native american attacks on trading posts made it dangerous for employees of the fur companies
in some regions the industry continued well into the <num> but in others such as the platte river valley declines of the beaver population contributed to an earlier demise
the fur trade finally disappeared in the great plains around <year> with the primary center of industry shifting to the mississippi valley and central canada
despite the demise of the once @-@ prosperous trade however its legacy led to the opening of the american west and a flood of settlers farmers ranchers adventurers hopefuls financially bereft and entrepreneurs took their place
the major trails for the opening of the american west all have their starting points on the river including the california mormon oregon and santa fe trails
the first westward leg of the pony express was a ferry across the missouri at st
joseph missouri
similarly most emigrants arrived at the eastern terminus of the first transcontinental railroad via a ferry ride across the missouri between council bluffs iowa and omaha
the hannibal bridge became the first bridge to cross the missouri river in <year> and its location was a major reason why kansas city became the largest city on the river upstream from its mouth at st
louis
true to the then @-@ ideal of manifest destiny over <num> @,@ <num> people set out from the river town of independence missouri to their various destinations in the american west from the <num> to the <num>
these people had many reasons to embark on this strenuous year @-@ long journey – economic crisis and later gold strikes including the california gold rush for example
for most the route took them up the missouri to omaha nebraska where they would set out along the platte river which flows from the rocky mountains in wyoming and colorado eastwards through the great plains
an early expedition led by robert stuart from <year> to <year> proved the platte impossible to navigate by the dugout canoes they used let alone the large sidewheelers and sternwheelers that would later ply the missouri in increasing numbers
one explorer remarked that the platte was too thick to drink too thin to plow
nevertheless the platte provided an abundant and reliable source of water for the pioneers as they headed west
covered wagons popularly referred to as prairie schooners provided the primary means of transport until the beginning of regular boat service on the river in the <num>
during the <num> gold strikes in montana colorado wyoming and northern utah attracted another wave of hopefuls to the region
although some freight was hauled overland most transport to and from the gold fields was done through the missouri and kansas rivers as well as the snake river in western wyoming and the bear river in utah idaho and wyoming
it is estimated that of the passengers and freight hauled from the midwest to montana over <num> percent were transported by boat a journey that took <num> days in the upstream direction
a route more directly west into colorado lay along the kansas river and its tributary the republican river as well as pair of smaller colorado streams big sandy creek and the south platte river to near denver
the gold rushes precipitated the decline of the bozeman trail as a popular emigration route as it passed through land held by often @-@ hostile native americans
safer paths were blazed to the great salt lake near corinne utah during the gold rush period which led to the large @-@ scale settlement of the rocky mountains region and eastern great basin
as settlers expanded their holdings into the great plains they ran into land conflicts with native american tribes
this resulted in frequent raids massacres and armed conflicts leading to the federal government creating multiple treaties with the plains tribes which generally involved establishing borders and reserving lands for the indigenous
as with many other treaties between the u
s
and native americans they were soon broken leading to huge wars
over <num> @,@ <num> battles big and small were fought between the u
s
military and native americans before the tribes were forced out of their land onto reservations
conflicts between natives and settlers over the opening of the bozeman trail in the dakotas wyoming and montana led to red cloud 's war in which the lakota and cheyenne fought against the u
s
army
the fighting resulted in a complete native american victory
in <year> the treaty of fort laramie was signed which guaranteed the use of the black hills powder river country and other regions surrounding the northern missouri river to native americans without white intervention
the missouri river was also a significant landmark as it divides northeastern kansas from western missouri pro @-@ slavery forces from missouri would cross the river into kansas and spark mayhem during bleeding kansas leading to continued tension and hostility even today between kansas and missouri
another significant military engagement on the missouri river during this period was the <year> battle of boonville which did not affect native americans but rather was a turning point in the american civil war that allowed the union to seize control of transport on the river discouraging the state of missouri from joining the confederacy
however the peace and freedom of the native americans did not last for long
the great sioux war of <year> – <num> was sparked when american miners discovered gold in the black hills of western south dakota and eastern wyoming
these lands were originally set aside for native american use by the treaty of fort laramie
when the settlers intruded onto the lands they were attacked by native americans
u
s
troops were sent to the area to protect the miners and drive out the natives from the new settlements
during this bloody period both the native americans and the u
s
military won victories in major battles resulting in the loss of nearly a thousand lives
the war eventually ended in an american victory and the black hills were opened to settlement
native americans of that region were relocated to reservations in wyoming and southeastern montana
river development was stimulated by a variety of factors first by growing demand for electricity in the rural northwestern parts of the basin and also by floods and droughts that plagued rapidly growing agricultural and urban areas along the lower missouri river
small privately owned hydroelectric projects have existed since the <num> but the large flood @-@ control and storage dams that characterize the middle reaches of the river today were not constructed until the <num>
between <year> and <year> five dams were built in the vicinity of great falls to generate power from the great falls of the missouri a chain of giant waterfalls formed by the river in its path through western montana
black eagle dam built in <year> on black eagle falls was the first dam of the missouri
replaced in <year> with a more modern structure the dam was little more than a small weir atop black eagle falls diverting part of the missouri 's flow into the black eagle power plant
the largest of the five dams ryan dam was built in <year>
the dam lies directly above the <num> @-@ foot <num> m great falls the largest waterfall of the missouri
in the same period several private establishments – most notably the montana power company – began to develop the missouri river above great falls and below helena for power generation
a small run @-@ of @-@ the river structure completed in <year> near the present site of canyon ferry dam became the second dam to be built on the missouri
this rock @-@ filled timber crib dam generated seven and a half megawatts of electricity for helena and the surrounding countryside
the nearby steel hauser dam was finished in <year> but failed in <year> because of structural deficiencies causing catastrophic flooding all the way downstream past craig
at great falls a section of the black eagle dam was dynamited to save nearby factories from inundation
hauser was rebuilt in <year> as a concrete gravity structure and stands to this day
holter dam about <num> miles <num> km downstream of helena was the third hydroelectric dam built on this stretch of the missouri river
when completed in <year> by the montana power company and the united missouri river power company its reservoir flooded the gates of the mountains a limestone canyon which meriwether lewis described as the most remarkable clifts that we have yet seen … the tow er ing and projecting rocks in many places seem ready to tumble on us
in <year> the u
s
bureau of reclamation usbr began construction on the modern canyon ferry dam to provide flood control to the great falls area
by <year> the rising waters of canyon ferry lake submerged the old <year> dam whose powerhouse still stands underwater about <num>
<num> miles <num>
<num> km upstream of the present @-@ day dam
the missouri 's temperament was uncertain as the actions of a jury or the state of a woman 's mind
– sioux city register march <num> <year> the missouri basin suffered a series of catastrophic floods around the turn of the <num> century most notably in <year> <year> and <year> – <year>
in <year> as part of the great depression @-@ era new deal the u
s
army corps of engineers usace completed fort peck dam in montana
construction of this massive public works project provided jobs for more than <num> @,@ <num> laborers during the depression and was a major step in providing flood control to the lower half of the missouri river
however fort peck only controls runoff from <num> percent of the missouri river watershed and had little effect on a severe snowmelt flood that struck the lower basin three years later
this event was particularly destructive as it submerged manufacturing plants in omaha and kansas city greatly delaying shipments of military supplies in world war ii
flooding damages on the mississippi – missouri river system were one of the primary reasons for which congress passed the flood control act of <year> opening the way for the usace to develop the missouri on a massive scale
the <year> act authorized the pick – sloan missouri basin program pick – sloan plan which was a composite of two widely varying proposals
the pick plan with an emphasis on flood control and hydroelectric power called for the construction of large storage dams along the main stem of the missouri
the sloan plan which stressed the development of local irrigation included provisions for roughly <num> smaller dams on tributaries
in the early stages of pick – sloan development tentative plans were made to build a low dam on the missouri at riverdale north dakota and <num> smaller dams on the yellowstone river and its tributaries
this was met with controversy from inhabitants of the yellowstone basin and eventually the usbr proposed a solution to greatly increase the size of the proposed dam at riverdale – today 's garrison dam thus replacing the storage that would have been provided by the yellowstone dams
because of this decision the yellowstone is now the longest free @-@ flowing river in the contiguous united states
in the <num> construction commenced on the five mainstem dams – garrison oahe big bend fort randall and gavins point – proposed under the pick @-@ sloan plan
along with fort peck which was integrated as a unit of the pick @-@ sloan plan in the <num> these dams now form what is known as the missouri river mainstem system
the six dams of the mainstem system chiefly fort peck garrison and oahe are among the largest dams in the world by volume their sprawling reservoirs also rank within the biggest of the nation
holding up to <num>
<num> million acre feet <num>
<num> km3 in total the six reservoirs can store more than three years worth of the river 's flow as measured below gavins point the lowermost dam
this capacity makes it the largest reservoir system in the united states and one of the largest in north america
in addition to storing irrigation water the system also includes an annual flood @-@ control reservation of <num>
<num> million acre feet <num>
<num> km3
mainstem power plants generate about <num>
<num> billion kwh annually – equal to a constant output of almost <num> @,@ <num> megawatts
along with nearly <num> smaller dams on tributaries namely the bighorn platte kansas and osage rivers the system provides irrigation water to nearly <num> @,@ <num> sq mi <num> @,@ <num> km2 of land
the table at left lists statistics of all fifteen dams on the missouri river ordered downstream
many of the run @-@ of @-@ the @-@ river dams on the missouri marked in yellow form very small impoundments which may or may not have been given names those unnamed are left blank
all dams are on the upper half of the river above sioux city the lower river is uninterrupted due to its longstanding use as a shipping channel
even under the very best of circumstances it was never a huge industry
richard opper former missouri river basin association executive director boat travel on the missouri started with the wood @-@ framed canoes and bull boats of the native americans which were used for thousands of years before the introduction of larger craft to the river upon colonization of the great plains
the first steamboat on the missouri was the independence which started running between st
louis and keytesville missouri around <year>
by the <num> large mail and freight @-@ carrying vessels were running regularly between kansas city and st
louis and many traveled even farther upstream
a handful such as the western engineer and the yellowstone were able to make it up the river as far as eastern montana
during the early <num> century at the height of the fur trade steamboats and keelboats began traveling nearly the whole length of the missouri from montana 's rugged missouri breaks to the mouth carrying beaver and buffalo furs to and from the areas that the trappers frequented
this resulted in the development of the missouri river mackinaw which specialized in carrying furs
since these boats could only travel downriver they were dismantled and sold for lumber upon their arrival at st
louis
water transport increased through the <num> with multiple craft ferrying pioneers emigrants and miners many of these runs were from st
louis or independence to near omaha
there most of these people would set out overland along the large but shallow and unnavigable platte river which was described by pioneers as a mile wide and an inch deep and the most magnificent and useless of rivers
steamboat navigation peaked in <year> with over <num> boats operating full @-@ time on the missouri with many more smaller vessels
many of the earlier vessels were built on the ohio river before being transferred to the missouri
side @-@ wheeler steamboats were preferred over the larger sternwheelers used on the mississippi and ohio because of their greater maneuverability
the industry 's success however did not guarantee safety
in the early decades before the river 's flow was controlled by man its sketchy rises and falls and its massive amounts of sediment which prevented a clear view of the bottom wrecked some <num> vessels
because of the dangers of navigating the missouri river the average ship 's lifespan was short only about four years
the development of the transcontinental and northern pacific railroads marked the beginning of the end of steamboat commerce on the missouri
outcompeted by trains the number of boats slowly dwindled until there was almost nothing left by the <num>
transport of agricultural and mining products by barge however saw a revival in the early twentieth century
in <year> the usace was authorized to maintain the missouri to a depth of six feet <num>
<num> m from the port of kansas city to the mouth a distance of <num> miles <num> km
this was accomplished by constructing levees and wing dams to direct the river 's flow into a straight narrow channel and prevent sedimentation
in <year> the usace began a project to widen the river 's navigation channel to <num> feet <num> m two years later they began dredging a deep @-@ water channel from kansas city to sioux city
these modifications have reduced the river 's length from some <num> @,@ <num> miles <num> @,@ <num> km in the late <num> century to <num> @,@ <num> miles <num> @,@ <num> km in the present day
construction of dams on the missouri under the pick @-@ sloan plan in the mid @-@ twentieth century was the final step in aiding navigation
the large reservoirs of the mainstem system help provide a dependable flow to maintain the navigation channel year @-@ round and are capable of halting most of the river 's annual freshets
however high and low water cycles of the missouri – notably the protracted early @-@ 21st @-@ century drought in the missouri river basin and historic floods in <year> and <year> – are difficult for even the massive mainstem system reservoirs to control
in <year> the usace began the missouri river bank stabilization and navigation project which would permanently increase the river 's navigation channel to a width of <num> feet <num> m and a depth of nine feet <num>
<num> m
during work that continues to this day the <num> @-@ mile <num> @,@ <num> km navigation channel from sioux city to st
louis has been controlled by building rock dikes to direct the river 's flow and scour out sediments sealing and cutting off meanders and side channels and dredging the riverbed
however the missouri has often resisted the efforts of the usace to control its depth
in <year> several u
s
coast guard boats ran aground in the missouri river because the navigation channel had been severely silted
the usace was blamed for failing to maintain the channel to the minimum depth
in <year> the missouri river navigation commission estimated the total amount of goods shipped on the river annually at <num> million tons <num>
<num> million metric tons providing widespread consensus for the creation of a navigation channel
however shipping traffic has since been far lower than expected – shipments of commodities including produce manufactured items lumber and oil averaged only <num> @,@ <num> tons <num> @,@ <num> t per year from <year> to <year>
by tonnage of transported material missouri is by far the largest user of the river accounting for <num> percent of river traffic while kansas has <num> percent nebraska three percent and iowa two percent
almost all of the barge traffic on the missouri river ships sand and gravel dredged from the lower <num> miles <num> km of the river the remaining portion of the shipping channel now sees little to no use by commercial vessels
in the <num> the usace predicted an increase to <num> million short tons <num> mt per year by <year> but instead the opposite has happened
the amount of goods plunged from <num>
<num> million short tons <num>
<num> mt in <year> to just <num>
<num> million short tons <num>
<num> mt in <year>
one of the largest drops has been in agricultural products especially wheat
part of the reason is that irrigated land along the missouri has only been developed to a fraction of its potential
in <year> barges on the missouri hauled only <num> @,@ <num> short tons <num> @,@ <num> t of products which is equal to the amount of daily freight traffic on the mississippi
drought conditions in the early 21st century and competition from other modes of transport – mainly railroads – are the primary reason for decreasing river traffic on the missouri
the failure of the usace to consistently maintain the navigation channel has also hampered the industry
currently efforts are being made to revive the shipping industry on the missouri river because of the efficiency and cheapness of river transport to haul agricultural products and the overcrowding of alternative transportation routes
solutions such as expanding the navigation channel and releasing more water from reservoirs during the peak of the navigation season are being considered
drought conditions lifted in <year> in which about <num> @,@ <num> short tons <num> @,@ <num> t were barged on the missouri representing the first significant increase in shipments since <year>
however flooding in <year> closed record stretches of the river to boat traffic – wash ing away hopes for a bounce @-@ back year
there are no lock and dams on the lower missouri river but there are plenty of wing dams that jettie out into the river and make it harder for barges to navigate
in contrast the upper mississippi has <num> locks and dams and averaged <num>
<num> million tons of cargo annually from <year> to <year> and its locks are closed in the winter
biodiversity generally increased proceeding downstream from the cold subalpine headwaters in montana to the temperate moist climate of missouri
today the river 's riparian zone consists primarily of cottonwoods willows and sycamores with several other types of trees such as maple and ash
average tree height generally increases farther from the riverbanks for a limited distance as land adjacent to the river is vulnerable to soil erosion during floods
because of its large sediment concentrations the missouri does not support many aquatic invertebrates
however the basin does support about <num> species of birds and <num> species of fish some of which are endangered such as the pallid sturgeon
the missouri 's aquatic and riparian habitats also support several species of mammals such as minks river otters beavers muskrats and raccoons
the world wide fund for nature divides the missouri river watershed into three freshwater ecoregions the upper missouri lower missouri and central prairie
the upper missouri roughly encompassing the area within montana wyoming southern alberta and saskatchewan and north dakota comprises mainly semiarid shrub @-@ steppe grasslands with sparse biodiversity because of ice age glaciations
there are no known endemic species within the region
except for the headwaters in the rockies there is little precipitation in this part of the watershed
the middle missouri ecoregion extending through colorado southwestern minnesota northern kansas nebraska and parts of wyoming and iowa has greater rainfall and is characterized by temperate forests and grasslands
plant life is more diverse in the middle missouri which is also home to about twice as many animal species
finally the central prairie ecoregion is situated on the lower part of the missouri encompassing all or parts of missouri kansas oklahoma and arkansas
despite large seasonal temperature fluctuations this region has the greatest diversity of plants and animals of the three
thirteen species of crayfish are endemic to the lower missouri
most of the river 's floodplain habitat is long gone replaced by irrigated agricultural land
development of the floodplain has led to increasing amounts of people and infrastructure within areas at high risk of inundation
levees have been constructed along more than a third of the river in order to keep floodwater within the channel but with the consequences of faster stream velocity and a resulting increase of peak flows in downstream areas
fertilizer runoff which causes elevated levels of nitrogen and other nutrients is a major problem along the missouri river especially in iowa and missouri
this form of pollution also heavily affects the upper mississippi illinois and ohio rivers
low oxygen levels in rivers and the vast gulf of mexico dead zone at the end of the mississippi delta are both results of high nutrient concentrations in the missouri and other tributaries of the mississippi
channelization of the lower missouri waters has made the river narrower deeper and less accessible to riparian flora and fauna
numerous dams and bank stabilization projects have been constructed to facilitate the conversion of <num> @,@ <num> acres <num> @,@ <num> km2 of missouri river floodplain to agricultural land
channel control has significantly reduced the volume of sediment transported downstream by the river and eliminated critical habitat for fish birds and amphibians
by the early 21st century declines in populations of native species prompted the u
s
fish and wildlife service to issue a biological opinion recommending restoration of river habitats for federally endangered bird and fish species
the usace began work on ecosystem restoration projects along the lower missouri river in the early 21st century
because of the low use of the shipping channel in the lower missouri maintained by the usace it is now considered feasible to remove some of the levees dikes and wing dams that constrict the river 's flow thus allowing it to naturally restore its banks
by <year> there were <num> @,@ <num> acres <num> km2 of riverside floodplain undergoing active restoration
restoration projects have re @-@ mobilized some of the sediments that had been trapped behind bank stabilization structures prompting concerns of exacerbated nutrient and sediment pollution locally and downstream in the northern gulf of mexico
a <year> national research council report assessed the roles of sediment in the missouri river evaluating current habitat restoration strategies and alternative ways to manage sediment
the report found that a better understanding of sediment processes in the missouri river including the creation of a sediment budget – an accounting of sediment transport erosion and deposition volumes for the length of the missouri river – would provide a foundation for projects to improve water quality standards and protect endangered species
visitation has increased from <num> million visitor @-@ hours in the mid @-@ <num> to over <num> million visitor @-@ hours in <year>
development of visitor facilities was spurred by the federal water project recreation act of <year> which required the usace to build and maintain boat ramps campgrounds and other public facilities along major reservoirs
recreational use of missouri river reservoirs is estimated to contribute <num> – <num> million to the regional economy each year
the lewis and clark national historic trail some <num> @,@ <num> miles <num> @,@ <num> km long follows nearly the entire missouri river from its mouth to its source retracing the route of the lewis and clark expedition
extending from wood river illinois in the east to astoria oregon in the west it also follows portions of the mississippi and columbia rivers
the trail which spans through eleven u
s
states is maintained by various federal and state government agencies it passes through some <num> historic sites notably archaeological locations including the knife river indian villages national historic site
parts of the river itself are designated for recreational or preservational use
the missouri national recreational river consists of portions of the missouri downstream from fort randall and gavins point dams that total <num> miles <num> km
these reaches exhibit islands meanders sandbars underwater rocks riffles snags and other once @-@ common features of the lower river that have now disappeared under reservoirs or have been destroyed by channeling
about forty @-@ five steamboat wrecks are scattered along these reaches of the river
downstream from great falls montana about <num> miles <num> km of the river course through a rugged series of canyons and badlands known as the missouri breaks
this part of the river designated a u
s
national wild and scenic river in <year> flows within the upper missouri breaks national monument a <num> @,@ <num> @-@ acre <num> @,@ <num> km2 preserve comprising steep cliffs deep gorges arid plains badlands archaeological sites and whitewater rapids on the missouri itself
the preserve includes a wide variety of plant and animal life recreational activities include boating rafting hiking and wildlife observation
in north @-@ central montana some <num> @,@ <num> @,@ <num> acres <num> @,@ <num> km2 along over <num> miles <num> km of the missouri river centering on fort peck lake comprise the charles m

the wildlife refuge consists of a native northern great plains ecosystem that has not been heavily affected by human development except for the construction of fort peck dam
although there are few designated trails the whole preserve is open to hiking and camping
many u

national parks such as glacier national park rocky mountain national park yellowstone national park and badlands national park are in the watershed
parts of other rivers in the basin are set aside for preservation and recreational use – notably the niobrara national scenic river which is a <num> @-@ mile <num> km protected stretch of the niobrara river one of the missouri 's longest tributaries
the missouri flows through or past many national historic landmarks which include three forks of the missouri fort benton montana big hidatsa village site fort atkinson nebraska and arrow rock historic district
it first aired on the fox network in the united states on may <num> <year>
in the episode mr
burns is jealous of megastore owner arthur fortune who is beloved by the people of springfield
in order to win the people 's love burns gathers the help of homer simpson professor frink and groundskeeper willie to capture the loch ness monster
the episode was written by john swartzwelder and directed by mark ervin
the idea for the episode was pitched by the simpsons writing staff who wanted to make an episode in which mr
burns becomes a thrillionaire a millionaire who goes on thrilling adventures
although it would originally be green a mistake in the overseas animation led to the loch ness monster looking pink a mistake that was ultimately too expensive to fix
in its original broadcast monty can 't buy me love was seen by approximately <num>
<num> million viewers and finished in <num> place in the ratings the week it aired
following the release of the simpsons the complete tenth season the episode received mixed reviews from critics
they agree when faced with the threat of having to talk to each other and arrive at a fortune megastore a venture of wealthy arthur fortune modelled on british entrepreneur richard branson
fortune easily charms the crowd and hands out dollar bills to his customers
this embarrasses the unpopular mr
burns who asks homer to help him be loved by all
as his first activity burns has homer throw silver dollars from the top of a tall building which instead of winning him popularity just causes injuries and terrifies the crowds below
next he writes out a check and tells homer to donate it to the springfield hospital but homer is mistakenly believed to be the donor and receives the credit
mr
burns appears on a radio show called jerry rude and the bathroom bunch and is mocked by rude
feeling disappointed mr
burns decides to go to scotland to capture the legendary loch ness monster with help from homer professor frink and groundskeeper willie
after little progress burns has the loch drained of water to expose the creature
after subduing the monster single @-@ handed although it is not shown it is mentioned that the monster swallowed him burns has it sent to springfield to be unveiled where nessie turns out to be friendly and charms all of the spectators
however during the unveiling of the monster burns is blinded by camera flashes
he runs into a camera which crashes and starts a fire the crowd panic and flee
following this disaster homer then cheers up burns by pointing out that being loved means you have to be nice to people everyday but being hated means you do not have to do anything
burns agrees with that logic saying i 'm a selfish old crank--and that fits me like a speedo in the aftermath of the incident homer and burns give nessie a job at the vegas town casino
it originally aired on the fox network in the united states on may <num> <year>
the inspiration for the episode came from the concept of thrillionaires a term the simpsons writers found in an issue of the economist to describe millionaires who do really incredible stunts and go on amazing adventures
the episode 's third act went through several incarnations and the writers had a lot of ideas about what burns should do once he has captured the loch ness monster
eventually the staff settled on the act 's current iteration which was conceived by simpsons writer george meyer
according to current showrunner al jean the color of the loch ness monster would originally be green but when the overseas animation was completed the loch ness monster had a kind of pinkish color
because it would be too expensive to re @-@ color all the cels in which the monster appears the staff decided to air the episode as it was even though the monster was in the wrong color
inside the fortune megastore simpsons staff writer ian maxtone @-@ graham can be seen
the episode features american comedian and composer michael mckean as jerry rude a parody on the radio personality howard stern
scully stated that mckean was very funny and that his stern impression was dead on the money
the simpsons staff originally asked stern if he wanted to guest @-@ star in the episode but he declined
actor and producer kevin costner was portrayed by series regular cast member hank azaria who voices moe szyslak among other characters in the series
azaria also played arthur fortune a character based on british business magnate richard branson
in the dvd commentary for the episode scully stated that branson would have been a great guest -actor in the episode
the episode also features groundskeeper willie 's father even though willie in an earlier episode said that he was killed for stealing a pig
arthur fortune is a parody of branson and fortune megastore is a reference to branson 's international record shop chain virgin megastores
on the cover of billionaire beat a magazine that burns reads in the episode business magnates bill gates and rupert murdoch can be seen
in a scene in the episode burns assumes that don mcneill and his breakfast club is currently the most popular radio program
don mcneill 's breakfast club was a real radio program that according to scully swartzwelder used to listen to
costner 's film the postman is also referenced in the episode
burns unveiling of the loch ness monster is ruined as the numerous camera flashes blind him causing him to knock over some lights starting a fire
this is a reference to the film king kong although in the film the flashes enrage the captured gorilla kong as opposed to his captor
<num> rating according to nielsen media research translating to approximately <num>
<num> million viewers
the episode finished in <num> place in the ratings for the week of april <num> @-@ may <num> <year>
on august <num> <year> the episode was released as part of the simpsons the complete tenth season dvd box set
mike scully george meyer ian maxtone @-@ graham ron hauge and matt selman participated in the dvd 's audio commentary of the episode
following its home video release monty can 't buy me love received mixed reviews from critics
giving the episode a positive review currentfilm
com considered it to be one of the best mr
burns @-@ centric episodes ever and that it has some classic burns moments especially when monty describes exactly what it took for him to capture the creature
colin jacobson of dvd movie guide stated that while the episode doesn ’ t do a lot to expand the character it manages a reasonable number of yuks
he added that a fun howard stern @-@ esque character done by michael mckean helps make this a nice show
david plath of dvd town wrote that the episode has some funny moments
giving the episode a mixed review warren martyn and adrian wood of i can 't believe it 's a bigger and better updated unofficial simpsons guide said that the episode is very funny when it 's funny very poor when it isn 't
they wrote that the best part of the episode is the scottish stuff and the idea that once again burns is actually worried about his public image as he was in the joy of sect
jake mcneill of digital entertainment news gave the episode a negative review and wrote that the story takes too long to get going
the assault troops mostly from the australian and new zealand army corps anzac landed at night on the western aegean sea side of the peninsula
they were put ashore one mile <num>
<num> km north of their intended landing beach
in the darkness the assault formations became mixed up but the troops gradually made their way inland under increasing opposition from the ottoman turkish defenders
not long after coming ashore the anzac plans were discarded and the companies and battalions were thrown into battle piece @-@ meal and received mixed orders
some advanced to their designated objectives while others were diverted to other areas then ordered to dig in along defensive ridge lines
although they failed to achieve their objectives by nightfall the anzacs had formed a beachhead albeit much smaller than intended
in places they were clinging onto cliff faces with no organised defence system
their precarious position convinced both divisional commanders to ask for an evacuation but after taking advice from the royal navy about how practicable that would be the army commander decided they would stay
the exact number of the day 's casualties is not known
the anzacs had landed two divisions but over two thousand of their men had been killed or wounded together with at least a similar number of turkish casualties
since <year> the anniversary of the landings on <num> april has been commemorated as anzac day becoming one of the most important national celebrations in australia and new zealand
the anniversary is also commemorated in turkey the united kingdom and ireland
the stalemate of trench warfare on the western front convinced the british imperial war cabinet that an attack on the central powers elsewhere particularly turkey could be the best way of winning the war
from february <year> this took the form of naval operations aimed at forcing a passage through the dardanelles but after several setbacks it was decided that a land campaign was also necessary
to that end the mediterranean expeditionary force was formed under the command of general ian hamilton
three amphibious landings were planned to secure the gallipoli peninsula which would allow the navy to attack the turkish capital constantinople in the hope that would convince the turks to ask for an armistice
the new zealand and australian division normally also had two mounted brigades assigned to it but these had been left in egypt as it was believed there would be no requirement or opportunities to use mounted troops on the peninsula
to bring the division up to strength hamilton had tried unsuccessfully to get a brigade of gurkhas attached to them
in total anzac strength was <num> @,@ <num> men
the location chosen for the operation was between the headland of gaba tepe and the fisherman 's hut three miles <num>
<num> km to the north
landing at dawn after a naval gunfire bombardment the first troops were to seize the lower crests and southern spurs of hill <num>
the second wave would pass them to capture the spur of hill <num> especially mal tepe
there they would be positioned to cut the enemy 's lines of communications to the kilid bahr plateau thus preventing the turks from bringing reinforcements from the north to the kilid bahr plateau during the attack by the british <num> division which would advance from a separate beachhead further south @-@ west
the capture of mal tepe was more vital and valuable than the capture of the kilid bahr plateau itself
birdwood planned to arrive off the peninsula after the moon had set with the first troops landing at <num> <num> an hour before dawn
he declined the offer of an old merchant ship loaded with troops being deliberately grounded at gaba tepe
instead the troops were to travel in naval and merchant ships transferring to rowing boats towed by small steamboats to make the assault
first ashore would be the australian division commanded by major @-@ general william bridges
the <num> australian brigade known as the covering force were to capture the third ridge from battleship hill south along the sari bair mountain range to gaba tepe
the <num> australian brigade landing next were to capture all the sari bar range up to hill <num> on the left
the <num> jacob 's mountain battery from the british indian army would land next and then the 1st australian brigade the division 's reserve all were to be ashore by <num> <num>
the new zealand and australian division commanded by major @-@ general alexander godley followed them the 1st new zealand brigade then the <num> australian brigade
only after the second division had landed would the advance to mal tepe begin
the planners had come to the conclusion that the area was sparsely if at all defended and that they should be able to achieve their objectives with no problems turkish opposition had not been considered
the pre @-@ war army had <num> @,@ <num> men in thirty @-@ six divisions formed into army corps and field armies
on mobilisation each division had three infantry and one artillery regiment for a total of around ten thousand men or about half the size of the equivalent british formation
unlike the largely inexperienced anzacs all the turkish army commanders down to company commander level were very experienced being veterans of the italo @-@ turkish and balkan wars
the british preparations could not be made in secret and by march <year> the turks were aware that a force of fifty thousand british and thirty thousand french troops was gathering at lemnos
they considered there were only four likely places for them to land cape helles gaba tepe bulair or on the asiatic eastern coast of the dardanelles
on <num> march the turks formed the fifth army a force of over <num> @,@ <num> men in two corps of six divisions and a cavalry brigade commanded by the german general otto liman von sanders
the fifth army deployed the iii corps at gallipoli and the xv corps on the asiatic coast
the <num> division and a cavalry brigade were on the european mainland positioned to support the iii corps if required
the iii corps had the <num> division <num> <num> and <num> infantry regiments the <num> division <num> <num> and <num> infantry regiments and the <num> division <num> <num> and 21st infantry regiments
the <num> division provided coastal defence from cape helles north to bulair where the <num> division took over while the <num> division at maidos was the corps reserve
the area around gaba tepe where the anzac landings would take place was defended by a battalion of the <num> infantry regiment
weather conditions delayed their departure from lemnos until dawn on <num> april
the royal navy battleships queen triumph prince of wales london and majestic the cruiser bacchante seven destroyers and four transport ships led the way carrying the <num> brigade
they were followed by the rest of the force who were embarked in their own transport ships
at <num> <num> a turkish sentry reported seeing ships moving at sea and at <num> <num> the report was sent to <num> division 's headquarters
at <num> <num> the ships headed towards the peninsula continuing until <num> <num> when the larger ships stopped
with <num> yards <num> m to go the rowing boats continued using only their oars
around <num> <num> turkish sentries opened fire on the boats but the first anzac troops were already ashore at beach z called ari burnu at the time but later known as anzac cove
it was formally renamed anzac cove by the turkish government in <year>
they were one mile <num>
<num> km further north than intended and instead of an open beach they were faced with steep cliffs and ridges up to around three hundred feet <num> m in height
however the mistake had put them ashore at a relatively undefended area at gaba tepe further south where they had planned to land there was a strong @-@ point with an artillery battery close by equipped with two <num> cm and two <num> cm guns and the <num> company <num> infantry regiment was positioned to counter @-@ attack any landing at that more southern point
the hills surrounding the cove where the anzacs landed made the beach safe from direct fire turkish artillery
fifteen minutes after the landing the royal navy began firing at targets in the hills
on their way in the rowing boats had become mixed up
the <num> battalion grounded to the north of ari burnu point while the <num> battalion hit the point or just south of it together with most of the <num> battalion
the plan was for them to cross the open ground and assault the first ridge line but they were faced with a hill that came down almost to the water line and there was confusion while the officers tried to work out their location under small arms fire from the <num> company <num> battalion <num> infantry regiment who had a platoon of between eighty and ninety men at anzac cove and a second platoon in the north around the fisherman 's hut
the third platoon was in a reserve position on the second ridge
they also manned the gaba tepe strong @-@ point equipped with two obsolescent multi @-@ barrelled nordenfelt machine @-@ guns and several smaller posts in the south
men from the <num> and <num> battalions started up the ari burnu slope grabbing the gorse branches or digging their bayonets into the soil to provide leverage
at the peak they found an abandoned trench the turks having withdrawn inland
soon the australians reached plugge 's plateau the edge of which was defended by a trench but the turks had withdrawn to the next summit two hundred yards <num> m inland from where they fired at the australians coming onto the plateau
as they arrived major edmund brockman of the <num> battalion started sorting out the mess sending the <num> battalion 's men to the right flank the <num> battalion 's to the left and keeping the <num> battalion in the centre
they also landed at anzac cove but now as planned the <num> were in the north <num> in the centre and the <num> in the south
the <num> battalion landed all along the beach
this extended the beachhead <num> yards <num> m to the north of ari burnu and <num>
<num> miles <num>
<num> km to the south
landing under fire some of the assaulting troops were killed in their boats and others as they reached the beach
once ashore they headed inland
in the south the first men from the <num> and <num> battalions reached the bottom of <num> plateau
in the north the first men from the <num> and <num> battalions started up walker 's ridge under fire from a nearby turkish trench
around the same time turkish artillery started bombarding the beachhead destroying at least six boats
the australians fought their way forward and reached russell 's top the turks withdrew through the nek to baby <num> <num> yards <num> m away
coming under fire again the australians went to ground having advanced only around one thousand yards <num> m inland
some also dug in at the nek a twenty yards <num> m piece of high ground between malone 's gully to the north and monash valley to the south
around this time colonel ewen sinclair @-@ maclagan commanding the <num> brigade decided to change the corps plan
concerned about a possible counter @-@ attack from the south he decided to hold the second ridge instead of pushing forward to the third or gun ridge
this hesitation suited the turkish defence plans which required the forward troops to gain time for the reserves to coordinate a counter @-@ attack
the two battalions were already assembled having spent that night carrying out military exercises
they could not be sent to ari burnu as it was not marked on the turkish maps
colonel halil sami commanding the <num> division also ordered the division 's machine @-@ gun company and an artillery battery to move in support of the <num> infantry regiment followed soon after by an <num> mm artillery battery
at <num> <num> lieutenant @-@ colonel mustafa kemal commanding the <num> division was ordered to send a battalion to support them
kemal instead decided to go himself with the <num> infantry regiment and an artillery battery towards chunuk bair which he realised was the key point in the defence whoever held those heights would dominate the battlefield
by chance the <num> infantry were supposed to have been on an exercise that morning around hill <num> and had been prepared since <num> <num> waiting for orders
at <num> <num> sefik and his two battalions were approaching kavak tepe and made contact with his <num> battalion that had conducted a fighting withdrawal and an hour and a half later the regiment was deployed to stop the anzacs advancing any further
around <num> <num> kemal arrived at scrubby knoll and steadied some retreating troops pushing them back into a defensive position
as they arrived the <num> infantry regiment were given their orders and prepared to counter @-@ attack
scrubby knoll known to the turks as kemalyeri kemal 's place now became the site of the turkish headquarters for the remainder of the campaign
it was named after its supposed height above sea level though its actual height is only <num> feet <num> m
maclagen sent the <num> battalion captain joseph lalor 's company of the <num> battalion and major james robertson 's of the <num> towards baby <num>
brockman divided his own company sending half up the right fork of rest gully and half up the left while brockman and a reserve platoon headed up monash valley
as they moved forward turkish artillery targeted them with air burst shrapnel shells which dispersed the companies
this coupled with senior officers diverting men to other areas instead of towards baby <num> meant only fragments of the units eventually reached baby <num>
arriving at baby <num> captain eric tulloch <num> battalion decided to take his remaining sixty men towards battleship hill leaving lalor 's company to dig in and defend the nek
tulloch moved around to the right before advancing towards the summit
the <num> battalion crossed the first rise unopposed but at the second turkish defenders around four hundred yards <num> m away opened fire on them
going to ground the australians returned fire
when the turkish fire slackened the remaining fifty men resumed their advance reaching the now evacuated turkish position behind which was a large depression with battleship hill beyond that
still under fire they moved forward again then around seven hundred yards <num> m from the summit the turks opened fire on them from a trench
the australians held out for thirty minutes but increasing turkish fire and mounting casualties convinced tulloch to withdraw
no other anzac unit would advance as far inland that day
at <num> <num> robertson and lalor decided to take their companies up baby <num>
instead of going round to the right like tulloch they went straight up the centre crossed over the summit onto the northern slope and went to ground
a spur on their left leading to suvla bay was defended by a turkish trench system
at <num> <num> turkish troops started moving down battleship hill and for the next hour they exchanged fire
where the spur joined baby <num> a group of australians from the <num> <num> and <num> battalions crossed malone 's gully and charged the turkish trench
a turkish machine @-@ gun on baby <num> opened fire on them forcing them back followed by a general withdrawal of australian troops
the turks had secured battleship hill and were now driving the australians off baby <num>
from his headquarters at the head of monash valley maclagen could see the turks attacking and started sending all available men towards baby <num>
the <num> brigade which was supposed to be heading for baby <num> on the left were instead sent to the right to counter a turkish attack building up there
at <num> <num> bridges and his staff landed finding no senior officers on the beach to brief them they set out to locate the <num> brigade headquarters
the 1st brigade was on the opposite flank to the <num> brigade and already getting involved in battles of its own when its commander colonel percy owen received a request from maclagen for reinforcements
owen sent two companies from the <num> battalion and one from the 1st battalion swannell 's to support the <num> brigade
soon after lalor 's company had been forced back to the nek and the turks were threatening to recapture russell 's top and at <num> <num> maclagen reported to bridges his doubts over being able to hold out
in response bridges sent part of his reserve two companies from the <num> battalion gordon 's and richardson 's to reinforce the <num> brigade
at <num> <num> swannell 's company arrived at the foot of baby <num> joining the seventy survivors of robertson 's and lalor 's companies
they immediately charged and chased the turks back over the summit of baby <num> then stopped and dug in
the two <num> battalion companies arrived alongside them but all the companies had taken casualties among the dead being swannell and robertson
by this time most of the <num> brigade men had been killed or wounded and the line was held by the five depleted companies from the 1st brigade
on the left gordon 's company <num> battalion with the <num> and <num> battalion 's survivors charged five times and captured the summit of baby <num> but were driven back by turkish counter @-@ attacks gordon was among the casualties
for the second time maclagen requested reinforcements for baby <num> but the only reserves bridges had available were two <num> battalion companies and the <num> battalion
it was now <num> <num> and the advance companies of the 1st new zealand brigade were disembarking so it was decided they would go to baby <num>
the auckland battalion had landed by <num> <num> and were being sent north along the beach to walker 's ridge on their way to russell 's top
seeing that the only way along the ridge was in single file along a goat track walker ordered them to take the route over plugge 's plateau
as each new zealand unit landed they were directed the same way to baby <num>
however in trying to avoid turkish fire they became split up in monash valley and rest gully and it was after midday that two of the auckland companies reached baby <num>
at <num> <num> two companies of the canterbury battalion landed and were sent to support the aucklands who had now been ordered back to plugge 's plateau and were forming on the left of the <num> brigade
the canterbury companies moved into the line on the aucklands left waiting for the rest of their brigade to land
however between <num> <num> and <num> <num> not one infantry or artillery formation came ashore
the ships carrying the new zealanders were in the bay but the steamers and rowing boats were being used to take the large numbers of wounded to the hospital ship
the transports with the <num> australian brigade on board were still well out at sea and not due to land until that evening
the landings recommenced around <num> <num> when the wellington battalion came ashore followed by the otago battalion around <num> <num> who were put into the line beside the aucklanders
next to land were the two other canterbury companies who were sent north to walker 's ridge to extend the corps left flank
events ashore now forced a change in the disembarkation schedule and at <num> <num> orders were issued for the <num> australian brigade to start landing to boost the defence
it would take until the next day for the complete brigade to come ashore
the transports carrying both divisions artillery batteries had been forced further out to sea by turkish artillery fire and were unable to land
in the coming days quinn 's steel 's and courtney 's posts would be built on the slope
the first anzac troops to reach the hill from the <num> battalion found that the turkish defenders had already withdrawn
as the australians crested the hill they came under fire from baby <num> but to their front was a short shallow slope into mule valley
when major james denton 's company of the <num> battalion arrived at the hill they started digging in and soon after received orders from maclagen to hold the position at all costs
at <num> <num> turkish troops advancing from scrubby knoll got to within three hundred yards <num> m of the australians on the hill opening fire at them
altogether there were two and a half companies from the <num> battalion between courtney 's post steele 's post and wire gully
they had not been there long before the <num> battalion arrived to reinforce them
the northern half of the plateau became known as johnston 's jolly and the southern half as lone pine with owen 's gully between them
the <num> battalion south of the plateau was to capture a turkish trench and artillery battery behind gun ridge
the <num> battalion furthest south was to attack the artillery battery at gaba tepe and the <num> battalion was the reserve with <num> jacob 's mountain battery to establish their gun line on the plateau
unknown to the anzacs the turks had an artillery battery sited on <num> plateau
after landing some of the <num> and <num> battalion 's men headed for <num> plateau
the first <num> battalion platoon to arrive was commanded by lieutenant noel loutit and accompanied by the brigade @-@ major charles brand
they discovered the turkish battery in the lone pine sector which was preparing to move
as the australians opened fire the battery withdrew down owen 's gully
brand remained on the plateau and ordered loutit to continue after the turkish battery
however the guns had been hidden at the head of the gully and loutit 's platoon moved beyond them
around the same time lieutenant eric smith and his <num> battalion scouts and lieutenant g
thomas with his platoon from the <num> battalion arrived on the plateau looking for the guns
as they crossed the plateau turkish machine @-@ guns opened fire on them from the lone pine area
one of thomas 's sections located the battery which had started firing from the gully
they opened fire charged the gun crews and captured the guns
the turks did manage to remove the breech blocks making the guns inoperable so the australians damaged the sights and internal screw mechanisms to put them out of action
by now the majority of the <num> and <num> battalions along with brigade commander maclagen had arrived on the plateau and he ordered them to dig in on the plateau instead of advancing to gun ridge
unfortunately the units that had already passed beyond there were obeying their orders to go as fast as you can at all costs keep going
loutit lieutenant j
haig of the <num> and thirty @-@ two men from the <num> <num> and <num> battalions crossed legge valley and climbed a spur of gun ridge just to the south of scrubby knoll
as they reached the top about four hundred yards <num> m further inland was gun ridge defended by a large number of turkish troops
loutit and two men carried out a reconnaissance of scrubby knoll from the top of which they could see the dardanelles around three miles <num>
<num> km to the east
when one of the men was wounded they returned to the rest of their group which was being engaged by turkish machine @-@ gun and rifle fire
around <num> <num> loutit sent a man back for reinforcements he located captain j
ryder of the <num> battalion with half a company of men at lone pine
ryder had not received the order to dig in so he advanced and formed a line on loutit 's right
soon after they came under fire from scrubby knoll and were in danger of being cut off ryder sent a message back for more reinforcements
the messenger located captain john peck the <num> battalion 's adjutant who collected all the men around him and went forward to reinforce ryder
it was now <num> <num> and the men on the spur outflanked by the turks had started to withdraw
at <num> <num> the turks set up a machine @-@ gun on the spur and opened fire on the withdrawing australians
pursued by the turks only eleven survivors including loutit and haig reached johnston 's jolly and took cover
further back two companies of the <num> and the <num> battalions had started digging a trench line
one <num> battalion company jackson 's landed beside the fisherman 's hut in the north and was almost wiped out only forty men survived the landing
at <num> <num> major ivie blezard 's <num> battalion company and part of another were sent onto <num> plateau by maclagen to strengthen the defence
when the <num> battalion commander lieutenant @-@ colonel harold elliott landed he realised events were not going to plan and he headed to the <num> brigade headquarters to find out what was happening
maclagen ordered him to gather his battalion at the south of the beachhead as the <num> brigade would now form the division 's right flank not left
when the <num> brigade commander colonel james mccay arrived maclagen convinced him to move his brigade to the south swapping responsibility with the <num> brigade
eventually agreeing he established his headquarters on the seaward slope of <num> plateau mccay 's hill
heading onto the plateau mccay realised the ridge to his right bolton 's ridge would be a key point in their defence
he located the brigade @-@ major walter cass and ordered him to gather what men he could to defend the ridge
looking around he saw the <num> battalion commanded by colonel william bolton moving forward so cass directed them to bolton 's ridge
as such it was the only anzac battalion that remained together during the day
eventually around <num> <num> the rest of the brigade started arriving
as each company and battalion appeared they were pushed forward into the front line but with no defined orders other than to support the <num> brigade
at <num> <num> the six guns of the <num> jacobs mountain battery arrived positioning three guns each side of white 's valley
at noon they opened fire on the turks on gun ridge
within two hours half the australian division was involved in the battle of <num> plateau
however most of the officers had misunderstood their orders
believing the intention was to occupy gun ridge and not hold their present position they still tried to advance
the <num> and <num> battalions had started forming a defence line but there was a gap between them that the <num> battalion was sent to fill
seeing the <num> brigade coming forward units of the <num> brigade started to advance to gun ridge
the advancing australians did not then know that the counter @-@ attacking turkish forces had reached the scrubby knoll area around <num> <num> and were prepared for them
as the australians reached the lone pine section of the plateau turkish machine @-@ guns and rifles opened fire decimating the australians
to the north other troops advancing beyond johnstone 's jolly and owen 's gully were caught by the same small arms fire
soon afterwards a turkish artillery battery also started firing at them
this was followed by a turkish counter @-@ attack from gun ridge
such was the situation they now found themselves in that at <num> <num> mccay now giving up all pretence of advancing to gun ridge ordered his brigade to dig in from owen 's gully to bolton 's ridge
<num> km
beyond pine ridge is legge valley and gun ridge and like the rest of the terrain it was covered in a thick gorse scrub but also had stunted pine trees around eleven feet <num>
<num> m tall growing on it
several groups of men eventually made their way to pine ridge
among the first was lieutenant eric plant 's platoon from the <num> battalion
captain john whitham 's company of the <num> battalion moved forward from bolton 's ridge when they saw the <num> battalion moving up behind them
as the <num> battalion reached the ridge the companies carried on towards gun ridge while lieutenant @-@ colonel walter mcnicoll established the battalion headquarters below bolton 's ridge
as the <num> battalion moved forward they were engaged by turkish small arms and artillery fire causing heavy casualties
at <num> <num> brigade headquarters received a message from the <num> battalion asking for reinforcement and mccay sent half the <num> battalion to assist
at the same time the <num> battalion were digging in on bolton 's except for two companies which moved forward to attack a group of turks that had come up from the south behind the <num> battalion
by noon the <num> battalion was dug in on the ridge in front of them were scattered remnants of the <num> <num> <num> and <num> battalions mostly out of view of each other in the scrub
shortly after mccay was informed that if he wanted the <num> battalion to hold its position it must be reinforced
so mccay sent his last reserves a company of the 1st battalion and ordered the <num> to leave one company on the ridge and advance on the right of the <num> battalion
the scattered formations managed to hold their positions for the remainder of the afternoon then at <num> <num> saw large numbers of turkish troops coming over the southern section of gun ridge
from the knoll kemal was able to observe the landings
he ordered the artillery battery to set up on the knoll and the 1st battalion to attack baby <num> and mortar ridge from the north @-@ east while the <num> battalion would simultaneously circle around and attack baby <num> from the west
the <num> battalion would for the moment be held in reserve
at <num> <num> kemal informed ii corps he was attacking
at <num> <num> sefik told kemal that the anzacs had a beachhead of around <num> @,@ <num> yards <num> @,@ <num> m and that he would attack towards ari burnu in conjunction with the <num> division
around midday kemal was appraised that the <num> division was fully involved with the british landings at cape helles and could not support his attack so at <num> <num> he ordered two battalions of the <num> infantry regiment the third battalion was guarding suvla bay to move forward between the <num> and <num> infantry regiments
at the same time he ordered his reserve <num> infantry regiment to move further west
within the next half @-@ hour the <num> and <num> infantry regiments started the counter @-@ attack supported by three batteries of artillery
at <num> <num> kemal met with his corps commander esat pasha and convinced him of the need to react in strength to the anzac landings
esat agreed and released the <num> and <num> infantry regiments to kemal 's command
kemal deployed the four regiments from north to south <num> <num> <num> and <num>
in total turkish strength opposing the landing numbered between ten thousand and twelve thousand men
there he joined a group from the <num> battalion commanded by lieutenant leslie morshead
lalor was killed soon afterwards
the left flank of baby <num> was now held by sixty men the remnants of several units commanded by a corporal
they had survived five charges by the turks between <num> <num> and <num> <num> after the last charge the australians were ordered to withdraw through the nek
there a company from the canterbury battalion had just arrived with their commanding officer lieutenant @-@ colonel douglas stewart
by <num> <num> the new zealand companies had formed a defence line on russell 's top
on baby <num> there was on the left morsehead 's and lalor 's men and at the top of malone 's gulley were the survivors of the <num> battalion and some men from the <num> brigade
on the right were the men left from the auckland companies and a mixed group from the 1st <num> <num> and <num> battalions
once stewart 's men were secure he ordered morsehead to withdraw
during a turkish artillery bombardment of the nek stewart was killed
the artillery heralded the start of a turkish counter @-@ attack columns of troops appeared over the top of battleship hill and on the flanks and attacked the anzac lines
at <num> <num> the three battalions from the <num> infantry regiment arrived and attacked from the north
at the same time the australians and new zealanders holding on at baby <num> broke and ran back to an improvised line from walker 's ridge in the north to pope 's hill in the south
the defence line at the nek was now defended by nine new zealanders under the command of a sergeant they had three machine @-@ guns but the crews had all been killed or wounded
as the survivors arrived from baby <num> their numbers rose to around sixty
bridges in his divisional headquarters starting receiving messages from the front just after <num> <num> lieutenant @-@ colonel george braund on walker 's ridge advised he was holding his position and if reinforced could advance
at <num> <num> maclagen reported they were being heavily attacked at <num> <num> the <num> battalion signalled <num> brigade being driven back
at <num> <num> from maclagen again <num> brigade urgently required
bridges sent two hundred stragglers from several different battalions to reinforce braund and promised two extra battalions from the new zealand and australian division which was now coming ashore
dusk was at <num> <num> and the turkish attack had now reached malone 's gulley and the nek
the new zealanders waited until the turks came close then opened fire in the darkness stopping their advance
seriously outnumbered they asked for reinforcements
instead the supporting troops to their rear were withdrawn and the turks managed to get behind them
so taking the machine @-@ guns with them they withdrew off russell 's top into rest gully
this left the defenders at walker 's ridge isolated from the rest of the force
around <num> <num> a column of turkish reinforcements from the <num> infantry regiment in at least battalion strength were observed moving along the ridge @-@ line from the south
the turks then turned towards <num> plateau and advanced in extended order
the turkish counter @-@ attack soon forced the advanced australian troops to withdraw and their machine @-@ gun fire caused them heavy casualties
it was not long before the attack had forced a wedge between the australians on baby <num> and those on <num> plateau
the heavy turkish fire onto lone pine forced the survivors to withdraw back to the western slope of <num> plateau
at <num> <num> turkish artillery and small arms fire was so heavy that the indian artillerymen were forced to push their guns back off the plateau by hand and they reformed on the beach
although in places there was a mixture of different companies and platoons dug in together the australians were deployed with the <num> battalion in the south still centred on bolton 's ridge
north of them covering the southern sector of <num> plateau were the mixed together <num> and <num> battalions both now commanded by colonel walter mcnicoll of the <num>
north of them was the <num> battalion and the <num> battalion covered the northern sector of <num> plateau at johnston 's jolly
but by now they were battalions in name only having all taken heavy casualties the commanders had little accurate knowledge of where their men were located
at <num> <num> the two battalions of the turkish <num> infantry regiment were in position and with the <num> infantry they counter @-@ attacked again
at <num> <num> and at <num> <num> mccay now under severe pressure requested reinforcements
the second time he was informed there was only one uninvolved battalion left the <num> and bridges was keeping them in reserve until more troops from the new zealand and australian division had been landed
mccay then spoke to bridges direct and informed him the situation was desperate and if not reinforced the turks would get behind him
at <num> <num> bridges released the <num> battalion to mccay who sent them to the south forming on the left of the <num> battalion along bolton 's ridge
they arrived just in time to help counter turkish probing attacks by the <num> infantry regiment from the south
at <num> <num> mccay signalled bridges that large numbers of unwounded men were leaving the battlefield and heading for the beaches
this was followed by maclagan asking for urgent artillery fire support onto gun ridge as his left was under a heavy attack and at <num> <num> owen reported the left flank was rapidly being forced to retire
at dusk maclagan made his way to bridges headquarters and when asked for his opinion replied it 's touch and go
if the turks come on in mass formation
i don 't think anything can stop them
as it got dark the turkish artillery ceased firing and although small arms fire continued on both sides the effects were limited when firing blind
darkness also provided the opportunity to start digging more substantial trenches and to resupply the troops with water and ammunition
the last significant action of the day was at <num> <num> south of lone pine when the turks charged towards bolton 's ridge
by now the <num> battalion had positioned two machine @-@ guns to cover their front which caused devastation amongst the attackers and to their left the <num> battalion also became involved
when the turks got to within fifty yards <num> m the <num> battalion counter @-@ attacked in a bayonet charge and the turks withdrew
the anzac defence was aided by royal navy searchlights providing illumination
both sides now waited for the next attack but the day 's events had shattered both formations and they were no longer in any condition to conduct offensive operations
it stretched along bolton 's ridge in the south across <num> plateau to monash valley
after a short gap it resumed at pope 's hill then at the top of walker 's ridge
it was not a large beachhead it was under two miles <num>
<num> km in length with a depth around <num> yards <num> m and in places only a few yards separated the two sides
that evening birdwood had been ashore to check on the situation and satisfied returned to hms queen
around <num> <num> he was asked to return to the beachhead
there he met with his senior officers who asked him to arrange an evacuation
unwilling to make that decision on his own he signalled hamilton both my divisional generals and brigadiers have represented to me that they fear their men are thoroughly demoralised by shrapnel fire to which they have been subjected all day after exhaustion and gallant work in morning
numbers have dribbled back from the firing line and cannot be collected in this difficult country
even new zealand brigade which has only recently been engaged lost heavily and is to some extent demoralised
if troops are subjected to shellfire again tomorrow morning there is likely to be a fiasco as i have no fresh troops with which to replace those in firing line
i know my representation is most serious but if we are to re @-@ embark it must be at once
hamilton conferred with his naval commanders who convinced him an evacuation would be almost impossible and responded dig yourselves right in and stick it out
dig dig dig until you are safe
the survivors had to fight on alone until <num> april when four battalions of the royal naval division were attached to the corps
on the turkish side by that night the <num> battalion <num> infantry were on baby <num> the <num> battalion reduced to only ninety men were at the nek and the 1st battalion on mortar ridge
just south of them was the <num> infantry next was the <num> infantry opposite <num> plateau
the last regiment the <num> infantry were on battleship hill
as for manpower the turks were in a similar situation to the anzacs
of the two regiments most heavily involved the <num> had been destroyed and the <num> were exhausted with heavy casualties
large numbers of the <num> had deserted and the regiment was in no condition to fight
the <num> was largely intact but they were a poorly trained force of arab conscripts
the iii corps having to deal with both landings could not assist as they had no reserves available
it was not until <num> april that the <num> and <num> infantry regiments arrived to reinforce the turkish forces
the anzacs however had been unable to achieve their obectives and therefore dug in
gallipoli like the western front turned into a war of attrition
the german commander liman von saunders was clear about the reasons for the outcome
he wrote that on the turkish side the situation was saved by the immediate and independent action of the <num> division
the division commander kemal became noted as the most imaginative most successful officer to fight on either side during the campaign
as a commander he was able to get the most out of his troops typified by his order to the <num> infantry regiment men i am not ordering you to attack
i am ordering you to die
in the time that it takes us to die other forces and commanders can come and take our place
in the following days there were several failed attacks and counter @-@ attacks by both sides
the turks were the first to try during the second attack on anzac cove on <num> april followed by the anzacs who tried to advance overnight <num> <num> may
the turkish third attack on anzac cove on <num> may was the worst defeat of them all with around ten thousand casualties including three thousand dead
the next four months consisted of only local or diversionary attacks until <num> august when the anzacs in connection with the landing at suvla bay attacked chunuk bair with only limited success
the turks never succeeded in driving the australians and new zealanders back into the sea
similarly the anzacs never broke out of their beachhead
instead in december <year> after eight months of fighting they evacuated the peninsula
birdwood who did not come ashore until late in the day estimated between three and four hundred dead on the beaches
the new zealand ministry for culture and heritage claims one in five of the three thousand new zealanders involved became a casualty
the australian war memorial has <num> australian dead between <num> – <num> april and the australian government estimates <num> @,@ <num> wounded left anzac cove on <num> april but more wounded were still waiting on the battlefields to be evacuated
the commonwealth war graves commission documents that <num> australian and <num> new zealand soldiers died on <num> april <year>
a higher than normal proportion of the anzac casualties were from the officer ranks
one theory was that they kept exposing themselves to fire trying to find out where they were or to locate their troops
four men were taken prisoner by the turks
it is estimated that the turkish <num> and <num> infantry regiments lost around <num> @,@ <num> men or fifty per cent of their combined strength
the full number of turkish casualties for the day has not been recorded
during the campaign <num> @,@ <num> australians and <num> @,@ <num> new zealanders were killed
the exact number of turkish dead is not known but has been estimated around <num> @,@ <num>
it does not celebrate a military victory but instead commemorates all the australians and new zealanders who served and died in all wars conflicts and peacekeeping operations and the contribution and suffering of all those who have served
around the country dawn services are held at war memorials to commemorate those involved
in australia at <num> <num> another service is held at the australian war memorial which the prime minister and governor general normally attend
the first official dawn services were held in australia in <year> and in new zealand in <year>
lower @-@ key services are also held in the united kingdom and ireland
in turkey large groups of australians and new zealanders have begun to gather at anzac cove where in <year> an estimated <num> @,@ <num> people attended the service to commemorate the landings

knopf
the story examines events in the life of alice a naïve and well @-@ intentioned squatter who moves in with a group of radicals in london and is drawn into their terrorist activities
lessing was inspired to write the good terrorist by the irish republican army ira bombing of the harrods department store in london in <year>
she had been a member of the british communist party in the early <num> but later grew disillusioned with communism
three reviewers labelled the good terrorist as a satire while lessing called it humorous
some critics called the novel 's title an oxymoron stating that it highlights alice 's ambivalent nature and that she is neither a good person nor a good revolutionary
the good terrorist divided reviewers with some being impressed by the book 's insight and characterization and others complaining about the novel 's style and the character 's lack of depth
one critic complimented lessing 's strong descriptive prose and her precise and realistic characterizations but another called the book 's text surprisingly bland and described the characters as trivial or two @-@ dimensional or crippled by self @-@ delusions
the good terrorist was shortlisted for the booker prize and won the mondello prize and the wh smith literary award
she considers herself a revolutionary fighting against fascist imperialism but is still dependent on her parents whom she treats with contempt
in the early @-@ <num> alice joins a squat of like @-@ minded comrades in a derelict house in london
accompanying her is jasper a graduate she took in at a student commune she lived in fifteen years previously
jasper became dependent on alice and followed her from squat to squat
alice fell in love with him only to become frustrated later by his aloofness and bourgeoning homosexuality
other members of the squat include bert their ineffective leader and a lesbian couple the maternal roberta and faye her unstable and fragile partner
the abandoned house is in a state of disrepair and is earmarked by the city council for demolition
to the indifference of the other comrades alice takes it upon herself to clean up and renovate the house and convinces the council that it is worth saving
she also persuades the authorities to restore the electricity and water supplies
alice becomes the house 's mother cooking for everyone and dealing with the local police who are trying to evict them
the members of the squat belong to the communist centre union ccu and attend demonstrations and pickets
alice involves herself in some of these activities but spends most of her time working on the house
to be more useful to the struggle jasper and bert travel to ireland to persuade the irish republican army ira to let the ccu join them but they are rejected
they also take a trip to the soviet union to offer their services but are turned down
the ira and kgb however have begun taking notice of them and start using the house as a conduit for propaganda material and guns
packages start arriving in the middle of the night and alice to avoid attracting the attention of the police raises objections
this results in visits to the house by strangers who question the squat 's decision making
after this the comrades decide to ignore orders to act on their own and to consider themselves freeborn british communists
going it alone now they start experimenting with explosives and build a car bomb
alice does not fully support this action but accepts the majority decision
they target an upmarket hotel in knightsbridge but their inexperience results in the premature detonation of the bomb which kills faye and several passers @-@ by
the remaining comrades shaken by what they have done decide to leave the squat and go their own way
alice disillusioned by jasper chooses not to follow him and remains behind because she cannot bear to abandon the house she has put so much effort into
despite her initial reservations about the bombing alice feels a need to justify their actions to others but realises it would be fruitless because o rdinary people simply didn 't understand
she acknowledges that she is a terrorist now though she cannot remember when the change happened
she was attracted to a group of quasi @-@ communist s and joined their left book club in salisbury now harare
later prompted by the conflicts arising from racial segregation prominent in rhodesia at the time she also joined the southern rhodesian labour party
lessing moved to london in <year> and began her writing career there
she became a member of the british communist party in the early <num> and was an active campaigner against the use of nuclear weapons
by <year> lessing had published six novels but grew disillusioned with communism and after reading the sufis by idries shah turned her attention to sufism an islamic belief system
this prompted her to write her five @-@ volume space fiction series canopus in argos archives which drew on sufi concepts
the series was not well received by some of her readers who felt she had abandoned her rational worldview
the good terrorist was lessing 's first book to be published after the canopus in argos series which prompted several retorts from reviewers including lessing has returned to earth and lessing returns to reality
several commentators have labelled the good terrorist as a satire while lessing called it humorous
she said i t 's not a book with a political statement
it 's
about a certain kind of political person a kind of self @-@ styled revolutionary that can only be produced by affluent societies
there 's a great deal of playacting that i don 't think you 'd find in extreme left revolutionaries in societies where they have an immediate challenge
lessing said she was inspired to write the good terrorist by the ira bombing of the harrods department store in london in <year>
she recalled the media reported it to sound as if it was the work of amateurs
i started to think what kind of amateurs could they be and realised how easy it would be for a kid not really knowing what he or she was doing to drift into a terrorist group
lessing already had alice in mind as the central character i know several people like alice — this mixture of
maternal caring
and who can contemplate killing large numbers of people without a moment 's bother
she described alice as quietly comic al because she is so full of contradictions
she said she was surprised how some of the characters other than jasper alice 's love interest developed such as the pill @-@ popping and fragile faye who turned out to be a destroyed person
lurie stated that as political fiction it is one of the best novels
about the terrorist mentality since joseph conrad 's the secret agent <year> although this was questioned by william h
pritchard in the hudson review who wrote that compared to conrad the good terrorist is shapeless
several commentators have pointed out that it is more a novel about politics than political fiction
in from the margins of empire christina stead doris lessing nadine gordimer louise yelin called the work a novel about politics rather than a political novel per se
the good terrorist has also been called a satire
in her book doris lessing the poetics of change gayle greene called it a satire of a group of revolutionaries and susan watkins writing in doris lessing border crossings described it as a dry and satirical examination of a woman 's involvement with a left @-@ wing splinter group
a biography of lessing for the swedish academy on the occasion of her winning the <year> nobel prize in literature described the book as a satirical picture of the need of the contemporary left for total control and the female protagonist 's misdirected martyrdom and subjugation
yelin said the novel oscillat ed between satire and nostalgia
academic robert e
kuehn felt that it is not satire at all
he stated while the book could have been a satire of the blackest and most hilarious kind in his opinion lessing has no sense of humor and instead of lashing the characters with the satirist 's whip she treats them with unremitting and belittling irony
virginia scott called the novel a fantasy
drawing on lewis carroll 's alice 's adventures in wonderland in the international fiction review she wrote that lessing 's alice with her group of political revolutionaries can be seen as a serious fantasy which has striking parallels to
carroll 's alice
both alices enter a house and are confronted by seemingly impossible challenges carroll 's alice has to navigate passages too small to fit through while lessing 's alice finds herself in a barely inhabitable house that is earmarked for demolition
both alices are able to change their appearances in wonderland alice adjusts her size to suit her needs in the good terrorist alice changes her demeanour to get what she wants from others
scott noted that at one point in the good terrorist faye refers to alice as alice the wonder the wondrous alice alluding to carroll 's alice
this theme suggests that problems occur when we are coerced into conforming
freeman said that alice is a quintessential good woman
the little hausefrau revolutionary but turns bad under peer pressure
another theme present is the symbolic nature of the house
margaret scanlan stated that as in books like mansfield park and jane eyre the good terrorist defines a woman in terms of her house
writing in the journal studies in the novel katherine fishburn said that lessing often uses a house to symbolise psychological or ontological change and that here the house
symbolizes alice 's function in the story
yelin described the good terrorist as an urban dystopian updating of the house @-@ as @-@ england genre where
england is represented by a house in london
writing in politics of feminine abuse political oppression and masculine obstinacy in doris lessing 's the good terrorist lalbakhsh and yahya suggest that the house and the oppressive relations in it reflect the similarly oppressive relationships in the society it resides in
several critics have focused on the theme of motherhood
in mothers and daughters aging and dying claire sprague wrote that lessing often dwells on the theme of mothers passing their behaviours onto their daughters and how the cycle of daughters fighting their mothers permeates each generation
the british novelist jane rogers said that the good terrorist is as unsparing and incisive about motherhood as it is about the extreme left
she stated that motherhood here is terrible alice 's mother is reduced to despair continually yielding to her selfish daughter 's demands alice mothers jasper and has a similar despairing relationship with him
rogers added that motherhood is depicted here as a compulsion to protect the weak despite their propensity to retaliate and hurt you
feminist themes and the subjugation of women have also been associated with the good terrorist
scanlan indicated that while many of the comrades in the book are women they find that political activity does not elevate their position and that they are trapped in the patriarchy they despise
yelin suggested that although lessing ridicules the male members of the ccu and their role playing she is also critical of the female members who collude in male @-@ dominant political organizations and thus in their own oppression
but with the book 's allusions to jasper 's homosexuality yelin added that lessing 's critique of women 's infatuation with patriarchal misogyny and their emotional dependence on misogynist men is muted by homophobia and the misogyny pervasive in patriarchal constructions of male heterosexuality
lalbakhsh and yahya noted that lessing depicts alice as a typical housewife who cares for her family in this case the squat but is ignored and neglected
they concluded that alice 's fate is sealed because according to the british socialist feminist juliet mitchell women are fundamental to the human condition yet their economic social and political roles
are marginal
robert boschman suggested it is indicative of alice 's contradictory personality that she renovates the squat 's house yet is bent on destroying society
in the hudson review george kearns wrote that the title hovers above the novel with
irony
the reader assumes that alice is the good terrorist but that while she may be a good person she is rotten at being a terrorist
writing in world literature today mona knapp concluded that lessing 's heroine the good terrorist is neither a good person nor a good revolutionary
she knows how to renovate houses and manipulate people to her advantage but she is unemployed and steals money from her parents
when real revolutionaries start using the squat to ship arms she panics and going behind her comrades backs she makes a telephone call to the authorities to warn them
knapp called alice a bad terrorist and a stunted human being
fishburn suggested that it is lessing herself who is the good terrorist symbolised here by alice but that hers is political terrorism of a literary kind where she frequently disguises her ideas in very domestic @-@ looking fiction and direct ly challenge s
our sense of reality
kuehn described alice as well @-@ intentioned canny and sometimes lovable but as someone who at <num> never grew up and is still dependent on her parents
yelin said alice is in a state of perpetual adolescence and her need to mother everyone is an extreme case of psychological regression or failure to thrive
greene wrote that alice 's humanitarianism is ludicrous in her world and described her as so furiously at odds with herself because she is too immature to comprehend what is happening and her actions vary from being helpful to dangerous
boschman called lessing 's narrative ironic because it highlights the divide between who alice is and who she thinks she is and her efforts to pretend there is no discrepancy
alice refuses to acknowledge that her maternal activities stem from her desire to win her mother 's approval and believing that her mother has betrayed and abandoned her alice turns to jasper as a way to continue to sustain her beliefs about herself and the world
even though jasper takes advantage of her adoration of him by mistreating her alice still clings to him because her self @-@ image vigorously qualifies her perception of him and thus proliferates the denial and self @-@ deception
the fact that jasper has turned to homosexuality which alice dismisses as his emotional life suits her own repressed desires
kuehn called alice 's obsession with the hapless and repellent jasper just comprehensible adding that she feels safe with his gayness even though she has to endure his abuse
knapp stated that while lessing exposes self @-@ styled insurrectionists as spoiled and immature products of the middle class she also derides their ineptness at affecting any meaningful change
lessing is critical of the state which feeds the very hand that terrorizes it yet she also condemns those institutions that exploits the working class and ignores the homeless
knapp remarks that lessing does not resolve these ambiguities but instead highlights the failings of the state and those seeking to overthrow it
scanlan compared lessing 's comrades to richard e
rubenstein 's terrorists in his book alchemists of revolution terrorism in the modern world
rubenstein wrote that when ambitious idealists have no creative ruling class to follow or a rebellious lower class to lead they have often taken upon themselves the burden of representative action which he said is a formula for disaster
elizabeth lowry highlighted this in the london review of books lessing has been sharply criticised for the pedestrian quality of her prose and as vigorously defended
the irish literary critic denis donoghue complained that the style of the novel is insistently drab and kuehn referred to lessing 's text as surprisingly bland
lowry noted that the english academic clare hanson defended the book by saying that it is a grey and textureless novel because it
speaks a grey and textureless language
freeman on the other hand called the book a graceful and accomplished story and a brilliant account of the types of individuals who commit terrorist acts
writing in the los angeles times freeman described lessing as one of our most valuable writers who has an uncanny grasp of human relationships
in a review in the sun @-@ sentinel bonnie gross described the novel as rewarding reading and lessing 's most accessible book to date
she said it is the author 's strong descriptive prose and her precise and realistic characterizations that makes this book remarkable
gross felt that while some of the male characters are not that strong the female characters are much better developed particularly alice whom she found memorable
amanda sebestyen wrote in the women 's review of books that at first glance the ideas in the good terrorist appear deceptively simple and the plot predictable
but she added that lessing 's strength is her stoic narrat ion of the daily effort of living which excels in the way she describes day @-@ to @-@ day life in a squat
sebestyen also liked the book 's depiction of alice who speak s to me most disquietingly about myself and my generation
in a review in off our backs an american feminist publication vickie leonard called the good terrorist a fascinating book that is extremely well written with characters that are exciting and realistic
leonard added that even though alice is not a feminist the book illustrates the author 's strong admiration for women and their accomplishments
writing in the guardian rogers described the good terrorist as a novel in unsparing close @-@ up that examines society through the eyes of individuals
she said it is witty and
angry at human stupidity and destructiveness and within the context of recent terrorist attacks in london it is an example of fiction going where factual writing cannot
a critic in kirkus reviews wrote that alice 's story is an extraordinary tour de force — a psychological portrait that 's realistic with a vengeance
the reviewer added that although alice is self @-@ deluding and not always likeable the novel 's strength are the characters and its depiction of political motivation
donoghue wrote in the new york times that he did not care much about what happened to alice and her comrades
he felt that lessing presents alice as an unquestioned rigmarole of reactions and prejudices which leaves no room for any further interest
donoghue complained that lessing has not made up her mind on whether her characters are the salt of the earth or its scum
in a review in the chicago tribune kuehn felt that the work has little impact and is not memorable
he said lessing 's real interest is character development but complained that the characters are trivial or two @-@ dimensional or crippled by self @-@ delusions
the good terrorist was shortlisted for the <year> booker prize and in <year> won the mondello prize and the wh smith literary award
in <year> lessing was awarded the nobel prize in literature for being part of both the history of literature and living literature
in the award ceremony speech by swedish writer per wästberg the good terrorist was cited as an in @-@ depth account of the extreme leftwing squatting culture that sponges off female self @-@ sacrifice
following lessing 's death in <year> the guardian put the good terrorist in their list of the top five lessing books
indian writer neel mukherjee included the novel in his <year> top <num> books about revolutionaries also published in the guardian

<num> – <num> march <num> also earl of derby was a member of the english nobility in the <num> century and a prominent english diplomat politician and soldier
the son and heir of henry <num> earl of lancaster and maud chaworth he became one of edward iii 's most trusted captains in the early phases of the hundred years war and distinguished himself with victory in the battle of auberoche
he was a founding member and the second knight of the order of the garter in <num> and in <num> was created duke
grosmont was also the author of the book livre de seyntz medicines a highly personal devotional treatise
he is remembered as one of the founders and early patrons of corpus christi college cambridge which was established by two of the guilds of the town in <num>
through his inheritance and a fortunate marriage thomas became the wealthiest peer in england but constant quarrels with king edward ii led to his execution in <num>
having no heir thomas 's possessions and titles went to his younger brother henry – grosmont 's father
earl henry of lancaster assented to the deposition of edward ii in <num> but did not long stay in favour with the regency of queen isabella and roger mortimer
when edward iii took personal control of the government in <num> relations with the crown improved but by this time the older henry was already struggling with poor health and blindness
little is known of grosmont 's early years but that he was born at grosmont castle in grosmont monmouthshire wales and that he was born c
<num> not around the turn of the century as previously held
according to his own memoirs he was better at martial arts than at academic subjects and did not learn to read until later in life
in <num> he was knighted and represented his father in parliament
the next year he is recorded as participating in a royal tournament at cheapside
in <num> he took part in edward 's scottish campaign though it is unclear whether he was present at the great english victory at the battle of halidon hill
after further service in the north he was appointed the king 's lieutenant in scotland in <num>
the next year he was one of the six men edward iii promoted to the higher levels of the peerage
one of his father 's lesser titles that of earl of derby was bestowed upon grosmont
he took part in several diplomatic missions and minor campaigns and was present at the great english victory in the naval battle of sluys in <num>
later the same year he was required to commit himself as hostage in the low countries for the king 's considerable debts
he remained hostage until the next year and had to pay a large ransom for his own release
on his return he was made the king 's lieutenant in the north and stayed at roxburgh until <num>
the next years he spent in diplomatic negotiations in the low countries castile and avignon
in <num> edward iii was planning a major assault on france
a three @-@ pronged attack would have the earl of northampton attacking from brittany the king himself from flanders while grosmont was dispatched to aquitaine to prepare a campaign in the south
moving rapidly through the country he confronted the comte d ’ isle at auberoche on <num> october and there achieved a victory described as the greatest single achievement of lancaster 's entire military career
the ransom from the prisoners has been estimated at £ <num> @,@ <num>
the next year while edward was carrying out his crécy campaign grosmont laid siege to and captured poitiers before returning home to england in <num>
the younger henry was now earl of lancaster – the wealthiest and most powerful peer of the realm
after participating in the siege of calais in <num> the king honoured lancaster by including him as a founding knight of the order of the garter in <num>
a few years later in <num> edward bestowed an even greater honour on lancaster when he created him duke of lancaster
the title of duke was of relatively new origin in england only one other ducal title existed previously
in addition to this lancaster was given palatinate status for the county of lancashire which entailed a separate administration independent of the crown
this grant was quite exceptional in english history only two other counties palatine existed durham which was an ancient ecclesiastical palatinate and chester which was crown property
it is a sign of edward 's high regard for lancaster that he would bestow such extensive privileges on him
the two men were second cousins through their great @-@ grandfather henry iii and practically coeval edward was born in <num> so it is natural to assume that a strong sense of camaraderie existed between them
another factor that might have influenced the king 's decision was the fact that henry had no male heir so the grant was made for the earl 's lifetime only and not intended to be hereditary
in <num> he was present at the naval victory at winchelsea where he allegedly saved the lives of the black prince and john of gaunt
the years <num> @-@ <num> he spent on crusade in prussia
it was here that a quarrel with otto duke of brunswick almost led to a duel between the two men narrowly averted by the intervention of the french king john ii
in the later half of the decade campaigning in france resumed
after a chevauchée in normandy in <num> and the siege of rennes in <num> lancaster participated in the last great offensive of the first phase of the hundred years war the rheims campaign of <num> @-@ <num>
then he was appointed principal negotiator for the treaty of brétigny where the english achieved very favourable terms
after returning to england in november <num> he fell ill early the next year and died at leicester castle on <num> march
it is likely that the cause of death was the plague which that year was making a second visitation of england
he was buried in the church of the annunciation of our lady of the newarke leicester the church which he had built within the religious and charitable institution founded by his father next to leicester castle and where he had re @-@ buried his father some years previously
the two had no sons but two daughters maud and blanche
while maud was married to william i duke of bavaria blanche married edward iii 's son john of gaunt
gaunt ended up inheriting lancaster 's possessions and ducal title but it was not until <num> when the dying king edward iii was largely incapacitated that he was able to restore the palatinate rights for the county of lancaster
when gaunt 's son henry of bolingbroke usurped the crown in <num> and became henry iv the vast lancaster inheritance including the lordship of bowland was merged with the crown as the duchy of lancaster
we know more about lancaster 's character than of most of his contemporaries through his memoirs the livre de seyntz medicines book of the holy doctors
this book is a highly personal treatise on matters of religion and piety but it also contains details of historical interest
it among other things revealed that lancaster at the age of <num> when he wrote the book in <num> suffered from gout
the book is primarily a devotional work though it is organized around seven wounds which henry claims to have representing the seven sins

<num> out of <num> and amy reiter of the los angeles times said she felt vaguely underwhelmed and that the episode lacked emotional resonance
in contrast the a
v
club 's todd vanderwerff gave the episode a b and called it a marked improvement over the season premiere and complimented the way it gave nearly all of the storylines an emotional core
anthony benigno of the faster times characterized it as one of the tightest best @-@ made most well @-@ acted and entertaining hours from glee in a very long time and buddytv 's john kubicek said that it was quintessential glee and that the show is once again a magical fabulous unicorn
bobby hankinson of the houston chronicle was charmed moved and excited for what 's to come
the reappearance of storylines left dangling at the end of the first season was noted with approval by samantha urban of the dallas morning news and vanderwerff who both mentioned not only the big one about quinn and puck and baby beth but also artie 's love of directing and variously added rachel and shelby and movement on the will and emma relationship
the fact that shelby had been hired to form a second glee club at mckinley however was greeted with derision by both reviewers — urban called it mind @-@ bogglingly idiotic — and others as well
reiter found the idea incomprehensible and vanity fair 's brett berk wrote given will 's ongoing struggles to fill his own crooning baker 's dozen this is about as realistic a plan as michele bachmann starting a rival chapter of pflag at liberty university
vicki hyman of the star @-@ ledger characterized the notion of shelby deciding to give up a burgeoning broadway career because she was missing her daughter grow up to take a part @-@ time job in lima as ridiculous and the whole scenario as more than a little bizarre
the effect of shelby 's advent on puck evoked the most praise
benigno called the segment where puck meets beth the best scene of this very young season the hollywood reporter 's lesley goldberg said it was a top moment and abby west of entertainment weekly dubbed it the sweetest scene of the night
vanderwerff also called it very sweet and expressed hope that the show will come up with something for him to do after mostly relegating him to weird comic relief last season
the effect of her return on quinn was greeted with less enthusiasm
reiter was not thrilled by the possibility of a custody battle between quinn and shelby and called quinn 's plan half @-@ baked and canning dismissed it as clichéd drama
kubicek expressed interest in seeing where this goes and vanderwerff noted that quinn has been grieving giving up her child all this time and she didn 't even know it and characterized it as a fairly powerful storyline
critics were divided on kurt 's storyline as he faced being perceived primarily as gay both when auditioning and when running for class president
vanderwerff said it was the most consistent storyline and canning called it the most familiar story but also described kurt as by far the most interesting and most layered character his stories delivering the most emotional connections and this episode 's installments entertaining territory
kubicek stated that there were tons of wonderful kurt moments in the episode
benigno called kurt learning to embrace his gayness yet again on the show kind of awkward and hyman asked was this kurt accepts he 's special <num>
<num> or <num>
<num> i can 't keep track
votta summed up kurt 's audition quandary kurt is fighting typecasting and while the ninjitsu fingerless gloves and climbing routine might have been an attempt to butch it up instead kurt played right into expectations with the over @-@ the @-@ top funny girl piece
his attempt to rescue the situation by reauditioning via performing a romeo and juliet scene with rachel evoked laughter from the three directors and rachel herself but as votta points out kurt was not actually being bad as romeo
jayma mays who plays emma one of the directors in that scene stated in an interview that she thought kurt was good
kurt finding himself in competition with blaine was also touched on but several reviewers were unhappy with the revelation that blaine was not a senior like kurt as had been implied in the previous season
vanderwerff wrote that blaine seems to have simultaneously gotten younger and had a complete personality transplant over the summer votta noted the continuity @-@ bending plot point that he 's somehow a junior and not a senior like his boyfriend and urban allowed her exasperation to show oh really glee blaine 's a junior blaine 's younger than kurt fine
fine
mtv 's jim cantiello went into rhyme to express his dismay it 's hard to keep my bearings straight and oh how it makes my heart ache kurt and blaine were gonna move to new york together but now they 'll have to wait referring to a scene in the new york episode where kurt discussed the planned move with rachel
goldberg was pleased that having brittany volunteer to run kurt 's campaign included an acknowledgment that he went through hell the previous year and praised brittany logic in general
respers france loved that brittany in helping kurt find his magical inner unicorn was able to find her own
reiter enjoyed the delicious dose of brittany @-@ isms which she called the best part of the episode and kubicek said that there were tons of wonderful brittany moments
for hyman the one sit @-@ up @-@ and @-@ take @-@ notice moment was the confrontation between will and quinn where he told her to grow up
respers france thought sue sylvester 's attempt to use quinn against the glee club was hilarious but vanderwerff was unhappy with quinn being coopted into sue ’ s ridiculous run for congress
reiter wrote that it was hard to muster much sympathy for quinn in the episode given the scene with quinn and the skanks flushing someone 's head in a public toilet threatening to cut them and shaking them down for their lunch money are orders of magnitude more chilling than the face @-@ full @-@ of @-@ slushy bullying we 're used to seeing
all three were broadway songs two from west side story and one from funny girl — the concentration on show tunes disappointed reiter and canning felt they were all too bland but others were happy with the selections including hankinson who said he was loving the broadway @-@ bend to these first two episodes and added all three of tonight 's numbers were hands @-@ down fantastic
the duet of somewhere featuring rachel and shelby was generally complimented
both benigno and rae votta of billboard compared it favorably to their previous duet lady gaga 's poker face from season one
benigno gave the performance a b while michael slezak of tvline gave it an a − and praised their powerful evocative voices
rolling stone 's erica futterman was not impressed and characterized it as lite fm snooze that does nothing to showcase these broadway belters in a new and exciting way
amy lee of the huffington post called it pretty bland and said it was getting annoying that rachel sings every song as if she 's barbra streisand
the wall street journal 's raymund flandez however called the duet pitch @-@ perfect and so sublime it makes you catch your breath
kurt 's choice of i 'm the greatest star to audition for the role of tony — the one song not from west side story — drew comment benigno ascribed it to kurt 's ability to make a talented ass of himself while slezak was of the opinion that kurt was way too savvy and way too hungry for the role for that kind of misstep
despite these plot @-@ related issues both reviewers gave the performance an a and benigno noted both that he nails it and last half of the song is a singing clinic
vanderwerff was not fond of the reliance on gimmicky staging though futterman called it an impressive physical performance votta stated that kurt sounds flawless and the performance is captivating and flandez complimented his captivating high notes after high notes and added he 's a star unicorn and he knows it
lisa respers france of cnn wrote that kurt was amazing singing streisand and for the first time i realized that he really is as big a star as rachel
blaine 's rendition of something 's coming was the most enthusiastically welcomed
it was the favorite number of lee vanderwerff and futterman lee said it was the best song and added he 's kinetic impassioned and generally delightful as blaine @-@ playing @-@ tony
vanderwerff was even more complimentary with by far the best performance and futterman called it the winning musical number of the episode
both slezak and benigno gave it a b and the former complimented criss 's breathless charm and boyish enthusiasm while the latter maintained that the actor is at his best when he 's doing goofy pop numbers with kind of an off @-@ beat twist
west gave the song an a − and said blaine just knows how to own the stage and your tv screen while both votta and respers france wrote that he was the perfect tony
the duet version of somewhere appeared at number seventy @-@ five the fourth time the song charted in the hot <num>
by contrast something 's coming the episode 's other song from west side story has never appeared in the hot <num> and failed to chart there again

<num> million household viewers which marked a continued recent improvement in ratings for the series

the episode received generally positive reviews
she asks her mother marlene pamela reed to tell the story about how she fell in love with a lifeguard that saved her from drowning in <year> but the two had to break it off over objections from marlene 's parents
leslie later tells the story to justin justin theroux who is amazed by the tale and wants to unite the two
he successfully tracks down marlene 's old flame frank beckerson john larroquette and convinces leslie to go with him to illinois and reunite the two on valentine 's day at the senior center valentine 's dance which the parks department oversees
leslie and justin meet frank a strange and depressed man that has constant panic attacks
leslie begins to have doubts about bringing him to her mother and tries to call it off but justin insists that they should let this unfold
at the dance where andy 's chris pratt band mouse rat is playing frank meets up with marlene who is repulsed by frank 's past current unemployment and overall failure at life
she turns down his offer at a second chance at love prompting him to storm onto the stage and denounce her over the microphone
leslie apologizes to her mother for bringing frank
she is later upset with justin but has trouble pinpointing the reasons for her dissatisfaction
ron nick offerman explains that justin is a tourist meaning that he takes vacations in people 's lives and only cares about telling interesting stories to impress other people which makes him selfish
two older women then recognize ron as jazz saxophonist duke silver but he denies it
leslie later breaks up with justin which tom aziz ansari takes especially hard reacting as if his parents were getting divorced
before the senior dance tom invites his ex @-@ wife wendy jama williamson to his office to finally disclose his romantic feelings for her but she rejects him
not satisfied with the outcome he attempts to blackmail her into a date using an alimony lawsuit as leverage
tom and wendy are later shown hugging and presumably making amends although their conversation remains inaudible
meanwhile april 's aubrey plaza boyfriend derek blake lee and his boyfriend ben josh duvendeck mock the senior citizens causing april to question why their interactions must constantly be cloaked in like <num> layers of irony
they accuse her of lameness which they attribute to spending time with andy and provide her with several ultimatums
she breaks up with them in response
ann rashida jones and mark paul schneider at the same time celebrate their first valentine 's day together
in an interview with the camera crew ann describes the relationship as good but her tone of voice and body language around mark contradict her statements
she later becomes jealous when andy dedicates a song to april even going so far as to question april about the possibility of a budding relationship between april and andy to which april responds impatiently
the episode featured a guest appearance by john larroquette as frank beckerson the long @-@ lost love of leslie 's mother marlene knope
when parks and recreation co @-@ creator greg daniels announced the casting in january <year> he described larroquette 's character as he 's the one who got away
galentine 's day also included an appearance by pamela reed who has played marlene knope in several episodes and the last of a string of slated guest appearances by justin theroux as justin anderson a love interest for leslie
the episode marked the return of andy 's band mouse rat which was previously featured in the first season finale rock show
his bandmates are played by mark rivers drums andrew burlinson guitar and alan yang bass the latter of whom serves as a screenwriter for parks and recreation
this is a reference to the previous second season episode practice date which establishes ron 's secret identity as a jazz musician
leslie referred to her galentine 's day breakfast tradition as lilith fair minus the angst and plus frittatas a reference to the concert tour and traveling music festival
she also said the love story between marlene and frank makes the <year> romance film the notebook look like the <year> horror film saw v
mark gets ann a necklace similar to the heart of the ocean the fictional jewelry given to kate winslet 's character in the <year> romantic drama film titanic
during one scene in galentine 's day leslie does a voice impersonation of u
s
president john f
kennedy
when tom mistakes the impression for that of the arnold schwarzenegger character terminator he prompts leslie to do that impression as well
among the songs performed by mouse rat in galentine 's day were the way you look tonight originally performed by fred astaire in the <year> film swing time
andy 's bandmate suggests he sings the let 's call the whole thing off more like jazz musician and trumpeter louis armstrong who andy admits he has never heard of
andy and his band also performs i only have eyes for you and i 've got you under my skin
leslie said reuniting marlene and frank would be like reuniting romeo and juliet the protagonists of the william shakespeare play of the same name or reuniting actress jennifer aniston and actor brad pitt
she also warns to the camera for aniston to stay away from john mayer the musician who previously dated aniston
in the days prior to the original broadcast of galentine 's day mayer publicly apologized for a number of explicit sexual and racial comments he had made in the past months which prompted news outlets to praise parks and recreation for the timeliness of their mayer joke
ironically in may <year> jennifer aniston started dating justin theroux who guest starred in the episode and they later married
frank made a reference to a recurring gag from arrested development when after being rejected he announced to marlene take one last look
because you 'll never see this body again

galentine 's day received generally positive reviews
entertainment weekly writer sandra gonzalez said the show managed to cram more character development into <num> minutes than i thought possible
almost every couple had a major milestone of sorts last night
gonzalez complimented the acting of aziz ansari during his moments with wendy and praised the touching moment between ron and leslie when she realized she had to break up with justin
steve kandell of new york magazine appreciated that leslie was correct about frank and that justin was the ignorant one
kandell said the senior dance served as a poignant backdrop for the episode 's romantic subplots but said the most intriguing show 's relationship is between leslie and ron
alan sepinwall television columnist with the star @-@ ledger said the episode was funny but focused more attention on advancing various romantic subplots
sepinwall said the scenes about ann and mark were a nice reaction to the general blandness of that relationship but found it frustrating that the episode left the reason for wendy and tom 's resolution unclear in galentine 's day
steve heisler of the a
v
club praised the episode for displaying some of leslie 's stronger and more competent aspects which he said makes audiences much more willing to put up with her many many eccentricities
heisler said he thought the leslie and justin relationship ended appropriately and praised ansari 's performance but added he was a little taken aback by how rudely tom treated wendy
matt fowler of ign said the episode had many funny moments and good character development but he said some of the romantic relationships risked skewing the balance between the sweet and the absurd and that some of the character moments played out a bit too jarringly real for a show like this
kona gallagher of tv squad said she would like to see leslie get a boyfriend who last longer than three episodes unlike justin theroux and louis c
k
who played leslie 's love interest dave sanderson earlier in the season
gallagher praised andy 's band and the befuddlement with which andy reacted to the senior citizen audience
mike murphy of the press democrat said the episode was funny and he particularly praised the hilariously whacked @-@ out performance of john laroquette
several commentators praised the joke about andy 's new rock song sex hair about how one can tell whether someone had sex because their hair is matted
the dvd included deleted scenes for each episode
the song was written and produced by shaffer smith known by his stage name ne @-@ yo while additional writing and production was done by stargate members mikkel storleer eriksen and tor erik hermansen
after leaking online in the beginning of may <year> universal motown officially released the song to media outlets while its digital single was released on may <num> <year>
the song is influenced by electropop and dance @-@ pop
lyrically it is about a woman being strong enough to get what she wants when she wants it
critically bossy attained generally mixed reception upon release many music critics generally praised the attitude of the song but considered the song less catchy than lohan 's previous efforts
commercially bossy managed to peak at number <num> on the canadian hot <num> and became lohan 's first song from her entire music career so far to reach number one on the united states billboard hot dance club play
in the beginning of may <year> a clip of the song leaked on youtube
as a result universal motown released the full song to media outlets on may <num> <year>
in an interview with billboard ne @-@ yo revealed that he was approached by the label to write a song for lohan i gotta admit we were like
lindsay lohan i mean i 've written for beyoncé mary j
blige rihanna celine dion and
lindsay lohan but i will say this we gave her a quality record and she did a ridiculously fabulous job
i was so shocked i had to call her and apologize for what i was thinking because she did so good
i think the world is gonna be surprised
in an interview with people magazine he revealed the song it 's basically about a woman being strong enough to get what she wants when she wants it
in this case bossy is a term that describes confidence and power
bossy was digitally released on may <num> <year> and it was set to appear on lohan 's third studio album
a billboard review said the track spotlights the raspy @-@ voiced singer 's dominating side as she rhymes about liking things her way over simple drums while nick levine of digital spy considered bossy as an electro @-@ dance @-@ pop song with attitude but commented that it isn 't pop gold – the chorus lacks a bit of oomph and lohan 's vocals still aren 't convincing – but it 's the first lohan tune we 'd be prepared to listen to more than once
that we suppose is enough to constitute a small step forward
kate brandli of blogcritics said bossy is not nearly as good or as catchy as miss lohan 's previous musical attempts while commenting that its lyrical content is an obvious reflection on miss lohan 's relationship with the paparazzi
as miss lohan sings in the lyrics she does what she wants she controls them and not vice versa
unfortunately miss lohan 's logic is not entirely correct — neither party has the authority to boss the other around
that is sadly the price of fame these days — once people want in they want total access and exposure
with some individual 's antics like miss lohan and britney spears it is difficult to garner sympathy for them
bossy reached number <num> on the canadian hot <num> and became lohan 's first song from her entire career to reach number one on the united states billboard hot dance club play
the song also managed to peak on the global dance tracks component chart
they are said to have been joined at both the shoulder and the hip and to have lived for <num> years
it is claimed that on their death they bequeathed five plots of land to the village known as the bread and cheese lands
the income from these lands was used to pay for an annual dole of food and drink to the poor every easter
since at least <year> the dole has included biddenden cakes hard biscuits imprinted with an image of two conjoined women
although the annual distribution of food and drink is known to have taken place since at least <year> no records exist of the story of the sisters prior to <year>
records of that time say that the names of the sisters were not known and early drawings of biddenden cakes do not give names for the sisters it is not until the early <num> century that the names mary and eliza chulkhurst were first used
edward hasted the local historian of kent has dismissed the story of the biddenden maids as a folk myth claiming that the image on the cake had originally represented two poor women and that the story of the conjoined twins was a vulgar tradition invented to account for it while influential historian robert chambers accepted that the legend could be true but believed it unlikely
throughout most of the <num> century little research was carried out into the origins of the legend
despite the doubts among historians in the <num> century the legend became increasingly popular and the village of biddenden was thronged with rowdy visitors every easter
in the late <num> century historians investigated the origins of the legend
it was suggested that the twins had genuinely existed but had been joined at the hip only rather than at both the hip and shoulder and that they had lived in the <num> rather than the <num> century
in <year> the bread and cheese lands were sold for housing and the resulting income allowed the annual dole to expand considerably providing the widows and pensioners of biddenden with cheese bread and tea at easter and with cash payments at christmas
biddenden cakes continue to be given to the poor of biddenden each easter and are sold as souvenirs to visitors
the pair were said to be conjoined at both the shoulder and the hip
they grew up conjoined and are said to have had frequent quarrels which sometimes terminated in blows
at the age of <num> mary chulkhurst died suddenly
doctors proposed to separate the still @-@ living eliza from her sister 's body but she refused saying as we came together we will also go together and died six hours afterwards
in their wills the sisters left five pieces of land in the biddenden area comprising around <num> acres <num> ha in total to the local church with the income from these lands claimed to have been <num> guineas per annum at the time of their death to provide an annual dole of bread cheese and beer to the poor every easter
henceforward the lands were to be known as the bread and cheese lands
it is recorded that in <year> the custom that on that day easter our parson giveth unto the parishoners bread cheese cakes and divers barrels of beer brought in there and drawn was suspended on account of a visit from charles fotherby the archdeacon of canterbury owing to previous ceremonies having caused much disorder by reason of some unruly ones which at such time we cannot restrain with any ease
in <year> rector william horner claimed that the bread and cheese lands were glebe land intended for the use of the parish priest and attempted to take control of the lands
the case of the bread and cheese lands was brought before the committee for plundered ministers who eventually found in favour of the charity in <year>
horner brought the case before the court of the exchequer in <year> but again without success and the charity continued to own the lands and to operate the annual easter dole
witness statements from these cases mention that the lands had been given by two women who grew together in their bodies but do not give any name for the women
in <year> the disorder and indecency of the annual dole led to the threat of intervention by the archbishop of canterbury
the distribution of the dole ceased to be conducted inside the church it was moved to the church porch
by <year> it is recorded that the annual dole took place immediately after the afternoon easter service
the annual income from the bread and cheese lands had risen to <num> guineas about £ <num> @,@ <num> in <year> and a huge quantity of food was distributed each year
by this time as well as the dole of bread cheese and beer hard bread rolls known as biddenden cakes moulded into an image of the sisters were thrown to crowds from the church roof
the biddenden cakes were flat hard and made of flour and water and were described as not by any means tempting one writer in <year> described one as a biscuit plaque
this account states that the twins were joined at the hip only rather than at both the hip and the shoulder and that they lived to a relatively old age
the article explicitly states that their names were not recorded and that they were known only as the maids of biddenden
the anonymous author recounts the story of their bequest of the lands to the parish to support the annual dole and goes on to say that despite the antiquity of the events described he has no doubt as to their authenticity
as with all accounts of the tradition prior to <year> the author does not mention their alleged birth in <num> or the name of chulkhurst these details first appeared in a broadside published in <year>
the antiquarian repertory of <year> says that the sisters had lived as tradition says two hundred and fifty years ago
drawings of biddenden cakes from this period show that they featured an image of two women possibly conjoined but no names dates or ages
historian edward hasted in the third volume of the history and topographical survey of the county of kent published in <year> dismissed the legend of the biddenden maids
he claimed that the bread and cheese lands were the gift of two women named preston although he elsewhere described the lands as having been given by persons unknown
hasted stated that the biddenden cakes had only begun to be moulded with the imprint of two women in the last <num> years i
e
since <year> and that the figures were intended to represent two poor widows as the general objects of a charitable benefaction
while he mentioned a legend that the figures represent two conjoined twins who died in their <num> and bequeathed the bread and cheese lands to the parish he dismissed it as a vulgar tradition
hasted 's arguments were largely accepted by influential historian robert chambers and the story was generally treated as a folk myth
a letter to the british medical journal in <year> pointed out that surnames were not in use in kent in the <num> century and that in older styles of english handwriting the <num> and <num> characters could easily be confused and suggested a correct birthdate of <year>
the biddenden maids were occasionally mentioned in pieces on conjoined twins particularly after chang and eng bunker proved that conjoined twins could live to an advanced age and lead relatively normal lives
notes and queries magazine called in <year> for a close examination of biddenden documents the editors describing hasted 's conclusions as very obscure and unsatisfactory and questioning why the names eliza and mary chulkhurst should have been added to the design of cakes granted by a family named preston but no significant research into the tradition was carried out
in <year> a broadside featuring a woodcut of the twins and a brief history of their alleged story was sold outside the church at easter the first recorded mention of the names eliza and mary chulkhurst and clay replicas of biddenden cakes were sold as souvenirs
in the <num> a new account of the biddenden maids was published which claimed that a gravestone marked with a diagonal line near the rector 's pew in biddenden church was the sisters burial place
in <year> it was noted that biddenden was becoming thronged by visitors every easter attracted from the adjacent towns and villages by the usage and the wonderful account of its origin and the day is spent in rude festivity
the large crowds were increasingly disorderly and churchwardens on occasion had to use their staffs to hold back the mob
as a result the distribution of the dole was moved from the church to the workhouse but the crowds continued to cause problems
in <year> biddenden 's rector applied for authority to abandon the ceremony the archbishop of canterbury permitted the distribution of bread cheese and biddenden cakes to continue but abolished the free beer in an effort to combat the problem of unruly crowds
in <year> antiquarian george clinch investigated the biddenden maids in detail
examining the costumes of the figures on the biddenden cake moulds he concluded that the style of dress depicted dated from the reign of mary i <year> – <year> a date roughly consistent with the two hundred and fifty years ago reported in <year> and concluded that the tradition had originated in the <num> century
he suggested that the <num> date on biddenden cakes had originally read <year> and explained the absence of names on prints of <num> century biddenden cakes as an engraving error
it is likely that the cake moulds examined by clinch were not the original moulds as the designs clinch examined are strikingly different to the earliest surviving drawings of biddenden cakes published in <year>
writing in the early <num> william coles finch explains the confusion over the dates saying the old @-@ fashioned numeral five is so frequently taken as a one
he lamented the quality of the biddenden cake then being produced compared to that of former years
coles finch stated that the villagers considered the then @-@ current cake to be unleavened bread
although such a fusion is theoretically possible in that twins fused at one point may form a secondary fusion elsewhere no case of a viable double fusion has ever been documented
although clinch believed that the evidence pointed to the twins having genuinely existed but that they had lived in the <num> century rather than the early <num> century as generally claimed they are not mentioned in any journals or books from the period
this points against their having lived in the <num> century the case of lazarus and joannes baptista colloredo <year> – after <year> had prompted great interest in conjoined twins and conjoined sisters surviving to adulthood in south east england would have been widely noted
in <year> surgeon j
w
ballantyne considered the case of the biddenden maids from a teratological perspective
he suggested that they had in fact been pygopagus twins joined at the pelvis
pygopagus twins are known to put their arms around each other 's shoulders when walking and ballantyne suggested that this accounted for their apparently being joined at the shoulders in drawings
the pygopagus millie and christine mccoy had lived in britain for a short time before going on to a successful singing career in the united states and it was known from their case that such twins were capable of surviving to adulthood
jan bondeson <year> and <year> proposed that while the names eliza and mary chulkhurst are not recorded in any early documents and are likely to have been a later addition the existence of the twins and the claimed <num> year of birth cannot be dismissed
although mediaeval chronicles are unreliable he noted multiple reports in the chronicon scotorum the annals of the four masters and the annals of clonmacnoise of a pair of conjoined sisters born in or around <num> although all three are records of irish history and none mention kent as the location
he concluded that the case of christine mccoy who survived for eight hours following the death of her polypagus twin millie shows that the claimed six hours between the deaths of the biddenden maids is plausible and agreed with ballantyne 's proposal that the idea that the twins were joined at the shoulder is a later misinterpretation of the figures on the biddenden cake
he also pointed out that although there is no recorded version of the legend prior to <year> there would have been no possible motive for the villagers of the <num> century to fabricate the story
the bread and cheese lands were sold for housing expanding the charity significantly to provide biddenden pensioners and widows with bread cheese and tea at easter a cash payment at christmas and distribute biddenden cakes
during the food rationing of the <num> and early <num> the cheese was replaced by cocoa
distribution of cheese resumed in <year>
a wrought iron village sign showing the biddenden maids was erected on biddenden village green in the <num>
the tradition of the dole continues to the present and every easter monday tea cheese and bread are given to local widows and pensioners through the windows of biddenden 's former workhouse
all those eligible for the annual dole are given a biddenden cake and they are sold as souvenirs to visitors
the cakes are baked so hard as to be inedible to allow better preservation as souvenirs they are baked in large batches every few years and kept until the stock runs out
historically the loaves used were of the archaic quartern loaf size but this particular part of the tradition ended when biddenden 's last bakery closed in the <num>
he previously held the offices of abbot of st albans abbey and bishop of ramsbury as well as likely being the abbot of abingdon abbey
after his election to canterbury he continued to hold the bishopric of ramsbury along with the archbishopric of canterbury until his death in <num>
ælfric may have altered the composition of canterbury 's cathedral chapter by changing the clergy serving in the cathedral from secular clergy to monks
in his will he left a ship to king æthelred ii of england as well as more ships to other legatees
he was very likely abbot of abingdon before becoming abbot of st albans abbey around <num> although some historians do not believe that he held the office of abbot at abingdon
although the historia ecclesie abbendonensis or history of the church of abingdon names ælfric as abbot the abbatial lists do not record him as such
indirect corroboration of his being abbot at abingdon is a grant of land to ælfric personally instead of to the office he held while he was archbishop that had previously been unjustly taken from abingdon
this land was to revert to abingdon after ælfric 's death
between <num> and <num> ælfric rose to the bishopric of ramsbury and possibly continued to hold office of abbot of st albans while bishop
in <num> he was elevated to the see of canterbury
he was translated or moved with appropriate ecclesiastical ceremony to canterbury on <num> april <num> at a witenagemot held at amesbury
here he received the permission of king æthelred and all the witan to be elevated to canterbury
ælfric continued to hold ramsbury along with canterbury until his death
the story that his brother was chosen first for canterbury but refused stems from confusion on the part of matthew of paris and historians generally hold the entire episode to be untrue
ælfric 's appointment to canterbury caused consternation with the clergy of the cathedral chapter
in reaction the chapter sent two members to rome ahead of ælfric and tried to secure the archbishopric for either of the monks
pope gregory v however would not appoint a candidate without royal permission which neither of the monks had
instead when ælfric arrived in rome in <num> he was appointed and received the pallium a symbol of an archbishop 's authority
he also witnessed some miracles at the gravesite of edward the martyr at shaftesbury abbey helping to lead to edward 's sainthood
a story was told that ælfric introduced monks into the cathedral church of christ church canterbury replacing the secular clerks that had taken over the foundation during the ninth century
ælfric is said to have done this on the command of the pope
this story originally dates to soon after the norman conquest and originated with the monastic historians of canterbury and its veracity is unclear
he likely performed the marriage ceremony of king æthelred the unready and emma of normandy in <num>
a later tradition held that he consecrated a bishop of llandaff and two bishops of st
david 's in wales which if true would have meant extending canterbury 's jurisdiction into new territory
either ælfric or his predecessor sigeric wrote a letter to wulfsige bishop of sherborne about the duties of bishops to make sure that the laity did not despoil churches
the letter also urged wulfsige to exhort the laity to strive for justice in their dealings with others help widows and orphans not fight as well as other moral precepts
ælfric also ordered the composition of the first life of dunstan a hagiography or saint 's life of dunstan a predecessor as archbishop of canterbury
he also acted as a royal judge once being ordered by king æthelred to adjudicate a case between thegns or local noblemen
his will survives and in it he left ships to the people of wiltshire and kent with his best one equipped for sixty men going to king æthelred
the hagiography of dunstan was dedicated to ælfric at the end of the <num> century
after his death he was considered a saint with a feast day of <num> november
originally published as a short story in life in <year> <num> october the full novel was published in <year> in french in france by éditions gallimard
gary 's english version of the novel was published in north america in the same year by new american library
the novel provides a fictionalized account of gary and his wife 's experiences in the <num> with a stray alabama police dog trained to attack black people on sight and their attempts to have the dog reprogrammed
gary uses the novel as a vehicle to denounce both racism and the activists supporting african @-@ american rights including his own ex @-@ wife and marlon brando
he also examines whether human responses to situations including racism are learned social behavior and whether they can be unlearned
in <year> it was adapted into the controversial film of the same name in which director samuel fuller made various changes to the novel 's story to focus more on the dog and present a more pessimistic ending than the original novel
the film 's american release after negative press from the national association for the advancement of colored people naacp led to concerns of boycotts
at first the dog which they name batka is an ideal new member of the family intelligent devoted and quickly befriending the couple 's assortment of other animals
to their dismay they discover that the dog a former alabama police dog was trained to attack black people on sight
although they are told the dog is too old to be retrained they take him to a black dog trainer to try
instead the man trains the dog to attack white people including gary himself
gary states that he changed the ending of the american version to be more optimistic
it was published as a full novel in <year> in two languages and two countries
a french @-@ language version was published in france under the title chien blanc by éditions gallimard isbn 207027022x in april <year>
gary who was multi @-@ lingual also wrote an english version which was published by new american library in <year> under its signet label
the violence depicted also provides a discourse on revolutionary social change as it also leads to a new order a new reality
gary excoriates american racism black activism and movie @-@ colony liberalism and reflects on american race relations as a whole
he also documents his own intolerance of intolerance that is the curse of tolerance
through the dog gary examines whether a learned response can be unlearned
he also poses the question of how much freedom and uniqueness a person can claim if humans responses are indeed learned by social indoctrination
within the novel gary makes scathing attacks on self @-@ aggrandising jewish pro @-@ black sentiment and self @-@ serving celebrity campaigners while making explicit attacks against marlon brando and seberg for their involvement in civil rights movements and the latter 's involvement with the black panthers organization
in an interview about the novel gary states that as a typical american idealist she was an easy mark for people seeking money for causes and he depicts this in the novel by having her frequently appearing in activist events writing checks
after her death he called the novel the story of her crusade
phoebe adams of the atlantic felt the story was ironic and noted that it was presumably true
she felt the depiction of marlon brando was tartly funny and that story as a whole served as an excuse for mr
gary 's comments on racial affairs in this country a matter on which is somewhat less pessimistic than the natives and a good deal more sensible
the globe and mail 's h
j
kirchhoff considered it a riveting thoughtful work that serves as a metaphor for american racism
julien roumette felt romain 's depiction of the racial tensions in america at the time was meticulously reconstituted with a realistic even documentary rather exceptional dimension
julia weldon of harper 's magazine remarked with amusement that the events of the novel were ones that only a frenchman could have found himself in
she felt the novel was a decathlon event in which gary turned a household crisis into a full @-@ scale allegory
overall she praised the book as a memorable portrait of guilt and largess in black and white noting she felt gary had lived to witness his own maturity though she also wondered if he stretched the truth to make himself a legend in his own time
various changes were made from the original novel 's story including the removal of gary himself and a tighter focus on the dog
gary 's wife was replaced in the script with a young unmarried actress as paramount wanted the film to show a strong contrast between the loving relationship between the protagonist and the dog 's random attacks
the novel 's hate @-@ filled muslim black trainer was converted into the character named keys who genuinely wished to cure the animal
the novel 's original ending was also changed to make it more pessimistic
directed by samuel fuller and starring paul winfield and kristy mcnichol the film 's theatrical release was suppressed in the united states out of concern of negative press after rumors began circulating from the naacp that the film was racist
it was released internationally in france and the united kingdom in <year> and broadcast on various american cable television channels
its first official american release came in december <year> when the criterion collection released the original uncut film to dvd
in reflecting on the film fuller notes that he had known gary before being offered the chance to direct the white dog adaptation and greatly admired both gary and the novel
he wanted to have the film dedicated to gary who had committed suicide before the film was completed but the studio declined
in an interview with the los angeles times he stated i know gary would have liked it
and he 'd have been pleased because his other books the roots of heaven etc had not done well as films
it is rolled onto an erect penis before intercourse and blocks ejaculated semen from entering the body of a sexual partner
condoms are also used during fellatio and for collection of semen for use in infertility treatment
in the modern age condoms are most often made from latex but some are made from other materials such as polyurethane polyisoprene or lamb intestine
a female condom is also available often made of nitrile rubber
as a method of birth control male condoms have the advantages of being inexpensive easy to use having few side effects and offering protection against sexually transmitted infections
with proper use — and use at every act of intercourse — women whose partners use male condoms experience a <num> per @-@ year pregnancy rate
with typical use the rate of pregnancy is <num> per @-@ year
condoms have been used for at least <num> years
since the <num> century they have been one of the most popular methods of contraception in the world
while widely accepted in modern times condoms have generated some controversy primarily over what role they should play in sex education classes
perfect use or method effectiveness rates only include people who use condoms properly and consistently
actual use or typical use effectiveness rates are of all condom users including those who use condoms incorrectly or do not use condoms at every act of intercourse
rates are generally presented for the first year of use
most commonly the pearl index is used to calculate effectiveness rates but some studies use decrement tables
the typical use pregnancy rate among condom users varies depending on the population being studied ranging from <num> to <num> per year
the perfect use pregnancy rate of condoms is <num> per year
condoms may be combined with other forms of contraception such as spermicide for greater protection
they have been shown to be effective in reducing infection rates in both men and women but not eliminating it
while not perfect the condom is effective at reducing the transmission of organisms that cause aids genital herpes cervical cancer genital warts syphilis chlamydia gonorrhea and other diseases
condoms are often recommended as an adjunct to more effective birth control methods such as iud in situations where std protection is also desired
according to a <year> report by the national institutes of health nih consistent use of latex condoms reduces the risk of hiv aids transmission by approximately <num> relative to risk when unprotected putting the seroconversion rate infection rate at <num>
<num> per <num> person @-@ years with condom down from <num>
<num> per <num> person @-@ years
analysis published in <year> from the university of texas medical branch and the world health organization found similar risk reductions of <num> – <num>
the <year> nih review concluded that condom use significantly reduces the risk of gonorrhea for men
a <year> study reports that proper condom use decreases the risk of transmission of human papillomavirus hpv to women by approximately <num>
another study in the same year found consistent condom use was effective at reducing transmission of herpes simplex virus @-@ <num> also known as genital herpes in both men and women
although a condom is effective in limiting exposure some disease transmission may occur even with a condom
infectious areas of the genitals especially when symptoms are present may not be covered by a condom and as a result some diseases like hpv and herpes may be transmitted by direct contact
the primary effectiveness issue with using condoms to prevent stds however is inconsistent use
condoms may also be useful in treating potentially precancerous cervical changes
exposure to human papillomavirus even in individuals already infected with the virus appears to increase the risk of precancerous changes
the use of condoms helps promote regression of these changes
in addition researchers in the uk suggest that a hormone in semen can aggravate existing cervical cancer condom use during sex can prevent exposure to the hormone
the rate of breakage is between <num>
<num> and <num>
<num> while the rate of slippage is between <num>
<num> and <num>
<num>
even if no breakage or slippage is observed <num> – <num> of women will test positive for semen residue after intercourse with a condom
double bagging using two condoms at once is often believed to cause a higher rate of failure due to the friction of rubber on rubber
this claim is not supported by research
the limited studies that have been done on the subject support that double bagging is likely not harmful and possibly beneficial
different modes of condom failure result in different levels of semen exposure
if a failure occurs during application the damaged condom may be disposed of and a new condom applied before intercourse begins – such failures generally pose no risk to the user
one study found that semen exposure from a broken condom was about half that of unprotected intercourse semen exposure from a slipped condom was about one @-@ fifth that of unprotected intercourse
standard condoms will fit almost any penis with varying degrees of comfort or risk of slippage
many condom manufacturers offer snug or magnum sizes
some manufacturers also offer custom sized @-@ to @-@ fit condoms with claims that they are more reliable and offer improved sensation comfort
some studies have associated larger penises and smaller condoms with increased breakage and decreased slippage rates and vice versa but other studies have been inconclusive
it is recommended for condoms manufacturers to avoid very thick or very thin condoms because they are both considered less effective
some authors encourage users to choose thinner condoms for greater durability sensation and comfort but others warn that the thinner the condom the smaller the force required to break it
experienced condom users are significantly less likely to have a condom slip or break compared to first @-@ time users although users who experience one slippage or breakage are more likely to suffer a second such failure
an article in population reports suggests that education on condom use reduces behaviors that increase the risk of breakage and slippage
a family health international publication also offers the view that education can reduce the risk of breakage and slippage but emphasizes that more research needs to be done to determine all of the causes of breakage and slippage
among people who intend condoms to be their form of birth control pregnancy may occur when the user has sex without a condom
the person may have run out of condoms or be traveling and not have a condom with them or simply dislike the feel of condoms and decide to take a chance
this type of behavior is the primary cause of typical use failure as opposed to method or perfect use failure
another possible cause of condom failure is sabotage
one motive is to have a child against a partner 's wishes or consent
some commercial sex workers from nigeria reported clients sabotaging condoms in retaliation for being coerced into condom use
using a fine needle to make several pinholes at the tip of the condom is believed to significantly impact their effectiveness
cases of such condom sabotage have occurred
in people with severe latex allergies using a latex condom can potentially be life @-@ threatening
repeated use of latex condoms can also cause the development of a latex allergy in some people
it is important that some space be left in the tip of the condom so that semen has a place to collect otherwise it may be forced out of the base of the device
after use it is recommended the condom be wrapped in tissue or tied in a knot then disposed of in a trash receptacle
condoms are used to reduce the likelihood of pregnancy during intercourse and to reduce the likelihood of contracting sexually @-@ transmitted infections stis
condoms are also used during fellatio to reduce the likelihood of contracting stis
some couples find that putting on a condom interrupts sex although others incorporate condom application as part of their foreplay
some men and women find the physical barrier of a condom dulls sensation
advantages of dulled sensation can include prolonged erection and delayed ejaculation disadvantages might include a loss of some sexual excitement
advocates of condom use also cite their advantages of being inexpensive easy to use and having few side effects
as a result measure b a law requiring the use of condoms in the production of pornographic films was passed
this requirement has received much criticism and is said by some to be counter @-@ productive merely forcing companies that make pornographic films to relocate to other places without this requirement
producers claim that condom use depresses sales
a recent american psychological association apa press release supported the inclusion of information about condoms in sex education saying comprehensive sexuality education programs
discuss the appropriate use of condoms and promote condom use for those who are sexually active
in the united states teaching about condoms in public schools is opposed by some religious organizations
planned parenthood which advocates family planning and sex education argues that no studies have shown abstinence @-@ only programs to result in delayed intercourse and cites surveys showing that <num> of american parents want their children to receive comprehensive sexuality education including condom use
these are most commonly obtained through masturbation but an alternative to masturbation is use of a special collection condom to collect semen during sexual intercourse
collection condoms are made from silicone or polyurethane as latex is somewhat harmful to sperm
many men prefer collection condoms to masturbation and some religions prohibit masturbation entirely
also compared with samples obtained from masturbation semen samples from collection condoms have higher total sperm counts sperm motility and percentage of sperm with normal morphology
for this reason they are believed to give more accurate results when used for semen analysis and to improve the chances of pregnancy when used in procedures such as intracervical or intrauterine insemination
adherents of religions that prohibit contraception such as catholicism may use collection condoms with holes pricked in them
for fertility treatments a collection condom may be used to collect semen during sexual intercourse where the semen is provided by the woman 's partner
private sperm donors may also use a collection condom to obtain samples through masturbation or by sexual intercourse with a partner and will transfer the ejaculate from the collection condom to a specially designed container
the sperm is transported in such containers in the case of a donor to a recipient woman to be used for insemination and in the case of a woman 's partner to a fertility clinic for processing and use
however transportation may reduce the fecundity of the sperm
collection condoms may also be used where semen is produced at a sperm bank or fertility clinic
condom therapy is sometimes prescribed to infertile couples when the female has high levels of antisperm antibodies
the theory is that preventing exposure to her partner 's semen will lower her level of antisperm antibodies and thus increase her chances of pregnancy when condom therapy is discontinued
however condom therapy has not been shown to increase subsequent pregnancy rates
ongoing military utilization began during world war ii and includes covering the muzzles of rifle barrels to prevent fouling the waterproofing of firing assemblies in underwater demolitions and storage of corrosive materials and garrotes by paramilitary agencies
condoms have also been used to smuggle alcohol cocaine heroin and other drugs across borders and into prisons by filling the condom with drugs tying it in a knot and then either swallowing it or inserting it into the rectum
these methods are very dangerous and potentially lethal if the condom breaks the drugs inside become absorbed into the bloodstream and can cause an overdose
medically condoms can be used to cover endovaginal ultrasound probes or in field chest needle decompressions they can be used to make a one @-@ way valve
condoms have also been used to protect scientific samples from the environment and to waterproof microphones for underwater recording
condoms come in different sizes from oversized to snug and they also come in a variety of surfaces intended to stimulate the user 's partner
condoms are usually supplied with a lubricant coating to facilitate penetration while flavored condoms are principally used for oral sex
as mentioned above most condoms are made of latex but polyurethane and lambskin condoms also exist
the female health company produced a female condom that was initially made of polyurethane but newer versions are made of nitrile
medtech products produces a female condom made of latex
in <year> the iso set standards for condom production iso <num> natural latex rubber condoms and the eu followed suit with its cen standard directive <num> <num> eec concerning medical devices
every latex condom is tested for holes with an electric current
if the condom passes it is rolled and packaged
in addition a portion of each batch of condoms is subject to water leak and air burst testing
while the advantages of latex have made it the most popular condom material it does have some drawbacks
latex condoms are damaged when used with oil @-@ based substances as lubricants such as petroleum jelly cooking oil baby oil mineral oil skin lotions suntan lotions cold creams butter or margarine
contact with oil makes latex condoms more likely to break or slip off due to loss of elasticity caused by the oils
additionally latex allergy precludes use of latex condoms and is one of the principal reasons for the use of other materials
in may <year> the u
s
food and drug administration granted approval for the production of condoms composed of vytex latex that has been treated to remove <num> of the proteins responsible for allergic reactions
an allergen @-@ free condom made of synthetic latex polyisoprene is also available
condoms may also be made from other synthetic materials such as at @-@ <num> resin and most recently polyisoprene
polyurethane condoms tend to be the same width and thickness as latex condoms with most polyurethane condoms between <num>
<num> mm and <num>
<num> mm thick
polyurethane can be considered better than latex in several ways it conducts heat better than latex is not as sensitive to temperature and ultraviolet light and so has less rigid storage requirements and a longer shelf life can be used with oil @-@ based lubricants is less allergenic than latex and does not have an odor
polyurethane condoms have gained fda approval for sale in the united states as an effective method of contraception and hiv prevention and under laboratory conditions have been shown to be just as effective as latex for these purposes
however polyurethane condoms are less elastic than latex ones and may be more likely to slip or break than latex lose their shape or bunch up more than latex and are more expensive
polyisoprene is a synthetic version of natural rubber latex
while significantly more expensive it has the advantages of latex such as being softer and more elastic than polyurethane condoms without the protein which is responsible for latex allergies
like polyurethane condoms polyisoprene condoms are said to do a better job of transmitting body heat
unlike polyurethane condoms they cannot be used with an oil @-@ based lubricant
although they are generally effective as a contraceptive by blocking sperm it is presumed that they are likely less effective than latex in preventing the transmission of agents that cause stds because of pores in the material
this is based on the idea that intestines by their nature are porous permeable membranes and while sperm are too large to pass through the pores viruses — such as hiv herpes and genital warts — are small enough to pass through
however there are to date no clinical data confirming or denying this theory
some believe that lambskin condoms provide a more natural sensation and they lack the allergens that are inherent to latex but because of their lesser protection against infection other hypoallergenic materials such as polyurethane are recommended for latex @-@ allergic users and or partners
lambskin condoms are also significantly more expensive than other types and as slaughter by @-@ products they are also not vegetarian
according to consumer reports condoms lubricated with spermicide have no additional benefit in preventing pregnancy have a shorter shelf life and may cause urinary @-@ tract infections in women
in contrast application of separately packaged spermicide is believed to increase the contraceptive efficacy of condoms
nonoxynol @-@ <num> was once believed to offer additional protection against stds including hiv but recent studies have shown that with frequent use nonoxynol @-@ <num> may increase the risk of hiv transmission
the world health organization says that spermicidally lubricated condoms should no longer be promoted
however it recommends using a nonoxynol @-@ <num> lubricated condom over no condom at all
as of <year> nine condom manufacturers have stopped manufacturing condoms with nonoxynol @-@ <num> and planned parenthood has discontinued the distribution of condoms so lubricated
the studs or ribs can be located on the inside outside or both alternatively they are located in specific sections to provide directed stimulation to either the g @-@ spot or frenulum
many textured condoms which advertise mutual pleasure also are bulb @-@ shaped at the top to provide extra stimulation to the penis
some women experience irritation during vaginal intercourse with studded condoms
this was due to the fact that standard condoms were too wide and consequently failed to afford protection to adolescent boys during vaginal and anal intercourse
family planning groups and the swiss aids federation had campaigned to have a narrower condom produced for youths after a number of studies including a government study researched at the centre for development and personality psychology at basel university found that standard condoms were unsuitable for boys in this age range and that the condoms either failed during use or that the boys rejected them altogether because they were too wide and consequently they used no protection at all
as a result of these studies a condom aimed at <num> to <num> @-@ year @-@ old boys is now produced and is available in switzerland and in certain other countries
manufactured by ceylor the hotshot is a lubricated teat @-@ ended latex condom which is narrower than a standard condom and has a tight band at the opening to ensure that it remains on the youth 's penis during intercourse

a collection condom is used to collect semen for fertility treatments or sperm analysis
these condoms are designed to maximize sperm life
some condom @-@ like devices are intended for entertainment only such as glow @-@ in @-@ the dark condoms
these novelty condoms may not provide protection against pregnancy and stds
most surveys of contraceptive use are among married women or women in informal unions
japan has the highest rate of condom usage in the world in that country condoms account for almost <num> of contraceptive use by married women
on average in developed countries condoms are the most popular method of birth control <num> of married contraceptive users rely on condoms
in the average less @-@ developed country condoms are less common only <num> – <num> of married contraceptive users choose condoms
in ancient egypt greece and rome pregnancy prevention was generally seen as a woman 's responsibility and the only well documented contraception methods were female @-@ controlled devices
in asia before the <num> century some use of glans condoms devices covering only the head of the penis is recorded
condoms seem to have been used for contraception and to have been known only by members of the upper classes
in china glans condoms may have been made of oiled silk paper or of lamb intestines
in japan they were made of tortoise shell or animal horn
in <num> century italy gabriele falloppio wrote a treatise on syphilis
the earliest documented strain of syphilis first appearing in europe in a <num> outbreak caused severe symptoms and often death within a few months of contracting the disease
falloppio 's treatise is the earliest uncontested description of condom use it describes linen sheaths soaked in a chemical solution and allowed to dry before use
the cloths he described were sized to cover the glans of the penis and were held on with a ribbon
falloppio claimed that an experimental trial of the linen sheath demonstrated protection against syphilis
after this the use of penis coverings to protect from disease is described in a wide variety of literature throughout europe
the first indication that these devices were used for birth control rather than disease prevention is the <year> theological publication de iustitia et iure on justice and law by catholic theologian leonardus lessius who condemned them as immoral
in <year> the english birth rate commission attributed a recent downward fertility rate to use of condons the first documented use of that word or any similar spelling
in addition to linen condoms during the renaissance were made out of intestines and bladder
in the late <num> century dutch traders introduced condoms made from fine leather to japan
unlike the horn condoms used previously these leather condoms covered the entire penis
casanova in the <num> century was one of the first reported using assurance caps to prevent impregnating his mistresses
from at least the <num> century condom use was opposed in some legal religious and medical circles for essentially the same reasons that are given today condoms reduce the likelihood of pregnancy which some thought immoral or undesirable for the nation they do not provide full protection against sexually transmitted infections while belief in their protective powers was thought to encourage sexual promiscuity and they are not used consistently due to inconvenience expense or loss of sensation
despite some opposition the condom market grew rapidly
in the <num> century condoms were available in a variety of qualities and sizes made from either linen treated with chemicals or skin bladder or intestine softened by treatment with sulfur and lye
they were sold at pubs barbershops chemist shops open @-@ air markets and at the theater throughout europe and russia
they later spread to america although in every place there were generally used only by the middle and upper classes due to both expense and lack of sex education
writers on contraception tended to prefer other methods of birth control to the condom
by the late <num> century many feminists expressed distrust of the condom as a contraceptive as its use was controlled and decided upon by men alone
they advocated instead for methods which were controlled by women such as diaphragms and spermicidal douches
other writers cited both the expense of condoms and their unreliability they were often riddled with holes and often fell off or broke but they discussed condoms as a good option for some and as the only contraceptive that also protected from disease
many countries passed laws impeding the manufacture and promotion of contraceptives
in spite of these restrictions condoms were promoted by traveling lecturers and in newspaper advertisements using euphemisms in places where such ads were illegal
instructions on how to make condoms at home were distributed in the united states and europe
despite social and legal opposition at the end of the <num> century the condom was the western world 's most popular birth control method
beginning in the second half of the <num> century american rates of sexually transmitted diseases skyrocketed
causes cited by historians include effects of the american civil war and the ignorance of prevention methods promoted by the comstock laws
to fight the growing epidemic sex education classes were introduced to public schools for the first time teaching about venereal diseases and how they were transmitted
they generally taught that abstinence was the only way to avoid sexually transmitted diseases
condoms were not promoted for disease prevention because the medical community and moral watchdogs considered stds to be punishment for sexual misbehavior
the stigma against victims of these diseases was so great that many hospitals refused to treat people who had syphilis
the german military was the first to promote condom use among its soldiers beginning in the later <num> century
early <num> century experiments by the american military concluded that providing condoms to soldiers significantly lowered rates of sexually transmitted diseases
during world war i the united states and at the beginning of the war only britain were the only countries with soldiers in europe who did not provide condoms and promote their use
in the decades after world war i there remained social and legal obstacles to condom use throughout the u
s
and europe
founder of psychoanalysis sigmund freud opposed all methods of birth control on the grounds that their failure rates were too high
freud was especially opposed to the condom because he thought it cut down on sexual pleasure
some feminists continued to oppose male @-@ controlled contraceptives such as condoms
in <year> the church of england 's lambeth conference condemned all unnatural means of conception avoidance
london 's bishop arthur winnington @-@ ingram complained of the huge number of condoms discarded in alleyways and parks especially after weekends and holidays
however european militaries continued to provide condoms to their members for disease protection even in countries where they were illegal for the general population
through the <num> catchy names and slick packaging became an increasingly important marketing technique for many consumer items including condoms and cigarettes
quality testing became more common involving filling each condom with air followed by one of several methods intended to detect loss of pressure
worldwide condom sales doubled in the <num>
this proved to have advantages for the manufacture of condoms unlike the sheep 's gut condoms they could stretch and did not tear quickly when used
the rubber vulcanization process was patented by goodyear in <year>
the first rubber condom was produced in <year>
the earliest rubber condoms had a seam and were as thick as a bicycle inner tube
besides this type small rubber condoms covering only the glans were often used in england and the united states
there was more risk of losing them and if the rubber ring was too tight it would constrict the penis
this type of condom was the original capote french for condom perhaps because of its resemblance to a woman 's bonnet worn at that time also called a capote
for many decades rubber condoms were manufactured by wrapping strips of raw rubber around penis @-@ shaped molds then dipping the wrapped molds in a chemical solution to cure the rubber
in <year> polish inventor julius fromm developed a new improved manufacturing technique for condoms dipping glass molds into a raw rubber solution
called cement dipping this method required adding gasoline or benzene to the rubber to make it liquid
latex rubber suspended in water was invented in <year>
latex condoms required less labor to produce than cement @-@ dipped rubber condoms which had to be smoothed by rubbing and trimming
the use of water to suspend the rubber instead of gasoline and benzene eliminated the fire hazard previously associated with all condom factories
latex condoms also performed better for the consumer they were stronger and thinner than rubber condoms and had a shelf life of five years compared to three months for rubber
until the twenties all condoms were individually hand @-@ dipped by semi @-@ skilled workers
throughout the decade of the <num> advances in the automation of the condom assembly line were made
the first fully automated line was patented in <year>
major condom manufacturers bought or leased conveyor systems and small manufacturers were driven out of business
the skin condom now significantly more expensive than the latex variety became restricted to a niche high @-@ end market
in <year> the federal council of churches in the u
s
issued a similar statement
the roman catholic church responded by issuing the encyclical casti connubii affirming its opposition to all contraceptives a stance it has never reversed
in the <num> legal restrictions on condoms began to be relaxed
but during this period fascist italy and nazi germany increased restrictions on condoms limited sales as disease preventatives were still allowed
during the depression condom lines by schmid gained in popularity
schmid still used the cement @-@ dipping method of manufacture which had two advantages over the latex variety
firstly cement @-@ dipped condoms could be safely used with oil @-@ based lubricants
secondly while less comfortable these older @-@ style rubber condoms could be reused and so were more economical a valued feature in hard times
more attention was brought to quality issues in the <num> and the u
s
food and drug administration began to regulate the quality of condoms sold in the united states
throughout world war ii condoms were not only distributed to male u
s
military members but also heavily promoted with films posters and lectures
european and asian militaries on both sides of the conflict also provided condoms to their troops throughout the war even germany which outlawed all civilian use of condoms in <year>
in part because condoms were readily available soldiers found a number of non @-@ sexual uses for the devices many of which continue to this day
after the war condom sales continued to grow
from <year> – <year> <num> of americans of reproductive age relied on condoms for birth control
in britain from <year> – <year> <num> of married couples used condoms
the birth control pill became the world 's most popular method of birth control in the years after its <year> début but condoms remained a strong second
the u
s
agency for international development pushed condom use in developing countries to help solve the world population crises by <year> hundreds of millions of condoms were being used each year in india alone
this number has grown in recent decades in <year> the government of india purchased <num>
<num> billion condoms for distribution at family planning clinics
in the <num> and <num> quality regulations tightened and more legal barriers to condom use were removed
in ireland legal condom sales were allowed for the first time in <year>
advertising however was one area that continued to have legal restrictions
in the late <num> the american national association of broadcasters banned condom advertisements from national television this policy remained in place until <year>
after learning in the early <num> that aids can be a sexually transmitted infection the use of condoms was encouraged to prevent transmission of hiv
despite opposition by some political religious and other figures national condom promotion campaigns occurred in the u
s
and europe
these campaigns increased condom use significantly
due to increased demand and greater social acceptance condoms began to be sold in a wider variety of retail outlets including in supermarkets and in discount department stores such as wal @-@ mart
condom sales increased every year until <year> when media attention to the aids pandemic began to decline
the phenomenon of decreasing use of condoms as disease preventatives has been called prevention fatigue or condom fatigue
observers have cited condom fatigue in both europe and north america
as one response manufacturers have changed the tone of their advertisements from scary to humorous
new developments continued to occur in the condom market with the first polyurethane condom — branded avanti and produced by the manufacturer of durex — introduced in the <num> and the first custom sized @-@ to @-@ fit condom called theyfit introduced in the early <num>
worldwide condom use is expected to continue to grow one study predicted that developing nations would need <num>
<num> billion condoms by <year>
as of september <year> condoms are available inside prisons in canada most of the european union australia brazil indonesia south africa and the us states of vermont on september <num> <year> the californian senate approved a bill for condom distribution inside the state 's prisons but the bill was not yet law at the time of approval
its etymology is unknown
in popular tradition the invention and naming of the condom came to be attributed to an associate of england 's king charles ii one dr
condom or earl of condom
there is however no evidence of the existence of such a person and condoms had been used for over one hundred years before king charles ii ascended to the throne
a variety of unproven latin etymologies have been proposed including condon receptacle condamina house and cumdum scabbard or case
it has also been speculated to be from the italian word guantone derived from guanto meaning glove
william e
kruck wrote an article in <year> concluding that as for the word condom i need state only that its origin remains completely unknown and there ends this search for an etymology
modern dictionaries may also list the etymology as unknown
other terms are also commonly used to describe condoms
in north america condoms are also commonly known as prophylactics or rubbers
in britain they may be called french letters
additionally condoms may be referred to using the manufacturer 's name
condom usage is typically recommended for new couples who have yet to develop full trust in their partner with regard to stds
established couples on the other hand have few concerns about stds and can use other methods of birth control such as the pill which does not act as a barrier to intimate sexual contact
note that the polar debate with regard to condom usage is attenuated by the target group the argument is directed
notably the age category and stable partner question are factors as well as the distinction between heterosexual and homosexuals who have different kinds of sex and have different risk consequences and factors
among the prime objections to condom usage is the blocking of erotic sensation and or the intimacy that barrier @-@ free sex provides
as the condom is held tightly to the skin of the penis it diminishes the delivery of stimulation through rubbing and friction
condom proponents claim this has the benefit of making sex last longer by diminishing sensation and delaying male ejaculation
those who promote condom @-@ free heterosexual sex slang bareback claim that the condom puts a prophylactic barrier between partners diminishing what is normally a highly sensual intimate and spiritual connection between partners
the use of condoms to prevent std transmission is not specifically addressed by catholic doctrine and is currently a topic of debate among theologians and high @-@ ranking catholic authorities
a few such as belgian cardinal godfried danneels believe the catholic church should actively support condoms used to prevent disease especially serious diseases such as aids
however the majority view — including all statements from the vatican — is that condom @-@ promotion programs encourage promiscuity thereby actually increasing std transmission
this view was most recently reiterated in <year> by pope benedict xvi
the roman catholic church is the largest organized body of any world religion
the church has hundreds of programs dedicated to fighting the aids epidemic in africa but its opposition to condom use in these programs has been highly controversial
in a november <year> interview the pope discussed for the first time the use of condoms to prevent std transmission
he said that the use of a condom can be justified in a few individual cases if the purpose is to reduce the risk of an hiv infection
he gave as an example male prostitutes
there was some confusion at first whether the statement applied only to homosexual prostitutes and thus not to heterosexual intercourse at all
however federico lombardi spokesman for the vatican clarified that it applied to heterosexual and transsexual prostitutes whether male or female as well
he did however also clarify that the vatican 's principles on sexuality and contraception had not been changed
dry dusting powders are applied to latex condoms before packaging to prevent the condom from sticking to itself when rolled up
previously talc was used by most manufacturers but cornstarch is currently the most popular dusting powder
talc is known to be toxic if it enters the abdominal cavity i
e
via the vagina
cornstarch is generally believed to be safe however some researchers have raised concerns over its use as well
nitrosamines which are potentially carcinogenic in humans are believed to be present in a substance used to improve elasticity in latex condoms
a <year> review stated that humans regularly receive <num> @,@ <num> to <num> @,@ <num> times greater nitrosamine exposure from food and tobacco than from condom use and concluded that the risk of cancer from condom use is very low
however a <year> study in germany detected nitrosamines in <num> out of <num> condom brands tested and concluded that exposure from condoms might exceed the exposure from food by <num>
<num> to <num> @-@ fold
in addition the large @-@ scale use of disposable condoms has resulted in concerns over their environmental impact via littering and in landfills where they can eventually wind up in wildlife environments if not incinerated or otherwise permanently disposed of first
polyurethane condoms in particular given they are a form of plastic are not biodegradable and latex condoms take a very long time to break down
experts such as avert recommend condoms be disposed of in a garbage receptacle as flushing them down the toilet which some people do may cause plumbing blockages and other problems
furthermore the plastic and foil wrappers condoms are packaged in are also not biodegradable
however the benefits condoms offer are widely considered to offset their small landfill mass
frequent condom or wrapper disposal in public areas such as a parks have been seen as a persistent litter problem
while biodegradable latex condoms damage the environment when disposed of improperly
according to the ocean conservancy condoms along with certain other types of trash cover the coral reefs and smother sea grass and other bottom dwellers
the united states environmental protection agency also has expressed concerns that many animals might mistake the litter for food
in japan oral contraceptives were not approved for use until september <year> and even then access was more restricted than in other industrialized nations
perhaps because of this restricted access to hormonal contraception japan has the highest rate of condom usage in the world in <year> <num> of contraceptive users relied on condoms
cultural attitudes toward gender roles contraception and sexual activity vary greatly around the world and range from extremely conservative to extremely liberal
but in places where condoms are misunderstood mischaracterised demonised or looked upon with overall cultural disapproval the prevalence of condom use is directly affected
in less @-@ developed countries and among less @-@ educated populations misperceptions about how disease transmission and conception work negatively affect the use of condoms additionally in cultures with more traditional gender roles women may feel uncomfortable demanding that their partners use condoms
as an example latino immigrants in the united states often face cultural barriers to condom use
a study on female hiv prevention published in the journal of sex health research asserts that latino women often lack the attitudes needed to negotiate safe sex due to traditional gender @-@ role norms in the latino community and may be afraid to bring up the subject of condom use with their partners
women who participated in the study often reported that because of the general machismo subtly encouraged in latino culture their male partners would be angry or possibly violent at the woman 's suggestion that they use condoms
a similar phenomenon has been noted in a survey of low @-@ income american black women the women in this study also reported a fear of violence at the suggestion to their male partners that condoms be used
a telephone survey conducted by rand corporation and oregon state university and published in the journal of acquired immune deficiency syndromes showed that belief in aids conspiracy theories among united states black men is linked to rates of condom use
as conspiracy beliefs about aids grow in a given sector of these black men consistent condom use drops in that same sector
female use of condoms was not similarly affected
in the african continent condom promotion in some areas has been impeded by anti @-@ condom campaigns by some muslim and catholic clerics
among the maasai in tanzania condom use is hampered by an aversion to wasting sperm which is given sociocultural importance beyond reproduction
sperm is believed to be an elixir to women and to have beneficial health effects
maasai women believe that after conceiving a child they must have sexual intercourse repeatedly so that the additional sperm aids the child 's development
frequent condom use is also considered by some maasai to cause impotence
some women in africa believe that condoms are for prostitutes and that respectable women should not use them
a few clerics even promote the idea that condoms are deliberately laced with hiv
in the united states possession of many condoms has been used by police to accuse women of engaging in prostitution
the presidential advisory council on hiv aids has condemned this practice and there are efforts to end it
in march <year> technology mogul bill gates offered a us <num> @,@ <num> grant through his foundation for a condom design that significantly preserves or enhances pleasure to encourage more males to adopt the use of condoms for safer sex
the grant information states “ the primary drawback from the male perspective is that condoms decrease pleasure as compared to no condom creating a trade @-@ off that many men find unacceptable particularly given that the decisions about use must be made just prior to intercourse
is it possible to develop a product without this stigma or better one that is felt to enhance pleasure ” the project has been named the next generation condom and anyone who can provide a testable hypothesis is eligible to apply
middle @-@ eastern couples who have not had children because of the strong desire and social pressure to establish fertility as soon as possible within marriage rarely use condoms
numerous small manufacturers nonprofit groups and government @-@ run manufacturing plants exist around the world
within the condom market there are several major contributors among them both for @-@ profit businesses and philanthropic organizations
most large manufacturers have ties to the business that reach back to the end of the <num> century
as of <year> the spray @-@ on condom was not going to market because the drying time could not be reduced below two to three minutes
the invisible condom developed at université laval in québec canada is a gel that hardens upon increased temperature after insertion into the vagina or rectum
in the lab it has been shown to effectively block hiv and herpes simplex virus
the barrier breaks down and liquefies after several hours
as of <year> the invisible condom is in the clinical trial phase and has not yet been approved for use
also developed in <year> is a condom treated with an erectogenic compound
the drug @-@ treated condom is intended to help the wearer maintain his erection which should also help reduce slippage
if approved the condom would be marketed under the durex brand
as of <year> it was still in clinical trials
in <year> ansell healthcare the makers of lifestyle condoms introduced the x2 condom lubricated with excite gel which contains the amino acid l @-@ arginine and is intended to improve the strength of the erectile response
they were designed in response to the battleships being built by germany
only four hulls of the sixteen originally planned had been laid down by <year> when the decision was made to cut the program to only three ships to divert resources to an expanded army rearmament program
these ships would have rivaled the imperial japanese yamato class and america 's planned montana class in size if any had been completed although with significantly weaker firepower nine <num> @-@ millimeter <num>
<num> in guns compared to the nine <num> @-@ millimeter <num>
<num> in guns of the japanese ships and a dozen <num> @-@ inch <num>
<num> mm on the montanas
however they would have been superior to their german rivals the bismarck class at least on paper
the failure of the soviet armor plate industry to build cemented armor plates thicker than <num> millimeters <num>
<num> in would have negated any advantages from the sovetsky soyuz class 's thicker armor in combat
construction of the first four ships was plagued with difficulties as the soviet shipbuilding and related industries were not prepared to build such large ships
one battleship sovetskaya belorussiya was cancelled on <num> october <year> after serious construction flaws were found
construction of the other three ships was suspended shortly after nazi germany invaded the soviet union in june <year> and never resumed
all three of the surviving hulls were scrapped in the late <num>
the italian firm of gio
ansaldo c
proposed a ship of <num> @,@ <num> long tons <num> @,@ <num> t standard displacement with nine <num> @-@ inch <num> mm guns in size and appearance similar to the italian battleship littorio then under construction by the company
the u
s
firm of gibbs cox provided four designs one for a conventional battleship and three hybrid designs which combined battleship main armament with a raised flight deck on the central superstructure capable of operating up to <num> aircraft
while these projects proved useful to the soviets they decided to proceed with their own designs
the first tactical @-@ technical requirement abbreviated in russian as ttz for the large battleship design was issued on <num> february <year> but proved too ambitious specifying nine <num> mm guns and a speed of <num> knots <num> km h <num> mph on a displacement of <num> @,@ <num> tons
the ttz was revised in may <year> by admiral orlov commander of the soviet navy reducing speed to <num> knots <num> km h <num> mph and weakening the secondary and anti @-@ aircraft batteries
a few months later admiral orlov further reduced the size of the battleship to <num> @,@ <num> tons and set the size of the main guns at <num> mm
shortly afterward the soviet union signed the anglo @-@ soviet quantitative naval agreement of <year> and agreed to follow the terms of the second london naval treaty that limited battleships to a displacement of <num> @,@ <num> metric tons <num> @,@ <num> long tons although they did add a proviso that allowed them to build ships of unlimited size to face the imperial japanese navy if they notified the british
yet another ttz was approved by orlov on <num> august for ships of <num> @,@ <num> tons with an armament of nine <num> @-@ millimeter twelve <num> @-@ millimeter <num>
<num> in twelve <num> @-@ millimeter <num>
<num> in and forty <num> @-@ millimeter <num>
<num> in guns a maximum armor thickness of <num> mm <num> in and a speed of <num> knots
the design of kb @-@ <num> the surface ship design bureau of the baltic shipyard was selected for further development although the lead designers were convinced that only a larger ship could fulfill the ambitious requirements
they did manage to get agreement on <num> november <year> for a thickening of the deck armor that raised the displacement to about <num> @,@ <num> tons
design work continued on this basis and technical work was completed for a ship of <num> @,@ <num> tons in april <year> but the designers continued to press their case for larger ships
the issue was resolved by premier stalin at a meeting on <num> july when he agreed to increase displacement to about <num> @,@ <num> tons
this forced the project to begin again
the timing of the redesign proved to be inauspicious as the great purge was spreading through the ranks of the military and related industries
the original deadline for completion of design work by <num> october was missed and an incomplete version was presented to the navy 's shipbuilding administration the next month
a number of details remained to be worked out including the final design of the machinery plant the <num> mm guns and the <num> mm gun mounts
in the meantime extensive and expensive testing was conducted on the ship 's hull form deck armor and torpedo protection <num> million rubles were spent on experimental work in <year> alone
over <num> models of the hull were tested in a ship model basin to find the best hull form and two one @-@ tenth @-@ scale launches were built at sevastopol to test the hull 's maneuverability
an old steamship was fitted with a replica of the design 's armor decks and tested against <num> @-@ kilogram <num> @,@ <num> lb bombs proving that such ordnance would generally penetrate both the <num> @-@ millimeter <num>
<num> in upper and <num> @-@ millimeter <num>
<num> in middle decks before exploding on the armored deck
the main armor deck was raised one deck in consequence and a splinter deck added underneath it to stop any bomb or shell fragments that might penetrate the armor deck
the underwater protection system was tested on fifteen one @-@ fifth scale models and two full @-@ sized experimental barges
these tests proved that the torpedo belt system of multiple bulkheads was superior to the pugliese system of a large tube filled with smaller sealed tubes but it was too late to incorporate these test results into the design as construction was well underway by the time they were completed in late <year>
a revised design was approved on <num> february <year> and the first ship was to be laid down on <num> july but even this design was incomplete and would be revised later
trials with similarly shaped motor launches suggested that the hull 's propulsive efficiency would be <num> knot <num>
<num> km h <num>
<num> mph less than planned and this was accepted in the november <year> revision as a maximum speed of <num>
<num> knots <num>
<num> km h <num>
<num> mph
however a new propeller design proved to be more efficient and was predicted to increase speed to <num> knots <num> km h <num> mph
another change was the deletion of the centerline rudder when tests showed that the two wing rudders would not be able to counteract its effects if it jammed
the weight toward the stern of the boat was calculated to be too great producing a substantial stern @-@ down trim
to remedy this the two <num> mm turrets mounted on the quarterdeck were deleted and the height of the armor belt abreast the rear turret was lowered but this decision was reversed and they were restored by a decision of the state defense committee on <num> january <year>
this forced a revision of the aircraft arrangements as the aircraft catapult had to be removed from the centerline of the quarterdeck two catapults were added to the sides of the quarterdeck instead
<num> meters <num> ft <num> in long overall
they had a beam of <num>
<num> meters <num> ft <num> in and at full load a draft of <num>
<num> meters <num> ft <num> in
they displaced <num> @,@ <num> metric tons <num> @,@ <num> long tons at standard load and <num> @,@ <num> metric tons <num> @,@ <num> long tons at full load although weight estimates made in <year> show that they would have exceeded <num> @,@ <num> metric tons <num> @,@ <num> long tons standard and <num> @,@ <num> metric tons <num> @,@ <num> long tons at full load
the hull form was very full @-@ bodied especially at the forward magazines where the torpedo protection system added width to the beam
coupled with the relatively low length @-@ to @-@ beam ratio of <num>
<num> <num> this meant that very powerful turbines were necessary to achieve even modest speeds
stalin 's decision that the project <num> @-@ class ships would use three shafts instead of four increased the load on each shaft and reduced propulsive efficiency although it did shorten the length of the armored citadel and thus overall displacement
metacentric height was designed at <num>
<num> meters <num> ft <num> in and the tactical diameter was estimated at about <num> @,@ <num> meters <num> @,@ <num> ft
the sovetsky soyuz @-@ class ships were provided with aircraft facilities to handle two to four kor @-@ <num> flying boats which would be launched by the two catapults mounted on the stern
two hangars were built into the after end of the forecastle deck to house two of them and cranes were provided at the forward end of the quarterdeck to hoist them out of the water
<num> meters <num>

the turbine compartments for the wing shafts were located forward of boiler room no
<num> and aft of the no
<num> turret magazines
the engine room for the center shaft 's turbine was between boiler room no
<num> and no
<num>
this meant that the wing propeller shafts had to run underneath the boilers
the steam turbines and a license to build them were originally going to be ordered from cammell laird in the united kingdom but their £ <num> @,@ <num> cost was more than the soviets wanted to pay
instead they bought them from brown boveri using the technical information acquired from cammell laird in the process for £ <num> @,@ <num>
four single @-@ reduction impulse @-@ reduction geared turbines were ordered from the swiss firm three to equip sovetskaya rossiya and one to serve as a pattern for the factory in kharkiv that was to build the remainder
the three produced a total of <num> @,@ <num> shaft horsepower <num> @,@ <num> kw
six triangle @-@ type water @-@ tube boilers — two in each boiler room — powered the turbines at a working pressure of <num> kg cm2 <num> @,@ <num> kpa <num> psi and a temperature of <num> ° c <num> ° f
maximum speed was estimated at <num> knots using the revised propeller design although forcing the machinery would yield an extra knot
the normal fuel oil capacity was <num> @,@ <num> metric tons <num> @,@ <num> long tons giving an estimated endurance of <num> @,@ <num> nautical miles <num> @,@ <num> km <num> @,@ <num> mi at <num>

the guns could be depressed to − <num> ° and elevated to <num> °
they had a fixed loading angle of <num> ° and their rate of fire varied with the time required to re @-@ aim the guns
it ranged from <num>
<num> to <num>
<num> rounds per minute depending on the elevation
the turrets could elevate at a rate of <num>

<num> rounds per gun were carried
the guns fired <num> @,@ <num> @-@ kilogram <num> @,@ <num> lb projectiles at a muzzle velocity of <num> m s <num> @,@ <num> ft s this provided a maximum range of <num> @,@ <num> meters <num> @,@ <num> yd
the secondary armament consisted of twelve <num> @-@ caliber b @-@ <num> <num> mm guns mounted in six dual mk @-@ <num> turrets
their elevation limits were − <num> ° to <num> ° with a fixed loading angle of <num> °
their rate of fire also varied with the elevation from <num>

they were provided with <num> rounds per gun
the turrets could elevate at a rate of <num> degrees per second and traverse at <num> degrees per second

heavy anti @-@ aircraft aa fire was provided by a dozen <num> @-@ caliber <num> mm b @-@ <num> dual @-@ purpose guns in six twin mz @-@ <num> turrets with <num> rounds per gun
the ships began construction with only four turrets but two additional turrets were restored to the quarterdeck in january <year>
they could elevate to a maximum of <num> ° and depress to − <num> °
they could traverse at a rate of <num> ° per second and elevate at <num> ° per second
they fired <num>
<num> @-@ kilogram <num> lb high explosive shells at a muzzle velocity of <num> m s <num> @,@ <num> ft s this provided a maximum range of <num> @,@ <num> meters <num> @,@ <num> yd against surface targets but their maximum range against aerial targets was <num> @,@ <num> meters <num> @,@ <num> ft the limit of their time fuse
light aa defense was handled by ten quadruple water @-@ cooled <num> @-@ k mounts fitted with <num> mm <num>
<num> in <num> @-@ k guns with <year> rounds per gun
initially only eight mounts were planned when the ships began construction but two more were added later probably in january <year> one on each side of the forward superstructure
each mount was fully enclosed to protect the crew from the muzzle blast of the larger guns and against splinters
the guns fired
<num> @-@ kilogram <num>
<num> lb shells at a muzzle velocity of <num> m s <num> @,@ <num> ft s
their effective anti @-@ aircraft range was <num> @,@ <num> meters <num> @,@ <num> ft
these had two <num> @-@ meter <num> ft <num> in stereoscopic rangefinders one to track the target and the other to measure the range to the ship 's own shell splashes
two of these were protected by <num> mm <num>
<num> in of armor and were mounted atop the rear superstructure and the tower @-@ mast
the other was mounted on top of the conning tower and was protected by <num> mm <num>
<num> in of armor
they used a tsas @-@ <num> mechanical computer to generate firing solutions
four kdp @-@ 4t @-@ ii directors with two <num> @-@ meter <num> ft <num> in rangefinders each controlled the secondary armament
one pair was on either side of the tower @-@ mast and the aft pair was on each side of the aft funnel
three spn @-@ <num> stabilized directors each with a <num> @-@ meter rangefinder controlled the heavy anti @-@ aircraft guns
there was one on each side of the forward funnel while the other was atop the rear superstructure
<num> in which forced the decision to replace cemented plates thicker than <num> mm <num>
<num> in with face @-@ hardened ones with less resistance in november <year>
the plants tended to compensate by making the thicker plates harder but this often made them more brittle and large numbers did not pass the acceptance tests
this would have significantly reduced the level of protection enjoyed by the sovetsky soyuz @-@ class ships in combat
the sovetsky soyuz @-@ class ships devoted a total weight of <num> @,@ <num> metric tons <num> @,@ <num> long tons to armor protection a slightly greater weight than that of the larger japanese yamato class <num> @,@ <num> metric tons <num> @,@ <num> long tons
their armor was intended to resist <num> mm shells and <num> kg bombs specifically shells fired from forward bearings between <num> ° and <num> ° from the centerline
this led to the very unusual situation where the armor belt thickened toward the bow to compensate for the narrowing of the ship near the forward magazines which had to be compensated for by thicker armor
the belt was <num>
<num> meters <num> ft <num> in long and covered <num> of the total waterline length

eight of these were to be laid down before <year> and the remaining six before <year>
however only four were actually laid down before the outbreak of world war ii forced the soviets to reassess their ambitious plans
on <num> october <year> an order was issued signed by stalin and molotov that no new battleships would be laid down in order to concentrate on smaller ships building and also probably because more resources were required for the army one ship is to be scrapped and priority should be given to only one of the three remaining battleships
the soviet shipbuilding and related industries proved to be incapable of supporting the construction of so many large ships at the same time
the largest warships built in the soviet union prior to <year> were the <num> @,@ <num> @-@ metric @-@ ton <num> @,@ <num> @-@ long @-@ ton kirov @-@ class cruisers and even they had suffered from a number of production problems but the soviet leadership appeared to ignore the difficulties encountered in the construction of the kirov class when ordering <num> much more ambitious ships
construction of two more ships planned for leningrad and nikolayev had to move to the brand @-@ new shipyard nr
<num> in molotovsk because the existing shipyards could not be expanded to handle so many large ships
components for these two ships had to be manufactured at leningrad and shipped via the white sea – baltic canal to molotovsk
also the turret shop at nikolaev proved to be too poorly equipped to assemble the <num> mm mountings and the propeller shafts had to be ordered in <year> from germany and the netherlands as the domestic plants were already overburdened with orders
shipbuilding steel proved to be in short supply in <year> and a number of batches were rejected because they did not meet specifications
armor plate production was even more problematic as only <num> @,@ <num> metric tons <num> @,@ <num> long tons of the anticipated <num> @,@ <num> metric tons <num> @,@ <num> long tons were delivered in <year> and more than half of that was rejected
furthermore the armor plants proved to be incapable of making cemented plates over <num> mm and inferior face @-@ hardened plates had to substitute for all thicknesses over <num> millimeters <num> in
machinery problems were likely to delay the ships well past their intended delivery dates of <year> – <num>
three turbines were delivered by brown boveri in <year> to arkhangelsk for the sovetskaya rossiya but the kharkhovskii turbogenerator works never completed a single turbine before the german invasion in june <year>
a prototype boiler was supposed to have been built ashore for evaluation but it was not completed until early <year> which further complicated the production plan
construction of all three ships was ordered halted on <num> july <year> and the sovetsky soyuz was placed into long @-@ term conservation as the most advanced ship
however all three were officially stricken from the navy list on <num> september <year>
<num> ordzhonikidze in leningrad although evidence suggests that construction actually began in january <year> after her slipway was completed the necessary cranes were in place and working drawings had been completed
when the war began she was estimated to be <num>
<num> complete with <num> @,@ <num> metric tons <num> @,@ <num> long tons of steel assembled on the slip
she was only lightly damaged by german air attacks and bombardments and as some material had been used during the siege of leningrad she was estimated to be <num>
<num> complete after the end of the war
some thought was given to completing her but this was opposed as she was regarded as obsolete in light of the experience gained during the war
stalin 's expressed desire to see one of the project <num> @-@ class ships completed only delayed the decision to scrap her this was ordered on <num> may <year> and was well underway by april <year>
<num> marti south in nikolayev
when the war began she was <num>
<num> complete with <num> @,@ <num> metric tons <num> @,@ <num> long tons assembled on the slipway
some effort was made to launch the hull but little work had been done to dredge the river at the foot of the slipway and she was captured on <num> august <year> although retreating soviet troops slightly damaged her hull
the germans dismantled <num> feet <num> m of her bow and <num> feet <num> m of her stern for use in fortifications
they were forced to evacuate nikolayev on <num> march <year> and demolished the supporting blocks under her port side before they left which gave her a list between <num> and <num> degrees and made her a total loss
she was ordered scrapped on <num> march <year>
<num> in molotovsk
after the end of the war she was only <num>
<num> complete with <num> @,@ <num> metric tons <num> @,@ <num> long tons of steel assembled
she was ordered scrapped on <num> march <year>
<num> in molotovsk but construction was suspended in mid @-@ <year> when it was discovered that <num> @,@ <num> rivets used in her hull plating were of inferior quality
this fact probably influenced the decision to cancel her on <num> october <year>
material intended for her construction was used to construct a floating battery for the defense of leningrad
it is a biopic of ahmad dahlan which describes how he came to found the islamic organisation muhammadiyah
sang pencerah produced to coincide with muhammadiyah 's centenary was announced in november <year>
it was meant to be historically accurate with much of the rp
<num> billion us <num>
<num> million budget paying for period costumes and sets
however as documentation on the early years of dahlan 's life is lacking those scenes were fictionalised
sang pencerah marks the feature film debut of ihsan tarore and giring ganesha
the film released on <num> september <year> during the eid ul @-@ fitr holiday was meant to show different views of islam however it has also been interpreted as a critique of the current muhammadiyah leadership
it was seen in theatres by over <num> million people – the only indonesian film of <year> to do so
it also received favourable critical reception winning the <year> bandung film festival after being refused a nomination at the <year> indonesian film festival
however some muslim critics decried it as being too liberal
displeased with the mixture of islam and animistic javanese mysticism which leads to poor javanese spending exorbitant amounts of money on religious ceremonies darwis decides to go on the hajj to mecca in saudi arabia
while there he studies what he considers the true form of islam over a period of five years
upon his return to yogyakarta darwis now played by lukman sardi changes his name to ahmad dahlan and begins teaching islam preaching that prayers need only come from inner peace and do not require large donations or sacrifices
conflict soon arises between dahlan and the local kyais religious leaders after he shows that the direction in which they pray is wrong pointing not to the kaaba in mecca but to africa
the kyais especially cholil kamaludiningrat slamet rahardjo decry dahlan as the leader of a cult and provoke a crowd of their followers to destroy the building next to dahlan 's house used for studying prayer
dahlan continues to preach and teach opening a school for native people teaching islam at a dutch @-@ run school and opening a small mosque he also marries his cousin siti walidah
his actions such as having his students sit on chairs instead of the traditional mats on the floor lead to kamaludiningrat decrying dahlan as an unbeliever who is working to westernise the local populace
despite continued resistance from kamaludiningrat dahlan prevails and furthers his teaching
together with walidah and the students dirjo abdurrahman arif fahrudin mario irwinsyah hisyam dennis adishwara sangidu ricky perdana and sudja giring ganesha he founds the progressive islamic organisation muhammadiyah which preaches islam without any influence from javanese mysticism
it was directed by hanung bramantyo a yogyakarta @-@ born muslim filmmaker
bramantyo who had previously directed the islamic @-@ themed ayat @-@ ayat cinta the verses of love <year> considered dahlan his favourite national hero he later told the jakarta post that he admired the kyai 's spirit
he also said that he had been wanting to make the film since he was a teenager
the film was meant to coincide with the <num> year anniversary of muhammadiyah 's founding
bramantyo attempted to make his film as historically accurate as possible
however as no documentation of dahlan 's life before he went to mecca exists the scenes showing dahlan 's youth were fictionalized
the script underwent <num> revisions before the film was completed
much of the film 's budget of rp
<num> billion us <num>
<num> million was spent on costumes and sets to ensure accuracy
the crew restored several old buildings for their shots and custom @-@ ordered <num> @-@ century style traditional garments for their scenes
bramatyo cast his wife zaskia adya mecca as ahmad dahlan 's wife siti walidah — mecca also served as casting director in charge of auditioning the supporting cast
before filming began mecca attempted to research the biographies of dahlan and his wife as she and the other young actors did not know much about the couple
however she found such research difficult as the libraries did not have the information she needed
lukman sardi who played dahlan was also unaware of his character 's historical biography before researching it he noted that he was not very confident in playing the role
indonesian idol winner ihsan tarore was cast as the young ahmad dahlan while the lead singer of the band nidji giring ganesha was cast as dahlan 's protege sudja it was the feature film debut for both
giring also wrote a song for the film titled allah maha suci allah the all @-@ pure over a period of two days
on set mecca who was pregnant at the time of shooting found her physical condition perfect for the role as walidah had been a large woman
however her pregnancy led to bramantyo worrying about a potential miscarriage during a scene where mecca had to ride a traditional carriage with wooden wheels which shook violently when moving
he meant for the film to show islam as being a peaceful and truthful religion
pramono writing for tempo notes that the film presents a different side of dahlan who is usually portrayed as an old bearded man who in his opinion seems neither modernist nor progressive
ahmad muttaqin a lecturer on comparative religious studies at sunan kalijaga islamic university in yogyakarta sees the film as a critique of the current muhammadiyah leadership whom he describes as narrow minded intolerant hav ing poor social respect
rigid and allergic to progress
according to bramantyo sang pencerah was seen by <num>
<num> million people while in theatres a report from the jakarta globe says <num>
<num> million
it was the only indonesian film of <year> to sell over a million tickets
bramatnyo was accused of working for muhammadiyah when creating the film an accusation which he denied
he also was criticised by some muslim groups which considered him too liberal
the film was not nominated for best picture at the <year> indonesian film festival after several nominees threatened to withdraw if sang pencerah was nominated
sang pencerah later won best picture at the bandung film festival held in bandung west java on <num> may <year>
triwik kurniasari reviewing for the jakarta post praised sardi and rahardjo 's acting noting that sang pencerah was a good film and a conduit for young people to learn about their national heroes
asep saefudin writing for antara himself a graduate from muhammadiyah schools viewed the film as being well put together and reflective of the issues faced by islamic modernists in the early <num>
pramono praised the film 's acting soundtrack and plot especially dahlan 's portrayal as a human with emotions and flaws instead of being perfect in every way
he found sang pencerah 's greatest weakness to be the language spoken by in some scenes as it mixed indonesian with javanese something not done during the period portrayed and the film 's stars – neither of whom is javanese – had inaccurate accents
the episode first aired in the united states on march <num> <year> on the fox network
the episode was written and directed by executive producer john shiban
the episode is a monster @-@ of @-@ the @-@ week episode a stand @-@ alone plot which is unconnected to the mythology or overarching fictional history of the x @-@ files
the episode earned a nielsen rating of <num>
<num> and was viewed by <num>
<num> million households and <num>
<num> million viewers
it received mixed reviews from critics
the show centers on fbi special agents who work on cases linked to the paranormal called x @-@ files this season focuses on the investigations of john doggett robert patrick monica reyes annabeth gish and dana scully gillian anderson
in this episode doggett is determined to find an error in the dna evidence that freed the convicted robert fassl the screwdriver killer whom he nearly caught in the act <num> years earlier
in the end it is revealed that fassl has a mental condition that splits him into two parts the religious innocent and the vengeful killer
underneath marked the directorial debut of shiban who had been a writer for the series for several seasons
reportedly the episode contained so many problems that the fox executives nearly refused to allow the finished product to air
at the last minute however they relented and allowed the episode to be aired later on in the season several weeks after its intended air date
shiban originally wanted to film the sewer scenes in los angeles actual sewer system but due to the events of september <num> a sewer mock @-@ up was built on stage <num> at the fox studios
earl brown sits in his van
he later approaches a home and claims to be there to repair the cable
as fassl holds up a piece of paper to show it to the family who called for the repair blood spatter splashes across the paper
he looks up and sees the house 's occupants with slit throats in pools of blood
abruptly two police officers burst into the house and apprehend fassl
one of the officers who goes to check out the kitchen turns to reveal he is john doggett robert patrick as a young nypd officer
in the present monica reyes annabeth gish discusses fassl 's release — due to dna evidence — with an outraged doggett
dana scully gillian anderson confirms that the test results conclusively disprove fassl as the killer
meanwhile in court fassl notices a mysterious bearded man
after being released he stays in a room belonging to his lawyer jana fain where he clutches a rosary beads and prays frantically
when the bearded man appears fassl begs for the man not to hurt her
while fain is unharmed fassl learns that the housekeeper mrs
dowdy has gone missing
fassl finds her body cleans up the blood and dismembers her remains to cover up what has happened
scully tells doggett that while the dna test disproves fassl 's culpability it implicates a possible blood relative fassl however is an only child
reyes proposes that the murders are being conducted by an entity rather than a person
meanwhile fassl approaches assistant district attorney damon kaylor and begs to be sent back to prison
kaylor refuses but is killed by the bearded man
after hearing of kaylor 's disappearance reyes theorizes that fassl 's piety and his unwillingness to acknowledge his darker half has given him the unwanted ability to physically change into another more violent person
the bearded man demands that fassl kill fain beating him up when he doesn 't comply
as she tends to fassl fain first sees the bearded man in his place
while staking out fain 's house the agents see the bearded man flee
doggett pursues the bearded man while reyes finds fain alive
in the pursuit reyes falls through into a sewer where she finds the remains of the bearded man 's victims
after a struggle with the bearded man doggett ends up apprehending fassl much to his confusion
reyes tries to remind him that it does not matter as long as the case is solved
this marked his directorial debut
according to shiban part of the inspiration for the episode was that the series production staff had actually talked for some time about doing a jekyll hyde story but never quite found a way to do it until the idea to use dna came into play
another inspiration for the episode was the <year> film the third man which featured a climactic chase through a sewage system
the episode which explores john doggett 's backstory as a new york city police officer was described as containing similar themes as those explored on the millennium series
the episode guest @-@ starred arthur nascarella who was a friend of series co @-@ star robert patrick
patrick was essential in getting nascarella cast on the show he later joked i stole nascarella 's new york accent in copland sic and i stole it to do the x @-@ files but i got him cast in the x @-@ files show
as the ninth season progressed and the show 's ratings began to plummet fox became more and more actively involved in the show 's style and direction
although underneath was the twelfth episode aired it was actually the ninth episode produced during the season reportedly the episode contained so many problems that the fox executives very nearly nixed the finished product
at the last minute however they relented and allowed the episode to be aired later on in the season several weeks after its intended air date
shiban originally wanted to film the sewer scenes in los angeles actual sewer system but the los angeles department of water and power vetoed the idea and stated that there 's a moratorium on shooting there since september <num> a position that shiban called understandable
in order to make up for this series art director corey kaplan was tasked with building a sewer replica she used the blueprints from the <year> version of les misérables as an inspiration
eventually a complete set was built on stage <num> at the fox studios
the episode later debuted in the united kingdom on february <num> <year> on bbc one
the episode earned a nielsen household rating of <num>
<num> meaning that it was seen by <num>
<num> of the nation 's estimated households and was viewed by <num>
<num> million households and over <num>
<num> million viewers
underneath was the 71st most watched episode of television that aired during the week ending march <num>
the episode received mixed reviews from television critics
jessica morgan from television without pity gave the episode a b – rating
john keegan from critical myth gave the episode a negative review and called it easily the worst of the season
he awarded it a <num> out of <num> and concluded that we can only hope that none of the remaining episodes are shiban @-@ related and pray that he can do a much better job when he writes for enterprise next season
robert shearman and lars pearson in their book wanting to believe a critical guide to the x @-@ files millennium the lone gunmen rated the episode three @-@ and @-@ a @-@ half stars out of five and called the entry solid and efficient
the two complimented shiban 's directorial efforts noting that as a director he makes underneath shine but were critical of some of the trademark x @-@ file moments citing the surprise appearance of a face in the bathroom mirror and the climactic fight in a sewer as examples
shearman and pearson however wrote positively of shiban 's realistic depiction of doggett

the name of the creek is derived from a salinan native american word slay or islay the name for the prunus ilicifolia wild cherries
around the time of the gold rush the area became an industrial hub and the condition of the creek worsened
after the devastating earthquake in <year> the city decided to reclaim the creek using earthquake debris reducing the waterbody to its present size
though much of islais creek has been converted to an underground culvert remnants still exist today at both glen canyon park and third street
several community organizations are dedicated to preserve these remnants as they are important wildlife habitats
<num> sq mi <num>
<num> km2 had two main branches
one originated near the southern slope of twin peaks slightly north of portola drive
it flowed downstream southeastward through the glen canyon park paralleling bosworth street and eventually reaching the bottom of the mission street viaduct at i @-@ <num>
the other branch began at the intersection of cayuga avenue and regent street
it flowed generally eastward along mission street and reached the i @-@ <num> viaduct
together as a wider creek it ran parallel to alemany boulevard and i @-@ <num> and emptied into the islais creek estuary near industrial street and oakdale avenue
precita creek a nearby creek that originated from noe valley also joined islais creek at the césar chávez boulevard and evans avenue intersection
from its sources in the glen canyon the entire creek stretched about <num>
<num> miles <num>
<num> km to the san francisco bay
the mouth was nearly <num> miles <num>
<num> km wide providing up to <num> of the drinking water in san francisco
due to urban development however the watershed of islais creek has been reduced by roughly <num> from its historical extent
a large number of neighborhoods in san francisco today such as bernal heights hunters point visitacion valley parts of the mission and potrero hill was once covered by the extent of the creek
in <year> the san francisco public utilities commission which manages the city 's water began investigating the possibility of daylighting underground portions of the creek
as of <year> remnants of the creek remain inside the glen canyon park and a <num> @-@ mile <num>
<num> km channel near third street where islais creek emptied into the bay
the name los islais first appeared on mexican maps in <year> named for the islay cherries that grew wildly in the area
by <year> water from the creek was used by farmers to irrigate crops
the gold rush marked the decline of the creek as large numbers of gold rushers swarmed into the city
a railroad trestle was built over the creek and tidal flats in the <num> and in a lawsuit that went up to the california supreme court called the people of the state of california ex relatione the board of state harbor commissioners vs
the potrero and bay view railroad company islais creek was declared a non @-@ navigable waterway in <year>
in <year> the area along the creek became known as the city ’ s new butchertown when more than <num> slaughterhouses opened
since then the condition of the creek deteriorated literally becoming a dumping place of garbage sewage animal waste and unsold meat products
the condition became so bad that the creek was commonly referred to as shit creek by san franciscans according to historian karl kortum
after the <year> earthquake san francisco board of supervisors voted to fill the creek with earthquake debris reducing the creek to its present size
during world war ii it served as docking areas for large ocean @-@ going tugs
the area also located the largest copra coconut processing plant in the united states west coast
in fact the abandoned five @-@ story high copra crane used to transport large amount of copras from ships to the plant as late as <year> still remains on the creek bank preserved as a historic landmark
in the <num> islais creek was home to the largest sardine canning industry in the world
the deteriorated condition of the creek gradually improved after the construction of a water treatment plant in <year>
today the majority of the creek is covered and transformed into a culvert with its remnants flowing at glen canyon and near the bay
many local community organizations were set up to improve the condition of the creek and nearby areas
friends of islais creek established back in <year> and david erickson a local community figure were committed to build a waterfront park in islais creek
the initial plan for a park was finally launched in <year> with a <num> @,@ <num> grant from the state department of water resources as well as community groups in the bayview
with an additional of <num> @,@ <num> federal and local grants as well as supports from non @-@ profit organizations and governmental agencies namely the sierra club san francisco municipal railway muni department of public works public utilities commission port of san francisco and caltrans the park was finished in <year>
located adjacent to pier <num> on the shores of the creek the muwekma ohlone park or the muwekma ohlone sanctuary is named after the native inhabitants and has since became an important habitat for a wide array of wildlife including the pacific chorus frog and mission blue butterfly
on november <num> <year> construction crews while preparing to drill an electrical conduit consisting of six large 115kv electrical cables across the creek for the muni metro t third street light rail line cracked the concrete sewer underground which carries more than <num> million gallons of sewage a day
the incident flooded the creek and its adjacent muwekma ohlone park with sewage
the park had to be excavated to make way for the repairing of the sewer pipe
it was estimated that it would take more than <num> @,@ <num> to repair and <num> @,@ <num> for wildlife habitat restoration
such overflow can cause a public health hazard as islais creek displays higher level of heavy metals pcbs bacteria as well as organochlorines than other parts of the san francisco bay
it is a bascule @-@ type drawbridge
the port of san francisco extended illinois street across islais creek in <year> to relieve traffic for third street
this crossing also uses a bascule bridge
while many species have been classified in the genus iguanodon dating from the late jurassic period to the late cretaceous period of asia europe and north america research in the first decade of the 21st century suggests that there is only one well @-@ substantiated species i
bernissartensis which lived from the late barremian to the earliest aptian ages early cretaceous in belgium and possibly elsewhere in europe between about <num> and <num> million years ago
iguanodon were large bulky herbivores
distinctive features include large thumb spikes which were possibly used for defense against predators combined with long prehensile fifth fingers able to forage for food
the genus was named in <year> by english geologist gideon mantell based on fossil specimens that are now assigned to therosaurus and mantellodon
iguanodon was the second type of dinosaur formally named based on fossil specimens after megalosaurus
together with megalosaurus and hylaeosaurus it was one of the three genera originally used to define dinosauria
the genus iguanodon belongs to the larger group iguanodontia along with the duck @-@ billed hadrosaurs
the taxonomy of this genus continues to be a topic of study as new species are named or long @-@ standing ones reassigned to other genera
scientific understanding of iguanodon has evolved over time as new information has been obtained from fossils
the numerous specimens of this genus including nearly complete skeletons from two well @-@ known bonebeds have allowed researchers to make informed hypotheses regarding many aspects of the living animal including feeding movement and social behaviour
as one of the first scientifically well @-@ known dinosaurs iguanodon has occupied a small but notable place in the public 's perception of dinosaurs its artistic representation changing significantly in response to new interpretations of its remains
the only well @-@ supported species i
bernissartensis is estimated to have weighed about <num>
<num> tonnes <num>
<num> tons on average and measured about <num> metres <num> feet long as an adult with some specimens possibly as long as <num> metres <num> feet
these animals had large tall but narrow skulls with toothless beaks probably covered with keratin and teeth like those of iguanas but much larger and more closely packed
the arms of i
bernissartensis were long up to <num> the length of the legs and robust with rather inflexible hands built so that the three central fingers could bear weight
the thumbs were conical spikes that stuck out away from the three main digits
in early restorations the spike was placed on the animal 's nose
later fossils revealed the true nature of the thumb spikes although their exact function is still debated
they could have been used for defense or for foraging for food
the little finger was elongated and dextrous and could have been used to manipulate objects
the phalangeal formula is <num> @-@ <num> @-@ <num> @-@ <num> @-@ <num> meaning that the innermost finger phalange has two bones the next has three etc
the legs were powerful but not built for running and each foot had three toes
the backbone and tail were supported and stiffened by ossified tendons which were tendons that turned to bone during life these rod @-@ like bones are usually omitted from skeletal mounts and drawings
iguanodon teeth are as the name suggests like those of an iguana but larger
unlike hadrosaurids which had columns of replacement teeth iguanodon only had one replacement tooth at a time for each position
the upper jaw held up to <num> teeth per side with none at the front of the jaw and the lower jaw <num> the numbers differ because teeth in the lower jaw are broader than those in the upper
because the tooth rows are deeply inset from the outside of the jaws and because of other anatomical details it is believed that as with most other ornithischians iguanodon had some sort of cheek @-@ like structure muscular or non @-@ muscular to retain food in the mouth
aside from iguanodon the best @-@ known members of the clade include dryosaurus camptosaurus ouranosaurus and the duck @-@ bills or hadrosaurs
in older sources iguanodontidae was shown as a distinct family
this family traditionally has been something of a wastebasket taxon including ornithopods that were neither hypsilophodontids or hadrosaurids
in practice animals like callovosaurus camptosaurus craspedodon kangnasaurus mochlodon muttaburrasaurus ouranosaurus and probactrosaurus were usually assigned to this family
with the advent of cladistic analyses iguanodontidae as traditionally construed was shown to be paraphyletic and these animals are recognised to fall at different points in relation to hadrosaurs on a cladogram instead of in a single distinct clade
essentially the modern concept of iguanodontidae currently includes only iguanodon
groups like iguanodontoidea are still used as unranked clades in the scientific literature though many traditional iguanodontids are now included in the superfamily hadrosauroidea
iguanodon lies between camptosaurus and ouranosaurus in cladograms and is probably descended from a camptosaur @-@ like animal
at one point jack horner suggested based mostly on skull features that hadrosaurids actually formed two more distantly related groups with iguanodon on the line to the flat @-@ headed hadrosaurines and ouranosaurus on the line to the crested lambeosaurines but his proposal has been rejected
the cladogram below follows an analysis by andrew mcdonald <year>
as mantell noted the remains he was working with were unlike any modern reptile especially in the toothless scoop @-@ shaped form of the lower jaw symphysis which he found best compared to that of the two @-@ toed sloth and the extinct ground sloth mylodon
he also suggested that iguanodon had a prehensile tongue which could be used to gather food like a giraffe
more complete remains have shown this to be an error for example the hyoid bones that supported the tongue are heavily built implying a muscular non @-@ prehensile tongue used for moving food around in the mouth
the giraffe @-@ tongue idea has also been incorrectly attributed to dollo via a broken lower jaw
the skull was structured in such a way that as it closed the bones holding the teeth in the upper jaw would bow out
this would cause the lower surfaces of the upper jaw teeth to rub against the upper surface of the lower jaw 's teeth grinding anything caught in between and providing an action that is the rough equivalent of mammalian chewing
because the teeth were always replaced the animal could have used this mechanism throughout its life and could eat tough plant material
additionally the front ends of the animal 's jaws were toothless and tipped with bony nodes both upper and lower providing a rough margin that was likely covered and lengthened by a keratinous material to form a cropping beak for biting off twigs and shoots
its food gathering would have been aided by its flexible little finger which could have been used to manipulate objects unlike the other fingers
exactly what iguanodon ate with its well @-@ developed jaws is not known
the size of the larger species such as i
bernissartensis would have allowed them access to food from ground level to tree foliage at <num> – <num> metres <num> – <num> ft high
a diet of horsetails cycads and conifers was suggested by david norman although iguanodonts in general have been tied to the advance of angiosperm plants in the cretaceous due to the dinosaurs inferred low browsing habits
angiosperm growth according to this hypothesis would have been encouraged by iguanodont feeding because gymnosperms would be removed allowing more space for the weed @-@ like early angiosperms to grow
the evidence is not conclusive though
whatever its exact diet due to its size and abundance iguanodon is regarded as a dominant medium to large herbivore for its ecological communities
in england this included the small predator aristosuchus larger predators eotyrannus baryonyx and neovenator low @-@ feeding herbivores hypsilophodon and valdosaurus fellow iguanodontid mantellisaurus the armoured herbivore polacanthus and sauropods like pelorosaurus
iguanodon was initially portrayed as a quadrupedal horn @-@ nosed beast
however as more bones were discovered mantell observed that the forelimbs were much smaller than the hindlimbs
his rival owen was of the opinion it was a stumpy creature with four pillar @-@ like legs
the job of overseeing the first lifesize reconstruction of dinosaurs was initially offered to mantell who declined due to poor health and owen 's vision subsequently formed the basis on which the sculptures took shape
its bipedal nature was revealed with the discovery of the bernissart skeletons
however it was depicted in an upright posture with the tail dragging along the ground acting as the third leg of a tripod
during his re @-@ examination of iguanodon david norman was able to show that this posture was unlikely because the long tail was stiffened with ossified tendons
to get the tripodal pose the tail would literally have to be broken
putting the animal in a horizontal posture makes many aspects of the arms and pectoral girdle more understandable
for example the hand is relatively immobile with the three central fingers grouped together bearing hoof @-@ like phalanges and able to hyperextend
this would have allowed them to bear weight
the wrist is also relatively immobile and the arms and shoulder bones robust
these features all suggest that the animal spent time on all fours
furthermore it appears that iguanodon became more quadrupedal as it got older and heavier juvenile i
bernissartensis have shorter arms than adults <num> of hindlimb length versus <num> for adults
when walking as a quadruped the animal 's hands would have been held so that the palms faced each other as shown by iguanodontian trackways and the anatomy of this genus 's arms and hands
the three toed pes foot of iguanodon was relatively long and when walking both the hand and the foot would have been used in a digitigrade fashion walking on the fingers and toes
the maximum speed of iguanodon has been estimated at <num> km h <num> mph which would have been as a biped it would not have been able to gallop as a quadruped
large three @-@ toed footprints are known in early cretaceous rocks of england particularly wealden beds on the isle of wight and these trace fossils were originally difficult to interpret
some authors associated them with dinosaurs early on
in <year> e
tagert went so far as to assign them to an ichnogenus he named iguanodon and samuel beckles noted in <year> that they looked like bird tracks but might have come from dinosaurs
the identity of the trackmakers was greatly clarified upon the discovery in <year> of the hind leg of a young iguanodon with distinctly three @-@ toed feet showing that such dinosaurs could have made the tracks
despite the lack of direct evidence these tracks are often attributed to iguanodon
a trackway in england shows what may be an iguanodon moving on all fours but the foot prints are poor making a direct connection difficult
tracks assigned to the ichnogenus iguanodon are known from locations including places in europe where the body fossil iguanodon is known to spitsbergen svalbard norway
although it was originally placed on the animal 's nose by mantell the complete bernissart specimens allowed dollo to place it correctly on the hand as a modified thumb
this would not be the last time a dinosaur 's modified thumb claw would be misinterpreted noasaurus baryonyx and megaraptor are examples since the <num> where an enlarged thumb claw was first put on the foot as in dromaeosaurids
this thumb is typically interpreted as a close @-@ quarter stiletto @-@ like weapon against predators although it could also have been used to break into seeds and fruits or against other iguanodon
one author has suggested that the spike was attached to a venom gland but this has not been accepted as the spike was not hollow nor were there any grooves on the spike for conducting venom
according to this interpretation at least three occasions of mortality are recorded and though numerous individuals would have died in a geologically short time span <num> – <num> years this does not necessarily mean these iguanodon were herding animals
an argument against herding is that juvenile remains are very uncommon at this site unlike modern cases with herd mortality
they more likely were the periodic victims of flash floods whose carcasses accumulated in a lake or marshy setting
the nehden find however with its greater span of individual ages more even mix of dollodon or mantellisaurus to iguanodon bernissartensis and confined geographic nature may record mortality of herding animals migrating through rivers
unlike other purported herding dinosaurs especially hadrosaurs and ceratopsids there is no evidence that iguanodon was sexually dimorphic with one sex appreciably different from the other
at one time it was suggested that the bernissart i
mantelli or i
atherfieldensis dollodon and mantellisaurus respectively represented a sex possibly female of the larger and more robust possibly male i
bernissartensis
however this is not supported today
two other individuals were observed with signs of osteoarthritis as evidenced by bone overgrowths in their anklebones which are called osteophytes
the story goes that gideon mantell 's wife mary ann discovered the first teeth of an iguanodon in the strata of tilgate forest in whitemans green cuckfield sussex england in <year> while her husband was visiting a patient
however there is no evidence that mantell took his wife with him while seeing patients
furthermore he admitted in <year> that he himself had found the teeth
not everyone agrees that the story is false though
it is known from his notebooks that mantell first acquired large fossil bones from the quarry at whitemans green in <year>
because also theropod teeth were found thus belonging to carnivores he at first interpreted these bones which he tried to combine into a partial skeleton as those of a giant crocodile
in <year> mantell mentioned the find of herbivorous teeth and began to consider the possibility that a large herbivorous reptile was present in the strata
however in his <year> publication fossils of the south downs he as yet did not dare to suggest a connection between the teeth and his very incomplete skeleton presuming that his finds presented two large forms one carnivorous an animal of the lizard tribe of enormous magnitude the other herbivorous
in may <year> he first presented the herbivorous teeth to the royal society of london but the members among them william buckland dismissed them as fish teeth or the incisors of a rhinoceros from a tertiary stratum
on <num> june <year> charles lyell showed some to georges cuvier during a soiree in paris but the famous french naturalist at once dismissed them as those of a rhinoceros
though the very next day cuvier retracted lyell reported only the dismissal to mantell who became rather diffident about the issue
in <year> buckland described megalosaurus and was on that occasion invited to visit mantell 's collection
seeing the bones on <num> march he agreed that these were of some giant saurian — though still denying it was a herbivore
emboldened nevertheless mantell again sent some teeth to cuvier who answered on <num> june <year> that he had determined that they were reptilian and quite possibly belonged to a giant herbivore
in a new edition that year of his recherches sur les ossemens fossiles cuvier admitted his earlier mistake leading to an immediate acceptance of mantell and his new saurian in scientific circles
mantell tried to corroborate his theory further by finding a modern @-@ day parallel among extant reptiles
in september <year> he visited the royal college of surgeons but at first failed to find comparable teeth
however assistant @-@ curator samuel stutchbury recognised that they resembled those of an iguana he had recently prepared albeit twenty times longer
in recognition of the resemblance of the teeth to those of the iguana mantell decided to name his new animal iguanodon or iguana @-@ tooth from iguana and the greek word ὀδών odon odontos or tooth
based on isometric scaling he estimated that the creature might have been up to <num> metres <num> feet long more than the <num> metres <num> feet length of megalosaurus
his initial idea for a name was iguana @-@ saurus iguana lizard but his friend william daniel conybeare suggested that that name was more applicable to the iguana itself so a better name would be iguanoides iguana @-@ like or iguanodon
he neglected to add a specific name to form a proper binomial but one was supplied in <year> by friedrich holl i
anglicum which was later amended to i
anglicus
mantell sent a letter detailing his discovery to the local portsmouth philosophical society in december <year> several weeks after settling on a name for the fossil creature
the letter was read to members of the society at a meeting on <num> december and a report was published in the hampshire telegraph the following monday <num> december which announced the name mis @-@ spelt as iguanadon
mantell formally published his findings on <num> february <year> when he presented a paper on the remains to the royal society of london
a more complete specimen of similar animal was discovered in a quarry in maidstone kent in <year> lower lower greensand formation which mantell soon acquired
he was led to identify it as an iguanodon based on its distinctive teeth
the maidstone slab was utilized in the first skeletal reconstructions and artistic renderings of iguanodon but due to its incompleteness mantell made some mistakes the most famous of which was the placement of what he thought was a horn on the nose
the discovery of much better specimens in later years revealed that the horn was actually a modified thumb
still encased in rock the maidstone skeleton is currently displayed at the natural history museum in london
the borough of maidstone commemorated this find by adding an iguanodon as a supporter to their coat of arms in <year>
this specimen has become linked with the name i
mantelli a species named in <year> by christian erich hermann von meyer in place of i
anglicus but it actually comes from a different formation than the original i
mantelli i
anglicus material
the maidstone specimen also known as gideon mantell 's mantel @-@ piece and formally labelled nhmuk <num> was subsequently excluded from iguanodon
it is classified as cf
mantellisaurus by mcdonald <year> as cf
mantellisaurus atherfieldensis by norman <year> and made the holotype of a separate species mantellodon carpenteri by paul <year>
at the same time tension began to build between mantell and richard owen an ambitious scientist with much better funding and society connections in the turbulent worlds of reform act – era british politics and science
owen a firm creationist opposed the early versions of evolutionary science transmutationism then being debated and used what he would soon coin as dinosaurs as a weapon in this conflict
with the paper describing dinosauria he scaled down dinosaurs from lengths of over <num> metres <num> feet determined that they were not simply giant lizards and put forward that they were advanced and mammal @-@ like characteristics given to them by god according to the understanding of the time they could not have been transmuted from reptiles to mammal @-@ like creatures
in <year> a few years before his death in <year> mantell realised that iguanodonts were not heavy pachyderm @-@ like animals as owen was putting forward but had slender forelimbs however his passing left him unable to participate in the creation of the crystal palace dinosaur sculptures and so owen 's vision of the dinosaurs became that seen by the public for decades
with benjamin waterhouse hawkins he had nearly two dozen lifesize sculptures of various prehistoric animals built out of concrete sculpted over a steel and brick framework two iguanodonts based on the mantellodon specimen one standing and one resting on its belly were included
before the sculpture of the standing iguanodont was completed he held a banquet for twenty inside it
with the encouragement of alphonse briart supervisor of mines at nearby morlanwelz louis de pauw on <num> may <year> started to excavate the skeletons and in <year> louis dollo reconstructed them
at least <num> iguanodon individuals were uncovered most of which were adults
in <year> the holotype specimen of i
bernissartensis became one of the first ever dinosaur skeletons mounted for display
it was put together in a chapel at the palace of charles of lorraine using a series of adjustable ropes attached to scaffolding so that a lifelike pose could be achieved during the mounting process
this specimen along with several others first opened for public viewing in an inner courtyard of the palace in july <year>
in <year> they were moved to the royal museum of natural history where they are still on display nine are displayed as standing mounts and nineteen more are still in the museum 's basement
the exhibit makes an impressive display in the royal belgian institute of natural sciences in brussels
a replica of one of these is on display at the oxford university museum of natural history and at the sedgwick museum in cambridge
most of the remains were referred to a new species i
bernissartensis a larger and much more robust animal than the english remains had yet revealed but one specimen was referred to the nebulous gracile i
mantelli now dollodon bampingi
the skeletons were some of the first complete dinosaur skeletons known
found with the dinosaur skeletons were the remains of plants fish and other reptiles including the crocodyliform bernissartia
the science of conserving fossil remains was in its infancy and new techniques had to be improvised to deal with what soon became known as pyrite disease
crystalline pyrite in the bones was being oxidized to iron sulphate accompanied by an increase in volume that caused the remains to crack and crumble
when in the ground the bones were isolated by anoxic moist clay that prevented this from happening but when removed into the drier open air the natural chemical conversion began to occur
to limit this effect de pauw immediately in the mine @-@ gallery re @-@ covered the dug @-@ out fossils with wet clay sealing them with paper and plaster reinforced by iron rings forming in total about six hundred transportable blocks with a combined weight of a hundred and thirty tons
in brussels after opening the plaster he impregnated the bones with boiling gelatine mixed with oil of cloves as a preservative
removing most of the visible pyrite he then hardened them with hide glue finishing with a final layer of tin foil
damage was repaired with papier @-@ mâché
this treatment had the unintended effect of sealing in moisture and extending the period of damage
in <year> museum director victor van straelen decided that the specimens had to be completely restored again to safeguard their preservation
from december <year> to august <year> the staff at the museum in brussels treated the problem with a combination of alcohol arsenic and <num> kilograms of shellac
this combination was intended to simultaneously penetrate the fossils with alcohol prevent the development of mold with arsenic and harden them with shellac
the fossils entered a third round of conservation from <year> until may <year> when the shellac hide glue and gelatine were removed and impregnated with polyvinyl acetate and cyanoacrylate and epoxy glues
modern treatments of this problem typically involve either monitoring the humidity of fossil storage or for fresh specimens preparing a special coating of polyethylene glycol that is then heated in a vacuum pump so that moisture is immediately removed and pore spaces are infiltrated with polyethelene glycol to seal and strengthen the fossil
dollo 's specimens allowed him to show that owen 's prehistoric pachyderms were not correct for iguanodon
he instead modelled the skeletal mounts after the cassowary and wallaby and put the spike that had been on the nose firmly on the thumb
he was not completely correct but he also had the disadvantage of being faced with some of the first complete dinosaur remains
a problem that was later recognised was the bend he introduced into the tail
this organ was more or less straight as shown by the skeletons he was excavating and the presence of ossified tendons
in fact to get the bend in the tail for a more wallaby or kangaroo @-@ like posture the tail would have had to be broken
with its correct straight tail and back the animal would have walked with its body held horizontal to the ground arms in place to support the body if needed
excavations at the quarry were stopped in <year> although it was not exhausted of fossils as recent drilling operations have shown
during world war i when the town was occupied by german forces preparations were made to reopen the mine for palaeontology and otto jaekel was sent from berlin to supervise
the allies recaptured bernissart just as the first fossiliferous layer was about to be uncovered
further attempts to reopen the mine were hindered by financial problems and were stopped altogether in <year> when the mine flooded
a new species that would become the subject of much study and taxonomic controversy i
atherfieldensis was named in <year> by r
w
hooley for a specimen collected at atherfield point on the isle of wight
iguanodon was recorded from africa based on teeth from tunisia and elsewhere in the sahara but the description of lurdusaurus and ouranosaurus cast doubt on african records of iguanodon
the genus was also recorded from mongolia based on the description of i
orientalis and in north america based on i
ottingeri from utah
another north american species from south dakota once assigned to iguanodon as i
lakotaensis has since been reclassified as the genus dakotadon
iguanodon was not part of the initial work of the dinosaur renaissance that began with the description of deinonychus in <year> but it was not neglected for long
david b
weishampel 's work on ornithopod feeding mechanisms provided a better understanding of how it fed and david b
norman 's work on numerous aspects of the genus has made it one of the best @-@ known dinosaurs
in addition a further find of numerous iguanodon skeletons in nehden nordrhein @-@ westphalen germany has provided evidence for gregariousness in this genus as the animals in this areally restricted find appear to have been killed by flash floods
at least <num> individuals from <num> to <num> metres <num>
<num> to <num>
<num> ft long have been found here although at least some of them are gracile iguanodontians and belong to the related mantellisaurus or dollodon described as i
atherfieldensis at that time believed to be another species of iguanodon
iguanodon material has also been used in the search for dinosaur dna and other biomolecules
in research by graham embery et al
iguanodon bones were processed to look for remnant proteins
in this research identifiable remains of typical bone proteins such as phosphoproteins and proteoglycans were found in a rib
while never becoming the wastebasket taxon several other early genera of dinosaurs became such as megalosaurus iguanodon has had a complicated history and its taxonomy continues to undergo revisions
although gregory paul recommended restricting i
bernissartensis to the famous sample from bernissart ornithopod workers like norman and mcdonald have disagreed with paul 's recommendations except exercising caution when accepting records of iguanodon from france and spain as valid
i
anglicus was the original type species but the holotype was based on a single tooth and only partial remains of the species have been recovered since
in march <year> the international commission on zoological nomenclature changed the type species to the much better known i
bernissartensis with the new holotype being irsnb <year>
the original iguanodon tooth is held at te papa tongarewa the national museum of new zealand in wellington although it is not on display
the fossil arrived in new zealand following the move of gideon mantell 's son walter there after the elder mantell 's death his fossils went to walter
i
bernissartensis described by george albert boulenger in <year> is the type species for the genus
this species is best known for the many skeletons discovered in bernissart but is also known from remains across europe
david norman suggested that it includes the dubious mongolian i
orientalis but this has not been followed by other researchers
i
galvensis described in <year> is based on adult and juvenile remains found in barremian @-@ age deposits in teruel spain
hoggi also spelled i
boggii or hoggii named by owen for a lower jaw from the tithonian – berriasian @-@ age upper jurassic – lower cretaceous purbeck beds of dorset in <year> has been reassigned to its own genus owenodon
iguanodon albinus or albisaurus scutifer described by czech palaeontologist antonin fritsch in <year> is a dubious nondinosaurian reptile now known as albisaurus albinus
i
atherfieldensis described by r
w
hooley in <year> was smaller and less robust than i
bernissartensis with longer neural spines
it was renamed mantellisaurus atherfieldensis in <year>
the bernissart specimen rbins <year> was described as dollodon bampingi in <year> but mcdonald and norman returned dollodon to synonymy with mantellisaurus
i
exogyrarum was described by fritsch in <year>
it is a nomen dubium based on very poor material and was renamed ponerosteus in <year>
i
prestwichii also spelled i
prestwichi described by john hulke in <year> has been reassigned to camptosaurus prestwichii or to its own genus cumnoria
two species described by richard lydekker in the late <num> century have been reassigned to different genera
i
dawsoni described by lydekker in <year> is known from two partial skeletons found in east sussex england from the middle valanginian @-@ age lower cretaceous wadhurst clay
it is now the type species of barilium
i
fittoni was described by lydekker in <year>
like i
dawsoni this species was described from the wadhurst clay of east sussex
it is now the type species of hypselospinus
i
hollingtoniensis also spelled i
hollingtonensis described by lydekker in <year> has variously been considered a synonym of hypselospinus fittoni or a distinct species assigned to the genus huxleysaurus
a specimen from the valanginian wadhurst clay formation variously assigned to i
hollingtoniensis and i
mantelli over the years has an unusual combination of hadrosaurid @-@ like lower jaw and very robust forelimb norman <year> assigned this specimen to the species hypselospinus fittoni while paul <year> made it the holotype of a separate species darwinsaurus evolutionis
i
seelyi also incorrectly spelled i
seeleyi described by hulke two years after i
prestwichii has been synonymised with iguanodon bernissartensis though this is controversial
i
suessii described by emanuel bunzel in <year> has been reassigned to mochlodon suessi
i
lakotaensis was described by david b
weishampel and philip r
bjork in <year>
the only well @-@ accepted north american species of iguanodon i
lakotaensis was described from a partial skull from the barremian @-@ age lower cretaceous lakota formation of south dakota
its assignment has been controversial
some researchers suggest that it was more basal than i
bernissartensis and related to theiophytalia but david norman has suggested that it was a synonym of i
bernissartensis
gregory s
paul has since given the species its own genus dakotadon
iguanodon mantelli described by christian erich hermann von meyer in <year> was based on the same material as i
anglicus and is an objective junior synonym of the latter
several taxa including the holotype of dollodon and mantellodon but also the dubious hadrosauroid trachodon cantabrigiensis the hypsilophodont hypsilophodon and valdosaurus were previously mis @-@ assigned to i
mantelli
i
hilli coined by edwin tully newton in <year> for a tooth from the early cenomanian upper cretaceous lower chalk of hertfordshire has been considered an early hadrosaurid of some sort
however recent work places it as indeterminate beyond hadrosauroidea outside hadrosauridae
i
orientalis described by a
k
rozhdestvensky in <year> was based on poor material but a skull with a distinctive arched snout that had been assigned to it was renamed altirhinus kurzanovi in <year>
at the same time i
orientalis was considered to be a nomen dubium because it cannot be compared to i
bernissartensis
harry seeley described i
phillipsi in <year> but later reassigned it to priodontognathus
i
praecursor also spelled i
precursor described by e
sauvage in <year> from teeth from an unnamed kimmeridgian late jurassic formation in pas @-@ de @-@ calais france is actually a sauropod sometimes assigned to neosodon although the two come from different formations
i
mongolensis whitfield <year> is a nomen nudum from a photo caption in a book of remains that would later be named altirhinus
delapparentia turolensis was named in <year> based on a specimen previously assigned to iguanodon bernissartensis
valdensis a renaming of vectisaurus valdensis by ernst van den broeck in <year>
originally named vectisaurus valdensis by hulke in <year> based on vertebral and pelvic remains it was from the barremian stage of the isle of wight
it was considered a juvenile specimen of mantellisaurus atherfieldensis or an undetermined species of mantellisaurus but is indeterminate beyond iguanodontia
i
foxii also spelled i
foxi was originally described by thomas henry huxley in <year> as the type species of hypsilophodon owen <year> or <year> reassigned it to iguanodon but his assignment was soon overturned
i
gracilis named by lydekker in <year> as the type species of sphenospondylus and assigned to iguanodon in <year> by rodney steel has been tossed of as a synonym of mantellisaurus atherfieldensis but is dubious nowadays
i
major a species named by justin delair in <year> based on vertebrae from the isle of wight and sussex originally described by owen in <year> as a species of streptospondylus s
major is a nomen dubium which is now thought to be a synonym of i
anglicus although it may be its own species
the nomen nudum proiguanodon van den broeck <year> also belongs here
anglicus described by friedrich holl in <year> is the original type species of iguanodon but as discussed above was replaced by i
bernissartensis
in the past it has been spelled as i
angelicus lessem and glut <year> and i
anglicum holl <year> emend
bronn <year>
it is known from teeth from the middle valanginian @-@ age lower cretaceous grinstead clay formation of cuckfield west sussex england
it is currently classified in the genus therosaurus as t
anglicus
i
ottingeri described by peter galton and james a
jensen in <year> is a nomen dubium based on teeth from the possibly aptian @-@ age lower cedar mountain formation of utah
the genera iguanosaurus ritgen <year> hikanodon keferstein <year> and therosaurus fitzinger <year> are simply junior objective synonyms later names for the material of i
anglicus
two lifesize reconstructions of mantellodon considered iguanodon at the time built at the crystal palace in london in <year> greatly contributed to the popularity of the genus
their thumb spikes were mistaken for horns and they were depicted as elephant @-@ like quadrupeds yet this was the first time an attempt was made at constructing full @-@ size dinosaur models
in <year> heinrich harder portrayed a group of iguanodon in the classic german collecting cards about extinct and prehistoric animals tiere der urwelt
several motion pictures have featured iguanodon
in the disney film dinosaur an iguanodon named aladar served as the protagonist with three other iguanodonts as other main characters a loosely related ride of the same name at disney 's animal kingdom is based around bringing an iguanodon back to the present
iguanodon is one of the three dinosaur genera that inspired godzilla the other two were tyrannosaurus and stegosaurus
iguanodon has also made appearances in some of the many land before time films as well as episodes of the television series
aside from appearances in movies iguanodon has also been featured on the television documentary miniseries walking with dinosaurs <year> produced by the bbc and played a starring role in sir arthur conan doyle 's book the lost world as well as featuring in an episode of the discovery channel documentary dinosaur planet incorrectly portrayed being able to run on all fours and living in the late cretaceous
it also was present in bob bakker 's raptor red <year> as a utahraptor prey item
a main belt asteroid <year> cb3 has been named <num> iguanodon in honour of the genus
because it is both one of the first dinosaurs described and one of the best @-@ known dinosaurs iguanodon has been well @-@ placed as a barometer of changing public and scientific perceptions on dinosaurs
its reconstructions have gone through three stages the elephantine quadrupedal horn @-@ snouted reptile satisfied the victorians then a bipedal but still fundamentally reptilian animal using its tail to prop itself up dominated the early <num> century but was slowly overturned during the <num> by its current more agile and dynamic representation able to shift from two legs to all fours
it developed from a previously non @-@ tropical cyclone in the western atlantic ocean and initially it moved northeastward off of the carolinas
the storm turned southwestward due to a building ridge and concurrently it intensified to become subtropical storm alpha
it later moved ashore near savannah and it finally dissipated in the northeast gulf of mexico on may <num>
it produced wave action and moderate rainfall along the coast
damage totaled over <num> @,@ <num> <year> usd and there were two associated deaths
in the third week of the month an upper @-@ level cutoff low developed along one of these troughs located southeast of the united states and removed from the westerlies
the origins of alpha were from a surface low northeast of florida associated with the larger @-@ scale cold core upper low
it organized and late on may <num> it could be classified as a subtropical depression east of the georgia south carolina border
while southeast of hatteras north carolina a developing ridge blocked its northeast motion and so it slowed to turn to the southeast
on may <num> a small intense low @-@ level center organized rapidly and by the next day it attained gale force winds by which time the storm turned southwestward
at <year> utc on may <num> the national hurricane center initiated advisories on subtropical cyclone alpha when the storm was about <num> miles south of cape hatteras
around that time it reached its peak winds of <num> mph <num> km h
on its first advisory there was disagreement among forecast models regarding its eventual track with projected tracks deviating from a georgia landfall to a track northeastward out to sea
alpha was also a climatological outlier at the time the nhc hurran model which was based on previous storms with similar characteristics found no analogs for the storm
subtropical storm alpha was initially well @-@ defined as it moved southwestward
the very small center was located along the eastern edge of the convection while low @-@ level cloud bands formed east of the center
at the time the temperature structure was more typical of a winter storm although it was expected to become more like a subtropical storm typical during the summer months
the winds decreased steadily as it turned more westward on may <num> and the heavy rainfall persisted mostly to the north and west of the center
the national hurricane center initially thought the center might not have been at the surface and the agency indicated low forecasting confidence as they could not determine a circulation center
the difficulty arose from the large sprawling nature of the storm and by later on may <num> a new center formed as confirmed by radar imagery and the hurricane hunters
that night the extremely small center made landfall just south of savannah georgia affecting a very small area with winds of <num> mph <num> km h and a minimum pressure of <num> mbar hpa <num>
<num> inhg
around the time of landfall alpha developed a warm core indicating some tropical characteristics
the storm weakened quickly over land although it did not dissipate until two days later over the northeast gulf of mexico
gale warnings were posted from cape fear north carolina to chincoteague virginia
the interaction between alpha and the high pressure system to its northeast caused cooler temperatures and gusty winds from delaware southward
wave heights reached up to <num> feet <num>
<num> m along the virginia capes
the storm dropped rainfall along the coast of north carolina and virginia with a maximum of <num>
<num> inches <num> mm reported in ocracoke north carolina
while moving slowly off the north carolina coast alpha caused heavy beach erosion destroyed one house and threatened the foundation of several other homes in the outer banks
damage totaled over <num> @,@ <num> <year> usd
while the storm was traveling over the western atlantic ocean the storm produced a large area of rough seas which was considered the greatest threat from the storm
in northeastern florida police officers were stationed to ensure people did not swim in the dangerous seas
the high waves also halted work to deepen a harbor at the mayport naval station
two people drowned after the storm dissipated when surf was still turbulent
tides along the georgia coast reached <num> to <num> feet <num>
<num> to <num>
<num> m above normal which caused some flooding and beach erosion
wind gusts reached <num> mph <num> km h on saint simons island
the winds knocked down trees and power lines leaving some people without power in eastern georgia
damage was minor but widespread in the state estimated at over <num> @,@ <num> <year> usd
moderate rains spread in coastal areas from south carolina through southern florida
the <year> hurricane season was the first year in which quasi @-@ tropical cyclones were named by using the nato phonetic alphabet
at the time the names were applied to large subtropical cyclones and small neutercanes both of which were later combined into one category
it was also released as axe of rage in north america
the game is the sequel to barbarian the ultimate warrior death sword in north america which was published in <year>
in barbarian ii the player controls a princess or barbarian character exploring the game world to locate and defeat an evil wizard
the game 's plot is an extension of its predecessor although the gameplay is different
while the first game offers two players the opportunity for virtual head @-@ to @-@ head combat the second is solely a single @-@ player adventure with fewer fighting moves
palace software the developer of the two barbarian games marketed the sequel with the same strategy they used for the first game
they hired maria whittaker a model known for her topless work to pose on the cover and posters as the princess in the game attempting to recapture the controversy that had boosted sales
barbarian ii received a mixed critical reception
reviewers were split in their opinions over whether the game was a refreshing and gory adventure or a boring and lonely sojourn through a confusing digital world
it is the sequel to barbarian the ultimate warrior released in <year> which offers sword fighting action to one or two players
unlike its predecessor barbarian ii features only a single @-@ player mode in which the player assumes the role of either sword @-@ wielding princess mariana or the titular savage who is armed with a battleaxe
their common quest is to pursue the evil wizard drax who has fled to his dungeon hideout after his defeat in the first game
the player characters battle their way through an inhospitable wasteland a system of caves and a dungeon before facing drax in his inner sanctum for a showdown
using a joystick or keyboard the player moves his or her character through barbarian ii 's world
each of the four stages — wasteland caves dungeon and inner sanctum — is a series of interconnected rooms populated by monsters traps and items
the game displays one room at a time in a flick @-@ screen manner as the protagonist leaves a room the screen is updated to display the next
the connections among rooms are disjointed the exit on the left of one room might be connected to the entrance on the same side of another
a compass at the bottom of the interface serves as a directional guide always pointing to the north
the player directs his or her player through the rooms seeking the exit to the next stage while avoiding traps and collecting items
the protagonist is also challenged in his or her quest by <num> types of creatures
by moving the joystick while pressing its button or by performing the equivalent keyboard commands the player defends the protagonist with four styles of attacks a low slash a high chop a kick and a spinning neck chop
the life of the combatants are represented by gauges at the top corners of the screen
successful attacks on a character reduce its gauge and the character is killed when its life is reduced to zero
a well @-@ timed neck chop or the bites of certain monsters decapitates the opponent killing it instantly
monsters disappear in a puff of smoke when killed reappearing with a full life gauge in the same room some time later
although the player character likewise reappears fully rejuvenated in the room after being killed he or she can only do so for a limited number of times
this limit number of lives is represented in the form of globes at the top centre of the screen
the protagonist increases his or her number of lives by collecting skulls that are scattered throughout the game world
reviewers enjoyed the game 's exciting sword fights and its profile was greatly enhanced by marketing strategies employed by its developer palace software a subsidiary of media company palace group
the developer had engaged maria whittaker a model known for topless shoots to pose on the box covers and posters of the game
the image of bikini @-@ clad whittaker created a hype that pushed the game beyond the attention of the video game industry producing a controversy in which members of the public criticised the industry for promoting barbarian in a sexist manner
palace software repeated the strategy for the sequel publishing a poster of whittaker as princess mariana this time in metal bikini armour and michael van wijk as the barbarian
steve brown creator of the barbarian games recalled that the bikini 's chain snapped a number of times in comical carry on fashion during the shoot
brown was behind the concept of the poster which was brought to fruition by lee gibbons a commercial artist over the course of four weeks
the image of the barbarian and princess poised over the fallen body of a large scaly monster was a photomontage created by superimposing three photographs — one of each subject — on one another
the creature was a small scale model made of plasticine
after cutting out the subjects from their photos and composing the cut @-@ outs to form a new scene gibbons painted the background and added effects such as smoke to form the final image
brown had filmed sword fights and used the tracings of the combatants movements to produce the animations in barbarian
for the animations in the sequel he turned to the works of photographer eadweard muybridge who made a name for himself through his series of photographs of animals and humans captured in motion
the movements of barbarian ii 's characters were based on the pictures in muybridge 's book human in motion which was published in <year>
the resulting animation was judged very realistic and detailed by several reviewers
first released in august <year> for the commodore <num> barbarian ii was ported to various personal computers
the various versions differed in features depending on specifications of the platforms
the amiga version of the game was given several improvements
it has digitized speech and better graphics in the form of greater details and number of colours
the introductory and disc loading sequences were revamped featuring animated skeletons with maniacal voices
in contrast the zx spectrum version has monochromatic graphics the first level comprises black @-@ outlined sprites against pink backgrounds
as with its predecessor barbarian ii was licensed to epyx for release in north america
the game was published there under the title axe of rage and included a tattoo in its packaging
the north american version featured a different cover art showing the close @-@ up visage of a screaming berserker with homicidal tendencies
dragon magazine 's reviewers found the cover ugly and according to computer gaming world a canadian wholesaler refused to sell axe of rage because it considered the game 's box cover art crass enough to offend customers
similarly in the united kingdom pharmacy chain boots banned displays of barbarian ii featuring whittaker from their stores
reviewers of the games machine pointed out that the most remarkable feature of the st version is its crystal clear sampled effects
zzap <num> 's staff and computer and video games 's julian rignall were impressed with the digital thuds and whacks produced on the commodore <num> and particularly the rendition of a certain monster 's laughter
mike pattenden of cu amiga claimed the manic clucking of the mutant chicken would be enough to send the player running in the opposite direction
although rating the audio @-@ visual components of the amiga version on par with that for the atari st pattenden and reviewers from the game machine felt the flashy introductory sequence on the amiga made it stand out tony horgan of amiga user international called it the best introduction he has seen in amiga games
although reviewers were less than impressed with the graphics on lower @-@ end systems such as the zx spectrum the colours and large detailed sprites on the higher @-@ end platforms won their acclaim
the animation of the characters also captured their attention
tommy nash of your sinclair hailed it as first class while paul glancey of zzap <num> called the sprites beautifully defined and realistically animated
similar accolades were given by other reviewers
the staff of the games machine were constantly amazed at the designs of the monsters in the game
several reviewers had a common complaint about the game
as the difference between executing an attack and a movement was the pressing of the joystick button they were irked to find their characters frequently switching directions instead of attacking with a low slash
their frustration was increased when the protagonist took damage from enemy attacks as he or she executes the unintentional command to change facing
chris jenkins however praised the game for responsive joystick controls in his review for sinclair user
paul lakin of zero pointed out that the flick @-@ screen presentation could lead to confusing situations in combat as the protagonist retreats across an exit and appears at the other end of the screen
horgan had another grouse with the combat moaning the loss of simplicity from the barbarian series
according to him while players could enjoy the first barbarian game without much effort intense practise was needed to defeat the monsters in the second game
the change in combat systems was not the only difference between barbarian ii and its predecessor that influenced reviewers opinions about the sequel
the first barbarian game was enjoyed by reviewers for providing exciting head @-@ to @-@ head action between two players
barbarian ii abandoned this setting up an adventuring experience for the single player
jim douglas reviewing for sinclair user doubted that players who were looking for quick action would appreciate plotting a path through the maze to reach the final goal
your sinclair 's marcus berkmann felt the two genres — slash em up and arcade adventure — were fundamentally incompatible agreeing with douglas that the maze was a distraction
crash 's reviewers however felt the combination of genres made the game interesting
james price wrote in amiga force that the adventuring element and unending number of enemies made barbarian ii a far better game than the first while the games machine 's staff said the expanded menagerie of foes adequately made up for a reduction in combat moves
in their review for dragon magazine the lessers called axe of rage an engrossing slash n hack that 'll please most arcaders
zzap <num> 's reviewers were unanimous in recommending barbarian ii to their readers however two years later in a re @-@ review the magazine 's staff said the game has aged badly finding the gameplay lot more crude and clichéd and of dubious replay value
martyn carroll concurred in his article for retro gamer <num> years after the game 's release calling barbarian ii hugely disappointing for messing up almost everything that was great about the first game
brown and palace software 's co @-@ founder richard leinfellner admitted as much they said they had mixed feelings about barbarian ii thinking the idea of a simple fun game was lost by stuffing too many features into it
when barbarian ii was released palace software went ahead with plans for barbarian iii
for two years the third game in the series was publicised in gaming magazines
your sinclair held a contest for its readers asking them to submit concepts of gruesome monsters
the winning entry would be implemented in barbarian iii
the barbarian series of games were however brought to a halt in <year> when palace group sold its software subsidiary to fund its expansion into the movie industry
titus software bought palace software and after reviewing its holdings cancelled several of its new acquisition 's projects including barbarian iii
it was first published in <year> in the united states by penguin group and in great britain by bloomsbury publishing

the police are notified and set a trap but the convict avoids the growing crowd of pursuers until he arrives at the theater
there the convict takes a pose under an advertisement and the pursuers understand it was all an advertising ploy they purchase tickets and go to see the film
the film was released on september <num> <year> it was the first part of a split @-@ reel production that included a husband 's jealous wife
the film was met with positive reviews though the film is presumed lost
it states the convict is discovered stealing along a country road glancing about for signs of danger
his stripes are discernible on that portion of his breast and on that portion of his trousers leg not covered by the long coat he wears which cannot conceal the stripes that tell all hence his keen watch for passersby
still he does not spy a nearby farmer until too late the cry prisoner loose is raised and a dozen rustics make after the unfortunate
convict meets accomplice who is waiting with carriage jumps in the carriage and the pair drives off
baffled pursuers come up sight a wagon all pile within and resume pursuit
convict jumps from carriage and drops behind boulder accomplice driving straight on with the wagon hot after him when the wagon has passed him by convict comes from behind boulder crosses road and disappears on other side but has been seen crossing the road by a small girl who kept out of sight until the convict had disappeared but who now rushes off to tell of her discovery
put back on the trail by the little girl pursuers follow their quarry to the waterside where a second accomplice awaits the convict with a rowboat and into which he jumps and pulls for the other side
another rowboat sets out in pursuit
one of the pursuers telephones constables on the other side of the water to catch convict when he tries to land
race of the rowboats
nearing shore the convict finds himself hemmed in pursuers on water and constables on land
luckily for him pursuers in their efforts to grab his boat overturn their own he gets to shore where the accomplice is caught though the convict escapes
constable and pursuer chase him to town road where third accomplice awaits with auto they speed off
an automobile too happens along allows pursuers to use his auto to chase convict 's and all enter except constable who rushes off to phone town police of convict 's coming
receiving the message chief of police leaves with coppers for town end of road across which they stretch rope and await convict 's auto
as the convict dashes down main street new pursuers spring up at every step
yet when he reaches the opera house he calmly walks into the entrance and facing his pursuers takes a dignified stand beside the billboard on which is printed latest moving picture today 's feature stung or the convict 's escape a roaring comedy now showing
he was an experienced newspaperman employed by the new york evening world while writing scripts for the thanhouser productions
the plot is a clever advertising scheme employed by a theatre manager to draw patrons and using an elaborate series of events in order to accomplish that effect
once the convict is identified and the chase begins he receives assistance in prolonging the chase until arriving at the theatre where the crowd purchases tickets for the show
the film director is unknown but it may have been barry o 'neil
film historian q
david bowers does not attribute a cameraman for this production but at least two possible candidates exist
blair smith was the first cameraman of the thanhouser company but he was soon joined by carl louis gregory who had years of experience as a still and motion picture photographer
the role of the cameraman was uncredited in <year> productions
the only role in the cast which is known is for marie eline as the little girl
the other cast credits are unknown but many <year> thanhouser productions are fragmentary
a surviving film still gives the possibility of identifying two actors
advertising for the film was a bit mixed as to whether or not it was a comedy or a drama stating you have no idea as to how marvelously a thanhouser can twist a story until you see this gripping dra well perhaps it isn 't a drama at that or a comedy even
we hate to tip you off as to what it is
when you see the picture with its totally unlooked @-@ for climax you 'll know why bowers would later term this as more of the slapstick comedy that edwin thanhouser said the company would not produce
the film likely had a wide national release known advertising theatres include indiana and kansas
the film was also shown in vancouver canada
one theater advertisement may have confused this film with another because it lists this film as a western film
reviews for the film were positive and focused on the novel methods used to attract the audience to the theater
the moving picture world stated a burlesque picture which becomes more thrilling as it proceeds
the convict is supposed to have escaped and the way he is chased and surrounded bodes no good for him
but somehow he manages to elude the steadily increasing army of pursuers until they are gathered around him when he calmly shows a motion picture announcement and the reason for all this melee in which the whole countryside took part becomes apparent
the requirement that the fleeing convict be continually assisted as a part of the plot may have been lost on the new york dramatic mirror reviewer
the reviewer writes perhaps in real life things might not happen so luckily for the convict unless the carriage the boat and the automobile were previously arranged for him
even then fate might conceivably have some disagreeable card up her sleeve
in the film at any rate everybody bit nicely
they pursued the escaped convict in increasing crowds until he led them to the theatre he was advertising
there they all obligingly bought tickets to the show and no doubt enjoyed it hugely
they did if it was as good as the film is
the least interesting sections of the film are the telephone messages exchanged by agitated police officials but they set off the livelier adventures of the convict with agreeable contrast
walton of the moving picture news identified the set up and assistance to the convict and states in spite of the thanhouser folk joining in the racket and the peculiar readiness of carriage and automobile and boat to help the gentleman in a costume not used in this state for some two years the audience did not catch on
when the revelation came at the door of the new rochelle picture show the theatre rang with laughter
we were all stung and we enjoyed it
the fia is also the governing body for formula one and other international motorsports
a qualified barrister and former amateur racing driver mosley was a founder and co @-@ owner of march engineering a successful racing car constructor and formula one racing team
he dealt with legal and commercial matters for the company between <year> and <year> and became its representative at the formula one constructors association foca the body that represents formula one constructors

the flash and circle was used by both the um and the pre @-@ war buf
he also says mosley organised a couple of large parties as a way to get in with lively ordinary normal young people girls as well as boys and attract them to the movement by showing that we were like them and didn 't go on about hitler and mussolini franco and british fascism all the time
mosley met his future wife jean at such a party
mosley and alexander were photographed posing as teddy boys in notting hill during the <year> race riots between afro @-@ caribbeans and local white gangs of teddy boys
the following year they canvassed for their father when he ran as a union movement candidate for the nearby kensington north seat in the <year> general election
mosley has rarely discussed his early political involvement with his father
when his father oswald died the london daily mail described him as a much maligned and much misunderstood political giant of his era
certainly his father 's political presence affected his early years but mosley reflected on this time i was born into this rather strange family and then at a certain point you get away from that
whilst he has distanced himself from this period of his life the misunderstanding has remained and today
he carries that weight on his shoulders
in <year> mosley was an election agent for the union movement supporting walter hesketh as parliamentary candidate for moss side
the motor racing journalist alan henry describes him as one of his father 's right @-@ hand men at the time of a violent incident in <year> in which sir oswald was knocked down by a mob in london and saved from serious injury by his son 's intervention
as a result of his involvement in this fracas mosley was arrested and charged with threatening behaviour
he was later cleared at old street magistrates court on the grounds that he was trying to protect his father
by <year> when he began work as a barrister mosley was no longer involved in politics
in the early <num> mosley attempted a political career working for the uk conservative party and hoping to become a parliamentary candidate
bernie ecclestone 's biographer terry lovell writes that he gave up this aspiration after being unimpressed by the calibre of senior party officials
he also felt his name would be a handicap and has since said if i had a completely open choice in my life i would have chosen party politics but because of my name that 's impossible
by the late <num> he had become a supporter of the uk labour party following a meeting with then labour leader john smith
the circuit is not far from oxford and the couple went out of curiosity
mosley was attracted by the sport and when his career as a barrister was bringing in sufficient money he started racing cars himself
the sport 's indifference to his background appealed to mosley there was always a certain amount of trouble being the son of sir oswald until i came into motor racing
and in one of the first races i ever took part in there was a list of people when they put the practice times
and i heard somebody say mosley max mosley he must be some relation of alf mos e ley the coachbuilder
and i thought to myself i 've found a world where they don 't know about oswald mosley
and it has always been a bit like that in motor racing nobody gives a damn
at national level in the uk mosley competed in over <num> races in <year> and <year> he won <num> and set several class lap records
in <year> he formed the london racing team in partnership with driver chris lambert to compete in european formula two which at that time was the level of racing just below formula one
their cars were prepared by frank williams later a formula one team owner
it was a dangerous time to race
mosley 's first formula two race was the <year> deutschland trophäe at hockenheim in which double world champion jim clark was killed and within two years both of mosley 's <year> team mates piers courage and chris lambert were dead in racing accidents
mosley 's best result that year was an eighth place at a non @-@ championship race at monza
engine builder brian hart says that as a driver mosley might not have been particularly quick but he was a thinking driver
he kept out of trouble and generally used his head
he was already working with robin herd alan rees and graham coaker to establish the racing car manufacturer march engineering where he handled legal and commercial matters
the name march is an acronym based on the initials of the founders the m stands for mosley
like the other founders mosley put in £ <num> @,@ <num> of capital
his father told him that the company would certainly go bankrupt but it would be good training for something serious later on
mosley played a key role in publicising the new outfit
although march had few resources and limited experience the firm announced ambitious plans to enter formula one the pinnacle of single @-@ seater racing in <year>
the team had initially intended to enter a single car but by the beginning of the season partly due to deals made by mosley the number of march cars entered for their first formula one race had risen to five
two of these were run by march 's own in @-@ house works team and the rest by customer teams
mosley also negotiated sponsorship from tyre maker firestone and oil additive manufacturer stp
the new operation was initially successful
in formula one march cars won three of their first four races
one of these was a world championship race the <year> spanish grand prix won by reigning world champion jackie stewart in a customer car run by tyrrell racing
as a result march finished third in the <year> constructors championship
the factory also sold <num> cars to customers in various lower formulae
despite these successes the organisation got into financial difficulty almost immediately
the formula one operation was costing more than the customer car business was making
the march works team 's contract with its lead driver chris amon was expensive and mosley in his own words tried at every opportunity to get rid of him
he reasoned that stewart 's highly competitive customer car was enough to show march in a good light
amon stayed to the end of the year but mosley succeeded in restructuring his contract saving the company some much @-@ needed money
at the end of the season mosley successfully demanded full control of the finances including the factory run by coaker who left shortly afterwards
mosley and herd borrowed £ <num> @,@ <num> from relatives and friends to support the company into its second year
according to lovell the money came from mosley 's half @-@ brother jonathan guinness
tyrrell started making its own cars towards the end of <year> and march 's <year> program in formula one was much reduced with no recognised front @-@ running driver
the firestone and stp sponsorship was insufficient and mosley failed to attract a large backer for <year>
motorsport author mike lawrence has suggested that the shortfall forced him into short @-@ term deals which maintained cashflow but were not in the best long @-@ term interests of the company
mosley negotiated a deal for the team to use alfa romeo engines in a third car bringing much needed funding
the engines proved uncompetitive and his hopes of an ongoing partnership with the italian automobile manufacturer were not met
nonetheless march again finished third in the constructors championship and works driver ronnie peterson in a cosworth dfv @-@ powered car was second in the drivers championship
march 's financial woes continued the company had lost £ <num> @,@ <num> at the end of <year>
mosley and rees disagreed over how to rectify the situation and rees left march early in <year>
march was more successful in selling large numbers of customer cars in the lower formulae
mosley organised extensive test sessions for the <year> cars for journalists and drivers and arranged a successful scheme for drivers to rent cars and engines for the season rather than buying them outright
losing money on a deal to supply jochen neerpasch then motorsport manager at ford with a formula two car paid off when neerpasch moved to bmw and offered march an exclusive deal in <year> to use bmw 's formula two engine
march cars powered by bmw engines won five of the next <num> european formula two championships
however bmw also put pressure on herd to concentrate on the formula two programme
as a result he spent less time with the formula one team where mosley started to act as a race engineer
although march considered quitting formula one on several occasions money was always found to support at least one car
motorsport historian mike lawrence credits mosley with pressing for a six @-@ wheeled march to be built as a draw for sponsors having seen the popularity with fans of tyrrell 's six @-@ wheeled p34
the resulting march <num> @-@ <num> @-@ <num> never competed in formula one but generated the required publicity and a scalextric slotcar model was profitable
mosley spent much of his time negotiating deals for drivers with sponsorship and was also successful in selling marches to other formula one teams such as williams and penske
the cars were rarely frontrunners although the works team won a single race in both <year> and <year>
by the end of <year> mosley was fed up with the struggle to compete in formula one with no resources and left to work for foca full @-@ time selling his shares in the company to herd but remaining as a director
march 's involvement in formula one ended the same year
although the new march organisation was not popular with the established teams mosley has said that when they went along to meetings to discuss things such as prize money they felt they ought to take me along because i was a lawyer
he was unimpressed with the standard of negotiations our side all went in a group because no @-@ one trusted anyone else and all were afraid that someone would break ranks and make a private deal
in <year> british businessman bernie ecclestone bought the brabham team and mosley recalls that within about <num> minutes of ecclestone turning up at the gpca meeting it was apparent that here was someone who knew how many beans made five and after about half an hour he moved round the table to sit next to me and from then on he and i started operating as a team
within a very short time the two of us were doing everything for the gpca instead of everyone moving around in a block and from that developed foca
the formula one constructors association foca was created in <year> by ecclestone colin chapman teddy mayer mosley ken tyrrell and frank williams
foca would represent the commercial interests of the teams at meetings with the fédération internationale du sport automobile fisa motorsport 's world governing body
after leaving march at the end of <year> mosley officially became legal advisor to foca which was led by ecclestone
in his biography of ecclestone terry lovell suggests that he appointed mosley to this role not only because of his legal ability but also because he saw in mosley the necessary diplomatic and political skills that made him perfectly suited to the establishment of the fia
the fédération internationale de l 'automobile fia was fisa 's parent body representing car users worldwide
in the same year mosley was nominated for a role at the fia bureau internationale de constructeurs d 'automobile
his nomination was blocked by french italian and german manufacturers
in the early <num> mosley represented foca in the fisa @-@ foca war a conflict between foca representing the mainly uk @-@ based independent teams and fisa which was supported by the grandee constructors owned by road car manufacturers primarily alfa romeo ferrari and renault
in <year> foca announced its own world federation of motor sport and ran the non @-@ championship <year> south african grand prix
the staging of this event with worldwide television coverage helped persuade jean @-@ marie balestre the fisa president that fisa would have to negotiate a settlement with foca
as mosley has since commented we were absolutely skint
if balestre could have held the manufacturer 's support for a little bit longer the constructors would have been on their knees
the outcome would then have been very different
mosley helped draw up the concorde agreement a document which resolved the dispute by essentially giving fisa control of the rules and foca control of promotion and television rights
the most recent version of the concorde agreement expired on <num> december <year> and a new one was being discussed as of <year>
in <year> the year after the first concorde agreement was signed mosley left his role at foca and formula one to work for the conservative party
that same year he established simtek research a racing technical consultancy firm with nick wirth a former march employee
he sold his share of simtek in <year> when elected president of the fisa
according to lovell in <year> mosley suggested to balestre that he could deal with his problems with ecclestone by mak ing him a member of the establishment
later that year ecclestone was appointed vice @-@ president of the fia 's promotional affairs with authority over formula one and the other motor sports authorised by the fia
in <year> mosley challenged balestre for the presidency of fisa
mosley said that his decision to challenge the frenchman was prompted by balestre 's reported intervention on behalf of his countryman alain prost to ensure that race stewards disqualified brazilian driver ayrton senna from the <year> japanese grand prix
mosley campaigned on the basis that balestre who was also president of the fia and of the fédération française du sport automobile could not effectively manage all these roles together
he also said that no @-@ one challenged balestre because they were afraid of the consequences and suggested that the fisa president should not interfere with f1 which could be left to run itself
mosley won the fisa presidency by <num> votes to <num> balestre remained as fia president
mosley resigned a year later fulfilling a promise made during his election campaign to seek a re @-@ affirmation of his mandate
i wanted to show people that i do what i say he said
now they can judge me in a year 's time
fisa immediately re @-@ elected him
as well as motorsport the fia 's remit includes the interests of motorists worldwide an area in which mosley wanted to involve himself that is what really interested me in f1 you maybe save one life every five years whereas in road safety you are talking about thousands of lives
a challenge to mosley 's election by jeffrey rose chairman of the british royal automobile club was withdrawn when it became clear that the majority of voters were already committed to mosley
the fisa was then merged into the fia as its sporting arm
after the deaths of drivers ayrton senna and roland ratzenberger at the <year> san marino grand prix worldwide media attention focused on the charismatic triple @-@ world champion senna rather than ratzenberger a virtual unknown driving for the minor simtek team
mosley did not go to senna 's funeral but attended that of ratzenberger
in a press conference <num> years later mosley said i went to his funeral because everyone went to senna 's
i thought it was important that somebody went to his
in the aftermath of the deaths and a number of other serious accidents mosley announced the formation of the advisory expert group chaired by professor sid watkins to research and improve safety in motor racing
watkins who learned of his new role by hearing mosley announce it on the radio has called it a novel and revolutionary approach
the resulting changes have included reducing the capacity and power of engines the use of grooved tyres to reduce cornering speeds the introduction of the hans device to protect drivers necks in accidents circuit re @-@ design and greatly increased requirements for crash testing of chassis
mosley was criticised for some of the very rapid changes announced in the immediate aftermath of the deaths at the san marino race
in <year> a deal was signed between ecclestone and the fia that passed all of the commercial rights to formula one to him for <num> years on the condition that they would return to the fia at the end of that period
ecclestone had been building up formula one as a television package since the early <num> investing heavily in new digital television technology
for the duration of the deal the fia would receive an index @-@ linked annual fixed royalty estimated by lovell at around <num>
mosley said my belief is that i got a better deal than anyone else could have because it was more difficult for ecclestone to take a hard line with me as we had worked together for so long
the following year the fia also passed the rights to all its other directly sanctioned championships and events to ecclestone also for <num> years an attempt to add a <num> @-@ year extension to the f1 contract in return for a share in ecclestone 's proposed flotation of formula one was later vetoed by the european commission
mosley 's agreement with ecclestone on tv rights for f1 angered three of the team principals in particular ron dennis mclaren frank williams williams and ken tyrrell tyrrell who felt that neither ecclestone nor the fia had the right to make such an agreement without the teams
they refused to sign the <year> concorde agreement without increased financial returns and threatened to make a complaint under european union competition rules
the european commission was already investigating the fia ’ s agreement with ecclestone in what lovell calls a highly personal and bitter battle between max mosley and eu commissioner karel van miert
later that year the eu commission directorate @-@ general for competition made a preliminary decision against ecclestone and the fia
the resulting warning letters from van miert to the fia and ecclestone were leaked and ended the attempt to float f1 the fia won a case against the commission for the leakage in <year>
at the same time a local court in germany ruled that the television rights to the fia european truck racing cup passed to ecclestone by the fia the previous year along with all other fia authorised championships should be returned to the series organiser following a complaint from german television company ae tv @-@ cooperations
the tv company argued that ecclestone and mosley were in breach of commercial clauses in the treaty of rome following the court 's decision mosley appealed the judgement and cancelled the series until further notice
on appeal the court ruled that the series organiser should be able to sell the television rights to whoever they felt was the best option for coverage and the fia reinstated the european truck racing cup
between <year> and <year> mosley repeatedly warned that if any eu decision went against the fia the marketing organisations and f1 itself would be moved out of europe
in <year> the eu commission directorate @-@ general for competition issued a statement of objections listing a number of grievances surrounding the fia 's dealings with ecclestone and formula one
the fia released the statement to the media and held a press conference in brussels ridiculing the commission ’ s case
the commission argued that a number of commercial agreements could be viewed as anti @-@ competition and invited the fia and ecclestone 's companies isc and foa to submit proposals to modify these arrangements
in <year> nine months after settlement talks had begun the parties reached an agreement to amend existing contracts which included ecclestone stepping down as the fia 's vice @-@ president of promotional affairs and the fia ending all involvement in the commercial activities of formula one
mosley came up with an innovative way to dispose of the fia 's involvement in the commercial activities of formula one
in order to maintain ecclestone 's investment to deliver digital television he proposed extending ecclestone 's rights for f1 coverage to <num> years from the initial <num> arguing that a deal of such length could not be anti @-@ competition as it was effectively the same as an outright sale
the commission agreed with his assessment and in the interest of impartiality mosley removed himself from the negotiations which eventually returned around <num> million £ <num> million
the fia planned to put almost all of it into a charitable foundation which will then have the resources to undertake important work on improving safety in motor sport and in road safety and thus the fia foundation was created in <year>
in addition the fia continued to receive an annual dividend from the deal mosley stated over the totality of the contract and on an annual basis the sum we have accepted represents billions of dollars
looked at from that point of view it is a huge amount of money
lovell compares the figure to extend the rights to <num> years to the £ <num> million kirchgruppe paid for the rights to the <year> football world cup and the £ <num>
<num> billion british sky broadcasting paid for a three @-@ year package of english premier league football
the figure was not entirely comparable however due to the dispute over who actually owned formula one
before the settlement with the eu commission was reached mosley feared that the fia was losing control over the sport following a heated argument with ecclestone in paris
ecclestone argued that he had built formula one into the entity that it was and the fia only had rights to designate the event as official
ecclestone threatened to do a scorched earth if another party were to gain control of the commercial side of formula one
mosley came up with the solution in order for the fia to retain its sporting management role and ecclestone to retain his commercial role
over the same period mosley was attempting to delay european legislation banning tobacco advertising
at this time all leading formula one teams carried significant branding from tobacco brands such as rothmans west marlboro and mild seven
the labour party had pledged to ban tobacco advertising in its manifesto ahead of its <year> general election victory supporting a proposed european union directive
the labour party 's stance on banning tobacco advertising was reinforced following the election by forceful statements from the health secretary frank dobson and minister for public health tessa jowell
ecclestone appealed over jowell 's head to jonathan powell tony blair 's chief of staff who arranged a meeting with blair
ecclestone and mosley both labour party donors met blair on <num> october <year>
mosley argued that the proposed legislation was illegal by eu rules that formula one needed more time to find alternative sources of funding and that the prompt introduction of a ban would lead to races being held outside europe while the coverage including tobacco logos would still be broadcast into the eu
he also argued that motor racing was a world class industry which put britain at the hi @-@ tech edge
deprived of tobacco money formula one would move abroad at the loss of <num> @,@ <num> jobs <num> @,@ <num> part @-@ time jobs and £ <num> million of exports
on <num> november the fiercely anti @-@ tobacco jowell argued in brussels for an exemption for formula one
media attention initially focused on labour bending its principles for a glamour sport and on the false trail of jowell 's husband 's links to the benetton formula one team
on <num> november correspondents from three newspapers enquired whether labour had received any donations from ecclestone he had donated £ <num> million in january <year>
on <num> november labour promised to return the money on the advice of sir patrick neill
on <num> november blair apologised for his government 's mishandling of the affair and stated the decision to exempt formula one from tobacco sponsorship was taken two weeks later
it was in response to fears that britain might lose the industry overseas to asian countries who were bidding for it
the revised directive went into force in june <year> and banned sponsorship from <year> with a further three @-@ year extension for global sports such as formula one
on <num> october <year> the directive was successfully overturned in the european court of justice on the grounds that it was unlawful
a new tobacco advertising directive took effect in july <year> the financial times described mosley as furious that this was a year earlier than provided for under the <year> directive
as of <year> ferrari is the only f1 team to retain tobacco sponsorship although the team carries no explicit branding in races because of the european legislation
although the fia moved its headquarters out of the eu in <year> it returned in <year> all of the f1 teams remain in europe and six are in the uk compared to seven of eleven at the end of <year>
asked in a <year> interview about his most enduring achievement as president of the fia mosley replied i think using formula one to push encap crash @-@ testing
the european new car assessment programme euro ncap is a european car safety performance assessment programme that originated with work done by the transport research laboratory for the uk department for transport
the fia became involved in the programme in <year> taking a lead in promoting it and mosley chaired the body from its launch as euro ncap in <year> to <year>
despite what ncap describes as a strong negative response from car manufacturers at first the initiative has expanded and ncap says that there has been a clear increase in the safety of modern cars as a result
the eu commission in <year> stated that euroncap had become the single most important mechanism for achieving advances in vehicle safety and the most cost effective road safety action available to the eu
mosley has continued to promote the matter through his membership of initiatives such as cars <num> the european commission ’ s policy group aimed at improving the worldwide competitiveness of the european automotive industry
in february <year> mosley announced his intention to stand again for the presidency in october of that year saying that if successful this third term would be his last
from <year> formula one saw the return of teams partly or wholly owned and operated by major motor manufacturers who feared that under ecclestone 's management f1 coverage would go to pay television reducing the value of their investment
in <year> the grand prix manufacturers association gpma announced an alternative world championship the grand prix world championship to start by <year>
the gpma stipulated that the championship should not be regulated by the fia which lovell believes was because the organisation believed mosley was too close to ecclestone
in june <year> mosley announced that he would step down from his position in october of that year one year early saying i no longer find it either satisfying or interesting to sit in long meetings
i have achieved in this job everything i set out to

one month later he rescinded his decision after the fia senate called for him to stay on
according to a bbc sport profile many insiders considered that the announcement and mosley 's public disagreements with ecclestone were just part of a well crafted plan to strengthen their control over the sport ron dennis the mclaren team principal suggested that it arose because mosley 's proposals for formula one met opposition
in <year> mosley said he felt ferrari 's then team principal jean todt should succeed him as president of the fia when he stepped down
the <year> united states grand prix was run with only six cars after the michelin tyres used by the other <num> cars proved unsafe for the circuit
a proposal involving the addition of a temporary chicane to slow cars through the fastest corner of the circuit was suggested but rejected by mosley
he stated his reasons for not agreeing to the chicane formula one is a dangerous activity and it would be most unwise to make fundamental changes to a circuit without following tried and tested procedures
what happened was bad but can be put right
this is not true of a fatality
he continued formula one is a sport which entertains
it is not entertainment disguised as sport
mosley gave three possible solutions for the michelin runners to use qualifying tyres but change them whenever necessary on safety grounds to use a different tyre to be provided by michelin or to run at reduced speed
these were all rejected by the michelin @-@ shod teams
paul stoddart the then @-@ owner of the minardi team who ran on bridgestone tyres was prepared to compromise to accommodate michelin teams — even though a reduced field would guarantee his team much needed points — and was particularly vocal in his criticism and renewed his calls for mosley to resign
in recognition of his contribution to road safety and motorsport mosley was made a chevalier dans l ’ ordre de la légion d ’ honneur in <year>
the légion d 'honneur legion of honour is france 's highest decoration for outstanding achievements in military or civil life a chevalier knight is the fifth class
continuing a theme of his presidency in <year> mosley called for formula one manufacturers to develop technology relevant to road cars
in recent years a large proportion of the enormous budget of formula one has been spent on the development of very powerful very high @-@ revving engines which some say have little applicability to road cars
mosley has announced a <num> @-@ year freeze on the development of engines which would allow manufacturers to spend more of their budgets on environmentally friendly technology such as the kinetic energy recovery system kers introduced in <year>
in july <year> he sent a letter to the formula one teams in which he called for the teams to propose future sporting regulations to address specific issues including reduced fuel consumption
the <year> formula one season was dominated by ferrari 's accusations that the mclaren team had made illegal use of their intellectual property leading to legal cases in the united kingdom and italy
unlike previous cases such as the toyota team 's illegal use of ferrari intellectual property in <year> that had been handled by german police the fia investigated
they initially found mclaren innocent unable to find enough evidence to suggest that anyone other than designer mike coughlan had seen the information or that the team had used it
ron dennis team principal of mclaren was unaware at this point that mosley had been sent personal e @-@ mails from fernando alonso stating that the data had been used and seen by others in the team
when italian police uncovered a series of text messages between mclaren and their spy at ferrari the team was hauled in front of the world motor sports council wmsc once more
this time they were found guilty and eventually fined a gross <num> and excluded from the <year> constructors championship
later in the year the renault team was found guilty by the fia of possessing mclaren 's intellectual property but was not punished as the fia 's wmsc decided there was not enough evidence to show the championship had been affected
in relation to mclaren triple world champion jackie stewart criticised mosley and stated that other teams did not back mclaren for fear of repercussions
tv commentator and newspaper columnist martin brundle a former driver was among those who criticised the fia and mosley for inconsistency and questioned the energetic manner in which he felt mclaren was being pursued suggesting that there was a witch hunt against the team
brundle and the sunday times subsequently received a writ for libel before the paper printed a correction
mosley went on to defend himself of the charges made by brundle highlighting that the wmsc originally acquitted mclaren of any wrongdoing stating concrete evidence of use by mclaren of the ferrari information was simply not there
it was only later in the year when e @-@ mails emerged which showed others inside mclaren were indeed aware of the ferrari information that the fia found the team guilty
at the start of <year> mosley said that he wanted to see through reforms such as budget capping and new technologies like kers successfully introduced into formula one before retiring
in march of that year the news of the world released video footage of mosley engaged in acts with five consenting women in a scenario that the paper alleged involved nazi role @-@ playing an allegation that though dismissed in court as no genuine basis allegedly ruined mosley 's reputation
the situation was made more controversial by his father 's association with the nazis
mosley admitted the embarrassment the revelations caused but said that there was no nazi theme involved
he was strongly criticised by former drivers motor manufacturers and several of the national motoring bodies who form the fia
his involvement in several high level motor sport events was cancelled
public expressions of support were limited
mosley says that he received much supportive correspondence and said that he would continue to the end of his current term which he said would be his last
mosley 's longtime ally ecclestone eventually appeared to support mosley 's removal
mosley won a vote of confidence at an extraordinary general meeting of the fia on <num> june <year> with <num> votes in support and <num> against with seven abstentions and four invalid votes
several clubs including the adac aaa and knaf considered withdrawal from the fia after the decision
other formerly critical organisations have since said that they will accept the outcome of the vote and now wish to move on
in july <year> mosley won a high court legal case against the news of the world for invasion of privacy
the presiding judge mr justice eady said i see no genuine basis at all for the suggestion that the participants mocked the victims of the holocaust
in december <year> mosley said that he still intended to stand down when his term ran out in october <year> but would take the final decision in june of that year
mosley 's close relationship with ecclestone the sport 's promoter was criticised in early <year> by sir jackie stewart who suggested that mosley should resign in favour of a ceo from outside motorsport
in mid @-@ <year> the fia and the newly formed formula one teams association disagreed over the format of rules for the following season
when the entry list for the <year> championship was announced on <num> june <year> the entries of five of the eight fota teams remained provisional on their acceptance of the new rules
the next day the european automobile manufacturers association announced its support for fota 's request for stability clear rules a clear and transparent system of governance and their threat to form a breakaway series from formula one
the bbc sport website reported this as an attack on mosley 's authority and noted that mosley was expected to stand again for the presidency in <year>
on <num> june mosley said he was considering running for a fifth term as fia president in october in light of the attack on my mandate
however the following day fota and the fia reached an agreement with mosley agreeing not to stand for re @-@ election as part of the deal now there is peace
luca di montezemolo welcomed mosley 's decision to stand down and called mosley a dictator
mosley responded by saying that he was still considering his options and might well stand for re @-@ election in october after all
he later said that he was under pressure from all over the world to stand for re @-@ election
on <num> july mosley confirmed that he would after all stand down and again endorsed former ferrari executive director jean todt as his successor
todt went on to win the presidency

<year> called to the bar gray ’ s inn
justice eady ruled that despite some of the attendees wearing german world war <num> uniforms there were no nazi connotations to the orgy a false statement that had been printed by the newspaper
as a result in <year> mosley brought a case mosley v united kingdom against the uk 's privacy laws in the european court of human rights in a bid to force newspapers to warn people before exposing their private lives so they could have the opportunity to seek a court injunction
the case was rejected by the court on <num> may <year> as they argued that a pre @-@ notification requirement would inevitably affect political reporting and serious journalism
in july <year> the daily telegraph reported that mosley was financially guaranteeing the court costs of claimants who may have been subjected to phone hacking by the news of the world
mosley refused to comment at the time but he later gave a tv interview to the bbc and telephone interview to reuters where he confirmed the story
mosley launched legal action against google in an attempt to stop searches from returning web pages which use the photographs from the video used for the news of the world story
on <num> november <year> in mosley v sarl google a french court sided with mosley and ordered google to prevent its search engine from providing links to images of mosley engaging in sexual activities from the video
the register suggested the ruling would lead to a streisand effect increasing interest in the images which are still findable through other search engines
at the leveson enquiry mosley stated his reasons for pursuing google the fundamental point is that google could stop this material appearing but they don 't or they won 't as a matter of principle
my position is that if the search engines if somebody were to stop the search engines producing the material the actual sites don 't really matter because without a search engine nobody will find it it would just be a few friends of the person who posts it
the really dangerous things are the search engines
mosley launched similar legal action against google in germany
in january <year> the german court also ruled against the american company
in giving its verdict the court stated that the banned pictures of the plaintiff severely violate his private sphere
in an interview with der spiegel following the judgement mosley said strictly speaking google has got to obey german courts in germany and french courts in france
but in the end it has to decide whether it wants to live in a democracy
google behaves like an adolescent rebelling against the establishment
the company has to recognise that it is a part of society and it must accept the responsibility which comes with that
it provides engineering support to the united states army pacific command
the brigade specializes in bridging operations
the brigade traces its lineage back to an engineering regiment active during world war ii but the brigade itself did not see action until the mid @-@ <num>
as a part of the v corps for most of the cold war the brigade was stationed in western europe for decades as a deterrent to a possible soviet invasion
it finally saw action during operation joint endeavor providing bridging assistance for the international force in the bosnia region
several years later the brigade was the primary engineering component during the invasion of iraq in <year>
with numerous difficulties the brigade was forced to take on several unexpected missions during its year in iraq
it saw a second tour in <year> and a third in <year> in which it once again was the primary engineering component in the country
the brigade deployed to afghanistan as the theater engineer brigade in support of operation enduring freedom from <year> @-@ <year>
the brigade had a long history of supporting v corps of united states army europe from <year> until <year> during which it was based at warner barracks in the bavarian town of bamberg germany
that ended when the brigade was relocated to hawaii to support united states army pacific as part of a major restructuring plan of the us army
reactivated in <year> the brigade is currently at home in hawaii
it provides engineering assistance to us forces stationed throughout the pacific ocean region
the brigade 's headquarters and headquarters company is stationed at schofield barracks and permanently commands two subordinate battalions
the <num> engineer battalion and the <num> engineer battalion are both located at schofield barracks
the total force of the brigade and its subordinate elements is approximately <num> @,@ <num>
as the brigade is modular in nature it is able to take command and control of more units when deployed
the regiment was activated on <num> july <year> at camp ellis illinois
it was deployed to the european theatre where it participated in the battle of normandy and subsequent invasion of germany before being transferred to the pacific after v @-@ e day
the <num> received campaign streamers for normandy northern france rhineland ardennes @-@ alsace central europe and the asian @-@ pacific theatre
it was deactivated in japan on <num> january <year>
the regiment was re @-@ designated as headquarters and headquarters company <num> engineer aviation brigade in japan on <num> july <year> before being activated in september of that year
only a few months later this brigade was inactivated on <num> june <year> without having seen any deployment
on <num> june <year> headquarters and headquarters company <num> engineer aviation brigade was re @-@ designated as headquarters and headquarters company <num> engineer brigade and activated in pioneer kaserne hanau germany
the <num> engineer brigade was a consolidation of v corps <num> and <num> engineer groups into a single unit that would provide more efficient command and control
it was subsequently put under the command of v corps as part of the us army 's force in europe
the brigade received its shoulder sleeve insignia on <num> september <year> and its distinctive unit insignia on <num> november <year>
brigade members specially designed these with images alluding to the <num> regiment 's battle honors in world war ii using scarlet and white colors signifying us army engineer units
the brigade remained in germany in support of v corps for almost <num> years seeing no deployments
it underwent a shuffling of units as several of its battalions were reassigned elsewhere following the end of the cold war in <year> and it gained new battalions from units deactivating elsewhere
though three of the brigade 's subordinate battalions deployed to support operation desert shield and operation desert storm the brigade headquarters itself remained in germany along with the rest of v corps
the operations were conducted by vii corps and xviii airborne corps which had significant engineer assets of their own
throughout the early <num> the brigade would continue to see units come and go from its command as they were transferred from the restructuring <num> engineer brigade and the deactivating <num> engineer brigade
the <num> engineer company deployed their topographic surveying platoon the following year
the <num> engineer brigade was tasked with building an assault bridge over the sava river
despite severe flooding conditions around the river and international pressure against such a structure the brigade sent its units to begin work on the bridge
in december <year> the <num> engineer company deployed to zupanja croatia and placed the historic ribbon bridge over the river
this bridge at <num> @,@ <num> feet <num> m was the longest assault floating bridge in military history
the company operated <num> @-@ hours a day for three months crossing critical traffic in support of task force eagle and nato 's implementation force
the company also assisted in the construction of a second bridge over the sava river in brčko @-@ gunja
the <num> engineer company redeployed in may <year> with a rafting section remaining at slavonski brod to support the force restructuring of task force eagle
the <num> engineer brigade would go on to construct seven fixed bridges in support of the operation
during the deployment the brigade was also tasked with creating and maintaining maps and overlays of the area of operations
it would produce over <num> @,@ <num> such maps
the <num> engineer brigade was also tasked with repairing and maintaining much of the task force 's infrastructure
the brigade returned to germany after the operation was complete
throughout <year> – <year> it would train with german engineers including german units from lahnstein and speyer as well as the german engineering school
the brigade also set up marksman competitions with german units to give us soldiers the chance to earn the german armed forces badge of marksmanship the german sports badge and other badges
over <num> @,@ <num> of these badges would be earned by soldiers of the <num> over the years that it served in germany
it also trained extensively in bridging operations at rivers throughout germany
in summer of <year> the brigade participated in a joint engineering exercise in moldova with us navy seabees and the <num> engineer brigade of the north carolina army national guard
the exercise was the first ever conducted in moldova and featured numerous training scenarios as well as the construction of a medical clinic
several other such exercises were conducted in nations throughout europe including albania romania georgia latvia bulgaria and macedonia
they also performed annual humanitarian missions to poland working on community projects around the country with the assistance of polish armed forces every september as a training exercise
it was commanded by colonel gregg f
martin
as preparations were being made for operation iraqi freedom the <num> engineer brigade was placed in charge of the largest engineering force in the theater
this included seven different engineering battalions as well as several separate group and company sized elements
units of the brigade were then deployed to kuwait in early <year> along with much of v corps staff
they would provide command and assistance for the <num> infantry division <num> airborne division and 101st airborne division as they crossed the border to iraq and attacked to the capitol region of baghdad from the south
coupled with the landings of the <num> airborne brigade combat team to the north the operation would see the us forces surround and destroy iraqi forces in and around the capitol
the first obstacle facing the brigade was the berm a <num> @-@ kilometer @-@ deep defensive obstacle complex that spanned iraq 's border with kuwait
the berm consisted of large tank ditches berms of dirt electrified fencing and razor wire
it was decided that the <num> infantry division 's brigade combat teams would breach this berm in eight locations and move through
the <num> engineer brigade analyzed the berms and provided a layout of them to coalition forces
the <num> engineer brigade then conducted the actual breaches in late march using armored combat earthmovers to build roads for tracked vehicles while armored vehicle @-@ launched bridges set up for wheeled vehicles
the <num> worked with kuwati engineers to breach the berm in <num> places and the <num> infantry division 's brigade combat teams moved though starting the iraq war
after combat forces moved through the brigade and the kuwatis then sealed off ten of these breaches to prevent iraqi forces from using then leaving two open for us forces that followed from the <num> and 101st
after the breach the <num> moved into iraq
they provided support for the divisions as they advanced along the path to baghdad
when a large sandstorm grounded aviation and large dust clouds became a problem the brigade repurposed oil for use in dust abatement around airfields allowing the 101st 's fleet of ah @-@ <num> apaches to take off and engage iraqi ground forces on <num> march
retreating iraqi units detonated many bridges to slow the <num> infantry division 's advance
the <num> engineers conducted rapid repairs to allow the brigades to continue to move through
the brigade supported combat elements moving through an najaf clearing roads and pathways of debris and obstacles to allow rapid movement through the city
the <num> engineer battalion built the birthday bridge – the longest float bridge constructed in a combat theatre with a span of <num> meters – over the tigris river in tikrit on saddam hussein ’ s birthday <num> april <year>
after the invasion was over the brigade was supposed to support the operation with bridging and infrastructure support
during the planning for the invasion the engineers of the brigade were told that reconstruction in iraq would be conducted by department of defense contractors and iraqi civilians
they were not originally prepared to conduct major reconstruction efforts
when v corps became the commanding element for the task force to rebuild iraq much of the invasion force including the <num> engineer brigade was sent to do jobs they had not been originally planned for as basic utilities and sanitation conditions in iraq were far below what was expected
throughout the rest of <year> and <year> the engineers engaged in a large number of initial reconstruction projects on basic utilities including schools water treatment plants waste removal and the nation 's power grid
it was determined that the scale of these projects was much greater than what the us had expected or what had been encountered in previous contingencies
it was also decided that reconstruction was essential to the coalition since it would help win over the iraqi people
by may <year> the brigade had been completely repurposed
though originally tasked with demolishing obstacles building fortifications and bridging operations the brigade was tasked entirely with construction projects
this conversion was a difficult process as the brigade did not have the equipment and specialist units designed to handle reconstruction on a national scale
as more us military reconstruction units arrived in iraq the brigade grew to eight battalions and three groups
the <num> engineer brigade focused on bridging projects as was its specialty but it ultimately found itself undertaking numerous different projects throughout the country for much of <year> and into <year>
not all of its units were confined entirely to construction though
the <num> engineer company also conducted river patrol operations in baghdad and tikrit
this new mission for the company was essential for force protection troop transportation search and cordon operations and to protect against sabotage on fixed bridges
in september <year> with the inactivation of the <num> engineer company medium girder bridge the <num> engineer company became a multi @-@ role bridge company with both float and fixed bridging capabilities and the only active bridge company in usareur
the <num> was headquartered at logistical support area anaconda for the majority of the deployment
throughout operation iraqi freedom the headquarters commanded up to <num> @,@ <num> engineers at one time conducting missions including bridging humanitarian assistance topographic missions dive missions firefighting base construction river patrols mine detection missile removal and many more
brigade units redeployed to hanau in late <year> and early <year>
most of the brigade 's soldiers returned to hanau on <num> february <year> after numerous logistical delays
most of the <num> engineer brigade 's subordinate units would receive meritorious unit commendation for their roles in the invasion of iraq though the brigade 's headquarters did not
the company returned to hanau in september <year>
in december <year> the <num> engineer brigade 's headquarters was informed that it would be deployed back to iraq the next year
the brigade mobilized and began this new deployment in september <year> it began operating in the country the next month
the <num> engineer battalion followed in october
the brigade eventually replaced the <num> <num> and <num> engineer brigades becoming the only engineer brigade operating in the country
by december <year> the brigade commanded all engineering formations in multi @-@ national corps iraq including engineers from other branches of the us military for a total of <num> @,@ <num> soldiers
during the tour they were supported by the <num> engineer command
the <num> engineers had a variety of reconstruction tasks during their second tour in iraq
the top priority of the brigade was to maintain and upgrade lines of communications to insure uninterrupted ground movement through the area of operations
this duty also included detection and removal of improvised explosive devices
the brigade undertook numerous construction projects primarily in building coalition forward operating bases but they were tasked with construction projects for the iraqi army and civilians as well
many of the units of the brigade were integrated with military from other branches for projects
us navy and us marine corps engineers operated side @-@ by @-@ side with <num> engineer brigade soldiers and though commanders reported a culture clash between different branches of service the soldiers sailors and marines were able to adapt to the situation quickly
the brigade 's headquarters company managed the engineer battalions but it also undertook its own missions including humanitarian missions and public affairs assignments
it was supported by the brigade 's special troops battalion which provided a wide range of duties for the headquarters
the task of detecting and removing ieds proved particularly difficult for the brigade as ieds were a serious issue for coalition forces and the leading cause of casualties at the time
the <num> engineer battalion under the <num> was specially tasked with counter @-@ ied operations on the over <num> kilometers of roads that the brigade was responsible for
the <num> engineer battalion was charged with maintaining the power grid throughout iraq
they were required to assess <num> power stations throughout the country and make repairs to each one individually
the <num> engineer battalion was tasked with most construction projects in the forward operating bases
these projects involved expansion of many of the larger fobs as smaller ones were shut down and consolidated
one of the main focuses of the battalion was the expansion of living quarters at al asad air base
the <num> engineer battalion was responsible for maintaining the supply yards housing building materials for the rest of the brigade 's battalions and to ensure that the materials were dispersed and used as efficiently as possible
the brigade 's mechanical and vehicle maintenance duties were provided by civilian contractors
these contractors also handled transportation of construction vehicles and vehicle parts to the theater
during the year of its deployment in iraq the brigade reported progress in numerous areas
brigade commander colonel thomas kula reported that greater than <num> percent of ieds found on roads used by the corps were recognized and disarmed before they could be used against coalition forces
the brigade also cleared <num> kilometers of road from trash and debris and filled more than <num> potholes caused by explosions
it also completed <num> @,@ <num> mapping projects in the theater
the brigade also finished numerous building projects around iraq
soldiers of the <num> engineer brigade completed <num> construction projects during the year in the country including emplacing four bridges and maintaining eight more well digging projects throughout western iraq maintaining the power grid to <num> coalition bases repairing and expanding services at fobs throughout the region and construction of outposts and checkpoints throughout the country 's roadways with the assistance of iraqi engineers
during the deployment a total of <num> soldiers from the brigade were killed in action
the <num> engineer brigade returned to hanau from its second tour in iraq in october <year>
the brigade formally left hanau with a casing of the unit colors ceremony at pioneer kaserne on <num> may <year>
casing the unit 's colors was a tradition formally signifying its inactivation and for all official purposes the brigade had ceased to be an active army unit
the brigade headquarters became part of u
s
army pacific on <num> june <year>
the brigade had originally been slated to relocate to fort lewis washington to replace the <num> engineer brigade which was scheduled to be inactivated
but with the announcement of the grow the army plan in early <year> it was decided that no engineer brigades would be inactivated permanently and the <num> engineer brigade would be moved to hawaii instead
both the <num> and <num> engineer brigades remained on active duty
the brigade was inactive for a year while it was reconstructed in hawaii
as a part of the transformation of the us army the brigade was reorganized into a modular force with new and updated equipment and new personnel
the brigade stood up provisionally on <num> june <year> as it neared ready status
on <num> october the brigade 's colors were formally uncased at schofield barracks hawaii
this signified the end of the brigade 's relocation to hawaii as well as its completion and readiness to take on new missions
the brigade took command of the <num> <num> and <num> engineer battalions
there its missions will once again include construction route clearance and training of iraqi engineers
since being alerted for deployment the brigade began conducting vigorous mission rehearsal exercise mre training at schofield barracks
among this training has been updated strategies for detection and clearance of improvised explosive devices
the brigade began its deployment on <num> july <year> uncasing its colors in mosul and taking command of construction projects in the area from the <num> engineer brigade
the <num> engineer brigade returned to schofield barracks hawaii from iraq on <num> june <year>
in this capacity the brigade provided combat engineering construction engineering and dive operations support to joint and combined partners at more than <num> theater security cooperation program tscp exercises and multiple company sized deployments to operations new dawn and enduring freedom
the <num> engineer brigade served as the combined joint civil military operations task force cjmotf for balikatan <year> in the philippines
for over two months the brigade headquarters along with platoons from the <num> engineer battalion built schools and all @-@ purpose facilities
meanwhile the brigade 's subordinate joint partners conducted veterinarian and medical events to help improve the lives of the filipino people
this event sharpened the brigade 's skills at responding to humanitarian aid and disaster response hadr events throughout the region
upon completion of bk11 the brigade shifted its training focus from stability operations to major combat operations
specifically the brigade initiated a <num> @-@ month train @-@ up plan for its mctp graded war @-@ fighter with the <num> infantry division in korea
through a series of individual and collective training events the brigade honed sharpened and in some cases re @-@ learned the skills necessary to achieve victory in a high @-@ intensity conflict
through ufg12 2id 's war @-@ path ii exercise and finally the full spectrum exercise in november <year> the <num> engineer brigade earned some of the highest marks and accolades ever given to a brigade by the mctp during a certification war @-@ fighter exercise
through these series of exercises the <num> engineer brigade helped usfk <num> army and 2id refine and improve their most significant oplans by updating tpfdds task organizations engineer concepts of operations and combined arms gap @-@ crossing plans
the <num> engineer brigade along with <num> army and 2id remain ready to fight tonight if called upon
this marked the brigade headquarters first deployment to afghanistan
after a two @-@ week handover period the <num> engineer brigade officially took over on <num> october <year> from the <num> engineer brigade from joint base lewis @-@ mcchord wa joint task force triple nickel thus becoming joint task force sapper overseeing u

<num> million years ago
it lived in what is now north america
its name means helmet lizard derived from greek κόρυς
it was named and described in <year> by barnum brown
corythosaurus is now thought to be a lambeosaurine related to nipponosaurus velafrons hypacrosaurus and olorotitan
corythosaurus has an estimated length of <num> metres <num> ft and has a skull including the crest that is <num>
<num> centimetres <num>
<num> in tall
corythosaurus is known from many complete specimens including the nearly complete holotype found by brown in <year>
the holotype skeleton is only missing the last section of the tail and part of the forelimbs but was preserved with impressions of polygonal scales
corythosaurus is known from many skulls with tall crests
the crests resemble the crests of the cassowary and a corinthian helmet
the most likely function of the crest is thought to be vocalization
as in a trombone sound waves would travel through many chambers in the crest and then get amplified when corythosaurus exhaled
a corythosaurus specimen has been preserved with its last meal in its chest cavity
inside the cavity were remains of conifer needles seeds twigs and fruits corythosaurus probably fed on all of these
the two species of corythosaurus are both present in slightly different levels of the dinosaur park formation
both still co @-@ existed with theropods and other ornithischians like daspletosaurus brachylophosaurus parasaurolophus scolosaurus and chasmosaurus
as well as an almost complete skeleton the find was notable because impressions of much of the creature 's skin had also survived
the specimen came from the belly river group of the province
the left or underside of the skeleton was preserved in carbonaceous clay making it difficult to expose the skin
the skeleton was articulated and only missing about the last <num>
<num> metres <num>
<num> ft of the tail and the forelimbs
both scapulae and coracoids are preserved in position but the rest of the forelimbs are gone except for phalanges and pieces of humeri ulnae and radii
apparently the remaining forelimbs were weathered or eroded away
impressions of the integument were preserved covering over a large part of the skeletons outlining and shows the form of the body
another specimen amnh <num> was found in <year> by brown and peter kaisen
both specimens are now housed in the american museum of natural history in their original death poses
the type species corythosaurus casuarius was named by barnum brown in <year> based on the first specimen collected by him in <year>
amnh <num> is thus the holotype
in <year> the original author brown published a more detailed description which was also based on amnh <num> which specimen is therefore the plesiotype
corythosaurus is among many lambeosaurines that possess crests and it was the crest that lends corythosaurus its name
the generic name corythosaurus is derived from greek κόρυθος korythos corinthian helmet and means helmeted lizard
the specific name casuarius refers to the cassowary a bird with a similar skull crest
the full binomial of corythosaurus casuarius thus means cassowary @-@ like reptile with a corinthian helmet crest
the two best preserved specimens of corythosaurus found by charles h
sternberg in <year> were lost on <num> december <year> while being carried to the united kingdom during world war one
they were being sent to arthur smith woodward a paleontologist of the british museum of natural history in england when the ship transporting them was sunk by the german merchant raider sms möwe in the middle of the ocean
there were formerly up to seven species described including c
casuarius c
bicristatus parks <year> c
brevicristatus parks <year> c
excavatus gilmore <year> c
frontalis parks <year> and c
intermedius parks <year>
in <year> peter dodson studied the differences between the skulls and crests of different species of lambeosaurine dinosaurs
he found that the differences in size and shape may have actually been related to the gender and age of the animal
now only one species is recognized for certain c
casuarius although c
intermedius has been recognized as valid in some studies
it is based on specimen rom <num> a skull found by levi sternberg in <year> and was named by william parks in <year> who had originally named it stephanosaurus intermedius earlier that year
the specific name of c
intermedius is derived from its apparent intermediate position according to parks
c
intermedius lived at a slightly later time in the campanian than c
casuarius and the two species are not identical which supported the separation of them in a <year> study
<year> estimated that corythosaurus has an average length of <num> metres <num> ft
richard swann lull 's earlier length estimate published in <year> found a slightly longer total length of <num>
<num> m <num> ft a size similar to lambeosaurus lambei another canadian lambeosaurine
in <year> edwin h
colbert used models of specific dinosaurs including corythosaurus to estimate their weight
the corythosaurus model used was modelled by vincent fusco after a mounted skeleton and supervised by barnum brown
after testing it was concluded that the average weight of corythosaurus was <num>
<num> tonnes <num>
<num> long tons <num>
<num> short tons
more recent size estimates of corythosaurus published in <year> find the genus to be among the largest hadrosaurids only smaller than shantungosaurus and parasaurolophus
the total length of corythosaurus specimen amnh <num> was found to be <num>
<num> m <num> ft with a weight of <num>
<num> tonnes <num>
<num> long tons <num>
<num> short tons
proportionally the skull is much shorter and smaller than that of edmontosaurus formerly trachodon kritosaurus or saurolophus but when including its crest its superficial area is almost as large
as with other lambeosaurines the animal bore a tall elaborate bony crest atop its skull which contained the elongate narial passages
the narial passages extended into the crest first into separate pockets in the sides then into a single central chamber and onward into the respiratory system
the skull of the type specimen has no dermal impressions on it
during preservation it was compressed laterally so now the width is about two @-@ thirds what it would have been in real life
according to brown the compression also caused the nasals to shift where they pressed down on the premaxillaries
because they were pressed on the premaxillaries the nasals would have closed the nares
apart from the compression the skull appears to be normal
contrary to what brown assumed the areas concerned were fully part of the praemaxillae
the crests of corythosaurus resemble that of a cassowary or a corinthian helmet
they are formed by a combination of the praemaxillae nasals prefrontals and frontals as in saurolophus but instead of projecting backwards as a spine they rise up to make the highest point above the orbit
the two halves of the crest are separated by a median suture
in front of the orbit the crest is made of thick bone
the nasals make up most of the crest
brown assumed that they extended from the beaks tip to the highest spot along the crest and that unlike those in other genera the nasals meet in the centre and are not separated in front by an ascending premaxillary process
brown however mistook the praemaxillae for the nasals the snout is actually largely formed by them and they do separate the nasals
brown also thought that on the top and back of the crest the whole external face is covered by the frontals
again he made a mistake what he assumed to be the frontals are in fact the nasals
the nasals end at the back of the squamosals in a hooked short process
the prefrontals also make up part of the crest however brown mistook the lower upper branch of the praemaxilla for the prefrontal
the actual prefrontal triangular in shape is located at the side of the crest base it was by brown seen as a part of the frontal
the real frontals largely internal to the crest base structure are not visible from the side
the mouth of the holotype of corythosaurus is narrow
the praemaxillae each form two long folds
the folds enclose air passages extending the narial passages to the front of the snout
there they end in narrow openings sometimes called pseudonares false bony nostrils
these were mistaken by brown for the real nares or nostrils
these are actually situated inside the crest above the eye sockets
as in saurolophus the expanded portion of the premaxillary in front of the pseudonaris opening is elongate by comparison in kritosaurus the bill is short and the pseudonares extend far forward
at the end of the corythosaurus bill the two pseudonares unite into one
because of his incorrect identification brown assumed that the holotype 's inferior process of the premaxillary was shorter than in kritosaurus and saurolophus and that the process does not unite with the lacrimal another difference from those genera
the praemaxilla actually does touch the lacrimal and extends to the rear until well behind the eye socket
the lower jaw of the holotype is <num>
<num> centimetres <num>
<num> in long and <num> centimetres <num>
<num> in deep

<num> in
casuarius the sides and tail of the body are covered in scales of several types
polygonal tuberculate scales covered in small bumps vary in size over the body
conical limpet @-@ like scales are only preserved on a fold of skin preserved on the back of the tibia but which was probably from the bottom of the belly rather than the leg
separating the polygonal scales of c
casuarius are shieldlike scales arranged close together in rows
ossified tendons are present on all the vertebrae except for those in the cervical region
on no vertebrae do the tendons extend below the transverse processes
each tendon is flattened at its origin and transversely ovoid in the central rod ending at a rounded point
aside from those found on corythosaurus casuarius extensive skin impressions have been found on edmontosaurus annectens and notable integument has also been found on brachylophosaurus canadensis gryposaurus notabilis parasaurolophus walkeri lambeosaurus magnicristatus l
lambei saurolophus angustirsotris and on unidentified ornithopods
of these l
lambei c
casuarius g
notabilis p
walkeri and s
angustirsotris have preserved polygonal scales
the scales on l
lambei s
angustirostris and c
casuarius are all similar
corythosaurus is one of very few hadrosaurids which have preserved skin impressions on the hind limbs and feet
a study in <year> showed that amongst hadrosaurids saurolophus angustirostris preserved the best and most complete foot and limb integument although other species like s
osborni edmontosaurus annectens and lambeosaurus lambei l
clavinitialis share a fair amount of preserved tissue on those regions
it was once thought that this dinosaur lived mostly in the water due to the appearance of webbed hands and feet
however it was later discovered that the so @-@ called webs were in fact deflated padding much like that found on many modern mammals
in <year> brown expanded the character set to include more features in the revised version a comparatively short skull with a high helmet @-@ like crest formed by nasals prefrontals and frontals the nasals not being separated in front by premaxillaries a narrow beak expanded section in front of the elongated nares a small narial opening a vertebral formula of <num> cervicals <num> dorsals <num> sacrals and <num> caudals possession of dorsal spines of a medium height high anterior caudal spines long chevrons long scapulae possessing a blade of medium width a radius considerably longer than humerus comparatively short metacarpals an anteriorly decurved ilium a long ischium with a foot @-@ like terminal expansion a pubis with an anterior blade that is short and broadly expanded at end a femur that is longer than the tibia the phalanges of pes are short that the integument over the sides and tail composed of polygonal tuberculate scales without pattern but graded in size in different parts of the body and a belly with longitudinal rows of large conical limpet @-@ like scales separated by uniformly large polygonal tubercles
again the presumed traits of the snout are incorrect because brown confused the praemaxillae with the nasal bones and the nasal bones with the frontals
most of the postcranial traits are today known to be shared with other lambeosaurines
inside trachodontidae were the subfamilies trachodontinae and saurolophinae
brown classified hadrosaurus trachodon claosaurus and kritosaurus in trachodontinae and corythosaurus stephanosaurus and saurolophus in saurolophinae
later brown revised the phylogeny of corythosaurus and found that it was closely related and possibly ancestral to hypacrosaurus
the only differences he found between them were the development of the vertebrae and the proportions of the limbs
during a study of dinosaurian ilia in the <num> alfred sherwood romer proposed that the two orders of dinosaurs might have evolved separately and that birds based on the shape and proportions of their ilia might truly be specialized ornithischians
he used both tyrannosaurus and corythosaurus as a base model to analyze which theory is more likely true
he found that even though birds are thought of as saurischians it is very plausible for them to have evolved their specific pelvic musculature and anatomy if they evolved from ornithschians like corythosaurus
however even though corythosaurus does resemble modern birds in pelvic structure more than saurischians birds are now thought to have descended from the latter
corythosaurus is currently classified as a hadrosaurid in the subfamily lambeosaurinae
it is related to other hadrosaurs such as hypacrosaurus lambeosaurus and olorotitan with the exception of olorotitan they all share similar looking skulls and crests
however research published in <year> has suggested that even though it possesses a unique crest olorotitan is corythosaurus closest known relative
benson et al
<year> found that corythosaurus was closely related to velafrons nipponosaurus and hypacrosaurus and said that they formed a group of fan @-@ crested lambeosaurines
in <year> a study including the description of zhanghenglong was published in the journal plos one
the study included an almost complete cladogram of hadrosauroid relationships including corythosaurus as the most derived lambeosaurine as sister taxon to hypacrosaurus
the below cladogram is a simplified version including only lambeosaurini
the sense of hearing in hadrosaurids specifically such as lophorhothon also seems to have been greatly developed because of an elongated lagena
the presence of a thin stapes an ear bone that is rod @-@ like in reptiles combined with a large eardrum implies the existence of a sensitive middle ear
it is possible that hadrosaurid ears are sensitive enough to detect as much sound as a modern crocodilian
nasal passageways of corythosaurus as well as hypacrosaurus and lambeosaurus are s @-@ shaped with parasaurolophus only possessing u @-@ shaped tubes
any vocalization would travel through these elaborate chambers and probably get amplified
scientists speculate that corythosaurus could make loud low pitched cries like a wind or brass instrument such as a trombone
the sounds could serve to alert other corythosaurus to the presence of food or a potential threat from a predator
the nasal passages emit low @-@ frequency sounds when corythosaurus exhaled
the individual crests would produce different sounds so it is likely that each species of lambeosaurine would have had a unique sound
however even though the range for different lambeosaurine nasal passages vary they all probable made low @-@ pitched sounds
this might be because low sounds below <num> hz travel a set distance in any environment while higher above <num> hz sounds have a larger spread in the distance travelled
when they were first described crested hadrosaurs were thought to be aquatic an assessment based incorrectly on webbing that is now known to be padding
the theory was that the animals could swim deep in the water and use the crest to store air to breath
however it has now been proven that the crest did not have any holes in the end and the water pressure at even <num> metres <num>
<num> ft would be too great for the lungs to be able to inflate
altispinus to have had surviving fossilized juveniles assigned to it
juveniles are harder to assign to species because at a young age they lack the distinctive larger crests of adults
as they age lambeosaurine crests tend to grow and become more prominent come maturity
in the dinosaur park formation over fifty articulated specimens have been found coming from many different genera
among them juveniles are hard to identify at the species level
earlier four genera and thirteen species were recognized from the formation 's area when paleontologists used differences in size and crest shape to differentiate taxa
the smallest specimens were identified as tetragonosaurus now seen as a synonym of procheneosaurus and the largest skeletons were called either corythosaurus or lambeosaurus an adult was identified as parasaurolophus
small lambeosaurines from the horseshoe canyon formation were referred to cheneosaurus
corythosaurus started developing its crest when half the size of adults but parasaurolophus juveniles grew crests when only <num> as long as adults
juvenile corythosaurus along with adults had a premaxilla @-@ nasal fontanelle
young and adult corythosaurus are similar to lambeosaurus and hypacrosaurus but dissimilar to parasaurolophus in that the sutures of the skull are sinuous and not smooth and straight
this feature helps differentiate parasaurolophins from lambeosaurins
generally the crests of juveniles of lambeosaurines like corythosaurus lambeosaurus hypacrosaurus stebingeri parasaurolophines like parasaurolophus and primitive lambeosaurines like kazaklambia are quite alike although other features can be used to distinguish them
work by dodson <year> recognized that there were many less taxa present in alberta
tetragonosaurus was found to be juveniles of corythosaurus or lambeosaurus
t
erectofrons was assigned to corythosaurus based largely on biometric information
the only non @-@ typic specimen of tetragonosaurus assigned to t
erectofrons was found later to be referable to hypacrosaurus although the holotype of the species was still found to be assignable to corythosaurus
benson et al
<year> realized that the beak of corythosaurus was shallow and delicate and concluded that it must have been used to feed upon soft vegetation
based on the climate of the late cretaceous they guessed that corythosaurus would have been a selective feeder eating only the juiciest fruits and youngest leaves
corythosaurus specimens have been preserved with its last meal in its chest cavity
inside the cavity were remains of conifer needles seeds twigs and fruits meaning that corythosaurus probably fed on all of these
the oldman formation dates to the campanian about <num>
<num> to <num>
<num> million years ago and the dinosaur park formation dates from <num>
<num> to <num>
<num> million years ago

<num> mya
the holotype specimen was clearly a carcass that had floated up on a beach as unio shells water @-@ worn bones and a baenid turtle were preserved all around
corythosaurus probably lived in a woodland forest and might have occasionally wandered into swampy areas
a limited fauna is known from the upper section of the oldman formation and corythosaurus casuarius as well as c
intermedius are among the taxa
also from the section of the formation are the theropods daspletosaurus and saurornitholestes the hadrosaurids brachylophosaurus gryposaurus and parasaurolophus and the ankylosaurid scolosaurus and the ceratopsians coronosaurus and chasmosaurus
other genera are known but do not persist from the upper section of the formation and therefore are not contemporaries of corythosaurus
corythosaurus casuarius is widespread throughout the lower unit of the dinosaur park formation
in it corythosaurus was found to be closely associated with the ceratopsid centrosaurus apertus
their associating was found in the dinosaur park judith river and mesaverde formations and also in the wind river basin and the wheatland county area
corythosaurus lived alongside numerous other giant herbivores such as the hadrosaurids gryposaurus and parasaurolophus the ceratopsids centrosaurus and chasmosaurus and ankylosaurids scolosaurus edmontonia and dyoplosaurus in the earliest stages of the formation dyoplosaurus panoplosaurus and euoplocephalus in the middle age and euoplocephalus alone in later stages of the formation
studies of the jaw anatomy and mechanics of these dinosaurs suggests they probably all occupied slightly different ecological niches in order to avoid direct competition for food in such a crowded eco @-@ space
the only large predators known from the same levels of the formation as corythosaurus are the tyrannosaurids gorgosaurus libratus and an unnamed species of daspletosaurus
thomas m
lehman has observed that corythosaurus hasn 't been discovered outside of southern alberta even though it is one of the most abundant judithian dinosaurs in the region
large herbivores like the hadrosaurs living in north america during the late cretaceous had remarkably small geographic ranges despite their large body size and high mobility
this restricted distribution strongly contrasts with modern mammalian faunas whose large herbivores ranges typical ly

the film is set in <year> two years after the events of <num> gig
togusa is now the team leader for public security section <num> which has increased considerably in size
section <num> deals with a series of complicated incidents including the assassination of ka rum a former dictator of the siak republic which leads to a terrorist plot using children as vectors for a cybernetic virus
investigations reveal that a hacker nicknamed the the puppeteer is behind the entire series of events
the film which had a production budget of <num> million yen debuted in japan on sky perfectv on september <num> <year> and it was released in north america in <year>
a stereoscopic 3d version of the film was released in <year>
the film received generally positive reviews but was criticized for being very dialogue heavy and lacking in action
chief aramaki conducts a raid to arrest the refugee dictator only to find him already dead
in retaliation a siak operative plans a terrorist attack with a micromachine virus
batou is sent to intercept the siak operative and encounters kusanagi who is conducting her own investigation
before they can apprehend the operative he dies while attacking them
kusanagi takes a case of virus ampules and warns batou to stay away from the solid state society before leaving
section <num> operatives develop a theory that a hacker known as the puppeteer is responsible for siak agents forced suicides and togusa discovers sixteen kidnapped children who were intended carriers of the virus
all the children are listed as the children of noble rot senior citizens and section <num> begins to suspect a larger conspiracy when they are part of a larger body of <num> @,@ <num> children
soon afterwards the puppeteer causes the disappearance of the sixteen children and batou reveals to togusa that he believes kusanagi to be the puppeteer
section <num> next intercepts a siak sniper that is targeting the supposed mastermind of ka rum 's assassination
after his capture it is revealed the informant and the target are one in the same
the sniper says that the puppeteer is a mechanism in the solid state and cannot be killed
togusa tracks down one of the missing children now assigned to an elderly man in the noble rot program
as togusa tries to take the child the man awakens and demands the child be left with him as he had named the child as his sole heir
he would rather give his assets to a child off the street and to protect them from abuse than have his assets turned over to the government upon his death
the man immediately dies after warning togusa not to interfere with the will of the solid state
late togusa receives a call from the puppeteer who hacks his brain and forces him to drive to a cyberbrain implant hospital with his daughter
the puppeteer and togusa converse and togusa is given the option to lose his daughter to the solid state or commit suicide
he chooses suicide but is saved by kusanagi who then identifies the puppeteer as a rhizome formed by the collective consciousness of the noble rot senior citizens located in a welfare center
kusanagi temporarily rejoins section <num> and confirms that ito munei an influential politician was behind the assassination of general ka rum
she also confirms that munei and other politicians use it as a front for a brainwashing facility to create an elite group of pure @-@ blooded japanese to take control of the country in the next generation and lead it into munei 's vision of a new golden age
the solid state decided to eliminate munei for interfering in its plans but munei was ignorant of the origin of the abduction infrastructure
a designer named tateaki koshiki steps forward claiming he developed the solid state system before committing suicide
kusanagi dives into his cyberbrain and into koshiki 's trap allowing him to hack her cyberbrain
the puppetmaster reveals that he was spread across several egos until a collective consciousness emerged and developed into a solid state allowing him to move into the society beyond as the vanishing mediator
later batou tells a recovering kusanagi that the real tateaki koshiki used a cybernetic body and built the solid state after he was hired by munei
kusanagi does not reveal that the puppeteer was a fragment of herself but batou already knew from being linked to her during the dive
batou concludes that the ultimate identity of the puppeteer will remain unknown and that incident will be written off a scandal

<num> kilometers west of elizabeth illinois
the tunnel was completed in <year> for the minnesota and northwestern railroad a predecessor to the chicago great western railway cgw
the tunnel was located on the cgw main line <num> miles <num> kilometers west of chicago in the isolated and hilly driftless area of extreme north @-@ western illinois
in <year> four years after the chicago great western was merged into the chicago and north western railway c nw the cgw 's largely redundant trackage in the area including the winston tunnel was abandoned
it was the third longest railroad tunnel in illinois at <num> @,@ <num> feet <num> m
two longer still active tunnels are located on the canadian national ex @-@ illinois central edgewood cutoff line the longest being tunnel <num> near abbot illinois which is <num> @,@ <num> feet <num> @,@ <num> m long
engineers quickly realized that a tunnel would need to be constructed in order to traverse the rugged landscape
the sheppard winston and company for which the tunnel would be named and more than <num> laborers worked by hand digging through the silty and unstable shale for nine months starting in the spring of <year>
the work was backbreaking and dangerous and at least one worker a thirty @-@ two @-@ year @-@ old finnish immigrant named john hill was killed
when complete the total cost of the tunnel <num> @,@ <num> had exceeded expectations
the tunnel proved to be a constant nuisance to the chicago great western and its predecessors
almost immediately railroad engineers realized that the unstable nature of shale through which the tunnel was bored ground water seepage and the isolated location of the tunnel meant repairs would be frequent and costly
the tunnel was originally braced by wooden beams when it opened to rail traffic in january <year> but these eventually proved inadequate to be replaced in <year> by brick and reinforced concrete
constant deterioration of the supports meant large @-@ scale reconstruction of the tunnel would be needed again in <year> <year> <year> and <year>
the bore was also improperly ventilated at first
a shaft sunk into the top of the tunnel failed to provide enough fresh air and the crews of the steam engines would often complain of the intense heat and smoke due to the poor air circulation
piecemeal solutions failed to work and by <year> the railroad was forced to install a huge fan powered by a <num> horsepower <num> kw diesel motor and staffed by operators day and night to ventilate the tunnel
the fanhouse constructed by <year> was abandoned by the cgw with the acquisition of diesel locomotives by <year>
when the chicago great western was federalized during world war i a contingent of illinois national guardsmen were assigned to protect the tunnel
the operating nightmares of the tunnel not to mention the millions of dollars the cgw spent to keep it open forced the railroad 's management to consider many schemes to rid themselves of the burden
in <year> <year> and again in <year> the same year the north western and great western announced their intentions to merge the cgw sought engineering proposals to reroute their trackage around the bore to daylight the tunnel or to completely rebuild and improve it
to the often cash @-@ strapped great western however all these plans proved far too expensive
in the end the <year> merger with the chicago and north western c nw sealed the winston tunnel 's fate
the great western 's main line through northern illinois closely paralleled the north western 's own line but through less densely populated and less commercially active areas
the steep grades of the line and the obvious financial burden of the winston tunnel also played a role in the decision to completely abandon the great western 's trackage in the area
the c nw operated its last train through the tunnel in <year>
scrappers pulled up the tracks the following year
upon abandonment the c nw placed chain @-@ link fences over each bore of the tunnel to keep squatters and other trespassers out
a <year> attempt to turn the right @-@ of @-@ way through jo daviess county including the winston tunnel into a rail trail failed when ownership of the land reverted to nearby property owners
nature has reclaimed the right @-@ of @-@ way the fan house unused since the <num> and severely damaged by the elements was demolished in early <year> and the eastern bore located on private property has been almost completely sealed with earth
the western half however was purchased by the illinois department of natural resources as a satellite area of apple river canyon state park
the dnr installed a new steel gate to replace the chain @-@ link fence covering the western bore and is developing the area with nature trails and other improvements
however the tunnel is currently off @-@ limits to general public visitation as it is a very dangerous place to visit with the ever @-@ present danger of further collapse and rattlesnake bite

wales conducted their first overseas tour in <year> playing several games and one test in south africa
they lost the test against south africa in durban <num> – <num> their biggest defeat in <num> years
at the wru annual general meeting that year the outgoing wru president d
ewart davies declared that it was evident from the experience of the south african tour that a much more positive attitude to the game was required in wales
players must be prepared to learn and indeed re @-@ learn to the absolute point of mastery the basic principles of rugby union football
this started the coaching revolution
the wru coaching committee – set up in the late <num> – was given the task of improving the quality of coaching and in january <year> ray williams was appointed coaching organiser
the first national coach david nash was appointed in <year> to coach wales for the season but resigned when the wru refused to allow him to accompany wales on their <year> tour of argentina

wales contributed more players than any other team to the british and irish lions that toured new zealand that year
those lions became the only to win a series over the all blacks
in the <year> five nations championship wales and scotland refused to travel to ireland at the height of the troubles after receiving threats purportedly from the irish republican army
the championship remained unresolved with wales and ireland unbeaten
although the five nations was a five way tie in <year> the welsh did defeat australia <num> – <num> in cardiff
wales next won the five nations outright in <year> and in <year> wales won their second grand slam of the decade
just like the first in <year> they only used <num> players over their four matches
they repeated the feat in <year> and in the process became the first team to win three consecutive triple crowns
following their final five nations match of <year> both phil bennett and gareth edwards retired from rugby
wales hosted the all blacks at cardiff arms park in november <year> losing <num> – <num> after a late penalty goal by the replacement all black fullback brian mckechnie
the penalty was controversial because all black lock andy haden had dived out of a line @-@ out in an attempt to earn a penalty
haden later admitted that he and frank oliver had pre @-@ agreed this tactic should the all blacks find themselves in difficulties
referee roger quittenton was roasted by the press for failing to notice the dive but he later stated he had the penalty was in for welsh lock geoff wheel for jumping off the shoulder of frank oliver
quittenton later said haden 's perception is that his dive secured the penalty
that is a load of rubbish
the all blacks went on to secure their first home nations grand slam
wales then went on to win the <year> five nations with a triple crown

at the <year> world cup after comprehensively beating japan wales lost to new zealand this meant that they needed to defeat ireland to qualify for the quarter @-@ finals
wales lost <num> – <num> and so failed to progress beyond the pool stage for the second time and later that year kevin bowring replaced alex evans to become wales first full @-@ time coach
record defeats <num> – <num> to france and <num> – <num> to south africa prompted the wru to appoint new zealander graham henry as coach in <year>
henry had early success as coach leading wales to a ten @-@ match winning streak this included wales first ever victory over south africa by <num> – <num>
henry was consequently nicknamed the great redeemer by the welsh media and fans
hosting the <year> world cup wales qualified for the quarter @-@ finals for the first time since <year> but lost <num> – <num> to eventual champions australia
a lack of success in the five and six nations italy joined the tournament in <year> and especially a number of heavy losses to ireland led to henry 's resignation in february <year> his assistant steve hansen took over

after debate and disputes between the wru and various other parties including cardiff rfc in the <num> it was decided that a new national stadium would be built with a new ground for the cardiff club backing onto it
the national stadium as it was known was officially opened in <year>
currently wales play all their home matches at the <num> @,@ <num> capacity millennium stadium cardiff which is also wales national stadium
the millennium stadium was first conceived in <year> when a group redevelopment committee was set up

‡ – denotes dual contracted players
it is one of the most important and fundamental doctrines of jainism
jains contrast all attempts to proclaim the sole monopoly on truth with andhagajanyāyah which can be illustrated through the parable of the blind men and an elephant
in this story each blind man felt a different part of an elephant trunk leg ear etc

all the men claimed to understand and explain the true appearance of the elephant but could only partly succeed due to their limited perspectives
this principle is more formally stated by observing that objects are infinite in their qualities and modes of existence so they cannot be completely grasped in all aspects and manifestations by finite human perception
this is the absolute truth
according to the jains only the kevalis — omniscient beings — can comprehend objects in all aspects and manifestations others are only capable of partial knowledge
consequently no single specific human view can claim to represent absolute truth
the origins of anekāntavāda can be traced back to the teachings of mahāvīra <num> – <num> bce the <num> jain tīrthankara
the dialectical concepts of syādvāda conditioned viewpoints and nayavāda partial viewpoints arose from anekāntavāda providing it with more detailed logical structure and expression
the sanskrit compound an @-@ eka @-@ anta @-@ vāda literally means doctrine of uncertainty an- not ekānta certainty or single @-@ natured vāda school of thought or thesis it is roughly translated into english as non @-@ absolutism
an @-@ ekānta uncertainty non @-@ exclusivity is the opposite of ekānta eka anta exclusiveness absoluteness necessity or also monotheistic doctrine
anekāntavāda encourages its adherents to consider the views and beliefs of their rivals and opposing parties
proponents of anekāntavāda apply this principle to religion and philosophy reminding themselves that any religion or philosophy — even jainism — which clings too dogmatically to its own tenets is committing an error based on its limited point of view
the principle of anekāntavāda also influenced mahatma gandhi to adopt principles of religious tolerance ahiṃsā and satyagraha
the word anekānta is a compound of the sanskrit negative prefix an eka one and anta attribute
hence anekānta means not of solitary attribute
the jain doctrine lays a strong emphasis on samyaktva that is rationality and logic
according to jains the ultimate principle should always be logical and no principle can be devoid of logic or reason
thus the jain texts contain deliberative exhortations on every subject whether they are constructive or obstructive inferential or analytical enlightening or destructive
the other two are syādvāda — the theory of conditioned predication and nayavāda — the theory of partial standpoints
these jain philosophical concepts made important contributions to ancient indian philosophy especially in the areas of skepticism and relativity
e
generally by prefacing each sentence with the verb syāt the third person singular optative of the sanskrit verb as to be
in sanskrit syāt becomes syān when followed by an n and syād when followed by a non @-@ nasal voiced consonant or vowel
according to jain texts a thing or object of knowledge has infinite characters i
e
it is anekāntātmaka each character can be analysed and grasped individually
each individual character is called a naya
jains asserts that a naya reveals only a part of the totality and should not be mistaken for the whole
a synthesis of different viewpoints is said to be achieved by the doctrine of conditional predications syādvāda wherein every viewpoint is able to retain its relative importance
highlighting the indispensability of syādvāda acharya samantabhadra asserts affirmation when not in conflict with negation yields the desired result of describing truly an object of knowledge
only when affirmation and negation are juxtaposed in mutually non @-@ conflicting situation one is able to decide whether to accept or reject the assertion
this is how the doctrine of conditional predications syādvāda establishes the truth
” syādvāda is not only an extension of anekānta ontology but a separate system of logic capable of standing on its own
as reality is complex no single proposition can express the nature of reality fully
thus syāt should be prefixed before each proposition giving it a conditional point of view and thus removing any dogmatism in the statement
since it ensures that each statement is expressed from seven different conditional and relative viewpoints or propositions syādvāda is known as saptibhaṅgīnāya or the theory of seven conditioned predications
these saptibhaṅgī are syād @-@ asti — in some ways it is syān @-@ nāsti — in some ways it is not syād @-@ asti @-@ nāsti — in some ways it is and it is not syād @-@ asti @-@ avaktavyaḥ — in some ways it is and it is indescribable syān @-@ nāsti @-@ avaktavyaḥ — in some ways it is not and it is indescribable syād @-@ asti @-@ nāsti @-@ avaktavyaḥ — in some ways it is it is not and it is indescribable syād @-@ avaktavyaḥ — in some ways it is indescribable
each of these seven propositions examines the complex and multifaceted nature of reality from a relative point of view of time space substance and mode
to ignore the complexity of reality is to commit the fallacy of dogmatism
the phrase ‘ in a way ’ syāt declares the standpoint of expression – affirmation with regard to own substance dravya place kṣetra time kāla and being bhāva and negation with regard to other substance dravya place kṣetra time kāla and being bhāva
thus for a ‘ jar ’ in regard to substance dravya – earthen it simply is wooden it simply is not
in regard to place kṣetra – room it simply is terrace it simply is not
in regard to time kāla – summer it simply is winter it simply is not
in regard to being bhāva – brown it simply is white it simply is not
and the word ‘ simply ’ has been inserted for the purpose of excluding a sense not approved by the ‘ nuance ’ for avoidance of a meaning not intended
the phrase ‘ in a way ’ is used to declare that the ‘ jar ’ exists in regard to its own substance etc
and not also in regard to other substance etc
according to the jains syādvāda and kevalajñāna omniscience are the foundational facts of knowledge
in this regard āchārya samantabhadra writes syādvāda the doctrine of conditional predications and kevalajñāna omniscience are both illuminators of the substances of reality
the difference between the two is that while kevalajñāna illumines directly syādvāda illumines indirectly
anything which is not illuminated or expressed by the two is not a substance of reality and hence a non @-@ substance avastu
nayavāda is a compound of two sanskrit words — naya reason or method and vāda school of thought or thesis
it is used to arrive at a certain inference from a point of view
an object has infinite aspects to it but when we describe an object in practice we speak of only relevant aspects and ignore irrelevant ones
this does not deny the other attributes qualities modes and other aspects they are just irrelevant from a particular perspective
authors like natubhai shah explain nayavāda with the example of a car for instance when we talk of a blue bmw we are simply considering the color and make of the car
however our statement does not imply that the car is devoid of other attributes like engine type cylinders speed price and the like
this particular viewpoint is called a naya or a partial viewpoint
as a type of critical philosophy nayavāda holds that all philosophical disputes arise out of confusion of standpoints and the standpoints we adopt are although we may not realise it the outcome of purposes that we may pursue
while operating within the limits of language and seeing the complex nature of reality mahāvīra used the language of nayas
naya being a partial expression of truth enables us to comprehend reality part by part
upanishadic thought postulated the absolute unchanging reality of brahman and ātman and claimed that change was mere illusion
the theory advanced by buddhists denied the reality of permanence of conditioned phenomena asserting only interdependence and impermanence
according to the vedāntin upanishadic conceptual scheme the buddhists were wrong in denying permanence and absolutism and within the buddhist conceptual scheme the vedāntins were wrong in denying the reality of impermanence
the two positions were contradictory and mutually exclusive from each other 's point of view
the jains managed a synthesis of the two uncompromising positions with anekāntavāda
from the perspective of a higher inclusive level made possible by the ontology and epistemology of anekāntavāda and syādvāda jains do not see such claims as contradictory or mutually exclusive instead they are seen as ekantika or only partially true
the jain breadth of vision embraces the perspectives of both vedānta which according to jainism recognises substances but not process and buddhism which recognises process but not substance
jainism on the other hand pays equal attention to both substance dravya and process paryaya
this philosophical syncretisation of paradox of change through anekānta has been acknowledged by modern scholars such as arvind sharma who wrote our experience of the world presents a profound paradox which we can ignore existentially but not philosophically
this paradox is the paradox of change
something – a changes and therefore it cannot be permanent
on the other hand if a is not permanent then what changes in this debate between the permanence and change hinduism seems more inclined to grasp the first horn of the dilemma and buddhism the second
it is jainism that has the philosophical courage to grasp both horns fearlessly and simultaneously and the philosophical skill not to be gored by either
however anekāntavāda is not simply about syncretisation or compromise between competing ideas as it is cooperatively about finding the hidden elements of shared truth between such ideas such as naturalism — relative to pantheism and sanctuary — although its basis in simplicity may be described with the scientific principle of occam 's razor — whereas science is likewise paradoxical in nature — relative to nonviolence
anekāntavāda is not about denying the truth rather truth is acknowledged as an ultimate spiritual goal
for ordinary humans it is an elusive goal but they are still obliged to work towards its attainment
anekāntavāda also does not mean compromising or diluting ones own values and principles
on the contrary it allows us to understand and be tolerant of conflicting and opposing views while respectfully maintaining the validity of ones own view @-@ point
hence john koller calls anekāntavāda as – epistemological respect for view of others
anekāntavāda thus did not prevent the jain thinkers from defending the truth and validity of their own doctrine while simultaneously respecting and understanding the rival doctrines
anne vallely notes that the epistemological respect for other viewpoints was put to practice when she was invited by ācārya tulsi the head of the terāpanthī order to teach sadhvis the tenets of christianity
commenting on their adherence to ahiṃsā and anekāntavāda she says the jain samaṇīs of ladnun uncompromisingly maintain ahiṃsā to be an eternal and unchangeable moral law
other views and beliefs that contradict this belief would certainly be challenged and ultimately rejected
but what is significant is that both the rejection and retention of views is tempered by the belief that our perception conveys only a partial reality that reality itself is manifold and that to assume one particular viewpoint is final is to hold a limited picture of reality
anekāntavāda is also different from moral relativism
it does not mean conceding that all arguments and all views are equal but rather logic and evidence determine which views are true in what respect and to what extent as truth in relativism itself
while employing anekāntavāda the <num> century philosopher monk yaśovijaya gaṇi also cautions against anābhigrahika indiscriminate attachment to all views as being true which is effectively a kind of misconceived relativism
jains thus consider anekāntavāda as a positive concept corresponding to religious pluralism that transcends monism and dualism implying a sophisticated conception of a complex reality
it does not merely involve rejection of partisanship but reflects a positive spirit of reconciliation of opposite views
however it is argued that pluralism often degenerates to some form of moral relativism or religious exclusivism
according to anne vallely anekānta is a way out of this epistemological quagmire as it makes a genuinely pluralistic view possible without lapsing into extreme moral relativism or exclusivity
a group of blind men heard that a strange animal called an elephant had been brought to the town but none of them were aware of its shape and form
out of curiosity they said we must inspect and know it by touch of which we are capable
so they sought it out and when they found it they groped about it
in the case of the first person whose hand landed on the trunk said this being is like a drain pipe
for another one whose hand reached its ear it seemed like a kind of fan
as for another person whose hand was upon its leg said i perceive the shape of the elephant to be like a pillar
and in the case of the one who placed his hand upon its back said indeed this elephant is like a throne
now each of these presented a true aspect when he related what he had gained from experiencing the elephant
none of them had strayed from the true description of the elephant
yet they fell short of fathoming the true appearance of the elephant
two of the many references to this parable are found in tattvarthaslokavatika of vidyanandi <num> century and syādvādamanjari of ācārya mallisena <num> century
mallisena uses the parable to argue that immature people deny various aspects of truth deluded by the aspects they do understand they deny the aspects they don 't understand
due to extreme delusion produced on account of a partial viewpoint the immature deny one aspect and try to establish another
this is the maxim of the blind men and the elephant
mallisena also cites the parable when noting the importance of considering all viewpoints in obtaining a full picture of reality
it is impossible to properly understand an entity consisting of infinite properties without the method of modal description consisting of all viewpoints since it will otherwise lead to a situation of seizing mere sprouts i
e
a superficial inadequate cognition on the maxim of the blind men and the elephant
the development of anekāntavāda also encouraged the development of the dialectics of syādvāda conditioned viewpoints saptibhaṅgī the seven conditioned predication and nayavāda partial viewpoints
taking a relativistic viewpoint mahāvīra is said to have explained the nature of the soul as both permanent from the point of view of underlying substance and temporary from the point of view of its modes and modification
the importance and antiquity of anekāntavāda are also demonstrated by the fact that it formed the subject matter of astinasti pravāda the fourth part of the lost purva that contained teachings of the tīrthaṇkaras prior to mahāvīra
german indologist hermann jacobi believes mahāvīra effectively employed the dialectics of anekāntavāda to refute the agnosticism of sañjaya belaṭṭhaputta
sutrakritanga the second oldest canon of jainism contains the first references to syādvāda and saptibhaṅgī
according to sūtrakritanga mahāvīra advised his disciples to use syādvāda to preach his teachings a monk living single should not ridicule heretical doctrines and should avoid hard words though they be true he should not be vain nor brag but he should without embarrassment and passion preach the law
a monk should be modest though he be of a fearless mind he should expound the syādvāda he should use the two permitted kinds of speech living among virtuous men impartial and wise
śvētāmbara text sutrakritanga contains references to vibhagyavāda which according to hermann jacobi is the same as syādvāda and saptibhaṅgī
bhagvatisūtra mentions only three primary predications of the saptibhaṅgīnaya
after mahāvīra kundakunda 1st century ce was the first author – saint to expound on the doctrine of syādvāda and saptibhaṅgī and give it a proper structure in his famous works pravacanasāra and pancastikayasāra
kundakunda also used nayas to discuss the essence of the self in samayasāra
proper classification of the nayas was provided by the philosopher monk umāsvāti <num> century ce in tattvārthasūtra
samantabhadra <num> century ce and siddhasena divākara <num> century ce further fine @-@ tuned jain epistemology and logic by expounding on the concepts of anekāntavāda in proper form and structure
ācārya siddhasena divākara expounded on the nature of truth in the court of king vikramāditya vikramāditya what is truth that which is said repeatedly that which is said loudly that which is said with authority or that which is agreed by the majority divākara none of the above
every one has his own definition of truth and that it is conditional
vikramāditya how about traditions they have been established by our ancestors and have passed the test of time divākara would the system established by ancestors hold true on examination in case it does not i am not here to justify it for the sake of saving the traditional grace of the dead irrespective of the wrath i may have to face
in sanmatitarka divākara further adds all doctrines are right in their own respective spheres — but if they encroach upon the province of other doctrines and try to refute their view they are wrong
a man who holds the view of the cumulative character of truth never says that a particular view is right or that a particular view is wrong
by the time of akalanka <num> century ce whose works are a landmark in jain logic anekāntavāda was firmly entrenched in jain texts as is evident from the various teachings of the jain scriptures
ācārya haribhadra <num> century ce was one of the leading proponents of anekāntavāda
he was the first classical author to write a doxography a compendium of a variety of intellectual views
this attempted to contextualise jain thoughts within the broad framework rather than espouse narrow partisan views
it interacted with the many possible intellectual orientations available to indian thinkers around the <num> century
ācārya amrtacandra starts his famous <num> century ce work purusathasiddhiupaya with strong praise for anekāntavāda i bow down to the principle of anekānta the source and foundation of the highest scriptures the dispeller of wrong one @-@ sided notions that which takes into account all aspects of truth reconciling diverse and even contradictory traits of all objects or entity
ācārya vidyānandi <num> century ce provides the analogy of the ocean to explain the nature of truth in tattvarthaslokavārtikka <num> water from the ocean contained in a pot can neither be called an ocean nor a non @-@ ocean but simply a part of ocean
similarly a doctrine though arising from absolute truth can neither be called a whole truth nor a non @-@ truth
yaśovijaya gaṇi a <num> @-@ century jain monk went beyond anekāntavāda by advocating madhāyastha meaning standing in the middle or equidistance
this position allowed him to praise qualities in others even though the people were non @-@ jain and belonged to other faiths
there was a period of stagnation after yasovijayaji as there were no new contributions to the development of jain philosophy
according to hermann jacobi mahāvīra used such concepts as syādvāda and saptbhangi to silence some of his opponents
the discussions of the agnostics led by sañjaya belaṭṭhaputta had probably influenced many of their contemporaries and consequently syādvāda may have seemed to them a way out of ajñānavāda
jacobi further speculates that many of their followers would have gone over to mahāvīra 's creed convinced of the truth of the saptbhanginaya
according to professor christopher key chapple anekāntavāda allowed jains to survive during the most hostile and unfavourable moments in history
according to john koller professor of asian studies anekāntavāda allowed jain thinkers to maintain the validity of their doctrine while at the same time respectfully criticizing the views of their opponents
anekāntavāda was often used by jain monks to obtain royal patronage from hindu kings
ācārya hemacandra used anekāntavāda to gain the confidence and respect of the cālukya emperor jayasimha siddharaja
according to the jain text prabandhacantamani emperor siddharaja desired enlightenment and liberation and he questioned teachers from various traditions
he remained in a quandary when he discovered that they all promoted their own teachings while disparaging other teachings
among the teachers he questioned was hemacandra who rather than promote jainism told him a story with a different message
according to his story a sick man was cured of his disease after eating all the herbs available as he was not aware which herb was medicinal
the moral of the tale according to hemacandra was that just as the man was restored by the herb even though no one knew which particular herb did the trick so in the kaliyuga age of vice the wise should obtain salvation by supporting all religious traditions even though no @-@ one can say with absolute certainty which tradition it is that provides that salvation
it can be traced to the analogous jain principles of anekāntavāda and ahiṃsā
the epistemology of anekāntavāda and syādvāda also had a profound impact on the development of ancient indian logic and philosophy
in recent times jainism influenced gandhi who advocated ahiṃsā and satyagraha
anekāntavāda is non @-@ absolutist and stands firmly against all dogmatisms including any assertion that jainism is the only correct religious path
it is thus an intellectual ahiṃsā or ahiṃsā of the mind
burch writes jain logic is intellectual ahiṃsā
just as a right @-@ acting person respects the life of all beings so a right @-@ thinking person acknowledges the validity of all judgments
this means recognizing all aspects of reality not merely one or some aspects as is done in non @-@ jain philosophies
mahāvīra encouraged his followers to study and understand rival traditions in his acaranga sutra comprehend one philosophical view through the comprehensive study of another one
in anekāntavāda there is no battle of ideas because this is considered to be a form of intellectual himsa or violence leading quite logically to physical violence and war
in today 's world the limitations of the adversarial either with us or against us form of argument are increasingly apparent by the fact that the argument leads to political religious and social conflicts
sūtrakrtānga the second oldest canon of jainism provides a solution by stating those who praise their own doctrines and ideology and disparage the doctrine of others distort the truth and will be confined to the cycle of birth and death
this ecumenical and irenical attitude engendered by anekāntavāda allowed modern jain monks such as vijayadharmasuri to declare i am neither a jain nor a buddhist a vaisnava nor a saivite a hindu nor a muslim but a traveler on the path of peace shown by the supreme soul the god who is free from passion
they claim that even the mounting ecological crisis is linked to adversarialism because it arises from a false division between humanity and the rest of nature
modern judicial systems democracy freedom of speech and secularism all implicitly reflect an attitude of anekāntavāda
many authors such as kamla jain have claimed that the jain tradition with its emphasis on ahimsā and anekāntavāda is capable of solving religious intolerance terrorism wars the depletion of natural resources environmental degradation and many other problems
referring to the september <num> attacks john koller believes that violence in society mainly exists due to faulty epistemology and metaphysics as well as faulty ethics
a failure to respect the life and views of others rooted in dogmatic and mistaken knowledge and refusal to acknowledge the legitimate claims of different perspectives leads to violent and destructive behaviour
koller suggests that anekāntavāda has a larger role to play in the world peace
according to koller because anekāntavāda is designed to avoid one @-@ sided errors reconcile contradictory viewpoints and accept the multiplicity and relativity of truth the jain philosophy is in a unique position to support dialogue and negotiations amongst various nations and peoples
some indologists like professor john cort have cautioned against giving undue importance to intellectual ahiṃsā as the basis of anekāntavāda
he points out that jain monks have also used anekāntavāda and syādvāda as debating weapons to silence their critics and prove the validity of the jain doctrine over others
according to dundas in jain hands this method of analysis became a fearsome weapon of philosophical polemic with which the doctrines of hinduism and buddhism could be pared down to their ideological bases of simple permanence and impermanence respectively and thus could be shown to be one @-@ pointed and inadequate as the overall interpretations of reality they purported to be
on the other hand the many @-@ sided approach was claimed by the jains to be immune from criticism since it did not present itself as a philosophical or dogmatic view
according to biographers like uma majumdar rajmohan gandhi and stephen hay these early childhood impressions and experiences contributed to the formation of gandhi 's character and his further moral and spiritual development
in his writings mahatma gandhi attributed his seemingly contradictory positions over a period of time to the learning process experiments with truth and his belief in anekāntavāda
he proclaimed that the duty of every individual is to determine what is personally true and act on that relative perception of truth
according to gandhi a satyagrahi is duty bound to act according to his relative truth but at the same time he is also equally bound to learn from truth held by his opponent
in response to a friend 's query on religious tolerance he responded in the journal young india – <num> jan <year> i am an advaitist and yet i can support dvaitism dualism
the world is changing every moment and is therefore unreal it has no permanent existence
but though it is constantly changing it has a something about it which persists and it is therefore to that extent real
i have therefore no objection to calling it real and unreal and thus being called an anekāntavadi or a syādvadi
but my syādvāda is not the syādvāda of the learned it is peculiarly my own
i cannot engage in a debate with them
it has been my experience that i am always true from my point of view and am often wrong from the point of view of my honest critics
i know that we are both right from our respective points of view
and this knowledge saves me from attributing motives to my opponents or critics
the seven blind men who gave seven different descriptions of the elephant were all right from their respective points of view and wrong from the point of view of one another and right and wrong from the point of view of the man who knew the elephant
i very much like this doctrine of the manyness of reality
it is this doctrine that has taught me to judge a musulman from his standpoint and a christian from his
formerly i used to resent the ignorance of my opponents
today i can love them because i am gifted with the eye to see myself as others see me and vice versa
i want to take the whole world in the embrace of my love
my anekāntavāda is the result of the twin doctrine of satyagraha and ahiṃsā
it is also pointed out that jain epistemology asserts its own doctrines but at the cost of being unable to deny contradictory doctrines
furthermore it is also argued that this doctrine could be self @-@ defeating
it is argued that if reality is so complex that no single doctrine can describe it adequately then anekāntavāda itself being a single doctrine must be inadequate
this criticism seems to have been anticipated by ācārya samantabhadra who said from the point of view of pramana means of knowledge it is anekānta multi @-@ sided but from a point of view of naya partial view it is ekanta one @-@ sided
in defense of the doctrine jains point out that anekāntavāda seeks to reconcile apparently opposing viewpoints rather than refuting them
anekāntavāda received much criticism from the vedantists notably adi sankarācārya <num> century c
e

sankara argued against some tenets of jainism in his bhasya on brahmasutra <num> <num> <num> – <num>
his main arguments centre on anekāntavāda it is impossible that contradictory attributes such as being and non @-@ being should at the same time belong to one and the same thing just as observation teaches us that a thing cannot be hot and cold at the same moment
the third alternative expressed in the words — they either are such or not such — results in cognition of indefinite nature which is no more a source of true knowledge than doubt is
thus the means of knowledge the object of knowledge the knowing subject and the act of knowledge become all alike indefinite
how can his followers act on a doctrine the matter of which is altogether indeterminate the result of your efforts is perfect knowledge and is not perfect knowledge
observation shows that only when a course of action is known to have a definite result people set about it without hesitation
hence a man who proclaims a doctrine of altogether indefinite contents does not deserve to be listened any more than a drunken or a mad man
however many believe that sankara fails to address genuine anekāntavāda
by identifying syādavāda with sansayavāda he instead addresses agnosticism which was argued by sañjaya belaṭṭhaputta
many authors like pandya believe that sankara overlooked that the affirmation of the existence of an object is in respect to the object itself and its negation is in respect to what the object is not
genuine anekāntavāda thus considers positive and negative attributes of an object at the same time and without any contradictions
another buddhist logician dharmakirti ridiculed anekāntavāda in pramānavarttikakārika with the differentiation removed all things have dual nature
then if somebody is implored to eat curd then why he does not eat camel the insinuation is obvious if curd exists from the nature of curd and does not exist from the nature of a camel then one is justified in eating camel as by eating camel he is merely eating the negation of curd
ācārya akalanka while agreeing that dharmakirti may be right from one viewpoint took it upon himself to issue a rejoinder the person who criticises without understanding the prima facie view is acting like a jester and not a critic
the buddha was born a deer and the deer was born as buddha but buddha is adorable and deer is only a food
similarly due to the strength of an entity with its differences and similarities specified nobody would eat camel if implored to eat curd
it was established in <year> and is home to <year> graves from the second world war
most of the men buried in the cemetery were allied servicemen killed in the battle of arnhem an allied attempt to cross the rhine in <year> or in the liberation of the city the following year
men killed in these battles are still discovered in the surrounding area even in the 21st century and so the number of people interred in the cemetery continues to grow
the operation required the 1st airborne corps to seize several bridges over rivers and canals in the netherlands allowing ground forces to advance rapidly through the netherlands and cross the river rhine
the british 1st airborne division was tasked with securing the most distant objectives bridges over the lower rhine at arnhem
the division dropped onto the area on <num> september and a small force was able to secure the arnhem road bridge
however the unexpected presence of ss panzer troops of the ii ss panzerkorps meant the allies were never able to fully secure their objectives and so after nine days without sufficient reinforcement by the advancing ground forces the division was withdrawn on <num> september
in the <num> days of battle almost <year> allied soldiers were killed some of whom died of their wounds or in captivity after the battle
these included over <num> men of the british 1st airborne division <num> men of the glider pilot regiment <num> men of the polish 1st independent parachute brigade <num> men of the raf <num> re @-@ supply dispatchers of the rasc <num> men of xxx corps and <num> men of us ix troop carrier command
the exact number of german dead is unknown but is believed to be at least <num>
additionally it is believed <num> dutch civilians were killed during the battle
here they were buried in simple field graves some little more than their own slit trenches or in small mass graves dug by the germans
kate ter horst whose house was used as a first aid post during the battle found the graves of <num> men in her garden when she returned after the war
after arnhem was liberated in april <year> grave registration units of the british <num> army moved into the area and began to locate the allied dead
a small field north of oosterbeek was offered on perpetual loan by the netherlands government to the imperial war graves commission now commonwealth war graves commission in june <year> and the dead were reburied there
many of those killed during arnhem 's liberation were also buried at the same site
the cemetery was completed in february <year> originally with the graves marked by metal crosses although these were replaced by headstones in <year>
most of the german dead were buried in the ss heroes cemetery near arnhem after the battle but reburied in ysselsteyn german war cemetery after the war
the commonwealth war graves commission records <year> graves in the cemetery as of <year>
<year> of these are commonwealth including british canadian australian and new zealanders
the cemetery is also the last resting place of <num> polish soldiers many of them exhumed and moved from driel to the disappointment of driel 's residents and <num> dutch civilians – some killed in the fighting and some former commission employees
<num> of the graves are unidentified
as of <year> there were still <num> allied men with no known grave in the area and they are commemorated at the groesbeek memorial
however evidence of the battle is often discovered even today and the bodies of allied servicemen are reinterred at the airborne cemetery
when found bodies are exhumed and dutch graves registration staff attempt to identify them before they are reburied
one soldier of the border regiment was discovered and reburied in the cemetery in <year> and another who had previously been unidentified was reburied in <year>
five men were awarded the victoria cross after the battle four of them posthumously
three of the men now rest in the cemetery lieutenant john hollington grayburn of the <num> battalion parachute regiment flight lieutenant david samuel anthony lord of <num> squadron royal air force and captain lionel ernest queripel of the <num> battalion parachute regiment
lance @-@ sergeant john daniel baskeyfield of the <num> battalion south staffordshire regiment has no known grave and is commemorated instead at groesbeek memorial
major robert henry cain also of <num> battalion south staffordshire regiment survived the battle and was buried on the isle of man when he died in <year>
opposite the airborne cemetery is a civilian graveyard with a small commonwealth war graves commission plot containing the graves of nine airmen shot down shortly before the battle
it is also home to lipmann kessel a surgeon with the <num> parachute field ambulance during the battle who wished to be buried near his men after his death in <year>
similarly the moscowa cemetery three miles east contains the graves of thirty six aircrew killed before the battle and one unidentified soldier
not all of the allied dead from the battle of arnhem are interred at the cemetery
some <num> men who were killed when flying into battle while trying to escape or who succumbed to wounds later are buried in civilian cemeteries in the netherlands belgium the uk and the usa
sixty men who died in prisoner of war camps after the battle are buried in germany
while there they attended the first commemorative event at the cemetery
this event continued every year and was attended by veterans local residents and over <num> school children who laid flowers on the graves of the dead
after the <num> anniversary in <year> the parachute regiment approached dutch organisers to suggest ending the ceremony believing the battle to have passed sufficiently into history
the dutch were vehemently and emotionally opposed to the idea and thus the ceremony continues to be held annually
the first entry in the series phoenix wright ace attorney was released in <year> since then nine further games have been released
additionally the series has seen adaptations in the form of a live action film and an anime and has been the base for manga series drama cds musicals and stage plays
the player takes the roles of the defense attorneys phoenix wright mia fey apollo justice and athena cykes and investigates cases and defends their clients in court they find the truth by cross @-@ examining witnesses and finding inconsistencies between the testimonies and the evidence they have collected

in the spin @-@ off series ace attorney investigations the player takes the role of prosecutor miles edgeworth and in the spin @-@ off dai gyakuten saiban they play as phoenix 's ancestor ryūnosuke naruhodō
the series was created by the writer and director shu takumi who wanted the series to end after the third game
the series still continued with takeshi yamazaki taking over as writer and director starting with ace attorney investigations miles edgeworth <year> takumi has since returned to write and direct some spin @-@ off titles
while the original japanese versions of the games are set in japan the series localizations are set in the united states though retaining japanese cultural influence
the series has been well received with reviewers liking the characters and story and the finding of contradictions it has also performed well commercially with capcom regarding it as one of their strongest intellectual properties
the series currently consists of six main series games and four spin @-@ offs

it was released for the nintendo 3ds in <year> in japan and in <year> in the west
dai gyakuten saiban naruhodō ryūnosuke no bōken is the first entry in a planned spin @-@ off series
it was released for the nintendo 3ds in <year> in japan but is not intended to be released in the west
the gameplay is split into two types of sections investigations and courtroom trials
during the investigations the player searches the environments gathering information and evidence and talks to characters such as their client witnesses and the police
once enough evidence has been collected the game moves on to a courtroom trial section
in the courtroom trials the player aims to get their client declared not guilty
to do so they cross @-@ examine witnesses and aim to find lies and inconsistencies in the testimonies
they are able to go back and forth between the different statements in the testimony and can press the witness for more details on a statement
when the player finds an inconsistency they can present a piece of evidence that contradicts the statement
the player is penalized if they present incorrect evidence in the first game a number of exclamation marks is shown with one disappearing after each mistake the player makes in later games a health bar that represents the judge 's patience is used instead
if all exclamation marks are lost or the health bar reaches zero the player loses the game and their client is declared guilty
several ace attorney games introduce new gameplay mechanics to the series
justice for all introduces psyche @-@ locks which are shown over a witness when the player asks them about a topic they do not want to discuss using a magatama the player can start breaking the psyche @-@ locks by showing the witness evidence or character profiles that proves they are hiding something
the number of psyche @-@ locks depends on how deep the secret is when all locks are broken the topic becomes available giving the player access to new information
apollo justice introduces the perceive system where the player looks for motions or actions made by witnesses that show nervousness similar to a tell in poker
dual destinies introduces the mood matrix through which the player can gauge the emotions of a witness such as tones of anger when mentioning certain topics if the player notices a contradictory emotional response during testimony they can point out the discrepancy and press the witness for more information
dual destinies also introduces revisualization where the player reviews vital facts and forms links between evidence to reach new conclusions
spirit of justice introduces divination séances in which the player is shown the memories of victims moments before their deaths and must find contradictions in the victim 's five senses to determine what has happened
professor layton vs
phoenix wright ace attorney introduces simultaneous cross @-@ examinations of multiple witnesses with the player being able to see and hear reactions from the different witnesses to the testimony and using this to find contradictions
dai gyakuten saiban introduces joint reasoning where the player finds out the truth by pointing out when their investigative partner sherlock holmes takes his reasoning further than the truth
the ace attorney investigations spin @-@ off series splits the gameplay into investigation phases and rebuttal phases the latter of which is similar to the courtroom trials of the main series
during the investigation phases the player searches for evidence and talks to witnesses and suspects
things the player character notices in the environment are saved as thoughts the player can use the logic system to connect two such thoughts to gain access to new information
at some points the player can create hologram reproductions of the crime scene through which they can discover new information that would otherwise be hidden
ace attorney investigations <num> introduces logic chess where the player interrogates witnesses in a timed sequence that is visualized as a game of chess with the player aiming to destroy the other character 's chess pieces
to do this they need to build up their advantage in the discussion by alternating between speaking and listening and then choose to go on the offensive
in the fourth game the protagonist is the defense attorney apollo justice in the fifth phoenix apollo and the new defense attorney athena cykes are all protagonists and in the sixth phoenix and apollo are the protagonists
the spin @-@ off dai gyakuten saiban is set in england near the end of the <num> century and follows phoenix 's ancestor ryūnosuke naruhodō
phoenix 's childhood friend miles edgeworth who is the protagonist of the ace attorney investigations games is a recurring rival prosecutor character in addition to him each new game in the series introduces a new rival franziska von karma is introduced in the second game godot in the third klavier gavin in the fourth simon blackquill in the fifth and nahyuta sahdmadhi in the sixth
the prosecutor characters are portrayed as powerful and arrogant characters of high social status who favor convictions over finding the truth and who care about keeping perfect @-@ win records in court
similarly to real japanese prosecutors the prosecutors in the series often directly oversee investigations issuing orders to the police
japanese attitudes towards the police force are reflected in the series with the police being represented by incompetent characters such as dick gumshoe maggey byrde and mike meekins
in the world of ace attorney trials only last three days and usually end with a guilty verdict
the outcomes of cases are decided by a judge based on evidence provided by the defense attorney and the prosecutor
the first game was conceived in <year> when takumi 's boss at the time shinji mikami gave him six months to create any type of game he wanted to takumi had originally joined capcom wanting to make mystery and adventure games and felt that this was a big chance for him to make a mark as a creator
the game was designed to be simple as takumi wanted it to be easy enough for even his mother to play
it was originally going to be a detective game with phoenix being a private investigator but at one point takumi realized that finding and taking apart contradictions was not related to detective work and felt that the main setting of the game should be courtrooms
takumi felt that the best way to write a mystery with a good climax is to reveal various clues and then pull them together into one conclusion and not have multiple possible endings
he said that the biggest challenge with that was to make the gameplay and story work together the goal was to make the player feel like they have driven the story forward themselves with their own choices even though the game is linear
he only spent little time on writing a backstory for phoenix before writing the first game 's story and instead made up dialogue and developed phoenix 's personality as he went along
he came up with the partner character maya because he thought it would be more fun for players to have another character with them giving them advice than investigating on their own
after the first game 's development was finished mikami told takumi that they should make an ace attorney trilogy with a grand finale in the third game 's last case
takumi had originally planned to let edgeworth be the prosecutor in all episodes in the second game but during the production the development team learned that the character had become popular
this led to takumi feeling that he had to use the character more carefully and sparingly he created the new prosecutor character franziska von karma to save edgeworth for the game 's last case and avoid a situation where he – a supposed prodigy – loses every case
as takumi wanted the three first ace attorney games to be parts of a larger work he avoided making a lot of changes between games art from the first game for main characters such as phoenix maya and edgeworth was reused to avoid having the previous games look outdated in comparison to newer games in the series and no new gameplay mechanics were added for trials and tribulations as takumi was happy with the gameplay after having added the psyche @-@ lock mechanic for justice for all
for the fourth game takumi wrote the scenario and took on a supervisory role
he had wanted the series to end with the third game as he felt phoenix had been fully explored and that his story had been told he said that it is important to know when to end a story that he did not want the series to become a shadow of its former self and that he did not see any reason to continue it
despite this the spin @-@ off series ace attorney investigations was created being directed by takeshi yamazaki and produced by motohide eshiro takumi returned to the series to write the crossover professor layton vs
phoenix wright ace attorney
he also directed and wrote dai gyakuten saiban which was described as being the first entry in a new ace attorney series
he said that he has mixed feelings about the series being developed by other capcom staff comparing it to a parent sending their child to their first day in school
yamazaki and eshiro went on to direct and produce the main series entries dual destinies and spirit of justice
due to exhaustion after working on dual destinies yamazaki split direction responsibilities with takuro fuse for spirit of justice with yamazaki working on the scenario and fuse on the art and gameplay
smith and the editor steve anderson
while the japanese version takes place in japan the localized version is set in the united states because one of the episodes involves time zones they had to specify where the game takes place and chose the united states without thinking a lot about it
the japanese justice system of the original still remained intact in the localization as changing it would have altered the entire game structure
the change in the series setting became an issue in later games where the japanese setting was more apparent
starting with the second game the series localization direction has been handled by janet hsu one of the first decisions she had to make was how to localize maya 's hometown and the mysticism of the fey clan
she came up with the idea that the localized versions of the ace attorney games take place in los angeles in an alternative universe where anti @-@ japanese laws like the california alien land law of <year> were not passed anti @-@ japanese sentiments were not powerful and where japanese culture flourished
this dictated what should be localized and what should be kept japanese things relating to the fey clan and the kurain channeling technique were kept japanese as that was maya 's heritage while japanese foods that were not widely known in the west were changed
character names were also localized to use double meanings similarly to the japanese names the name puns were based on the characters personalities or backgrounds or were visual gags
several english names were based on their japanese counterparts but for some characters the names had to be altered heavily compared to the japanese versions
smith and anderson had a lot of freedom when localizing the names of minor characters in the first game but discussed the names of the main cast with capcom
phoenix 's english surname wright was chosen as his japanese name naruhodō – meaning i see or i understand – was frequently used as a joke in the script
dual destinies was given a digital @-@ only release in the west
this was partially because of the game 's tight development schedule by releasing it digitally capcom was able to release the english version close to the japanese release date
two of the games have not been localized ace attorney investigations <num> and dai gyakuten saiban although the former has received a full fan translation
<num> million units sold worldwide
by december <year> the series had sold over <num> million units
in the united states the first game became surprisingly successful forcing capcom to prepare at least three additional runs to meet the demand
reviewers have liked finding contradictions a common complaint however is the games linearity as well as how the player sometimes has to resort to a trial @-@ and @-@ error method due to the games only accepting specific pieces of evidence and how testimony statements sometimes need to be pressed in a specific order
some reviewers have criticized the lack of changes to the gameplay and presentation throughout the series while some have said that fans of the series would not have a problem with this
geoff thew at hardcore gamer said that the craziness of the game world makes the cases entertaining but also that it resonates on a deeper level due to its connection to the real japanese legal system making the setting still feel relevant in <year>
bob mackey at usgamer said that the ace attorney games were among the best written games of all time and that the series strength is how each game builds up to a stunning and satisfying finale
thomas whitehead at nintendo life also liked the writing praising its balance between light @-@ hearted nonsense and darker more serious scenarios
several reviewers have appreciated the series characters thew said that phoenix and maya 's banter is among the best in video games and that edgeworth 's character arc is one of the most compelling parts of the stories
several reviewers have praised the series music
thew said that the greatest aspect of the series is its audio design with the first three games using the game boy advance sound chip better than any other game for that platform he called the music phenomenal with the exception of that in justice for all but said the sound effects are what steals the show
mackey commented that the games small amounts of animations for each character are used well for their characterization

these invasions were a result of the policy of president richard nixon
a total of <num> major operations were conducted by the army of the republic of vietnam arvn between <num> april and <num> july and by us forces between <num> may and <num> june
the objective of the campaign was the defeat of the approximately <num> @,@ <num> troops of the people 's army of vietnam pavn and the national front for the liberation of south vietnam nlf also known as viet cong who were ensconced in the eastern border regions of cambodia
cambodia 's official neutrality and military weakness made its territory effectively a safe zone where vietnamese communist forces could establish bases for operations over the border
with the us shifting toward a policy of vietnamization and withdrawal the us sought to shore up the south vietnamese government 's security by eliminating the cross @-@ border threat
a change in the cambodian government allowed a window of opportunity for the destruction of the base areas in <year> when prince norodom sihanouk was deposed and replaced by pro @-@ us general lon nol
allied military operations failed to eliminate many communist troops or to capture their elusive headquarters known as the central office for south vietnam cosvn but the haul of captured material in cambodia prompted claims of success
these base areas were also utilized by the vietnamese communists to store weapons and other material that had been transported on a large scale into the region on the sihanouk trail
pavn forces had begun moving through cambodian territory as early as <year>
in <year> prince norodom sihanouk ruler of cambodia convinced of eventual communist victory in southeast asia and fearful for the future of his rule had concluded an agreement with the people 's republic of china which allowed the establishment of permanent communist bases on cambodian soil and the use of the cambodian port of sihanoukville for resupply
during <year> cambodia 's indigenous communist movement labeled khmer rouge red khmers by sihanouk began an insurgency to overthrow the government
while they received very limited material help from the north vietnamese at the time the hanoi government had no incentive to overthrow sihanouk since it was satisfied with his continued neutrality they were able to shelter their forces in areas controlled by pavn nlf troops
the us government was aware of these activities in cambodia but refrained from taking overt military action within cambodia in hopes of convincing the mercurial sihanouk to alter his position
to accomplish this president lyndon b
johnson authorized covert cross @-@ border reconnaissance operations conducted by the secret studies and observations group in order to gather intelligence on pavn nlf activities in the border regions project vesuvius
this intelligence data would then be presented to the prince in an effort to change his mind
abrams recommended to president richard m
nixon shortly after his inauguration that the cambodian base areas be attacked by aerial bombardment utilizing b @-@ <num> stratofortress bombers
the president initially refused but the breaking point came with the launching of pavn 's mini @-@ tet offensive of <year> within south vietnam
nixon angered at what he perceived as a violation of the agreement with hanoi after the cessation of the bombing of north vietnam authorized the covert air campaign
the first mission of operation menu was dispatched on <num> march and by the time it was completed <num> months later more than <num> @,@ <num> sorties had been flown and <num> @,@ <num> tons of ordnance had been dropped on eastern cambodia
while sihanouk was abroad in france for a rest cure in january <year> government @-@ sponsored anti @-@ vietnamese demonstrations were held throughout cambodia
continued unrest spurred prime minister defense minister lon nol to close the port of sihanoukville to communist supplies and to issue an ultimatum on <num> march to the north vietnamese to withdraw their forces from cambodia within <num> hours
the prince outraged that his modus vivendi with the communists had been disturbed immediately arranged for a trip to moscow and beijing in an attempt to gain their agreement to apply pressure on hanoi to restrain its forces in cambodia
on <num> march the cambodian national assembly deposed sihanouk and named lon nol as provisional head of state
this led sihanouk to immediately establish a government @-@ in @-@ exile in beijing and to ally himself with north vietnam the khmer rouge the nlf and the laotian pathet lao
in doing so sihanouk lent his name and popularity in the rural areas of cambodia to a movement over which he had little control
the north vietnamese response to the coup was swift
pavn began directly supplying large amounts of weapons and advisors to the khmer rouge and cambodia plunged into civil war
lon nol saw cambodia 's population of <num> @,@ <num> ethnic vietnamese as possible hostages to prevent pavn attacks and ordered their roundup and internment
cambodian soldiers and civilians then unleashed a reign of terror murdering thousands of vietnamese civilians
on <num> april for example <num> vietnamese men had been rounded up at the village of churi changwar tied together executed and their bodies dumped into the mekong river
they then floated downstream into south vietnam
cambodia 's actions were denounced by both the north and south vietnamese governments
even before the supply conduit through sihanoukville was shut down pavn had begun expanding its logistical system from southeastern laos the ho chi minh trail into northeastern cambodia
pavn also launched an offensive campaign x against the cambodian army quickly seizing large portions of the eastern and northeastern parts of the country isolating and besieging or overrunning a number of cambodian cities including kampong cham
communist forces then approached within <num> miles <num> km of the capital phnom penh spurring president nixon into action
on <num> march <year> the north vietnamese had taken matters into their own hands and launched an offensive against the cambodian army with documents uncovered from the soviet archives revealing that the offensive was launched at the explicit request of the khmer rouge following negotiations with nuon chea
a force of north vietnamese quickly overran large parts of eastern cambodia reaching to within <num> miles <num> km of phnom penh
after defeating those forces the north vietnamese turned the newly won territories over to the local insurgents
the khmer rouge also established liberated areas in the south and the southwestern parts of the country where they operated independently of the north vietnamese
s
response
with sihanouk gone conditions were ripe for strong measures against the base areas
he was also adamant that some action be taken to support the only government in cambodia in the last twenty @-@ five years that had the guts to take a pro @-@ western stand
the president then solicited proposals for actions from the joint chiefs of staff and macv who presented him with a series of options a naval quarantine of the cambodian coast the launching of south vietnamese and american airstrikes the expansion of hot pursuit across the border by arvn forces or a ground invasion by arvn u
s
forces or both
during a televised address on <num> april nixon announced the withdrawal of <num> @,@ <num> u
s
troops from south vietnam during the year
this planned withdrawal implied restrictions on any offensive u
s
action in cambodia
by the spring of <year> macv still maintained <num> @,@ <num> u
s
army and <num> @,@ <num> marine corps troops in south vietnam most of whom were concentrated in <num> infantry and tank battalions
many of them however were preparing to leave the country or expected to leave in the near future and would not be available for immediate combat operations
on <num> april nixon authorized the planning of a south vietnamese incursion into the parrot 's beak named for its perceived shape on a map believing that giving the south vietnamese an operation of their own would be a major boost to their morale as well as provide a practical demonstration of the success of vietnamization
on the following day secretary of state william p
rogers testified before the house appropriations subcommittee that the administration had no intentions
to escalate the war
we recognize that if we escalate and get involved in cambodia with our ground troops that our whole program vietnamization is defeated
south vietnamese forces had been rehearsing for just such an operation since late march
on <num> april an arvn ranger battalion had advanced into kandal province to destroy a communist base
four days later other south vietnamese troops drove <num> kilometers into cambodian territory
lon nol who had initially attempted to follow a neutralist policy of his own requested military aid and assistance from the u
s
government on <num> april
on that day south vietnamese forces then conducted the first of three brief cross @-@ border operations under the aegis of operation toan thang complete victory <num> sending armored cavalry units into regions of cambodia 's svay rieng province nicknamed the angel 's wing and the crow 's nest
on <num> april <num> @,@ <num> south vietnamese troops advanced into the parrot 's beak killing <num> pavn troops
on <num> april nixon authorized american air support for the south vietnamese operations
all of these incursions into cambodian territory were simply reconnaissance missions in preparation for a larger @-@ scale effort being planned by macv and its arvn counterparts subject to authorization by nixon
president nixon then authorized general abrams to begin planning for a u
s
operation in the fishhook region
a preliminary operational plan had actually been completed in march but was kept so tightly under wraps that when abrams handed over the task to general michael davison commander of the ii field force he was not informed about the previous planning and started a new one from scratch
seventy @-@ two hours later davison 's plan was submitted to the white house
national security advisor dr
henry kissinger asked one of his aides to review it on <num> april and the nsc staffer was appalled by its sloppiness
the main problems were the pressure of time and the desire of the u
s
president for secrecy
the cambodian monsoon whose heavy rains would hamper operations was only two months away
by the order of the president the state department did not notify the cambodian desk at the us embassy saigon the phnom penh embassy or lon nol of the planning
operational security was as tight as general abrams could make it
there was to be no prior u
s
logistical build @-@ up in the border regions which might serve as a signal to the communists
u
s
brigade commanders were informed only a week in advance of the offensive while battalion commanders got only two or three days notice
secretary of defense melvin r
laird and secretary rogers were both opposed to any such operation due to their belief that it would engender intense domestic opposition in the u
s
and that it might possibly derail the ongoing peace negotiations in paris they had both opposed the menu bombings for the same reasons
both were castigated by henry kissinger for their bureaucratic foot @-@ dragging
as a result laird was bypassed by the joint chiefs in advising the white house on planning and preparations for the cambodian operation
on the evening of <num> april nixon dined with his friend bebe rebozo and kissinger
afterward they screened one of nixon 's favorite movies patton a biographical portrayal of controversial general george s
patton jr
which he had seen five times previously
kissinger later commented that when he was pressed to the wall his nixon 's romantic streak surfaced and he would see himself as a beleaguered military commander in the tradition of patton
the following evening nixon decided that we would go for broke and gave his authorization for the incursion
the joint u
s
arvn campaign would begin on <num> may with the stated goals of reducing allied casualties in south vietnam assuring the continued withdrawal of u
s
forces and enhancing the u
s
saigon government position at the peace negotiations in paris
in order to keep the campaign as low @-@ key as possible general abrams had suggested that the commencement of the incursion be routinely announced from saigon
at <num> <num> on <num> april however president nixon appeared on all three u
s
television networks to announce that it is not our power but our will and character that is being tested tonight and that the time has come for action
he announced his decision to launch american forces into cambodia with the special objective of capturing cosvn the headquarters of the entire communist military operation in south vietnam
cosvn as a single headquarters for control of pavn operations in south vietnam probably did not exist or at least was never found
moving across the border in cambodia on <num> march elements of the prg and nlf were surrounded in their bunkers by south vietnamese forces flown in by helicopter
surrounded they awaited till nightfall and then with security provided by the nlf <num> division they broke out of the encirclement and fled north to unite with the cosvn in the cambodian kratie province in what would come to be known as escape of the provisional revolutionary government
trương như tảng was the minister of justice in the prg and he recounts that during the march to the northern bases was day after day of forced marches broken up by b @-@ <num> bombing raids
just before the column crossed route <num> on their way north they received word that on <num> april the <num> division had fought and won a battle near the city of krek cambodia against arvn forces
years later trương would recall just how close south vietnamese were to annihilating or capturing the core of the southern resistance – elite units of our frontline fighters along with the civilian and much of the military leadership
after many days of hard marches the prg reached the northern bases and relative safety in the kratie region
casualties were light and the march even saw the birth of a baby to dương quỳnh hoa the deputy minister of health in the provisional revolutionary government prg
the column needed many days to recover and trương himself would require weeks to recover from the long march
<num> arvn battalions of approximately <num> @,@ <num> troops two armored cavalry squadrons from iii corps and two from the <num> division and <num> infantry divisions an infantry regiment from the <num> infantry division and three ranger battalions and an attached arvn armored cavalry regt from the <num> ranger group crossed into the parrot 's beak region of svay rieng province
the offensive was under the command of lieutenant general đỗ cao trí the commander of iii corps who had a reputation as one of the most aggressive and competent arvn generals
during their first two days in cambodia arvn units had several sharp encounters with pavn forces
the north vietnamese forewarned by previous arvn incursions however conducted only delaying actions in order to allow the bulk of their forces to escape to the west
the arvn operation soon settled down to become a search and destroy mission with south vietnamese troops combing the countryside in small patrols looking for pavn supply caches
phase ii of the operation began with the arrival of elements of the <num> infantry division
four tank @-@ infantry task forces attacked into the parrot 's beak from the south
after three days of operations arvn claimed <num> @,@ <num> pavn troops had been killed and <num> prisoners taken for the loss of <num> arvn dead and <num> wounded
on <num> may an even larger operation known by the arvn as operation toan thang <num> and by macv as operation rockcrusher got underway as <num> b @-@ <num> dropped <num> tons of bombs along the southern edge of the fishhook
this was followed by an hour of massed artillery fire and another hour of strikes by tactical fighter @-@ bombers
at <num> <num> the 1st air cav division the <num> armored cavalry regiment the 1st arvn armoured cavalry regiment and the <num> arvn airborne brigade then entered kampong cham province of cambodia
known as task force shoemaker after general robert m
shoemaker the assistant division commander of the 1st cavalry division the force attacked the long @-@ time communist stronghold with <num> @,@ <num> u
s
and <num> @,@ <num> south vietnamese troops
the operation utilized mechanized infantry and armored units to drive deep into the province where they would then link up with arvn airborne and u
s
airmobile units that had been lifted in by helicopter
opposition to the incursion was expected to be heavy but pavn nlf forces had begun moving westward two days before the advance began
by <num> may macv reported only eight americans killed and <num> wounded low casualties for such a large operation
there was only scattered and sporadic contact with delaying forces such as that experienced by elements of the u
s
<num> armoured cavalry three kilometers inside cambodia
pavn troops opened fire with small arms and rockets only to be blasted by tank fire and tactical airstrikes
when the smoke had cleared <num> dead pavn soldiers were counted on the battlefield while only two u
s
troops were killed during the action
1st battalion <num> cavalry <num> brigade 1st cavalry division was in the fishhook very early may through <num> june when they crossed the river back into vietnam
there was extremely heavy combat throughout the period
american losses were very heavy with all units relying on heavy inflow of replacements to try to maintain at least half strength in the field
in one company of all the men who had entered cambodia only nine left on <num> june the rest having been either killed or wounded and evacuated
the unit was awarded the valorous unit award equivalent to individual silver stars for their combat performance in the fishhook
the north vietnamese had ample notice of the impending attack
a <num> march directive from the headquarters of the b @-@ <num> front captured during the incursion ordered pavn nlf forces to break away and avoid shooting back
our purpose is to conserve forces as much as we can
the only surprised party amongst the participants in the incursion seemed to be lon nol who had been informed by neither washington nor saigon concerning the impending invasion of his country
he only discovered the fact after a telephone conversation with the head of the u
s
mission who had found out about it himself from a radio broadcast
the only conventional battle fought by american troops occurred on <num> may at the town of snoul the suspected terminus of the sihanouk trail at the junction of routes <num> <num> and <num>
elements of the u
s
<num> armored cavalry and supporting helicopters came under pavn fire while approaching the town and its airfield
when a massed american attack was met by heavy resistance the americans backed off called in air support and blasted the town for two days reducing it to rubble
during the action brigadier general donn a
starry commander of the <num> armored cavalry was wounded by grenade fragments and evacuated
s
1st air cavalry division entered what came to be known as the city southwest of snoul
the two @-@ square mile pavn complex contained over <num> thatched huts storage sheds and bunkers each of which was packed with food weapons and ammunition
there were truck repair facilities hospitals a lumber yard <num> mess halls a pig farm and even a swimming pool
forty kilometers to the northeast other 1st cavalry division elements discovered a larger base on <num> may
nicknamed rock island east after the u
s
army 's rock island arsenal in illinois the area contained more than <num>
<num> million rounds of anti @-@ aircraft ammunition <num> @,@ <num> rifle rounds thousands of rockets several general motors trucks and large quantities of communications equipment
while on patrol <num> kilometers northeast of rock island east on <num> may a point man nicknamed shakey chris keffalos from the <num> battalion <num> cavalry tripped over a metal plate buried just below the surface of the ground
the trooper was later killed by pavn defenders but the cache he had uncovered was the first of <num> buried storage bunkers at the site of what was thereafter known as shakey 's hill
the bunkers contained thousands of cases of weapons and ammunition all of which were turned over to the cambodian army
much of the captured enemy material was turned over to the macv special support group for cambodia where it was maintained and then issued to lon nol 's forces
this group was commanded by lieutenant colonel will h
horn
the one thing that was not found was cosvn
on <num> may a tape of nixon 's announcement of the incursion was played for general abrams who must have cringed when he heard the president state that the capture of the headquarters was one of the major objectives of the operation
macv intelligence knew that the mobile and widely- dispersed headquarters would be difficult to locate
in response to a white house query before the fact macv had replied that major cosvn elements are dispersed over approximately <num> square kilometers of jungle and that the feasibility of capturing major elements appears remote
after the first week of operations additional battalion and brigade units were committed to the operation so that between <num> and <num> may a total of <num> @,@ <num> allied troops including <num> u
s
maneuver battalions were conducting operations inside cambodia
due to increasing political and domestic turbulence in the u
s
president nixon issued a directive on <num> may limiting the distance and duration of u
s
operations to a depth of <num> kilometers <num> mi and setting a deadline of <num> june for the withdrawal of all u
s
forces to south vietnam
south vietnamese forces were not constrained by the time and geographic limitations placed upon u
s
units
from the provincial capital of svay rieng arvn elements pressed westward to kampong trabek where on <num> may their <num> and <num> armored cavalry regiments defeated the <num> pavn infantry regiment
on <num> may the south vietnamese pushed beyond the deepest u
s
penetrations and attacked the town of krek
s
<num> infantry division and the <num> arvn infantry regiment against base area <num> the traditional headquarters of the communist b @-@ <num> front in northeastern cambodia from <num> – <num> may
following airstrikes the initial american forces assaulting via helicopter were driven back by intense anti @-@ aircraft fire
on the following day the <num> battalion <num> infantry on loan from the u
s
101st airborne division landed without opposition
its sister unit the 1st battalion <num> infantry was also unopposed
the <num> battalion of the <num> infantry however inserted only <num> men before intense pavn fire which shot down one helicopter and damaged two others shut down the landing zone leaving them stranded and surrounded overnight
by the following morning pavn forces had left the area
on the <num> the division 's <num> brigade inserted its three battalions unopposed
after ten days and only one significant firefight the american troops returned to south vietnam leaving the area to the arvn
historian shelby stanton has noted that there was a noted lack of aggressiveness in the combat assault and that the division seemed to be suffering from almost total combat paralysis
during operation binh tay ii the arvn <num> division moved against base area <num> from <num> – <num> may
the second phase of the operation was carried out by arvn forces against base area <num> between <num> may and <num> june when elements of the arvn <num> division conducted operations against base area <num>
on <num> may bravo company <num> battalion <num> regiment 101st airborne division was ambushed by a much larger north vietnamese force in the se san valley
eight u
s
soldiers were killed and <num> wounded
among the killed was spc
leslie sabo jr
posthumously promoted to sergeant who was recommended for the medal of honor but the paperwork went missing until <year>
sabo was awarded the medal of honor on <num> may <year> by president barack obama
in the iii corps tactical zone operation toan thang <num> operation bold lancer was conducted by the 1st and <num> brigades of the u
s
<num> infantry division between <num> may and <num> june
the targets of the operation were base areas <num> <num> and <num> located north and northeast of tay ninh south vietnam
once again a hunt for cosvn units was conducted this time around the cambodian town of memot and once again the search was futile
during its operations the <num> infantry killed <num> @,@ <num> pavn and nlf troops while losing <num> of its own men killed
simultaneous with the launching of toan thang <num> the two battalions of the <num> brigade u
s
<num> infantry division crossed the border <num> kilometers southwest of the fishhook into an area known as the dog 's face from <num> through <num> may
the only significant contact with pavn forces took place near the hamlet of chantrea where <num> north vietnamese were killed and another <num> were captured
during the operation the brigade lost eight men killed and <num> wounded
it was already too late for thousands of ethnic vietnamese murdered by cambodian persecution but there were tens of thousands of vietnamese still within the country who could now be evacuated to safety
south vietnamese president nguyễn văn thiệu arranged with lon nol to repatriate as many as were willing to leave
the new relationship did not however prevent the cambodian government from stripping the vietnamese of their homes and other personal property before they left
thieu then authorized operation cuu long in which arvn ground forces including mechanized and armoured units drove west and northwest up the eastern side of the mekong river from <num> may – <num> july
a combined force of <num> vietnamese navy and <num> u
s
vessels proceeded up the mekong to prey veng permitting iv corps ground forces to move westward to phnom penh and to aid ethnic vietnamese seeking flight to south vietnam
those who did not wish to be repatriated were then forcibly expelled
surprisingly north vietnamese forces did not oppose the evacuation though they could easily have done so
other operations conducted from iv corps included operation cuu long ii <num> – <num> may which continued actions along the western side of the mekong
lon nol had requested that the arvn help in the retaking of kompong speu a town along route <num> southwest of phnom penh and <num> miles <num> km inside cambodia
a <num> @,@ <num> @-@ man arvn armoured task force linked up with cambodian ground troops and then retook the town
operation cuu long iii <num> may – <num> june was an evolution of the previous operations after u
s
forces had left cambodia
after rescuing the vietnamese from the cambodians arvn was tasked with saving the cambodians from the north vietnamese
the goal was to relieve the city of kompong cham <num> kilometers northwest of the capital and the site of the headquarters of cambodia 's military region i
on <num> may general tri led a column of <num> @,@ <num> arvn troops along route <num> to the <num> @-@ acre <num>
<num> km2 chup rubber plantation where pavn resistance was expected to be heavy
surprisingly no battle ensued and the siege of kompong cham was lifted at a cost of <num> pavn troops killed
reconnaissance flights over the operational area were restricted since macv believed that they might serve as a signal of intention
the role of the air force in the planning for the incursion itself was minimal at best in part to preserve the secrecy of menu which was then considered an overture to the thrust across the border
on <num> april general abrams requested that the president approve operation patio covert tactical airstrikes in support of studies and observations group recon elements across the fence in cambodia
this authorization was given allowing u
s
aircraft to penetrate <num> miles <num> km into northeastern cambodia
this boundary was extended to <num> miles <num> km along the entire frontier on <num> april
patio was terminated on <num> may after <num> sorties had been flown
the last menu mission was flown on <num> may
during the incursion itself u
s
and arvn ground units were supported by <num> @,@ <num> aerial sorties <num> @,@ <num> u
s
<num> @,@ <num> vietnamese air force an average of <num> per day
during operations in the fishhook for example the usaf flew <num> @,@ <num> sorties and the south vietnamese air force <num>
these tactical airstrikes were supplemented by <num> b @-@ <num> missions in the border regions <num> supporting binh tay operations <num> for toan thang operations and <num> for cuu long
<num> may saw the inauguration of operation freedom deal named as of <num> june a continuous u
s
aerial interdiction campaign conducted in cambodia
these missions were limited to a depth of <num> @-@ kilometers between the south vietnamese border and the mekong river
within two months however the limit of the operational area was extended past the mekong and u
s
tactical aircraft were soon directly supporting cambodian forces in the field
these missions were officially denied by the u
s
and false coordinates were given in official reports to hide their existence
defense department records indicated that out of more than <num> @,@ <num> combat sorties flown in cambodia between july <year> and february <year> approximately <num> percent were flown outside the authorized freedom deal boundary
the real struggle for the u
s
and arvn forces in cambodia was the effort at keeping their units supplied
once again the need for security before the operations and the rapidity with which units were transferred to the border regions precluded detailed planning and preparation
this situation was exacerbated by the poor road network in the border regions and the possibility of ambush for nighttime road convoys demanded that deliveries only take place during daylight
aerial resupply therefore became the chief method of logistical replenishment for the forward units
military engineers and aviators were kept in constant motion throughout the incursion zone
due to the rapid pace of operations deployment and redeployment coordination of artillery units and their fires became a worrisome quandary during the operations
this was made even more problematic by the confusion generated by the lack of adequate communications systems between the rapidly advancing units
the joint nature of the operation added another level of complexity to the already overstretched communications network
regardless due to the ability of u
s
logisticians to innovate and improvise supplies of food water ammunition and spare parts arrived at their destinations without any shortages hampering combat operations and the communications system although complicated functioned well enough during the short duration of u
s
operations
pavn forces were well aware of the planned attack and many cosvn b @-@ <num> front military units were already far to the north and west conducting operations against the cambodians when the offensive began
during <year> pavn logistical units had already begun the largest expansion of the ho chi minh trail conducted during the entire conflict
as a response to the loss of their cambodian supply route north vietnamese forces seized the laotian towns of attopeu and saravane during the year pushing what had been a <num> @-@ mile <num> km corridor to a width of <num> miles <num> km and opening the entire length of the kong river system into cambodia
a new logistical command the <num> transportation group was created to handle logistics in cambodia and the new liberation route ran through siem prang and reached the mekong at stung treng
as foreseen by secretary laird fallout from the incursion was quick in coming on the campuses of america 's universities as protests erupted against what was perceived as an expansion of the conflict into yet another country
on <num> may the unrest escalated to violence when ohio national guardsmen shot and killed four unarmed students two of whom were not protesters during the kent state shootings
two days later at the university at buffalo police wounded four more demonstrators
on <num> may <num> @,@ <num> protesters gathered in washington and another <num> @,@ <num> in san francisco on only ten days notice
nationwide <num> rotc buildings went up in flames or were bombed while <num> schools witnessed violent clashes between students and police
national guard units were mobilized on <num> campuses in <num> states
the student strike spread nationwide involving more than four million students and <num> universities colleges and high schools in mostly peaceful protests and walkouts
simultaneously public opinion polls during the second week of may showed that <num> percent of the american public approved of president nixon 's actions
fifty @-@ eight percent blamed the students for what had occurred at kent state
on both sides emotions ran high
in one instance in new york city on <num> may pro @-@ administration construction workers rioted and attacked demonstrating students
such violence however was an aberration
most demonstrations both pro- and anti @-@ war were peaceful
on <num> may <num> @,@ <num> construction workers tradesmen and office workers marched peacefully through new york city in support of the president 's policies
reaction in the u
s
congress to the incursion was also swift
senators frank f
church democratic party idaho and john s
cooper republican party kentucky proposed an amendment to the foreign military sales act that would have cut off funding not only for u
s
ground operations and advisors in cambodia but would also have ended u
s
air support for cambodian forces
on <num> june the united states senate passed the act with the amendment included
the bill was defeated in the house of representatives after u
s
forces were withdrawn from cambodia as scheduled
the newly amended act did however rescind the southeast asia resolution better known as the gulf of tonkin resolution under which presidents johnson and nixon had conducted military operations for seven years without a declaration of war
the cooper – church amendment was resurrected during the winter and incorporated into the supplementary foreign assistance act of <year>
this time the measure made it through both houses of congress and became law on <num> december
as a result all u
s
ground troops and advisors were barred from participating in military actions in laos or cambodia while the air war being conducted in both countries by the u
s
air force was ignored
general abrams was of like mind believing that time had been bought for the pacification of the south vietnamese countryside and that u
s
and arvn forces had been made safe from any attack out of cambodia during <year> and <year>
a decent interval had been obtained for the final american withdrawal
arvn general tran dinh tho was more skeptical despite its spectacular results
it must be recognized that the cambodian incursion proved in the long run to pose little more than a temporary disruption of north vietnam 's march toward domination of all of laos cambodia and south vietnam
john shaw and other historians military and civilian have based the conclusions of their work on the incursion on the premise that the north vietnamese logistical system in cambodia had been so badly damaged that it was rendered ineffective
the next large @-@ scale north vietnamese offensive the nguyen hue offensive of <year> called the easter offensive in the west would be launched out of southern north vietnam and western laos not from cambodia was cited as proof positive that the cambodian operations had succeeded
the fact that pavn forces were otherwise occupied in cambodia and had no such offensive plan so far as is known was seemingly irrelevant
the fact that logistically a northern offensive especially a conventional one backed by armour and heavy artillery would be launched closer to its source of manpower and supply also seemed to be of little consequence
the logistical haul discovered removed or destroyed in eastern cambodia during the operations was indeed prodigious <num> @,@ <num> individual and <num> @,@ <num> crew @-@ served weapons <num> @,@ <num> to <num> @,@ <num> tons of rice <num> @,@ <num> tons of ammunition including <num> @,@ <num> mortar shells rockets and recoilless rifle rounds <num> tons of communications equipment <num> vehicles and <num> tons of medical supplies
macv intelligence estimated that pavn nlf forces in southern vietnam required <num> @,@ <num> tons of all supplies each month to keep up a normal pace of operations
due to the loss of its cambodian supply system and continued aerial interdiction in laos macv estimated that for every <num>
<num> tons of materiel sent south down the ho chi minh trail only one ton reached its destination
however the true loss rate was probably only around ten percent
general abrams claimed <num> @,@ <num> enemy soldiers killed and <num> @,@ <num> captured but his figures were disputed by cia who insisted that civilians death were figured into abrams 's total south vietnamese forces had performed well during the incursion but their leadership was uneven
general tri proved a resourceful and inspiring commander earning the sobriquet the patton of the parrot 's beak from the american media
general abrams also praised the skill of general nguyen viet thanh commander of iv corps and planner of the parrot 's beak operation
unfortunately for the anti @-@ communists both officers were killed in helicopter crashes — thanh on <num> may in cambodia and tri in february <year>
other arvn commanders however had not performed well
even at this late date in the conflict the appointment of arvn general officers was prompted by political loyalty rather than professional competence
as a test of vietnamization the incursion was praised by american generals and politicians alike but the vietnamese had not really performed alone
the participation of u
s
ground and air forces had precluded any such claim
when called on to conduct solo offensive operations during the incursion into laos operation lam son <num> in <year> the arvn 's continued weaknesses would become all too apparent
the cambodian government was not informed of the incursion until it was already under way
it has been argued by some scholars that the incursion heated up the civil war and helped the insurgent khmer rouge gather recruits to their cause

commonly known as the early morel or early false morel or the wrinkled thimble @-@ cap it is one of several species known informally as a false morel
the mushroom has a pale yellow or brown thimble @-@ shaped cap — <num> to <num> cm <num>
<num> to <num>
<num> in in diameter by <num> to <num> cm <num>
<num> to <num>
<num> in long — that has a surface wrinkled and ribbed with brain @-@ like convolutions
the cap hangs from the top of a lighter @-@ colored brittle stem that measures up to <num> cm <num>
<num> in long by <num> to <num>
<num> cm <num>
<num> to <num>
<num> in thick
microscopically the mushroom is distinguished by its large spores typically <num> – <num> by <num> – <num> µm and the presence of only two spores per ascus
in the field the mushroom is reliably distinguished from the true morels on the basis of cap attachment v
bohemica has a cap that hangs completely free from the stem
although widely considered edible consumption of the mushroom is generally not advised due to reports of poisoning in susceptible individuals
poisoning symptoms include gastrointestinal upset and lack of muscular coordination
v
bohemica is found in northern north america europe and asia
it fruits in early spring growing on the ground in woods following the snowmelt before the appearance of true morels genus morchella
the synonym ptychoverpa bohemica is often used by european mycologists
the german naturalist joseph schröter transferred it to the genus verpa in <year>
ptychoverpa bohemica is a synonym that was published by frenchman jean louis émile boudier in his <year> treatise on the discomycetes of europe the name is still occasionally used especially in european publications
boudier believed that the large curved ascospores and the rare and short paraphyses were sufficiently distinct to warrant a new genus to contain the single species
ptychoverpa has also been classified as a section of verpa
the section is characterized by the presence of thick longitudinal ridges on the cap that can be simple or forked
the specific epithet bohemica refers to bohemia now a part of the czech republic where krombholz originally collected the species
the mushroom is commonly known as the early morel early false morel or the wrinkled thimble @-@ cap
ptychoverpa is derived from the ancient greek ptyx genitive form ptychos meaning fold layer or plate
<num> to <num>
<num> in in diameter by <num> to <num> cm <num>
<num> to <num>
<num> in long with a conical or bell shape
it is folded into longitudinal ridges that often fuse together anastomose in a vein @-@ like network
the cap is attached to the stem at the top only — hanging from the top of the stipe with the lobed edge free from the stem — and varies in color from yellowish @-@ brown to reddish @-@ brown the underside of the cap is pale
the stem is <num> to <num> cm <num>
<num> to <num>
<num> in long by <num> to <num>
<num> cm <num>
<num> to <num>
<num> in thick cream @-@ white in color and tapers upward so that the stem is thicker at the base than at the top
although the stem is initially loosely stuffed with cottony hyphae it eventually becomes hollow in maturity overall the mushroom is rather fragile
the spore deposit is yellow and the flesh is white
relative to other typical mushroom species the spores of v
bohemica are huge typically measuring <num> – <num> by <num> – <num> µm
they are elliptical smooth sometimes curved and appear hyaline translucent to yellowish
the spores which number two more rarely three per ascus are characteristic for this species
the smooth elliptical asci measure <num> – <num> µm long by <num> – <num> µm wide
the british @-@ canadian mycologist arthur henry reginald buller determined that the asci are heliotropic — they bend toward light
as he noted i cut transverse sections though their pilei examined these sections under the microscope and at once perceived that in all the hymenial grooves and depressions the asci were curved outwards so that their opercula must have faced the strongest rays of light to which the ends of the asci has been subjected in the places where the fruit @-@ bodies developed
this response to the stimulus of light is significant because it permits a fruit body to point and later discharge its asci towards open spaces thus increasing the chances that the spores will be dispersed by wind
the paraphyses are thick and club @-@ shaped with diameters of <num> – <num> µm at their tips
symptoms include gastrointestinal upset and lack of muscular coordination similar to the effects reported by some individuals after consuming the false morel species gyromitra esculenta
the responsible toxin in g
esculenta is gyromitrin it is suspected that v
bohemica may be able to synthesize low levels of the toxin
over @-@ consumption of the mushroom has been reported to have induced a coma
those who do wish to eat this species are often advised to parboil with copious quantities of water discarding the water before consumption to dry the specimens before eating or if eating for the first time to restrict consumption to small portions to test their tolerance
some advocate only eating the caps and discarding the stems
opinions on the flavor of the mushrooms vary ranging from strong but not on a par with true morels to pleasant to not distinctive
v
conica may be distinguished microscopically by its eight @-@ spored asci
its north american range extends much further south than v
bohemica
another similar group of species are the half @-@ free morels morchella semilibera and others which have a honeycombed cap that is attached to the stalk for about half of its length and with ridges that are darker than the pits
additionally a cross @-@ sectioned stem of a specimen of m
semilibera is hollow while v
bohemica usually has cottony wisps in the stem and m
semilibera usually has vertical perforations near the base while v
bohemica lacks them
verpa bohemica may be reliably distinguished from all similar species by its much larger spores
bohemica grow singly or scattered on the ground in woods in early spring often before the appearance of the morel and throughout the morel season
it is often found along riverbanks near cottonwoods willows and aspens often buried in plant litter
the fungus prefers to fruit in moist areas with ample sunlight
its minimum growth temperature is <num> ° c <num> ° f with an optimum of <num> ° c <num> ° f and a maximum of about <num> ° c <num> ° f
a study of carbon and nitrogen isotope ratios indicated that verpa bohemica is saprobic that is obtaining nutrients from decomposing organic matter
it has been suggested however that the fungus is mycorrhizal for at least part of its life cycle
the fungus has a wide distribution throughout northern north america its range extends south to the great lakes in the midwestern united states and south to northern california on the west coast
in europe the fungus is widely distributed and has been collected from austria the czech republic denmark finland germany norway poland russia slovenia spain sweden and the ukraine
in asia it has been recorded from india and turkey
a <num> @-@ year study of the distribution time of fruiting and habitats of morel and false morel population in iowa showed that early false morels are the first morels to fruit in the spring appearing shortly after leaves begin to form on deciduous trees
narrow @-@ head morels morchella angusticeps fruit next followed by the yellow or white morels morchella esculenta then lastly morchella crassipes
the fruit bodies serve as a habitat for breeding dipterans flies including porricondyla media pegomya geniculata and trichocera annulata

studies of wastewater from varanasi 's sewage treatment plants identify that water 's contamination with metals and the reuse of this water for irrigation as a way that the toxic metals come to be in the plants that people grow for food
one studied example is palak a popular leafy vegetable which takes up heavy metal when it is in the soil and which people then eat
some of the polluting sludge contains minerals which are fertiliser which could make polluted water attractive to use
pesticides used in local farming are persistent enough to be spread through the water to sewer treatment then back to the farms as wastewater

the original building was constructed in <year> as part of a worldwide research project run by edward sabine to determine the cause of fluctuations in magnetic declination
measurements from the toronto site demonstrated that sunspots were responsible for this effect on earth 's magnetic field
when this project concluded in <year> the observatory was greatly expanded by the canadian government and served as the country 's primary meteorological station and official timekeeper for over fifty years
the observatory is considered the birthplace of canadian astronomy
the astronomer edmund halley noted this and the problems it would cause for navigation in <year>
it was also believed that whatever was causing this effect might be causing changes in the weather and that studying magnetic variations might lead to better weather prediction
in <year> the british association for the advancement of science commissioned a series of magnetic measurements across the united kingdom
under the direction of major edward sabine of the royal artillery a multi @-@ year measuring project began with the results to be published in <year>
as the measurements were being made a number of proposals were put forth to expand the program worldwide
in <year> the german explorer and naturalist alexander von humboldt wrote to prince augustus frederick duke of sussex then president of the royal society stating that a formal program was important to a nation with dominions spread across the globe
at the seventh meeting of the british association in liverpool in <year> sabine declared that the magnetism of the earth cannot be counted less than one of the most important branches of the physical history of the planet we inhabit and mapping its variations would be regarded by our contemporaries and by posterity as a fitting enterprise of a maritime people and a worthy achievement of a nation which has ever sought to rank foremost in every arduous undertaking
in <year> the british government funded the installation of a magnetic observatory at greenwich
the association continued to press for the construction of similar observatories around the world and in <year> their suggestions were accepted by the government and funds were provided
in <year> the british government and the royal society prepared four expeditions to build magnetic observation stations in cape town st
helena hobart tasmania and eventually toronto
teams of royal artillery officers were sent out to take the measurements
the team assigned to canada originally planned to build their observatory on saint helen 's island off montreal but the local rocks proved to have a high magnetic influence and the decision was made to move to toronto instead
the team arrived in <year> and set up camp at fort york in a disused barracks while construction started on new buildings
the observatory was given <num> acres <num>
<num> ha of land to the west of king 's college the ontario legislature now occupies the area on which the college was located
the observatory officially her majesty 's magnetical and meteorological observatory at toronto was completed the following year
it consisted of two log buildings one for the magnetic instruments and the other a smaller semi @-@ buried building nearby for experimental determinations
the north end of the main building was connected to a small conical dome which contained a theodolite used to make astronomical measurements for the accurate determination of the local time
the buildings were constructed with as little metal as possible when metal was required non @-@ magnetic materials such as brass or copper were used
a small barracks was built nearby to house the crew
using the measurements from the toronto and hobart sites sabine noticed both short @-@ term fluctuations in magnetic declination over a period of hours and longer @-@ term variations over months
he quickly concluded that the short term variations were due to the day night cycle while the longer term ones were due to the number of visible sunspots
he published two introductory papers on the topic in the philosophical transactions of the royal society
the first in <year> was a collection of early measurements the second in <year> correlated with heinrich schwabe 's sunspot measurements which had been made widely available in alexander von humboldt 's cosmos also published in <year>
with further data collected from the toronto site sabine was able to demonstrate conclusively that the eleven @-@ year sunspot cycle caused a similarly periodic variation in the earth 's magnetic field
he presented a third and conclusive paper on the topic in <year> on periodical laws discoverable in the mean effects of the larger magnetic disturbances in which he singled out the toronto site for particular praise
sir john henry lefroy a pioneer in the study of terrestrial magnetism served as director of the magnetic observatory from <year> to <year> in <year> the ontario heritage foundation ministry of citizenship and culture erected a provincial military plaque in his honour on the university of toronto campus
after a lengthy debate the fledgling colonial government decided to take over its operation
rather than disappearing like its three counterparts the toronto observatory was upgraded and its mission was expanded as it became a meteorological station see meteorological service of canada under the direction of the ministry of marine and fisheries
during the expansion the original buildings were replaced with a permanent structure
the new building was designed in <year> by local architect frederick cumberland who was also working on the design of university college which was being built just north of the observatory to replace king 's college
the new observatory design called for a stone building with an attached tower containing the theodolite
the new building was completed in <year> and stood directly opposite the entrance of today 's convocation hall
during its time as a meteorological station the observatory collected reports from <num> observation stations in canada and another <num> in the united states
each station was equipped with a mercurial barometer two thermometers a maximum and a minimum thermometer an anemometer to measure the velocity of the wind a wind vane and a rain gauge
reports were sent in coded form to the observatory at <num> am and <num> pm every day eastern standard time then known as <num> meridian time and used to produce a chart predicting the weather for the following <num> hours
these predictions were then telegraphed across the country and charts were distributed to newspapers and the board of trade where they could be viewed by the public
with the installation of telephones the observatory also offered weather reports on demand which was an important service to fruit vendors who used the reports to plan shipping
among its other uses in <year> measurements from the site were used as part of the effort to develop standard time
the observatory remained the official timekeeper for canada until <year> when that responsibility was transferred to ottawa 's dominion observatory
at exactly <num> <num> am the clocks in toronto fire halls were rung by an electrical signal from the observatory
in <year> the observatory 's director charles carpmeal suggested adding a high @-@ quality telescope to the observatory
he felt that direct solar observations would lead to a better understanding of sunspot effects on weather as late as <year> the observatory 's then @-@ director r
f
stupart noted that sun spots have more to do with our weather conditions than have the rings around the moon

coincidentally the canadian government having formed in <year> was interested in taking part in the major international effort to accurately record the december <year> transit of venus
funds were provided for the purchase of a <num> @-@ inch <num> mm refracting telescope from t
cooke sons
the dome was originally designed to mount a small transit and the lengthy telescope over <num> metres long had a limited field of view though the dome 's opening
a large stone pillar was constructed inside the tower raising the telescope to bring it closer to the dome and improve its field of view
unfortunately the new telescope was unable to take part in the transit measurements due to bad weather and missed the <year> transit of mercury for the same reason
electrification of the tramways along college street just to the south and the large quantities of metal used in the modern buildings surrounding the site threw off the instruments
a new magnetic observatory opened in <year> in agincourt at that time largely empty fields <num> leaving the downtown campus location with its meteorological and solar observation duties
by <year> new university buildings completely surrounded the observatory dust from the construction clogged meteorological instruments and at night electric lighting made astronomical work impossible
the meteorological office decided to abandon the site and move to a new building at the north end of campus on bloor street trading the original observatory to the university in exchange for the new parcel of land
there was some discussion regarding what to do with the cooke telescope since the meteorological office had little use for this purely astronomical instrument
no other use was immediately forthcoming and the telescope moved along with the meteorological office to their new bloor street observatory
the university assumed ownership of the now @-@ disused observatory building and was originally going to abandon it
louis beaufort stewart a lecturer in the faculty of applied science and engineering campaigned for it to be saved for the department of surveying and geodesy
he eventually arranged for the building to be re @-@ constructed on a more suitable site
demolition work was carried out in <year> the stones were simply left in place over the winter and were used the following year to construct a re @-@ arranged building just east of the main university college building south of hart house
in <year> the meteorological office no longer used the cooke telescope and agreed to donate it to the university if they would handle its removal
both the telescope and the observatory dome were moved to the observatory building
the telescope moved once again in <year> to the david dunlap observatory north of the city and in <year> it was donated to the canada science and technology museum
the department of surveying and geodesy used the observatory until the <num>
since then the office areas have been used for a variety of purposes including a police substation and a telephone switchboard
renamed as the louis beaufort stewart observatory the building was handed over to the students administrative council now university of toronto students union in <year> which has used the building since then
the dome now unused receives a yearly multi @-@ colour paint job by engineering students
the season produced <num> tropical and subtropical cyclones of which only <num> reached storm intensity <num> became hurricanes and only <num> reached major hurricane status
although more active than the <year> season <year> brought few storms of note
nearly half of the season 's storms affected land one of which resulted in severe damage
the season officially began on june <num> <year> and lasted until november <num> <year>
these dates conventionally delimit the period of each year when most tropical cyclones form in the atlantic basin
however the first system formed on april <num> more than a month before the official start
three more depressions formed before june <num> however none attained storm intensity
the first named storm of the year was hurricane alice which formed on july <num> and became the first known cyclone to affect bermuda during july
more than a month later the second hurricane brenda formed and was considered the worst storm to strike mexico along the eastern coast of the bay of campeche killing <num> people
later in august tropical storm christine became the easternmost forming tropical cyclone on record when it developed formed over guinea
the most intense storm of the season was hurricane ellen a category <num> cyclone that remained over open water
the final named storm was meteorologically significant in that it became the first recorded tropical cyclone to transition into a subtropical cyclone
no names were retired during the season however due to the addition of male names into the list of atlantic hurricane names in <year> several of the names were removed and have not been used since
several other short @-@ lived weak depressions formed before and during june however none reached storm intensity
the first named storm alice formed on july <num>
tracking generally to the north alice also became the first hurricane of the season as well as the first known cyclone to impact bermuda during july
shortly after alice dissipated over atlantic canada another depression formed
by the end of july two more non @-@ developing depressions formed and the first subtropical cyclone given the name alfa developed off the east coast of the united states
this storm was short @-@ lived and dissipated on august <num> just offshore southern maine
the first half august was relatively quiet with only one depression forming
however later in the month the season 's second hurricane brenda formed in the northwestern caribbean
peaking just below category <num> status on the newly introduced saffir – simpson hurricane scale brenda made the first recorded landfall in the mexican state of campeche
later in august tropical storm christine became the easternmost forming tropical cyclone in the atlantic basin on record developing over the western african country of guinea on august <num>
the system traveled for several thousand miles before dissipating in the eastern caribbean sea in early september
at the start of the month a new tropical storm formed in the gulf of mexico
this storm named delia became the first known cyclone to make landfall in the same city twice
after moving inland a second time delia eventually dissipated on september <num>
as delia dissipated another depression formed in the same region eventually making landfall in the same city as delia freeport texas
another brief depression formed several days later
on september <num> the strongest storm of the season ellen formed over the eastern atlantic
after tracking northwest for several days ellen eventually attained hurricane status as it turned westward
several days later the hurricane turned northeast due to an approaching frontal system
shortly before becoming extratropical ellen reached major hurricane intensity at a record northerly latitude
in late september a brief depression affected northern florida before dissipating
after a week of inactivity the second subtropical storm of the year formed over the central atlantic
this storm named bravo gradually intensified becoming fully tropical at which time it was renamed fran a few days later
upon being renamed fran had intensified into a hurricane and maintained this intensity for several days before dissipating east of the azores on october <num>
a few days after fran dissipated the final named storm of the year formed in the central caribbean sea
a slow moving system gilda gradually intensified just below hurricane @-@ intensity before striking cuba and moving over the bahamas
a few days after passing through the islands gilda became the first storm on record to transition from a tropical cyclone into a subtropical cyclone
a large storm gilda eventually became extratropical near atlantic canada and dissipated later that month
around the time gilda was dissipating a weak depression briefly existed near the azores
the final storm of the year was a strong depression in the southern caribbean sea
this system was active for less than two days but may have briefly attained tropical storm intensity as it made landfall in southern nicaragua
a well @-@ defined circulation became apparent by june <num> and satellite images depicted cyclonic banding features
the following day the system intensified into a tropical depression and shortly thereafter became a tropical storm as reconnaissance aircraft recorded gale @-@ force winds
an area of high pressure to the east of alice steered the storm generally to the north
decreasing wind shear allowed the storm to become increasingly organized and a well @-@ defined eye developed by july <num>
by this time reconnaissance had determined that the storm had intensified into a hurricane with maximum winds reaching <num> mph <num> km h
on july <num> the storm reached its peak intensity with winds of <num> mph <num> km h and a barometric pressure of <num> mbar hpa <num>
<num> inhg as the eastern portion of the eyewall brushed bermuda
after passing the island alice began to accelerate in response to a mid @-@ level trough over the eastern united states and weakened
by july <num> winds head decreased below hurricane intensity as the storm neared atlantic canada
later that day alice made landfall in eastern newfoundland with winds of <num> mph <num> km h before transitioning into an extratropical cyclone
during its passage of bermuda alice produced sustained winds up to <num> mph <num> km h and gusts to <num> mph <num> km h
no major damage was recorded on the island though the winds blew down a few trees and powerlines
the heavy rainfall peaking at <num>
<num> in <num> mm ended a three @-@ month drought in bermuda
although alice tracked through atlantic canada no impact was recorded
gradually the circulation lowered to the surface and developed subtropical characteristics
on july <num> the system attained gale @-@ force winds off the mid @-@ atlantic coast and was named alfa the first name from the list of subtropical storm names for the <year> season
tracking north @-@ northeast the system intensified very little as it paralleled the coastline
by august <num> the system weakened below subtropical storm intensity as it neared new england
the following day alfa dissipated just off the southern coast of maine
the only effects from alfa was light to moderate rainfall in new england peaking at <num>
<num> in <num> mm in turners falls massachusetts
most of southern maine recorded around <num> in <num> mm with a maximum of <num>
<num> in <num> mm in saco
by august <num> the wave began to regenerate as it passed through the lesser antilles
several days later convection associated with the system consolidated into a central organized mass and on august <num> the system had become sufficiently organized to be declared a tropical depression while situated near the yucatán channel
early the next day the depression strengthened into tropical storm brenda as it made landfall in the northern portion of the yucatán peninsula
after moving inland a strong ridge of high pressure over texas forced the storm to take an unusual track eventually leading it to enter the bay of campeche on august <num>
once back over water brenda began to intensify attaining hurricane status late on august <num>
the next day a well @-@ defined eye had developed and the storm attained its peak intensity as a high @-@ end category <num> hurricane with winds of <num> mph <num> km h and a minimum pressure of <num> mbar hpa <num>
<num> inhg
the storm made landfall later that day near ciudad del carmen mexico at this intensity becoming the first hurricane on record to strike the region
after moving inland brenda rapidly weakened to a depression by the morning of august <num> and dissipated later that day
already suffering from severe flooding that killed at least <num> people and left <num> @,@ <num> homeless hurricane brenda worsened the situation with torrential rainfall and additional flooding
the storm killed at least <num> people in the country
following the damage wrought by brenda a large earthquake struck the region hampering relief efforts and collapsing numerous structures
winds on land gusted up to <num> mph <num> km h leading to severe wind damage
two of the fatalities occurred in campeche after <num> of the city was flooded
this was considered the worst flooding in the city in over <num> years
an estimated <num> @,@ <num> people were left homeless as a direct result of brenda throughout mexico
offshore a freighter with <num> crewman became trapped in the storm after its engines failed
they were safely rescued several days later once the storm had dissipated
as it neared the atlantic ocean the wave spawned a tropical depression at <num>
<num> ° w over the country of guinea unlike most cyclone producing waves which travel several hundred miles over water before spawning a depression
although it was already a depression advisories on the storm were not issued until august <num> five days after its formation
for several days the depression maintained its intensity as it steadily tracked west across the atlantic
it eventually attained tropical storm intensity on august <num>
despite the lack of aircraft reconnaissance in the region the intensity was determined by wind readings from a german cargo ship that passed through the storm
on august <num> the first reconnaissance mission into the storm found tropical storm @-@ force winds and the first advisory was issued that day immediately declaring the system as tropical storm christine
three days later christine attained its peak intensity just below hurricane @-@ status with winds of <num> mph <num> km h and a minimum pressure of <num> mbar hpa <num>
<num> inhg
shortly thereafter increasing wind shear caused the storm to weaken as it neared the leeward islands
as it passed over antigua on september <num> christine weakened to a tropical depression and eventually dissipated near the dominican republic later that day
during its passage through the leeward islands christine produced torrential rainfall peaking at <num>
<num> in <num> mm in southeastern puerto rico
these rains led to flooding on several islands
one person was killed during the storm after being electrocuted by a downed power line on a flooded road
schools were closed ahead of the storm in puerto rico and the united states virgin islands as a precaution following the issuance of flood warnings
six scientists had to be evacuated from the small island of aves once the storm posed a threat to them
no major damage was reported on any of the affected islands in the wake of christine
the system gradually developed organized shower and thunderstorm activity
by september <num> a tropical depression developed from the wave
by september <num> the depression had intensified into a tropical storm receiving the name delia and began tracking more towards the west
a complex steering patter began to take place later on that day resulting in the creation of a more hostile environment for tropical cyclones in the gulf of mexico
as delia neared the texas coastline it managed to intensify into a strong tropical storm with winds of <num> mph <num> km h
the lowest pressure was recorded at <num> mbar hpa <num>
<num> inhg at this time
shortly thereafter the cyclone made its first landfall in freeport texas late on september <num>
after executing a counterclockwise loop the storm made landfall in freeport again on september <num>
after moving inland the storm quickly weakened becoming a depression on september <num> before dissipating early the next day over northern mexico
due to the erratic track of the storm along the texas coastline widespread heavy rains fell in areas near the storm and in louisiana
tides up to <num> ft <num>
<num> m in addition to rainfall up to <num>
<num> in <num> mm caused significant flooding in the galveston @-@ freeport area
up to <num> million was reported in damages to homes due to the flooding
throughout louisiana there was substantial flooding of farmland
damages to crops amounted to <num> million
in addition to the flooding rains produced by delia eight tornadoes also touched down due to the storm injuring four people
five people were killed during delia two drowned during floods two died in a car accident and the other died from a heart attack while boarding up his home
the depression remained weak until it reached the texas coastline on september <num>
once onshore it produced significant rainfall causing significant damage that was attributed to tropical storm delia
after turning northeast and tracking inland the depression quickly increased in forward speed before dissipating over north carolina on september <num>
along the coasts of texas and louisiana the depression produced significant amounts of rainfall peaking at <num>
<num> in <num> mm near freeport
several areas in southern louisiana recorded rainfall exceeding <num> in <num> mm with a maximum amount of <num>
<num> in <num> mm falling in kinder
significant rainfall was also recorded in the carolinas and georgia with numerous areas recording over <num> in <num> mm
a maximum of <num>
<num> in <num> mm fell near whitmire south carolina before the system dissipated
in all the depression resulted in an additional <num> million in crop losses in southern louisiana
on the following day the wave spawned an area of low pressure south of the cape verde islands that quickly became a tropical depression
tracking northeast the system intensified into a tropical storm on september <num> after sustained winds of <num> mph <num> km h were reported by a french naval vessel however due to sparse data on the storm the first advisory on ellen was not issued for two more days
a slightly elongated storm ellen gradually intensified over the open atlantic and was steered by two troughs of low pressure
on september <num> the storm took a nearly due west track and the system became increasingly organized with an ill @-@ defined eye becoming present on satellite imagery
the next day ellen intensified into a hurricane before taking a sharp turn to the north @-@ northwest in response to a weak trough moving northeast from the bahamas
gradually the hurricane turned more towards the northeast and began to accelerate as well as intensify
despite being at an unusually high latitude for development the storm underwent a brief period of rapid intensification strengthening into a category <num> hurricane on september <num>
at that time ellen attained its peak intensity with winds of <num> mph <num> km h and a minimum pressure of <num> mbar hpa <num>
<num> inhg
upon attaining this intensity at <num>
<num> ° n ellen had become a major hurricane farther north than any other tropical cyclone on record and is one of two storms to become a major hurricane north of <num> ° n the other being hurricane alex in <year>
shortly after peaking ellen transitioned into an extratropical cyclone before merging with a frontal system several hundred miles east of newfoundland on september <num>
the following day the nhc issued their first advisory on the system declaring it a subtropical depression
the depression was displayed an asymmetrical structure with most winds being recorded up to <num> mi <num> km north of the center
later that day the subtropical depression organized into a tropical depression
upon doing so the nhc issued small craft advisories for coastal areas between north carolina and st
augustine florida
tracking north @-@ northwestward in response to a break in a subtropical ridge to the north the depression eventually made landfall near marineland florida and quickly weakened dissipating before reaching the gulf of mexico
heavy rain fell in association with the depression in parts of florida and georgia
a maximum of <num>
<num> in <num> mm fell in orlando while several other areas recorded over <num> in <num> mm of rain
over land wind gusts reached <num> mph <num> km h in some locations
offshore swells produced by the system reached <num> ft <num>
<num> m impacting several vessels in the region
minor beach erosion and coastal flooding was reported in parts of south carolina as a result of the storm
in parts of coastal georgia high water resulted in several road closures and flooded a few homes
police officers in savannah reported that wave were topping the local seawall however no damage was reported
by october <num> the system interacted with a mid @-@ tropospheric trough near the southeast united states resulting in the formation of a surface low
tracking eastward showers and thunderstorms began to develop around the circulation however the structure of the system was not fully tropical
late on october <num> the cyclone had become sufficiently organized to be classified a subtropical depression
cold air from the remnants of a cold front became entrained within the circulation however the cold air gradually warmed
the following day winds increased to gale @-@ force and the depression was upgraded to a subtropical storm at which time it was given the name bravo
by october <num> bravo had intensified substantially as hurricane hunters recorded hurricane @-@ force winds roughly <num> mi <num> km from the center of the storm
following this finding the national hurricane center reclassified the system as a tropical system and renamed it fran dropping its previous designation of bravo
steered generally eastward by a deep surface low in the westerlies fran accelerated towards the azores islands
shortly after bypassing the islands on october <num> the central pressure of fran decreased to <num> mbar hpa <num>
<num> inhg the lowest recorded in relation to the hurricane
shortly after reaching this intensity the hurricane transitioned into an extratropical cyclone and quickly merged with a cold front off the coast of france
although fran passed near the azores no impact was recorded on any of the islands
it gradually became better organized over the northwestern caribbean sea and on october <num> a tropical depression formed off the coast of nicaragua
as it drifted to the northeast it strengthened to a tropical storm peaking at <num> mph <num> km h winds
before it hit the coast of cuba it weakened enough to cause only minor damage
by the time it struck the island it had become very disorganized in nature
on october <num> cool dry air entered the newly developed convection and as a result it transitioned into a subtropical cyclone
gilda became the first tropical system to pass through a subtropical stage prior to becoming extratropical
the large circulation continued northeast before becoming extratropical on october <num>
the remnants of gilda intensified as they tracked near atlantic canada attaining a central pressure of <num> mbar hpa <num>
<num> inhg near cape race newfoundland
the system eventually dissipated near southern greenland on october <num>
gilda caused heavy rain and mudslides in jamaica destroying six homes and killing six people
in cuba gilda dropped over <num> in <num> mm of rain while <num> mph <num> km h winds were reported in the northern part of the country
in the bahamas gilda caused significant crop damage from heavy rainfall and high tides
the storm 's persistent strong currents and easterly winds caused moderate beach erosion on the east coast of the united states mostly along the florida coast
the extratropical remnants of the storm produced hurricane @-@ force wind gusts over parts of atlantic canada peaking at <num> mph <num> km h however no damage was reported
the first four systems of the year were not classified as fully tropical rather they were associated with the remnants of decaying cold fronts
on april <num> the first of these depressions formed northeast of the bahamas and tracked in a curved motion before dissipating over open water on april <num>
several days later on april <num> another depression formed in the same general region however this system was shorter lived and dissipated two days later without significant movement
on may <num> another partially tropical system formed over open waters
the cyclone tracked northeast and dissipated late on may <num> east @-@ southeast of the azores
on may <num> a brief depression formed near bermuda but dissipated the following day
roughly a week into the official hurricane season the fifth depression of the year formed just offshore southeast florida near miami
the system tracked northwest across the peninsula and briefly entered the gulf of mexico on june <num> before making landfall along the florida panhandle
the depression eventually dissipate on june <num> over south carolina
on june <num> another depression formed along florida this time just onshore near the georgia border
the system slowly tracked northeastward before dissipating on june <num> southeast of the north – south carolina border
as hurricane alice neared bermuda on july <num> a depression formed near the east coast of the united states however the storm dissipated the following day
on july <num> the first cape verde storm formed over the central atlantic
this system did not intensify remaining a weak depression and dissipated on july <num> without affecting land
the next day a new depression formed over the southwestern caribbean sea near the coast of nicaragua
the depression tracked over central america briefly moving back over water in the gulf of honduras before making a second landfall in belize
the system persisted over land for a few days before entering the eastern pacific late on july <num>
only one non @-@ developing depression formed during the month of august an unusually eastward forming system
the depression was first identified just offshore eastern africa on september <num> near where tropical storm christine formed later in the month
tracking rapidly towards the west the depression dissipated on september <num> over open waters
in addition to the two notable tropical depressions and two named storms in september a slow @-@ moving depression formed south @-@ southeast of bermuda on september <num>
tracking generally northward the depression dissipated early on september <num> without affecting land
upon the declaration of hurricane fran on october <num> a new depression formed southwest of the strengthening hurricane
this system rapidly tracked northeast and dissipated two days later
later that month a slow @-@ moving depression formed near the azores
this system tracked southeast and dissipated on october <num> without affecting land
the final system of the year formed near the northern coast of panama on november <num>
the depression was noted as a
strong depression
by the national hurricane center and may have briefly attained tropical storm intensity before making landfall in southern nicaragua on november <num> the system dissipated later that day over land
storms were named christine delia ellen and fran for the first time in <year>
due to the relatively minimal impact caused by storms during the season no names were retired in the spring of <year> however due to the addition of male names in <year> the list was removed and replaced with a new set of names
this year was the second and last year to use the phonetic alphabet
although a storm was given the name bravo it was renamed fran after acquiring tropical characteristics
deaths in parentheses are additional and indirect an example of an indirect death would be a traffic accident but are still storm @-@ related
damage and deaths include totals while the storm was extratropical or a wave or low
formed in late <year> as part of the <num> division the battalion was established to provide direct fire support to the division ’ s infantry brigades
it was the fourth and last such unit raised within the <num> aif
the unit 's personnel were largely drawn from the state of western australia and after formation the battalion concentrated near perth for basic individual training before moving to the adelaide hills to complete more advance manouevres
in late <year> amidst concerns of war in the pacific the unit was deployed north to darwin in the northern territory where they undertook garrison duties in the weeks following japan 's entry into the war
following japanese landings in malaya the <num> <num> embarked from darwin and were transferred to malaya arriving in singapore in the final days of the fighting on the peninsula
in the wake of the withdrawal of british and commonwealth forces to the island the battalion was hastily deployed in support of the two australian brigades — the <num> and <num> brigades — in the north @-@ western sector of the island
during the initial japanese landing elements of the battalion were heavily engaged around the landing beaches but they were outnumbered and over the course of the week the defenders were pushed back towards the centre of the island towards the city of singapore
they suffered heavy casualties during this time before subsequently becoming prisoners of war after the fall of singapore
meanwhile a detachment of about <num> men from the battalion who had been left behind in australia when it deployed to singapore also took part in the fighting on java
after a brief campaign the majority of these personnel were taken into captivity when the allied forces were overwhelmed around buitenzorg in mid @-@ march <year> although some attempted to fight on as guerillas
eventually these men were either killed or captured prisoners remained in japanese captivity until the end of the war in august <year>
during the three @-@ and @-@ a @-@ half years they were held by the japanese members of the <num> <num> were sent to prison camps around the pacific where they were used as slave labour and subjected to harsh conditions and extreme brutality
after the war the surviving members of the battalion were returned to australia but the <num> <num> was not re @-@ raised
motorised infantry units equipped with wheeled motor vehicles and tracked carriers the machine gun battalions were formed to provide a greater level of fire support than that ordinarily available within infantry battalions
developed by the british army the concept had its genesis in the australian army during the gallipoli campaign in <year> when the machine guns assigned to the infantry battalions — initially two and then four — had been grouped together and co @-@ ordinated at brigade level to help compensate for the lack of artillery support
on the western front the concept had evolved through the establishment of machine gun companies in <year> and finally in <year> to the establishment of machine gun battalions
similar formations had also been established among the australian light horse units serving in the sinai and palestine campaign
during the inter @-@ war years the machine gun battalions had been deemed unnecessary
they were not re @-@ raised when the army was reorganised in <year> but in <year> as the australian army looked to expand owing to fears of war in europe four such units were formed within the part @-@ time militia by converting light horse units and motorising them
several other militia machine gun battalions were also raised as new units later after the second world war began
these were formed by consolidating the machine gun companies assigned to a number of infantry battalions and other light horse units were also converted into the role for use as garrison forces
within the <num> aif — australia 's overseas expeditionary force — the decision was made to raise four machine gun battalions as corps troops that were usually allocated at a rate of one per division several of the militia units were also later designated australian imperial force units after the majority of their personnel volunteered for overseas service
this meant that they could be deployed outside of australian territory even though they were not <num> aif units
in mid @-@ <year> amid the tide of german successes in europe there was an influx of volunteers for the <num> aif
as a result the australian government decided to raise a third volunteer division for overseas service named the <num> division
established around three infantry brigades — the <num> <num> and <num> — the division was supported by corps troops including engineers cavalry artillery pioneers and a machine gun battalion for direct fire support
within this formation the <num> <num> machine gun battalion came into being on <num> november <year> when lieutenant colonel michael anketell a first world war veteran who had commanded a militia infantry battalion before the war established his headquarters at northam camp near perth western australia
while the rest of the <num> division had drawn its personnel mainly from the more populous eastern states of new south wales and victoria the decision was made to select personnel for the <num> <num> only from those who were already enlisted and conducting training in the west
while potentially parochial it was a primarily a pragmatic decision to reduce the time it would take to concentrate the unit and complete its training
like most <num> aif units the <num> <num> drew its cadre staff of officers and senior non @-@ commissioned officers ncos from volunteers from local militia units
these were augmented by partially trained other ranks ors from the three local recruit training depots the first batch of these numbering <num> men arrived at northam on <num> november and a further <num> marched in on <num> december
as the battalion was brought up to its authorised strength of around <num> men personnel were formed into four machine gun companies a to d under a headquarters company consisting of several specialist platoons — including signals and anti @-@ aircraft platoons — and battalion headquarters
there were no platoon commanders until a contingent arrived from the regional officer training units
initially training was hampered by a lack of equipment — only <num> of <num> vickers machine guns assigned to the battalion were available — so at the start the focus was on individual rather than collective training
as more stores arrived training accelerated with the help of experienced militia ncos and first world war veterans who were brought in to share their experiences with the new troops
just before christmas and new year 's leave the battalion received its distinctive unit colour patch a black and gold triangle
early in the new year the establishment of the battalion 's command formation was completed with the appointment of subalterns as platoon commanders following their return from their first appointment courses
the training continuum evolved with the establishment of an nco school and various specialist courses including range finding and transport a bugle and drum band was also raised
in february <year> training focused upon skill @-@ at @-@ arms before undertaking a <num> @-@ mile <num> km march from northam to perth which was conducted over the course of three days and was undertaken according to the australian war memorial to test the physical fitness and endurance of the personnel and officers and the efficiency of the battalion 's motor transport and administration personnel
upon their return training progressed to field firing night manoeuvres portage defensive exercises and further specialised training continuing until july by which time the battalion was considered ready for deployment
that month it received orders to move to adelaide south australia
proceeding in four drafts — one each on the transports katoomba and duntroon and two by rail — they were established at woodside in the adelaide hills by the end of the month
the battalion endured a bitter winter conducting field exercises amidst the steep wooded slopes of the mount lofty range these became more tactically complex and physically demanding as anketell worked the battalion up to a peak of efficiency in preparation for deployment amidst growing tensions in the pacific
with this the only <num> aif troops remaining in australia were those of the <num> brigade
as a result of concerns about japanese intentions in the region the decision was made to move the brigade north to bolster the defences around darwin in the northern territory
in the event of fighting in the pacific the government planned to split infantry battalions to defend the island chain to australia ’ s north dispatching forces to rabaul ambon and timor
the role of the corps troops from the <num> <num> pioneers and <num> <num> machine gun battalion remained uncertain
the <num> division ’ s commander major general gordon bennett unhappy with the dispersal of his command had been agitating for the dispatch of the machine gunners to malaya to support his two infantry brigades arguing that they would be valuable for beach defence
bennett 's request had been rejected initially in march due to the limited numbers of recruits enlisting but by mid @-@ september elements at army headquarters in melbourne had also begun to advocate for it
in early october following a war cabinet decision to split the command of the <num> division in two removing the elements in australia from bennett 's command the <num> <num> machine gun battalion received orders to move north to darwin where it was to serve in a home defence role in case of a japanese attack
on <num> october <year> the battalion entrained at oakbank and began the journey north
they detrained at alice springs where they camped overnight before continuing the journey by road in a <num> @-@ vehicle convoy which took them further north to larrimah
there they once again entrained for the final journey to winnellie which they reached on <num> october after overnighting in katherine
at winnellie the battalion was allocated a large defensive zone between nightcliff lee point and shoal bay which included a large beach frontage as well as extensive swamp lands and creeks further inland
throughout november extensive work was undertaken improving the camp and preparing this position with fortified emplacements
they also undertook various other garrison duties such as guarding ammunition dumps and road and railway construction
heavy summer rains flooded the camp and surrounding area and as well as hampering construction brought a wave of dengue fever amongst the battalion and the threat of crocodile attacks as the creeks within the battalion position swelled the battalion ’ s mascot a dog named gunner fell victim
news of the japanese attack on pearl harbor and invasion of malaya came in early december and with it a need to bolster australian forces in the pacific
as bennett pressed harder for reinforcements on <num> december the <num> <num> machine gun battalion received orders to embark for malaya
arriving on <num> january <year> they were transferred to the transport aquitania which was to take them the rest of the way
before they had completed transferring the battalion ’ s equipment news was received that rabaul about <num> miles <num> km north @-@ east had been bombed by carrier @-@ based aircraft
due to concerns that the aircraft may have been looking for the convoy or us warships fleeing the philippines and that port moresby might be bombed next the convoy ’ s departure was advanced and so they sailed immediately
instead of proceeding to malaya though they were taken to sydney new south wales as it was decided that it would be safer to proceed via the southern route
after a brief stay in sydney where the battalion ’ s equipment deficiencies were made good and some reinforcements were received from local recruit training depots they embarked again on <num> january in company with hmas canberra and proceeded through the bass strait
as they were under way the troops were kept occupied with training on the bren light machine gun and the thompson sub @-@ machine gun quantities of which were hastily added to the battalion ’ s equipment scale
they reached fremantle western australia on <num> january and overnight a large number of <num> <num> men defied orders to stay aboard ship and went ashore to spend time with their families when the aquitania sailed the next day <num> men were left behind
the situation in malaya was grave as the japanese were steadily pushing the british and commonwealth defenders south down the peninsula and as the gravity of the situation dawned upon the australian government a knee @-@ jerk reaction saw the dispatch of <num> partially trained reinforcements from northam
they arrived just as the aquitania departed being ferried out to rottnest island where they joined the ship ’ s company late in the afternoon of <num> january
although the reinforcements made good the men that had been left behind they were only partially trained and ill @-@ prepared for the fighting that would follow
after departing fremantle the convoy steamed towards java and reached ratai bay early on <num> january
proceeding on to the sunda strait which was reached mid @-@ morning on <num> january and the men were then transferred to a number of smaller faster dutch ships to run the gauntlet of japanese bombers that were attacking allied shipping in the area
in concert with several australian british and indian escorts and two dutch catalina flying boats the convoy entered keppel harbour on <num> january <year>
upon arrival in singapore consisting of <num> personnel of all ranks the battalion was allocated to the task of preparing machine gun positions on singapore ’ s north coast and around the naval base
they stepped into a maelstrom the japanese were bombing the naval base — where the <num> <num> were accommodated — every day and the fighting on the malay peninsula was all but over
having been pushed back down the peninsula over the course of seven weeks in the final week of january the allies withdrew from johore on the mainland to singapore where they would make a final stand
covering the withdrawal the <num> brigade was the last australian unit to cross the <num> @-@ foot <num> m wide causeway before it was blown up early on the morning of <num> january to prevent the japanese from capturing it and to slow their advance
one of only two machine gun battalions available for the defending british and commonwealth forces as preparations were made to repulse the expected japanese assault across the johore strait the battalion was split up to provide support to troops from the <num> and <num> australian infantry brigades and the <num> indian infantry brigade around the western part of the island where the japanese assault was expected
on <num> february due to concerns about the lack of defending infantry about <num> machine gun reinforcements who had been hastily formed into a sixth company — e — were detached at this time to form part of a <num> @-@ strong special reserve battalion initially under the command of an officer from the <num> <num> infantry battalion and later taken over by major albert saggers formerly of the <num> <num> machine gun battalion
d company positioned in various locations in support of the australian <num> brigade in the north @-@ western area found themselves in the thick of the fighting as the japanese concentrated their landing on the australian <num> division front
understrength and stretched out across a large frontage over ground that was unsuited to defence the australians were almost immediately under pressure
shortly after <num> <num> pm <num> platoon supporting the <num> <num> infantry battalion around the head of the lim chu kang road was confronted by a large number of landing barges filled with japanese assault troops
for almost six hours the platoon under lieutenant eric wankey fought a desperate action to repel the invaders
with four machine guns as well as personal small arms and grenades the platoon inflicted heavy casualties on the japanese and sank several barges
despite heavy casualties from japanese mortar and machine gun fire they kept fighting until early in the morning on <num> february when threatened with being outflanked and low on ammunition — each gun had fired over <num> @,@ <num> rounds — and having had one gun knocked out the platoon was forced to withdraw
destroying their equipment as they went to prevent it from being captured the platoon was forced to withdraw in contact taking their wounded with them the action was later rewarded with a military cross for the platoon commander who was badly wounded after taking over one of the machine guns after its crew had been wounded
near the sungei murai murai river <num> platoon — under lieutenant john meiklejohn — had been stationed in support of a company from the <num> <num> infantry battalion in a thickly wooded area with low hills and many inlets
<num> platoon established an enfilade formation near the shore with its machine guns distributed in two sections on a north – south axis facing a narrow peninsula between the mouth of the murai and a small inlet
according to the official history by lionel wigmore after a japanese landing party approached the southern section under meiklejohn opened fire against six approaching barges and kept on firing for two hours despite retaliation by hand grenades as the japanese landed and crossed the neck of the peninsula
as was the case elsewhere in the extremely wide sector assigned to the <num> brigade many japanese landing parties were able to outflank the thinly @-@ spread australian positions
at risk of being cut off and with ammunition running low meiklejohn ordered the southern section to retreat
according to wigmore meiklejohn led his section along a jungle path where they came upon a party of japanese resting
he shot some with his revolver and another was knocked out with a swing from a machine gun tripod but meiklejohn lost his life in attempting to cover his section 's withdrawal
the northern section of <num> platoon held its ground until it was informed that a near @-@ by infantry platoon was almost surrounded and about to withdraw
forced to retreat without its machine guns the northern section also found japanese troops blocking its path
when private cliff spackman was attacked by a japanese officer wielding a sword spackman bayoneted him took the sword and used it against another japanese soldier
as the situation worsened early on <num> february a company which had been in reserve and hq company were sent forward to provide further assistance to the <num> infantry brigade which was slowly being pushed back towards the tactically important tengah airfield via the village of ama keng
they took up positions at bulim east of the airfield shortly afterwards they were joined by <num> platoon from ‘ b ’ company which had been detached from the causeway sector
the remnants of the <num> numbering around only <num> men from its original <num> @,@ <num> with a further <num> or so isolated and attempting to fight their way through was pushed further back throughout the day
orders were passed for a counter @-@ attack around the airfield but as the size of japanese forces in the area grew to around <num> @,@ <num> men they were later cancelled in favour of establishing a line between bulim and jurong to the east of the airfield
established in the early afternoon within this line the <num> <num> 's a company was positioned east of bulim with <num> platoon b company while the remnants of d company amounting to only <num> men were moved south where they joined with c company which was supporting the indian <num> brigade which although it had not yet been engaged had fallen back from the south @-@ west coast to avoid being cut off and had established itself west of ulu pandan behind the sungei jurong
late on <num> february the japanese made more landings in the causeway sector held by the <num> infantry brigade
despite having been reduced to just two infantry battalions due to the transfer of the <num> <num> to the hard @-@ pressed <num> infantry brigade they were able to mount a stiff defence supported by the machine guns of ‘ b ’ company
<num> platoon inflicted many casualties in the japanese landing craft coming ashore at the mouth of the sungei mandi
with casualties mounting and pressure being placed on the brigade 's rear due to a large gap that had developed around kranji by the japanese advances in the <num> infantry brigade 's area the decision was made to withdraw from the beach and realign north – south along the woodlands road
further south the australian <num> and indian <num> <num> <num> and <num> infantry brigades also established themselves along this axis between bukit panjang and pasir panjang on the south coast and by early evening on <num> february the japanese had secured the entire west coast of the island
for the next four days the allied troops were pushed south @-@ east towards the city of singapore
throughout this time the battalion ’ s companies were in almost constant action either — in the case of b c d and e companies — under separate command or a and hq companies with battalion headquarters
the reinforcements of e company detached to the special reserve battalion suffered heavily
in three days they lost <num> men killed or missing before the ad hoc formation was disbanded and the men returned to the <num> <num>
<num> platoon b company took on a mounted role procuring four bren carriers with which they began patrolling in support
on <num> february they were engaged along the buona vista road while supporting the malayan regiment
the following day they were attacked by a japanese light tank which knocked out one of the carriers before the platoon extricated themselves
by <num> february the allied troops had withdrawn into a small perimeter around the city
the <num> division were holding a position <num> miles <num>
<num> km east of the city centred upon the axis of the holland road with its headquarters at tanglin barracks
with the japanese gaining ground to their north and south through the porous lines of the indian <num> and british <num> brigades the situation became critical
threatened with being cut off anketell began to plan a last stand moving forward to survey the situation he was badly wounded by mortar and small arms fire and after being evacuated to alexandra hospital died of his wounds late in the evening of <num> february
despite his loss the battalion kept on fighting to the very end sending out patrols throughout the following day and severely mauling a japanese vehicle convoy that came too close to their position
late on <num> february the british commander lieutenant general arthur percival gave the order to surrender
the physical process of the surrender was slow and despite orders to surrender weapons and ammunition the men proceeded to destroy the majority of their equipment the following morning before the japanese arrived
later they were marched to changi prison during which several men from the battalion attempted to escape after the japanese began executing several prisoners one the regimental sergeant major fred airey successfully made it to sumatra but was later recaptured there while another private les mccann remained on the run for eight days before being recaptured after collapsing from bullet wounds he had received during the attempt
the majority of these were the <num> men that had failed to return in time from their unofficial leave in fremantle
after missing their ship they had been arrested by the military police and were confined to quarters in karrakatta camp for two weeks
on <num> january they were released and under the command of two officers and a small group of ncos they embarked upon marella which set out for singapore via palembang in batavia escorted by canberra
after reaching tanjong priok on <num> february the detachment found itself placed under dutch command and formed into a composite infantry company within the reserve battalion of the ad hoc formation known as blackforce which had been formed under brigadier arthur blackburn
at the end of the month having taken sumatra the japanese invaded java with three divisions and a strong naval task force
fierce fighting at sea ensued during which <num> out of a force of <num> allied ships were sunk
several japanese transports were also sunk but the majority of japanese troops were landed
the detachment from the <num> <num> found itself around buitenzorg where the majority of the <num> <num> personnel formed part of an ad hoc infantry force known as the reserve group or <num> battalion consisting of eight platoons under major john champion de crespigny
they fought several defensive actions before being overwhelmed and taken into captivity on <num> march <year>
a small number continued to fight as guerrillas but were eventually all captured
some of the men were held in camps in java and sumatra although the majority were later sent to singapore before being transported to camps elsewhere in south @-@ east asia
a total of <num> men were taken into captivity including most of the wounded
four men managed to escape to australia but of the remaining men <num> died while prisoners of war
following their capture the men from the <num> <num> in singapore were concentrated in changi prison before being split up and sent to various prison camps around the pacific including borneo burma thailand java sumatra japan and formosa
there they were used as slave labour on the burma – thai railway in coal mines and on wharves during which they were subjected to harsh treatment starvation disease and extreme brutality which took a heavy toll
many soldiers from the <num> <num> were also killed while being taken to japan when the ships were sunk by allied submarines
throughout their captivity some soldiers continued to contribute to the allied war effort building a series of home @-@ made radios with which they transmitted japanese shipping movements to british forces in india and through which they were able to gain news from home
they were liberated in august <year> and after the war the surviving members of the battalion were returned to australia but the <num> <num> was not re @-@ raised
members of the battalion received the following decorations one military cross one distinguished conduct medal two british empire medals and nine mentions in despatches in addition one member of the battalion was appointed as a member of the order of the british empire
after the war the australian army moved away from the machine gun battalion concept and no similar units were raised
the machine gun role was subsumed into the support companies of individual infantry battalions
the idea was arguably misunderstood by australian commanders throughout the war and this may have influenced the decision to move away from the concept
when the units had been established the intent had been for machine gun battalions to provide highly mobile fire support but this only worked where the principles of open warfare worked
once the focus of australian army combat operations shifted to the pacific the machine gun battalions were largely misused being employed in a static defensive capacity against short and medium range targets or for menial tasks rather than as offensive weapons for long range fire support
the medium machine guns were also largely used in the same manner as light machine guns such as the bren
other reasons identified for the concept 's limited use include distrust of overhead fire by some commanders a preference for organic fire support over attached sub @-@ units over @-@ estimating the difficulty of transporting vickers guns in the jungle and a tendency to ignore targets that could not be seen
the difficulties of target acquisition in dense jungle also contributed
en route to the republican party 's presidential nomination nixon faced challenges from governor george romney of michigan governor nelson rockefeller of new york governor ronald reagan of california and senator charles percy of illinois
nixon won nine of the thirteen state primaries held that season although due to the population of his state governor reagan won the popular vote while carrying only california
these victories along with pledged delegate support from states not holding primaries secured nixon the nomination on the first ballot of the republican national convention where he named governor spiro agnew of maryland as his running mate
in the general election nixon emphasized law and order positioning himself as the champion of what he called the silent majority
running well ahead of his opponent incumbent vice president hubert humphrey his support slipped in the polls following his refusal to partake in presidential debates and following an announcement from president lyndon b
johnson that a halt in bombing of vietnam had been negotiated
winning a close election on november <num> <year> nixon and agnew were inaugurated as the <num> president of the united states and <num> vice president of the united states respectively on january <num> <year>
he was the first vice president elected president since martin van buren in <year> and the only one to do so while not an incumbent
as a member of congress he gained a reputation as a firm anti @-@ communist
in <year> he was selected by general dwight d
eisenhower the republican nominee for president as his vice presidential nominee
elected together with eisenhower he served as vice president during the height of the cold war
in office he traveled the world on goodwill tours promoting pro @-@ american policies he was re @-@ elected with eisenhower in <year>
at the end of eisenhower 's second term in <year> nixon ran unopposed for the republican nomination which he received
he lost a close race to senator john f
kennedy of massachusetts which many credited in part to his unhealthy appearance during the first televised debate
nixon ran for governor of california against incumbent pat brown and was defeated handily leading the media to label him as a loser
this defeat was widely believed to be the end of his career in an impromptu concession speech the morning after the election nixon famously blamed the media for favoring his opponent saying you won 't have nixon to kick around anymore because gentlemen this is my last press conference
in september the new york post published an article claiming that campaign donors were buying influence with nixon by providing him with a secret cash fund for his personal expenses
he moved to new york joining the mudge rose guthrie alexander ferdon law firm and regrouped considering but decided against a run for president in <year> beginning to plan for a <year> presidential campaign
he asked the attendees not to discuss the meeting with anyone but to spread subtle hints that he would run for president
the next month during an interview with the saturday evening post nixon flatly denied he was running for president
nevertheless polls suggested that he was the front @-@ runner for the nomination
the gallup poll from february <year> showed nixon leading governor george romney his closest rival <num> to <num>
at this time he quietly began efforts to organize in indiana nebraska new hampshire oregon and wisconsin positioning to secure victories in those states primaries the following year
in march he gained the support of the <year> republican nominee senator barry goldwater of arizona a nixon for president committee formed that month and headquarters for the organization opened in washington d
c
in late may
during the spring and summer nixon traveled to eastern europe and latin america to bolster his foreign policy credentials
he returned in august to conduct meetings with his advisers to formulate a solid campaign strategy
two days later his campaign manager gaylord parkinson left his position to care for his ailing wife
political commentators speculated that the vacancy built an element of instability for the campaign
the position was soon temporarily filled by former governor henry bellmon of oklahoma
the next week five staff members were fired after private investigators determined that information had been leaked to the campaigns of potential primary rivals governors rockefeller and reagan
the news did not stall the progression of the campaign and soon nixon mudge rose guthrie alexander member leonard garment assembled an advertising team that included cbs television president frank shakespeare
nixon hoped the moves would increase his delegate strength and demonstrate his ability to win
he notified the media that his decision on whether to run for president would be formally announced anytime between early december and february
meanwhile nixon and his staff discussed handling the topic of the vietnam war
they advised him to soften his stance on the war and encouraged him to shift his focus from foreign affairs to domestic policy to avoid the divisive war issue
observers noted that this move potentially hurt nixon by straying from his reputation as a foreign policy expert
in october political experts predicted that nixon would gain delegates in the important states of new hampshire wisconsin and nebraska during the primary season scheduled to begin in march <year>
they noted that in the other critical state of oregon ronald reagan would have an advantage due to the proximity of his home state
like nixon rival george romney began to organize in these states
romney officially announced his candidacy in november prompting nixon to step up his efforts
he spent most of this period on the campaign trail in new hampshire
those following nixon noted that during this period he seemed more relaxed and easygoing than in his past political career
one commentator examined that he was not the drawn tired figure who debated jack kennedy or the angry politician who conceded his california gubernatorial defeat with such ill grace
making appearances at fundraisers in his adopted home state of new york nixon helped to raise <num> @,@ <num> for the re @-@ election campaign of senator jacob k
javits
at the end of december time labeled nixon as the man to beat
however polls suggested that in a head @-@ to @-@ head match up with incumbent president lyndon johnson nixon trailed <num> to <num>
later in january nixon embarked on a tour of texas where he lampooned president johnson 's state of the union address asking can this nation afford to have four more years of lyndon johnson 's policies that have failed at home and abroad at this time reports suggested that nixon would formally announce his bid in february
immediately following his entrance the media team prepared for an advertising campaign
they analyzed video of nixon determining that he was at his best when speaking spontaneously
the team organized a question and answer session with seven members of the new hampshire republican party taping nixon 's responses for editing and use in advertisements
he campaigned in the state although polls suggested that he would easily win its primary
as a result he began campaigning in wisconsin where the second primary would be held
during a stop he briefly discussed vietnam although not in detail stating that the united states must prevent such confrontations but that the nation must also help people in the free world fight against aggression but not do their fighting for them
he used those dictatorships in latin america as an example stating i am talking not about marching feet but helping hands
as military operations increased in vietnam in mid @-@ february nixon 's standing against president johnson improved
a harris poll showed that he trailed the president <num> to <num>
near the end of the month nixon 's opponent george romney exited the race mostly due to comments he made about being brainwashed during a visit to vietnam
this left nixon nearly unopposed for the upcoming primaries narrowing his opponents to nelson rockefeller and ronald reagan neither of whom had announced their candidacies
due to romney 's exit nixon declared in early march that he would greatly expand his efforts in the non @-@ primary states with time observing that nixon could now focus his political attacks solely on president johnson
however the void also caused problems for nixon time argued that the prospect of soundly defeating second @-@ tier candidates such as former governor harold stassen of minnesota in the primaries would not electrify the voters
the nixon campaign countered this claim stating that romney 's withdrawal was a tko at the hands of nixon
meanwhile rockefeller began to be viewed more as a candidate articulating that while not wishing to split the party he was willing to serve
if called
as talks of other candidates persisted nixon continued to campaigning and discussion of the issues
he pledged to end the war in vietnam but would not go into detail drawing some criticism
nixon easily won the new hampshire primary on march <num> pulling in <num> of the vote with a write @-@ in campaign for rockefeller receiving <num>
at the end of march rockefeller announced that he would not campaign for the presidency but would be open to being drafted
nixon doubted a draft stating that it would only be likely if i make some rather serious mistake
reports suggested that the decision caused nixon 's political stock to skyrocket
polling by gallup at this time revealed that nixon led president johnson <num> to <num> in a three @-@ way race with american independent party candidate and former governor george wallace of alabama
as the wisconsin primary loomed in early april nixon 's only obstacle seemed to be preventing his supporters from voting in the democratic primary for senator eugene mccarthy of minnesota as a protest against president johnson
however johnson withdrew from the race before the primary meanwhile governor reagan 's name was on the ballot in wisconsin but he did not campaign in the state and was still not a declared candidate
nixon won the primary with <num> followed by reagan with <num> and stassen with <num>
with johnson removed from the race nixon fell behind democratic candidates eugene mccarthy hubert humphrey and robert kennedy in head @-@ to @-@ head match @-@ ups
at the end of april nixon called for a moratorium on criticism of the johnson policy in vietnam as negotiations were underway the one man who can do anything about peace is lyndon johnson and i 'm not going to do anything to undercut him
however the democratic candidates for president remained fair game for criticism
he argued that a divided democratic party cannot unite a divided country a united republican party can
he also began to discuss economics more frequently announcing plans to cut spending while criticizing the democrats policy of raising taxes
during a question and answer session with the american society of newspaper editors nixon spoke out of turn receiving numerous interruptions of applause
the largest came when he addressed the issue of crime proclaiming that there cannot be order in a free society without progress and there cannot be progress without order
on the last day of april rockefeller announced that he would campaign for the presidency despite his previous statement to the contrary
immediately following his entrance he defeated nixon in the massachusetts primary <num> to <num>
new harris polls found that rockefeller fared better against democratic candidates than nixon but the outlook started to appear better for nixon after he won the indiana primary over rockefeller
off the victory nixon campaigned in nebraska where he criticized the three leading democratic candidates as three peas in a pod prisoners of the policies of the past
he then proposed a plan to tackle crime that included wiretapping legislation to reverse previous supreme court decisions and the formation of a congressional committee targeting crime and reforms to the criminal justice system
he did not connect crime to racial rioting drawing praise from civil rights leaders
nixon won the primary in nebraska defeating the undeclared reagan <num> to <num>
at the following primary in oregon reagan seemed more willing to compete with nixon and rockefeller sat out
but nixon won with <num> fifty points ahead of reagan
in early june nixon continued to be regarded as the favorite to win the nomination but observers noted that he had not yet locked up the nomination
he still faced challenges from nelson rockefeller and ronald reagan and was not on the ballot in california where reagan won a large slate of delegates
behind the scenes nixon staff lobbied for delegates from favorite son candidates resulting in the backing of senator howard baker of tennessee and his <num> pledged delegates as well as those <num> delegates supporting senator charles percy of illinois
after the assassination of robert kennedy like the other candidates nixon took a break from campaigning
reports suggested that the assassination all but assured his nomination
upon returning to the trail nixon found that rockefeller had begun attacking him
rockefeller described nixon as a man of the old politics who has great natural capacity not to do the right thing especially under pressure
nixon refused to respond to the jabs stating that he would not participate in attacks
as he edged closer to the nomination discussions about his running mate arose
republicans in the midwest pushed for mayor john lindsay of new york city
the endorsement of nixon by senator mark hatfield of oregon raised speculation that he might be chosen
congressman george bush of texas and senator percy were also mentioned as possible selections
at the end of the month nixon had two thirds of the required <num> delegates necessary to win the nomination
on july <num> nixon received the endorsement of senator john g
tower of texas handing him at least <num> delegates
with his nomination all but assured nixon 's ad team began preparing for the general election
a series of advertisements featuring question and answer sessions with nixon and friends of campaign staffers were filmed in new york
the tapes were sent to the swing states of illinois michigan and ohio giving nixon the advantage of advertising long before the democratic party settled on a candidate
at this time nixon decided with a group of legislators that crime and disorder would be presented as the number one issue in the nation
this continued to be a major theme of the nixon campaign and would continue to be used extensively during the general election
nixon publicly announced his opposition to the military draft proposing to replace the current system with a volunteer army encouraged with higher pay
president eisenhower endorsed nixon in mid @-@ july breaking his tradition of waiting until after the primary due to the election 's importance
by july 's end reports circulated that nixon had <num> probable delegates for the convention placing him over the <num> delegate threshold rockefeller however disputed these numbers
sources within washington reported that reagan caused greater concern for the nixon campaign than rockefeller
a possible scenario surfaced where nixon 's southern delegates would drop their support to back the more conservative reagan
nonetheless nixon staffers believed that if such a scenario occurred liberal rockefeller delegates in the northeast would support nixon to prevent a reagan nomination
at the convention richard nixon won the nomination for president on the first ballot with <num> delegates
behind him finished governor rockefeller second with <num> delegates followed by governor ronald reagan in third place having just entered the race accruing <num> delegates
nixon 's early nomination occurred partly because he held on to delegates in the south largely influenced by senator strom thurmond of south carolina and delegate charlton lyons of louisiana
following nomination nixon held his hands in the air with his trademark v sign of victory delivering an acceptance speech written over the preceding weeks
in his speech he remarked tonight i do not promise the millennium in the morning
i don 't promise that we can eradicate poverty and end discrimination in the space of four or even eight years
but i do promise action
and a new policy for peace abroad a new policy for peace and progress and justice at home
fmr
vice president richard nixon <year> republican nominee for president he called for a new era of negotiation with communist nations and a strengthening of the criminal justice system to restore law and order
marking himself as a champion of the american dream he stressed greater unity invoking the silent majority
nixon also discussed economics articulating his opposition to social welfare advocating programs designed to help african americans start their own small businesses
by the end of his address he promised that the long dark night for america is about to end
following the speech nixon formally selected governor spiro agnew of maryland as his running mate who received <num> delegate votes with the distant second being governor romney with <num>
agnew was relatively unknown nationally and was selected due to his purported appeal to african americans and work for the nixon campaign after an embarrassing experience as the head of the draft rockefeller movement
it was later noted that the convention had featured nixon as the centrist candidate with rockefeller to his left and reagan to his right
the same analysis applied to the general campaign as commentators noted that nixon would stand to the right of the still undecided democratic nominee but would fall to the left of american independent party candidate george wallace
he hired roger ailes whom he had first encountered during an appearance on the the mike douglas show to produce one hour television programs to advertise the campaign in strategic regions
the campaign also continued to use televised town hall segments throughout the campaign which aired live featuring real voters whom were instructed to ask tough questions following the campaign 's belief that nixon would respond well to such questions
starting the ground campaign tour during his first stop in springfield illinois he discussed the importance of unity stating that america now needs to be united more than any time since lincoln
he then traveled to michigan ohio and pennsylvania before returning to new york meeting with governor rockefeller
in those gallup polls following the convention nixon led humphrey <num> to <num> and topped mccarthy <num> to <num>
at the end of the month hubert humphrey narrowly won democratic presidential nominee over mccarthy at the democratic convention which was filled with protest and riots
analysts saw the democrat 's split along with lacking law and order at the convention positioning nixon well
shortly before the convention and throughout the general election nixon received regular briefings from president johnson on developments in the vietnam war
the president made it clear to nixon that he did not want the war to be politicized to which nixon agreed although questioning humphrey 's eventual compliance
following the democratic convention nixon was consistently labeled the favorite described as relaxed and confident counter to his unsure self from <year>
even observers speculated as to the president 's possible favoring nixon to humphrey
in a visit to chicago shortly after the democratic convention nixon received a large welcome and ticker tape parade with crowds estimated at several hundred thousand
before his visit he called upon senator edward brooke of massachusetts the highest ranking african american in u
s
government to campaign with him on trips to illinois and california
referring to brooke as one of my top advisers he accompanied campaign stops in chicago and san francisco a move critics described as an attempt to further gain favor within the african american community
at this time nixon sent his adviser former governor william scranton of pennsylvania on a fact finding trip to europe to gather intelligence on western alliance and soviet issues
in response to humphrey 's calls for a face to face debate nixon remarked before we can have a debate between nixon and humphrey humphrey 's got to settle his debate with himself
nixon campaigned in san francisco in front of <num> @,@ <num> supporters amidst an array of protests
the candidate took on the protesters first hand and delivered his forgotten american speech declaring that election day would be a day of protest for the forgotten american a group which included those that obey the law pay their taxes go to church send their children to school love their country and demand new leadership
by month 's end many in the nixon campaign believed his election was guaranteed beginning to prepare for the transition period despite nixon 's warning that the one thing that can beat us now is overconfidence
gallup showed nixon leading humphrey <num> to <num> at the end of september
however anti @-@ war protesters heckled nixon repeatedly on the campaign trail
nixon addressed the american conservative union on october <num> and argued that george wallace 's american independent party candidacy could split the anti @-@ administration vote and help the democrats
the union decided to back nixon over wallace labeling the third party candidate 's beliefs as populist
as democratic vice presidential nominee edmund muskie criticized nixon for his connections to strom thurmond nixon continued to oppose a possible debate with humphrey and wallace as well as between running mates on the basis that he did not want to give wallace more exposure
it was also argued that nixon opposed debating due to his experience during the <year> encounter with john f
kennedy which many cited as a factor in his defeat
in another lesson learned from <year> the campaign employed <num> @,@ <num> workers to oversee election day polling sites to prevent a recurrence of what many republicans viewed as <year> 's stolen election
nixon went on a whistle @-@ stop train tour of ohio near the end of october
from the back of the nixon victory special car he bashed vice president humphrey as well as the secretary of agriculture and attorney general of the johnson cabinet for farmers debt and rising crime
at this time the campaign released two controversial television advertisements juxtaposing a smiling humphrey with images of the vietnam war and the chaos at the <year> democratic national convention the advertisements aroused protests from the humphrey campaign
by october 's end nixon began to lose his edge over humphrey gallup showing he led <num> to <num> down five points from a few weeks earlier a decline observers attributed to nixon 's refusal for a debate with humphrey
at this time nixon operative anna chennault secretly spoke with the south vietnamese explaining that they could receive a better deal under nixon
the charge that along with remarks from nixon supporter and future secretary of defense melvin laird johnson had deliberately misinformed nixon during briefs angered the president
he spoke with nixon supporters senate minority leader everett dirksen and senator george smathers of florida informing nixon of the president 's frustration
on the sunday preceding the election nixon appeared on meet the press explaining that he would cooperate completely with johnson phoning the president shortly thereafter to personally reassure him
the final harris poll before the election indicated that nixon was trailing humphrey <num> to <num> but gallup 's final poll showed nixon leading <num> to <num>
on the eve of the election nixon and humphrey bought time on rival television networks nixon appearing on nbc humphrey on abc where each made his final appeal to voters
nixon used this appearance to counter humphrey 's october surprise a polling surge following the bombing halt claiming that he had just received a very disturbing report which detailed that tons of supplies were being moved into south vietnam by the north
humphrey labeled this charge as irresponsible causing nixon to counter that humphrey doesn 't know what 's going on
overall nixon spent <num> @,@ <num> @,@ <num> on television advertising most of which was judged to have only reinforced supporters
the results were very close and not until early the following morning could news organizations call the election
in the end nixon won <num> electoral votes with humphrey receiving <num> and wallace receiving <num>
in a margin <num>
<num> to <num>
<num> nixon edged humphrey in the popular vote with wallace earning <num>
<num>
nixon 's victory came with a margin of less than three percent in california illinois and ohio had humphrey carried these three nixon would have lost his election
nixon won most of the west and mid @-@ west but lost parts of the northeast and texas to humphrey and lost the deep south to wallace
after the election was conceded by vice president humphrey nixon said the following in his press conference as you will probably have heard i have received a very gracious message from the vice president congratulating me for winning the election
i congratulated him for his gallant and courageous fight against great odds
i also told him that i know exactly how he felt
i know how it feels to lose a close one
following the election the slogan bring us together referencing a poster held by a <num> @-@ year @-@ old girl at a rally during his campaign was used as a basis for the theme of his inauguration although it would later be seized by democrats to attack later nixon policies
in his inaugural address nixon said that the greatest honor history can bestow is the title of peacemaker outlining the direction nixon sought to take such as his visit to the people 's republic of china in <year> opening diplomatic relations between the two nations and détente plus the anti @-@ ballistic missile treaty with the soviet union all in his first term
while overseeing an initial escalation of american involvement in the vietnam war he subsequently ended u
s
involvement in <year> and eliminated the draft
domestically his administration generally embraced policies that transferred power from washington to the states
among other things he initiated wars on cancer and drugs imposed wage and price controls enforced desegregation of southern schools and established the environmental protection agency
though he presided over apollo <num> and the subsequent lunar landings he later scaled back manned space exploration
in <year> he was reelected by a landslide the largest to that date
the watergate scandal which would consume the larger part of his second term resulted in his ultimate resignation on august <num> <year>
the final cyclone of the <year> – <num> australian region cyclone season herbie was first identified northwest of the cocos islands on <num> may
the following day the system was classified as a tropical low by the australian bureau of meteorology and intensified into a category <num> cyclone later that day
several hours after this upgrade the storm attained its initial peak intensity with winds of <num> km h <num> mph <num> @-@ minute sustained
around the same time the joint typhoon warning center classified herbie as tropical storm <num>
on <num> may the cyclone formed a new low pressure center and relocated roughly <num> km <num> mi south
shortly thereafter the storm began to accelerate towards the southeast and started to undergo an extratropical transition
early on <num> may herbie made landfall in shark bay before losing its identity the following day over the great australian bight
although a weak storm herbie brought flooding rains and severe dust storms to portions of western australia
additionally a <num> @,@ <num> ton freighter broke in half amidst rough seas produced by the storm
total losses from the storm reached a <num> million <num>
<num> million usd
due to the significant damage wrought by herbie the name was retired following its use
later that day the australian bureau of meteorology began monitoring the system as a tropical low
several hours after the joint typhoon warning center jtwc classified the system as tropical depression <num> having attained winds of <num> km h <num> mph <num> @-@ minute sustained
following slight development the system intensified into a category <num> cyclone and was given the name herbie by the australian bureau of meteorology early on <num> may
several hours after being named the storm attained its initial peak intensity with winds of <num> km h <num> mph <num> @-@ minute sustained and a barometric pressure of <num> hpa mbar
around the same time the jtwc upgraded the system to a tropical storm estimating the cyclone to have attained peak winds of <num> km h <num> mph <num> @-@ minute sustained
on <num> may satellite imagery of the system depicted that a new low pressure centre had developed roughly <num> km <num> mi south of the original low
several hours after the relocation the jtwc downgraded herbie to a tropical depression as the system 's movement began to accelerate towards the southeast
as the storm moved at a rapid speed towards the coastline of western australia it began to undergo an extratropical transition
during a <num> @-@ hour period <num> – <num> may herbie tracked roughly <num> @,@ <num> km <num> mi with the movement of the storm reaching <num> km h <num> mph at times
late on <num> may the jtwc ceased advisories on the system as it weakened below tropical depression status offshore
however the bureau of meteorology continued to monitor the system
early on <num> may the center of herbie made landfall in shark bay with wind gusts up to <num> km h <num> mph and a pressure of <num> hpa mbar
due to the rapid movement of the storm it reached the great australian bight while retaining tropical characteristics despite its low @-@ latitude
early on <num> may the system lost its identity south of australia as an extratropical cyclone
according to officials in the coastal town of denham
the cyclone struck virtually without warning
most tourists staying in the region evacuated the day before herbie 's arrival
herbie caused moderate structural damage across western australia in coastal areas between carnarvon and denham
banana plantations within this area also sustained extensive damage
in denham a storm surge of <num> m <num>
<num> ft broke the town 's retaining wall and flooded low @-@ lying areas along the shore
several fishing vessels were brought inland by the surge and left beached on streets once the water subsided
about <num> homes in denham lost their roofs after wind gusts estimated at <num> km h <num> mph battered the town
due to the storms extratropical transition areas south of herbie received moderate to heavy rainfall while areas north of the center reported severe dust storms fueled by the cyclone 's high winds
most areas affected by the storms rain recorded around <num> mm <num>
<num> in with isolated totals near <num> mm <num>
<num> in
the irwin and greenough rivers overflowed their banks inundating parts of dongara
in all the storm wrought approximately a <num> million worth of structural and agricultural damage in western australia
offshore a <num> @,@ <num> ton freighter the korean star sustained extreme damage during the storm
rough seas caused the hull of the ship to break and the vessel was separated into two pieces
although the freighter was in two pieces the ship did not sink and the wreckage of it came ashore near cape cuvier
no one on the ship sustained injury as all <num> crew members abandoned ship
the crew was rescued within a day of sustaining the damage and flown to carnarvon
in the wake of the storm the town hall in denham was converted into a temporary shelter for the homeless
repair to damaged roofs and downed power lines began on <num> may
within a few days of the storm 's passage appeals were made for relief funds in regions affected by herbie
as of january <year> cyclone herbie is the most recent tropical system to either directly or indirectly impact the town of geraldton a region that is struck by tropical cyclones once every six to eight years
although the storm caused relatively little damage the name herbie was retired following its usage and will never be used again to name a tropical cyclone in the australian region
with <num> percent turnout voters approved the referendum with <num> percent in favor of independence
subsequently croatia declared independence and the dissolution of its association with yugoslavia on <num> june <year> but it introduced a three @-@ month moratorium on the decision when urged to do so by the european community and the conference on security and cooperation in europe through the brioni agreement
the war in croatia escalated during the moratorium and on <num> october <year> the croatian parliament severed all remaining ties with yugoslavia
in <year> the countries of the european economic community granted croatia diplomatic recognition and croatia was admitted to the united nations
croatia was ruled by the communists and enjoyed a degree of autonomy within the yugoslav federation
in <year> a group of croatian authors and linguists published the declaration on the status and name of the croatian literary language demanding greater autonomy for the croatian language
the declaration contributed to a national movement seeking greater civil rights and decentralization of the yugoslav economy culminating in the croatian spring of <year> which was suppressed by yugoslav leadership
the <year> yugoslav constitution gave increased autonomy to federal units essentially fulfilling a goal of the croatian spring and providing a legal basis for independence of the federative constituents
in the <num> the political situation in yugoslavia deteriorated with national tension fanned by the <year> serbian sanu memorandum and the <year> coups in vojvodina kosovo and montenegro
in january <year> the communist party fragmented along national lines with the croatian faction demanding a looser federation
in the same year the first multi @-@ party elections were held in croatia with franjo tuđman 's win resulting in further nationalist tensions
the croatian serb politicians boycotted the sabor and local serbs seized control of serb @-@ inhabited territory setting up road blocks and voting for those areas to become autonomous
the serb autonomous oblasts would soon unite to become the internationally unrecognized republic of serbian krajina rsk intent on achieving independence from croatia
the decision was published in the official gazette of the republic of croatia and made official on <num> may <year>
the referendum offered two options
in the first croatia would become a sovereign and independent state guaranteeing cultural autonomy and civil rights to serbs and other minorities in croatia free to form an association of sovereign states with other former yugoslav republics
in the second croatia would remain in yugoslavia as a unified federal state
serb local authorities called for a boycott of the vote which was largely followed by croatian serbs
the referendum was held at <num> @,@ <num> polling stations where voters were given two ballots — blue and red with a single referendum option each allowing use of either or both of ballots
the referendum question proposing independence of croatia presented on the blue ballot passed with <num>

<num> of invalid or blank votes
the second referendum question proposing that croatia should remain in yugoslavia was declined with <num>

croatia subsequently declared independence and dissolved croatian razdruženje its association with yugoslavia on <num> june <year>
the european economic community and the conference on security and cooperation in europe urged croatian authorities to place a three @-@ month moratorium on the decision
croatia agreed to freeze its independence declaration for three months initially easing tensions
nonetheless the croatian war of independence escalated further
on <num> october the eve of expiration of the moratorium the yugoslav air force attacked banski dvori the main government building in zagreb
on <num> october <year> the moratorium expired and the croatian parliament severed all remaining ties with yugoslavia
that particular session of the parliament was held in the ina building on pavao šubić avenue in zagreb due to security concerns provoked by recent yugoslav air raid specifically it was feared that the yugoslav air force might attack the parliament building
<num> october is now celebrated as croatia 's independence day
in late <year> the commission stated among other things that yugoslavia was in the process of dissolution and that the internal boundaries of yugoslav republics could not be altered unless freely agreed upon
factors in the preservation of croatia 's pre @-@ war borders defined by demarcation commissions in <year> were the yugoslav federal constitutional amendments of <year> and <year> granting that sovereign rights were exercised by the federal units and that the federation had only the authority specifically transferred to it by the constitution
germany advocated quick recognition of croatia stating that it wanted to stop ongoing violence in serb @-@ inhabited areas
it was opposed by france the united kingdom and the netherlands but the countries agreed to pursue a common approach and avoid unilateral actions
on <num> october two days after the croatian parliament confirmed the declaration of independence the eec decided to postpone any decision to recognize croatia for two months deciding to recognize croatian independence in two months if the war had not ended by then
as the deadline expired germany presented its decision to recognize croatia as its policy and duty — a position supported by italy and denmark
france and the uk attempted to prevent the recognition by drafting a united nations resolution requesting no unilateral actions which could worsen the situation but backed down during the security council debate on <num> december when germany appeared determined to defy the un resolution
on <num> december the eec formally agreed to grant croatia diplomatic recognition on <num> january <year> relying on opinion of the badinter arbitration committee
the committee ruled that croatia 's independence should not be recognized immediately because the new croatian constitution did not provide protection of minorities required by the eec
in response the president franjo tuđman gave written assurances to robert badinter that the deficit would be remedied
the rsk formally declared its separation from croatia on <num> december but its statehood and independence were not recognized internationally
on <num> december yugoslav authorities announced plans for a smaller state which could include the territory captured from croatia but the plan was rejected by the un general assembly
croatia was first recognized as an independent state on <num> june <year> by slovenia which declared its own independence on the same day as croatia
lithuania followed on <num> july and ukraine latvia iceland and germany in december <year>
the eec countries granted croatia recognition on <num> january <year> and the united nations admitted them in may <year>
on the day 's <num> anniversary in <year> the croatian national bank minted a <num> kuna commemorative coin
in the period following the declaration of independence the war escalated with the sieges of vukovar and dubrovnik and fighting elsewhere until a ceasefire of <num> january <year> led to stabilization and a significant reduction of violence
the war effectively ended in august <year> with a decisive victory for croatia as a result of operation storm
present day borders of croatia were established when the remaining serb @-@ held areas of eastern slavonia were restored to croatia pursuant to the erdut agreement of november <year> with the process concluded in january <year>
although the systems differ in appearance all three are unicase their letters share the same names and alphabetical order and are written horizontally following the standard left @-@ to @-@ right direction
of the three georgian writing systems mkhedruli literally meaning cavalry or military script was the civilian royal script of the georgian kingdom used for charters historical documents manuscripts and inscriptions
mkhedruli is therefore the standard script for modern georgian and its related kartvelian languages whereas asomtavruli and nuskhuri are used only in ceremonial religious texts and iconography
georgian scripts are unique in their appearance and their exact origin has never been established however in strictly structural terms their alphabetical order largely corresponds to the greek alphabet with the exception of letters denoting uniquely georgian sounds which are grouped at the end
originally consisting of <num> letters georgian is presently written in a <num> @-@ letter alphabet as five letters are currently obsolete in that language
the number of georgian letters used in other kartvelian languages varies
the mingrelian language uses <num> <num> of which are current georgian letters one obsolete georgian letter and two additional letters specific to mingrelian and svan
that same obsolete letter plus a letter borrowed from greek making <num> letters total are used in writing the laz language
the fourth kartvelian language svan is not commonly written but when it is it uses georgian letters as utilized in mingrelian with an additional obsolete georgian letter and sometimes supplemented by diacritics for its many vowels
georgian scripts hold the national status of cultural heritage in georgia and are currently nominated for inclusion in the unesco 's list of the intangible cultural heritage of humanity
the first version of the script attested is asomtavruli which dates back to at least the <num> century the other scripts were formed in the following centuries
most scholars link the creation of the georgian alphabet to the process of christianisation of a core georgian @-@ speaking kingdom that is kartli or iberia in classical sources
the alphabet was therefore most probably created between the conversion of iberia under king mirian iii <num> or <num> and the bir el qutt inscriptions of <num> contemporaneously with the armenian alphabet
it was first used for translation of the bible and other christian literature into georgian by monks in georgia and palestine
professor levan chilashvili 's dating of fragmented asomtavruli inscriptions discovered by him at the ruined town of nekresi in georgia 's easternmost province of kakheti in the <num> to the 1st or <num> century has not been universally accepted
a georgian tradition first attested in the medieval chronicle lives of the kings of kartli ca
<num> assigns a much earlier pre @-@ christian origin to the georgian alphabet and names king pharnavaz i <num> century bc as its inventor
this account is now considered legendary and is rejected by scholarly consensus as no archaeological confirmation has been found
rapp considers the tradition to be an attempt by the georgian church to rebut the earlier tradition that the alphabet was invented by mesrop mashtots and is a georgian application of an iranian model in which primordial kings are credited with the creation of basic social institutions
georgian linguist tamaz gamkrelidze offers an alternate interpretation of the tradition in the pre @-@ christian use of foreign scripts alloglottography in the aramaic alphabet to write down georgian texts
a point of contention among scholars is the role played by armenian clerics in that process
according to a number of scholars and medieval armenian sources mesrop mashtots generally acknowledged as the creator of the armenian alphabet also created the georgian and caucasian albanian alphabets
this tradition originates in the works of koryun a fifth century historian and biographer of mashtots and has been quoted by donald rayfield and james r
russell but has been criticized by scholars both georgian and western who judge the passage in koryun unreliable or even a later interpolation
other scholars quote koryun 's claims without taking a stance on its validity
many agree however that armenian clerics if not mashtots himself must have played a role in the creation of the georgian script
another controversy regards the main influences at play in the georgian alphabet as scholars have debated whether it was inspired more by the greek alphabet or by semitic alphabets such as aramaic
recent historiography focuses on greater similarities with the greek alphabet than in the other caucasian writing systems most notably the order and numeric value of letters
some scholars have also suggested as a possible inspiration for particular letters certain pre @-@ christian georgian cultural symbols or clan markers
the name asomtavruli means capital letters from aso ასო letter and mtavari მთავარი principal head
it is also known as mrgvlovani georgian მრგვლოვანი rounded from mrgvali მრგვალი round so named because of its round letter shapes
despite its name this capital script is unicameral just like the modern georgian script mkhedruli
the oldest asomtavruli inscriptions found so far date from the <num> century and are bir el qutt and the bolnisi inscriptions
from the <num> century nuskhuri script starting becoming dominant and the role of asomtavruli was reduced
however epigraphic monuments of the <num> to <num> centuries continued to be written in asomtavruli script
asomtavruli in this later period became more decorative
in the majority of <num> @-@ century georgian manuscripts which were written in nuskhuri script asomtavruli was used for titles and the first letters of chapters
although some manuscripts written completely in asomtavruli can be found until the <num> century
georgian historian and philologist pavle ingorokva believes that the direction of asomtavruli like that of greek was initially boustrophedon though the direction of the earliest surviving texts is from left to the right
in most asomtavruli letters straight lines are horizontal or vertical and meet at right angles
the only letter with acute angles is ⴟ ჯ jani
there have been various attempts to explain this exception
georgian linguist and art historian helen machavariani believes jani derives from a monogram of christ composed of the ⴈ ი ini and ⴕ ქ kani
according to georgian scholar ramaz pataridze the cross @-@ like shape of letter jani indicates the end of the alphabet and has the same function as the similarly shaped phoenician letter taw greek chi χ and latin x though these letters do not have that function in phoenician greek or latin
coins of queen tamar of georgia and king george iv of georgia minted using asomtavruli script <num> – <num> ad
from the <num> century the forms of some letters began to change
the equal height of the letters was abandoned with letters acquiring ascenders and descenders
note some fonts show capitalized tall variants of nuskhuri and mkhedruli letters rather than asomtavruli
the latter were used at the beginnings of paragraphs which started new sections of text
in the early stages of the development of nuskhuri texts asomtavruli letters were not elaborate and were distinguished principally by size and sometimes by being written in cinnabar ink
later from the <num> century the letters were illuminated
the style of asomtavruli capitals can be used to identify the era of a text
for example in the georgian manuscripts of the byzantine era when the styles of the byzantine empire influenced kingdom of georgia capitals were illuminated with images of birds and other animals
decorative asomtavruli capital letters მ m ნ n and თ t <num> – <num> century
from the <num> @-@ century limb @-@ flowery limb @-@ arrowy and limb @-@ spotty decorative forms of asomtavruli are developed
the first two are found in <num> and <num> @-@ century monuments whereas the third one is used until the <num> century
importance was attached also to the colour of the ink itself
asomtavruli letter დ doni is often written with decoration effects of fish and birds
the curly decorative form of asomtavruli is also used where the letters are wattled or intermingled on each other or the smaller letters are written inside other letters
it was mostly used for the headlines of the manuscripts or the books although there are compete inscriptions which were written in the asomtavruli curly form only
the title of gospel of matthew in asomtavruli curly decorative form
the name nuskhuri comes from nuskha ნუსხა meaning inventory or schedule
nuskhuri was soon augmented with asomtavruli illuminated capitals in religious manuscripts
the combination is called khutsuri georgian ხუცური clerical from khutsesi ხუცესი cleric and it was principally used in hagiography
nuskhuri first appeared in the <num> century as a graphic variant of asomtavruli
the oldest inscription is found in the ateni sioni church and dates to <num> ad
the oldest surviving nuskhuri manuscripts date to <num> ad
nuskhuri becomes dominant over asomtavruli from the <num> century
letters have an angular shape with a noticeable tendency to simplify the shapes they had in asomtavruli
this enabled faster writing of manuscripts
→ → asomtavruli letters ო oni and ჳ vie
a ligature of these letters produced a new letter in nuskhuri უ uni
note without proper font support you may see question marks boxes or other symbols instead of nuskhuri letters
georgian linguist akaki shanidze made an attempt in the <num> to introduce asomtavruli into the mkhedruli script as capital letters to begin sentences as in the latin script but it didn 't catch on
asomtavruli and nuskhuri are officially used by the georgian orthodox church alongside mkhedruli
patriarch ilia ii of georgia called on people to use all three georgian scripts
mkhedruli literally meaning cavalry or military derives from mkhedari მხედარი meaning horseman knight warrior and cavalier
like the two other scripts mkhedruli is purely unicameral
mkhedruli first appears in the <num> century
the oldest mkhedruli inscription is found in ateni sioni church dating back to <num> ad
the second oldest mkhedruli @-@ written text is found in the <num> @-@ century royal charters of king bagrat iv of georgia
mkhedruli was mostly used then in the kingdom of georgia for the royal charters historical documents manuscripts and inscriptions
mkhedruli was used for non @-@ religious purposes only and represented the civil royal and secular script
mkhedruli became more and more dominant over the two other scripts though khutsuri nuskhuri with asomtavruli was used until the <num> century
since the <num> century with the establishment and development of the printed georgian fonts mkhedruli became universal writing georgian outside the church
mkhedruli letters are written in the four @-@ linear system similar to nuskhuri
mkhedruli becomes more round and free in writing
it breaks the strict frame of the previous two alphabets asomtavruli and nuskhuri
mkhedruli letters begin to get coupled and more free calligraphy develops

ჲ hie also called iota appeared instead of ი ini after a vowel but came to have the same pronunciation as ი ini and was replaced by it
thus ქრისტჱ ქრისტეჲ krist 'ey christ is now written ქრისტეი krist 'ei
ჳ vie came to be pronounced the same as ვი vi and was replaced by that sequence as in სხჳსი სხვისი skhvisi others

several others were used for abkhaz and ossetian in the short time they were written in mkhedruli script
some of these alphabets retained letters obsolete in georgian while others required additional letters ჶ fi phi is used in laz and svan and formerly in ossetian and abkhazian
it derives from the greek letter φ phi
ჷ shva schwa also called yn is used for the schwa sound in svan and mingrelian and formerly in ossetian and abkhazian
ჸ elifi alif is used in for the glottal stop in svan and mingrelian
it is a reversed 〈 ყ 〉 q 'ari
ჹ turned gani was once used for ɢ in evangelical literature in dagestanian languages
ჺ aini ain is occasionally used for ʕ in bats

only four letters are x @-@ height with neither ascenders nor descenders ა თ ი ო
thirteen have ascenders like b or d in english ბ ზ მ ნ პ რ ს შ ჩ ძ წ ხ ჰ an equal number have descenders like p or q in english გ დ ე ვ კ ლ ჟ ტ უ ფ ღ ყ ც three letters have both ascenders and descenders like þ in old english ქ ჭ and in handwriting ჯ
წ has both ascender and descender in print and sometimes in handwriting
for example the top circle of ზ zeni and the top stroke of რ rae may go in the other direction than shown in the chart that is counter @-@ clockwise starting at <num> o 'clock and upwards – see the external @-@ link section for videos of people writing
other common variants გ gani may be written like ვ vini with a closed loop at the bottom
დ doni is frequently written with a simple loop at top
კ ც and ძ k 'ani tsani dzili are generally written with straight vertical lines at the top so that for example ც tsani resembles a u with a dimple in the right side
ლ lasi is frequently written with a single arc
even when all three are written they 're generally not all the same size as they are in print but rather riding on one wide arc like two dimples in it
rarely ო oni is written as a right angle
რ rae is frequently written with one arc like a latin 〈 h 〉
ტ t 'ari often has a small circle with a tail hanging into the bowl rather than two small circles as in print or as an o with a straight vertical line intersecting the top
it may also be rotated a bit clockwise with the small circles further to the right and not as close to the top
წ ts 'ili is generally written with a round bowl at the bottom
another variation features a triangular bowl
ჭ ch 'ari may be written without the hook at the top and often with a completely straight vertical line
ჱ he may be written without the loop like a conflation of ს and ჰ
for ვ vini and კ k 'ani the critical difference is whether the top is a full arc or a more @-@ or @-@ less vertical line
for ვ vini and გ gani it is whether the bottom is an open curve or closed a loop
the same is true of უ uni and შ shini in handwriting the tops may look the same
similarly ს sani and ხ khani
for კ k 'ani and პ p 'ari the crucial difference is whether the letter is written below or above x @-@ height and whether it 's written top @-@ down or bottom @-@ up
ძ dzili is written with a vertical top
a ligature of the asomtavruli initials of king vakhtang i of iberia ⴂ ⴌ გნ gn a ligature of the asomtavruli letters ⴃ ⴀ და da and nuskhuri like asomtavruli is also often highly stylized
writers readily formed ligatures and abbreviations for nomina sacra including diacritics called karagma which resemble titla
because writing materials such as vellum were scarce and therefore precious abbreviating was a practical measure widespread in manuscripts and hagiography by the <num> century
a nuskhuri abbreviation of რომელი romeli which a nuskhuri abbreviation of იესუ ქრისტე iesu kriste jesus christ mkhedruli in the <num> to <num> centuries also came to employ digraphs to the point that they were obligatory requiring adhesion to a complex system
traditionally asomtavruli was used for chapter or section titles where latin script might use bold or italic type
in the <num> century clusters of one · two three ჻ and six ჻ ჻ dots later sometimes small circles were introduced by ephrem mtsire to indicate increasing breaks in the text
one dot indicated a minor stop presumably a simple word break two dots marked or separated special words three dots for a bigger stop such as the appositive name and title the sovereign alexander below or the title of the gospel of matthew above and six dots were to indicate the end of the sentence
starting in the <num> century marks resembling the apostrophe and comma came into use
an apostrophe was used to mark an interrogative word and a comma appeared at the end of an interrogative sentence
from the <num> century on these were replaced with the semicolon the greek question mark
in the <num> century patriarch anton i of georgia reformed the system again with commas single dots and double dots used to mark complete incomplete and final sentences respectively

khandoba is portrayed as a king of jejuri where his chief temple stands
some traditions do not give her the status of a legal wife and treat her as a concubine of khandoba
while scriptures related to khandoba do not mention banai she is a central subject of folk songs
banai is considered as a dhangar a sheep herding caste and is sometimes regarded to be of celestial origin
oral traditions chiefly discuss the tale of her marriage to khandoba and her conflicts with his first wife mhalsa
banai is an antithesis of mhalsa together they complete the god
banai is generally depicted with khandoba and often is also accompanied by mhalsa
banai does not enjoy independent worship but is worshipped as khandoba 's consort in most of his temples
she is the patron goddess of the dhangar community and is worshipped as a protector of their herds
the tale of the king or god with two wives is retold with some variation across india murugan and his wives devasena and valli venkateswara lakshmi and padmavati being some examples
the motif of shiva and his wives parvati and ganga is told in the puranas
the theme of the god marrying a tribal girl like banai recurs across the deccan region another example being valli 's marriage to murugan
deities across the deccan even extending to kerala and tamil nadu often have two wives one wife from a high caste and another from the lower social strata a lower caste or a tribal
khandoba 's wives who come from various communities establish cultural linkages of the god to these communities who worship them as their patron god
while banai is considered as a legal wife of khandoba in maharashtra especially with the dhangars the kurubas of karnataka regard her as a concubine
while mhalsa is from the high @-@ caste lingayat merchant vani community banai is described as a dhangar shepherd caste representing the outside and associates khandoba with non @-@ elite herding castes like dhangars gavli and kuruba gowda who live in the forest
some traditions consider banai as a gavli cowherd caste or koli fisherman caste
in karnataka she is called kurbattyavva and is a kuruba
banai is an antithesis mhalsa
mhalsa has a regular ritualistic marriage with khandoba
banai on the other hand has a love marriage after being captured by the god
mhalsa is described as pure ugly jealous and a good cook banai is impure erotic resolute but does not even know to cook
mhalsa represents culture while banai nature together they aid the god @-@ king khandoba
the oral legends and texts initiate a process of sanskritization of the folk deity khandoba by elevating him to the classical hindu god shiva his two principal wives mhalsa and banai are equated to parvati and ganga
banai does not appear in the sanskrit malhari mahatmya the main scripture related to khandoba however it mentions ganga arriving from heaven
banai ganga has a quarrel with mhalsa parvati ultimately ending with the message that both are the same
some dhangars consider banai also to be a form of parvati
the chief source of legends related to banai are ovi pada or folk songs sung by vaghyas and muralis the male and female bards of khandoba
they sing at jagrans a vigil where the bards sing in praise of khandoba through the night
the songs talk about the relationship of khandoba to his consorts and the mutual relationships of the wives
they are centred on mhalsa and banai and often narrate about their quarrels
the tale of the marriage of khandoba and banai is a central theme in many dhangar folk songs
the varkari saint sheikh muhammad <year> @-@ <year> disparages khandoba in his yoga @-@ samgrama and calls him the mad god that searches for banai due to sexual passion an allusion to the tale of banai 's marriage indicating that the tale was well @-@ established by this era
according to scholar günther @-@ dietz sontheimer the legend of banai has close parallels with the story of king dushyanta and shakuntala from the hindu epic mahabharata
the tale of another folk god mhaskoba bhairava to gain his wife balurani or balai despite obstacles is also similar to khandoba 's endeavour to win over banai
in contrast banai occupies the central position in the dhangar folk narrative and mhalsa 's marriage to khandoba is reduced to a passing mention marathas and other settled castes give more importance to mhalsa
few regard her as an avatar of the apsara celestial nymph rambha while others consider her as one of the seven daughters of indra the king of the gods
she is found by a dhangar in a golden box in the forest hidden in a termite mound or a pit
her dhangar father sometimes named yamu is the chief of shepherds who owns nine lakh sheep and goats nine lakh lambs and numerous barren ones
yamu is said to have prayed for a child and finds banai in a box
a virgin ewe is said to have fed banai her milk as yamu does not have a wife and does not know how to feed the infant
in another miracle a three @-@ storeyed house appears at the place of yamu 's tent for the young banai to reside while the rest of the dhangars live in tents
she grows up as a rich shepherdess and becomes the overseer of twelve dhangar vadas pastoral settlements or camps inhabited by different dhangar clans
she cares for her sheep grazes them and learns how to breed them
khandoba loses everything to mhalsa in the wager except his dhoti his flag his staff wand and his bhandari the bag of magical bhandara turmeric powder
in a dream he sees banai and falls in love with her
he goes on a hunt in the forest gets away from the army and stays with banai for twelve years
he marries her in non @-@ ritualistic marriage and brings her back to jejuri
a variant describes how khandoba arrives in chandanpur on a hunting expedition and becomes thirsty
a dhangar directs him to banai 's vada
banai offers him water or sends a pot of water in which khandoba reads banai 's name
in another version the pot with nine jewels is a sign for khandoba to recognise banai the girl he saw in his dream
he falls for her and loses purposefully in saripat with mhalsa and accepts a twelve @-@ year exile
in this period he disguises himself as an impoverished old leper and becomes a man @-@ servant of banai 's father
some folk songs have erotic overtones for example some songs give erotic descriptions of banai 's beauty which maddens khandoba
khandoba is described as doing odd jobs under banai 's orders
banai first assigns him the task of sweeping the entire vada
he is responsible for cleaning the sheep pens and taking the sheep and lambs for grazing
he completes all tasks by spreading his magical bhandara
the shepherds are astonished how a single old man can handle all the animals
their vanity is crushed
banai assigns him the additional responsibility of taking care of five hundred children
she commands if any sheep or lamb is lost or a child cries she will not give him his food
but khandoba fulfils the tasks again by spraying his bhandara
she assigns him the job of washing the sheep and lambs
instead khandoba kills all her sheep and lambs to humble the shepherds and banai
he skins the sheep and separates the meat
a repentant banai begs his forgiveness he agrees to revive her flock on the condition that banai marries him
khandoba revives the sheep by spreading his bhandara and reveals his true form
the wedding is deemed not in accordance to hindu rituals
banai and khandoba marry in a simple un @-@ brahmanical ceremony where sheep droppings are showered on the couple instead of rice as in the ritualistic weddings of classical brahmanical hinduism
the wedding is conducted without a brahmin officiating priest
shepherds read the mantras the responsibility of the brahmin in a normal wedding and the bleating of sheep replaces the traditional wedding band
the wedding is sometimes described as a gandharva marriage
due to the unceremonious nature of the wedding she is sometimes considered as a rakh concubine of khandoba
many songs tell about the confrontations of mhalsa and banai
in some songs mhalsa complains about khandoba 's infatuation with the impure banai
the cantankerous mhalsa grumbles how banai has polluted the house by her uncouth ways and suggests that banai should be returned to the wilderness again
the songs sing how the vegetarian high @-@ caste mhalsa is forced to catch fish and eat in the same plate as the non @-@ vegetarian low @-@ caste banai
mhalsa is portrayed blaming banai for the problems in the palace and talking about her superiority to banai
banai retorts by saying that khandoba came to her mesmerized by her beauty and became her servant
a frustrated khandoba leaves the palace on a hunting trip after mhalsa and banai quarrel about who will embroider a shawl for him and marries rambhai
the songs also narrate how ultimately the wives have to remain in harmony and aid each other
for example a song sings how mhalsa and banai come together and celebrate the festival of diwali with khandoba at jejuri
rarely banai also appears in khandoba 's chief legend where he slays the demons mani and malla
mhalsa and banai or ganga futilely help khandoba in the battle to collect the blood of mani every drop of which was creating a new demon
finally the dog of khandoba swallows all the blood
rarely banai is described as seated behind khandoba on the horse and fighting with a sword or spear a role generally assigned to mhalsa
she is generally worshipped as khandoba 's consort
while in karnataka her temple is outside the village and mailara as khandoba is known in karnataka journeys every year to visit it for ten nights from his temple in the village
in maharashtra banai 's temple is inside the village but outside the chief temple as in khandoba 's chief temple at jejuri
mhalsa who is installed in the main temple is said to resist the arrival of khandoba 's new wife banai and thus banai does not reside in the chief temple
frustrated by the constant quarrels between the two wives khandoba is said to have divided the hill of jejuri into two halves the lower half belongs to banai where she has a separate shrine while mhalsa rules the upper half where she stays with khandoba in the main temple
it is customary to pay respects to banai on the way up to the main shrine before worshipping khandoba and mhalsa there
it is said that khandoba bestowed the honour of first worship on banai while sending her off to a separate residence
banai is the patron goddess of the dhangars and the protector goddess of flock and herds
she takes care of the well @-@ being of the community and is worshipped for increasing the herd
stone votive images of sheep and other cattle are offered to her for plentiful animals
no animal sacrifice or non @-@ vegetarian offerings are presented to khandoba directly instead non @-@ vegetarian offerings intended for khandoba are offered to banai
dhangars sacrifice rams in her honour and offer her a naivedya food offering of liver meat and rice especially on the holy days vijayadashami when warriors traditionally set off on war or on a journey and the full moon days in the hindu months of magha and chaitra
khandoba is often depicted with two identical goddesses accompanying him representing mhalsa and banai
in brass images banai is depicted holding a lamb and offering water to khandoba while mhalsa rides with khandoba on his horse
in metal plaques worshipped by the dhangars banai accompanies khandoba on his horse and is depicted with sheep
it was isolated in <year> and is named after the continent of europe
it is a moderately hard silvery metal which readily oxidizes in air and water
being a typical member of the lanthanide series europium usually assumes the oxidation state <num> but the oxidation state <num> is also common all europium compounds with oxidation state <num> are slightly reducing
europium has no significant biological role and is relatively non @-@ toxic compared to other heavy metals
most applications of europium exploit the phosphorescence of europium compounds
europium is one of the least abundant elements in the universe only about <num> × <num> − <num> of all matter in the universe is europium
it crystallizes in a body @-@ centered cubic lattice
some properties of europium are strongly influenced by its half @-@ filled electron shell
europium has the second lowest melting point and the lowest density of all lanthanides
europium becomes a superconductor when it is cooled below <num>
<num> k and compressed to above <num> gpa
this is because europium is divalent in the metallic state and is converted into the trivalent state by the applied pressure
it rapidly oxidizes in air so that bulk oxidation of a centimeter @-@ sized sample occurs within several days
its reactivity with water is comparable to that of calcium and the reaction is <num> eu <num> h2o → <num> eu oh <num> <num> h2 because of the high reactivity samples of solid europium rarely have the shiny appearance of the fresh metal even when coated with a protective layer of mineral oil
this behavior is unusual to most lanthanides which almost exclusively form compounds with an oxidation state of <num>
the <num> state has an electron configuration 4f7 because the half @-@ filled f @-@ shell gives more stability
the <num> state is highly reducing
in terms of size and coordination number europium ii and barium ii are similar
for example the sulfates of both barium and europium ii are also highly insoluble in water
divalent europium is a mild reducing agent oxidizing in air to form eu iii compounds
in anaerobic and particularly geothermal conditions the divalent form is sufficiently stable that it tends to be incorporated into minerals of calcium and the other alkaline earths
this ion @-@ exchange process is the basis of the negative europium anomaly the low europium content in many lanthanide minerals such as monazite relative to the chondritic abundance
bastnäsite tends to show less of a negative europium anomaly than does monazite and hence is the major source of europium today
the development of easy methods to separate divalent europium from the other trivalent lanthanides made europium accessible even when present in low concentration as it usually is
<num> natural abundance
while 153eu is stable 151eu was recently found to be unstable to alpha decay with half @-@ life of <num> <num> − <num> × <num> years giving about <num> alpha decay per two minutes in every kilogram of natural europium
this value is in reasonable agreement with theoretical predictions
besides the natural radioisotope 151eu <num> artificial radioisotopes have been characterized the most stable being 150eu with a half @-@ life of <num>
<num> years 152eu with a half @-@ life of <num>
<num> years and 154eu with a half @-@ life of <num>
<num> years
all the remaining radioactive isotopes have half @-@ lives shorter than <num>
<num> years and the majority of these have half @-@ lives shorter than <num>
<num> seconds
this element also has <num> meta states with the most stable being 150meu t1 <num> <num>
<num> hours 152m1eu t1 <num> <num>
<num> hours and 152m2eu t1 <num> <num> minutes
the primary decay mode for isotopes lighter than 153eu is electron capture and the primary mode for heavier isotopes is beta minus decay
the primary decay products before 153eu are isotopes of samarium sm and the primary products after are isotopes of gadolinium gd
like other lanthanides many isotopes especially isotopes with odd mass numbers and neutron @-@ poor isotopes like 152eu have high cross sections for neutron capture often high enough to be neutron poisons
151eu is the beta decay product of samarium @-@ <num> but since this has a long decay half @-@ life and short mean time to neutron absorption most <num> instead ends up as <num>
152eu half @-@ life <num>
<num> years and 154eu half @-@ life <num>
<num> years cannot be beta decay products because <num> and <num> are non @-@ radioactive but 154eu is the only long @-@ lived shielded nuclide other than 134cs to have a fission yield of more than <num>
<num> parts per million fissions
a larger amount of 154eu is produced by neutron activation of a significant portion of the non @-@ radioactive 153eu however much of this is further converted to 155eu
155eu half @-@ life <num>
<num> years has a fission yield of <num> parts per million ppm for uranium @-@ <num> and thermal neutrons most of it is transmuted to non @-@ radioactive and nonabsorptive gadolinium @-@ <num> by the end of fuel burnup
overall europium is overshadowed by caesium @-@ <num> and strontium @-@ <num> as a radiation hazard and by samarium and others as a neutron poison
many minerals contain europium with the most important sources being bastnäsite monazite xenotime and loparite
depletion or enrichment of europium in minerals relative to other rare earth elements is known as the europium anomaly
europium is commonly included in trace element studies in geochemistry and petrology to understand the processes that form igneous rocks rocks that cooled from magma or lava
the nature of the europium anomaly found helps reconstruct the relationships within a suite of igneous rocks
divalent europium eu2 in small amounts is the activator of the bright blue fluorescence of some samples of the mineral fluorite caf2
the reduction from eu3 to eu2 is induced by irradiation with energetic particles
the most outstanding examples of this originated around weardale and adjacent parts of northern england it was the fluorite found here that fluorescence was named after in <year> although it was not until much later that europium was determined to be the cause
separation of the rare earth elements is a step in the later processing
rare earth elements are found in the minerals bastnäsite loparite xenotime and monazite in mineable quantities
the first two are orthophosphate minerals lnpo <num> ln denotes a mixture of all the lanthanides except promethium and the third is a fluorocarbonate lnco3f
monazite also contains thorium and yttrium which complicates handling because thorium and its decay products are radioactive
for the extraction from the ore and the isolation of individual lanthanides several methods have been developed
the choice of method is based on the concentration and composition of the ore and on the distribution of the individual lanthanides in the resulting concentrate
roasting the ore and subsequent acidic and basic leaching is used mostly to produce a concentrate of lanthanides
if cerium is the dominant lanthanide then it is converted from cerium iii to cerium iv and then precipitated
further separation by solvent extractions or ion exchange chromatography yields a fraction which is enriched in europium
this fraction is reduced with zinc zinc amalgam electrolysis or other methods converting the europium iii to europium ii
europium ii reacts in a way similar to that of alkaline earth metals and therefore it can be precipitated as carbonate or is co @-@ precipitated with barium sulfate
europium metal is available through the electrolysis of a mixture of molten eucl3 and nacl or cacl2 in a graphite cell which serves as cathode using graphite as anode
the other product is chlorine gas
a few large deposits produce or produced a significant amount of the world production
the bayan obo iron ore deposit contains significant amounts of bastnäsite and monazite and is with an estimated <num> million tonnes of rare earth element oxides the largest known deposit
the mining operations at the bayan obo deposit made china the largest supplier of rare earth elements in the <num>
only <num>
<num> of the rare earth element content is europium
the second large source for rare earth elements between <year> and its closure in the late <num> was the mountain pass rare earth mine
the bastnäsite mined there is especially rich in the light rare earth elements la @-@ gd sc and y and contains only <num>
<num> of europium
another large source for rare earth elements is the loparite found on the kola peninsula
it contains besides niobium tantalum and titanium up to <num> rare earth elements and is the largest source for these elements in russia
commonly these compounds feature eu iii bound by <num> – <num> oxygenic ligands typically water
these compounds the chlorides sulfates nitrates are soluble in water or polar organic solvent
lipophilic europium complexes often feature acetylacetonate @-@ like ligands e
g
eufod
europium also forms the corresponding dihalides yellow @-@ green europium ii fluoride euf2 colorless europium ii chloride eucl2 colorless europium ii bromide eubr2 and green europium ii iodide eui2
three oxides are known europium ii oxide euo europium iii oxide eu2o3 and the mixed @-@ valence oxide eu3o4 consisting of both eu ii and eu iii
otherwise the main chalcogenides are europium ii sulfide eus europium ii selenide euse and europium ii telluride eute all three of these are black solids
eus is prepared by sulfiding the oxide at temperatures sufficiently high to decompose the eu2o3 eu2o3 <num> h2s → <num> eus <num> h2o s the main nitride is europium iii nitride eun
william crookes observed the phosphorescent spectra of the rare elements and observed spectral lines later assigned to europium
europium was first found in <year> by paul émile lecoq de boisbaudran who obtained basic fractions from samarium @-@ gadolinium concentrates which had spectral lines not accounted for by samarium or gadolinium
however the discovery of europium is generally credited to french chemist eugène @-@ anatole demarçay who suspected samples of the recently discovered element samarium were contaminated with an unknown element in <year> and who was able to isolate it in <year> he then named it europium
when the europium @-@ doped yttrium orthovanadate red phosphor was discovered in the early <num> and understood to be about to cause a revolution in the color television industry there was a scramble for the limited supply of europium on hand among the monazite processors as the typical europium content in monazite is about <num>
<num>
however the molycorp bastnäsite deposit at the mountain pass rare earth mine california whose lanthanides had an unusually high europium content of <num>
<num> was about to come on @-@ line and provide sufficient europium to sustain the industry
prior to europium the color @-@ tv red phosphor was very weak and the other phosphor colors had to be muted to maintain color balance
with the brilliant red europium phosphor it was no longer necessary to mute the other colors and a much brighter color tv picture was the result
europium has continued to be in use in the tv industry ever since as well as in computer monitors
californian bastnäsite now faces stiff competition from bayan obo china with an even richer europium content of <num>
<num>
frank spedding celebrated for his development of the ion @-@ exchange technology that revolutionized the rare earth industry in the mid @-@ <num> once related the story of how he was lecturing on the rare earths in the <num> when an elderly gentleman approached him with an offer of a gift of several pounds of europium oxide
this was an unheard @-@ of quantity at the time and spedding did not take the man seriously
however a package duly arrived in the mail containing several pounds of genuine europium oxide
the elderly gentleman had turned out to be herbert newby mccoy who had developed a famous method of europium purification involving redox chemistry
almost invariably they exploit its phosphorescence either in the <num> or <num> oxidation state
it is a dopant in some types of glass in lasers and other optoelectronic devices
europium oxide eu2o3 is widely used as a red phosphor in television sets and fluorescent lamps and as an activator for yttrium @-@ based phosphors
color tv screens contain between <num>
<num> and <num> g of europium oxide
whereas trivalent europium gives red phosphors the luminescence of divalent europium depends on the host lattice but tends to be on the blue side
the two classes of europium @-@ based phosphor red and blue combined with the yellow green terbium phosphors give white light the color temperature of which can be varied by altering the proportion or specific composition of the individual phosphors
this phosphor system is typically encountered in helical fluorescent light bulbs
combining the same three classes is one way to make trichromatic systems in tv and computer screens
europium is also used in the manufacture of fluorescent glass
one of the more common persistent after @-@ glow phosphors besides copper @-@ doped zinc sulfide is europium @-@ doped strontium aluminate
europium fluorescence is used to interrogate biomolecular interactions in drug @-@ discovery screens
it is also used in the anti @-@ counterfeiting phosphors in euro banknotes
an application that has almost fallen out of use with the introduction of affordable superconducting magnets is the use of europium complexes such as eu fod <num> as shift reagents in nmr spectroscopy
chiral shift reagents such as eu hfc <num> are still used to determine enantiomeric purity
a recent <year> application of europium is in quantum memory chips which can reliably store information for days at a time these could allow sensitive quantum data to be stored to a hard disk @-@ like device and shipped around the country
europium chloride nitrate and oxide have been tested for toxicity europium chloride shows an acute intraperitoneal ld50 toxicity of <num> mg kg and the acute oral ld50 toxicity is <num> mg kg
europium nitrate shows a slightly higher intraperitoneal ld50 toxicity of <num> mg kg while the oral toxicity is above <num> mg kg
the metal dust presents a fire and explosion hazard
for most of its existence it covered central and northern queensland and papua new guinea
it was formed in january <year> from the eastern part of the former northern area command which had covered the whole of northern australia and papua
headquartered at townsville queensland north @-@ eastern area command was primarily responsible for air defence aerial reconnaissance and protection of the sea lanes within its boundaries
aircraft under its control took part in the battles of rabaul port moresby and milne bay in <year> and the landings at hollandia and aitape in <year>
the command continued to operate following the end of the war before its responsibilities were subsumed in <year> by the raaf 's new functional command @-@ and @-@ control system the headquarters was disbanded two years later
northern area had been established on <num> may <year> as one of the raaf 's geographically based command @-@ and @-@ control zones and covered northern new south wales queensland the northern territory and papua
the roles of the area commands were air defence protection of adjacent sea lanes and aerial reconnaissance
each area was led by an air officer commanding aoc responsible for the administration and operations of air bases and units within his boundary
the outbreak of the pacific war in december <year> was the catalyst for northern area being split into north @-@ western area nwa and north @-@ eastern area nea to counter distinct threats to northern australia and new guinea respectively
air commodore frank lukis formerly in charge of northern area was nea 's inaugural aoc taking responsibility for raaf operations against the japanese in new guinea new britain and surrounding islands
his headquarters staff numbered <num>
on <num> january <year> a force of over <num> japanese aircraft attacked rabaul destroying or badly damaging six cac wirraways and killing or wounding eleven crewmen of no
<num> squadron under wing commander john lerew
the following day nea headquarters sent a signal to lerew ordering him to keep his airfield open to which lerew with only two wirraways left replied using the legendary ancient gladiatorial phrase to honour an emperor morituri vos salutamus we who are about to die salute you
ignoring a further message from headquarters to abandon his squadron and escape in a lockheed hudson bomber on <num> january lerew began evacuating staff to port moresby new guinea
no
<num> squadron operating ex @-@ qantas short empire flying boats and several smaller transports was raised in nea on <num> february <year>
earlier that month lukis warned higher command of the poor state of preparedness and low morale of australian army troops at port moresby due to lack of air cover and apparent lack of interest from government echelons
on <num> february nos
<num> and <num> fighter sector headquarters were established to coordinate fighter operations they were based at townsville and port moresby respectively
seventeen p @-@ <num> kittyhawks of no
<num> squadron recently formed at townsville were deployed to port moresby in mid @-@ march
commanded by squadron leader john jackson the squadron suffered heavy losses in the ensuing battle
at one point nea headquarters gave jackson permission to withdraw but he refused and the squadron was eventually credited with destroying thirty @-@ five japanese aircraft in the air and on the ground securing port moresby until relieved by the <num> and <num> squadrons of the united states army air forces usaaf operating p @-@ <num> airacobras
several usaaf bomber formations operated under nea 's control in early <year> including a @-@ <num> banshees of the <num> squadron from port moresby and b @-@ <num> flying fortresses of the <num> squadron initially known as the kangaroo squadron from townsville
as of <num> april operational authority over all raaf combat infrastructure including area commands was invested in the newly established allied air forces aaf headquarters under south west pacific area command swpa
one result of this was the integration of usaaf and raaf staff at area headquarters
according to the official history of the raaf though more a diplomatic gesture than a practical method of war organisation it gave personnel from the two services the opportunity to quickly become acclimatised to each other and in north @-@ eastern area as an example the atmosphere was happy and the staff extremely cooperative
following the battle of the coral sea in may usaaf units no longer operated under raaf control in the nea but were commanded directly by senior american officers of the aaf
nea 's operational headquarters a reinforced concrete bunker known as building <num> was completed in may <year>
located on green street townsville at the base of castle hill it was topped with a suburban house to mislead enemy aircraft
the same month eastern area command was formed taking control of units in new south wales and southern queensland from southern area and nea
this left nea in command of nos

no
<num> squadron replenished after its defence of port moresby and no
<num> squadron deployed north from townsville and also flying kittyhawks played what senior australian army commanders described as the decisive role in the battle of milne bay in new guinea during august and september <year>
during the battle cobby exercised overall command of the raaf units from nea headquarters while their efforts were coordinated on the ground by group captain bill garing nea 's senior air staff officer
on <num> september <year> no
<num> operational group was formed at port moresby as a mobile strike force to move forward with allied advances in the pacific in contrast to the static defensive nature of the area commands
it took over all units in new guinea previously operating under nea command
nea initially retained administrative control of no
<num> group but on <num> january <year> the group was made independent of the area command and its administration became the responsibility of raaf headquarters melbourne
september <year> also saw the formation of raaf command led by air vice marshal bill bostock to oversee the majority of australian flying units in the swpa
bostock exercised control of air operations through the area commands although raaf headquarters continued to hold overarching administrative authority over all australian units
he personally coordinated operations when they involved more than one area command for instance when the fighter squadrons of both nwa and nea were required to repulse a major attack

by the end of the month nea headquarters staff numbered <num> including ninety @-@ eight officers
the air force shrank dramatically as personnel were demobilised and units disbanded most of the raaf 's bases and aircraft employed in operations after the war were situated within eastern area 's sphere of control in new south wales and southern queensland
in september <year> the chief of the air staff air vice marshal george jones proposed reducing the five extant mainland area commands north @-@ western north @-@ eastern eastern southern and western areas to three northern area covering queensland and the northern territory eastern area covering new south wales and southern area covering western australia south australia victoria and tasmania
the australian government rejected the plan and the wartime area command boundaries essentially remained in place
by <year> nea headquarters was located in sturt street townsville
no

air commodore ian mclachlan was appointed aoc nea in september <year> and served two years in the post before handing over to acting air commodore patrick heffernan
commencing in october <year> the raaf was reorganised from a geographically based command @-@ and @-@ control system into one based on function
in february <year> the newly constituted functional organisations — home training and maintenance commands — assumed control of all operations training and maintenance from north @-@ eastern area command
nea headquarters remained in existence but only as one of home command 's remote control points

only a few dozen specimens are known mostly regurgitated by reef @-@ dwelling fish
it lives in rocky reefs and is thought to lay large eggs that have a short larval phase or that hatch directly as a juvenile
the species grows to a total length of <num> cm <num>
<num> in and resembles a small european or american lobster it was previously included in the same genus homarus although it is not very closely related to those species and is now considered to form a separate monotypic genus – homarinus
its closest relatives are the genera thymops and thymopides
it occurs from dassen island western cape in the west to haga haga eastern cape in the east a range of <num> kilometres <num> mi
most of the known specimens were regurgitated by fish caught on reefs at depths of <num> – <num> metres <num> – <num> ft
this suggests that the cape lobster inhabits rocky substrates and may explain its apparent rarity since such areas are not amenable to dredging or trawling and the species may be too small to be retained by lobster traps
<num> – <num>
<num> in total length or <num> – <num> cm <num>
<num> – <num>
<num> in carapace length
accounts of the colouration of h
capensis are very variable from tawny red or yellow to a rather dark olive similar to homarus gammarus
homarinus and homarus are considered to be the most plesiomorphic genera in the family nephropidae
nonetheless the cape lobster differs from homarus in a number of characters
the rostrum of the cape lobster is flattened while that of homarus is rounded in section and curves upwards at the tip
the three pairs of claws are covered with hairs in homarinus while those of homarus are hairless
the telson tapers along its length in homarus but has sides which are nearly parallel in homarinus
although no egg @-@ bearing females have been collected the gonopores openings of the oviducts of female cape lobsters are much larger than those of homarus gammarus and homarus americanus
this is thought to indicate that homarinus bears fewer larger eggs than homarus and that either the larvae develop quickly into juveniles after hatching or that the eggs hatch directly into juveniles
these include five males in the collections of the south african museum cape town two in the natural history museum london one in each of the east london museum the rijksmuseum van natuurlijke historie leiden and the albany museum grahamstown and one male and one female in the muséum national d 'histoire naturelle paris
in <year> a cape lobster was discovered at dassen island and the publicity the find generated resulted in more than <num> additional specimens being reported
the cape lobster was first described by johann friedrich wilhelm herbst in <year> as cancer astacus capensis
it was independently described in <year> by johan christian fabricius as astacus flavus possibly based on the same type specimen
when friedrich weber erected the genus homarus in <year> he included fabricius species in it but this placement was not followed by later authors
the species reached its current classification in <year> when the monotypic genus homarinus was erected by irv kornfield austin b
williams and robert s
steneck
while analyses of morphology suggest a close relationship between homarinus and homarus molecular analyses using mitochondrial dna reveal that they are not sister taxa
both genera lack ornamentation such as spines and carinae but are thought to have reached that state independently through convergent evolution
the closest living relative of homarus is nephrops norvegicus while the closest relatives of homarinus are thymops and thymopides

it includes the taff viaduct also known as the butetown link road bridge and the queen 's gate tunnel which is also known simply as the butetown tunnel
in <year> south glamorgan county council had intended to build a viaduct cross the river taff and then go onto an elevated section through butetown on stilts
but the newly formed cardiff bay development corporation along with local residents objected to the scheme that they said would cut through butetown and split the community creating an unnecessary physical barrier between the two areas to the north and south of the link road
by <year> south glamorgan county council had agreed to change the design of the link road despite having already spent <num> years of design work on the link road meant that a tunnel had to be built instead
the cost of the butetown link road was estimated to cost £ <num> million but this had risen to £ <num> in <year> before the design change
the contract to build the butetown link road was eventually won by a local company davies middleton davies ltd in a joint venture with an italian contractor cogefar @-@ impresit uk ltd
the bid of £ <num> million undercut all other bids by £ <num> million davies middleton davies ltd have subsequently gone into administrative receivership
the <num> m <num> @,@ <num> ft twin tunnel was constructed using the cut and cover method of construction which involves digging a trench for the tunnel and then roofing it over
the tunnel was constructed using reinforced concrete and a central wall separates the two sets of traffic
south glamorgan county council originally awarded the contract for the management installation testing and commissioning of all electrical and mechanical services for the tunnel and the water pumping stations to ei · whs ltd
they still maintain the tunnel on behalf of cardiff council
south glamorgan county council was the local authority in charge of the project at the time and construction of the viaduct began in march <year>
the taff viaduct crosses the river taff at cardiff bay
the viaduct was constructed using precast concrete segments which is widely used in the construction industry for medium to long span viaducts

the cost of the link road was estimated to cost gb £ <num> million in <year> and this increased to gb £ <num> million by august <year>
it could be paid for by congestion charging although a public @-@ private partnership is also possible
the original route of the link road had been challenged by both friends of the earth cymru and also the royal society for the protection of birds rspb who had both lodged formal objections against the link road
however the current proposal from cardiff council of <num> october <year> is to complete the first phase of the road approximately <num> km <num>
<num> mi in length from the butetown link road to ocean way roundabout
the new route would be a different route from the earlier proposal and would avoid any encroachment into the nature conservation area which friends of the earth and the rspb had objected to
therefore the new route of the link road should ensure that there are no objections
it was revealed on <num> june <year> that edwina hart minister for economy science and transport in the wag supported the completion the eastern bay link road
she said that the link road would improve access to cardiff bay improve access to the cardiff central enterprise zone and enhance connections within the cardiff city region
the overall objectives of the road would be to increase accessibility from east cardiff to major employment sites in the east moors area cardiff bay and the central cardiff enterprise zone provide a more direct route between the butetown tunnel and rover way reduce congestion at the junctions on tyndall street by removing traffic currently using the ocean way- east tyndall street – central link route reduce journey times for private and commercial road users help economic regeneration enhance road safety and reduce casualties improve resilience on the strategic road network around cardiff provide more opportunities for cycling and walking on <num> may <year> edwina hart approved the procurement of the design – build contractor advance service diversion works and communications arrangements for the eastern bay link road

the <year> puzzle platform game built around rotating between four 2d views of a 3d space was developed by indie developer polytron corporation and published by polytron trapdoor and microsoft studios
over the course of the game 's development fez designer and polytron founder phil fish received celebrity for his outspoken public persona and prominence in the <year> documentary indie game the movie which followed the game 's final stages of development and polytron 's related legal issues
the game was released to critical acclaim as an xbox live arcade timed exclusive and was later ported to other platforms
it had sold one million copies by the end of <year>
fish and shawn mcgrath collaborated on a puzzle game that became fez

levels were built in 3d by extruding surfaces with photoshop @-@ created textures
bédard and fish were joined by three different animators and other collaborators
the game was first announced in june <year> and won an award at the <year> independent games festival and entered the public spotlight
fish created a studio polytron corporation and was later aided by nearby developer @-@ publisher trapdoor when polytron ran out of money
fez won several more prerelease awards including the <year> seumas mcnally grand prize
nathan grayson of vg247 likened the game 's rocky development process to an indie duke nukem forever
polygon reviewer arthur gies wrote that the game was an underdog darling of the indie game scene for four years prior to its release
the game 's designer phil fish became renowned in a way unusual for game developers due to his prominence in indie game the movie which released in <year>
while the game was released to wide acclaim fish himself became known for his outspoken and acerbic public persona
the game that became fez began in a collaboration between montreal @-@ based phil fish and toronto @-@ based shawn mcgrath on mcgrath 's idea for a puzzle game a four @-@ sided 3d space with each side in 2d similar to fish 's 3d pixels voxels as incorporated into fez
the entirety of fez 's design lore and art descends from this game mechanic
fish provided the project 's art and credited his influence to shigeru miyamoto and hayao miyazaki
fish and mcgrath 's partnership crumbled due to creative differences as fish wanted to create a platform game
fish continued to work on the game in his spare time and announced his search for a programmer on deviantart and the first person to reply renaud bédard became lead programmer
they were both the same age and living in montreal
though bédard had some hobbyist experience in 3d graphics and was studying computer science fez was his first professional game development project
his first task was to write the level editor and game engine
fez was first announced in july <year> on the independent gaming source
a trailer released in october <year> convinced jason degroot to join the development team as a producer
degroot also known as <num> first met fish at a <year> e3 party and started work on the game 's soundtrack and sound effects
the soundtrack was ultimately composed by rich disasterpeace vreeland and the sound effects by brandon mccartin
the game was nominated for two awards at the <year> independent games festival igf at the game developers conference gdc excellence in visual art and the design innovation award
as fez was a side project fish was employed full @-@ time at artificial mind and movement in montreal where he worked on a tie @-@ in game for a film
he was not permitted time off to attend the event and thus decided to quit his job in january <year> — a moment he later marked as when i became indie
the game won excellence in visual art and created a surge of public interest in the game concurrent to a similar swell of interest in indie game developers
fish received a canadian government loan to open polytron corporation as a startup company and began full @-@ time work on fez
in july <year> polytron announced a release for xbox live arcade in early <year>
polytron and microsoft agreed to release fez as an xbox exclusive a deal fish later recalled as sensible
fish designed the game as a console game not a pc game and felt that the way he intended the game to be experienced — with a controller on a couch — was part of the medium
polytron ruled out a wiiware release due to problems fish had with their platform and developer options
development continued with a more experimental ethos until the company began to run out of capital
the canadian government loan that had funded polytron 's prototyping phase was not renewed for their production phase
they also lost funding from the organization that preceded the indie fund as polytron 's producer left the company
fish borrowed money from friends and family for three months to keep the company open
in dire straits he considered canceling the project
in march <year> the nearby québécois developer @-@ publisher trapdoor offered to help polytron having just signed a deal with electronic arts to publish their own game warp
trapdoor assisted with polytron 's finances and operations and offered to treat them as part of their company and let them keep their intellectual property rights in exchange for a portion of fez 's earnings
fish felt that partnership rescued the game
fish is shown preparing for fez 's march <year> pax east booth in the <year> documentary film indie game the movie which chronicles the stories of several indie developers at various stages of their games development cycles
as a subplot the film presents fish amidst a legal dispute with a former business partner that jeopardizes the game 's future
the partner believed to be jason degroot is portrayed negatively and does not participate onscreen
the film 's end credits were later corrected to reflect that fish 's business partner was not asked for input
game informer called fish the film 's most memorable developer and rock paper shotgun wrote that fish is portrayed as melodramatic theatrical and neurotic in a way that exacerbates his outspoken public perception
eurogamer said that the part where fish resolves to kill himself if he does not release his game is the film 's most startling moment
fez won the audience choice award at the september <year> fantastic arcade best in show and best story world design at the october <year> indiecade and the seumas mcnally grand prize at the <year> gdc independent games festival
it was also a <year> penny arcade expo pax <num> selection
fez was displayed in its entirety in a secluded lounge room at the october <year> gamecity festival in nottingham england
fish considered the demo their most fruitful yet
fish told a gamasutra reporter that he had received positive feedback from independent games festival chairman brandon boyer and braid designer jonathan blow
near the end of development fish felt burnt out and that his personal health had suffered
the final game included almost none of the original work from the first two years of development
after several delays fez was submitted for certification in february <year>
several months later polytron became embroiled in a high @-@ profile dispute with microsoft over the cost of patching the game
polytron had released a fix that resolved many of the game 's technical issues but introduced another that corrupted the saved games for about one percent of users
they withdrew the patch but found microsoft 's fee for subsequent patch releases unviable and chose to reinstate the withdrawn patch as their most utilitarian option
polytron drew ire for the decision which raised awareness for the business needs of indie developers
in july <year> a year later microsoft announced that they no longer charged for patches and fish tweeted that polytron 's patch would take a couple of months
speaking in retrospect of the release fish fiercely criticized fez co @-@ publisher microsoft games studios for botching the game 's release
fish cited a lack of promotion and publicity and poor advertising of the game on microsoft 's digital market
in march <year> fish announced a may <num> <year> release for the game 's pc port and opened preorders on gog
com and steam
the game 's os x and linux ports debuted in the pay @-@ what @-@ you @-@ want humble indie bundle <num> on september <num> <year>
polytron announced ports for playstation <num> playstation <num> and playstation vita in august <year> as in development through blitworks which were released on march <num> <year>
the playstation releases include cross @-@ console support for cross @-@ buy where one digital purchase allows access across multiple consoles and cross @-@ save game save sharing between consoles as well as support for 3d televisions the dualshock <num> controller 's decorative lightbar and graphical upgrades due to the full port into the c programming language
ports for ouya and ios were also announced
fish announced eventual ports for pretty much every platform but the nintendo 3ds
bédard planned to leave polytron after finishing fez to experience work with a full development team but stayed to port the windows release before joining toronto 's capybara games
he credited the game 's long development cycle to his own inexperience in game development compounded by the team 's small size and difficulty in setting reasonable milestones the game 's scope and fish 's perfectionism
fish had hoped that players would discuss fez 's nuances online after the game 's release
players collaborated online for a week to solve the final monolith puzzle by brute force
ars technica described the apparent end to the game 's harder puzzles as anticlimactic but fish told eurogamer in march <year> that hidden in @-@ game secrets remain to be found
more than three years after its digital launch fez received a physical release designed by fish and limited to a signed edition of <num> in december <year>
the deluxe package included the soundtrack and a stylized red notebook with gold foil inlay
he coded the game in microsoft visual c express and xna game studio express
his first task the level editor fezzer was coded from scratch in xna and inspired by sketchup
bédard also wrote the game engine trixel technology which turns 2d tiles triles into sides of a 3d cube pixel
the engine tracks player @-@ character gomez in 3d space even though the game behaves as a 2d platformer
bédard also built the game to resolve collisions when converting between 3d and 2d space
fish created pixel art in photoshop for each tiled side trile of the 3d trixel that bédard 's custom software compiled into 3d game assets which fish would extrude as surfaces in fezzer to build levels
fish found the level design process overwhelming and bédard has said he was relieved that it was not his job
fish compared his design process to playing with lego blocks and planned the more involved levels in graph paper to first visualize the 2d views before building the levels in the 3d software
the levels and puzzles were not preordained in a design document and many of the drafts levels scrapped in <year> resurfaced to be used later in the production process
so as to fit the rotation mechanic the levels were made tall instead of wide and the first part of the game was designed to acclimate the player to 2d controls before introducing the 3d element
as they worked fish first proposed ideas that bédard would implement
the two would then discuss and fine @-@ tune the addition — they worked well together
fish describes the game 's changes during development as organic — they tested different kinds of levels and replicated the types of in @-@ game exploration that the team appreciated most
it came to adopt metroidvania mechanics with secret passages warp gates and cheat codes
fish cited myst as another touchstone and compared its open world nonlinear narrative and obtuse metapuzzles to fez 's own alphabet numeric system and an almost unfairly hard to get second set of collectibles
fish originally fought against having an in @-@ game map because he wanted players to draft their own
after attempting to do so himself he changed his mind
fish later called the in @-@ game map probably one of the weakest aspects of the game
fish also fought against including the navigational assistant dot but later felt that the addition was successful and a positive contribution to the game 's mythology
the fez itself fish described as an ancient symbol of understanding the third dimension
fez had three different animators through its development paul robertson of scott pilgrim vs
the world the game who did the game 's animals and some of gomez 's animations adam saltsman of canabalt and graham lackey who did some character animations
the game 's mechanics were inspired by the nintendo entertainment system games fish played in his youth particularly super mario and the legend of zelda
fish cited fumito ueda 's ico as the game 's third inspiration and he sought to emulate its feeling of nostalgic and isolated loneliness
fish also sought to emulate ueda 's design by subtraction philosophy where the ico development team would periodically remove parts of the game so as to leave only what was essential to their vision
in this way ideas like player health and object weight puzzles were gradually struck from fez
fish made a personal challenge of designing a game without relying on established mechanics
as such fez was always a peaceful game and there was never an enemy coded into the game
so as to better emulate hayao miyazaki 's signature open blue sky feel @-@ good atmosphere fish watched all of the director 's films one weekend early in the development cycle
he was the son of an anglican clergyman intended for a career in the church but drawn instead to writing
among those who encouraged him were the authors henry james and arnold bennett
his skill at scene @-@ setting and vivid plots as well as his high profile as a lecturer brought him a large readership in the united kingdom and north america
he was a best @-@ selling author in the <num> and <num> but has been largely neglected since his death
after his first novel the wooden horse in <year> walpole wrote prolifically producing at least one book every year
he was a spontaneous story @-@ teller writing quickly to get all his ideas on paper seldom revising
his first novel to achieve major success was his third mr perrin and mr traill a tragicomic story of a fatal clash between two schoolmasters
during the first world war he served in the red cross on the russian @-@ austrian front and worked in british propaganda in petrograd and london
in the <num> and <num> walpole was much in demand not only as a novelist but also as a lecturer on literature making four exceptionally well @-@ paid tours of north america
as a gay man at a time when homosexual practices were illegal in britain walpole conducted a succession of intense but discreet relationships with other men and was for much of his life in search of what he saw as the perfect friend
he eventually found one a married policeman with whom he settled in the english lake district
having as a young man eagerly sought the support of established authors he was in his later years a generous sponsor of many younger writers
he was a patron of the visual arts and bequeathed a substantial legacy of paintings to the tate gallery and other british institutions
walpole 's output was large and varied
between <year> and <year> he wrote thirty @-@ six novels five volumes of short stories two original plays and three volumes of memoirs
his range included disturbing studies of the macabre children 's stories and historical fiction most notably his herries chronicle series set in the lake district
he worked in hollywood writing scenarios for two metro @-@ goldwyn @-@ mayer films in the <num> and played a cameo in the <year> version of david copperfield
somerset walpole had been an assistant to the bishop of truro edward benson from <year> until <year> when he was offered the incumbency of st mary 's pro @-@ cathedral auckland on benson 's advice he accepted
mildred walpole found it hard to settle in new zealand and something of her restlessness and insecurity affected the character of her eldest child
in <year> two years after the birth of the couple 's daughter dorothea dorothy somerset walpole accepted a prominent and well @-@ paid academic post at the general theological seminary new york
robert robin the third of the couple 's children was born in new york in <year>
hugh and dorothy were taught by a governess until the middle of <year> when the parents decided that he needed an english education
walpole was sent to england where according to his biographer rupert hart @-@ davis the next ten years were the unhappiest time of walpole 's life
he first attended a preparatory school in truro
though he missed his family and felt lonely he was reasonably happy but he moved to sir william borlase 's grammar school in marlow in <year> where he was bullied frightened and miserable
he later said the food was inadequate the morality was twisted and terror – sheer stark unblinking terror – stared down every one of its passages
the excessive desire to be loved that has always played so enormous a part in my life was bred largely i think from the neglect i suffered there
in <year> somerset walpole discovered his son 's horror of the marlow school and he moved him to the king 's school canterbury
for two years he was a fairly content though undistinguished pupil there
in <year> walpole senior was appointed principal of bede college durham and hugh was moved again to be a day boy for four years at durham school
he found that day boys were looked down on by boarders and that bede college was the subject of snobbery within the university
his sense of isolation increased
he continually took refuge in the local library where he read all the novels of jane austen henry fielding scott and dickens and many of the works of trollope wilkie collins and henry kingsley
walpole wrote in <year> i grew up
discontented ugly abnormally sensitive and excessively conceited
no one liked me – not masters boys friends of the family nor relations who came to stay and i do not in the least wonder at it
i was untidy uncleanly excessively gauche
i believed that i was profoundly misunderstood that people took my pale and pimpled countenance for the mirror of my soul that i had marvellous things of interest in me that would one day be discovered
though walpole was no admirer of the schools he had attended there the cathedral cities of truro canterbury and durham made a strong impression on him
he drew on aspects of them for his fictional cathedral city of polchester in glebeshire the setting of many of his later books
while there he had his first work published the critical essay two meredithian heroes which was printed in the college magazine in autumn <year>
as an undergraduate he met and fell under the spell of a c benson formerly a greatly loved master at eton and by this time a don at magdalene college
walpole 's religious beliefs hitherto an unquestioned part of his life were fading and benson helped him through that personal crisis
walpole was also attempting to cope with his homosexual feelings which for a while focused on benson who recorded in his diary in <year> an unexpected outburst by his young admirer h e broke out rather eagerly into protestations – he cared for me more than anyone in the world
i could not believe it
it is extraordinarily touching
it is quite right that he should believe all this passionately it is quite right that i should know that it will not last
i tried to say this as tenderly as i could
benson gently declined walpole 's advances
they remained friends but walpole rebuffed in his excessive desire to be loved turned the full force of his enthusiasms elsewhere and the relationship with benson became less important to him
less than two years later benson 's diary entry on walpole 's subsequent social career reveals his thoughts on his protégé 's progress he seems to have conquered gosse completely
he spends his sundays in long walks with h g wells
he dines every week with max beerbohm and r ross
and this has befallen a not very clever young man of <num>
am i a little jealous – no i don 't think so
but i am a little bewildered
i do not see any sign of intellectual power or perception or grasp or subtlety in his work or himself
i should call him curiously unperceptive
he does not for instance see what may vex or hurt or annoy people
i think he is rather tactless – though he is himself very sensitive
the strong points about him are his curiosity his vitality his eagerness and the emotional fervour of his affections
but he seems to me in no way likely to be great as an artist
with benson 's help walpole had come to terms with the loss of his faith
somerset walpole himself the son of an anglican priest hoped that his eldest son would follow him into the ministry
walpole was too concerned for his father 's feelings to tell him he was no longer a believer and on graduation from cambridge in <year> he took a post as a lay missioner at the mersey mission to seamen in liverpool
he described that as one of the greatest failures of my life
the mission to seamen was and is a splendid institution
but it needs men of a certain type to carry it through and i was not of that type
the head of the mission reprimanded him for lack of commitment to his work and walpole resigned after six months
from april to july <year> walpole was in germany tutoring the children of the popular author elizabeth von arnim
in <year> he taught french at epsom college
his brief experience of teaching is reflected in his third novel mr perrin and mr traill
as well as the clerical forebears walpole had notable authors in his family tree on his father 's side horace walpole the novelist and letter writer and on his mother 's richard harris barham author of the ingoldsby legends
it was as an author that walpole felt impelled to make his career
he moved to london and found work as a book reviewer for the standard writing fiction in his spare time
he had by this time recognised unreservedly that he was homosexual
his encounters were necessarily discreet as such activities were illegal in britain and remained so throughout his lifetime
he was constantly searching for the perfect friend an early candidate was the stage designer percy anderson to whom he was intimately attached for some time from <year> onwards
a correspondence ensued and in february <year> james invited walpole to lunch at the reform club in london
they developed a close friendship described by james 's biographer leon edel as resembling a father and son relationship in some but not all respects
james was greatly taken with the young walpole though clear @-@ eyed about the deficiencies in the artistry and craftsmanship of his protégé 's early efforts
according to somerset maugham walpole made a sexual proposition to james who was too inhibited to respond
nevertheless in their correspondence the older man 's devotion was couched in extravagant terms
walpole published his first novel the wooden horse in <year>
it told of a staid and snobbish english family shaken up by the return of one of its members from a less hidebound life in new zealand
the book received good reviews but barely repaid the cost of having it typed
his first commercial success was mr perrin and mr traill published in <year>
the novelist and biographer michael sadleir writes that though some of the six novels walpole wrote between <year> and <year> are of interest as examples of the author 's developing style it is mr perrin and mr traill that deserves to be remembered for its own sake
the book subtitled a tragi @-@ comedy is a psychological study of a deadly clash between two schoolmasters one an ageing failure and the other a young attractive idealist
in the view of hart @-@ davis walpole only once recaptured the fresh clear cut realism of this book and walpole himself looking back on his work in the <num> felt that of all his books to date it was the truest
the observer gave the book a favourable review the slow growth of the poison within perrin is traced with wonderful skill and sympathy
one feels throughout these pages a sense of intolerable tension of impending disaster the manchester guardian was less enthusiastic praising the scene @-@ setting but calling the story an unconscientious melodrama
the san francisco chronicle praised its technical excellence imagination and beauty – walpole at his best
arnold bennett a well @-@ established novelist seventeen years walpole 's senior admired the book and befriended the young author regularly chiding encouraging sometimes mocking him into improving his prose characters and narratives
the guardian reviewer observed that the setting of mr perrin and mr traill – a second @-@ rate public school – was clearly drawn from life as indeed it was
the boys of epsom college were delighted with the thinly disguised version of their school but the college authorities were not and walpole was persona non grata at epsom for many years
this was of no practical consequence as he had no intention of returning to the teaching profession but it was an early illustration of his capacity noted by benson for unthinkingly giving offence though being hypersensitive to criticism himself
in early <year> james wrote an article for the times literary supplement surveying the younger generation of british novelists and comparing them with their eminent elder contemporaries
in the latter category james put bennett joseph conrad john galsworthy maurice hewlett and h g wells
the four new authors on whom he focused were walpole gilbert cannan compton mackenzie and d h lawrence
it was a very lengthy article to the extent that it had to be spread across two issues of the supplement in march and april <year>
james said that agreeing to write it had been an insensate step but from walpole 's point of view it was highly satisfactory one of the greatest living authors had publicly ranked him among the finest young british novelists
he volunteered to join the police but was turned down he then accepted a journalistic appointment based in moscow reporting for the saturday review and the daily mail
he was allowed to visit the front in poland but his dispatches from moscow and later from petrograd which he preferred were not enough to stop hostile comments at home that he was not doing his bit for the war effort
henry james was so incensed at one such remark by a prominent london hostess that he stormed out of her house and wrote to walpole suggesting that he should return to england
walpole replied in great excitement that he had just been appointed as a russian officer in the sanitar the sanitar is the part of the red cross that does the rough work at the front carrying men out of the trenches helping at the base hospitals in every sort of way doing every kind of rough job
they are an absolutely official body and i shall be one of the few half @-@ dozen englishmen in the world wearing russian uniform
while in training for the sanitar walpole devoted his leisure hours to gaining a reasonable fluency in the russian language and to his first full @-@ length work of non @-@ fiction a literary biography of joseph conrad
in the summer of <year> he worked on the austrian @-@ russian front assisting at operations in field hospitals and retrieving the dead and wounded from the battlefield
occasionally he found time to write brief letters home he told bennett a battle is an amazing mixture of hell and a family picnic – not as frightening as the dentist but absorbing sometimes thrilling like football sometimes dull like church and sometimes simply physically sickening like bad fish
burying dead afterwards is worst of all
when disheartened he comforted himself with the thought this is not so bad as it was at marlow
during an engagement early in june <year> walpole single @-@ handedly rescued a wounded soldier his russian comrades refused to help and walpole carried one end of a stretcher and dragged the man to safety
for this he was awarded the cross of saint george general lechitsky presented him with the medal in august
after his tour of duty walpole returned to petrograd
among the city 's attractions for him was the presence of konstantin somov a painter with whom he had formed a close relationship
he remained there until october <year> when he returned to england
he visited his family stayed with percy anderson in london telephoned henry james in rye and retreated to a cottage he had bought in cornwall
in january <year> he was asked by the foreign office to return to petrograd
russians were being subjected to highly effective german propaganda
the writer arthur ransome petrograd correspondent of the daily news had successfully lobbied for the establishment of a bureau to counter the german efforts and the british ambassador sir george buchanan wanted walpole to take charge
before he left for petrograd walpole 's novel the dark forest was published
it drew on his experiences in russia and was more sombre than much of his earlier fiction
reviews were highly favourable the daily telegraph commented on a high level of imaginative vision
reveals capacity and powers in the author which we had hardly suspected before
walpole returned to petrograd in february <year>
he moved into somov 's flat and his anglo @-@ russian propaganda bureau began work
the following month he suffered a personal blow he recorded in his diary for <num> march <year> thirty two to @-@ day should have been a happy day but was completely clouded for me by reading in the papers of henry james death
this was a terrible shock to me
walpole remained at the bureau for the rest of <year> and most of <year> witnessing the february revolution
he wrote an official report on events for the foreign office and also absorbed ideas for his fiction
in addition to the first of his popular jeremy novels written in his spare time from the bureau he began work on the second of his russian @-@ themed books the secret city
sadleir writes that this novel and the dark forest take a high place among his works on account of their intuitive understanding of an alien mentality and the vigour of their narrative power
the book won the inaugural james tait black memorial prize for fiction
by late <year> it was clear to walpole and to the british authorities that there was little advantage in keeping him in russia
on <num> november he left missing the bolshevik revolution which began on that day
he was appointed to a post at the foreign office in its department of information headed by john buchan
soon after returning he volunteered for the british army but as expected failed the necessary medical examination because of his poor sight
he continued to work in british propaganda when the department was reconstituted under lord beaverbrook in april <year> and remained there for the rest of the war and beyond resigning in february <year>
little is known about what he wrote for the department as most of its records were destroyed after the war but he noted in his diary that he had written the department 's official report to the war cabinet a beastly job – the worst i 've ever attempted
for his wartime work he was awarded the cbe in <year>
at the instigation of his american publisher george doran he made his first lecture tour of the us in <year> receiving an enthusiastic welcome wherever he went
what sadleir describes as walpole 's genial and attractive appearance his complete lack of aloofness his exciting fluency as a speaker and his obvious and genuine liking for his hosts combined to win him a large american following
the success of his talks led to increases in his lecturing fees greatly enhanced sales of his books and large sums from american publishers anxious to print his latest fiction
he was a prodigiously quick writer who seldom revised but pressed on keen to get his ideas down on paper
his main british publishers macmillan found it expedient to appoint a senior member of staff to edit his manuscripts correcting spelling punctuation inconsistencies and errors of historical fact
his fluency enabled him to fulfil between tours a contract from the pictorial review for ten short stories at the remarkable sum of <num> @,@ <num> apiece
one of walpole 's major novels of the early post @-@ war period was the cathedral which unlike much of his fiction was not dashed off but worked on across four years beginning in <year>
the story of an arrogant <num> @-@ century archdeacon in conflict with other clergy and laity was certain to bring comparisons with trollope 's barchester towers the manchester guardian 's review was headed polchester towers but unlike the earlier work the cathedral is wholly uncomic
the hubristic archdeacon brandon is driven to domestic despair professional defeat and sudden death
the reviewer ivor brown commented that walpole had earlier charmed many with his cheerful tales of mayfair but that in this novel he showed a greater side to his art this is a book with little happiness about it but its stark strength is undeniable
the cathedral is realism profound in its philosophy and delicate in its thread
the illustrated london news said no former novelist has seized quite so powerfully upon the cathedral fabric and made it a living character in the drama an obsessing individuality at once benign and forbidding
the cathedral is a great book
walpole was a keen music lover and when in <year> he heard a new tenor at the proms he was much impressed and sought him out
lauritz melchior became one of the most important friendships of his life and walpole did much to foster the singer 's budding career
wagner 's son siegfried engaged melchior for the bayreuth festival in <year> and succeeding years
walpole attended and met adolf hitler then recently released from prison after an attempted putsch
hitler was a protégé of siegfried 's wife winifred and was known in bayreuth as one of winnie 's lame ducks
walpole later admitted that he had both despised and liked him – both emotions that time has proved i was wrong to indulge
this and future visits to bayreuth were complicated by the fact that winifred wagner fell in love with walpole and attached herself so firmly to him that rumours began to spread
in <year> walpole moved into a house near keswick in the lake district
his large income enabled him to maintain his london flat in piccadilly but brackenburn on the slopes of catbells overlooking derwentwater was his main home for the rest of his life
he was quickly made welcome by local residents and the scenery and atmosphere of the lake district often found their way into his fiction
the critic james agate commented that one might think from some of walpole 's stories that their author had created the english lakes but that he was probably only consulted about them
at the end of <year> walpole met harold cheevers who soon became his friend and companion and remained so for the rest of walpole 's life
in hart @-@ davis 's words he came nearer than any other human being to walpole 's long @-@ sought conception of a perfect friend
cheevers a policeman with a wife and two children left the police force and entered walpole 's service as his chauffeur
walpole trusted him completely and gave him extensive control over his affairs
whether walpole was at brackenburn or piccadilly cheevers was almost always with him and often accompanied him on overseas trips
walpole provided a house in hampstead for cheevers and his family
during the mid @-@ twenties walpole produced two of his best @-@ known novels in the macabre vein that he drew on from time to time exploring the fascination of fear and cruelty
the old ladies <year> is a study of a timid elderly spinster exploited and eventually frightened to death by a predatory widow
portrait of a man with red hair <year> depicts the malign influence of a manipulative insane father on his family and others
walpole described it to his fellow author frank swinnerton as a simple shocker which it has amused me like anything to write and won 't bore you to read
in contrast he continued a series of stories for children begun in <year> with jeremy taking the young hero 's story forward with jeremy and hamlet the latter being the boy 's dog in <year> and jeremy at crale in <year>
sadleir writing in the <num> suggests that the most real walpole of all – because the most unselfconscious kindly and understanding friend – is the walpole of the jeremy trilogy
of his other novels of the <num> wintersmoon <year> his first attempt at a full @-@ length love story portrays a clash between traditionalism and modernism his own sympathies though not spelled out were clearly with the traditionalists
his reputation in literary circles took a blow from a malicious caricature in somerset maugham 's <year> novel cakes and ale the character alroy kear a superficial novelist of more pushy ambition than literary talent was widely taken to be based on walpole
in the same year walpole wrote possibly his best @-@ known work rogue herries a historical novel set in the lake district
it was well @-@ received the daily mail considered it not only a profound study of human character but a subtle and intimate biography of a place
he followed it with three sequels all four novels were published in a single volume as the herries chronicle
in <year> walpole accepted an invitation from metro @-@ goldwyn @-@ mayer studios to go to hollywood to write the scenario for a film adaptation of david copperfield
he enjoyed many aspects of life in hollywood but as one who rarely revised any of his own work he found it tedious to produce sixth and seventh drafts at the behest of the studio
he enjoyed his brief change of role from writer to bit @-@ part player in the film he played the vicar of blunderstone delivering a boring sermon that sends david to sleep
agate was doubtful of the wisdom of this does not hugh see that to bring a well @-@ known character from real life into an imaginary sequence of events is to destroy the reality of that imaginary sequence nevertheless walpole 's performance was a success
he improvised the sermon the producer david o selznick mischievously called for retake after retake to try to make him dry up but walpole fluently delivered a different extempore address each time
the critical and commercial success of the film of david copperfield led to an invitation to return to hollywood in <year>
when he got there he found that the studio executives had no idea which films they wanted him to work on and he had eight weeks of highly paid leisure during which he wrote a short story and worked on a novel
he was eventually asked to write the scenario for little lord fauntleroy which he enjoyed doing
he spent most of his fees on paintings forgetting to keep enough money to pay us tax on his earnings
he replenished his american funds with a lecture tour – his last – in late <year>
in <year> walpole was offered a knighthood
he accepted though confiding to his diary that he could not think of a good novelist since walter scott who had done so
kipling hardy galsworthy all refused
but i 'm not of their class and range with doyle anthony hope and such
besides i shall like being a knight
walpole 's taste for adventure did not diminish in his last years
in <year> he was commissioned to report for william randolph hearst 's newspapers on the funeral in rome of pope pius xi the conclave to elect his successor and the subsequent coronation
a fellow correspondent was tom driberg whose memoirs tell of a lunch à deux at which walpole arrived flushed with excitement from a sexual encounter that morning with an attendant in the borghese palace
in the weeks between the funeral and pius xii 's election walpole with his customary fluency wrote much of his book roman fountain a mixture of fact and fiction about the city
this was his last overseas visit
after the outbreak of the second world war walpole remained in england dividing his time between london and keswick and continuing to write with his usual rapidity
he completed a fifth novel in the herries series and began work on a sixth
his health was undermined by diabetes
he overexerted himself at the opening of keswick 's fund @-@ raising war weapons week in may <year> making a speech after taking part in a lengthy march and died of a heart attack at brackenburn aged <num>
he is buried in st john 's churchyard in keswick
sir kenneth clark called him one of the three or four real patrons of art in this country and of that small body he was perhaps the most generous and the most discriminating
he left fourteen works to the tate gallery and fitzwilliam museum including paintings by cézanne manet augustus john tissot and renoir
other artists represented in walpole 's collection were epstein picasso gauguin sickert and utrillo
after his death the finest works in his collection other than those bequeathed were exhibited in london during april and may <year> the exhibition also included works by constable turner and rodin
sadleir notes how walpole 's considerable income enabled him to indulge not only his love of art and of old books and manuscripts but also philanthropy particularly towards younger writers
although walpole enjoyed the limelight he was secretive about his many acts of generosity to younger writers with both encouragement and financial help
after his death some idea of the scale of his generosity was discovered
osbert sitwell commented i don 't think there was any younger writer of any worth who has not at one time or another received kindness of an active kind and at a crucial moment from hugh
hart @-@ davis lists thirty @-@ eight authors from whom letters of gratitude were found among walpole 's correspondence sadleir writes of walpole 's generous kindness to literary aspirants and to writers fallen on evil days
by immediate financial assistance by prefaces freely supplied or by collaboration volunteered by introductions and recommendations to likely publishers walpole relieved the distresses of authorship to a degree which will never be fully known
agate though himself the recipient of walpole 's generosity on occasion thought it sometimes went too far mr walpole 's large @-@ heartedness gets him into all kinds of trouble
he is an inveterate patter
he pats on the back young men whom sterner critics would knock down because even in fantastic incompetence he perceives the good intention
no art or artist is safe from mr walpole 's benevolence
in his adopted home of keswick a section of the town museum was dedicated to walpole 's memory in <year> with manuscripts correspondence paintings and sculpture from brackenburn donated by his sister and brother
his fiction includes short stories bildungsromane mr perrin and mr traill <year> and the jeremy trilogy that delve into the psychology of boyhood gothic horror novels portrait of a man with red hair <year> and the killer and the slain <year> a period family saga the herries chronicle and even detective fiction behind the screen
he wrote literary biographies conrad <year> james branch cabell <year> and trollope <year> plays and screenplays including david copperfield <year>
other critics noted the trollopian influence in <year> arthur st john adcock commented the trenchards in the green mirror are a kind of family trollope might have created had he been living now the cathedral is a kind of story he might have told with its realistic melodrama and its clerical atmosphere but walpole tells it with a subtler art in the writing and the construction with a conciseness and charm of style that are outside the range of the earlier novelist
walpole though he was devoted to the works of trollope and published a study of him thought that there was no real comparison between the two of them i am far too twisted and fantastic a novelist ever to succeed in catching trollope 's marvellous normality
priestley was less impressed by the supposed trollopian side of walpole 's work finding some of it formulaic
he was more taken with a darker dostoyevskian side that he found in the writing suddenly it will transform the pleasant easy scene he is giving us into transparency behind which are bright stars and red hellfire
no matter how jolly and zestful he may appear to be the fact remains that he possesses an unusually sharp sense of evil
possibly the most pervasive influence on walpole was walter scott whose romanticism is reflected in much of the later writer 's fiction
such was walpole 's love of scott that he liked to think of himself as the latter 's reincarnation
he amassed the largest collection in britain of scott manuscripts and early editions and constantly reread the novels
with the herries stories walpole restored the popularity of the historical novel a form for which scott was famous but which had been out of fashion for decades
the herries series begins in the <num> century and follows a lakeland family through the generations up to modern times
in his early days he received frequent and generally approving scrutiny from major literary figures
he was a good friend of virginia woolf and rated her as an influence she praised his gift for seizing on telling detail it is no disparagement to a writer to say that his gift is for the small things rather than for the large
if you are faithful with the details the large effects will grow inevitably out of those very details
joseph conrad said of him we see mr
walpole grappling with the truth of things spiritual and material with his characteristic earnestness and we can discern the characteristics of this acute and sympathetic explorer of human nature
in <year> priestley observed when i first remember seeing hugh walpole 's name he had no public at all but the ferocious young reviewers – the highbrows as we have since learned to call them – delighted in him
now he has an enormous public both in england and america and the young highbrows – who are saddened by the thought of a large public – are not particularly fond of him
priestley contended that walpole had fulfilled his early potential unlike compton mackenzie gilbert cannan and other promising young novelists of his generation
this view was not universal among critics walpole sometimes divided opinion
writing of walpole 's russian novels the contemporary critic and novelist douglas goldring commented russia has been the grave of many reputations and our napoleon of the drawing @-@ room novel has fared no better than other would @-@ be conquerors of that disconcerting land
goldring 's complaint was that walpole 's russian and english characters were clichéd stereotypes
the reviewer in punch by contrast wrote i consulted a russian who is very much alive and received the opinion that if mr
walpole has not succeeded in drawing the real average russian he has given us a type whose faults and virtues sound the keynote of the situation as it is to @-@ day
the observer rated the dark forest as one of the finest novels of our generation
in <year> ernest hemingway wrote into a short story a comparison of g k chesterton and walpole concluding that the former was the better man the latter a better writer and both were classics
walpole could be sensitive about his literary reputation and often took adverse criticism badly
when hilaire belloc praised p g wodehouse as the best english writer of their day walpole took it amiss to the amusement of wodehouse who regarded belloc 's plaudit as a gag to get a rise out of serious @-@ minded authors whom he disliked
wodehouse was not a great admirer of walpole his own scrupulous craftsmanship with drafts polished over and over again was the opposite of walpole 's hastily written and seldom @-@ revised prose
he also viewed walpole 's sensitivity to criticism as absurd
walpole was not always as oversensitive as wodehouse supposed
the critic james agate was a friend despite his regular rude remarks about walpole 's prose and when walpole discovered that agate had written a spoof of the herries lakeland style he made him promise to print it in the next published volume of his diaries
during his career contemporaries saw both negative and positive sides to walpole 's outgoing nature and desire to be in the public eye
wodehouse commented i always think hugh walpole 's reputation was two thirds publicity
he was always endorsing books and speaking at lunches and so on
on the other hand walpole stood out as one of the few literary figures willing to go into court and give evidence for the defence at the obscenity trial after the novel the well of loneliness was published
by the time of his death the times 's estimation of walpole was no higher than he had a versatile imagination he could tell a workmanlike story in good workmanlike english and he was a man of immense industry conscientious and painstaking
the belittling tone of the obituary brought forth strong rebuttals from t s eliot kenneth clark and priestley among others
within a few years of his death walpole was seen as old @-@ fashioned and his works were largely neglected
in the oxford dictionary of national biography elizabeth steele summed up his psychology was not deep enough for the polemicist his diction not free enough for those returning from war and his zest disastrous to a public wary of personal commitment
in <year> peter hitchens an admirer of walpole though not an uncritical one wrote henry james and john buchan praised him
joseph conrad t s eliot and virginia woolf were kind about him
what 's more his books sold enormously well on both sides of the atlantic he was knighted and he became very rich
yet now he has vanished completely his books not even to be found on the back shelves of most second hand shops dismissed as unreadable
walpole 's works have not been completely neglected in recent years
the herries stories have seldom been out of print and in <year> worldcat listed a dozen recent reissues of walpole 's works including the wooden horse the dark forest the secret city jeremy and the cathedral
in <year> the bbc broadcast a reappraisal of walpole the walpole chronicle presented by eric robson
in <year> a new stage version of rogue herries was presented by the theatre by the lake company in walpole 's adopted home of keswick
the bbc speculated that this could mark a revival in interest in his works
the first in <year> was written by rupert hart @-@ davis who had known walpole personally
it was regarded at the time as among the half dozen best biographies of the century and has been reissued several times since its first publication
writing when homosexuality was still outlawed in england hart @-@ davis avoided direct mention of his subject 's sexuality so respecting walpole 's habitual discretion and the wishes of his brother and sister
he left readers to read between the lines if they wished in for example references to turkish baths providing informal opportunities of meeting interesting strangers
hart @-@ davis dedicated the book to dorothy robin and harold walpole 's sister brother and long @-@ term companion
in <year> elizabeth steele 's study of walpole was published
much shorter than hart @-@ davis 's biography at <num> pages to his <num> it dealt mainly with the novels and aimed to show the sources of hugh walpole 's success as a writer during the thirty @-@ five years and fifty books of his busy career
steele concentrated on half a dozen of walpole 's best books each illustrating aspects of his writing under the headings acolyte artist witness evangelist critic and romanticist
steele also wrote a study of walpole 's north american lecture tours <year> and the article on walpole in the oxford dictionary of national biography <year> which treats his private life briefly but candidly
as a son of murchad mac diarmata king of dublin and the isles domnall was a grandson of diarmait mac máel na mbó king of leinster and thus a member of the uí chennselaig
domnall was also the first of the meic murchada a branch of the uí chennselaig named after his father
in <num> the year before his grandfather 's death domnall and an uí chennselaig kinsman donnchad mac domnaill remair battled for control of leinster
although domnall is accorded the title king of leinster in one mediaeval king @-@ list donnchad was evidently a more powerful claimant and domnall appears to have held the leinster kingship in name only
domnall 's rise to power in the kingdom of dublin took place in <num> after the expulsion of the reigning gofraid mac amlaíb meic ragnaill king of dublin by the latter 's overlord toirdelbach ua briain king of munster
the circumstances surrounding domnall 's accession are uncertain
he may have collaborated with gofraid to wrench the kingdom from the grip of the uí briain or he may have been installed in the kingship by toirdelbach himself and ruled under the latter 's overlordship
whatever the case domnall died within the year and toirdelbach placed his own son muirchertach upon the throne
domnall was therefore a member of the uí chennselaig as well as the first of the meic murchada a branch of the uí chennselaig named after his father
domnall had two brothers donnchad died <num> a later king of leinster and énna
in <num> domnall 's aforesaid grandfather conquered the kingdom of dublin from echmarcach mac ragnaill king of dublin and the isles died <num> <num> and soon after appointed murchad as king of dublin
about a decade later murchad appears to have driven echmarcach from mann after which he gained the kingship of the isles
diarmait 's deep @-@ rooted authority in norse @-@ gaelic dublin lasted for two decades and was a remarkable achievement that no other irish king had ever accomplished
unfortunately for the uí chennselaig two of diarmait 's sons — murchad and glún iairn — unexpectedly predeceased their father in <num> and diarmait himself fell in battle two years later
specifically the annals of the four masters and the annals of inisfallen reveal that domnall battled against the forces of his own first cousin once removed donnchad mac domnaill remair died <num> before diarmait 's ally toirdelbach ua briain king of munster died <num> was able to intervene and restore order in the kingdom of leinster
up until about the time of his death diarmait had been the most powerful king in southern ireland
in consequence of the void left by his demise diarmait 's erstwhile ally toirdelbach seized the initiative and moved to enforce his own claim to the high @-@ kingship of ireland
he immediately imposed his overlordship on leinster — a task almost certainly expedited by the aforesaid infighting amongst the uí chennselaig — and took control of dublin
whilst the imposition of authority upon rival provincial kingdoms was a fundamental part in gaining the high @-@ kingship toirdelbach 's decision to march @-@ on dublin reveals that the acquisition of this coastal kingdom had also become an essential part of the process
toirdelbach 's subsequent capture of donnchad in dublin suggests that the latter was not only the leading uí chennselaig dynast but was also in the process of using the town as the capital of leinster
although the list of leinster kings in the book of leinster declares that domnall had succeeded his grandfather as king of leinster it is apparent that donnchad was indeed the more powerful claimant
in fact the king @-@ list of uí chennselaig in the same source makes no notice of domnall and states that it was donnchad who succeeded diarmait as king of uí chennselaig
domnall therefore may not have reigned in leinster and could well have been king of leinster in name only
if the annals of inisfallen is to be believed toirdelbach acquired possession of dublin when the dubliners themselves offered him its kingship
although this record may be mere uí briain propaganda it could instead reveal that the dubliners preferred a distant overlord from munster rather than one from neighbouring leinster
within the year the kingship was held by gofraid mac amlaíb meic ragnaill died <num>
the latter appears to have been a kinsman of echmarcach and may well have been handed the kinship by toirdelbach perhaps on account of the considerable distance between the kingdoms
there is uncertainty concerning the circumstances of gofraid 's expulsion and of domnall 's accession
on one hand it is possible that gofraid was involved in lending assistance to anglo @-@ danish resistance against the norman regime in the recently conquered kingdom of england
if correct gofraid would appear to have been at odds with toirdelbach a monarch who appears to have cultivated close links with the norman regime
domnall therefore may have had toirdelbach 's consent to rule in dublin as gofraid 's replacement
in fact toirdelbach 's placement of domnall in dublin and his allowance of the latter 's aforesaid cousin in leinster may have been a way in which the uí briain exploited the fractured uí chennselaig
certainly domnall 's cooperation would have been a valuable asset to toirdelbach considering the prominence of his father amongst the dubliners and the likelihood that domnall himself may have lived most of his life there
on the other hand it is possible that gofraid was driven from the kingship because he had aligned himself with the leinstermen against the uí briain
if such a sequence of events is correct it could mean that even though gofraid was unable continue on with the revolt it was his uí chennselaig confederates who succeeded in securing dublin from the uí briain
whatever the circumstances of domnall 's accession the uí chennselaig regime in dublin was short @-@ lived
the annals of inisfallen the annals of the four masters and the annals of ulster all reveal that within the year domnall died after a brief illness with the latter two sources specifying that he succumbed after three nights of sickness
the annals of inisfallen and the annals of ulster accord him the title king of dublin and make no mention of any connection with the leinster kingship
upon domnall 's demise toirdelbach had his own son muirchertach died <num> appointed king of dublin
in so doing toirdelbach reinforced his authority in dublin and followed a precedent started by domnall 's grandfather in which a claimant to the high @-@ kingship of ireland installed his own heir to the kingship of dublin
it premiered on the fox network on january <num> <year>
the episode was written by series creator chris carter directed by david nutter and featured the first of two guest appearances by nick chinlund as the death fetishist killer donnie pfaster
the episode is a monster @-@ of @-@ the @-@ week story a stand @-@ alone plot which is unconnected to the series wider mythology
the episode was viewed by <num>
<num> million people upon its first broadcast and received positive reviews with much praise to chinlund 's performance as the antagonist
the show centers on fbi special agents fox mulder david duchovny and dana scully gillian anderson who work on cases linked to the paranormal called x @-@ files
in the episode mulder and scully investigate a death fetishist who begins kidnapping and killing women to satisfy his obsession
scully still recovering from her earlier abduction is soon overcome with posttraumatic stress disorder
irresistible is one of the few in the series that has no paranormal elements to it
initially the script called for donnie pfaster to be a necrophiliac but the idea was soon rejected by the fox broadcasting company for being unacceptable for broadcast standards
pfaster was eventually brought back in the season seven episode orison
the ceremony is observed by donnie pfaster the eerie assistant director for the funeral home
later that night as the girl 's body is being stored for burial the following day pfaster 's boss finds him cutting off the corpse 's hair
pfaster is promptly fired
some time later fox mulder and dana scully are summoned to minneapolis by moe bocks an fbi field agent who is investigating the exhumation and desecration of a body in a local cemetery
mulder discounts bocks theory that this act is a variation of extraterrestrial cattle mutilation and suggests they search for a human culprit
scully is disturbed at the sight of the disheveled corpse
two more bodies are found exhumed with their hair cut and fingernails removed
mulder develops a psychological profile of the criminal believing him to be an escalating death fetishist who may resort to murder to satisfy his desires
scully keeps her discomfort with the case to herself and writes up a field report on necrophilia
pfaster who was behind the exhumations proves mulder 's prediction correct when he brings a prostitute to his apartment
when the prostitute discovers a collection of funerary wreaths in pfaster 's bedroom he kills her and removes her fingers
later pfaster — having been hired as a frozen food delivery man through charming the female interviewer — delivers to a low @-@ security house of a woman with teenage daughters
he requests the bathroom to wash his hands and whilst there steals some discarded hair from a brush he found in the trashcan
pfaster attends a night class at a community college where a female classmate defends herself after he makes threatening advances
he is arrested and is placed in a jail cell across from a suspect being interrogated for pfaster 's crimes by mulder scully and bocks
pfaster shows interest in scully and learns her name from the interrogated suspect
pfaster is later released as his charges were dropped
scully is deeply troubled by pfaster 's crimes and has unsettling dreams and hallucinations about the case
in washington she has a counseling session with a social worker during which she shares her anxiety about the investigation
after the session scully learns that someone from minnesota had called for her
when she contacts mulder she learns that neither he nor bocks made the call
tracing a fingerprint to pfaster from his arrest bocks and mulder raid his apartment finding one of the prostitute 's fingers in his refrigerator
meanwhile after scully arrives in minneapolis pfaster forces her car off the road
he kidnaps scully and takes her to his late mother 's abandoned house
he ties and gags scully and keeps her in a dark closet
mulder and bocks discover that pfaster 's mother had owned a car which matches paint found on scully 's abandoned car tracking down her former residence
meanwhile scully escapes from pfaster as he prepares a cold bath for her resulting in a pursuit through the house
scully and pfaster have a struggle that sends them falling down a staircase onto the foyer where a task force led by mulder and bocks breaks in moments later and apprehends pfaster
scully initially insists that she is okay but then breaks down and cries in mulder 's arms
in a voice @-@ over narration mulder traces pfaster 's pathology to his childhood when he was raised in a family of four older sisters
mulder also reflects on pfaster 's nature and the nature of evil in general
as series creator chris carter described it when i handed the script in it was really for a necrophiliac episode and that just didn 't fly
you cannot do the combination of sex and death on network television
carter was forced to tone down the script by changing pfaster from a necrophiliac to a death fetishist and diminishing pfaster 's sexual obsession
he considered that the sexual content was implied and understood by audiences and that pfaster still resulted in a creepy character particularly his creepy arrogance in using shampoo on the hair of his victims
the episode 's original title was fascination
the episode is one of the few in the series that has no paranormal elements to it
carter said of the episode 's conception my first chance to work with david nutter in a long time and i wanted to give him something he could sink his teeth into
it 's a little bit different for us
it doesn 't really have a paranormal aspect except for scully 's perceptions of her deepest fears
i felt that i had to figure out what she is most afraid of and she is most afraid of those things that most of us are afraid of
the idea of dying at the hands of someone — creature or not — and she is helpless to do anything about it
i thought it was a very good way to explore scully 's character
the scene where dana scully imagines pfaster appearing as a devil was influenced by real @-@ life accounts as described by carter there are reports of people who had been under the spell of jeffrey dahmer who actually claimed that he shape @-@ shifted during those hours when they were held hostage that his image actually changed
nutter said in many ways chris wanted to sell the idea that as established in mulder 's closing dialogue in the show not all terror comes from the paranormal
it could come from the person next door
carter said of the casting of nick chinlund as pfaster i thought it was a wonderfully creepy villain
the casting of that show was very difficult
we saw many actors but there was a quality i was looking for and i couldn 't put a name on that quality
i finally figured out what it was when nick came in and he had a kind of androgynous quality that worked
i thought he looked like joe college but he could scare the hell out of you
producer glen morgan said chinlund 's performance was outstanding
nutter stated nick chinlund was wonderful to work with
the guy was like putty in my hands
he was great
if you 're looking for someone to underline the weirdness and strangeness of the character he did that
nutter said of the episode i really worked hard to make it a special show because i thought it was special
it was gillian 's post @-@ traumatic stress episode because she had not really had the opportunity to vent her feelings about the whole duane barry situation
this was an opportunity to sit back and let all that happen
carter particularly liked the scene where a clearly disturbed scully hugs mulder claiming it was a tender moment between two characters that had not shown that much affection for each other
this episode earned a nielsen rating of <num>
<num> with a <num> share meaning that roughly <num>
<num> percent of all television @-@ equipped households and <num> percent of households watching television were tuned in to the episode
it was viewed by <num>
<num> million households
entertainment weekly rated irresistible a b saying it was based on an unsettling concept to begin with that was reinforced by chinlund 's skin @-@ crawling one @-@ man show
todd vanderwerff of the a
v
club rated the episode a praising the acting particularly of chinlund as pfaster and describing it as legitimately scary a sign of a show that was pushing itself in new and interesting directions
the only criticism was for the scenes where scully hallucinates pfaster shapeshifting as pretty silly almost feeling like an attempt to make sure something vaguely paranormal is in the episode so the fans don 't get bored with what is ultimately a very good episode
jessica morgan of television without pity gave the episode a b grade
writing for den of geek nina sordi ranked irresistible the sixth best x @-@ files episode saying that excluding csm and his cronies pfaster has got to be the most disturbing villain that our favorite agents have encountered
den of geek writer juliette harrisson named it the finest stand @-@ alone episode of the second season describing it as a genuinely creepy <num> @-@ minute horror movie
connie ogle of popmatters listed pfaster among the best monster @-@ of @-@ the @-@ week characters of the series and ign 's christine seghers ranked chinlund the seventh best guest star in the history of the show considering that what makes him all the more frightening is how downright passive and polite he is up until the moment he 's going to kill the perfect camouflage for a modern @-@ day monster
tv guide listed pfaster among the scariest x @-@ files monsters describing him as evil incarnate
chris carter said irresistible was effective for being really scary and that not only it was one of his favorites but inspired him to create the television series millennium later
it was produced between <year> and <year> using a form of electronic marionette puppetry dubbed supermarionation combined with scale model special effects sequences
two series were filmed comprising a total of <num> episodes
production ceased after lew grade the andersons financial backer failed in his efforts to sell the programme to american network television
set in the mid @-@ <num> thunderbirds is a follow @-@ up to the earlier supermarionation productions four feather falls supercar fireball xl5 and stingray
it follows the exploits of international rescue ir a life @-@ saving organisation equipped with technologically @-@ advanced land sea air and space rescue craft these are headed by a fleet of five vehicles named the thunderbirds and launched from ir 's secret base in the pacific ocean
the main characters are ex @-@ astronaut jeff tracy the founder of ir and his five adult sons who pilot the thunderbird machines
thunderbirds began its first run in the united kingdom on the itv network in <year> and has since been broadcast in at least <num> other countries
periodically repeated it was adapted for radio in the early <num> and has influenced many tv programmes and other media
as well as inspiring various merchandising campaigns the series has been followed by two feature @-@ length film sequels a live @-@ action film adaptation and a mimed stage show tribute
the second of two tv remakes the computer @-@ animated thunderbirds are go premiered in <year>
widely considered to be the andersons most popular and commercially successful series thunderbirds has received particular praise for its effects directed by derek meddings and musical score composed by barry gray
it is also well remembered for its title sequence which opens with an often @-@ quoted countdown by actor peter dyneley who voiced the character of jeff <num> <num> <num> <num> <num> thunderbirds are go a real @-@ life rescue service the international rescue corps is named after the organisation featured in the series
he is a widower with five adult sons scott john virgil gordon and alan
the tracys form international rescue ir a secret organisation dedicated to saving human life
they are aided in this mission by technologically advanced land sea air and space vehicles which are called into service when conventional rescue techniques prove ineffective
the most important of these are five machines named the thunderbirds each assigned to one of the five tracy brothers thunderbird <num> a hypersonic rocket plane used for fast response and accident zone reconnaissance
piloted by primary rescue co @-@ ordinator scott tracy
thunderbird <num> a supersonic carrier aircraft that transports rescue vehicles and equipment to accident zones in detachable capsules known as pods

with the engineer brains and jeff 's elderly mother as well as the malaysian manservant kyrano and his daughter tin @-@ tin the family reside in a luxurious villa on tracy island their hidden base in the south pacific ocean
in this location ir is safe from criminals and spies who envy the organisation 's technology and seek to acquire the secrets of its machines
despite its humanitarian principles some of ir 's operations are necessitated not by misadventure but deliberate sabotage motivated by greed for power and wealth
for missions that require criminal investigation the organisation incorporates a network of undercover agents headed by english aristocrat lady penelope creighton @-@ ward and her butler aloysius parker
based at creighton @-@ ward mansion in kent penelope and parker 's primary mode of transport is fab <num> a specially @-@ modified rolls @-@ royce
the most persistent of ir 's adversaries is the criminal known only as the hood
operating from a temple in the malaysian jungle and possessing abilities of hypnosis and dark magic he exerts a powerful telepathic control over kyrano his estranged half @-@ brother and manipulates the tracys into missions that unfold according to his nefarious designs
this allows him to spy on the thunderbird machines and by selling their secrets make himself rich
pitched in late <year> the series was commissioned by lew grade of itc apf 's parent company on the back of the positive audience response to stingray
gerry anderson drew inspiration for the series underlying concept from the west german mining disaster known as the wunder von lengede miracle of lengede
in october <year> the collapse of a nearby dam flooded an iron mine in the municipality of lengede killing <num> miners and trapping <num> others underground
lacking the means to drill an escape shaft the authorities were forced to requisition a heavy @-@ duty bore from bremen the considerable time necessary to ship this device by rail had significantly reduced the chances of a successful rescue
recognising the advantages of swifter crisis response anderson conceived the idea of an international rescue organisation that could use supersonic aircraft to transport specialised rescue equipment quickly over long distances
seeking to distinguish his <num> @-@ episode proposal from apf 's earlier productions anderson attempted to pitch stories at a level that would appeal to both adults and children
whereas previous series had been shown during the late afternoon anderson wanted thunderbirds to be broadcast in a family @-@ friendly primetime slot
sylvia remembers that our market had grown and a kidult show
was the next step
the andersons retired to their holiday villa in portugal to expand the premise script the pilot episode and compose a scriptwriters guide
according to sylvia the writing process depended on a division of labour whereby gerry created the action sequences while she managed characterisation
the decision to make a father and his sons the main characters was influenced by the premise of bonanza as well as sylvia 's belief that the use of more than one heroic character would broaden the series appeal
the tracy brothers were named after mercury seven astronauts scott carpenter john glenn virgil gus grissom gordon cooper and alan shepard
the series title was derived from a letter written by gerry 's brother lionel while he had been serving overseas as an raf flight sergeant during world war ii
while stationed in arizona lionel had made reference to thunderbird field a nearby united states army air forces base
drawn to the punchiness of thunderbirds anderson dropped his working title of international rescue and renamed both the series and ir 's rescue vehicles which had previously been designated rescues <num> to <num>
his inspiration for the launch sequences of thunderbirds <num> <num> and <num> originated from contemporary united states air force launch procedure anderson had learnt how the strategic air command would keep its pilots on permanent standby seated in the cockpits of their aircraft and ready for take @-@ off at a moment 's notice
in the dvd documentary the thunderbirds companion anderson explained how a rise in filming costs had made overseas distribution revenue even more important and essentially caused thunderbirds to be made as an american show
during the character development and voice casting process the andersons main priority was to ensure that the series had transatlantic appeal thus increasing the chances of winning an american network deal and the higher audience figures that this market had to offer
scripts were typed in american english and printed on us @-@ style quarto @-@ size paper
in preparation the number of full @-@ time crew was expanded to <num>
shooting began in september <year> after five months of pre @-@ production
due to the new series technical complexity this was a period longer than for any of apf 's earlier productions
to speed up the filming episodes were shot in pairs at a rate of one per month on separate soundstages and by separate crews designated a and b
by <year> apf was the uk 's largest commercial user of colour film consuming more than three million feet <num> miles or <num> kilometres of stock per year
alan pattillo a veteran scriptwriter and director for apf was appointed the company 's first official script editor in late <year>
this move was aimed to reduce the burden on gerry anderson who while reserving his producer 's right to overall creative control had grown weary of revising scripts himself
direction of episodes was assigned in pairs pattillo and david elliott alternated with the less experienced desmond saunders and newcomer david lane for each month 's filming
due to the difficulties of setting up takes progress was slow even on a productive day it was rare for the crew to complete more than two minutes of puppet footage in a contemporary interview hill noted that thunderbirds contained several times as many shots as a typical live @-@ action series
he explained that rapid editing was necessary on account of the characters lack of facial expression which made it difficult to sustain the viewer 's interest for more than a few seconds per shot
after viewing the completed <num> @-@ minute pilot trapped in the sky lew grade was so impressed by apf 's work that he instructed anderson to double the episode length and increased the series budget per episode from £ <num> @,@ <num> to £ <num> @,@ <num>
as a result thunderbirds became not only the company 's longest and highest @-@ budgeted production but also among the most expensive tv series to have been made up to that point
the crew who had been filming at a rate of two <num> @-@ minute episodes per fortnight faced significant challenges during the transition to the new format eight episodes had already been completed scripts for up to ten more had been written and substantial rewrites would be necessary to satisfy the longer running time
anderson lamented our time @-@ scale was far too drawn out
itc 's new york office insisted that they should have one show a fortnight
everything had to move at twice the speed
apf spent over seven months extending the existing episodes
tony barwick who had impressed pattillo and the andersons with an unsubmitted script that he had written for danger man was recruited to assist in the writing of subplots and filler material
he found that the longer format created opportunities to strengthen the characterisation
science @-@ fiction writer john peel suggests that small character touches make the puppet cast of thunderbirds much more rounded than those of earlier apf series
he compares the writing favourably to that of live @-@ action drama
the new footage proved useful during the development of the first series finale security hazard since the previous two episodes had overspent their budgets pattillo devised a flashback @-@ dominated clip show containing only <num> minutes of new material to reduce costs
filming of series one was completed in december <year>
a second series was also commissioned late that year and entered production in march <year>
barwick became a full @-@ time member of the writing staff and took over the role of script editor from the outgoing pattillo
the main puppet cast and vehicles were rebuilt in addition the art department expanded some of the standing sets including the tracy villa lounge and the thunderbird <num> control room
to accommodate the simultaneous filming of the tv series and thunderbirds are go apf purchased two more buildings on the slough trading estate and converted them into new stages
as crew and studio space were divided between the two productions filming of the tv series progressed at half the previous speed as apf 's b crew produced one episode per month
filming on thunderbirds are go was completed by june allowing a crew to resume work on the series to shoot what would prove to be its penultimate episode ricochet
production of thunderbirds ended in august <year> with the completion of the sixth episode of series two
in february that year it had been reported that grade had been unable to sell the series in the united states due to disagreements over timeslots
in july he cancelled thunderbirds after failing in his second attempt to secure an american buyer
the three major us networks of the time – nbc cbs and abc – had all bid for the series with grade repeatedly increasing the price
when nbc withdrew its offer the other two immediately followed
by the time of its cancellation thunderbirds had become widely popular in the uk and was being distributed extensively overseas
grade however believed that without the financial boost of an american network sale a full second series would fail to recover its production costs
he therefore asked anderson to devise a new concept that he hoped would stand a greater chance of winning over the profitable us market
this became captain scarlet and the mysterons
dialogue was recorded once per month at a rate of two scripts per session
supporting parts were not pre @-@ assigned but negotiated by the cast among themselves
two recordings would be made at each session one to be converted into electronic pulses for the puppet filming the other to be added to the soundtrack during post @-@ production
the tapes were edited at gate recording theatre in birmingham
in the interest of transatlantic appeal it was decided that the main characters would be mostly american and therefore actors capable of producing an appropriate accent were used
british canadian and australian actors formed most of the voice cast the only american involved was stage actor david holliday who was noticed in london 's west end and given the part of virgil tracy
following the completion of the first series holliday returned to the us
the character was voiced by english @-@ canadian actor jeremy wilkin for series two
british actor david graham was among the first to be cast
he had previously voiced characters in four feather falls supercar fireball xl5 and stingray
beyond the apf productions he had supplied one of the original dalek voices on doctor who
cast alongside graham was australian actor ray barrett
like graham he had worked for the andersons before having voiced titan and commander shore in stingray
a veteran of radio drama barrett was skilled at performing a range of voices and accents in quick succession
villains of the week would typically be voiced by either barrett or graham
aware of the sensitive political climate of the cold war and not wishing to perpetuate the idea that russia was the enemy with a whole generation of children watching gerry anderson decided the hood voiced by barrett should be oriental and placed his temple hideout in malaysia to defy the viewer 's expectations
although lady penelope and parker the latter voiced by graham were among the first characters developed neither was conceived as a major role
parker 's cockney manner was based on a waiter at a pub in cookham that was sometimes visited by the crew
on gerry anderson 's recommendation graham dined there regularly to study the accent
anderson 's first choice for the role of penelope had been fenella fielding but sylvia insisted she take the part herself
her penelope voice was intended to emulate fielding and joan greenwood
on penelope and parker 's secondary role as comic relief gerry explained we british can laugh at ourselves so therefore we had penelope and parker as this comedy team
and in america they love the british aristocracy too
as well as jeff tracy english @-@ canadian actor peter dyneley voiced the recurring character of commander norman chief of air traffic control at london international airport
his supporting character voices were typically those of upper @-@ class englishmen
shane rimmer the voice of scott was cast on the strength of his performance on the bbc soap opera compact
meanwhile fellow canadian matt zimmerman was selected at a late stage in the process
the expatriate west end actor was given the role of alan on the recommendation of his friend holliday they were having great difficulty casting the part of alan as they wanted a certain sound for him being the youngest brother
david who was a bit older than i am told them that he had this friend me who would be great
christine finn known for her role in the tv serial quatermass and the pit provided the voices of tin @-@ tin kyrano and grandma tracy
with sylvia anderson she was also responsible for voicing most of the female and child supporting characters
other minor parts were voiced by charles tingwell paul maxwell and john tate the father of nick tate who were not credited for their contributions

bob bell assisted by keith wilson and grenville nott headed the art department for series one
during the simultaneous filming of series two and thunderbirds are go in <year> bell attended mainly to the film entrusting set design for the tv series to wilson
since it was necessary for the art department 's interior sets to conform to the effects department 's exterior plans each team closely monitored the other 's work
according to sylvia anderson bell 's challenge was to produce complex interiors on a limited budget while resisting the effects department 's push for more extravagant design
this task was complicated by the unnatural proportions of the puppets bell struggled to decide whether the sets should be built to a scale proportionate to their bodies or their oversized heads and hands
he used the example of fab <num> to illustrate the problem as soon as we positioned the puppets standing alongside the model they looked ridiculous as the car towered over them
he ultimately adopted a mix @-@ and @-@ match approach in which smaller items such as tableware were scaled to their hands and furniture to their bodies
while designing the creighton @-@ ward mansion sets bell and his staff strove for authenticity ordering miniature tudor paintings <num> ⁄ <num> @-@ scale georgian- and regency @-@ style furniture and carpeting in the shape of a polar bear skin
this realism was enhanced by adding scrap items acquired from household waste and electronics shops
for example a vacuum cleaner pipe serves as virgil tracy 's launch chute
glanville 's four @-@ person team built the <num> members of the main cast in six months at a cost of between £ <num> and £ <num> per puppet approximately £ <num> @,@ <num> and £ <num> @,@ <num> today
since pairs of episodes were being filmed simultaneously on separate stages the characters needed to be sculpted in duplicate
facial expressions were diversified by means of replaceable heads as well as a head with a neutral expression each main character was given a smiler a frowner and a blinker
the finished puppets were approximately <num> inches <num> cm tall or <num> ⁄ <num> adult human height
the puppets were made up of more than <num> individual components the most important of which was the solenoid that synchronised lip movements with the characters pre @-@ recorded dialogue
this device was positioned inside the head unit consequently torsos and limbs appeared relatively small
the puppets likenesses and mechanics are remembered favourably by puppeteer wanda brown who preferred the thunderbirds marionettes over the accurately @-@ proportioned ones that first appeared in captain scarlet the puppets were easier to operate and more enjoyable because they had more character to them
even some of the more normal @-@ looking faces such as scott and jeff for me had more character than the puppets in the series that came afterwards
rimmer speaks positively of the puppets still being very much caricatures since it made them more lovable and appealing
there was a naive quality about them and nothing too complex
the appearances of the main characters were inspired by those of actors and other entertainers who were typically selected from the show business directory spotlight
according to glanville as part of a trend away from the strong caricature of previous series apf was seeking more natural faces for the puppets
the face of jeff tracy was based on that of lorne greene scott on sean connery alan on robert reed john on adam faith and charlton heston brains on anthony perkins and parker on ben warriss
sylvia anderson brought the character of penelope to life in likeness as well as voice after her test moulds were rejected sculptor mary turner decided to use anderson herself as a template
terry curtis was also an original sculpture of supermarionation puppets
main character heads were initially sculpted in either plasticine or clay
once the general aspect had been finalised this served as the template for a silicone rubber mould
this was coated with bondaglass fibreglass mixed with resin and enhanced with bondapaste a putty @-@ like substance to accentuate contours
the bondaglass shell was then fitted with a solenoid leather mouth parts and plastic eyes as well as incisor teeth – a first for a supermarionation production
puppets known as revamps which had plastic heads portrayed the supporting characters
these marionettes started their working lives with only a mouth and eyes their faces were remoulded from one episode to the next
particularly striking revamp moulds were retained and as their numbers increased photographed to compile an internal casting directory
wigs were made of mohair or in the case of the penelope puppet human hair
puppet bodies were built in three sizes large male specifically for the tracys and the hood small male and small female
sylvia anderson the head costume designer devised the main characters attire
to give the puppets increased mobility the costume department generally avoided stiff synthetic materials instead working with cotton silk and wool
between <year> and <year> the department 's stock numbered more than <num> costumes
each puppet 's head was fitted with about <num> thin tungsten steel wires
during the filming dialogue was played into the studio using modified tape recorders that converted the feed into electronic pulses
two of the wires relayed these pulses to the internal solenoid completing the supermarionation process
the wires which were sprayed black to reduce their visibility were made even less noticeable through the application of powder paint that matched the background colours of the set
glanville explained the time @-@ consuming nature of this process the puppeteers used to spend over half an hour on each shot getting rid of these wires looking through the camera puffing a bit more paint here anti @-@ flare there and i mean it 's very depressing when somebody will say to us of course the wires showed
positioned on an overhead gantry with a hand @-@ held cruciform the puppeteers co @-@ ordinated movements with the help of a viewfinder @-@ powered cctv feedback system
as filming progressed the crew started to dispense with wires and instead manipulate the puppets from the studio floor using rods
due to their low weight and the fact that they had only one control wire per leg the puppets were unable to walk convincingly
therefore scenes involving movement were filmed from the waist up with a puppeteer holding the legs below the level of the camera and using a bobbing action to simulate motion
alternatively dynamic shots were eliminated altogether in an interview with new scientist director of photography john read spoke of the advantages of circumventing the lack of agility so that the puppets appear for example to walk through doors although the control wires make this impossible or pick up a coffee cup although their fingers are not in fact jointed
live @-@ action shots of human hands were inserted whenever scripts called for more dexterous actions to be performed
knowing that thunderbirds would be the biggest project apf had worked on meddings found himself struggling to manage his workload with the single filming unit that had produced all the effects for stingray
he therefore established a second unit under technician brian johncock and a third exclusively for filming airborne sequences
this expansion increased the number of apf crews and stages to five each
a typical episode contained around <num> effects shots meddings team completed up to <num> per day
an addition to the effects department was mike trim who served as meddings assistant in designing vehicles and buildings
meddings and trim jointly pioneered an organic design technique in which the exteriors of models and sets were customised with parts from model kits and children 's toys
models and sets were also dirtied down with powder paint or pencil lead to create a used look
toy cars and vans were used in long shot while scale vehicles were equipped with basic steering and suspension for added realism
miniature fans and jetex pellets which are capable of issuing air jets or chemical exhaust were attached to the undersides to simulate dust trails
another of meddings inventions was a closed cyclical effects stage nicknamed the rolling road consisting of two or more loops of canvas running at different speeds this device allowed shots of moving vehicles to be filmed on a static set to make more efficient use of the limited studio space
airborne aircraft sequences were mounted against a rolling sky with smoke fanned across to simulate passing clouds
one of meddings first tasks was to shoot stock footage of the thunderbird machines and the series main locations tracy island and creighton @-@ ward mansion
the finished island model was a composite of more than a dozen smaller sets that could be detached from the whole and filmed separately
the architecture of the mansion was based on that of stourhead house located on the stourhead estate in wiltshire
in the absence of head designer reg hill who was serving as associate producer meddings was further tasked with designing the thunderbird fleet and fab <num>
scale models for the six main vehicles were built by a contractor master models of middlesex
models and puppet sets combined more than <num> versions of the thunderbird machines were created for the series
during the designing and filming process meddings first priorities were realism and credibility
with the exception of thunderbird <num> each vehicle was built in three or four scales
meddings swing @-@ wing concept for thunderbird <num> was inspired by his wish to create something more dynamic than a fixed @-@ wing aircraft
he remained unsatisfied with the prototype of thunderbird <num> until he inverted the wings later commenting
at the time all aircraft had swept @-@ back wings
i only did it to be different
this decision was made out of personal preference and was not informed by any expert knowledge on meddings part
he described the thunderbird <num> launch as probably the most memorable sequence that his team devised for an apf production
the largest model of thunderbird <num> whose design was based on the soviet soyuz rocket was six feet <num>
<num> m tall
thunderbird <num> was particularly difficult to film as the scale of the model did not correspond to the water inside the shooting tank creative camera angles and rapid editing were used to produce a sense of realistic perspective
thunderbird <num> the most difficult vehicle for meddings to visualise was based on the tracy island round house
since most of the space station 's appearances were provided by stock footage the model was rarely filmed
pod vehicles were designed on an episode @-@ by @-@ episode basis and built from balsa wood jelutong wood or fibreglass
to save time and costs other minor vehicles were built in @-@ house from radio @-@ controlled model kits
as the puppets of lady penelope and parker needed to fit inside the largest of all the models was the seven @-@ foot fab <num> which cost £ <num> @,@ <num> approximately £ <num> @,@ <num> today to build
the rolls @-@ royce 's name and colour were both chosen by sylvia anderson
rolls @-@ royce ltd
supervised the construction of the plywood model and supplied apf with an authentic radiator grille for close @-@ up shots of the front of the car
in exchange for its cooperation the company requested that a spirit of ecstasy be fixed to the chassis and that the characters avoid referring to the brand with abbreviations such as rolls
scale explosions were created using substances such as fuller 's earth petrol gel magnesium strips and cordtex explosive
originally filmed at up to <num> frames per second f
p
s
they were slowed down to <num> f
p
s
during post @-@ production to increase their apparent magnitude and length
gunpowder canisters were ignited to create rocket jets
the wires that electronically fired the rockets also allowed a member of the crew holding a cruciform and positioned on an overhead gantry to fly the model over the set
by far the most unwieldy model was thunderbird <num> which meddings remembered as being awful to fly
a combination of unreliable rockets and weak wiring frequently caused problems should the former be slow to ignite the current quickly caused the latter to overheat and snap potentially damaging the model and even setting fire to the set
conditions above the studio floor were often dangerous due to the heat and smoke
although many of the exhaust sound effects used in the series were drawn from an audio library some were specially recorded during a red arrows display at raf little rissington in gloucestershire
by <year> meddings commitments were split between series two and thunderbirds are go
while meddings worked on the film camera operator jimmy elliott assumed the responsibility of directing the tv effects
by this stage the basic frame of thunderbird <num> had been damaged so many times that the model had needed to be rebuilt from scratch
meddings was displeased with the result reflecting that the replacement was not only the wrong colour it was a completely different shape
i never felt our model @-@ makers managed to recapture the look of the original
critic david garland suggests that the challenge facing the thunderbirds effects department was to strike a balance between the conventional science @-@ fiction imperative of the futuristic and the seeping hyper @-@ realist concerns mandated by the andersons approach to the puppets
thunderbirds has been praised for the quality of its effects
jim sangster and paul condon writers of collins telly guide consider the model work uniformly impressive
to paul cornell martin day and keith topping writers of the guinness book of classic british tv the effects are way beyond anything seen on tv previously
impressed by their work on thunderbirds film director stanley kubrick hired several members of meddings staff to supervise the effects shooting for <year> a space odyssey
it opens with a countdown of <num> <num> <num> <num> <num> thunderbirds are go provided by dyneley in character as jeff tracy
in a departure from the style of stingray the thunderbirds title sequence varies with each episode the first part consists of an action montage that serves as a preview of the plot
simon archer and marcus hearn biographers of gerry anderson compare this device favourably to a film trailer
the second part accompanied by composer barry gray 's the thunderbirds march features portraits of the main puppet cast superimposed on various vehicles and settings
peel describes this as ostensibly a return to the series stars concept long known in tv while garland considers such imagery demonstrative of anderson 's commitment to incremental realism through a convergence of human and puppet characteristics
essayist jonathan bignell suggests that the use of portraits conveys anderson 's partiality to visual revelation of machines and physical action
according to daniel o 'brien writer of sf uk how british science fiction changed the world the thunderbirds title sequence encapsulates the reasons for the series enduring popularity
dyneley 's countdown is particularly well remembered and has been widely quoted
dean newman of the syfy channel website ranks thunderbirds eighth in a list of top <num> tv title sequences while den of geek 's martin anderson considers the sequence the best of any tv series
in response to gerry anderson 's request that the main theme have a military feel gray produced a brass @-@ dominated piece titled the thunderbirds march which was recorded in december <year> at olympic studios in london
the end titles were originally to have been accompanied by flying high a lyrical track sung by gary miller with backing by ken barrie
ultimately a variation of the march was used instead
incidental music was recorded over nine months between march and december <year>
as most of the music budget was spent on the series earlier episodes later instalments drew heavily on apf 's ever @-@ expanding music library
peel considers the thunderbirds march to be one of the best tv themes ever written – perfect for the show and catchy when heard alone
morag reavley of bbc online argues that the piece is up there
in the quintessential soundtrack of the sixties with the james bond films and the songs of frank sinatra elvis and the beatles
more generally he praises the series catchy pulse @-@ quickening tunes as well as gray 's aptitude for musical nuance and the mixing of genres
heather phares of allmusic considers thunderbirds are go – the track accompanying the launch sequences of thunderbirds <num> <num> and <num> – to be a reflection of the mod aspect of <num> british spy fiction
she also highlights gray 's homage to – and divergence from – musical norms commenting that his score sends up the spy and action adventure conventions of the <num> very stylishly and subtly
david huckvale identifies wagnerian homage in both the theme music and the series premise
noting that the theme 's opening string ostinato is similar in effect to a recurring motif in ride of the valkyries he also likens the thunderbird machines to valkyries themselves their function is more benevolent than those warrior maidens but they do hover over danger death and destruction
kevin j
donnelly of the university of southampton acknowledges the series big @-@ sounding orchestral score which he compares to that of a live @-@ action film
he also suggests that the music serves partly to draw attention away from the physical imperfections of the puppets
to celebrate the shows anniversary thunderbirds are go <num> years on at colston hall bristol was celebrated as the theme music is brought to life led by charles hazlewood and his all star collective

in <year> thunderbirds achieved <num> place in a radio times magazine reader poll to determine the best science @-@ fiction tv programme of all time
it is ranked fourth by the <year> channel <num> list show <num> greatest kids tv shows
for peel thunderbirds is without a doubt the peak of the supermarionation achievement
suggesting that the series is pitched at a more adult level than its predecessors he adds that its sense of adventure effective humour and gripping and convincing episodes ensured that everyone in the audience found something to love about it
simon heffer a fan of thunderbirds in childhood commented positively on the series for the daily telegraph in <year> all the elements we children discerned in whatever grown @-@ up television we had been allowed to watch were present in thunderbirds dramatic theme and incidental music well @-@ developed plots goodies and baddies swaggering americans at a time when the whole of britain was in a cultural cringe to them and of course glamorous locations
then of course there was the nail @-@ biting tension of the rescues themselves
film critic kim newman describes the series as a television perennial
in his foreword to john marriott 's book thunderbirds are go anderson put forward several explanations for the series enduring popularity it contains elements that appeal to most children – danger jeopardy and destruction
but because international rescue 's mission is to save life there is no gratuitous violence
according to anderson thunderbirds incorporates a strong family atmosphere where dad reigns supreme
both o 'brien and script editor alan pattillo have praised the series positive family values
in addition heffer and others have written of its cross @-@ generational appeal
in <year> shortly before the series bbc revival brian viner remarked in radio times that thunderbirds was on the point of captivating yet another generation of viewers
stuart hood writing for the spectator in <year> praised thunderbirds as a modern fairy tale adding that it can sometimes be frightening he recommended that children watch it accompanied by their parents
writing for dreamwatch in <year> andrew thomas described thunderbirds as only nominally a children 's programme its themes are universal and speak as much to the adult in the child as the child in the adult
jeff evans author of the penguin tv companion argues that the series <num> @-@ minute format allows for stronger character development and tension @-@ building
o 'brien is less positive in his appraisal of the writing asserting that the plots are often formulaic and are sometimes stretched to snapping point by the extended running time
cornell day and topping are critical they consider the writing at times woefully poor and argue that thunderbirds as a whole is often as clichéd as previous anderson series
peel despite praising the storylines and characterisation suggests that the tongue @-@ in @-@ cheek humour of stingray is less evident
where thunderbirds improves on its predecessor peel believes is in its rejection of fantasy plot devices child and animal characters comical and stereotyped villains and what he terms the standard anderson sexism female characters marginalised in earlier series are more commonly seen to play active and sometimes heroic roles
noting the attention to detail of the series launch sequences jonathan bignell argues that part of the motivation for dedicating large amounts of screen time to the thunderbird craft is the need to compensate for the limited mobility of the puppet cast
the focus on futuristic machines has also been explored by cultural historian nicholas j
cull who comments that of all the andersons series thunderbirds is the most evocative of a recurring theme the necessity of the human component of the machine whereby the failures of new technology are overcome by brave human beings and technology working together
this makes the series vision of the <num> wonderfully humanistic and reassuring
o 'brien similarly praises this optimism comparing the tracy family to guardian übermensch
writing for wired uk magazine warren ellis asserts that the series scientific vision could inspire the next generation of mad and frightening engineers adding that thunderbirds trades in vast demented concepts
immense and very beautiful ideas as solutions to problems
thomas argues that the world of thunderbirds is similar to the <num> to the extent that contemporary capitalism and class structures appear to have survived mostly intact
he also observes however that wealth and high social status are often depicted as character flaws rather than strengths
according to thomas a contributing factor to the series lasting popularity is the realism of ir 's machines
newman for his part suggests that the point isn 't realism
the 21st century of thunderbirds is detailed
but also de @-@ populated a high @-@ tech toyland
he is more negative in his comparisons of contemporary and future values noting the square almost <num> attitudes to race gender and class
with regard to stereotyping hood comments that he would be happier if villains didn 't seem to be recognisable by their pigmentation
cull by contrast considers the series largely progressive on the subject of race arguing that it rejects negative stereotyping through the use of positive non @-@ white characters such as kyrano and tin @-@ tin
however he deems many of the one @-@ off villains derivative commenting that these characters are typically presented as corrupt businessmen spivs and gangsters familiar from crime films
various commentators – including bignell cull and o 'brien – have also discussed thunderbirds as a product of the cold war era
bignell comments that the hood 's oriental appearance and mysterious powers draw parallels with james bond villains and fears of china operating as a third force antagonistic to the west
cull observes that despite the series focus on the dangers of nuclear technology the thunderbird machines contradict this particular theme in their case an image of technology associated with the threat of cold war mass destruction – the rocket emerging from the hidden silo – was appropriated and deployed to save life rather than to take it
he argues that the series adheres more closely to cultural norms by drawing on the cold war cult of the secret agent whose skills defend the home from enemies unknown noting lady penelope 's role as a spy in addition to two episodes <num> minutes after noon and the man from mi
<num> that are heavily influenced by the james bond novels and film adaptations
the presentation of smoking in thunderbirds was the subject of a study published in the medical journal tobacco control in <year>
despite identifying examples in <num> episodes kate hunt of the university of glasgow concluded that thunderbirds does not actively promote smoking – a view opposed by the roy castle lung cancer foundation rclcf at the time of the series relaunch on bbc <num>
rejecting the rclcf 's proposal that the remastered episodes be edited to digitally erase all visible cigarettes and cigars the bbc stated that the series does not glorify or encourage smoking and described the activity as incidental to the plot

the key in all games starting with fiba 's amendments to its rules in <year> to be first implemented after the <year> fiba world championship is rectangular
prior to <year> the key in fiba @-@ sanctioned tournaments mostly basketball played outside the united states and almost all international tournaments including the world championships and the olympics was trapezoidal in shape
both nba and fiba keys are <num> feet <num>
<num> m wide while ncaa keys are narrower at <num> feet <num>
<num> m
the most @-@ commonly enforced rule on the key is the three seconds rule in which a player from the offensive team is prohibited from staying on the key for more than three seconds or else the player 's team will lose possession of the ball
another rule enforced is the lane violation in which players from both teams are prohibited to enter the lane until after the free throw shooter releases the ball from his hands the shooter is prohibited to enter the key until after the ball hits the rim
an innovation is the introduction of the restricted area arc directly underneath the basket where the defending player cannot force an offensive foul on the opposing player
in addition to the bounding rectangle the key includes a free @-@ throw circle at its head or top
the width of the key in the nba is <num> feet <num>
<num> m including the <num> @-@ foot <num>
<num> m wide foul lanes in u
s
college ncaa and high @-@ school play it is <num> feet <num>
<num> m
beginning after the <year> fiba world championship all fiba @-@ administered tournaments use a rectangular key <num>
<num> meters <num> ft wide
from <year> until <year> fiba @-@ sanctioned tournaments used a trapezoidal key
the narrower end was on the free @-@ throw line where it was <num>
<num> meters <num> ft while the wider end at the end line measured <num> meters <num> ft
the free throw circle has a six @-@ foot <num>
<num> m radius and is centered at the midpoint of the free throw line the half of those circle on the mid @-@ court side of the free throw line is painted in solid lines
in the nba and uleb the boundaries of the half closer to the basket is traced in a broken line in order to space players properly for jump balls
nba rule <num> g requires the key to contain two <num> inches <num> cm long hash marks <num> feet <num>
<num> m from the free throw line the marks indicate the so @-@ called lower defensive box
the free @-@ throw line is <num> feet <num>
<num> m from the perpendicular projection of the face of the backboard onto the court this projection is <num> feet <num>
<num> m from the end @-@ line for nba and ncaa
the projection of the center of the basket onto the court is a perpendicular distance of <num>
<num> meters <num>
<num> ft from the end line in fiba tournaments but <num>
<num> feet <num>
<num> m in nba and ncaa tournaments
<num> m wide hence the key with the free throw circle as the head and the shaded lane as the body
due to the narrowness of the key imposing centers such as george mikan dominated the paint scoring at will
to counter this the key was widened into <num> feet <num>
<num> m from <num> feet <num>
<num> m at the onset of the <year> – <num> nba season
men 's professional basketball in the united states notably the national basketball association widened it further to <num> feet <num>
<num> m in the <year> – <num> nba season to lessen the effectiveness of centers especially wilt chamberlain
the ncaa retains the <num> feet key to this day
on april <num> <year> the fiba central board approved rule changes that included the changes in the shape of the key the key is now rectangular and has virtually the same dimensions as the key used in the nba
in addition the no @-@ charge semicircles formally called the restricted area arc was also created
on all levels a team on the offensive in possession of the ball is prohibited to stay inside the lane for more than three seconds after three seconds the player will be called with a three @-@ second violation which will result in a turnover
in american professional basketball the defending team is also prohibited from staying in the key for more than three seconds unless a player is directly guarding an offensive player
if a player surpasses that time his her team will be charged with a defensive three @-@ second violation which will result in a technical foul where the team with the ball shoots one free throw plus ball possession and a reset of the shot clock
in fiba @-@ sanctioned tournaments on the other hand the defending team is allowed to stay on the key for an unlimited amount of time
in all cases the count resets if the shot hits the rim or if the player steps out of the lane
in most cases the free throw shooter is behind the free throw line while three of his opponents are along the sides of the key one side with two players the other with one
two of his opponents are situated nearest to the basket on both sides while his two teammates are beside the two opponents closest to the basket with the other player from the opposing team situated farthest from the basket
in the u
s
ncaa there are as many as six players along the key with the opposing team allowed to have as many as four players with the same arrangement as in the nba and fiba but with another player facing his teammate farthest to the basket
see photographs to the right
no player along the lane may enter the key until the shot is released the player shooting the free throw and anyone on top of the key should not pass the free throw line until the ball hits the rim
if any of the offensive players violate the rule no points are awarded for the shot and if there are no more shots remaining the ball is given to the defending team
if a defending player is in the lane too soon an extra shot will be awarded regardless of whether the shot was made or missed
note that in fiba play if the shooter commits the violation it is an automatic turnover
if the shot is successful and the shooter does not commit a violation but other players do commit a violation all violations are discarded
if players from the opposing teams enter the key prior to the release of the ball a jump ball would be done to determine who gets the possession of the ball nba or the possession arrow rule for all other levels in fiba play that only applies if the shooter misses since a successful attempt negates all other penalties
in all situations lane violation penalties cannot occur if there are further free throws to be awarded
<num> meters approximately <num>
<num> feet fiba
the area is officially known as the restricted area ra in the nba the restricted area arc in the ncaa and the no @-@ charge semicircles in fiba
its purpose is to stop secondary defenders from taking a position under the basket in an attempt to draw the offensive foul when a player is driving to the basket
if an offensive player drives past his primary defender on the way to the basket and a secondary defender comes over he must establish a legal position outside the ra to draw an offensive foul
if the drive starts inside the lower defensive box ldb – this is the area from the bottom tip of the free throw circle to the end line between the two <num> ’ posted @-@ up marks the secondary defender is legally allowed to be positioned inside the ra
the restricted area also does not apply if the secondary defender jumps in attempting to block the shot the offensive player leads with his leg or knee in an unnatural motion or uses his off arm to prevent the defender from blocking his shot
the ra does not extend from below the backboard to the baseline
therefore if a player drives the baseline and is not attempting to go directly to the rim the ra does not apply
the restricted area arc rule was implemented in ncaa men 's basketball for the <year> – <year> season
the ncaa approved adding a visible restricted @-@ area arc three feet from the center of the basket in division i men ’ s and women ’ s games for <year> – <year> season
the panel delayed implementation of the arc until the <year> @-@ <num> season for divisions ii and iii to allow those schools time to plan and place the restricted @-@ area arc in their home arenas
starting with the <year> @-@ <year> season the ncaa raised the ra arc to four feet from the center of the basket
historically the area of the key where offensive players are prohibited from remaining longer than three seconds has been painted to distinguish the area from the rest of the court hence the phrase points in the paint
the area around the free throw circle 's farthest point from the basket is called the top of the key and several plays revolve around this area such as screens and pick and rolls
in american women 's collegiate basketball and for men until <year> the three @-@ point arc intersects at the top of the key which could translate plays conducted in this area into three @-@ point field goal conversions
the intersection of the free throw line and the free throw lane is referred to as the elbow of the key
it is a fictionalized account of the last days of simón bolívar liberator and leader of gran colombia
first published in <year> the book traces bolívar 's final journey from bogotá to the caribbean coastline of colombia in his attempt to leave south america for exile in europe
in this dictator novel about a continental hero despair sickness and death inevitably win out over love health and life
breaking with the traditional heroic portrayal of bolívar el libertador garcía márquez depicts a pathetic protagonist a prematurely aged man who is physically ill and mentally exhausted
the story explores the labyrinth of bolívar 's life through the narrative of his memories
following the success of others of his works such as one hundred years of solitude and love in the time of cholera garcía márquez decided to write about the great liberator after reading an unfinished novel about bolívar by his friend álvaro mutis
he borrowed the setting — bolívar 's voyage down the magdalena river in <year> — from mutis
after two years of research that encompassed the extensive memoirs of bolívar 's irish aide @-@ de @-@ camp daniel florencio o 'leary as well as numerous other historical documents and consultations with academics garcía márquez published his novel about the last seven months of bolívar 's life
its mixture of genres makes the general in his labyrinth difficult to classify and commentators disagree over where it lies on the scale between novel and historical account
garcía márquez 's insertion of interpretive and fictionalized elements — some dealing with bolívar 's most intimate moments — caused outrage in parts of latin america when the book was released
many prominent latin american figures believed that the novel damaged the reputation of one of the region 's most important historic figures and portrayed a negative image to the outside world
others saw the general in his labyrinth as a tonic for latin american culture and a challenge to the region to deal with its problems
mutis had started writing a book called el último rostro about bolívar 's final voyage along the magdalena river but never finished it
at the time garcía márquez was interested in writing about the magdalena river because he knew the area intimately from his childhood
two years after reading el último rostro garcía márquez asked mutis for his permission to write a book on bolívar 's last voyage
garcía márquez believed that most of the information available on bolívar was one @-@ dimensional no one ever said in bolívar 's biographies that he sang or that he was constipated
but historians don 't say these things because they think they are not important
in the epilogue to the novel garcía márquez writes that he researched the book for two years the task was difficult both because of his lack of experience in conducting historical research and the lack of documentary evidence for the events of the final period of bolívar 's life
garcía márquez researched a wide variety of historical documents including bolívar 's letters <num> @-@ century newspapers and daniel florencio o 'leary 's <num> volumes of memoirs
he engaged the help of various experts among them geographer gladstone oliva historian and fellow colombian eugenio gutiérrez celys who had co @-@ written a book called bolívar día a día with historian fabio puyo and astronomer jorge perezdoval — garcía márquez used an inventory drawn up by perezdoval to describe which nights bolívar spent under a full moon
garcía márquez also worked closely with antonio bolívar goyanes a distant relative of bolívar during the extensive editing of the book
most of spanish america had gained independence by this date only cuba and puerto rico remained under spanish rule
within a few decades of christopher columbus 's landing on the coast of what is now venezuela in <year> south america had been effectively conquered by spain and portugal
by the beginning of the <num> century several factors affected spain 's control over its colonies napoleon 's invasion of spain in <year> the abdication of charles iv ferdinand vii 's renouncement of his right to succeed and the placement of joseph bonaparte on the spanish throne
the colonies were virtually cut off from spain and the american and french revolutions inspired many creoles — american @-@ born descendants of spanish settlers — to take advantage of spanish weakness
as a result latin america was run by independent juntas and colonial self @-@ governments
the early <num> century saw the first attempts at securing liberation from spain which were led in northern south america by bolívar
he and the independence movements won numerous battles in venezuela new granada and present @-@ day ecuador and peru
his dream of uniting the spanish american nations under one central government was almost achieved
however shortly after the south american colonies became independent of spain problems developed in the capitals and civil wars were sparked in some provinces bolívar lost many of his supporters and fell ill
opposition to his presidency continued to increase and in <year> after <num> years of rule he resigned as president of gran colombia
it begins on may <num> <year> in santa fe de bogotá
the general is preparing for his journey towards the port of cartagena de indias intending to leave colombia for europe
following his resignation as president of gran colombia the people of the lands he liberated have now turned against him scrawling anti @-@ bolívar graffiti and throwing waste at him
the general is anxious to move on but has to remind the vice @-@ president @-@ elect general domingo caycedo that he has yet to receive a valid passport to leave the country
the general leaves bogotá with the few officials still faithful to him including his confidante and aide @-@ de @-@ camp josé palacios
at the end of the first chapter the general is referred to by his full title general simón josé antonio de la santísima trinidad bolívar y palacios for the only time in the novel
on the first night of the voyage the general stays at facatativá with his entourage which consists of josé palacios five aides @-@ de @-@ camp his clerks and his dogs
here as throughout the journey that follows the general 's loss of prestige is evident the downturn in his fortunes surprises even the general himself
his unidentified illness has led to his physical deterioration which makes him unrecognizable and his aide @-@ de @-@ camp is constantly mistaken for the liberator
after many delays the general and his party arrive in honda where the governor posada gutiérrez has arranged for three days of fiestas
on his last night in honda the general returns late to camp and finds one of his old friends miranda lyndsay waiting for him
the general recalls that fifteen years ago she had learned of a plot against his life and had saved him
the following morning the general begins the voyage down the magdalena river
both his physical debilitation and pride are evident as he negotiates the slope to the dock he is in need of a sedan chair but refuses to use it
the group stays a night in puerto real where the general claims he sees a woman singing during the night
his aides @-@ de @-@ camp and the watchman conduct a search but they fail to uncover any sign of a woman having been in the vicinity
the general and his entourage arrive at the port of mompox
here they are stopped by police who fail to recognize the general
they ask for his passport but he is unable to produce one
eventually the police discover his identity and escort him into the port
the people still believe him to be the president of gran colombia and prepare banquets in his honor but these festivities are wasted on him due to his lack of strength and appetite
after several days the general and his entourage set off for turbaco
the group spend a sleepless night in barranca nueva before they arrive in turbaco
their original plan was to continue to cartagena the following day but the general is informed that there is no available ship bound for europe from the port and that his passport still has not arrived
while staying in the town he receives a visit from general mariano montilla and a few other friends
the deterioration of his health becomes increasingly evident — one of his visitors describes his face as that of a dead man
in turbaco the general is joined by general daniel florencio o 'leary and receives news of ongoing political machinations joaquín mosquera appointed successor as president of gran colombia has assumed power but his legitimacy is still contested by general rafael urdaneta
the general recalls that his dream began to fall apart on the very day it was realized
the general finally receives his passport and two days later he sets off with his entourage for cartagena and the coast where more receptions are held in his honor
throughout this time he is surrounded by women but is too weak to engage in sexual relations
the general is deeply affected when he hears that his good friend and preferred successor for the presidency field marshal sucre has been ambushed and assassinated
the general is now told by one of his aides @-@ de @-@ camp that general rafael urdaneta has taken over the government in bogotá and there are reports of demonstrations and riots in support of a return to power by bolívar
the general 's group travel to the town of soledad where he stays for more than a month his health declining further
in soledad the general agrees to see a physician for the first time
the general never leaves south america
he finishes his journey in santa marta too weak to continue and with only his doctor and his closest aides by his side
he dies in poverty a shadow of the man who liberated much of the continent
garcía márquez only once names his protagonist as simón bolívar the famous historical figure whose full title was general simón josé antonio de la santísima trinidad bolívar y palacios on whom the general 's character is based
the novel 's portrait of a national and latin american hero which challenges the historical record provoked outrage in some quarters on its publication
at the beginning of the novel the general is <num> years old and slowly dying on his last journey to the port of cartagena de indias where he plans to set sail for europe
as palencia @-@ roth notes bolívar is cast here not only as a victim but as an agent of latin america 's tragic political flaws
the fortunes of the historical simón bolívar began to decline in <year> after the victory of his general antonio josé de sucre at ayacucho
the novel draws on the fact that the historical bolívar never remarried after the death of his wife maría teresa rodríguez del toro y alayza
garcía márquez uses other documented facts as starting points for his fictional portrait of bolívar – for example his dedication to the army above all else his premature aging and his bad temper
of the latter bolívar 's aide @-@ de @-@ camp o 'leary once remarked that his imperious and impatient temperament would never tolerate the smallest delay in the execution of an order
in an interview with maría elvira samper garcía márquez has admitted that his portrayal of bolívar is partly a self @-@ portrait
he identifies with bolívar in many ways since their method of controlling their anger is the same and their philosophical views are similar neither pays much attention to death because that distracts one from the most important thing what one does in life
as literary critic seymour menton observes palacios 's total identification with bolívar constitutes the novel 's frame
palacios constantly waits on the general and at certain times he alone is allowed in the general 's room
he has learned to live with his master 's unpredictability and does not presume to read his thoughts
born a slave the character is six years younger than the general and has spent his entire life in his service
throughout the novel palacios provides the general with clarifications or reminders of dates and events during the general 's time of disillusion
according to one critic palacios 's ability to recall past events in bolívar 's life is essential for garcía márquez 's recreation of the character as it allows the bolívar of official history to be placed within the context of everyday life
her character is based on simón bolívar 's historical mistress doña manuela sáenz de thorne whom bolívar dubbed the liberator of the liberator after she helped save him from an assassination attempt on the night of september <num> <year>
garcía márquez 's fictional portrait stimulated a reassessment of this historical figure who is increasingly seen according to venezuelan historian denzil romero not just as a mistress but as the intelligent independent forceful woman she was
in the novel she is described as the bold quiteña who loved him but was not going to follow him to his death
the general leaves manuela sáenz behind but throughout the novel he writes to her on his journey
she also attempts to write letters to him with news of the political situation but the mail carriers have been instructed not to accept her letters
like the historical figure on whom she is based the fictional manuela sáenz is married to dr
james thorne an english physician twice her age
the historical manuela sáenz left thorne after bolívar wrote declaring his undying love for her
in the novel she is characterized as astute and indomitable with irresistible grace a sense of power and unbounded tenacity
the historical francisco de paula santander was a friend of simón bolívar but was later accused of complicity in a plot to assassinate him and sent into exile
in the novel the general remembers that he had once appointed santander to govern colombia because he believed him to be an effective and brave soldier
he formerly regarded santander as his other self and perhaps his better self but by the time of the events in the general in his labyrinth santander has become the general 's enemy and has been banished to paris after his involvement in the assassination attempt
the general is depicted as tormented by the idea that santander will return from his exile in france he dreams for example that santander is eating the pages of a book that he is covered in cockroaches and that he is plucking out his own eyeballs
the historical antonio josé de sucre the field marshal of ayacucho had been the most trusted general of simón bolívar
garcía márquez describes him as intelligent methodical shy and superstitious
the field marshal is married to and has a daughter with doña mariana carcelén
in the first chapter of the novel the general asks sucre to succeed him as president of the republic but he rejects the idea
one of the reasons sucre gives is that he wishes only to live his life for his family
also at the beginning of the novel sucre 's death is foreshadowed
sucre tells the general that he plans on celebrating the feast of saint anthony in quito with his family
when the general hears that sucre has been assassinated in berruecos on his way back to quito he vomits blood
sometimes they are identified by particular quirks or tied to small but significant events
they include for instance general josé maría carreño a member of the entourage whose right arm was amputated after a combat wound and who once revealed a military secret by talking in his sleep
at other times they are prostheses for the general 's now failing powers fernando for example the general 's nephew is the most willing and patient of the general 's many clerks and the general wakes him at any hour to have him read aloud from a dull book or take notes on urgent extemporizations
one of the least developed of the minor characters is the general 's wife maría teresa rodríguez del toro y alayza who had died readers are told in mysterious circumstances shortly after their marriage
the general has buried her at the bottom of a water @-@ tight oblivion as a brutal means of living without her she only fleetingly enters his memories in the book 's last chapter
according to menton she is upstaged by manuela sáenz whose later history garcía márquez recounts as if she instead were the general 's widow
maría teresa 's death however marked the general 's birth into history and he has never tried to replace her
for example alvarez borland points out that in the scene where the general responds to the french diplomat his words closely reflect garcía márquez 's <year> nobel address
the diplomat is critical of the barbarism in latin america and the brutal means used in attempting to achieve independence
bolívar replies by pointing out that europe had centuries to progress to its current state and that south america should be left to experience its middle ages in peace
similarly garcía márquez remarks in his nobel speech that venerable europe would perhaps be more perceptive if it tried to see latin america in its own past
if only it recalled that london took three hundred years to build its first city wall

the novel was published in <year> when the soviet union was disintegrating and the political map was being radically redrawn
reviewing the general in his labyrinth in <year> the novelist margaret atwood pointed to another instance of garcía márquez raising political issues through the character of the general
he has him tell his aide that the united states is omnipotent and terrible and that its tale of liberty will end in a plague of miseries for us all
atwood noted the contemporary relevance of this sentiment since the patterns of latin american politics and of united states intervention in them have not changed much in <num> years
she suggested that garcía márquez 's fictionalization of bolívar is a lesson for our own turbulent age
revolutions have a long history of eating their progenitors
the central character is a man at the end of his life who has seen his revolution and dream of a united latin america fail
that consistently and conclusively result in a dead end — in this case the general 's own death
his final voyage along the magdalena river involves a doubling back and forth from one location to another that leads him and his followers nowhere
the labyrinth does not lead to happiness instead it results in madness from constant pondering on the past and an impossible future
at the end of his life the general is reduced to a spectre of his former self
the labyrinth also recalls the labyrinth built to imprison the minotaur in greek mythology and the endless travelling and searching of ancient greek heroes
in danow 's view the labyrinth mirrors the wanderings and travails of the hero in search for meaning and resolution to the vicissitudes of life
garcía márquez depicts the general 's body itself as a labyrinth
his doctor observes that everything that enters the body adds weight and everything that leaves it is debased
the general 's body is described as a labyrinth coming to a literal dead end
the labyrinth is also expressed in geographical and architectural imagery
the country 's destiny is imagined as a break @-@ up a folding of north into south
the seas offer the hope of a new life and a new world but the closer the general is to colombia the less chance he has of moving on
garcía márquez describes buildings as daunting reverberating if not exactly reiterating with the echoes of a bloody past
the portrayal of the general 's world as a labyrinth is underlined by his constant return to cities and towns he has visited before each location belongs to the past as well as to the present
the general in his labyrinth blurs the lines between perdition in a man @-@ made world and wandering in the natural world
for instance a clock stuck at seven minutes past one the exact time of the general 's death appears repeatedly in the novel
this sense of fate is introduced in the epigraph which comes from a letter written by the historical bolívar to general santander on august <num> <year> it seems that the devil controls the business of my life
as palencia @-@ roth points out the word used for devil here is demonio rather than the more familiar diablo
demonio derives from the greek word daimon which can equally mean divine power fate or destiny
accordingly the general succumbs to his fate and accepts his death as destiny
the theme of love is central to the novel
bolívar had a reputation as a womanizer and books have been written on his philandering but as depicted in this novel during the last seven months of his life the general could no longer engage in the activities that had fueled that reputation
garcía márquez mentions a woman every few pages many of whom are his own invention exploring love through the general 's memories
palencia @-@ roth notes that the presence of these women allows a labyrinthine exploration of his life before his final journey and suggests that garcía márquez uses love as a barometer of the general 's heart and health
although bolívar is usually thought to have died from tuberculosis palencia @-@ roth believes that for the author the general dies from the lack of love
despised by many of his countrymen abandoned by all but a few aides and associates left — during the final seven months of his life — without even the companionship of his longtime mistress manuela saenz bolívar had no choice but to die of a broken heart
the book is divided into eight chapters almost all of equal length which represent the eight @-@ year love affair between the general and manuela sáenz
the general 's last hours are marked by an octagonal clock
allusions to the number three are even more common in the novel
as garcía márquez scholar isabel rodríguez vergara notes the number three — the trinity which occupies a vital place in the symbology of the catholic mass — is repeated <num> times throughout the book
she quotes mircea eliade in the novel it represents a symbolic sacrifice aimed at redeeming humankind — that of bolívar a misunderstood redeemer sacrificed by his own people
rodríguez vergara observes that the general is like a supernatural being simultaneously dying and being surrounded by symbolic circumstances such as rain fiestas and the plague
the novel begins with bolívar immersed in purifying waters in a state of ecstasy and meditation that suggests a priestly ritual
one of the women with whom the general sleeps queen marie louise is described as a virgin with the profile of an idol — an allusion to the virgin mary
the general rides a mule into the last towns on his journey towards death echoing christ 's entry into jerusalem
he dies of mysterious and unknown causes and the people burn his belongings in fear of catching his illness
in rodríguez vergara 's view bolívar was sacrificed as a scapegoat to purge the guilt of the community
rené girard has interpreted the recurrence of rain in the novel as one of the purifying rituals the community must undergo in order to wash away the contagion of violence
the fiestas may represent another ritual of purification and also symbolize war
fiestas are held to honour the general when he arrives at a town but at other times political demonstrations against the general are mistaken for a fiesta
according to rodríguez vergara this shows how information is manipulated and depicts an atmosphere where fiesta and war are synonymous
alonso drawing on freudian theory argues that the novel is essentially a therapeutic device designed to help move latin america past its problematic experience of modernity
he compares this to the way the healing state of mourning replaces grief in the process of recovering from a death
both activities are mechanisms for dealing with loss
alonso believes that the general in his labyrinth by almost entirely centering the novel on the general 's death forces the reader to confront the horror of this process
in alonso 's view the reader is meant to pass from a melancholy relationship vis @-@ a @-@ vis the figure of bolívar to a relationship that has the therapeutic qualities of mourning instead
latin america 's history and culture alonso suggests began with the loss of bolívar 's dream of a united continent and as a result has developed under a melancholy shadow ever since
thus by forcing the reader to return to the origin of modernity in latin america and confront its death in the most horrific way garcía márquez compels the reader to move from melancholy to mourning so that the phantom of the lost object of modernity may cease to rule the libidinal economy of spanish american cultural discourse and historical life
the novel recreates a time in bolívar 's life that has no historical precedent as there is no record of the last <num> days of his life
in garcía márquez 's account readers observe bolívar intimately seeing his human qualities
in the view of critic isabel alvarez borland by choosing to fictionalize a national hero in this way garcía márquez is challenging the claim of official history to represent the truth
in the my thanks section of the novel garcía márquez asserts ironically that what he is writing is more historical than fictional and he discusses his own historical methodology in detail
by posing in the role of a historian he challenges the reliability of written history from within the writing process
according to alvarez borland this serves to remind us that a claim to truth is not the property of any text rather it is the result of how a historian as a reader interprets the facts
the general in his labyrinth also confronts the methods of official historians by using an oral style of narration
the narration can be considered an oral account in that it is woven from the verbal interactions of everyday people
alvarez borland explains that the advantage of this technique as discussed by walter ong is that the orality of any given culture residing in the unwritten tales of its peoples possesses a spontaneity and liveliness which is lost once this culture commits its tales to writing
the oral style of narration therefore provides a truthfulness which official history lacks
alvarez borland concludes that the general in his labyrinth suggests new ways of writing the past it takes account of voices that were never written down as part of official history
the historian ben hughes commented on the novel the liberator 's british confidants including daniel o 'leary were amongst the closest figures to the general in this period
nevertheless they are ignored in the novel
instead márquez uses the character of a fictional colombian servant josé palacios as the liberator 's final sounding board thereby neatly sidestepping the more complex reality
in hughes 's view modern south american literature has played a role in cleansing the national memory of british soldiers assistance to the liberator
palencia @-@ roth suggests that this novel is a labyrinthine summation
of garcía márquez 's long @-@ standing obsessions and ever @-@ present topics love death solitude power fate
like the patriarch in garcía márquez 's the autumn of the patriarch bolívar was an absolute dictator
the patriarch is never identified by name bolívar too is identified chiefly by his title
bolívar also invites comparison with colonel aureliano buendía in one hundred years of solitude both characters believe the wars they have waged have been fruitless and overwhelming and both face numerous attempts on their lives but eventually die of natural causes
in his belief that life is controlled by fate the general resembles buendía in one hundred years of solitude and santiago nasar in chronicle of a death foretold
palencia @-@ roth notes that critics have been struck by the humorless elegiac style of the general in his labyrinth its dark mood and somber message is similar to that of the autumn of the patriarch
love is a theme common to both love in the time of cholera and the general in his labyrinth but the latter is considered a tragedy
these two novels have been used to demonstrate the range of garcía márquez 's work
isabel alvarez borland in her essay the task of the historian in el general en su laberinto claims that
while el general en su laberinto is in many ways a continuation of garcía márquez 's criticism of latin america 's official history seen in his earlier works the novel contrasts sharply with his previous fictions
in chronicle of a death foretold according to alvarez borland the narrator challenges the truth of official language
however the general in his labyrinth differs from these earlier works in employing narrative strategies which seek to answer in a much more overt and didactic fashion questions that the novel poses about history
in a summary of edward hood 's book la ficcion de gabriel garcía márquez repetición e intertextualidad garcía márquez is characterized as an author who uses repetition and autointertextualidad intertextuality between the works of a single author extensively in his fiction including in the general in his labyrinth
hood points out some obvious examples of repetition in garcía márquez 's works the themes of solitude in one hundred years of solitude tyranny in autumn of the patriarch and the desire for a unified continent expressed by bolívar in the general in his labyrinth
an example of intertextuality can be seen in the repetition of patterns between books
for example both jose arcadio buendia in one hundred years of solitude and bolívar in the general in his labyrinth experience labyrinthian dreams
in his review of the general in his labyrinth selden rodman hesitated to call it a novel since it was so heavily researched giving bolívar 's views on everything from life and love to his chronic constipation and dislike of tobacco smoke
on the other hand reviewer robert adams suggested that garcía márquez had improved on history
according to critic donald l
shaw the general in his labyrinth is a new historical novel a genre that he argues crosses between boom post @-@ boom and postmodernist fiction in latin american literature new historical novels tend either to retell historical events from an unconventional perspective but one which preserves their intelligibility or to question the very possibility of making sense of the past at all
shaw believes that this novel belongs to the first category
garcía márquez is presenting both a historical account and his own interpretation of events
david bushnell writing in the hispanic american historical review points out that the work is less a pure historical account than others suggest
garcía márquez 's bolívar is a man who wanders naked through the house suffers constipation uses foul language and much more besides
he argues that documentation does not support many of these details
bushnell suggests however that the fact that the novel is not entirely historically accurate does not necessarily distinguish it from the work of professional historians
the main difference bushnell believes is that garcía márquez 's work is far more readable than a pure history
critic ilan stavans who himself praised the book as one of the writer 's most sophisticated and accomplished attributes this to the novel 's time period and to its profusion of historical information neither of which proved attractive to english @-@ speaking readers
isabel alvarez borland notes that like stavans critics in the united states have largely celebrated garcía márquez 's portrait of this national hero and considered it a tour de force but she also observes that in latin america the book received more mixed reviews ranging from outrage to unqualified praise
the novel generated huge controversy in latin america some venezuelan and colombian politicians described its depiction of bolívar as profane
according to stavans they accused garcía márquez of defaming the larger @-@ than @-@ life reputation of a historical figure who during the nineteenth century struggled to unite the vast hispanic world
the novel 's publication provoked outrage from many latin american politicians and intellectuals because its portrayal of the general is not the saintly image long cherished by many
mexico 's ambassador to austria francisco cuevas cancino wrote a damning letter which was widely publicized in mexico city objecting to the portrayal of bolívar
he stated the novel is plagued with errors of fact conception fairness understanding of the historical moment and ignorance of its consequences
it has served the enemies of latin america who care only that they can now denigrate bolívar and with him all of us
even the novel 's admirers such as the leading venezuelan diplomat and writer arturo uslar pietri worried that some facts were stretched
garcía márquez believes however that latin america has to discover the general 's labyrinth to recognize and deal with its own maze of problems
more positively nelson bocaranda a venezuelan tv commentator considers the novel to be a tonic for latin american culture people here saw a bolívar who is a man of flesh and bones just like themselves
mexican author carlos fuentes agrees with bocaranda saying what comes across beautifully and poignantly in this book is a man dealing with the unknown world of democratic ideas
garcía márquez realistically portrays a ridiculous figure trapped in a labyrinth magnifying the general 's defects and presenting an image of bolívar contrary to that instilled in classrooms
however the novel also depicts bolívar as an idealist and political theorist who predicted many problems that would obstruct latin american advancement in the future
garcía márquez depicts a figure who was aware of the racial and social friction in latin american society feared debt and warned against economic irresponsibility
he has the general warn his aide @-@ de @-@ camp agustín de iturbide against the future interference of the united states in the internal affairs of latin america
novelist and critic barbara mujica comments that the book 's english translator edith grossman fully captures the multiple levels of meaning of the text as well as garcía márquez 's modulations in tone
garcía márquez himself has admitted that he prefers his novels in their english translations
the first american edition was listed as a best seller in the new york times the following year

etty had been planning the painting since <year> – <num> and an early version was exhibited in <year>
the piece was inspired by a metaphor in thomas gray 's poem the bard in which the apparently bright start to the notorious misrule of richard ii of england was compared to a gilded ship whose occupants are unaware of an approaching storm
etty chose to illustrate gray 's lines literally depicting a golden boat filled with and surrounded by nude and near @-@ nude figures
etty felt that his approach to the work illustrated a moral warning about the pursuit of pleasure but his approach was not entirely successful
the bard was about a supposed curse on the house of plantagenet placed by a welsh bard following edward i of england 's attempts to eradicate welsh culture and critics felt that etty had somewhat misunderstood the point of gray 's poem
some reviewers greatly praised the piece and in particular etty 's technical abilities but audiences of the time found it hard to understand the purpose of etty 's painting and his use of nude figures led some critics to consider the work tasteless and offensive
the painting was bought in <year> by robert vernon to form part of his collection of british art
vernon donated his collection including youth on the prow and pleasure at the helm to the national gallery in <year> which in turn transferred it to the tate gallery in <year>
it remains one of etty 's best @-@ known works and formed part of major exhibitions at tate britain in <year> – <num> and at the york art gallery in <year> – <num>
on completing his seven @-@ year apprenticeship at the age of <num> he moved to london with a few pieces of chalk crayons and the intention of becoming a history painter in the tradition of the old masters
he enrolled in the schools of the royal academy of arts studying under renowned portrait painter thomas lawrence
he submitted numerous paintings to the royal academy over the following decade all of which were either rejected or received little attention when exhibited
in <year> etty 's the arrival of cleopatra in cilicia also known as the triumph of cleopatra was a critical success
the painting featured nude figures and over the following years etty painted further nudes in biblical literary and mythological settings
all but one of the <num> paintings etty exhibited in the <num> included at least one nude figure
while some nudes existed in private collections england had no tradition of nude painting and the display and distribution of nude material to the public had been suppressed since the <year> proclamation for the discouragement of vice
etty was the first british artist to specialise in the nude and the reaction of the lower classes to these paintings caused concern throughout the <num> century
although his portraits of male nudes were generally well received many critics condemned his repeated depictions of female nudity as indecent
the theme of the bard was the english king edward i 's conquest of wales and a curse placed by a welsh bard upon edward 's descendants after he ordered the execution of all bards and the eradication of welsh culture
etty used a passage gray intended to symbolise the seemingly bright start to the disastrous reign of edward 's great @-@ great @-@ grandson richard ii
etty chose to illustrate gray 's words literally creating what has been described as a poetic romance
youth and pleasure depicts a small gilded boat
above the boat a nude figure representing zephyr blows on the sails
another nude representing pleasure lies on a large bouquet of flowers loosely holding the helm of the boat and allowing zephyr 's breeze to guide it
a nude child blows bubbles which another nude on the prow of the ship representing youth reaches to catch
naiads again nude swim around and clamber on the boat
although the seas are calm a sweeping whirlwind is forming on the horizon with a demonic figure within the storm clouds
deterioration and restoration means this demonic figure is now barely visible
the intertwined limbs of the participants were intended to evoke the sensation of transient and passing pleasure and to express the themes of female sexual appetites entrapping innocent youth and the sexual power women hold over men
etty said of his approach to the text that he was hoping to create a general allegory of human life its empty vain pleasures — if not founded on the laws of him who is the rock of ages
while etty felt that the work conveyed a clear moral warning about the pursuit of pleasure this lesson was largely lost upon its audiences
when etty exhibited the completed painting at the royal academy summer exhibition in <year> it was shown untitled with the relevant six lines from the bard attached writers at the time sometimes referred to it by its incipit of fair laughs the morn
by the time of etty 's death in <year> it had acquired its present title of youth on the prow and pleasure at the helm
in <year> he had exhibited an early version at the british institution titled a sketch from one of gray 's odes youth on the prow in this version the group of figures on the prow is reversed and the swimmers around the boat are absent
another rough version of the painting also survives similar to the <year> version but again with the figures on the prow reversed
this version was exhibited at a retrospective of etty 's work at the society of arts in <year> it is dated <year> but this is likely to be a misprint of <year> making it a preliminary study for the <year> painting
although it received little notice when first exhibited the <year> version provoked a strong reaction from the times we take this opportunity of advising mr
etty who got some reputation for painting cleopatra 's galley not to be seduced into a style which can gratify only the most vicious taste
naked figures when painted with the purity of raphael may be endured but nakedness without purity is offensive and indecent and on mr
etty 's canvass is mere dirty flesh
mr
howard whose poetical subjects sometimes require naked figures never disgusts the eye or mind
let mr
etty strive to acquire a taste equally pure he should know that just delicate taste and pure moral sense are synonymous terms
an oil sketch attributed to etty given to york art gallery in <year> by judith hare countess of listowel and entitled three female nudes is possibly a preliminary study by etty for youth and pleasure or a copy by a student of the three central figures
art historian sarah burnage considers both possibilities unlikely as neither the arrangement of figures the subject matter or the sea serpent approaching the group appear to relate to the completed youth and pleasure and considers it more likely to be a preliminary sketch for a now @-@ unknown work
the library of the fine arts felt in classical design anatomical drawing elegance of attitude fineness of form and gracefulness of grouping no doubt mr
etty has no superior and while the representation of the ideas in the lines quoted from the bard are beautifully and accurately expressed upon the canvas they considered the ulterior reference of the poet to the destruction of welsh culture and the decline of the house of plantagenet was entirely lost sight of and that if this be the nearest that art can approach in conveying to the eye the happy exemplification of the subject which gray intended we fear we must give up the contest upon the merits of poetry and painting
similar concerns were raised in the times which observed that it was full of beauty rich in colouring boldly and accurately drawn and composed with a most graceful fancy but the meaning of it if it has any meaning no man can tell pointing out that although it was intended to illustrate gray it would represent almost as well any other poet 's fancies
the examiner meanwhile took issue with the cramped and overladen boat pointing out that the characters if not exactly jammed together like figs in a basket are sadly constrained for want of room and also complained that the boat would not in reality float half the weight which is made to press upon it
other reviewers were kinder the gentleman 's magazine praised etty 's ability to capture the beauty of the proportion of the antique noting that in the central figures there is far more of classicality than is to be seen in almost any modern picture and considered the overall composition a most fortunate combination of the ideality of poetry and the reality of nature
the athenæum considered it a poetic picture from a very poetic passage praising etty for telling a story which is very difficult to tell with the pencil
the greatest criticism of youth and pleasure came from the morning chronicle a newspaper which had long disliked etty 's female nudes
it complained no decent family can hang such sights against their wall and condemned the painting as an indulgence of what we once hoped a classical but which are now convinced is a lascivious mind commenting the course of etty 's studies should run in a purer channel and that he should not persist with an unhallowed fancy to pursue nature to her holy recesses
he is a laborious draughtsman and a beautiful colourist but he has not taste or chastity of mind enough to venture on the naked truth
the reviewer added we fear that mr
e will never turn from his wicked ways and make himself fit for decent company
the price vernon paid for youth and pleasure is not recorded although etty 's cashbook records a partial payment of £ <num> — about £ <num> @,@ <num> in <year> terms — so it is likely to have been a substantial sum
vernon later purchased john constable 's the valley farm planning to hang it in the place then occupied by youth and pleasure
this decision caused constable to comment my picture is to go into the place — where etty 's bumboat is at present — his picture with its precious freight is to be brought down nearer to the nose
vernon presented his collection to the nation in <year> and his <num> paintings including youth and pleasure entered the national gallery
when samuel carter hall was choosing works to illustrate his newly launched the art journal he considered it important to promote new british artists even if it meant illustrations which some readers considered pornographic or offensive
in <year> hall secured reproduction rights to the paintings vernon had given to the nation and soon published and widely distributed an engraving of the painting under the title youth and pleasure describing it as of the very highest class
needled by repeated attacks from the press on his supposed indecency poor taste and lack of creativity etty changed his approach after the response to youth on the prow and pleasure at the helm
he exhibited over <num> further paintings at the royal academy alone and remained a prominent painter of nudes but from this time made conscious efforts to reflect moral lessons
he died in november <year> and while his work enjoyed a brief boom in popularity interest in him declined over time and by the end of the <num> century all of his paintings had fallen below their original prices
in <year> the painting was transferred from the national gallery to the tate gallery where as of <year> it remains
although youth and pleasure is one of etty 's best @-@ known paintings it remains controversial and dennis farr 's <year> biography of etty describes it as singularly inept
it was one of four works by etty chosen for tate britain 's landmark exposed the victorian nude exhibition in <year> – <num> and also formed part of a major retrospective of etty 's work at the york art gallery in <year> – <num>
the war officially started on september <num> <year> and ended with a ceasefire on september <num> <year> resulting in a negotiated independence in <year>
portugal 's wars against independence guerrilla fighters in its <num> @-@ year @-@ old african territories began in <year> with angola
in mozambique the conflict erupted in <year> as a result of unrest and frustration amongst many indigenous mozambican populations who perceived foreign rule to be a form of exploitation and mistreatment which served only to further portuguese economic interests in the region
many mozambicans also resented portugal 's policies towards indigenous people which resulted in discrimination traditional lifestyle turning difficult for many africans and limited access to portuguese @-@ style education and skilled employment
as successful self @-@ determination movements spread throughout africa after world war ii many mozambicans became progressively nationalistic in outlook and increasingly frustrated by the nation 's continued subservience to foreign rule
for the other side many enculturated indigenous africans who were fully integrated into the portugal @-@ ruled social organization of portuguese mozambique in particular those from the urban centres reacted to the independentist claims with a mixture of discomfort and suspicion
the ethnic portuguese of the territory which included most of the ruling authorities responded with increased military presence and fast @-@ paced development projects
a mass exile of mozambique 's political intelligentsia to neighbouring countries provided havens from which radical mozambicans could plan actions and foment political unrest in their homeland
the formation of the mozambican guerrilla organisation frelimo and the support of the soviet union china cuba yugoslavia bulgaria tanzania zambia egypt algeria and gaddafi regime in libya through arms and advisers led to the outbreak of violence that was to last over a decade
from a military standpoint the portuguese regular army held the upper hand during the conflict against the independentist guerrilla forces
nonetheless mozambique succeeded in achieving independence on june <num> <year> after a civil resistance movement known as the carnation revolution backed by portions of the military in portugal overthrow the military dictatorship sponsored by us thus ending <num> years of portuguese colonial rule in the east african region
according to historians of the revolution the military coup in portugal was in part fuelled by protests concerning the conduct of portuguese troops in their treatment of some local mozambican populace
the role of the growing communist influence over the group of portuguese military insurgents who led the lisbon 's military coup and on the other hand the pressure of the international community over the direction of the portuguese colonial war in general were main causes for the final outcome
in <year> portuguese explorers landed on the mozambican coastline
portugal 's influence in east africa grew throughout the <num> century she established several colonies known collectively as portuguese east africa
slavery and gold became profitable for the europeans influence was largely exercised through individual settlers and there was no centralised administration and in the meantime portugal had turned her attention to india and brazil
by the <num> century european colonialism in africa had reached its height
having lost control of the vast territory of brazil in south america the portuguese began to focus on expanding their african outposts
this brought them into direct conflict with the british
since david livingstone had returned to the area in <year> in an attempt to foster trade routes british interest in mozambique had risen alarming the portuguese government
during the <num> century much of eastern africa was still being brought under british control and in order to facilitate this britain required several concessions from the portuguese colony
as a result in an attempt to avoid a naval conflict with the superior british royal navy portugal adjusted the borders of her colony and the modern borders of mozambique were established in may <year>
control of mozambique was left to various organisations such as the mozambique company the zambezi company and the niassa company which were financed and provided with cheap labour by the british empire to work mines and construct railways
these companies penetrated inland from the coastline setting up plantations and taxing the local populace who had until then resisted encroachment by the colonists
the resisting gaza empire a collection of indigenous tribes who inhabited the area that now constitutes mozambique and zimbabwe was defeated in <year> and the remaining inland tribes were eventually defeated by <year> in that same year portugal established lourenço marques as the capital
in <year> political and economic crisis in portugal led to the establishment of the second republic later to become the estado novo and a revival of interest in the african colonies
calls for self determination in mozambique arose shortly after world war ii in light of the independence granted to many other colonies worldwide in the great wave of decolonisation
it was called the overseas province of mozambique província ultramarina de moçambique
nonetheless portugal still maintained strong control over its overseas province
the increasing number of newly independent african nations after world war ii coupled with the ongoing mistreatment of the indigenous population encouraged the growth of nationalist sentiments within mozambique
mozambique was marked by large disparities between the wealthy portuguese and the majority of the large rural indigenous african population
poorer whites many of them recent immigrants including illiterate peasants were given preference in lower @-@ level urban jobs where a system of job reservation existed
in the rural areas portuguese controlled the trading stores with which african peasants interacted
being largely illiterate and preserving their local traditions and ways of life skilled employment opportunities and roles in administration and government were rare for these numerous tribal populations leaving them few or no opportunities in the urban modern life
many indigenous peoples saw their culture and tradition being overwhelmed by the alien culture of portugal
a small educated african class did emerge but faced substantial discrimination
vocal political dissidents opposed to portuguese rule and claiming independence were typically forced into exile
from the mid @-@ <num> a succession of authoritarian regimes in portugal closed unions and left @-@ wing opposition both within portugal and within its colonies notably in the estado novo period <year> @-@ <year>
the portuguese government forced black mozambican farmers to grow rice or cotton for export providing little return with which the farmers could support themselves
many other workers — over <num> @,@ <num> by <year> — were pressured to work on coal and gold mines in neighbouring territories mainly in south africa where they comprised over <num> of black underground miners
by <year> only <num> @,@ <num> mozambicans out of <num> @,@ <num> @,@ <num> had been granted the right to vote by the portuguese colonial government
the rift between portuguese settlers and mozambican locals is illustrated in one way by the small number of people with mixed portuguese and mozambican heritage mestiço numbering only <num> @,@ <num> in a population of <num> – <num> million in <year> according to that year 's census
the mozambique liberation front or frelimo frente de libertação de moçambique formally marxist @-@ leninist as of <year> but adherent to such positions since the late <num> was formed in dar es salaam the largest city in neighbouring tanzania on june <num> <year>
it was created during a conference by political figures who had been forced into exile by the merging of various existing nationalist groups including the mozambican african national union national african union of independent mozambique and the national democratic union of mozambique which had been formed two years earlier
it was only in exile that such political movements could develop due to the strength of portugal 's grip on dissident activity within mozambique itself
a year later in <year> frelimo set up headquarters in dar es salaam tanzania under the leadership of sociologist eduardo mondlane and began to call for independence from portugal
after two years of organisation and failing political manoeuvres in an attempt to seek a peaceful independence mondlane began in <year> a campaign of guerrilla warfare in an attempt to achieve independence for mozambique
the united nations also put pressure on portugal to move for decolonisation
portugal threatened to withdraw from nato which put a stop to this support and pressure and the nationalist groups in mozambique were forced to turn to help from the soviet bloc
nikita khrushchev in particular viewed the underdeveloped third of mankind as a means to weaken the west
for the soviets africa represented a chance to create a rift between western powers and their colonial assets and create pro @-@ communist states in africa with which to foster future relations
prior to the formation of frelimo the soviet position regarding the nationalist movements in mozambique was one of confusion
there were multiple independence movements and they had no sure knowledge that any would succeed
the nationalist groups in mozambique like those across africa during the period received training and equipment from the soviet union
eduardo mondlane 's successor future president of mozambique samora machel acknowledged assistance from both moscow and peking describing them as the only ones who will really help us
they have fought armed struggles and whatever they have learned that is relevant to mozambique we will use
guerrillas received tuition in subversion and political warfare as well as military aid specifically shipments of <num> mm artillery rockets in <year> with <year> advisors from russia cuba and east germany
frelimo adopted marxism @-@ leninism at an early stage
the soviet union continued to support the new frelimo government against counterrevolution in the years after <year>
by <year> there were <num> soviet close to <num> cuban military and over <num> civilian cuban advisers still in the country
cuba 's involvement in mozambique was as part of a continuing effort to export the anti @-@ imperialist ideology of the cuban revolution and forge desperately needed new allies
cuba provided support to liberation movements and leftist governments in numerous african countries including angola ethiopia guinea @-@ bissau and congo @-@ brazzaville
their hopes rested on urging the local populace to support the insurgency in order to force a negotiated independence from lisbon
portugal fought its own version of protracted warfare and a large military force was sent by the portuguese government to quell the unrest with troop numbers rising from <num> @,@ <num> to <num> @,@ <num> between <year> and <year>
the number of local soldiers recruited for the portuguese cause rose to <num> @,@ <num> in the same period
<num> special forces operatives were also being trained in commando instruction centres by <year>
the military wing of frelimo was commanded by filipe samuel magaia whose forces received training from algeria
the frelimo guerrillas were armed with a variety of weapons many provided by the soviet union and china
common weapons included the mosin – nagant bolt @-@ action rifle sks and ak @-@ <num> automatic rifles and the soviet ppsh @-@ <num>
machine guns such as the degtyarev light machine gun were widely used along with the dshk and the sg @-@ <num> gorunov
frelimo were supported by mortars recoilless rifles rpg @-@ <num> and rpg @-@ <num> anti @-@ aircraft weapons such as the zpu @-@ <num> and from <year> the strela <num>
in the dying stages of the conflict frelimo was provided with a few sa @-@ <num> manpad shoulder @-@ launched missile launchers from china these were never used to shoot down a portuguese plane
only one portuguese aircraft was lost in combat during the conflict when lt
emilio lourenço 's g
91r @-@ <num> was destroyed by premature detonation of his own ordnance
the portuguese forces were under the command of general antónio augusto dos santos a man with strong faith in new counter @-@ insurgency theories
augusto dos santos supported a collaboration with rhodesia to create african scout units and other special forces teams with rhodesian forces even conducting their own independent operations during the conflict
due to portuguese policy of retaining up @-@ to @-@ date equipment for the metropole while shipping obsolete equipment to the colonies the portuguese soldiers fighting in the opening stages of the conflict were equipped with world war ii radios and the old mauser rifle
as the fighting progressed the need for more modern equipment was rapidly recognised and the heckler koch g3 and fn fal rifles were adopted as the standard battlefield weapon along with the ar @-@ <num> for paratroopers
the mg42 and then in <year> the hk21 were the portuguese general purpose machine guns with <num> <num> and <num> mm mortars howitzers and the aml @-@ <num> panhard ebr fox and chaimite armoured cars frequently deployed for fire support
although helicopters were not used in mozambique to the same extent as they were in vietnam the alouette iii was the most widely used although the puma was also used with great success
other aircraft were employed for air support the t6 and the fiat g
<num> were used for reconnaissance the dornier do <num>
in the transport role the portuguese air force used mainly the nord noratlas and the c @-@ <num>
the portuguese navy also made extensive use of patrol boats landing crafts and inflatable zodiacs
frelimo soldiers with logistical assistance from the local population attacked the administrative post at chai chai in the province of cabo delgado
frelimo militants were able to evade pursuit and surveillance by employing classic guerrilla tactics ambushing patrols sabotaging communication and railroad lines and making hit @-@ and @-@ run attacks against colonial outposts before rapidly fading into accessible backwater areas
the insurgents were typically armed with rifles and machine pistols and the attackers took full advantage of the monsoon season in order to evade pursuit
during heavy rains it was much more difficult to track insurgents by air negating portugal 's air superiority and portuguese troops and vehicles found movement during rain storms difficult
in contrast the insurgent troops with lighter equipment were able to flee into the bush the mato amongst an ethnically similar populace into which they could melt away
furthermore the frelimo forces were able to forage food from the surroundings and local villages and were thus not hampered by long supply lines
with the initial frelimo attacks in chai chai the fighting spread to niassa and tete at the centre of mozambique
during the early stages of the conflict frelimo activity was reduced to small platoon @-@ sized engagements harassments and raids on portuguese installations
the frelimo soldiers often operated in small groups of ten to fifteen soldiers
the scattered nature of frelimo 's initial attacks was an attempt to disperse the portuguese forces
the portuguese troops began to suffer losses in november fighting in the northern region of xilama
with increasing support from the populace and the low number of portuguese regular troops frelimo was quickly able to advance south towards meponda and mandimba linking to tete with the aid of forces from the neighbouring republic of malawi which had become a fully independent member of the commonwealth of nations on july <num> <year>
despite the increasing range of frelimo operations attacks were still limited to small strike teams attacking lightly defended administrative outposts with the frelimo lines of communication and supply utilising canoes along the ruvuma river and lake malawi
it was not until <year> that recruitment of fighters increased along with popular support and the strike teams were able to increase in size
the increase in popular support was in part due to frelimo agencies offer of help to exiled mozambicans who had fled the conflict by travelling to nearby tanzania
like similar conflicts against the french and united states forces in vietnam the insurgents also used landmines to a great extent to injure the portuguese forces thus straining the armed forces infrastructure and demoralising soldiers
frelimo attack groups had also begun to grow in size to include over <num> soldiers in certain cases and the insurgents also began to accept women fighters into their ranks
on either october <num> or october <num> <year> on returning to tanzania after inspecting the front lines filipe samuel magaia was shot dead by lourenço matola a fellow frelimo guerrilla who was said to be in the employ of the portuguese
one seventh of the population and one fifth of the territory were in frelimo hands by <year> at this time there were approximately <num> guerrillas in combat
during this period mondlane urged further expansion of the war effort but also sought to retain the small strike groups
with the increasing cost of supply more and more territory liberated from the portuguese and the adoption of measures to win the support of the population it was at this time that mondlane sought assistance from abroad specifically the soviet union and china from these benefactors he obtained large @-@ calibre machine guns anti @-@ aircraft rifles and <num> mm recoilless rifles and <num> mm rockets
in <year> the second congress of frelimo was a propaganda victory for the insurgents despite attempts by the portuguese who enjoyed air superiority throughout the conflict to bomb the location of the meeting late in the day
this gave frelimo further weight to wield in the united nations
in the <num> and early <num> to counter the increasing insurgency of frelimo forces and show to the portuguese people and the world that the territory was totally under control the portuguese government accelerated its major development program to expand and upgrade the infrastructure of portuguese mozambique by creating new roads railways bridges dams irrigation systems schools and hospitals to stimulate an even higher level of economic growth and support from the populace
as part of this redevelopment program construction of the cahora bassa dam began in <year>
this particular project became intrinsically linked with portugal 's concerns over security in the overseas colonies
the portuguese government viewed the construction of the dam as testimony to portugal 's civilising mission and intended for the dam to reaffirm mozambican belief in the strength and security of the portuguese colonial government
to this end portugal sent three thousand new troops and over one million landmines to mozambique to defend the building project
realising the symbolic significance of the dam to the portuguese frelimo proceeded to spend seven years attempting to halt its construction by force
no direct attacks were ever successful but frelimo had some success in attacking convoys en route to the site
frelimo also lodged a protest with the united nations about the project and their cause was aided by negative reports of portuguese actions in mozambique
in spite of the subsequent withdrawal of much foreign financial support for the dam it was finally completed in december <year>
the dam 's intended propaganda value to the portuguese was overshadowed by the adverse mozambican public reaction to the extensive dispersal of the indigenous populace who were forced to relocate from their homes to allow for the construction project
the dam also deprived farmers of the critical annual floods which formerly re @-@ fertilised the plantations
many sources state that in an attempt to rectify the situation in mozambique the portuguese secret police assassinated mondlane by sending a parcel to his office in dar es salaam
inside the parcel was a book containing an explosive device which detonated upon opening
other sources state that eduardo was killed when an explosive device detonated underneath his chair at the frelimo headquarters and that the faction responsible was never identified
the original investigations levelled accusations at silverio nungo who was later executed and lazaro kavandame frelimo leader in cabo delgado
the latter had made no secret of his distrust of mondlane seeing him as too conservative a leader and the tanzanian police also accused him of working with pide portugal 's secret police to assassinate mondlane
kavandame himself surrendered to the portuguese in april of that year
although the exact details of the assassination remain disputed the involvement of the portuguese government particularly aginter press or pide is generally accepted by most historians and biographers and is supported by the portuguese stay behind gladio @-@ esque army known as aginter press that suggested in <year> that they were responsible for the assassination
initially due to the uncertainty regarding who was responsible mondlane 's death created great suspicion within the ranks of the frelimo itself and a short power struggle which resulted in a dramatic swing to the political left
mondlane 's immediate successor was the moderate rev
uria simango who had served under him as frelimo 's vice @-@ president from its formation until <year>
in the post @-@ assassination power @-@ struggle simango was ousted by the more hardline samora machel and marcelino dos santos expelled from frelimo and eventually arrested and executed post @-@ independence in <year>
kaúlza de arriaga favoured a more direct method of fighting the insurgents and the established policy of using african counter @-@ insurgency forces was rejected in favour of the deployment of regular portuguese forces accompanied by a small number of african fighters
indigenous personnel were still recruited for special operations such as the special groups of parachutists in <year> though their role less significant under the new commander
his tactics were partially influenced by a meeting with united states general william westmoreland
by <year> there was growing pressure from other commanders particularly kaúlza de arriaga 's second in command general francisco da costa gomes for the use of african soldiers in flechas units
flechas units arrows were also employed in angola and were units under the command of the portuguese pide
composed of local tribesmen the units specialised in tracking reconnaissance and anti @-@ terrorist operations
costa gomes argued that african soldiers were cheaper and were better able to create a relationship with the local populace a tactic similar to the hearts and minds strategy being used by united states forces in vietnam at the time
these flechas units saw action in the territory at the very end stages of the conflict following the dismissal of kaúlza de arriaga on the eve of the portuguese coup in <year> – the carnation revolution
the units were to continue to cause problems for the frelimo even after the revolution and portuguese withdrawal when the country splintered into civil war
there were several portuguese special forces units that were unique to either the mozambican conflict or the portuguese colonial war as a whole special groups grupos especiais units similar to the ones used in angola paratrooper special groups grupos especiais pára @-@ quedistas units of volunteer black soldiers that had paratrooper training combat tracking special groups grupos especiais de pisteiros de combate special units trained in tracking flechas local tribesmen and rebel defectors specialised in tracking reconnaissance and terrorist operations
they sometimes patrolled in captured uniforms and are rewarded with cash bounties for every guerrilla or guerrilla weapon they capture
during the entire period of <year> – <num> frelimo intensified guerrilla operations specialising in urban terrorism
the use of landmines also intensified with sources stating that they had become responsible for two out of every three portuguese casualties
during the conflict frelimo used a variety of anti @-@ tank and anti @-@ personnel mines including the pmn black widow tm @-@ <num> and pomz
even amphibious mines were used such as the pdm
mine psychosis an acute fear of landmines was rampant in the portuguese forces
this fear coupled with the frustration of taking casualties without ever seeing the enemy forces damaged morale and significantly hampered progress
the gordian knot operation portuguese operação nó górdio targeted permanent insurgent camps and the infiltration routes across the tanzanian border in the north of mozambique over a period of seven months
the operation involved some <num> @,@ <num> portuguese troops particularly elite units like paratroopers commandos marines and naval fusiliers
the portuguese had excellent coordination between light bombers helicopters and reinforced ground patrols
they utilised american tactics of quick airborne helibourne assaults supported by heavy aerial bombardments of frelimo camps by the portuguese air force força aérea portuguesa or fap to surround and eliminate the guerrillas
these bombardments were accompanied by the use of heavy artillery
the portuguese also used cavalry units to cover the flanks of patrols and where the terrain was too difficult to motor transport and units of captured or deserted guerrillas to penetrate their former bases
problems for the portuguese arose almost immediately when the offensive coincided with the beginning of the monsoon season creating additional logistical difficulties
not only were the portuguese soldiers badly equipped but there was very poor cooperation if any at all between the fap and the army
thus the army lacked close air support from the fap
mounting portuguese casualties began to outweigh frelimo casualties leading to further political intervention from lisbon
the portuguese eventually reported <num> as killed a figure of some <num> was most likely closer to reality and <num> @,@ <num> captured for the loss of <num> portuguese
gen
arriaga also claimed his troops to have destroyed <num> guerrilla bases and <num> camps while <num> tons of ammunition had been captured in the first two months
although gordian knot was the most effective portuguese offensive of the conflict weakening guerrillas to such a degree that they were no longer a significant threat the operation was deemed a failure by some military officers and the government
by <year> the portuguese military had changed its strategy adapting the british american search and destroy operations utilising small shock troop sweeps
they also initiated a hearts and minds campaign named the aldeamentos programme which was a forced relocation program
but on november <num> <year> frelimo – not numbering more than <num> @,@ <num> fighters – launched a large offensive in tete province
the response from the portuguese military was fierce leading to reprisal attacks in an attempt to unbalance the local population 's continuing faith in frelimo
on december <num> <year> the portuguese <num> company of commandos in mozambique killed the inhabitants of the village of wiriyamu in the district of tete
referred to as the wiriyamu massacre the soldiers killed between <num> according to the red cross and <num> according to a much later investigation by the portuguese newspaper expresso based in testimonies from soldiers villagers accused of sheltering frelimo guerrillas
the action operation marosca was planned at the instigation of pide dgs agents and guided by agent chico kachavi who was later assassinated while an inquiry into the events was being carried out
the soldiers were told by this agent that the orders were to kill them all never mind that only civilians women and children included were found
all of the victims were civilians
the massacre was recounted in july <year> by the british catholic priest father adrian hastings and two other spanish missionary priests
later counter @-@ claims have been made in a report of archbishop of dar es salaam laurean rugambwa that alleged that the killings were carried out by frelimo combatants not portuguese forces
in addition others claimed that the alleged massacres by portuguese military forces were fabricated to tar the reputation of the portuguese state abroad
portuguese journalist felícia cabrita reconstructed the wiriyamu massacre in detail by interviewing both survivors and former members of the portuguese army commandos unit that carried out the massacre
cabrita 's report was published in the portuguese weekly newspaper expresso and later in a book containing several of the journalist 's articles
by <year> frelimo were also mining civilian towns and villages in an attempt to undermine the civilian confidence in the portuguese forces
aldeamentos agua para todos resettlement villages water for everyone was a commonly seen message in the rural areas as the portuguese sought to relocate and resettle the indigenous population in order to isolate the frelimo from its civilian base
conversely mondlane 's policy of mercy towards civilian portuguese settlers was abandoned in <year> by the new commander machel
panic demoralisation abandonment and a sense of futility – all were reactions among whites in mozambique stated conflict historian t
h
henricksen in <year>
this change in tactic led to protests by portuguese settlers against the lisbon government a telltale sign of the conflict 's unpopularity
combined with the news of the wiriyamu massacre and that of renewed frelimo onslaughts through <year> and early <year> the worsening situation in mozambique later contributed to the downfall of the portuguese government in <year>
they had carried out multiple sabotages and bombings against military targets such as the attack on the tancos air base that destroyed several helicopters on march <num> <year> and the attack on the nato headquarters at oeiras in october of the same year
the attack on the portuguese ship niassa illustrated the role of the colonial wars in this unrest
niassa named after a mozambican province was preparing to leave lisbon with troops to be deployed in guinea
by the time of the carnation revolution <num> @,@ <num> draft dodgers had been recorded
fighting colonial wars in portuguese colonies had absorbed forty @-@ four percent of the overall portuguese budget
this led to an obvious diversion of funds from necessary infrastructural developments in portugal itself
this contributed to the growing unrest in the european nation
portugal 's gdp growth during the colonial war period <year> – <year> was strong and reached a <num> rate a percentual gdp growth which were not achieved in any other comparable period after <year>
the unpopularity of the colonial wars among many portuguese led to the formation of several magazines and newspapers such as cadernos circunstância cadernos necessários tempo e modo and polémica which had support from students and called for political solutions to portugal 's colonial problems
the growing unrest in portugal culminated on april <num> <year> when the carnation revolution a peaceful leftist military coup d 'état in lisbon ousted the incumbent portuguese government of marcelo caetano
thousands of portuguese citizens left mozambique and the new head of government general antónio de spínola called for a ceasefire
with the change of government in lisbon many soldiers refused to continue fighting often remaining in their barracks instead of going on patrol
negotiations between the portuguese administration culminated in the lusaka accord signed on september <num> <year> which provided for a complete hand @-@ over of power to frelimo uncontested by elections
formal independence was set for june <num> <year> the <num> anniversary of the founding of frelimo
while most european communities in africa at the time with the possible exception of afrikaners were established from the late nineteenth to early twentieth centuries some white families and institutions in those territories still administered by portugal had been entrenched for generations
loss of their privileged status and fears of frelimo reprisal resulted in an exodus of up to <num> @,@ <num> white civilians at independence in europe they were popularly known as retornados
cities towns and villages saw their portuguese names changed after independence lourenço marques to maputo vila pery to chimoio vila cabral to lichinga or vila junqueiro to gurúè
with the departure of portuguese professionals and tradesmen the new country had no senior workforce to maintain its infrastructure and economic collapse loomed
privileged commercial links were established with several communist countries by the frelimo regime at the expense of nato which rapidly lost influence in the region
samora machel became mozambique 's first president
the reverend uria simango his wife and other frelimo dissidents were arrested in <year> and detained without trial
within about two years fighting resumed with the mozambican civil war against renamo insurgents plied with rhodesian and south african military support
industrial and social recession marxist @-@ style totalitarianism corruption poverty inequality and failed central planning eroded the initial revolutionary fervour
peace returned only in <year> when the nation achieved relative stability for the first time in several decades
it takes place in a fantastic version of the caribbean during the age of piracy
the player assumes the role of guybrush threepwood a young man who dreams of becoming a pirate and explores fictional islands while solving puzzles
the game was conceived in <year> by lucasfilm employee ron gilbert who designed it with tim schafer and dave grossman
gilbert 's frustrations with contemporary adventure titles led him to make the player character 's death almost impossible which meant that gameplay focused the game on exploration
the atmosphere was based on that of the pirates of the caribbean theme park ride
the secret of monkey island was the fifth game built with the scumm engine which was heavily modified to include a more user @-@ friendly interface
critics praised the secret of monkey island for its humor audiovisuals and gameplay
the game spawned a number of sequels collectively known as the monkey island series
gilbert schafer and grossman also led the development of the sequel monkey island <num> lechuck 's revenge
lucasarts released a remake of the original in <year> which was also well received by the gaming press
via a point @-@ and @-@ click interface the player guides protagonist guybrush threepwood through the game 's world and interacts with the environment by selecting from twelve verb commands nine in newer versions such as talk to for communicating with characters and pick up for collecting items between commands and the world 's objects in order to successfully solve puzzles and thus progress in the game
while conversing with other characters the player may choose between topics for discussion that are listed in a dialog tree the game is one of the first to incorporate such a system
the in @-@ game action is frequently interrupted by cutscenes
like other lucasarts adventure games the secret of monkey island features a design philosophy that makes the player character 's death nearly impossible guybrush does drown if he stays underwater for more than ten minutes
he seeks out the island 's pirate leaders who set him three trials that must be completed to become a pirate winning a sword duel against carla the island 's resident swordmaster finding a buried treasure and stealing a valuable idol from the governor 's mansion
these quests take guybrush throughout the island where he hears of stories of the ghost pirate lechuck who apparently died in an expedition to the mysterious monkey islandtm an act that was meant to win the love of the governor elaine marley
guybrush meets several characters of interest including a local voodoo priestess stan the used boat salesman carla the sword master a prisoner named otis and meathook whose hands have been replaced by hooks
guybrush also encounters the governor and is instantly smitten and she soon reciprocates
however as he completes the tasks set for him the island is raided by lechuck and his undead crew who abduct elaine and then retreat to their secret hideout on monkey islandtm
guybrush takes it upon himself to rescue her buying a ship and hiring carla otis and meathook as crew before setting sail for the fabled island
when guybrush reaches monkey island he discovers a village of cannibals in a dispute with herman toothrot a ragged castaway marooned there
he settles their quarrel and then recovers a magical voodoo root from lechuck 's ship for the cannibals who provide him with a seltzer bottle of voodoo root elixir that can destroy ghosts
when guybrush returns to lechuck 's ship with the elixir he learns that lechuck has returned to mêlée islandtm to marry elaine at the church
he promptly returns to mêlée islandtm and gatecrashes the wedding only to ruin elaine 's own plan for escape in the process he loses the elixir
now confronted with a furious lechuck guybrush is savagely beaten by the ghost pirate in a fight ranging across the island
the fight eventually arrives at the island 's ship emporium where guybrush finds a bottle of root beer
substituting the beverage for the lost elixir he sprays lechuck destroying the ghost pirate
with lechuck defeated guybrush and elaine enjoy a romantic moment watching fireworks caused by lechuck exploding
he first wrote story ideas about pirates while spending the weekend at a friend 's house
gilbert experimented with introductory paragraphs to find a satisfactory idea
his initial story featured unnamed villains that would eventually become lechuck and elaine guybrush was absent at this point
he pitched it to lucasfilm games 's staff as a series of short stories
gilbert 's idea was warmly received but production was postponed because lucasfilm games assigned its designers including gilbert to indiana jones and the last crusade the graphic adventure
development of the last crusade was finished in <year> which allowed gilbert to begin production of the secret of monkey island then known internally under the working title mutiny on monkey island
gilbert soon realised that it would be difficult to design the game by himself he decided to join forces with tim schafer and dave grossman both of whom he hired for lucasfilm
the game 's insult sword fighting mechanics were influenced by swashbuckling movies starring errol flynn which gilbert schafer and grossman often watched for inspiration
they noticed that pirates in those films often taunted their opponents instead of attacking them which gave the designers the idea to base the game 's duels on insults rather than combat
writer orson scott card helped them write the insults during a visit to lucasfilm 's headquarters at skywalker ranch
many of gilbert 's original gameplay ideas were abandoned during the production process although he stated that most of that stuff was left out for a reason
the game 's plot as described by dave grossman “ it ’ s a story about this young man who comes to an island in search of his life ’ s dream
he ’ s pursuing his career goals and he discovers love in the process and winds up thinking that was actually more important than what he was doing to begin with
you ’ re laughing but there ’ s actually something deeper going on as well
” when work on the plot began gilbert discovered that schafer 's and grossman 's writing styles were too different to form a cohesive whole grossman 's was very kind of a dry sarcastic humor and schafer 's was just a little more in your face
in reaction gilbert assigned them to different characters and story moments depending on what type of comedy was required
grossman believed that this benefited the game 's writing as he and schafer were all funny in slightly different ways and it worked well together
schafer and grossman wrote most of the dialogue while they were programming the game as a result much of it was improvised
some of the dialogue was based on the designers personal experiences such as guybrush 's line i had a feeling in hell there would be mushrooms which came from schafer 's own hatred of fungi
the game 's world and characters were designed primarily by gilbert
after having read tim powers historical fantasy novel on stranger tides he decided to add paranormal themes to the game 's plot
he also cited powers book as an influence on the characters particularly those of guybrush and lechuck
inspiration for the game 's ambiance came from gilbert 's favorite childhood amusement park ride pirates of the caribbean
grossman said that gilbert always wanted to step off the ride and talk to the people who lived in that world
near the final stages of the design work gilbert introduced several characters who were not directly related to the game 's story
he considered this to be an important decision as the player would need those seemingly minor characters in later parts of the game and would receive a chance to really interact with them
gilbert had conceived the main designs and puzzles before production began which resulted in the bulk of the designers work to flesh out his ideas
he was frustrated by the adventure games that sierra on @-@ line was releasing at the time and later said that you died any time you did anything wrong
gilbert considered such gameplay as a cheap way out for the designer
he had previously applied his design ideas to the <year> graphic adventure title maniac mansion but committed a number of mistakes during development such as dead @-@ end situations that prevented the player from completing the game and poorly implemented triggers for cutscenes
gilbert aimed to avoid such errors in the secret of monkey island
the team decided to make it impossible for the player character to die which focused gameplay primarily on world exploration
the sierra game @-@ over screen was parodied when guybrush falls off a cliff only to be bounced back up by a rubber tree
the secret of monkey island was the fifth lucasfilm games project powered by the scumm engine originally developed for maniac mansion
the company had gradually modified the engine since its creation
for maniac mansion the developers hard coded verb commands in the scumm scripting language
these commands become more abstract in subsequent versions of the engine
the developers carried over the practice of referring to individual segments of the gameworld as rooms even though the areas in monkey island were outdoors
the game uses the same version of the engine used in indiana jones and the last crusade with minor changes
a dialog tree was added which facilitated conversation options and the sword @-@ fighting puzzles
the developers removed the what is option an input command that describes an on @-@ screen object to the player in favor of allowing the player to simply highlight the object with the mouse cursor
the game 's improved interface became the standard for the company 's later titles
the game also introduced logical verb shortcuts which could be performed with the mouse for example clicking on a character defaults to the talk action the most obvious action in the situation
scumm 's visuals were updated for the game — the original ega version had a 320x200 pixel resolution rendered in <num> colors
according to artist steve purcell that became a major limitation for the art team due to a low number of ghastly colors they often chose bizarre tones for backgrounds
they chose black and white for guybrush 's outfit for the same reason
the vga version of the game later corrected these issues by implementing <num> color support which allowed for more advanced background and character art
the vga and other platform releases removed the infamous stump joke from the game which was a joke in the ega version in which the player would examine a tree stump in the forest
guybrush would exclaim that there is an opening to a system of catacombs and attempt to enter but this would result in a message stating the player needed to insert disc <num> then <num> then <num> in order to continue
the joke resulted in numerous calls to the lucasarts hotline asking about missing discs
as a result the joke was removed from later editions and is a mentioned as a conversation option for the lucasarts hint hotline in the sequel
the game 's pirate reggae music was composed by lucasfilm games in @-@ house musician michael land in midi format
it was his first project at the company
the game was originally released for floppy disk in <year> but a cd @-@ rom version with a high @-@ quality cd soundtrack followed in <year>
the music has remained popular and has been remixed by the musicians of overclocked remix and by the game 's fans
playstation <num> mac os and ipad versions followed early in <year> for download on their respective services
lucasarts confirmed the game 's development on june <num> <year> rumors appeared several days earlier when the xbox <num> version of the game received an usk rating
the game was first displayed to the public at the <year> e3 in june
the remake features hand @-@ drawn visuals with more detail a remastered musical score voice work for characters and a hint system
the developers included the function to switch between <year> and original audiovisuals at will
the voice actors included dominic armato as guybrush threepwood and earl boen as lechuck most had provided voice work in sequels to the secret of monkey island
lucasarts 's game producer craig derrick and his team conceived the idea of the remake in <year>
after researching the monkey island series history they decided to make something fresh and new while staying true to the original which resulted in the idea of the secret of monkey island 's remake
the developers tried to leave much of the original design unchanged
any changes were intended to achieve the level of immersion desired for the original
to that end they added details like a pirate ship or pirates talking in the background of scenes
while the team considered the scumm interface revolutionary at the time lucasarts community manager brooks brown noted that it is incompatible with an analog stick which most consoles use
the designers made the cursor contextual to the game objects as the primary interface
brown had considered updating the reference to advertise star wars the force unleashed because loom was not on the market at the time but concluded that the game would not be the same if such changes were implemented
prior to the special edition release however lucasarts announced that loom along with other games from its back catalog would be made available on steam
brown stated that the decision to distribute the game online was because digital downloads have finally gotten going
hartley patricia and kirk lesser of dragon praised the designers attention to detail and cited the game 's humor as a high point
although they believed that the game was too expensive they summarized it as a highly enjoyable graphic adventure replete with interesting puzzles a fantastic roland soundtrack superb vga graphics smooth @-@ scrolling animation and some of the funniest lines ever seen on your computer screen
duncan macdonald of zero praised the graphics and found the game quite amusing
his favorite aspect was the fine @-@ tuned difficulty level which he believed was just right
he ended his review at last an adventure game that 's enjoyable rather than frustrating
paul glancey of computer and video games consider the game superior to lucasfilm 's earlier adventure titles and wrote that usually the entertainment you get from an adventure is derived solely from solving puzzles but the hilarious characters and situations and the movie @-@ like presentation
make playing this more like taking part in a comedy film so it 's much more enjoyable
he considered the puzzles to be brilliantly conceived and found the game 's controls accessible
he summarized it as utterly enthralling
ace 's steve cooke also found the controls convenient and he praised the game 's atmosphere
he wrote that in graphics and sound terms
monkey island along with king 's quest v is currently at the head of the pack
however he disliked the designers running joke of placing tm after character and place names which he thought detracted from the atmosphere
he singled out the game 's writing characters and plot structure as its best elements
amiga power 's mark ramshaw wrote with the secret of monkey island the mouse @-@ controlled graphic @-@ adventure comes of age
he lauded its comedic elements which he believed were the highlight of the game
the reviewer also praised the control scheme noting that it allows the player to more or less forget about the specifics of what they are physically doing
and lose themselves in the adventure instead
he noted that the game 's plot and visual and aural presentation fit together to create a thick atmosphere and finished forget all those other milestone adventures zork the hobbit lord of the rings et al — for sheer enjoyment and general all @-@ round perfection the secret of monkey island creams em all in style
the game along with its sequel was ranked the <num> best game of all time by amiga power
writing for the one paul presley stated that lucasfilm appears to have taken all of the elements that worked in its previous releases and not only incorporated them into this tale of scurvy swashbuckling but even improved on them in the process like the other reviewers he praised its controls
he also lauded its hilarious storyline strong characters and
intriguing setting but complained about graphical slowdowns
nick clarkson of amiga computing cited the game 's graphics as flawless noting that the characters are superbly animated and the backdrops simply ooze atmosphere
he highly praised its sound effects and music and believed that its controls couldn 't be simpler
the staff of amiga action wrote that the attention to detail and the finely tuned gameplay cannot be faulted
they called the graphics stunning throughout and believed that when they were combined with the excellent caribbean tunes the result is a game filled with character and atmosphere
they ended by stating that there is absolutely no excuse for not owning this game
the secret of monkey island has featured regularly in lists of top games such as computer gaming world 's hall of fame and ign 's video game hall of fame
in <year> computer gaming world ranked it as the <num> best game of all time writing who could ever forget the insult @-@ driven duel system or the identity of the mysterious swordmaster
in <year> readers of retro gamer voted it as the <num> top retro game

in <year> ign named the secret of monkey island one of the ten best lucasarts adventure games
sean ely of gamepro praised its updated audio and said that the new graphics blow the old clunker visuals
out of the water
he cited its script humor plot puzzles and balanced difficulty level as high points and finished the secret of monkey island special edition is impressive hilarious and downright worth your money
daemon hatfield of ign wrote almost <num> years after its release the secret of monkey island remains a blast to play
he called the new graphics slick if a little generic and noted that the original graphics have a certain charm to them that the fancy pants new visuals just don 't
however he enjoyed the redone music the new hint function and the added sound effects and voice acting
he summarized it as one of the best times you 'll ever have pointing and clicking and noted that few games are this funny
justin calvert of gamespot noted that the special edition looks much better and is the only way to play if you want to hear
what characters are saying whereas the original game 's interface is less clunky
however he wrote that the voice work is such a great addition to the game that it 's difficult to go back to the original edition
he praised its humor writing puzzles and characters and he believed that it had aged well
eurogamer 's dan whitehead wrote purists like me will almost certainly find something to grumble about over the span of the game but the overall impact of the redesign is undeniably for the better
however he preferred the original game 's guybrush design and believed that the new control system was rather less intuitive than the old one
he finished by stating that few games can stand the test of time with such confidence
the first monkey island <num> lechuck 's revenge was released in <year> and focuses on lechuck 's return
six years later lucasarts released the curse of monkey island which features a new visual design
in <year> the company released escape from monkey island which uses the grime engine of grim fandango to produce 3d graphics
the next title tales of monkey island released in <year> is a series of five episodic chapters
elements of the game have appeared elsewhere in popular culture
the original version was selected as one of five for the exhibition the art of video games in the smithsonian american art museum in <year>
a fictive drink recipe in the game for grog was mistakenly reported as real in <year> by argentinian news channel c5n which urged adolescents against consuming the dangerous grog xd drink
in tales of monkey island guybrush refers to this news story while pushing the grog xd button on a grog machine
it is located near the awali river <num> kilometres <num>
<num> mi northeast of sidon in southwestern lebanon
the site was occupied from the <num> century bc to the <num> century ad suggesting an integrated relationship with the nearby city of sidon
although originally constructed by sidonian king eshmunazar ii in the achaemenid era c
<num> – <num> bc to celebrate the city 's recovered wealth and stature the temple complex was greatly expanded by bodashtart yatan @-@ milk and later monarchs
because the continued expansion spanned many centuries of alternating independence and foreign hegemony the sanctuary features a wealth of different architectural and decorative styles and influences
the sanctuary consists of an esplanade and a grand court limited by a huge limestone terrace wall that supports a monumental podium which was once topped by eshmun 's graeco @-@ persian style marble temple
the sanctuary features a series of ritual ablution basins fed by canals channeling water from the asclepius river modern awali and from the sacred ydll spring these installations were used for therapeutic and purificatory purposes that characterize the cult of eshmun
the sanctuary site has yielded many artifacts of value especially those inscribed with phoenician texts providing valuable insight into the site 's history and that of ancient sidon
the eshmun temple was improved during the early roman empire with a colonnade street but declined after earthquakes and fell into oblivion as christianity replaced paganism and its large limestone blocks were used to build later structures
the temple site was rediscovered in <year> by local treasure hunters who stirred the curiosity of international scholars
maurice dunand a french archaeologist thoroughly excavated the site from <year> until the beginning of the lebanese civil war in <year>
after the end of the hostilities and the retreat of israel from southern lebanon the site was rehabilitated and inscribed to the world heritage site tentative list
originally a nature divinity and a god of spring vegetation eshmun was equated to babylonian deity tammuz
his role later expanded within the phoenician pantheon and he gained celestial and cosmic attributes
the myth of eshmun was related by the sixth century syrian neoplatonist philosopher damascius and ninth century patriarch of constantinople photius
they recount that eshmun a young man from beirut was hunting in the woods when astarte saw him and was stricken by his beauty
she harassed him with her amorous pursuit until he emasculated himself with an axe and died
the grieving goddess revived eshmun and transported him to the heavens where she made him into a god of heaven
from a historical perspective the first written mention of eshmun goes back to <num> bc the date of the signing of the treaty between assyrian king ashur @-@ nirari v and mati 'el king of arpad eshmun figures in the text as a patron of the treaty
eshmun was identified with asclepius as a result of the hellenic influence over phoenicia the earliest evidence of this equation is given by coins from amrit and acre from the third century bc
this fact is exemplified by the hellenized names of the awali river which was dubbed asclepius fluvius and the eshmun temple 's surrounding groves known as the groves of asclepius
the new sovereigns exacted tribute from sidon along with every other phoenician city
these payments stimulated sidon 's search for new means of provisioning and furthered phoenician emigration and expansion which peaked in the <num> century bc
when assyrian king sargon ii died in <num> bc the sidonian king luli joined with the egyptians and judah in an unsuccessful rebellion against assyrian rule but was forced to flee to kition modern larnaca in cyprus with the arrival of the assyrian army headed by sennacherib sargon ii 's son and successor
sennacherib instated ittobaal on the throne of sidon and reimposed the annual tribute
when abdi @-@ milkutti ascended to sidon 's throne in <num> bc he also rebelled against the assyrians
in response the assyrian king esarhaddon laid siege to the city
abdi @-@ milkutti was captured and beheaded in <num> bc after a three @-@ year siege while his city was destroyed and renamed kar @-@ ashur @-@ aha @-@ iddina the harbor of esarhaddon
sidon was stripped of its territory which was awarded to baal i the king of rival tyre and loyal vassal to esarhaddon
baal i and esarhaddon signed a treaty in <num> in which eshmun 's name features as one of the deities invoked as guarantors of the covenant
nevertheless the sidonian king was still held in exile at the court of babylon
sidon reclaimed its former standing as phoenicia 's chief city in the achaemenid empire c
<num> – <num> bc
during this period xerxes i awarded king eshmunazar ii with the sharon plain for employing sidon 's fleet in his service during the greco @-@ persian wars
eshmunazar ii displayed his new @-@ found wealth by constructing numerous temples to sidonian divinities
inscriptions found on the king 's sarcophagus reveal that he and his mother amashtarte built temples to the gods of sidon including the temple of eshmun by the ydll source near the cistern
as two series of inscriptions on the foundations of the monumental podium attest construction of the sanctuary 's podium did not begin until the reign of king bodashtart
the first set of inscriptions bears the name of bodashtart alone while the second contains his name and that of the crown prince yatan @-@ milk
a phoenician inscription located <num> kilometres <num>
<num> mi upstream from the temple that dates to the <num> year of bodashtart 's reign alludes to water adduction works from the awali river to the ydll source that was used for ritual purification at the temple
the temple site remained a place of pilgrimage in the classical antiquity during the early roman empire and until the advent of christianity when the cult of eshmun was banned and a christian church was built at the temple site across the roman street from the podium
remnants and mosaic floors of a byzantine church can still be seen on the site
a roman colonnade was built in the third century probably by emperor septimius severus and a roman villa showed a period of renewed relative importance for the city during the late period of phoenicia under roman rule
furthermore within the original phoenician temple site the romans added the processional stairway the basins for ablutions and a nymphaeum with pictorial mosaics that are still largely intact
worn statuettes of three nymphs stand in the niches of a roman fountain
another earthquake hit sidon around <num> ad antoninus of piacenza an italian christian pilgrim described the city as partly in ruins
for many years after the disappearance of the cult of eshmun the sanctuary site was used as a quarry emir fakhr @-@ al @-@ din ii for example used its massive blocks to build a bridge over the awali river in the <num> century
<num> @-@ metre <num> ft stone blocks near the awali river
when the french orientalist ernest renan visited the area in <year> he noticed that the awali bridge abutments were built of finely rusticated blocks that originated from an earlier structure
he also noted in his report mission de phénicie that a local treasure hunter told him of a large edifice near the awali bridge
in <year> local clandestine treasure hunters digging at the eshmun temple site haphazardly discovered inscriptions carved onto the temple 's walls
this discovery stirred the interest of theodore macridy curator of the museum of constantinople who cleared the temple remains between <year> and <year>
wilhelm von landau also excavated the site between <year> and <year>
in <year> gaston contenau headed a team of archaeologists who surveyed the temple complex
the first extensive archaeological excavation revealing the eshmun temple remains was undertaken by maurice dunand between <year> and <year>
archaeological evidence shows that the site was occupied from the seventh century bc to the eighth century ad
today the eshmun sanctuary can be visited all year round and free of charge it is accessible from an exit ramp off the main southern lebanon highway near sidon 's northern entrance
the site holds a particular archaeological importance since it is the best preserved phoenician site in lebanon it was added to the unesco world heritage tentative list 's cultural category on july <num> <year>
in literature the temple of eshmun figures in nabil saleh 's <year> novel the curse of ezekiel as the setting where bomilcar falls in love and rescues princess chiboulet from the evil design of one of the temple 's priests
the phoenician inscriptions on the sarcophagus of eshmunazar ii a sidonian king commemorate the construction of a house for the holy prince eshmun by the king and his mother queen amashtart at the ydll source by the cistern
dionysius periegetes an ancient greek travel writer identified the eshmun temple by the bostrenos river and antonin de plaisance a <num> @-@ century ad italian pilgrim recorded the shrine as near the river asclepius fluvius
strabo and other sidonian sources describe the sanctuary and its surrounding sacred forests of asclepius the hellenized name of eshmun in written texts
located about <num> kilometres <num> mi south of beirut and <num> kilometres <num>
<num> mi northeast of sidon the eshmun temple sits on the southern bank of the modern awali river previously referred to as bostrenos or asclepius fluvius in ancient text
citrus groves known as bustan el @-@ sheikh arabic بستان الشيخ the grove of the sheikh occupy the ancient sacred forests of asclepius and are a favorite summer picnic location for locals
fragments of marble column bases with torus moldings and facetted columns found east of the podium are also attributed to the babylonian era
the pyramidal structure was superimposed during persian rule by a massive ashlar podium constructed from heavily bossed limestone blocks that measured more than <num> metres <num>
<num> ft across by <num> metre <num>
<num> ft thick which were laid down in courses <num> @-@ metre <num>
<num> ft high
the podium stands <num> metres <num> ft high runs50 metres <num> ft into the hillside and boasts a <num> @-@ metre <num> ft wide façade
the terrace atop of the podium was once covered by a greco @-@ persian style marble temple probably built by ionic artisans around <num> bc
the marble temple has been reduced to a few remaining stone fragments due to theft
during the hellenistic period the sanctuary was extended from the base of the podium across the valley
to the east base of the podium stands a large chapel <num>
<num> by <num>
<num> metres <num> ft × <num> ft dating to the <num> century bc
the chapel was adorned with a paved pool and a large stone throne carved of a single block of granite in the egyptian style it is flanked by two sphinx figures and surrounded by two lion sculptures
the throne attributed to the sidonian goddess astarte rests against the chapel wall which is embellished by relief sculptures of hunting scenes
the once important astarte basin lost its function during the <num> century ad and was filled with earth and statue fragments
the west base contains another <num> century bc chapel — centered on a bull protome topped capital — that remains preserved at the national museum of beirut
widely known as the tribune of eshmun because of its shape the altar of eshmun is a white marble structure dating to the <num> century bc
it is <num>

unearthed in <year> by maurice dunand it stands on a limestone socleplated with marble blocks that rest against a retaining wall
the altar is adorned with hellenistic style relief sculptures and is framed by decorative moldings one of which divides the altar into two distinct registers of symmetrical composition
the upper register portrays <num> greek deities including two charioteers surrounding the greek god apollo who is depicted playing a cithara a type of lyre
the lower register honors dionysus who leads his thiasos his ecstatic revenue in a dance to the music of pipe and cithara players
the tribune is displayed at the national museum of beirut
northeast of the site another <num> century bc temple stands adjacent to the astarte chapel
its <num> @-@ metre <num> ft façade is built with large limestone blocks and displays a two @-@ register relief decoration illustrating a drunken revelry in honor of dionysus the greek god of wine
among the temple reliefs one shows a man attempting to seize a large rooster which was the common sacrificial animal for eshmun @-@ asclepius
the eshmun temple complex comprises an elaborate hydraulic installation channeling water from ydll spring that is made up of an intricate system of water canals a series of retaining basins sacred ablution basins and paved pools
this system demonstrates the importance of ritual ablutions in phoenician therapeutic cults
later vestiges date from the roman epoch and include a colonnaded road lined with shops
of the large marble columns bordering the roman street only fragments and bases remain
the romans also built a monumental staircase adorned with mosaic patterns that leads to the top of the podium
to the right of the roman road near the entrance of the site stands a nymphaeum with niches where statues of the nymphs once stood
the floor of the nymphaeum is covered by a mosaic depicting the maenads
across the colonnaded road facing the nymphaeum are the ruins of a roman villa only the villa 's courtyard has survived along with the remains of a mosaic depicting the four seasons
to the right of the processional roman staircase stands a cubic altar also of roman construction
other roman period structures include two columns of a great portico leading to pools and other cultic installations
aside from the extramural sanctuary at bustan el @-@ sheikh eshmun also had a temple within the city
the extramural eshmun temple was associated with purification and healing ritual lustral ablutions were performed in the sanctuary 's sacred basins supplemented by running water from the asclepius river and the ydll spring water which was considered to have a sacred character and therapeutic quality
the healing attributions of eshmun were combined with his divine consort astarte 's fertilizing powers the latter had an annex chapel with a sacred paved pool within the eshmun sanctuary
pilgrims from all over the ancient world flocked to the eshmun temple leaving votive traces of their devotion and proof of their cure
there is evidence that from the <num> century bc onwards there have been attempts to hellenize the cult of eshmun and to associate him with his greek counterpart asclepius but the sanctuary retained its curative function
some of these smaller finds include a collection of inscribed ostraca unearthed by dunand providing rare examples of cursive phoenician writing in the phoenician mainland
one of the recovered ostracon bears the theophoric phoenician name grtnt which suggests that veneration of the lunar @-@ goddess tanit occurred in sidon
a number of fragmented votive life @-@ size sculptures of little children lying on their side and holding a pet animal or a small object were also recovered at the temple site among the best known of these is a sculpture of a royal child holding a dove with his right hand the boy 's head is shaved his torso is bare and his lower body is wrapped in a large cloth
the socle of this sculpture is inscribed with a dedication from baalshillem the son of a sidonian king to eshmun which illustrates the importance of the site to the sidonian monarchy
these votive sculptures appear to have been purposely broken after dedication to eshmun and then ceremoniously cast into the sacred canal probably simulating the sacrifice of the sick child
all of these sculptures represent boys

<num> in limestone bust of a kouros dating from the <num> century bc was found at the site but unlike the archaic greek kouroi this figure is not bare
among the notable finds is a golden plaque showing a snake curling on a staff a hellenic symbol of eshmun
and a granite altar bearing the name of egyptian pharaoh achoris uncovered in the eshmun sanctuary
this gift attests to the good relations between the pharaoh and the kings of sidon
the repute of the sanctuary was far reaching
cypriot pilgrims from paphos left marks of their devotion for astarte on a marble stele inscribed both in greek and cypriot syllabary at astarte 's shrine this stele is now in the custody of the lebanese directorate general of antiquities
during the civil war upon a request from then lebanese director general of antiquities maurice chehab maurice dunand moved more than <year> artifacts from sidon to a subterranean chamber at the byblos crusader castle <num> kilometres <num> mi north of beirut
in <year> the depot was looted and around <num> sculptures and architectural elements were stolen and smuggled out of lebanon
rolf stucky ex @-@ director of the institute of classical archeology of basel affirmed during a conference in beirut in december <year> the successful identification and return of eight sculptures to the lebanese national museum
he published comic illustrated cautionary tales from <year> achieving his most notable works in the <num>
busch 's illustrations used wood engraving and later zincography
busch drew on contemporary parochial and city life satirizing catholicism philistinism strict religious morality and bigotry
his comic text was colourful and entertaining using onomatopoeia neologisms and other figures of speech and led to some work being banned by the authorities
busch was influential in both poetry and illustration and became a source for future generations of comic artists
the katzenjammer kids was inspired by busch 's max and moritz one of a number of imitations produced in germany and the united states
the wilhelm busch prize and the wilhelm busch museum help maintain his legacy
his <num> anniversary in <year> was celebrated throughout germany
busch remains one of the most influential poets and artists in western europe
there in <year> he bought a thatched half @-@ timbered house where wilhelm busch was to be born about <num> years later
amalie kleine johann 's wife and wilhelm busch 's grandmother kept a shop in which busch 's mother henriette assisted while her two brothers attended high school
when johann georg kleine died in <year> his widow continued to run the shop with henriette
at the age of <num> henriette kleine married surgeon friedrich wilhelm stümpe
henriette became widowed at the age of <num> with her three children to stümpe dying as infants
about <year> friedrich wilhelm busch the illegitimate son of a farmer settled in wiedensahl after completing a business apprenticeship in the nearby village of loccum
he took over the kleine shop in wiedensahl which he completely modernised
his six siblings followed shortly after fanny <year> gustav <year> adolf <year> otto <year> anna <year> and hermann <year> all survived childhood
his parents were ambitious hard @-@ working and devout protestants who later despite becoming relatively prosperous could not afford to educate all three sons
busch 's biographer berndt w
wessling suggested that friedrich wilhelm busch invested heavily in his sons education partly because his own illegitimacy held significant stigma in rural areas
the young wilhelm busch was a tall child but with a rather delicate and graceful physique
the coarse boyishness of his later protagonists max and moritz was rare in his childhood
he described himself in autobiographical sketches and letters as sensitive and timid as someone who carefully studied apprehension and who reacted with fascination compassion and distress when animals were killed in the autumn
he described the transformation to sausage as dreadfully compelling leaving a lasting impression pork nauseated him throughout his life
in the autumn of <year> after the birth of his brother otto busch 's education was entrusted to the <num> @-@ year @-@ old clergyman georg kleine his maternal uncle at ebergötzen this probably through lack of space in the busch family home and his father 's desire for a better education than the small local school could provide where <num> children were taught within a space of <num> <num> <num> sq ft
the nearest convenient school was located in bückeburg <num> km <num> mi from wiedensahl
kleine with his wife fanny petri lived in a rectory at ebergötzen while busch was lodged with an unrelated family
kleine and his wife were responsible and caring exercised a substitute parental role and provided refuge for him in future unsuccessful times
kleine 's private lessons for busch were also attended by erich bachmann the son of a wealthy ebergötzen miller
both became friends according to busch the strongest friendship of his childhood
this friendship was echoed in the <year> story max and moritz
a small pencil portrait by the <num> @-@ year @-@ old busch depicted bachmann as a chubby confident boy and showed similarities with max
busch portrayed himself with a cowlick in the later moritzian perky style
kleine was a philologist his lessons not held in contemporary language and it is not known for certain all subjects busch and his friend were taught
busch did learn elementary arithmetic from his uncle although science lessons might have been more comprehensive as kleine like many other clergymen was a beekeeper and published essays and textbooks on the subject — busch demonstrated his knowledge of bee @-@ keeping in his future stories
drawing and german and english poetry were also taught by kleine
busch had little contact with his natural parents during this period
at the time the <num> km <num> mi journey between wiedensahl and ebergötzen took three days by horse
his father visited ebergötzen two to three times a year while his mother stayed in wiedensahl to look after the children
the <num> @-@ year @-@ old busch visited his family once his mother at first did not recognize him
some busch biographers think that this early separation from his parents especially from his mother resulted in his eccentric bachelorhood
in the autumn of <year> busch moved with the kleine 's to lüthorst where on <num> april <year> he was confirmed
busch 's biographers are not in agreement as to why his hanover education ended most believe that his father had little appreciation of his son 's artistic inclination
biographer eva weissweiler suspects that kleine played a major role and that other possible causes were busch 's friendship with an innkeeper brümmer political debates in brümmer 's tavern and busch 's reluctance to believe every word of the bible and catechism
busch studied for nearly four years at hanover despite initial difficulties in understanding the subject matter
a few months before graduation he confronted his parents with his aspiration to study at the düsseldorf art academy
according to bush 's nephew hermann nöldeke his mother supported this inclination
his father eventually acquiesced and busch moved to düsseldorf in june <year> where to his disappointment at not being admitted to the advanced class he entered preparatory classes
busch 's parents had his tuition fees paid for one year so in may <year> he traveled to antwerp to continue study at the royal academy of fine arts under josephus laurentius dyckmans
he led his parents to believe that the academy was less regimented than düsseldorf and had the opportunity to study old masters
at antwerp he saw for the first time paintings by peter paul rubens adriaen brouwer david teniers and frans hals
the pictures aroused his interest but made him doubt his own skills
eventually in <year> after suffering heavily from typhus he abandoned his antwerp studies and returned penniless to wiedensahl
busch 's biographer joseph kraus saw these collections as useful additions to folklore as busch noted the narrative background to tales and the idiosyncrasies of storytellers
busch tried to release the collections but as a publisher could not be found at the time they were issued after his death
during the nazi era busch was known as an ethnic seer
after busch had spent six months with his uncle kleine at lüthorst he expressed an aim to continue study in munich
this request caused a rift with his father who however eventually funded this move see for comparison busch 's illustrated story of painter klecksel
busch 's expectations of the munich academy of fine arts were not met
his life became aimless there were occasional return visits to lüthorst but contact with his parents had been broken off
in <year> and <year> as his position seemed to be without prospects he contemplated emigration to brazil to keep bees
busch made contact with the artist association jung münchen young munich met several notable munich artists and wrote and provided cartoons for the jung münchen newspaper
kaspar braun who published the satirical newspapers münchener bilderbogen picture sheets from munich and fliegende blätter flying leaves proposed a collaboration with busch
this association provided busch with sufficient funds to live
an existing self @-@ caricature suggests that at this time he had an intense relationship with a woman from ammerland
his courtship with a seventeen @-@ year @-@ old merchant 's daughter anna richter whom busch met through his brother gustav ended in <year>
busch 's biographer diers suggests that her father probably refused to entrust his daughter to an almost unknown artist without regular income
in his early munich years busch 's attempt to write libretti which are almost forgotten today were unsuccessful
up to <year> he worked on two or three major works the third was composed by georg kremplsetzer
busch 's liebestreu und grausamkeit a romantic opera in three acts hansel und gretel and der vetter auf besuch an opera buffa of sorts were not particularly successful
there was a dispute between busch and kremplsetzer during the staging of der vetter auf besuch leading to the removal of busch 's name from the production the piece was renamed singspiel von georg kremplsetzer
in <year> busch returned several times to munich and took part in the intense life of the munich art society as an escape from provincial life
in <year> in a last attempt to be a serious artist he took a studio in munich
he left munich abruptly in <year> after he disrupted a variety show and subsequently made a scene through the effects of alcohol the <year> nine episode illustrated tale eight sheets in the wind describes how humans behave like animals when drunk
busch 's biographer weissweiler felt the story was only superficially funny and harmless but was a study on addiction and its induced state of delusion
busch appointed dresden publisher heinrich richter the son of saxon painter ludwig richter as his new publisher — richter 's press up to that time was producing children 's books and religious christian devotional literature
busch could choose themes although richter raised some concerns regarding four suggested illustrated tales that were proposed
however some were published in the <year> as bilderpossen proving a failure
busch then offered richter the manuscripts of max and moritz waiving any fees
richter rejected the manuscript as sales prospects seemed poor
busch 's former publisher braun purchased the right to max and moritz for <num> @,@ <num> gulden corresponding to approximately double the annual wage of a craftsman
for braun the manuscript was fortuitous
initially the sales of max and moritz were slow but sales figures improved after the <year> second edition
overall there were <num> editions and more than <num> @,@ <num> copies sold up to busch 's death in <year>
despite at first being ignored by critics teachers in the <num> described max and moritz as frivolous and an undesirable influence on the moral development of young people
busch had decided to leave munich as only few relatives lived there and the artists association was temporarily disbanded
in june <year> busch met his brother otto for the first time in frankfurt
otto was working as a tutor to the family of a wealthy banker and industrialist kessler
busch became friends with kessler 's wife johanna a mother of seven and an influential art and music patron of frankfurt
she regularly opened salons at her villa frequented by artists musicians and philosophers
she believed busch to be a great painter a view supported by anton burger a leading painter of the kronberger malerkolonie the kronberg @-@ based group of painters
while his humorous drawings did not appeal to her she supported his painting career
at first she established an apartment and studio for busch in her villa later providing him with an apartment nearby
motivated by kessler 's support and admiration and introduction to the cultural life of frankfurt the frankfurter years were the most artistically productive for busch
at this time he and otto discovered the philosophical works of arthur schopenhauer
busch did not remain in frankfurt
towards the end of the <num> he alternated between wiedensahl and lüthorst and wolfenbüttel where his brother gustav lived
the association with johanna kessler lasted five years and after his return to wiedensahl in <year> they communicated by letter
this contact was interrupted between <year> and <year> after which it was revived with the help of kessler 's daughters
he refused invitations to parties and publisher otto basserman sent him to wiedensahl to keep his alcohol problem undetected from those around him
busch was also a heavy smoker resulting in symptoms of severe nicotine poisoning in <year>
he began to illustrate drunkards more often
dutch writer marie anderson corresponded with busch
more than fifty letters were exchanged between january and october <year> in which they discussed philosophy religion and ethics
although only one anderson letter survives busch 's letters are in manuscripts
they met in mainz in october <year> after which he returned to basserman at heidelback in a horrible mood
according to several people at the time busch 's failure to find a wife was responsible for his conspicuous behaviour
there is no evidence that busch had a close relationship with any woman after that with anderson
busch lived with his sister fanny 's family after her husband pastor hermann nöldeke 's death in <year>
his nephew adolf nöldeke remembers that busch wanted to move back to wiedensahl with the family
busch renovated the house which fanny looked after even though he was a rich man and became father to his three young nephews
she would however have preferred to live in a more urban area for the education of her sons
for fanny and her three sons busch could not replace their former idyllic life
the years around <year> were psychically and emotionally exhausting for busch who was still reliant on alcohol
he would not invite visitors to wiedensahl because of this fanny lost contact with her friends in the village and whenever she questioned his wishes busch became furious even his friends otto friedrich bassermann franz von lenbach hermann levi and wilhelm von kaulbach were not invited he would meet them in kassel or hanover
busch stopped painting in <year> and signed @-@ over all publication rights to bassermann verlag for <num> @,@ <num> gold marks
busch now aged <num> felt old
he needed spectacles for writing and painting and his hands trembled slightly
in <year> together with his aging sister fanny nöldeke he accepted bassermann 's suggestion to move into a large parsonage in mechtshausen
busch read biographies novels and stories in german english and french
he organized his works and wrote letters and poems
most of the poems from the collections schein und sein and zu guter letzt were written in <year>
the following years were eventless for busch
he developed a sore throat in early january <year> and his doctor detected a weak heart
during the night of <num> – <num> january <year> busch slept uneasily taking camphor and a few drops of morphine as a tranquilizer
busch died the following morning before his physician called by otto nöldeke came to assist
their anti @-@ clerical themes proved popular during the kulturkampf
busch 's satires typically did not address political questions but exaggerated churcheyness superstition and philistine double @-@ standards
this exaggeration made at least two of the works historically erroneous
the third illustrated satire father filucius pater filucius described by busch as an allegorical mayfly has greater historical context
it was released by the publisher moritz schauenburg at the time pope pius ix proclaimed the dogma of papal infallibility that was harshly criticized by protestants
the publisher 's works were heavily scrutinized or censored and the state 's attorney in offenburg charged schauenberg with vilification of religion and offending public decency through indecent writings — a decision which affected busch
scenes of antonius accompanied by a pig being admitted to heaven and the devil being shown as a half @-@ naked ballet dancer seducing antonius were deemed controversial
the district court of düsseldorf subsequently banned saint antonius
schauenburg was acquitted on <num> march <year> in offenburg but in austria the satire 's distribution was prohibited until <year>
schauenburg refused to publish further busch satires to avoid future accusations
busch 's following work helen who couldn 't help it die fromme helene was published by otto friedrich bassermann a friend whom busch met in munich
helen who couldn 't help it which was soon translated into other european languages satirizes religious hypocrisy and dubious morality many details from helen who couldn 't help it criticizes the way of life of the kesslers
johanna kessler was married to a much older man and entrusted her children to governesses and tutors while she played an active role in the social life of frankfurt
the character of mr
schmock — the name based on the yiddish insult schmuck — shows similarities with johanna kessler 's husband who was uninterested in art and culture
in the second part of helen who couldn 't help it busch attacks catholic pilgrimages
the childless helen goes on a pilgrimage accompanied by her cousin and catholic priest franz
the pilgrimage is successful as later helen gives birth to twins who resemble helen and franz
franz is later killed by a jealous valet jean for his interest in female kitchen staff
the now widowed helen is left with only a rosary prayer book and alcohol
drunk she falls into a burning oil lamp
finally nolte coins a moral phrase echoing the philosophy of schopenhauer pater filucius father filucius is the only illustrated satire of this period suggested by the publisher
also aimed at anti @-@ catholic taste and buyers it criticizes the jesuit order
kraus felt it was the weakest of all three anti @-@ clerical works
some satires refer to contemporary events such as monsieur jacques à paris during the siege of <year> monsieur jacques à paris während der belagerung von <year>
busch biographer manuela diers declares the story tasteless work drawing on anti @-@ french emotions and mocking the misery of french people in paris which is occupied by prussian troops
it depicts an increasingly desperate french citizen who at first eats a mouse during the german siege then amputates his dog 's tail to cook it and finally invents an explosion pill which kills his dog and two fellow citizens
weissweiler believes that busch wrote with irony
in eginhard and emma <year> a fictional family story that takes place in the charlemagne era he criticizes the holy roman empire and calls for a german empire in its place in the birthday or the particularists der geburtstag oder die partikularisten he satirizes the anti @-@ prussian sentiments of his hanover countrymen
contemporary reception for the collection of <num> poems was mainly poor it was criticized for its focus on marriage and sexuality
his long @-@ time friend paul lindau called it very serious heartfelt charming poems
dutch writer marie anderson was one of few people who enjoyed his kritik des herzens and even planned to publish it in a dutch newspaper
in <year> he produced the short illustrated tale diddle @-@ boom dideldum
following in <year> was the knopp trilogy about the life of tobias knopp adventures of a bachelor abenteuer eines junggesellen mr
and mrs
knopp herr und frau knopp <year> and julie julchen <year>
the antagonists of the trilogy are not pairs of nuisances as with max and moritz or jack crook bird of evil hans huckebein der unglücksrabe
without pathos busch makes knopp become aware of his mortality in the first part of the trilogy knopp is depressed and will look for a wife
he visits his old friends and their wives who he finds in unenviable relationships
still not convinced that the life of a bachelor is one for him he returns home and without further ado proposes to his housekeeper
the following marriage proposal is according to busch biographer joseph kraus one of the shortest in the history of german literature according to wessling busch became skeptical of marriage after writing the story
to marie anderson he wrote i will never marry
i am already in good hands with my sister
both stories begin with a preface which for biographer joseph kraus were bravura pieces of komische lyrik — german comic poetry
clement dove ridicules the bourgeois amateur poet circle of munich the crocodiles die krokodile and their prominent members emanuel geibel paul von heyse and adolf wilbrandt
painter squirtle criticizes the bourgeois art connoisseur who believes the worth of art is gauged by its price
the prose play edwards dream eduards traum was released in <year> composed of several small grouped episodes rather than one linear storyline
the work received mixed reception
joseph kraus felt it was the peak of busch 's life 's work his nephews called it a masterwork of world literature and the publisher of a critical collective edition spoke of a narrative style that is not found in contemporary literature
eva weissweiler saw in the play busch 's attempt to prove himself in the novella genre believing that everything that angered or insulted him and his accompanying emotional depths are apparent in the story
the <year> story the butterfly der schmetterling parodies themes and motifs and ridicules the religious optimism of a german romanticism which contradicted busch 's realistic anthropology influenced by schopenhauer and charles darwin
its prose is more stringent in narrative style compared to edwards dream
both were not popular amongst readers because of their unfamiliar style
he regarded few of his paintings as finished often stacking them one on top of the other in damp corners of his studio where they stuck together
if the pile of paintings became too high he burnt some in his garden
since only a few remaining pictures are dated categorizing them is difficult
his doubts regarding his skills are expressed in his choice of materials
his ground was usually chosen carelessly
sometimes he used uneven cardboard or poorly @-@ prepared spruce @-@ wood boards
one exception is a portrait of johanna kessler on a canvas support measuring <num> centimetres <num> in by <num> centimetres <num> in one of his largest paintings
most of his works even landscapes are small
as busch used poor grounds and colours most are heavily darkened and have an almost monochrome effect
many pictures depict the countryside at wiedensahl and lüthorst
they include pollarded willows cottages in cornfields cowherds autumn landscapes and meadows with streams
a particular feature is the use of red jackets found in about <num> of <num> busch paintings and drawings
the muted or bright red coats are worn usually by a small figure depicted from behind
the paintings generally represent typical villages
portraits of the kesslers and a series of other portraits depicting lina weissenborn in the mid @-@ <num> are exceptions
a painting of a <num> @-@ year @-@ old girl from a jewish family at lüthorst portrays her as serious and having dark oriental features
the influence of dutch painters is clearly visible in busch 's work
hals diluted and shortened
but still halsian wrote paul klee after visiting a busch memorial exhibition in <year>
a strong influence on busch was adriaen brouwer whose themes were farming and inn life rustic dances card players smokers drunkards and rowdies
he dismissed the techniques of impressionism with its strong preoccupation with the effect of light and used new colours such as aniline yellow and photographs as an aid
the landscapes from the mid @-@ <num> show the same broad brushstrokes as seen in the paintings of the young franz von lenbach
busch refused to exhibit work even though he was befriended by many artists of the munich school which would have allowed him to do so it was not until near the end of his life that he presented his paintings to the public
he points out however that this classification is a simplification as some works by their nature can be of a later or earlier period
all three periods show busch 's obsession with german middle class life
his peasants are devoid of sensitivity and village life is marked by a vivid lack of sentiment
from <year> to <year> busch chiefly worked for the fliegenden blätter and the münchener bilderbogen
the period from <year> to <year> is characterized by his major illustrated stories such as helen who couldn 't help it
these stories are different in theme from works of his earlier period
the life of his characters start well but disintegrate as in painter squirtle maler klecksel someone sensitive who becomes a pedant
others concern recalcitrant children or animals or make the great or significant foolish and ridiculous
the early stories follow the pattern of children 's books of orthodox education such as those by heinrich hoffmann 's struwwelpeter that aim to teach the devastating consequences of bad behaviour
busch did not assign value to his work as he once explained to heinrich richter i look at my things for what they are as nuremberg trinkets toys as schnurr pfeiferen worthless and useless things whose value is to be found not in its artistic content but in public demand

from <year> until his death in <year> his work was dominated by prose and poems
the <year> prose text der schmetterling contains autobiographical accounts
peter 's enchantment by the witch lucinde of whom he regards himself a slave is possibly in reference to johanna kessler
peter like busch returns to his birthplace
it is similar in style to the romantic travel story that ludwig tieck established with his <year> franz sternbald 's wanderungen
busch plays with its traditional forms motifs pictures literary topics and form of narration
this letterpress printing technique was developed by english graphic artist thomas bewick near the end of the <num> century and became the most widely used reproduction system for illustrations over the years
busch insisted on first making the drawings afterwards writing the verse
surviving preparatory drawings show line notes ideas and movement and physiognomy studies
the draft was then transferred by pencil on white @-@ primed panels of hardwood end grain
not only was it hard work but the quality of the printing block was crucial
everything left white on the block around busch 's drawn lines was cut from the plate by skilled engravers
wood engraving allows a finer differentiation than woodcut and the potential tonal values are of almost the quality of intaglio printing such as copper engraving
sometimes the result was not satisfactory leading busch to rework or reproduce plates
the wood engraving technique did not allow for fine lines which is why busch 's drawing especially in his illustrated tales up to the mid @-@ <num> are boldly drawn giving his work its particular characteristic
from the mid @-@ <num> busch 's illustrations were printed using zincography
with this technique there was no longer any danger that a wood engraver could change the character of his drawings
the originals were photographed and transferred onto a photosensitive zinc plate
this process allowed for the application of a clear free pen @-@ drawn ink line and was a much faster printing method
busch 's use of zincography began with mr
and mrs
knopp
his language had an influence on the humorous poetry of erich kästner kurt tucholsky joachim ringelnatz and christian morgenstern
the contrast in his later work between comic illustration and its seemingly serious accompanying text — already demonstrated in his earlier max and moritz — is shown in widow bolte 's mawkish dignity which is disproportionate to the loss of her chickens many of brusch 's couplets part of contemporary common usage give the impression of weighty wisdom but in his hands become only apparent truths hypocrisy or platitudes
his use of onomatopoeia is a characteristic of his work allez @-@ oop @-@ da — max and moritz steal fried chickens with a fishing rod down a chimney — reeker @-@ rawker at the plank from bank to bank rickle @-@ rackle hear the millstones grind and crackle and tinkly @-@ clinket as eric the cat rips a chandelier from a ceiling in helen who couldn 't help it
busch uses names he gives characters to describe their personality
studiosus döppe young bumbel has little mental ability sauerbrots sourdough would not be of a cheerful disposition and förster knarrtje forester knarrtje could hardly be a socialite
many of his picture stories use verses with trochee structure the overweighting of the stressed syllables strengthens the humour of the lines
busch also uses dactyls where one accented syllable is followed by two unaccented syllables as in his plisch und plum where they underline the pedantic and solemn words with which teacher bokelmann educates his pupils
they create tension in the sourdough chapter from adventures of a bachelor through the alternation of trochees and dactyls
busch often synchronizes format and content in his poems as in fips the monkey where he uses the epic hexameter in a speech about wisdom
in both his illustrations and poems busch uses familiar fables occasionally appropriating their morality and stories spinning them to illustrate a very different and comic truth and bringing to bear his pessimistic view of the world and human condition
while traditional fables follow the typical philosophy of differentiating between good and evil behaviour busch combines both
sharp pencils pierced through models housewives fall onto kitchen knives thieves are spiked by umbrellas tailors cut their tormentors with scissors rascals are ground in corn mills drunkards burn and cats dogs and monkeys defecate while being tormented
busch has been frequently called a sadist by educators and psychologists
tails that are burnt pulled off trapped stretched or eaten is seen by weissweiler as not aggression against animals but a phallic allusion to busch 's undeveloped sexual life
such graphic text and imagery in cartoon form was not unusual at the time and publishers the public or censors found it not particularly noteworthy
topics and motifs for his early work were derived from <num> and <num> @-@ century popular literature the gruesome endings of which he often softened
caning a common aspect of <num> @-@ century teaching is prevalent in many of his works for example meister druff in adventures of a bachelor and lehrer bokelmann in plish and plum where is shown an almost sexual pleasure in applying punishment
beatings and humiliation are found in his later work too biographer gudrun schury described this as busch 's life @-@ motif
in the estate of busch there is the note durch die kinderjahre hindurchgeprügelt beaten through the childhood years however there is no evidence that busch was referring to himself
he couldn 't recall any beating from his father
his uncle kleine beat him once not with the conventional rattan stick but symbolically with dried dahlia stalks this for stuffing cow hairs into a village idiot 's pipe
weissweiler observes that busch probably saw canings at his village school where he went for three years and quite possibly also received this punishment
in abenteuer eines junggesellen busch illustrates a form of nonviolent progressive education that fails in one scene and caning in the following scene the canings that ensued indicate busch 's pessimistic picture of life which has its roots in the protestant ethic of the <num> century in which he believed that man is inherently evil and will never master his vices
civilisation is the aim of education but it can only mask man 's instincts superficially
gentleness only leads to a continuation of man 's misdeeds therefore punishment is required even if he retains his unrepentant character becomes a trained puppet or in extreme cases dies
these criticisms saw a separation of capital into what was construed as raffendes speculative capital and what constituted constructive creative production capital
the good native and german manufacturer was praised by antisemitic agitators such as theodor fritsch who opposed what he saw as rapacious greedy blood @-@ sucking jewish financial capitalism in the form of plutocrats and usurers
busch was thought to have embraced those stereotypes
two passages are often underlined one in helen who couldn 't help it robert gernhardt defended busch by stating that jews are satirized only in three passages of which the oldest is an illustration of a text by another author published in <year>
he stated that busch 's jewish figures are merely stereotypical one of a number of stereotypes such as the limited bavarian farmer and the prussian tourist
joseph kraus shares the same view and uses a couplet from eight sheets in the wind die haarbeutel in which profit @-@ seeking people are although gernhardt felt that jews for busch were alien the jewish conductor hermann levi befriended him suggesting that busch had a slight bias towards jews
the publisher eduard daelen also an artist and writer echoed busch 's anti @-@ catholic bias putting him on equal footing with leonardo da vinci peter paul rubens and gottfried wilhelm leibniz and uncritically quoting correspondences
even busch and his friends were embarrassed
literary scholar friedrich theodor vischer attacked daelen 's biography and called him the envious eunuch of the desiccated philistine
after reading this biography johannes proelß posted an essay in the frankfurter zeitung which contained many biographical falsehoods — as a response to this busch wrote two articles in the same newspaper
published in october and december <year> the autobiographical essay regarding myself was mich betrifft includes basic facts and some description of his troubles analysts see within the essay a deep identity crisis
busch revised his autobiography over the following years
the last such essay was published under the title from me about me von mir über mich which includes fewer biographical details and less reflection on bitterness and amusement than regarding myself
over <num> @,@ <num> congratulatory messages were sent to mechtshausen from around the world
wilhelm ii praised the poet and artist whose exquisite works are full of genuine humour and are everlasting for the german people
the austrian alldeutsche vereinigung pan @-@ german association repealed the ban on der heilige antonius von padua
verlag braun schneider who owned the rights of max and moritz gave busch <num> @,@ <num> reichsmark around € <num> @,@ <num> or <num> @,@ <num> which was donated to two hospitals in hanover
since then on the dates of his birth and death he has been celebrated frequently
during the <num> anniversary in <year> there were numerous re @-@ publications of busch works
deutsche post issued stamps depicting the busch character hans huckebein — itself the inspiration for the nickname of the never @-@ built focke @-@ wulf ta <num> german jet fighter design of <year> — and the german republic minted a <num> euro silver coin faced with his portrait
hanover declared <year> the wilhelm busch year with images featuring busch works erected within the city centre
the wilhelm busch prize is awarded annually for satirical and humorous poetry
the wilhelm busch society active since <year> aims to
collect scientifically revise and promote wilhelm busch 's works with the public
it supports the development of caricature and satirical artwork as a recognized branch of the visual arts
it is an advocate of the wilhelm busch museum
memorials are located in places he lived including wiedensahl ebergötzen lüthorst mechtshausen and hattorf am harz
knigge described busch as the first virtuoso of illustrated stories
from the second half of the <num> century he was considered the forefather of comics
his early illustrations differ from those of the colleagues of kaspar braun
they show an increasing focus on protagonists are less detailed in drawing and atmosphere and develop from a dramatic understanding of the whole story
all busch 's illustrated tales have a plot that firstly describes the circumstance then a resulting conflict then solution
plots are developed through consecutive scenes similar to film storyboards
busch conveys an impression of movement and action at times strengthened through a change of perspective
according to gert ueding his depiction of movement is unique
one of busch 's notable stories is der virtuos <year> which describes the life of a pianist who plays privately for an excited listener
satirizing the self @-@ publicizing artist 's attitude and his overblown adoration it varies from busch 's other stories as each scene does not contain prose but is defined with music terminology such as introduzione maestoso and fortissimo vivacissimo
as the scenes increase in tempo each part of his body and lappet run around
the penultimate scene again depicts the pianist 's movements with score sheets floating above the grand piano on which musical notes are dancing
over the years graphic artists have been fascinated by der virtuos
august macke in a letter to gallery owner herwarth walden described busch as the first futurist stating how well he captured time and movement
similar pioneering scenes are in bilder zur jobsiade <year>
job fails to answer rather easy questions set by twelve clergy who shake their heads in synchronicity
each scene is a movement study that presages eadweard muybridge 's photography
muybridge began his work in <year> not released until <year>
several countries banned the story – about <year> the styrian school board prohibited sales of max and moritz to teens under eighteen
by <year> more than <num> dialect and language translations had been produced
some early moritzian comic strips were heavily influenced by busch in plot and narrative style
tootle and bootle <year> borrowed so much content from max and moritz that it was described as a pirate edition
the true moritzian recreation is the katzenjammer kids by german artist rudolph dirks published in the new york journal from <year>
it was published though william randolph hearst 's suggestion that a pair of siblings following the pattern of max and moritz should be created
the katzenjammer kids is regarded as one of the oldest continuous comic strips
german moritzian -inspired stories include lies und lene die schwestern von max und moritz hulda levetzow f
maddalena <year> schlumperfritz und schlamperfranz <year> sigismund und waldemar des max und moritz zwillingspaar walther günther <year> and mac und mufti thomas ahlers volker dehs <year>
these are shaped by observations of the first and second world wars while the original is a moral story
in <year> the christian democratic union used the max and moritz characters for a campaign in north rhine @-@ westphalia the same year that the east german satirical magazine eulenspiegel used them to caricature black labour
in <year> max and moritz participated in late <num> student activism
designed by catalan artist jaume plensa and executed by krueck and sexton architects it opened in july <year>
the fountain is composed of a black granite reflecting pool placed between a pair of glass brick towers
the towers are <num> feet <num>
<num> m tall and they use light @-@ emitting diodes leds to display digital videos on their inward faces
construction and design of the crown fountain cost <num> million
the water operates from may to october intermittently cascading down the two towers and spouting through a nozzle on each tower 's front face
residents and critics have praised the fountain for its artistic and entertainment features
it highlights plensa 's themes of dualism light and water extending the use of video technology from his prior works
its use of water is unique among chicago 's many fountains in that it promotes physical interaction between the public and the water
both the fountain and millennium park are highly accessible because of their universal design
crown fountain has been one of the most controversial of all the millennium park features
before it was even built some were concerned that the sculpture 's height violated the aesthetic tradition of the park
after construction surveillance cameras were installed atop the fountain which led to a public outcry and their quick removal
however the fountain has survived its contentious beginnings to find its way into chicago pop culture
it is a popular subject for photographers and a common gathering place
while some of the videos displayed are of scenery most attention has focused on its video clips of local residents hundreds of chicagoans visit the fountain hoping to see themselves appearing on one of the fountain 's two screens
the fountain is a public play area and offers people an escape from summer heat allowing children to frolic in the fountain 's water
its northwest corner had been illinois central rail yards and parking lots until <year> when it was made available for development by the city as millennium park
millennium park was conceived in <year> as the capstone of grant park to celebrate the new millennium and to feature world @-@ renowned architects artists designers landscape architects and urban planners
as of <year> millennium park trails only navy pier as a chicago tourist attraction
the fountain is centrally located in chicago it is east of michigan avenue and its historic michigan boulevard district north of monroe street and the art institute of chicago and south of madison street
looking north from the fountain viewers see some of the tallest buildings in the united states aon center two prudential plaza and one prudential plaza
unlike other park feature sponsors the crowns acted independently of millennium park officials they conducted independent surveys of water technologies held their own informal design contest and stayed active in the design and engineering of the project
the crowns were open @-@ minded about the choice of artist wanting a modern work they solicited proposals from a list of prospective artists and architects
jaume plensa researched the traditions and history of fountains and studied anthropomorphism in fountain imagery
some of his early ideas for the project referenced buckingham fountain but these were soon abandoned
his presentation to the crown family started with a slide show of fountains from the middle ages through the <num> century
plensa focused on the philosophical meanings associated with fountains their history use and art
his presentation included computer animation of facial expressions
the other finalists were maya lin who presented a low @-@ height horizontal form and robert venturi who presented a fountain that would have been <num> feet <num> m tall
in january <year> plensa won the commission to design the fountain over lin and venturi
the installation is a video sculpture commissioned to operate thirty years
in the <num> he completed several outdoor sculptures in which he explored the use of light the star of david <year> at stockholm 's raoul wallenberg square bridge of light <year> in jerusalem and led technology video and computer design gläserne seele mr
net in brandenburg <year> – <year>
in his public art plensa challenged himself to involve the viewer with his art which led to his conception of the crown fountain
his objective was to create a socially relevant interactive fountain for the 21st century
since water is the focus of a fountain and since chicago and especially millennium park is so greatly affected by the nearby waterfront plensa sought to create an eternal water work to complement the local natural inspirations
because of the colder winters common to the climate of chicago plensa created a fountain that would remain vibrant when the water was inactive in the wintertime so the fountain is an experience of light themes and the use of video technology
plensa explores dualism with crown fountain where he has two randomly selected faces conversing with each other
plensa feels that by using faces he can represent the diversity of the city both in ethnicity and in age
the artist intends to portray the sociocultural evolution of the city by updating the collection of images
his representation has become a part of the city 's pop culture the first few episodes of the first season of prison break featured shots of the fountain
plensa feels that the challenge in the creation of successful work of public art is to integrate the viewer into an interactive relationship with the art
the fountain is known for encouraging its visitors to splash and slide in the reflecting pool jostle for position under the water spout and place themselves under the cascade
this interactivity was to some degree accidental
although the city planned for some interactivity the transformation of the fountain into a water park for kids within hours of opening surprised plensa
now when the national weather service issues summer heat advisories and the governor of illinois declares state office buildings as official daytime cooling centers the national press points to crown fountain as a respite for inhabitants of the chicago metropolitan area
the subjects were chosen from local schools churches and community groups and filming began in <year> at the downtown campus of the school of the art institute of chicago saic
the saic students filmed their subjects with a <num> @,@ <num> high @-@ definition hdw @-@ f900 video camera the same model used in the production of the three star wars prequels
about <num> saic students took part in what became an informal master 's course in public art for the project
faculty from columbia college chicago was also involved in the production of the video
the high @-@ definition equipment was used because of the scale of the project
because the image proportions were like a movie screen with a width far exceeding its height the camera was turned on its side during filming
each face appears on the sculpture for a total of <num> minutes using various parts of individual <num> @-@ second videos
a <num> @-@ second section is played at one @-@ third speed forward and backward running for a total of <num> minutes
then there is a subsequent segment where the mouth is puckering that is stretched to <num> seconds
this is followed by a section in which the water appears to spout from the open mouth that is stretched to last for <num> seconds
finally there is a smile after the completion of the water spouting from the mouth that is slowed to extend for <num> seconds
of the original <num> @,@ <num> subjects filmed <num> videos were determined to be usable for the project
originally the set of images was presumed to be the beginning of a work in progress but as of <year> no additional videos are planned
to achieve the effect in which water appears to be flowing from subjects mouths each video has a segment where the subject 's lips are puckered which is then timed to correspond to the spouting water reminiscent of gargoyle fountains
each face is cropped so that no hair and usually no ears are visible
since there is no tripod designed for cameras turned on their sides an adjustable barber dentist 's chair was used to minimize the need for the movement of the state @-@ of @-@ the @-@ art camera during filming
nonetheless in some case digital manipulation was necessary to properly simulate puckering in the exact proper location on the video
many of the faces had to be stretched in order to get the mouths properly positioned
additionally each video was color @-@ corrected for brightness contrast and color saturation
both the playback equipment and the final videos had to be further adjusted to account for sunlight during viewing
the goodman family known for funding the goodman theatre was also a large contributor the entire <num> million cost was provided by private donations
the initial proposed cost for the fountain had been <num> million
after two architectural firms refused the contract to make plensa 's design a reality the firm krueck and sexton architects accepted
public art was a departure from krueck sexton 's residential and corporate office @-@ dominated portfolio which includes buildings like the spertus institute
collaboration between the artist architectural team and consultants proved to be crucial to the success of the project
the fountain 's black granite reflecting pool measures <num> by <num> feet <num> by <num> m and has an approximate water depth of <num>
<num> inches <num>
<num> mm
it displays videos on two led screens each encapsulated in a glass brick tower measuring <num> by <num> by <num> feet <num>
<num> by <num>
<num> by <num>

the firm designed a special stainless steel t @-@ frame both to bear the load of the walls which are <num> feet <num> m high and to withstand lateral wind forces
the frame holds all the glass blocks and transfers the load to the base in a zigzag pattern
rods measuring <num>
<num> inches <num> mm in diameter anchor to the structure and project into the frame for lateral stability while triangular corner brackets add support
after several dozen glass manufacturing firms were interviewed l
e
smith glass company emerged as the company to produce <num> @,@ <num> glass blocks near the upper limit of the size of press glass formed from hand @-@ poured molten glass and cast iron molds
the process used sand and soda ash heated to a temperature of <num> @,@ <num> ° f <num> @,@ <num> ° c and gathered with a large clay ball resembling a honey dipper
rather than use a standard plunger to ensure the glass that sagged off the rod spread to the corners of the mold they relied on gravity
the full mold was annealed reheated in an oven to <num> @,@ <num> ° f <num> ° c and cooled
over the course of four months of production about <num> blocks were produced per day
the glass was custom @-@ made at a factory in mount pleasant pennsylvania and shipped to the structural glass panel manufacturer in melbourne florida
the panels were then shipped by truck to chicago
the glass is white glass rather than the usual green glass that results from iron impurities
this has the tradeoff of increased image clarity but greater dirt visibility
each block is <num> by <num> by <num> inches <num> by <num> by <num> mm with glass thin enough to avoid image distortion
on each block one of the six faces is polished and the other five surfaces are textured
the structure for the blocks was a challenge
at first the design team had considered switching to plastic blocks until the team found circle redmont inc
a prefabricated glass panel company in melbourne florida which specializes in structural glass panel systems
circle redmont came up with the plan of turning grates on their sides to be used as building elements
the individual grids are <num> feet <num>
<num> m tall and either <num> feet <num>
<num> m or <num> feet <num>
<num> m wide with cell capacity of an average of <num> blocks
each tower is composed of <num> grids stacked and welded
the combination of the refraction of the glass and the thinness of the metal make the grid virtually invisible
the fountain uses <num> @,@ <num> imperial gallons <num> @,@ <num> l per hour <num> of which is recycled back into the system
getting the water to the spout took ingenuity
although consideration was given to omitting a led tile it was determined that the images would then look as though they were each missing a tooth
instead one tile in each tower is recessed about <num> inches <num> mm to allow the installation of <num> inch <num> mm clear tubing for the water nozzle
the water regularly spills over the fountain and down the sides of the towers and intermittently spouts from the nozzle
two essential custom fittings contribute to the artistic vision of the fountain a custom glass block at the upper edge for guiding the water 's descent while remaining unobtrusive and a plastic nozzle fitted to the stainless steel frame to control the rate of water flow and reduce liability to the city for any injuries sustained by the fountain 's interactive participants
the interactive participants are usually children playing in the stream from the water spout or under the cascade
the risk that the spouting water would knock people down made the design both a legal and a physical challenge
the fountains use over one million leds
the inner surface of each tower uses <num> smaller screens with a total of <num> @,@ <num> led points each with two red one blue and two green leds
the physical demands of led screens in particular the red green and blue long @-@ life light bulbs and the requisite circuitry created three major challenges supporting the physical structure combating heat buildup and optimizing perceptibility of the display
plensa had used led fixtures on previous projects and thus had some experience with these issues
the led structure is not supported as a single wall which would be <num> feet <num> m high but rather as several segments that are noticeable as visible horizontal bands every few feet these show where the led equipment is supported
the heat generated is handled by fans that cool the air at the bottom that then works its way through the chimney @-@ like tower
perceptibility was determined to be optimal with led lights <num> inches <num> mm behind the glass
leds were chosen because they were viewed as the lowest maintenance option of the possible color changing fixtures
leds fit into an electrical circuit causing illumination by the movement of electrons in the semiconductor material and making a filament unnecessary so the bulbs never burn out and do not get too hot
fins were added to the screens to keep direct sunlight from hitting the leds
color kinetics now part of philips solid @-@ state lighting solutions which is now called philips color kinetics colorblast <num> leds fixtures are used to illuminate the tower structures and glass in an attempt to meet plensa 's objective that the towers have a light and translucent appearance with their internal structures reflecting light from behind the glass surface
the electronics were designed to be adaptable to the time of day weather and season and to meet the desired century @-@ long longevity and dependability objectives set by the design team in response to the thirty @-@ year directive
the <num> @,@ <num> @-@ square @-@ foot <num>
<num> <num> pool used <num> by <num> feet <num>
<num> by <num>
<num> m pavers that weigh <num> pounds <num> kg
the pavers were rested on screw jack pedestals in order to be leveled and shimmed
the pavers had to be perfectly leveled for the water to work correctly because the fountain incorporates numerous sensors to regulate the flow and level of the water
during construction the underground parking garage remained open
an additional challenge was designing the structure to facilitate interior access for ongoing maintenance and repairs while accommodating two levels of underground parking underneath
the challenge was solved by combining a t @-@ bar grid to absorb weight with about <num> outriggers or tiebacks inserted through the video wall to support the glass blocks and absorb wind loads
this design allows for the removal of individual glass blocks for cleaning or repair without disruption to the display
the filtered air inside the towers helps minimize the need for cleaning
crown fountain 's design not only included interior access for technical repairs but also incorporated exemplary non @-@ discriminatory barrier @-@ free accessibility because its interactivity is not limited to the able @-@ bodied
the force of the water accounts for the entire range of possible interactive visitors
originally plensa had planned to have each face appear for <num> minutes and this continued to be the targeted duration when the testing of the sculpture occurred
eventually professors at the school of the art institute of chicago convinced him to use only five @-@ minute videos
plensa 's design of crown fountain was unveiled to the public on july <num> – <num> during the <year> grand opening celebrations for millennium park which was sponsored by j
p
morgan chase co
at the time of the unveiling crown fountain like the nearby cloud gate was incomplete because only <num> of the videos had been refined for public display
it was officially dedicated on july <num> <year> as part of a special private fundraising party that raised <num> million for the millennium park conservancy fund
the room houses high @-@ definition video servers and equipment temperature sensors
hard drives contain all the individual electronic computer files of the face videos
generally the computer programs automatically perform tasks such as determining when the face will pucker and if weather conditions permit when to turn the water on and off
using low- rather than high @-@ resolution images was both less expensive and created a better display for the average viewer
a barco show controller selects the sequence of faces one at a time and determines a random tower lighting selection of one of eight led colors programmed into an electronic theatre controls etc emphasis control system
at night the etc system controls spotlights that illuminate the cascading water and that are dimmed by special wet @-@ use location ground fault circuit interrupters
the control room covers an area equal to <num> parking spaces in the underground parking garage which costs the city <num> @,@ <num> annually in terms of the opportunity cost of lost revenue in <year> dollars
maintenance issues for the fountain range from kids removing the adhesive between the bricks to pipes in need of maintenance
as of <year> annual upkeep costs were approximately <num> @,@ <num>
although the screens on the towers periodically display clips of landscapes such as waterfalls most intriguing are the display of faces of chicago residents
about <num> @,@ <num> faces of chicagoans are shown in a random rotation the order determined using a barco show controller
each face is displayed for five minutes with a brief period between each of these videos during which the sculpture is unlit
as a result no more than <num> faces appear per hour during the summer
however during the winter a version without the final one minute of puckering is shown so the video segments then are only four minutes each
the video pattern also includes a three @-@ minute water scene every half @-@ hour and a <num> @-@ second fade @-@ to @-@ black every <num> minutes
if all the faces were shown consecutively instead of randomly they would each appear about once every eight days
a june <year> article in the chicago sun @-@ times reported that many of the subjects who had their images digitized for the project had yet to either see their own images or hear of anyone who had seen them
the spouting water from the faces of the towers appears to be flowing from the displayed subject 's mouth from a <num> @-@ inch <num> mm nozzle located in the center of each interior face <num> feet <num>
<num> m above the reflecting pool
images are shown daily year @-@ round while the water feature only operates from may <num> to approximately october <num> weather permitting
the park is open to the public daily from <num> a
m
to <num> p
m
each tower is illuminated from within on three sides by approximately <num> color @-@ changing color kinetics led lighting fixtures per tower while the fourth side features opposing barco led display screens
at night some of the videos are replaced by images of nature or solid colors
also at night the other three sides of the fountain display changing colors
the outer color kinetics surfaces randomly display the translucent glow of one of eight colors along with each of the inner opposing faces
as a video sculpture with a variety of cascade and water spout fountain modes the sculpture is a fluid dynamic evolving artwork
when the videos are not on the front of the tower water cascades down each of the facades
the water is filtered pumped and recirculated through the fountain
dual pump rooms below each tower draw water from a reservoir beneath the reflecting pool
there are <num> mechanical pumps that are regulated from a control room in the underground parking garage beneath the south tower of the fountain
the water in the reflecting pool has a depth of about <num>
<num> millimetres <num>

grant park has been protected since <year> by forever open clear and free legislation that has been affirmed by four previous illinois supreme court rulings
aaron montgomery ward twice sued the city of chicago in the <num> to force it to remove buildings and structures from grant park and to keep it from building new ones
as a result the city has what are termed the montgomery ward height restrictions on buildings and structures in grant park
however crown fountain and jay pritzker pavilion which stands <num> feet <num> m tall were exempt from the height restriction because they were classified as works of art and not buildings or structures
in november <year> crown fountain became the focus of a public controversy when the city added surveillance cameras atop each tower
purchased through a <num> million department of homeland security grant to the chicago area the cameras were part of a surveillance system augmenting eight other cameras covering all of millennium park
the city said the cameras similar to those used throughout the city at high @-@ crime areas and traffic intersections were intended to remain on the towers for several months until permanent less intrusive replacements were secured
city officials had consulted the architects who collaborated with plensa on the tower designs but plensa himself had not been notified
public reaction was negative as bloggers and the artistic community decried the cameras on the towers as inappropriate and a blight
the city said that the cameras were largely for security reasons but also partly to help park officials monitor burnt @-@ out lights
the chicago tribune quickly published an article concerning the cameras as well as the public reaction and the cameras were removed the next day
plensa supported their removal
at the time there were plans to replace led lighting with incandescent bulbs on each of the non @-@ video display surfaces and to replace the video surface leds
plensa who maintained control of the video faces for the first two years of the fountain 's operation understands that future generations may wish to update the faces used in the rotation of videos to reflect changes in humanity going forward
in <year> an additional <num> faces were anticipated for <year>
crown fountain has more interactivity than other chicago fountains such as buckingham fountain and lorado taft 's fountain of the great lakes and fountain of time all but the last are in grant park
these other chicago fountains are traditional in that they discourage viewer touching buckingham fountain is surrounded by a fence and taft 's fountains are surrounded by moats
in contrast crown fountain provides an open invitation to play in the fountain 's water

the fountain is featured on the cover of philip jodidio 's <year> book architecture art
although plensa is considered to be a conceptual artist according to jodidio plensa created a work whose architectural aspects are paramount
its location juxtaposed with the historic michigan boulevard district 's skywall highlights these aspects
jodidio considers the work to be a modernization of the gargoyle theme and feels that the scale of the enlarged faces humanize the work and challenges the architecture
the towers are an integral part of the skyline that have achieved rare permanence for contemporary art
the dam is situated on the darling scarp and is an impoundment of the canning river
it is noted for its innovative structural and hydraulic design that was considered to be at the forefront of concrete gravity dam design at the time of construction
the canning dam was perth 's primary water supply up until the <num> when other sources of fresh water were tapped
currently the dam supplies approximately <num> percent of perth 's fresh water
inflow into the canning reservoir is estimated to be <num> gigalitres <num> @,@ <num> @,@ <num> cu ft and has a storage capacity of <num> @,@ <num> megalitres <num> @,@ <num>
<num> × <num> <num> cu ft
since its completion in <year> the canning dam has contributed to a wide range of environmental and ecological problems in surrounding regions problems include more common algal blooms habitat loss and sedimentation
despite these issues canning dam and the adjacent parks and forests provide a variety of recreational activities for the public such as bushwalking historic walks and picnic facilities
investigation of the site began in <year> when engineer thomas hodgson surveyed and proposed the dam 's current location as a possible site
however despite the recommendations of further inquiries and an extreme shortage of water in some years government funds were not allocated for the construction of a dam until the great depression in the <num>
in <year> a small pipehead dam was built <num> kilometres <num> mi downstream from the present canning dam
it was only intended as a quick fix to the water supply problem and it soon became apparent that a major reservoir was needed although it would be nine years before work on the current canning dam would begin
the new dam was completed in <year> at a cost of au £ <num>
<num> million
engineer russell dumas designed the dam and directed most of its construction
a further improvement was made in <year> when a concrete @-@ lined channel was constructed to divert stream flow from the nearby kangaroo gully catchment
the canning dam and reservoir was perth 's primary source of water until the boom growth of the city in the <num> and the completion of serpentine dam in <year>
in <year> the reservoir was connected to perth 's integrated water supply scheme by the canning tunnel
prior to its opening water had flowed through the canning contour channel to gosnells
the canning dam and reservoir still supplies approximately <num> percent of perth 's drinking water requirements and plays an important role in the context of the development of perth
the canning reservoir is also used to store water from the newly completed kwinana desalination plant
treated water can be pumped from the plant to the reservoir through the new forrestdale pumping station
the dam wall is situated in a narrow gorge running east and west with rock sides sloping upward from the river bed
behind the dam wall the south branch of the canning river joins the main stream with the impounded water forming a lake which stretches back in three major arms to the east south @-@ east and south
the catchment has an area of <num> square kilometres <num> sq mi
the reservoir is at <num> metres <num> ft ahd and the highest point of the catchment mount cooke is at <num> metres <num> @,@ <num> ft ahd
climatically the area receives about <num> millimetres <num> in of rainfall per annum with most of this falling between may and september
there is widespread variability of rainfall across the catchment however from between <num> and <num> @,@ <num> millimetres <num> and <num> in
since <year> long @-@ term average rainfalls at the dam wall have decreased by <num> percent and streamflow into the catchment by approximately <num> percent — the average annual inflow between <year> and <year> was <num> gigalitres <num>
<num> × <num> cu ft which had reduced to <num> gigalitres <num> @,@ <num> @,@ <num> cu ft between <year> and <year>
the project the biggest public works program of the decade stimulated significant growth in the local economy and provided desperately needed work for around five hundred men
several innovative design concepts and construction methods which were new to australia were introduced on the project while others which were used on the nearby wellington dam were improved upon at the canning dam site
at the canning dam and indeed all dams care had to be taken to prevent water seepage between the foundation rock and the structure of the dam
at the canning in addition to cutting back the foundation to solid unfractured rock a cut @-@ off trench was sited near the upstream face of the dam down stream which a rock filled drain containing open jointed pipes was provided to intercept any seepage between the rock face and the concrete of the dam
the inclusion of an internal drainage system was considered innovative at the period
near vertical tubular <num> in <num> mm cut @-@ off drains were provided at five @-@ foot <num>
<num> m intervals along the dam to relieve internal seepage through the concrete
while state of the art materials @-@ handling methods were used in some instances labour @-@ saving machinery worked beside operations intended to maximise the labour content
sustenance workers were employed chiefly for on @-@ site preparation road construction foundation excavation clearing timber from the reservoir basin and on some concreting operations
skilled workers were required on the dam for fixing the formwork where the concrete was poured
these workers were probably employed at normal day labour rates the main employment method used on the project
bulk handling of cement was also used for the first time in australia this saw a significant saving as opposed to bagged cement which was the standard practice of the day
generally construction work proceeded smoothly and from an engineering point of view there were few setbacks
however one did occur in the early stages of construction
in march <year> there was a violent storm bringing <num> mm <num>
<num> in of rain in less than two days
as a result the river rose rapidly which flooded the dam foundation workings
pumps had to be installed and work resumed three days later
the dam was completed in september <year>
when built it was the longest concrete gravity dam in australia and also the second highest after the burrinjuck dam in new south wales
as of <year> of the <num> large concrete and masonry gravity dams in australia the canning dam is still the fifth highest and the sixth longest
it is the largest concrete dam in western australia in terms of length of crest and volume of concrete
the final cost of the dam was significantly less than had been originally budgeted for and the work was completed on schedule to a date that was calculated seven years previously
investigations have shown that cracking was due to strong aar alkali aggregate reactivity in the concrete
aar results in swelling of the concrete which may cause secondary compressive stresses localised map cracks and ultimately structural cracks
in addition the concrete tensile strength and elasticity significantly decreases
many old concrete dams are known to suffer from aar including fontana dam in tennessee and pian telessio dam in italy among others
extensive remedial works were undertaken between <year> <year> to strengthen the dam wall
this work involved removing the top <num>
<num> m <num> ft of the existing dam wall and drilling blasting through the dam wall plus up to a further <num> m <num> ft into the bedrock below
the top section of the wall was then rebuilt using reinforced concrete
finally permanent re @-@ stressable ground anchors were then installed through the formed and drilled holes from the crest to be stressed and grouted into the foundation rock
at time of completion these were the largest capacity and longest permanent ground anchors ever installed in the world
an innovative drilling and blasting technique called penetrating cone fracture pcf was used in the remedial works process
pcf was chosen over conventional drilling and or blasting techniques due to the reduced risk of damage to the existing structure from vibration as well as lower noxious fume and dust levels
a number of freshwater fish species which are endemic to the south @-@ west of western australia are found in the canning river system however studies of fish and fish habitats in the area have shown that fish numbers are low due to a loss of habitat and a loss of linkage between breeding areas due to low flows preventing fish migrating upstream and reaching important breeding and nursery grounds
stagnant water caused by a lack of water flow has provided a suitable habitat for successful breeding of an introduced pest the mosquitofish
damming of the canning caused dramatic flow reductions that significantly altered downstream aquatic macroinvertebrate communities
the lack of water flow has also resulted in a poor flushing effect below the dam wall
an excessive amount of nutrients from fertilizers and animal waste has caused algal blooms and eutrophication
many river pools which are an important summer refuge and habitat for aquatic and terrestrial flora and fauna have been lost due to sedimentation and modification of the flow regime caused by impoundments in the canning river
periodic flooding of the canning river from the dam is required to disperse seed stimulate germination and ensure seedlings survive recharge shallow groundwater tables that are important during periods of drought and to discourage and prevent weed growth
however during times of low rainfall periodic flooding is reduced
canning dam features a number of picnic areas with gas barbecues look outs and historic walks – many with disabled access
bushwalking occurs throughout the catchment particularly along the bibbulmun track which passes through the catchment about <num> km upstream of canning dam
several mountain bike trails run either through the canning national park or adjacent state forest areas
the canning reservoir canning river and tributaries are illegally fished for marron especially during summer
boating fishing and swimming are prohibited in the reservoir for health and hygiene reasons
unauthorised camping including overnight stays and or outside of designated areas and unauthorised trail establishment occur more and more frequently in the canning catchment
midge was created along with skipper to counteract criticism that claimed barbie was a sex symbol
she was marketed as barbie 's best friend
no midge dolls were sold for the rest of the vintage years after the <num>
midge was re @-@ introduced in <year> as part of the play line though two vintage reproduction dolls were made specifically for collectors in <year> and <year>
the dolls sold in this time period usually had red hair often with freckles and her eye color was usually blue
also in the period wedding day midge was sold with the groom being alan sherwood who had been marketed as midge 's boyfriend in the vintage years
midge and alan had three children introduced named ryan nikki and cassandra
they also had twins who were never introduced
this was known as the happy family line and in the set midge was sold pregnant with nikki as a newborn baby
the happy family product became the subject of controversy when some parents disliked the pregnant midge toy because they believed that midge was too young to have children
in <year> mattel decided to revamp midge 's history reintroducing her as a best friend of barbie 's but unmarried without children and with no connection to alan
midge was the first same @-@ size friend of barbie ever sold and was created to oppose these controversies aimed at barbie
she had a fuller gentler face mold that was less sexually intimidating although her body proportions were the same as barbie and they both stood at <num> <num> ⁄ <num> inches <num> mm tall
this allowed the two dolls to be able to share clothes and accessories
her head mold was stamped <year> the same as barbie
when midge arrived the markings on the straight leg body mold they shared changed to include both her and barbie
midge had shoulder @-@ length hair that flipped at the ends
buyers had an option of buying a doll with one of three different hair colors red blond or brunette
her face was usually brushed with freckles
the dolls that were sold without freckles had a longer hair style and are now hard to find
depending on the doll 's hair color the color of her two @-@ piece swimming suit varied
if midge had red hair her swimsuit was yellow and orange for blond hair it was in two shades of blue and if she was brunette it was pink and red
the first vintage midge dolls had a value of <num> mib mint in box in <year>
for the first two years that midge was sold she had straight legs that could not bend at the knee
a rare midge with teeth was sold the first year and is now sought after by collectors
one year later in <year> the dolls that were sold had slightly longer hair
midge 's boyfriend allan arrived as well
early in <year> wigs wardrobe midge was sold and consisted of a midge head with short molded hair and three wigs
this was the midge counterpart of the fashion queen barbie
since she came with only a head another doll had to provide for the body
in <year> midge with bendable legs was introduced
she had shorter bobbed hair like the american girl barbie with a blue headband
her swimming suit was different as well and was now one @-@ piece and striped
the same steffie mold was used for cool times midge in <year>
in <year> she began to use the diva mold for all stars midge and the beat midge
in <year> she was married to allan now spelled alan
before and after the wedding day midge doll was sold many midge play line dolls were produced
before wedding day midge midge dolls still had freckles but up until hawaii midge was sold in <year> the dolls lacked freckles
most of the dolls were red @-@ haired with blue or green eyes but some dolls were brunette
the most commonly used head mold for midge in this period was the diva mold stamped <year>
a <num> anniversary midge reproduction doll was sold in <year> for collectors made to look like the vintage midge dolls
she had red hair was dressed in her original orange and lime two @-@ piece swimming suit and came with a reproduction of the senior prom outfit from <year> – <year> as well as a reproduction of the box the midge dolls originally came in
earlier in <year> for midge 's <num> anniversary a midge reproduction doll was also produced but she did not possess a reproduction of her original swimsuit or the original box
like the later version she came in a reproduction of the senior prom outfit
in <year> midge appeared on the webseries barbie life in the dreamhouse where it is revealed that she has moved to malibu
with this her canon has been changed extensively and she is a teenager who is retro at heart and still uses old @-@ fangled terms
the whole happy family canon has been dropped altogether due to controversy
two midge dolls will be released in <year> one is as part of a collectors set with barbie and the other on her own in the life in the dreamhouse doll line
however in <year> she and alan were re @-@ introduced with a family consisting of them and three different kids three @-@ year @-@ old ryan and newborn baby nikki
this was known as the happy family line and was similar to the discontinued heart family line of the <num>
the dolls came in both european american and african american versions
this was the first time an african american midge was ever produced
midge was sold pregnant with nikki who was a tiny baby inside midge 's magnetic removable womb
this led to some controversy with some consumers saying that the doll was inappropriate for children or that it promoted teen pregnancy
another cause for this controversy was that midge did not initially have a wedding ring but this was later fixed
she also was packaged without alan
customers complaining about the doll led to wal @-@ mart pulling the happy family line off their shelves
a new version of this midge was produced for wal @-@ mart this time not pregnant and with a cardboard cut @-@ out display of alan and ryan standing next to her inside the box
the happy family line included everything from a talking house a backyard swimming pool neighborhood market and playground
later around nikki 's first birthday midge was pregnant again with another child who wasn 't named or given a specific gender as the gender was a surprise when the owner opened the doll 's box
midge 's new baby was later named cassandra
midge has two known parents who are simply called grandpa and grandma
at first the grandparent dolls were sold together as part of a big set consisting of the dolls and a kitchen play set but for nikki 's first birthday they were sold separately
midge alan and ryan gave nikki a dog for her birthday
they too came in both caucasian and african american versions
they use different body molds to reflect their age

it is the group 's <num> overall release
clark produced much of insane clown posse 's discography as well as working with other groups on psychopathic records until having a falling @-@ out with icp in <year> after completing icp 's album 's bizaar and bizzar and beginning production on the dark lotus debut album tales from the lotus pod
after becoming a full @-@ time producer for kid rock clark contracted pneumonia but ignored the illness and began coughing severely as he awoke leading to a three @-@ month stay in mount clemens general hospital during which one of his lungs collapsed three times

because of this icp felt that the tempest was missing the collaborative element that they felt made their earlier albums enjoyable
joseph bruce violent j said that the tempest is a concept album in its own right
bruce describes the album 's concept as relating to both a violent storm which turns into a tornado and pulls people into a hurricane as well as a roller coaster
according to bruce that 's a lot like riding on a violent roller coaster i 'd assume
you get jerked to the left jerked to the right sucked way up into the sky and then you go shooting down to the floor and then you jerk up to the left and then you whip around to the right
well the tempest is a storm in the form of a roller coaster
as a result of this concept the album focuses on a variety of different moods
the tempest maintains much of the horrorcore lyrical content icp is known for as well as their humorous perspective
unlike previous albums this album does not contain any disses aimed at other rappers or music industry figures
bruce and joseph utsler shaggy <num> dope s rapping on this album is described by allmusic reviewer david jeffries as being delivered in a carnival barker fashion that fits with their circus motif and contrasted bruce and utsler themselves as being like alice cooper with a mallrat attitude
the lyrics of growing again which describes violent j growing into a giant were inspired by bruce 's weight gain bruce also says that the song reflects the feeling of being able to rap about anything we want
i feel we have the right for some songs to be softer and not about killing or dark carnival
the tower describes a war veteran and expert marksman climbing a college tower and shooting people with an arsenal of weapons a reference to charles whitman 's <year> murder spree

clark 's production incorporates elements of rock and heavy metal as well as live instrumentation
reviewer lana cooper of popmatters compares ride the tempest to flock of seagulls and describes the instrumentation as incorporating elements of synthesizers and calliope
cooper says that growing again incorporates power ballad chords
jeffries describes i do this as being influenced by psychedelia and called mexico city low rider music
the tempest debuted at <num> on the u

the nearest star to earth is the sun
many other stars are visible to the naked eye from earth during the night appearing as a multitude of fixed luminous points in the sky due to their immense distance from earth
historically the most prominent stars were grouped into constellations and asterisms the brightest of which gained proper names
astronomers have assembled star catalogues that identify the known stars and provide standardized stellar designations
however most of the stars in the universe including all stars outside our galaxy the milky way are invisible to the naked eye from earth
indeed most are invisible from earth even through the most powerful telescopes
for at least a portion of its life a star shines due to thermonuclear fusion of hydrogen into helium in its core releasing energy that traverses the star 's interior and then radiates into outer space
almost all naturally occurring elements heavier than helium are created by stellar nucleosynthesis during the star 's lifetime and for some stars by supernova nucleosynthesis when it explodes
near the end of its life a star can also contain degenerate matter
astronomers can determine the mass age metallicity chemical composition and many other properties of a star by observing its motion through space its luminosity and spectrum respectively
the total mass of a star is the main factor that determines its evolution and eventual fate
other characteristics of a star including diameter and temperature change over its life while the star 's environment affects its rotation and movement
a plot of the temperature of many stars against their luminosities produces a plot known as a hertzsprung – russell diagram h – r diagram
plotting a particular star on that diagram allows the age and evolutionary state of that star to be determined
a star 's life begins with the gravitational collapse of a gaseous nebula of material composed primarily of hydrogen along with helium and trace amounts of heavier elements
when the stellar core is sufficiently dense hydrogen becomes steadily converted into helium through nuclear fusion releasing energy in the process
the remainder of the star 's interior carries energy away from the core through a combination of radiative and convective heat transfer processes
the star 's internal pressure prevents it from collapsing further under its own gravity
when the hydrogen fuel at the core is exhausted a star of mass <num>
<num> times greater than the sun 's will expand to become a red giant
in some cases it will fuse heavier elements at the core or in shells around the core
as the star expands it throws a part of its mass enriched with those heavier elements into the interstellar environment to be recycled later as new stars
meanwhile the core becomes a stellar remnant a white dwarf a neutron star or if it is sufficiently massive a black hole
binary and multi @-@ star systems consist of two or more stars that are gravitationally bound and generally move around each other in stable orbits
when two such stars have a relatively close orbit their gravitational interaction can have a significant impact on their evolution
stars can form part of a much larger gravitationally bound structure such as a star cluster or a galaxy
they have been part of religious practices and used for celestial navigation and orientation
many ancient astronomers believed that stars were permanently affixed to a heavenly sphere and that they were immutable
by convention astronomers grouped stars into constellations and used them to track the motions of the planets and the inferred position of the sun
the motion of the sun against the background stars and the horizon was used to create calendars which could be used to regulate agricultural practices
the gregorian calendar currently used nearly everywhere in the world is a solar calendar based on the angle of the earth 's rotational axis relative to its local star the sun
the oldest accurately dated star chart was the result of ancient egyptian astronomy in <year> bc
the earliest known star catalogues were compiled by the ancient babylonian astronomers of mesopotamia in the late <num> millennium bc during the kassite period ca
<year> – <num> bc
the first star catalogue in greek astronomy was created by aristillus in approximately <num> bc with the help of timocharis
the star catalog of hipparchus <num> century bc included <num> stars and was used to assemble ptolemy 's star catalogue
hipparchus is known for the discovery of the first recorded nova new star
many of the constellations and star names in use today derive from greek astronomy
in spite of the apparent immutability of the heavens chinese astronomers were aware that new stars could appear
in <num> ad they were the first to observe and write about a supernova now known as the sn <num>
the brightest stellar event in recorded history was the sn <num> supernova which was observed in <num> and written about by the egyptian astronomer ali ibn ridwan and several chinese astronomers
the sn <num> supernova which gave birth to the crab nebula was also observed by chinese and islamic astronomers
medieval islamic astronomers gave arabic names to many stars that are still used today and they invented numerous astronomical instruments that could compute the positions of the stars
they built the first large observatory research institutes mainly for the purpose of producing zij star catalogues
among these the book of fixed stars <num> was written by the persian astronomer abd al @-@ rahman al @-@ sufi who observed a number of stars star clusters including the omicron velorum and brocchi 's clusters and galaxies including the andromeda galaxy
according to a
zahoor in the <num> century the persian polymath scholar abu rayhan biruni described the milky way galaxy as a multitude of fragments having the properties of nebulous stars and also gave the latitudes of various stars during a lunar eclipse in <num>
according to josep puig the andalusian astronomer ibn bajjah proposed that the milky way was made up of many stars that almost touched one another and appeared to be a continuous image due to the effect of refraction from sublunary material citing his observation of the conjunction of jupiter and mars on <num> ah <num> <num> ad as evidence
early european astronomers such as tycho brahe identified new stars in the night sky later termed novae suggesting that the heavens were not immutable
in <year> giordano bruno suggested that the stars were like the sun and may have other planets possibly even earth @-@ like in orbit around them an idea that had been suggested earlier by the ancient greek philosophers democritus and epicurus and by medieval islamic cosmologists such as fakhr al @-@ din al @-@ razi
by the following century the idea of the stars being the same as the sun was reaching a consensus among astronomers
to explain why these stars exerted no net gravitational pull on the solar system isaac newton suggested that the stars were equally distributed in every direction an idea prompted by the theologian richard bentley
the italian astronomer geminiano montanari recorded observing variations in luminosity of the star algol in <year>
edmond halley published the first measurements of the proper motion of a pair of nearby fixed stars demonstrating that they had changed positions since the time of the ancient greek astronomers ptolemy and hipparchus
william herschel was the first astronomer to attempt to determine the distribution of stars in the sky
during the <num> he established a series of gauges in <num> directions and counted the stars observed along each line of sight
from this he deduced that the number of stars steadily increased toward one side of the sky in the direction of the milky way core
his son john herschel repeated this study in the southern hemisphere and found a corresponding increase in the same direction
in addition to his other accomplishments william herschel is also noted for his discovery that some stars do not merely lie along the same line of sight but are also physical companions that form binary star systems
the science of stellar spectroscopy was pioneered by joseph von fraunhofer and angelo secchi
by comparing the spectra of stars such as sirius to the sun they found differences in the strength and number of their absorption lines — the dark lines in a stellar spectra caused by the atmosphere 's absorption of specific frequencies
in <year> secchi began classifying stars into spectral types
however the modern version of the stellar classification scheme was developed by annie j
cannon during the <num>
the first direct measurement of the distance to a star <num> cygni at <num>
<num> light @-@ years was made in <year> by friedrich bessel using the parallax technique
parallax measurements demonstrated the vast separation of the stars in the heavens
observation of double stars gained increasing importance during the <num> century
in <year> friedrich bessel observed changes in the proper motion of the star sirius and inferred a hidden companion
edward pickering discovered the first spectroscopic binary in <year> when he observed the periodic splitting of the spectral lines of the star mizar in a <num> @-@ day period
detailed observations of many binary star systems were collected by astronomers such as william struve and s
w
burnham allowing the masses of stars to be determined from computation of orbital elements
the first solution to the problem of deriving an orbit of binary stars from telescope observations was made by felix savary in <year>
the twentieth century saw increasingly rapid advances in the scientific study of stars
the photograph became a valuable astronomical tool
karl schwarzschild discovered that the color of a star and hence its temperature could be determined by comparing the visual magnitude against the photographic magnitude
the development of the photoelectric photometer allowed precise measurements of magnitude at multiple wavelength intervals
in <year> albert a
michelson made the first measurements of a stellar diameter using an interferometer on the hooker telescope at mount wilson observatory
important theoretical work on the physical structure of stars occurred during the first decades of the twentieth century
in <year> the hertzsprung @-@ russell diagram was developed propelling the astrophysical study of stars
successful models were developed to explain the interiors of stars and stellar evolution
cecilia payne @-@ gaposchkin first proposed that stars were made primarily of hydrogen and helium in her <year> phd thesis
the spectra of stars were further understood through advances in quantum physics
this allowed the chemical composition of the stellar atmosphere to be determined
with the exception of supernovae individual stars have primarily been observed in the local group and especially in the visible part of the milky way as demonstrated by the detailed star catalogues available for our galaxy
but some stars have been observed in the <num> galaxy of the virgo cluster about <num> million light years from the earth
in the local supercluster it is possible to see star clusters and current telescopes could in principle observe faint individual stars in the local group see cepheids
however outside the local supercluster of galaxies neither individual stars nor clusters of stars have been observed
the only exception is a faint image of a large star cluster containing hundreds of thousands of stars located at a distance of one billion light years — ten times further than the most distant star cluster previously observed
ancient sky watchers imagined that prominent arrangements of stars formed patterns and they associated these with particular aspects of nature or their myths
twelve of these formations lay along the band of the ecliptic and these became the basis of astrology
many of the more prominent individual stars were also given names particularly with arabic or latin designations
as well as certain constellations and the sun itself individual stars have their own myths
to the ancient greeks some stars known as planets greek πλανήτης planētēs meaning wanderer represented various important deities from which the names of the planets mercury venus mars jupiter and saturn were taken
uranus and neptune were also greek and roman gods but neither planet was known in antiquity because of their low brightness
their names were assigned by later astronomers
circa <year> the names of the constellations were used to name the stars in the corresponding regions of the sky
the german astronomer johann bayer created a series of star maps and applied greek letters as designations to the stars in each constellation
later a numbering system based on the star 's right ascension was invented and added to john flamsteed 's star catalogue in his book historia coelestis britannica the <year> edition whereby this numbering system came to be called flamsteed designation or flamsteed numbering
the only internationally recognized authority for naming celestial bodies is the international astronomical union iau
a number of private companies sell names of stars which the british library calls an unregulated commercial enterprise
the iau has disassociated itself from this commercial practice and these names are neither recognized by the iau nor used by them
one such star @-@ naming company is the international star registry which during the <num> was accused of deceptive practice for making it appear that the assigned name was official
this now @-@ discontinued isr practice was informally labeled a scam and a fraud and the new york city department of consumer affairs issued a violation against isr for engaging in a deceptive trade practice
these regions known as molecular clouds consist mostly of hydrogen with about <num> to <num> percent helium and a few percent heavier elements
one example of such a star @-@ forming region is the orion nebula
most stars form in groups of dozens to hundreds of thousands of stars
massive stars in these groups may powerfully illuminate those clouds ionizing the hydrogen and creating h ii regions
such feedback effects from star formation may ultimately disrupt the cloud and prevent further star formation
all stars spend the majority of their existence as main sequence stars fueled primarily by the nuclear fusion of hydrogen into helium within their cores
however stars of different masses have markedly different properties at various stages of their development
the ultimate fate of more massive stars differs from that of less massive stars as do their luminosities and the impact they have on their environment
accordingly astronomers often group stars by their mass very low mass stars with masses below <num>
<num> m ☉ are fully convective and distribute helium evenly throughout the whole star while on the main sequence
therefore they never undergo shell burning never become red giants which cease fusing and become helium white dwarfs and slowly cool after exhausting their hydrogen
however as the lifetime of <num>
<num> m ☉ stars is longer than the age of the universe no such star has yet reached the white dwarf stage
low mass stars including the sun with a mass between <num>
<num> m ☉ and <num>
<num> – <num>
<num> m ☉ depending on composition do become red giants as their core hydrogen is depleted and they begin to burn helium in core in a helium flash they develop a degenerate carbon @-@ oxygen core later on the asymptotic giant branch they finally blow off their outer shell as a planetary nebula and leave behind their core in the form of a white dwarf
intermediate @-@ mass stars between <num>
<num> – <num>
<num> m ☉ and <num> – <num> m ☉ pass through evolutionary stages similar to low mass stars but after a relatively short period on the rgb they ignite helium without a flash and spend an extended period in the red clump before forming a degenerate carbon @-@ oxygen core
massive stars generally have a minimum mass of <num> – <num> m ☉ possibly as low as <num> – <num> m ☉
after exhausting the hydrogen at the core these stars become supergiants and go on to fuse elements heavier than helium
they end their lives when their cores collapse and they explode as supernovae
when a region reaches a sufficient density of matter to satisfy the criteria for jeans instability it begins to collapse under its own gravitational force
as the cloud collapses individual conglomerations of dense dust and gas form bok globules
as a globule collapses and the density increases the gravitational energy converts into heat and the temperature rises
when the protostellar cloud has approximately reached the stable condition of hydrostatic equilibrium a protostar forms at the core
these pre – main sequence stars are often surrounded by a protoplanetary disk and powered mainly by the conversion of gravitational energy
the period of gravitational contraction lasts about <num> to <num> million years
early stars of less than <num> m ☉ are called t tauri stars while those with greater mass are herbig ae be stars
these newly formed stars emit jets of gas along their axis of rotation which may reduce the angular momentum of the collapsing star and result in small patches of nebulosity known as herbig – haro objects
these jets in combination with radiation from nearby massive stars may help to drive away the surrounding cloud from which the star was formed
early in their development t tauri stars follow the hayashi track — they contract and decrease in luminosity while remaining at roughly the same temperature
less massive t tauri stars follow this track to the main sequence while more massive stars turn onto the henyey track
most stars are observed to be members of binary star systems and the properties of those binaries are the result of the conditions in which they formed
a gas cloud must lose its angular momentum in order to collapse and form a star
the fragmentation of the cloud into multiple stars distributes some of that angular momentum
the primordial binaries transfer some angular momentum by gravitational interactions during close encounters with other stars in young stellar clusters
these interactions tend to split apart more widely separated soft binaries while causing hard binaries to become more tightly bound
this produces the separation of binaries into their two observed populations distributions
such stars are said to be on the main sequence and are called dwarf stars
starting at zero @-@ age main sequence the proportion of helium in a star 's core will steadily increase the rate of nuclear fusion at the core will slowly increase as will the star 's temperature and luminosity
the sun for example is estimated to have increased in luminosity by about <num> since it reached the main sequence <num>
<num> billion <num>
<num> × <num> years ago
every star generates a stellar wind of particles that causes a continual outflow of gas into space
for most stars the mass lost is negligible
the sun loses <num> − <num> m ☉ every year or about <num>
<num> of its total mass over its entire lifespan
however very massive stars can lose <num> − <num> to <num> − <num> m ☉ each year significantly affecting their evolution
stars that begin with more than <num> m ☉ can lose over half their total mass while on the main sequence
the time a star spends on the main sequence depends primarily on the amount of fuel it has and the rate at which it fuses it
the sun 's is expected to live <num> billion <num> years
massive stars consume their fuel very rapidly and are short @-@ lived
low mass stars consume their fuel very slowly
stars less massive than <num>
<num> m ☉ called red dwarfs are able to fuse nearly all of their mass while stars of about <num> m ☉ can only fuse about <num> of their mass
the combination of their slow fuel @-@ consumption and relatively large usable fuel supply allows low mass stars to last about one trillion <num> years the most extreme of <num>
<num> m ☉ will last for about <num> trillion years
red dwarfs become hotter and more luminous as they accumulate helium
when they eventually run out of hydrogen they contract into a white dwarf and decline in temperature
however since the lifespan of such stars is greater than the current age of the universe <num>
<num> billion years no stars under about <num>
<num> m ☉ are expected to have moved off the main sequence
besides mass the elements heavier than helium can play a significant role in the evolution of stars
astronomers label all elements heavier than helium metals and call the chemical concentration of these elements in a star its metallicity
a star 's metallicity can influence the time the star takes to burn its fuel and controls the formation of its magnetic fields which affects the strength of its stellar wind
older population ii stars have substantially less metallicity than the younger population i stars due to the composition of the molecular clouds from which they formed
over time such clouds become increasingly enriched in heavier elements as older stars die and shed portions of their atmospheres
<num> m ☉ exhaust their supply of hydrogen at their core they start to fuse hydrogen in a shell outside the helium core
their outer layers expand and cool greatly as they form a red giant
in about <num> billion years when the sun enters the helium burning phase it will expand to a maximum radius of roughly <num> astronomical unit <num> million kilometres <num> times its present size and lose <num> of its current mass
as the hydrogen shell burning produces more helium the core increases in mass and temperature
in a red giant of up to <num>
<num> m ☉ the mass of the helium core becomes degenerate prior to helium fusion
finally when the temperature increases sufficiently helium fusion begins explosively in what is called a helium flash and the star rapidly shrinks in radius increases its surface temperature and moves to the horizontal branch of the hr diagram
for more massive stars helium core fusion starts before the core becomes degenerate and the star spends some time in the red clump slowly burning helium before the outer convective envelope collapses and the star then moves to the horizontal branch
after the star has fused the helium of its core the carbon product fuses producing a hot core with an outer shell of fusing helium
the star then follows an evolutionary path called the asymptotic giant branch agb that parallels the other described red giant phase but with a higher luminosity
the more massive agb stars may undergo a brief period of carbon fusion before the core becomes degenerate
when this fuel is exhausted at the core they continue to fuse elements heavier than helium
the core contracts and the temperature and pressure rises enough to fuse carbon see carbon burning process
this process continues with the successive stages being fueled by neon see neon burning process oxygen see oxygen burning process and silicon see silicon burning process
near the end of the star 's life fusion continues along a series of onion @-@ layer shells within a massive star
each shell fuses a different element with the outermost shell fusing hydrogen the next shell fusing helium and so forth
the final stage occurs when a massive star begins producing iron
since iron nuclei are more tightly bound than any heavier nuclei any fusion beyond iron does not produce a net release of energy
to a very limited degree such a process proceeds but it consumes energy
likewise since they are more tightly bound than all lighter nuclei such energy cannot be released by fission
in relatively old very massive stars a large core of inert iron will accumulate in the center of the star
the heavier elements in these stars can work their way to the surface forming evolved objects known as wolf @-@ rayet stars that have a dense stellar wind which sheds the outer atmosphere
if what remains after the outer atmosphere has been shed is less than <num>
<num> m ☉ it shrinks to a relatively tiny object about the size of earth known as a white dwarf
white dwarfs lack the mass for further gravitational compression to take place
the electron @-@ degenerate matter inside a white dwarf is no longer a plasma even though stars are generally referred to as being spheres of plasma
eventually white dwarfs fade into black dwarfs over a very long period of time
in larger stars fusion continues until the iron core has grown so large more than <num>
<num> m ☉ that it can no longer support its own mass
this core will suddenly collapse as its electrons are driven into its protons forming neutrons neutrinos and gamma rays in a burst of electron capture and inverse beta decay
the shockwave formed by this sudden collapse causes the rest of the star to explode in a supernova
supernovae become so bright that they may briefly outshine the star 's entire home galaxy
when they occur within the milky way supernovae have historically been observed by naked @-@ eye observers as new stars where none seemingly existed before
a supernova explosion blows away the star 's outer layers leaving a remnant such as the crab nebula
the core is compressed into a neutron star which sometimes manifests itself as a pulsar or x @-@ ray burster
in the case of the largest stars the remnant is a black hole greater than <num> m ☉ s
in a neutron star the matter is in a state known as neutron @-@ degenerate matter with a more exotic form of degenerate matter qcd matter possibly present in the core
within a black hole the matter is in a state that is not currently understood
the blown @-@ off outer layers of dying stars include heavy elements which may be recycled during the formation of new stars
these heavy elements allow the formation of rocky planets
the outflow from supernovae and the stellar wind of large stars play an important part in shaping the interstellar medium
if stars in a binary system are sufficiently close when one of the stars expands to become a red giant it may overflow its roche lobe the region around a star where material is gravitationally bound to that star leading to transfer of material to the other
when the roche lobe is violated a variety of phenomena can result including contact binaries common @-@ envelope binaries cataclysmic variables and type ia supernovae
the simplest and most common multi @-@ star system is a binary star but systems of three or more stars are also found
for reasons of orbital stability such multi @-@ star systems are often organized into hierarchical sets of binary stars
larger groups called star clusters also exist
these range from loose stellar associations with only a few stars up to enormous globular clusters with hundreds of thousands of stars
such systems orbit our milky way galaxy
it has been a long @-@ held assumption that the majority of stars occur in gravitationally bound multiple @-@ star systems
this is particularly true for very massive o and b class stars where <num> of the stars are believed to be part of multiple @-@ star systems
the proportion of single star systems increases with decreasing star mass so that only <num> of red dwarfs are known to have stellar companions
as <num> of all stars are red dwarfs most stars in the milky way are likely single from birth
stars are not spread uniformly across the universe but are normally grouped into galaxies along with interstellar gas and dust
a typical galaxy contains hundreds of billions of stars and there are more than <num> billion <num> galaxies in the observable universe
in <year> one estimate of the number of stars in the observable universe was <num> sextillion <num> × <num>
while it is often believed that stars only exist within galaxies intergalactic stars have been discovered
the nearest star to the earth apart from the sun is proxima centauri which is <num>
<num> trillion kilometres or <num>
<num> light @-@ years
travelling at the orbital speed of the space shuttle <num> kilometres per second — almost <num> @,@ <num> kilometres per hour it would take about <num> @,@ <num> years to arrive
this it typical of stellar separations in galactic discs
stars can be much closer to each other in the centres of galaxies and in globular clusters or much farther apart in galactic halos
due to the relatively vast distances between stars outside the galactic nucleus collisions between stars are thought to be rare
in denser regions such as the core of globular clusters or the galactic center collisions can be more common
such collisions can produce what are known as blue stragglers
these abnormal stars have a higher surface temperature than the other main sequence stars with the same luminosity of the cluster to which it belongs
some stars may even be close to <num>
<num> billion years old — the observed age of the universe
the oldest star yet discovered hd <num> nicknamed methuselah star is an estimated <num>
<num> ± <num>
<num> billion years old
due to the uncertainty in the value this age for the star does not conflict with the age of the universe determined by the planck satellite as <num>
<num> ± <num>
<num>
the more massive the star the shorter its lifespan primarily because massive stars have greater pressure on their cores causing them to burn hydrogen more rapidly
the most massive stars last an average of a few million years while stars of minimum mass red dwarfs burn their fuel very slowly and can last tens to hundreds of billions of years
typically the portion of heavy elements is measured in terms of the iron content of the stellar atmosphere as iron is a common element and its absorption lines are relatively easy to measure
the portion of heavier elements may be an indicator of the likelihood that the star has a planetary system
the star with the lowest iron content ever measured is the dwarf he1327 @-@ <num> with only <num> <num> the iron content of the sun
by contrast the super @-@ metal @-@ rich star μ leonis has nearly double the abundance of iron as the sun while the planet @-@ bearing star <num> herculis has nearly triple the iron
there also exist chemically peculiar stars that show unusual abundances of certain elements in their spectrum especially chromium and rare earth elements
stars with cooler outer atmospheres including the sun can form various diatomic and polyatomic molecules
the sun is also a star but it is close enough to the earth to appear as a disk instead and to provide daylight
other than the sun the star with the largest apparent size is r doradus with an angular diameter of only <num>
<num> arcseconds
the disks of most stars are much too small in angular size to be observed with current ground @-@ based optical telescopes and so interferometer telescopes are required to produce images of these objects
another technique for measuring the angular size of stars is through occultation
by precisely measuring the drop in brightness of a star as it is occulted by the moon or the rise in brightness when it reappears the star 's angular diameter can be computed
stars range in size from neutron stars which vary anywhere from <num> to <num> km <num> mi in diameter to supergiants like betelgeuse in the orion constellation which has a diameter approximately <num> @,@ <num> times that of the sun — about <num> @,@ <num> @,@ <num> @,@ <num> km <num> @,@ <num> @,@ <num> mi
betelgeuse however has a much lower density than the sun
the components of motion of a star consist of the radial velocity toward or away from the sun and the traverse angular movement which is called its proper motion
radial velocity is measured by the doppler shift of the star 's spectral lines and is given in units of km s
the proper motion of a star its parallax is determined by precise astrometric measurements in units of milli @-@ arc seconds mas per year
with knowledge of the star 's parallax and its distance the proper motion velocity can be calculated
together with the radial velocity the total velocity can be calculated
stars with high rates of proper motion are likely to be relatively close to the sun making them good candidates for parallax measurements
when both rates of movement are known the space velocity of the star relative to the sun or the galaxy can be computed
among nearby stars it has been found that younger population i stars have generally lower velocities than older population ii stars
the latter have elliptical orbits that are inclined to the plane of the galaxy
a comparison of the kinematics of nearby stars has allowed astronomers to trace their origin to common points in giant molecular clouds and are referred to as stellar associations
this movement of conductive plasma functions like a dynamo wherein the movement of elecrical charges induce magnetic fields as does a mechanical dynamo
those magnetic fields have a great range that extend throughout and beyond the star
the strength of the magnetic field varies with the mass and composition of the star and the amount of magnetic surface activity depends upon the star 's rate of rotation
this surface activity produces starspots which are regions of strong magnetic fields and lower than normal surface temperatures
coronal loops are arching magnetic field flux lines that rise from a star 's surface into the star 's outer atmosphere its corona
the coronal loops can be seen due to the plasma they conduct along their length
stellar flares are bursts of high @-@ energy particles that are emitted due to the same magnetic activity
young rapidly rotating stars tend to have high levels of surface activity because of their magnetic field
the magnetic field can act upon a star 's stellar wind functioning as a brake to gradually slow the rate of rotation with time
thus older stars such as the sun have a much slower rate of rotation and a lower level of surface activity
the activity levels of slowly rotating stars tend to vary in a cyclical manner and can shut down altogether for periods of time
during the maunder minimum for example the sun underwent a <num> @-@ year period with almost no sunspot activity
studies of the most massive open clusters suggests <num> m ☉ as an upper limit for stars in the current era of the universe
this represents an empirical value for the theoretical limit on the mass of forming stars due to increasing radiation pressure on the accreting gas cloud
several stars in the r136 cluster in the large magellanic cloud have been measured with larger masses but it has been determined that they could have been created through the collision and merger of massive stars in close binary systems sidestepping the <num> m ☉ limit on massive star formation
the first stars to form after the big bang may have been larger up to <num> m ☉ due to the complete absence of elements heavier than lithium in their composition
this generation of supermassive population iii stars is likely to have existed in the very early universe i
e
they are observed to have a high redshift and may have started the production of chemical elements heavier than hydrogen that are needed for the later formation of planets and life
in june <year> astronomers reported evidence for population iii stars in the cosmos redshift <num> galaxy at z <num>
<num>
with a mass only <num> times that of jupiter mj 2mass j0523 @-@ <year> is the smallest known star undergoing nuclear fusion in its core
for stars with metallicity similar to the sun the theoretical minimum mass the star can have and still undergo fusion at the core is estimated to be about <num> mj
when the metallicity is very low however the minimum star size seems to be about <num>
<num> of the solar mass or about <num> mj
smaller bodies called brown dwarfs occupy a poorly defined grey area between stars and gas giants
the combination of the radius and the mass of a star determines its surface gravity
giant stars have a much lower surface gravity than do main sequence stars while the opposite is the case for degenerate compact stars such as white dwarfs
the surface gravity can influence the appearance of a star 's spectrum with higher gravity causing a broadening of the absorption lines
young stars can have a rotation greater than <num> km s at the equator
the b @-@ class star achernar for example has an equatorial velocity of about <num> km s or greater causing its equator to be slung outward and giving it an equatorial diameter that is more than <num> greater than between the poles
this rate of rotation is just below the critical velocity of <num> km s at which speed the star would break apart
by contrast the sun rotates once every <num> – <num> days with an equatorial velocity of <num>
<num> km s
a main sequence star 's magnetic field and the stellar wind serve to slow its rotation by a significant amount as it evolves on the main sequence
degenerate stars have contracted into a compact mass resulting in a rapid rate of rotation
however they have relatively low rates of rotation compared to what would be expected by conservation of angular momentum — the tendency of a rotating body to compensate for a contraction in size by increasing its rate of spin
a large portion of the star 's angular momentum is dissipated as a result of mass loss through the stellar wind
in spite of this the rate of rotation for a pulsar can be very rapid
the pulsar at the heart of the crab nebula for example rotates <num> times per second
the rotation rate of the pulsar will gradually slow due to the emission of radiation
the temperature is normally given in terms of an effective temperature which is the temperature of an idealized black body that radiates its energy at the same luminosity per surface area as the star
note that the effective temperature is only a representative of the surface as the temperature increases toward the core
the temperature in the core region of a star is several million kelvins
the stellar temperature will determine the rate of ionization of various elements resulting in characteristic absorption lines in the spectrum
the surface temperature of a star along with its visual absolute magnitude and absorption features is used to classify a star see classification below
massive main sequence stars can have surface temperatures of <num> @,@ <num> k
smaller stars such as the sun have surface temperatures of a few thousand k
red giants have relatively low surface temperatures of about <num> @,@ <num> k but they also have a high luminosity due to their large exterior surface area
the particle radiation emitted by a star is manifested as the stellar wind which streams from the outer layers as electrically charged protons and alpha and beta particles
although almost massless there also exists a steady stream of neutrinos emanating from the star 's core
the production of energy at the core is the reason stars shine so brightly every time two or more atomic nuclei fuse together to form a single atomic nucleus of a new heavier element gamma ray photons are released from the nuclear fusion product
this energy is converted to other forms of electromagnetic energy of lower frequency such as visible light by the time it reaches the star 's outer layers
the color of a star as determined by the most intense frequency of the visible light depends on the temperature of the star 's outer layers including its photosphere
besides visible light stars also emit forms of electromagnetic radiation that are invisible to the human eye
in fact stellar electromagnetic radiation spans the entire electromagnetic spectrum from the longest wavelengths of radio waves through infrared visible light ultraviolet to the shortest of x @-@ rays and gamma rays
from the standpoint of total energy emitted by a star not all components of stellar electromagnetic radiation are significant but all frequencies provide insight into the star 's physics
using the stellar spectrum astronomers can also determine the surface temperature surface gravity metallicity and rotational velocity of a star
if the distance of the star is found such as by measuring the parallax then the luminosity of the star can be derived
the mass radius surface gravity and rotation period can then be estimated based on stellar models
mass can be calculated for stars in binary systems by measuring their orbital velocities and distances
gravitational microlensing has been used to measure the mass of a single star
with these parameters astronomers can also estimate the age of the star
it has units of power
the luminosity of a star is determined by its radius and surface temperature
many stars do not radiate uniformly across their entire surface
the rapidly rotating star vega for example has a higher energy flux power per unit area at its poles than along its equator
patches of the star 's surface with a lower temperature and luminosity than average are known as starspots
small dwarf stars such as our sun generally have essentially featureless disks with only small starspots
giant stars have much larger more obvious starspots and they also exhibit strong stellar limb darkening
that is the brightness decreases towards the edge of the stellar disk
red dwarf flare stars such as uv ceti may also possess prominent starspot features
it is a function of the star 's luminosity its distance from earth and the altering of the star 's light as it passes through earth 's atmosphere
intrinsic or absolute magnitude is directly related to a star 's luminosity and is what the apparent magnitude a star would be if the distance between the earth and the star were <num> parsecs <num>
<num> light @-@ years
both the apparent and absolute magnitude scales are logarithmic units one whole number difference in magnitude is equal to a brightness variation of about <num>
<num> times the <num> root of <num> or approximately <num>
<num>
this means that a first magnitude star <num>
<num> is about <num>
<num> times brighter than a second magnitude <num>
<num> star and about <num> times brighter than a sixth magnitude star <num>
<num>
the faintest stars visible to the naked eye under good seeing conditions are about magnitude <num>
on both apparent and absolute magnitude scales the smaller the magnitude number the brighter the star the larger the magnitude number the fainter the star
the brightest stars on either scale have negative magnitude numbers
the variation in brightness δl between two stars is calculated by subtracting the magnitude number of the brighter star mb from the magnitude number of the fainter star mf then using the difference as an exponent for the base number <num>
<num> that is to say <formula> <formula> relative to both luminosity and distance from earth a star 's absolute magnitude m and apparent magnitude m are not equivalent for example the bright star sirius has an apparent magnitude of − <num>
<num> but it has an absolute magnitude of <num>
<num>
the sun has an apparent magnitude of − <num>
<num> but its absolute magnitude is only <num>
<num>
sirius the brightest star in the night sky as seen from earth is approximately <num> times more luminous than the sun while canopus the second brightest star in the night sky with an absolute magnitude of − <num>
<num> is approximately <num> @,@ <num> times more luminous than the sun
despite canopus being vastly more luminous than sirius however sirius appears brighter than canopus
this is because sirius is merely <num>
<num> light @-@ years from the earth while canopus is much farther away at a distance of <num> light @-@ years
as of <year> the star with the highest known absolute magnitude is lbv <year> @-@ <num> with a magnitude of − <num>
<num>
this star is at least <num> @,@ <num> @,@ <num> times more luminous than the sun
the least luminous stars that are currently known are located in the ngc <num> cluster
the faintest red dwarfs in the cluster were magnitude <num> while a <num> magnitude white dwarf was also discovered
these faint stars are so dim that their light is as bright as a birthday candle on the moon when viewed from the earth
it thought that the hydrogen line strength was a simple linear function of temperature
rather it was more complicated it strengthened with increasing temperature it peaked near <num> k and then declined at greater temperatures
when the classifications were reordered by temperature it more closely resembled the modern scheme
stars are given a single @-@ letter classification according to their spectra ranging from type o which are very hot to m which are so cool that molecules may form in their atmospheres
the main classifications in order of decreasing surface temperature are o b a f g k and m
a variety of rare spectral types are given special classifications
the most common of these are types l and t which classify the coldest low @-@ mass stars and brown dwarfs
each letter has <num> sub @-@ divisions numbered from <num> to <num> in order of decreasing temperature
however this system breaks down at extreme high temperatures as classes o0 and o1 may not exist
in addition stars may be classified by the luminosity effects found in their spectral lines which correspond to their spatial size and is determined by their surface gravity
these range from <num> hypergiants through iii giants to v main sequence dwarfs some authors add vii white dwarfs
most stars belong to the main sequence which consists of ordinary hydrogen @-@ burning stars
these fall along a narrow diagonal band when graphed according to their absolute magnitude and spectral type
the sun is a main sequence g2v yellow dwarf of intermediate temperature and ordinary size
additional nomenclature in the form of lower @-@ case letters added to the end of the spectral type to indicate peculiar features of the spectrum
for example an e can indicate the presence of emission lines m represents unusually strong levels of metals and var can mean variations in the spectral type
white dwarf stars have their own class that begins with the letter d
this is further sub @-@ divided into the classes da db dc do dz and dq depending on the types of prominent lines found in the spectrum
this is followed by a numerical value that indicates the temperature
of the intrinsically variable stars the primary types can be subdivided into three principal groups
during their stellar evolution some stars pass through phases where they can become pulsating variables
pulsating variable stars vary in radius and luminosity over time expanding and contracting with periods ranging from minutes to years depending on the size of the star
this category includes cepheid and cepheid @-@ like stars and long @-@ period variables such as mira
eruptive variables are stars that experience sudden increases in luminosity because of flares or mass ejection events
this group includes protostars wolf @-@ rayet stars and flare stars as well as giant and supergiant stars
cataclysmic or explosive variable stars are those that undergo a dramatic change in their properties
this group includes novae and supernovae
a binary star system that includes a nearby white dwarf can produce certain types of these spectacular stellar explosions including the nova and a type 1a supernova
the explosion is created when the white dwarf accretes hydrogen from the companion star building up mass until the hydrogen undergoes fusion
some novae are also recurrent having periodic outbursts of moderate amplitude
stars can also vary in luminosity because of extrinsic factors such as eclipsing binaries as well as rotating stars that produce extreme starspots
a notable example of an eclipsing binary is algol which regularly varies in magnitude from <num>
<num> to <num>
<num> over a period of <num>
<num> days
the balanced forces are inward gravitational force and an outward force due to the pressure gradient within the star
the pressure gradient is established by the temperature gradient of the plasma the outer part of the star is cooler than the core
the temperature at the core of a main sequence or giant star is at least on the order of <num> k
the resulting temperature and pressure at the hydrogen @-@ burning core of a main sequence star are sufficient for nuclear fusion to occur and for sufficient energy to be produced to prevent further collapse of the star
as atomic nuclei are fused in the core they emit energy in the form of gamma rays
these photons interact with the surrounding plasma adding to the thermal energy at the core
stars on the main sequence convert hydrogen into helium creating a slowly but steadily increasing proportion of helium in the core
eventually the helium content becomes predominant and energy production ceases at the core
instead for stars of more than <num>
<num> m ☉ fusion occurs in a slowly expanding shell around the degenerate helium core
in addition to hydrostatic equilibrium the interior of a stable star will also maintain an energy balance of thermal equilibrium
there is a radial temperature gradient throughout the interior that results in a flux of energy flowing toward the exterior
the outgoing flux of energy leaving any layer within the star will exactly match the incoming flux from below
the radiation zone is the region of the stellar interior where the flux of energy outward is dependent on radiative heat transfer since convective heat transfer is inefficient in that zone
in this region the plasma will not be perturbed and any mass motions will die out
if this is not the case however then the plasma becomes unstable and convection will occur forming a convection zone
this can occur for example in regions where very high energy fluxes occur such as near the core or in areas with high opacity making radiatative heat transfer inefficient as in the outer envelope
the occurrence of convection in the outer envelope of a main sequence star depends on the star 's mass
stars with several times the mass of the sun have a convection zone deep within the interior and a radiative zone in the outer layers
smaller stars such as the sun are just the opposite with the convective zone located in the outer layers
red dwarf stars with less than <num>
<num> m ☉ are convective throughout which prevents the accumulation of a helium core
for most stars the convective zones will also vary over time as the star ages and the constitution of the interior is modified
the photosphere is that portion of a star that is visible to an observer
this is the layer at which the plasma of the star becomes transparent to photons of light
from here the energy generated at the core becomes free to propagate into space
it is within the photosphere that sun spots regions of lower than average temperature appear
above the level of the photosphere is the stellar atmosphere
in a main sequence star such as the sun the lowest level of the atmosphere just above the photosphere is the thin chromosphere region where spicules appear and stellar flares begin
above this is the transition region where the temperature rapidly increases within a distance of only <num> km <num> mi
beyond this is the corona a volume of super @-@ heated plasma that can extend outward to several million kilometres
the existence of a corona appears to be dependent on a convective zone in the outer layers of the star
despite its high temperature and the corona emits very little light due to its low gas density
the corona region of the sun is normally only visible during a solar eclipse
from the corona a stellar wind of plasma particles expands outward from the star until it interacts with the interstellar medium
for the sun the influence of its solar wind extends throughout a bubble @-@ shaped region called the heliosphere
when nuclei fuse the mass of the fused product is less than the mass of the original parts
this lost mass is converted to electromagnetic energy according to the mass @-@ energy equivalence relationship e mc2
the hydrogen fusion process is temperature @-@ sensitive so a moderate increase in the core temperature will result in a significant increase in the fusion rate
as a result the core temperature of main sequence stars only varies from <num> million kelvin for a small m @-@ class star to <num> million kelvin for a massive o @-@ class star
in the sun with a <num> @-@ million @-@ kelvin core hydrogen fuses to form helium in the proton @-@ proton chain reaction 41h → 22h 2e 2νe <num> x <num>
<num> mev 2e 2e- → 2γ <num> x <num>
<num> mev 21h 22h → 23he 2γ <num> x <num>
<num> mev 23he → 4he 21h <num>
<num> mev these reactions result in the overall reaction 41h → 4he 2e 2γ 2νe <num>
<num> mev where e is a positron γ is a gamma ray photon νe is a neutrino and h and he are isotopes of hydrogen and helium respectively
the energy released by this reaction is in millions of electron volts which is actually only a tiny amount of energy
however enormous numbers of these reactions occur constantly producing all the energy necessary to sustain the star 's radiation output
in comparison the combustion of two hydrogen gas molecules with one oxygen gas molecule releases only <num>
<num> ev
in more massive stars helium is produced in a cycle of reactions catalyzed by carbon called the carbon @-@ nitrogen @-@ oxygen cycle
in evolved stars with cores at <num> million kelvin and masses between <num>
<num> and <num> m ☉ helium can be transformed into carbon in the triple @-@ alpha process that uses the intermediate element beryllium 4he 4he <num> kev → <num> be 4he <num> be <num> kev → <num> c <num> c → 12c γ <num>
<num> mev for an overall reaction of 34he → 12c γ <num>
<num> mev in massive stars heavier elements can also be burned in a contracting core through the neon burning process and oxygen burning process
the final stage in the stellar nucleosynthesis process is the silicon burning process that results in the production of the stable isotope iron @-@ <num> an endothermic process that consumes energy and so further energy can only be produced through gravitational collapse
the example below shows the amount of time required for a star of <num> m ☉ to consume all of its nuclear fuel
as an o @-@ class main sequence star it would be <num> times the solar radius and <num> @,@ <num> times the sun 's luminosity
perry was created by the series co @-@ founders dan povenmire and jeff swampy marsh
he first appeared along with the majority of the main cast in the pilot episode rollercoaster
perry is featured as the star of the b @-@ plot for every episode of the series alongside his nemesis dr
heinz doofenshmirtz
a mostly silent character his lone vocal characteristic a rattling of perry 's beak was provided by dee bradley baker
perry is the pet platypus of the flynn @-@ fletcher family and is perceived as mindless and domesticated
in secret however he lives a double life as a member of an all @-@ animal espionage organization referred to as o
w
c
a
the organization without a cool acronym
many secret entrances to his underground lair exist all around the house such as the side of the house most notably the tree that his owners sit under in the backyard and several other everyday objects that seem to elude the family 's attention
he engages in daily battles with dr
heinz doofenshmirtz an evil scientist who desires to take over the tri @-@ state area with obscure contraptions that work perfectly according to his intended function but fail in his application of them every time
perry was made a platypus because of the animal 's striking appearance and the lack of public knowledge of the animal which allowed the writers to make things up about the species
critical reception for the character from both professionals and fans have been considerably positive
merchandising of the character include plush toys t @-@ shirts wooden toys glasses and coloring books along with appearances in literature and a <year> video game for the nintendo ds
unbeknownst to them perry lives a double life as a crime @-@ fighting spy working for the organization without a cool acronym the owca going by the codename agent p
he reports to his superior major monogram via telecast in his large high @-@ tech underground hideout
every day he engages in battles with the evil scientist dr
heinz doofenshmirtz who tries using inventions to take over the tri @-@ state area
perry is always able to foil doofenshmirtz 's plans and in doing so accidentally leads to the destruction of whatever form of contraption his owners phineas flynn and ferb fletcher are building in order to make summer better
phineas and ferb are aware that something happens to get rid of their scheme for the day but do not know that perry is the cause behind it and are largely dismissive of it
their sister candace also does not know that perry is behind the destruction and is driven to near insanity trying to figure it out
throughout the series perry is aware of phineas and ferb 's inventions but is largely uninterested in them save whenever he notices that their latest invention may help him thwart doofenshmirtz
perry and doofenshmirtz at first seem to loathe each other in the beginning of the series and have been arch @-@ nemeses since the day they met
however they are often cordial and friendly towards one another and it is said by doofenshmirtz that perry is his best friend and perry will often act to save doofenshmirtz 's life when his plot inevitably blows up in his face
habitually their daily brawls involve doofenshmirtz devising a scheme which perry goes to stop after being briefed by major monogram
he is trapped by doofenshmirtz while trying to do so and is told of the doctor 's scheme usually pertaining to some backstory or pet peeve
he then escapes and the two fight perry coming out victorious
the two rely on this daily structure doofenshmirtz even specifically mentioning it in journey to the center of candace and in episodes such as it 's about time in which doofenshmirtz temporarily replaces perry with secret agent peter the panda and they become depressed about not having each other to fight
perry realizes he misses doof too
when perry does not arrive on the scene of doofenshmirtz 's evil plan the doctor hesitates to execute his plans and fears for where perry has gone though he notes that he hopes something terrible has happened to him

sometimes they decided not to fight and have fun as shown in happy new year and candace disconnected
on other occasions depending on whatever situation doofenshmirtz is facing perry would often help doofenshmirtz with his non @-@ evil plans such as helping him overcome evil scientist 's block helping him put on a birthday party for his <num> @-@ year @-@ old daughter vanessa impressing a square dancing girl with programmable square dancing boots that doofenshmritz created working together to stop a raging platypus hunter from hunting them down or helping him convince his rich ex @-@ wife to help pay off his mortgage debt
also perry tends to use doofenshmirtz 's inventions to erase evidence of whatever contraptions phineas and ferb had made leaving candace unable to bust them
examples include when perry asked to borrow doofenshmirtz 's robot norm to pick up footage from the city surveillance cameras in order to preserve his job as an agent as well as using doofenshmirtz 's pick @-@ him @-@ up @-@ inator to rescue a lost candace and bring her home
in phineas and ferb the movie across the <num> dimension an alternate reality yet more evil and ruthless version of perry known as platyborg appears as the secondary antagonist with the regular perry serving as a supporting protagonist
platyborg would later return in the episode sequel tales from the resistance back to the <num> dimension this time as a supporting protagonist
among these were actions sequences and chase scenes
povenmire and marsh wanted to reuse these elements in their series and chose perry to execute it
the pair gave him a consistent and continuous nemesis in the form of doofenshmirtz as a means of allowing viewers to get to know him
while choosing a species for perry povenmire and marsh wanted to keep in mind selecting one that was uncommon an animal that kids could not pick out at a pet store and beg their parents for
they chose a platypus because of the animal 's obscure and striking appearance
the animal was scarcely used in american animated programs so the pair opined that perry would not have to compete with preconceived notions that viewers might bring to a more conventional critter
the blank storyboard they were given allowed them to make stuff up since no one knows very much about them
perry has a theme song tentatively entitled perry performed by randy crenshaw and laura dickinson and written by povenmire and marsh who write the majority of songs in the series
the song along with the number gitchee gitchee goo from the episode flop starz was the first musical composition povenmire and marsh pitched to the walt disney company
they were nervous doing so because as povenmire explained disney has a big history of music -- what if they hate it their reaction however was considerably positive and the pair was asked to write a song for each episode which they vehemently agreed to
the opening lyrics for the song describe perry as a standard textbook definition of a platypus he 's a semi @-@ aquatic egg @-@ laying mammal of action
in keeping with the show 's general design scheme perry is constructed of geometric shapes in a style reminiscent of deceased looney tunes animator tex avery
povenmire uses different design styles for drawing perry depending on how he is portrayed
when perry is portrayed as a domesticated and mindless pet povenmire begins with a square shaped like a loaf of bread
he then draws his front legs and feet before drawing his bill which is set at a certain angle
povenmire then draws his eyeballs which are never focused and look in opposing directions in a daze
he concludes the figure by adding his hind legs tail hair and finally color
when portrayed as a secret agent povenmire starts with a similar bread loaf square design but draws it standing up vertically and places a fedora on the top of his head which is combined with the square torso
in contrast to his mindless and wild @-@ eyed expression as a pet the secret agent version of perry is detailed with eyes full of steely blue resolve
povenmire proceeds by drawing his arms which bear hands that are open and prepared for fighting or any danger
his legs are bent as well prepared for an act of danger or action needed
povenmire finishes the design by adding his beaver tail and color
this definition of the character led to phineas and ferb spearheading production of a new toyline based on perry called perry the inaction figure whose tagline revolved around it not doing anything but allowing the customer to make it whatever they desire it to be
in all actuality perry is a skilled fighter who is able to perform several implausible judo fighting moves and escapes
he has access to several different types of technology and inventions provided to him by the o
w
c
a
including a hover craft dubbed the platypusmobile a jet ski and a whistle set that allows him to summon different types of animals
although his appearance as a domestic pet is mostly a cover perry has nonetheless expressed care and devotion for the flynn @-@ fletcher family
in the episode the ballad of bad beard perry managed to drag candace out of the dark cave before it caved in because of dr
doofenshmirthz 's self destruction button that which candace had accidentally pressed while under the orange moss hallucination thinking it was a vending machine
he did this even though he knew that candace saw that perry was a secret agent talking to agent e eagle and to major monogram in a cracked egg
candace thought she was just hallucinating because of the orange moss she accidentally touched earlier in the episode
also when an invention of doofenshmirtz 's in the episode journey to the center of candace might cause severe harm to phineas and ferb perry thoroughly beats up doofenshmirtz and quickly handcuffs him
he then ties him to a pipe and instead of just leaving him like he usually does in the series calls for special forces from the o
w
c
a
to come and arrest the doctor though they never show up
in oh there you are perry doofenshmirtz is downgraded to a low threat level and perry is reassigned to a new nemesis
this causes him to have to leave his home with the flynn @-@ fletchers which makes him sad and he does not enjoy his new villain
phineas and ferb are fearful about where perry could have gone to and put up several flyers around town for people to find him
they decide to throw a concert on the roof of a building singing a song about how much they love perry and want him to come home
concurrently perry is reassigned to doofenshmirtz again and returns to the brothers once more
though perry is anthropomorphic he does not speak only communicating through an aggravated purr type of noise made by flapping his bill
this noise is provided by actor dee bradley baker to this day povenmire and marsh do not understand how baker produces the noise
thomas sangster who plays ferb is notoriously good at making the noise and is considered second only to baker himself
when in his agent p persona perry is almost completely silent
as cynthia littleton of variety magazine wrote perry the platypus is a breakout star from the disney channel toon phineas and ferb
the new york times writer susan stewart called him intrepid
jean yoo a press member for disney channel said that perry is suave and makes james bond look like a rank amateur
aaron h
bynum of animator insider opined that he is indubitably confident
carly h
of scholastic inc
declared perry pretty darn awesome
josh jackson editor of paste described perry and doofenshmirtz 's relationship as pitch @-@ perfect
certain reviewers have also commented negatively about perry and his subplot which sherry robinson of the st
petersburg times considers pretty trippy
kevin mcdonough of sun coast today described it as complicated and loosely connected to the rest of the series writing that he is not sure what this accomplishes except to add the noise of explosions to the already constant din of singing and screaming
ed liu of toon zone feels it is truly puzzling what perry the secret agent is doing in this show in the first place
liu considers his subplot to be a type of throw everything against the wall and see what sticks element and writes that many of the earlier episodes of the show don 't manage to do a very good job of balancing the subplot and the main one
perry was nominated for a nickelodeon kids choice award in <year> under the category of favorite animated animal sidekick
to date he has appeared in all phineas and ferb novelizations published by disney press
the character has been adapted into a <num> inch plush toy released by the walt disney company
the plush has a button on its hand that allows it to emit perry 's signature chattering noise
certain t @-@ shirts based on the series released by both disney and the online retail website zazzle also display perry and the phrase hey where 's perry which most characters like phineas isabella stacy irving ferb and lawrence utter when perry goes to major monogram in his secret lair in almost every episode
there also is a t @-@ shirt with perry 's face
perry appears in the nintendo ds video game based on the series simply titled phineas and ferb where a mini @-@ game involves perry stopping doofenshmirtz 's latest evil scheme
as of <num> april <year> perry is also a playable character in the video game disney <num>
the genus currently comprises four saprotrophic and parasitic species which live off living or dead wood
the amylostereaceae cause white rot in the wood by disintegrating the tissue component lignin
they produce crust @-@ like partially wavy fruit bodies on the surface of infested trees which are similar to those produced by stereum species
there are four described species in the amylostereaceae a
chailletii the type a
areolatum a
ferreum and a
laevigatum
the species were initially considered part of stereum until mycologist jacques boidin found atypical microscopic differences between them
forty years after his extensive researches from <year> boidin reclassified amylostereum into its own family
three amylostereum species are symbionts of wood wasps in the genera sirex urocerus and xoanon which infest conifers
the female wood wasps deposit their eggs together with fungal spores and mucus in trees and the fungus is eaten by the wasp 's larva as food
the fungus propagates vegetatively through the formation of asexual spores in newly emerged females that are stored in special structures adapted for the transport of symbiotic fungi
the a
areolatum – sirex woodwasp s
noctilio symbiont complex has been studied extensively because of its potential to cause substantial economic losses in the forestry industry particularly in non @-@ native regions
mycologist jacques boidin separated amylosterum from stereum in <year> justifying this decision by explaining that microscopic differences such as amyloid spores and encrusted cystidia were sufficiently distinct to warrant recognition as a new genus
although the type species of the genus today called a
chailletii was initially named trichocarpus ambiguus the name trichocarpus had already been used for a genus in the flowering plant family malvaceae
boidin thus chose the genus name amylostereum referring to the amyloid spores
based on dna analysis boidin in <year> moved amylostereum into a new monotypic family the amylostereaceae which he attributed to the hericiales order
later studies however supported the initial classification in the russulales
the next closest relatives might be – depending on the research – either echinodontium tinctorium and most other species of the genus echinodontium or artomyces pyxidatus
most of the previous dna analysis results suggest a narrow relation to echinodontium but several results of studies partially contradict this conclusion
only the classification to the russulales is regarded as correct
some authors have suggested that amylostereum should be placed in the family echinodontiaceae
the similarities between a
chailletii and a
areolatum have caused some confusion regarding their placement in the genus
as only the size of their fruit bodies differ from each other in appearance researcher german josef krieglsteiner assumed that both are the same species in different age stages
experiments with pure cultures of the fungi however showed that the mycelia of a
chailletii a
laevigatum and a
ferreum were partially compatible to each other but the mycelium of a
areolatum was incompatible to other species
boidin believes that the common ancestor of all amylostereum fungi used yellowwoods as a host
this genus of conifers was native in europe until the paleogene and neogene periods <num> million to <num>
<num> million years ago but became extinct there so the amylostereum fungi specialized on other conifers and differentiated into several species
only a
ferreum specialized on yellowwoods in south america
compatibility tests as well as molecular analysis indicated that a
areolatum separated very early from other amylostereum fungi
the other three species separated later from each other and are thus partially compatible to each other
a
ferreum and a
laevigatum produced in <num> of all cases a common mycelium a
ferreum and a
chailletii only in <num>
there is an undescribed species in amylostereum according to dna analysis it stands between a
laevigatum and a
ferreum
this is remarkable as these fungi originated from mycetangae storing organs of platypodinae of a north american wood wasp while a
laevigatum has never been seen as symbiont of wood wasps neither in north american nor in europe
the fungus possibly represents a separated species or a subtaxon of a
laevigatum
as a
areolatum and a
chailletii mainly reproduce asexually through the symbiosis of wood wasps the genetic variability within these species is relatively low
the fruit bodies are <num>
<num> – <num>
<num> mm <num>
<num> – <num>
<num> in thick irregularly shaped and are able to cover a large surface on the bark or otherwise can appear as small spots
they lie directly on the bark
the ochrous grey or brownish fruit body hymenium has a smooth to warty surface texture and is turned outwards
it is bordered by a highly bent and wavy effuso @-@ reflex edge on all species except a
laevigatum which has a churlish surface a tomentum and is usually dirty @-@ brown coloured
in some species the tomentum stands clearly above and forms a kind of roof above the fruit body if it completely surrounds this roof there might appear cuplike shapes
the first type is brownish skeletal hyphae which provide stability to the fruit body
these hyphae run parallel to the bark and often have hairpin @-@ like turns so that the loops form thick @-@ walled cystidium @-@ like structures the so @-@ called pseudocystidia
the second type is generative hyphae
they are translucent hyaline and serve to promote the growth of the fungus
genuine cystidia arise in the hymenium and the layer directly below the subhymenium
both pseudocystidia and cystidia are encrusted meaning that they feature crystal @-@ like structures on the top
with the exception of a
laevigatum all species have a thin separating layer the cortex between the hymenium and the tomentum
a cortex is also present on many stereum fungi on a broader front and serves to bend up the fruit body
as this cortex is missing on a
laevigatum its fruit body lies flat on the bark
the basidia are <num> – <num> × <num>
<num> – <num>
<num> µm and have a slim club @-@ like shape
each basidium features four sterigmata each of which bear one spore
the spores shape is slimly ellipsoidal or cylindrical
their surface is smooth and their walls are thin
although they are colourless and hyaline the spores are amyloid meaning they will turn bluish or purple when stained with melzer 's reagent
this characteristic differs from other very similar species and this gave the genus its name
the introduction of a
areolatum and its symbionts the sirex woodwasps saw the spread of the genus to all continents except antarctica
amylostereum chailletiiz is common in the temperate regions of north america and eurasia
a
laevigatum can be also found in temperate eurasia but it is unclear how broadly this species is distributed in north america
a
areolatum is originally native in north africa and eurasia it was however distributed through the <num> century in australia new zealand southern africa as well as in south and north america
only a
ferreum is originally native in the tropics and is common in brazil and the caribbean
three species – a
areolatum a
laevigatum and a
chailletii – may also establish a symbiosis with wood wasps siricidae which beside freshly logged trees also infest living trees and infect them with fungi
symbioses have been recorded with several species sirex noctilio s
juvencus s
nitobei s
cyaneus s
edwarsii s
nitidus and in japan urocerus antennatus and xoanon matsumurae
wasps of the genera sirex and urocerus store oidia the hypha of fungi split up to spores in special abdominal organs
the wood wasps infect trees by splashing a phytotoxic secretion below the bark and at the same time injecting fungal spores into the hole
the secretion weakens the tree and temporarily diminishes its immune system whereby the fungus can spread along the xylem
the infection with amylostereaceae fulfill two functions for the wasps it provides the larvae food because the white rot softens the wood at the same time the mycelia of the fungi serves as food for the larvae
after the larvae pupate it absorbs the mycelia of the amylostereaceae into its body to oviposit together with its eggs
the fungus benefits from the symbiosis as it spreads faster and more effectively than through airborne spores and furthermore does not need to develop fruit bodies
a
ferreum is the only amylosterum species that has not been associated with any woodwasps
a
chailletii usually infests pinaceae such as firs abies and spruces picea but also cedars cedrus and douglas firs pseudotsuga
a
areolatum has a similar host spectrum which uses mainly firs japanese cedars cryptomeria larches larix spruces pines pinus and douglas firs as hosts
while spruces dominate as hosts in the native habitat this species is more common in pines on other locations
the host spectrum of a
laevigatum comprises cupressaceae such as junipers juniperus or cypresses cupressus and the english yew taxus baccata
a
ferreum is however only common on neotropic yellowwoods podocarpus
they disintegrate the lignin of the host wood whereby the infested wood parts become less stable and take a fibrous structure
the wood bleaches as fungal enzymes break down and remove the brown @-@ pigmented lignin
the distribution in wood takes place mainly along the transport channels in the xylem
if the wood is crosscut the red rot is vertically positioned on which bleached infested areas contrast with intact wood
symptoms of infestion by the symbiotic partner — wood wasps — include circular exit holes in the crust and acute stress through dryness common in hanging falling or tanning needles
the infestation through wood wasps does not assume greater dimensions and is compared with other pests almost insignificant
the infection rates are even lower during sexual reproduction via fruit bodies as the wasps do not play a part in the process
furthermore the amylostereum fungi are alone often incapable of infesting healthy trees
they thus mostly act as saprobiontics
pine monocultures in australia new zealand africa and south america were shown to be susceptible to the sirex woodwasp sirex noctilio which was introduced there and which is associated with a
areolatum
the wasp 's phytotoxic secretion its larvae and the fungus combine very effectively with each other and contribute to forest decline rates of up to <num>
this is mainly owing to the poor water and nutrient supply of the trees which can poorly reconcile the drought stress caused by infestation
s
noctilio was detected in north america in the <num> decade in canada alone the total economic loss to the forestry industry caused by the sirex – amylostereum symbiosis could be as high as <num> million per year for the next <num> years
as a countermeasure cultures of the nematode deladenus siricidicola have been used as biological control to protect trees since the <num>
this parasite feeds on the mycelia of a
areolatum and is therefore a food competitor of wood wasp larvae
where s
noctilio larvae are present the parasite infects and sterilizes the eggs of female wasps causing them to be infertile
these infertile females lay infected eggs into new trees and thus spread the nematode
this control method has proven to be relatively successful to combat the sirex – amylostereum complex
in the southern hemisphere where the technique has been widely employed reductions of parasitism levels of <num> – <num> have been achieved
at the height of his fame in the <num> and <num> he was alongside his friends and colleagues frédéric chopin and franz liszt among the leading pianists in paris a city in which he spent virtually his entire life
alkan earned many awards at the conservatoire de paris which he entered before he was six
his career in the salons and concert halls of paris was marked by his occasional long withdrawals from public performance for personal reasons
although he had a wide circle of friends and acquaintances in the parisian artistic world including eugène delacroix and george sand from <year> he began to adopt a reclusive life style while continuing with his compositions – virtually all of which are for the keyboard
during this period he published among other works his collections of large @-@ scale studies in all the major keys op
<num> and all the minor keys op
<num>
the latter includes his symphony for solo piano op
<num> nos
<num> – <num> and concerto for solo piano op
<num> nos
<num> – <num> which are often considered among his masterpieces and are of great musical and technical complexity
alkan emerged from self @-@ imposed retirement in the <num> to give a series of recitals that were attended by a new generation of french musicians
alkan 's attachment to his jewish origins is displayed both in his life and his work
he was the first composer to incorporate jewish melodies in art music
fluent in hebrew and greek he devoted much time to a complete new translation of the bible into french
this work like many of his musical compositions is now lost
alkan never married but his presumed son élie @-@ miriam delaborde was like alkan a virtuoso performer on both the piano and the pedal piano and edited a number of the elder composer 's works
following his death which according to persistent but unfounded legend was caused by a falling bookcase alkan 's music became neglected supported by only a few musicians including ferruccio busoni egon petri and kaikhosru sorabji
from the late <num> onwards led by raymond lewenthal and ronald smith many pianists have recorded his music and brought it back into the repertoire
alkan morhange was descended from a long @-@ established jewish ashkenazic community in the region of metz the village of morhange is located about <num> miles <num> km from the city of metz
charles @-@ valentin was the second of six children – one elder sister and four younger brothers his birth certificate indicates that he was named after a neighbour who witnessed the birth
alkan morhange supported the family as a musician and later as the proprietor of a private music school in le marais the jewish quarter of paris
at an early age charles @-@ valentin and his siblings adopted their father 's first name as their last and were known by this during their studies at the conservatoire de paris and subsequent careers
his brother napoléon <year> – <year> became professor of solfège at the conservatoire his brother maxim <year> – <year> had a career writing light music for parisian theatres and his sister céleste <year> – <year> was also a pianist
his brother ernest <year> – <year> was a professional flautist while the youngest brother gustave <year> – <year> was to publish various dances for the piano
he entered the conservatoire de paris at an unusually early age and studied both piano and organ
the records of his auditions survive in the archives nationales in paris
at his solfège audition on <num> july <year> when he was just over <num> years <num> months the examiners noted alkan who is referred to even at this early date as alkan valentin and whose age is given incorrectly as six @-@ and @-@ a @-@ half as having a pretty little voice
the profession of alkan morhange is given as music @-@ paper ruler
at charles @-@ valentin 's piano audition on <num> october <year> when he was nearly seven and where he is named as alkan morhange valentin the examiners comment this child has amazing abilities
alkan became a favourite of his teacher at the conservatoire joseph zimmermann who also taught georges bizet césar franck charles gounod and ambroise thomas
at the age of seven alkan won a first prize for solfège and in later years prizes in piano <year> harmony <year> and organ <year>
at the age of seven @-@ and @-@ a @-@ half he gave his first public performance appearing as a violinist and playing an air and variations by pierre rode
alkan 's opus <num> a set of variations for piano based on a theme by daniel steibelt dates from <year> when he was <num> years old
at about this time he also undertook teaching duties at his father 's school
antoine marmontel one of charles @-@ valentin 's pupils there who was later to become his bête noire wrote of the school young children mostly jewish were given elementary musical instruction and also learnt the first rudiments of french grammar
there i received a few lessons from the young alkan four years my senior
i see once more
that really parochial environment where the talent of valentin alkan was formed and where his hard @-@ working youth blossomed
it was like a preparatory school a juvenile annexe of the conservatoire
from about <year> alkan began to appear as a piano soloist in leading parisian salons including those of the princesse de la moskova widow of marshal ney and the duchesse de montebello
he was probably introduced to these venues by his teacher zimmermann
at the same time alkan morhange arranged concerts featuring charles @-@ valentin at public venues in paris in association with leading musicians including the sopranos giuditta pasta and henriette sontag the cellist auguste franchomme and the violinist lambert massart with whom alkan gave concerts in a rare visit out of france to brussels in <year>
in <year> at the age of <num> alkan was appointed joint professor of solfège – among his pupils in this class a few years later was his brother napoléon
in this manner alkan 's musical career was launched well before the july revolution of <year> which initiated a period in which keyboard virtuosity
completely dominated professional music making in the capital attracting from all over europe pianists who as heinrich heine wrote invaded like a plague of locusts swarming to pick paris clean
alkan nonetheless continued his studies and in <year> enrolled in the organ classes of françois benoist from whom he may have learnt to appreciate the music of johann sebastian bach of whom benoist was then one of the few french advocates
he became a friend of many who were active in the world of the arts in paris including franz liszt who had been based there since <year> george sand and victor hugo
it is not clear exactly when he first met frédéric chopin who arrived in paris in september <year>
in <year> alkan took the solo role in his first concerto da camera for piano and strings at the conservatoire
in the same year aged <num> he was elected to the influential société académique des enfants d 'apollon society of the children of apollo whose members included luigi cherubini fromental halévy the conductor françois habeneck and liszt who had been elected in <year> at the age of twelve
between <year> and <year> alkan participated at many of the society 's concerts
alkan twice competed unsuccessfully for the prix de rome in <year> and again in <year> the cantatas which he wrote for the competition hermann et ketty and l 'entrée en loge have remained unpublished and unperformed
in <year> alkan began his friendship with the spanish musician santiago masarnau which was to result in an extended and often intimate correspondence which only came to light in <year>
like virtually all of alkan 's correspondence this exchange is now one @-@ sided all of his papers including his manuscripts and his extensive library were either destroyed by alkan himself as is clear from his will or became lost after his death
later in <year> alkan made a visit to england where he gave recitals and where the second concerto da camera was performed in bath by its dedicatee henry ibbot field it was published in london together with some solo piano pieces
a letter to masarnau and a notice in a french journal that alkan played in london with moscheles and cramer indicate that he returned to england in <year>
later that year alkan having found a place of retreat at piscop outside paris completed his first truly original works for solo piano the twelve caprices published in <year> as opp
<num> <num> <num> and <num>
op
<num> the trois scherzi de bravoure is dedicated to masarnau
in january <year> liszt recommended alkan for the post of professor at the geneva conservatoire which alkan declined and in <year> he wrote an enthusiastic review of alkan 's op
<num> caprices in the revue et gazette musicale
chopin and alkan were personal friends and often discussed musical topics including a work on musical theory that chopin proposed to write
by <year> at <num> years old alkan had reached a peak of his career
he frequently gave recitals his more mature works had begun to be published and he often appeared in concerts with liszt and chopin
on <num> april <year> alkan took part in liszt 's farewell concert in paris together with the <num> @-@ year @-@ old césar franck and the virtuoso johann peter pixis
on <num> march <year> at a concert at the piano @-@ maker pape alkan played with chopin zimmerman and chopin 's pupil adolphe gutmann in a performance of alkan 's transcription now lost of two movements of beethoven 's seventh symphony for two pianos eight hands
at this point for a period which coincided with the birth and childhood of his natural son élie @-@ miriam delaborde <year> – <year> alkan withdrew into private study and composition for six years returning to the concert platform only in <year>
alkan neither asserted or denied his paternity of delaborde which however his contemporaries seemed to assume
marmontel wrote cryptically in a biography of delaborde that his birth is a page from a novel in the life of a great artist
alkan gave early piano lessons to delaborde who was to follow his natural father as a keyboard virtuoso
alkan 's return to the concert platform in <year> was greeted with enthusiasm by critics who noted the admirable perfection of his technique and lauded him as a model of science and inspiration a sensation and an explosion
they also commented on the attending celebrities including liszt chopin sand and dumas
in the same year he published his piano étude le chemin de fer which critics following ronald smith believe to be the first representation in music of a steam engine
between <year> and <year> alkan produced a series of virtuoso pieces the <num> préludes op
<num> for piano or organ and the sonata op
<num> les quatre âges
following an alkan recital in <year> the composer giacomo meyerbeer was so impressed that he invited the pianist whom he considered a most remarkable artist to prepare the piano arrangement of the overture to his forthcoming opera le prophète
meyerbeer heard and approved alkan 's arrangement of the overture for four hands which alkan played with his brother napoléon in <year> published in <year> it is the only record of the overture which was scrapped during rehearsals at the opéra
a disgusted alkan described the appointment in a letter to sand as the most incredible the most shameful nomination and delacroix noted in his journal by his confrontation with auber alkan has been very put out and will doubtless continue to be so
the upset arising from this incident may account for alkan 's reluctance to perform in public in the ensuing period
his withdrawal was also influenced by the death of chopin in <year> he wrote to masarnau i have lost the strength to be of any economic or political use and lamented the death of poor chopin another blow which i felt deeply
chopin on his deathbed in <year> had indicated his respect for alkan by bequeathing him his unfinished work on a piano method intending him to complete it and after chopin 's death a number of his students transferred to alkan
after giving two concerts in <year> alkan withdrew in spite of his fame and technical accomplishment into virtual seclusion for some twenty years
little is known of this period of alkan 's life other than that apart from composing he was immersed in the study of the bible and the talmud
throughout this period alkan continued his correspondence with ferdinand hiller whom he had probably met in paris in the <num> and with masarnau from which some insights can be gained
it appears that alkan completed a full translation into french now lost of both the old testament and the new testament from their original languages
in <year> he wrote to hiller having translated a good deal of the apocrypha i 'm now onto the second gospel which i am translating from the syriac
in starting to translate the new testament i was suddenly struck by a singular idea – that you have to be jewish to be able to do it
despite his seclusion from society this period saw the composition and publication of many of alkan 's major piano works including the douze études dans tous les tons mineurs op
<num> <year> the sonatine op
<num> <year> the <num> esquisses op
<num> <year> and the five collections of chants <year> – <year> as well as the sonate de concert for cello and piano op
<num> <year>
these did not pass unremarked hans von bülow for example gave a laudatory review of the op
<num> études in the neue berliner musikzeitung in <year> the year in which they were published in berlin commenting that alkan is unquestionably the most eminent representative of the modern piano school at paris
the virtuoso 's disinclination to travel and his firm reputation as a teacher explain why at present so little attention has been given to his work in germany
from the early <num> alkan began to turn his attention seriously to the pedal piano pédalier
alkan gave his first public performances on the pédalier to great critical acclaim in <year>
from <year> onwards he began to publish pieces designated as for organ or piano à pédalier
it may have been associated with the developing career of delaborde who returning to paris in <year> soon became a concert fixture including in his recitals many works by his father and who was at the end of <year> given the appointment that had escaped alkan himself professor at the conservatoire
the success of the petits concerts led to them becoming an annual event with occasional interruptions caused by alkan 's health until <year> or possibly beyond
the petits concerts featured music not only by alkan but of his favourite composers from bach onwards played on both the piano and the pédalier and occasionally with the participation of another instrumentalist or singer
he was assisted in these concerts by his siblings and by other musicians including delaborde camille saint @-@ saëns and auguste franchomme
those encountering alkan at this phase included the young vincent d 'indy who recalled alkan 's skinny hooked fingers playing bach on an érard pedal piano i listened riveted to the spot by the expressive crystal @-@ clear playing
alkan later played beethoven 's op
<num> sonata of which d 'indy said what happened to the great beethovenian poem
i couldn 't begin to describe – above all in the arioso and the fugue where the melody penetrating the mystery of death itself climbs up to a blaze of light affected me with an excess of enthusiasm such as i have never experienced since
this was not liszt — perhaps less perfect technically — but it had greater intimacy and was more humanly moving
the biographer of chopin frederick niecks sought alkan for his recollections in <year> but was sternly denied access by alkan 's concierge – to my
enquiry when he could be found at home the reply was a
decisive never
however a few days later he found alkan at érard 's and niecks writes of their meeting that his reception of me was not merely polite but most friendly
alkan was buried on <num> april easter sunday in the jewish section of montmartre cemetery paris not far from the tomb of his contemporary fromental halévy his sister céleste was later buried in the same tomb
for many years it was believed that alkan met his death when a bookcase toppled over and fell on him as he reached for a volume of the talmud from a high shelf
this tale which was circulated by the pianist isidor philipp is dismissed by hugh macdonald who reports the discovery of a contemporary letter by one of his pupils explaining that alkan had been found prostrate in his kitchen under a porte @-@ parapluie a heavy coat umbrella rack after his concierge heard his moaning
he had possibly fainted bringing it down on himself while grabbing out for support
he was reportedly carried to his bedroom and died later that evening
the story of the bookcase may have its roots in a legend told of aryeh leib ben asher rabbi of metz the town from which alkan 's family originated
his intelligent and original physiognomy deserves to be taken in profile or head @-@ on
the head is strong the deep forehead is that of a thinker the mouth large and smiling the nose regular the years have whitened the beard and hair
the gaze fine a little mocking
his stooped walk his puritan comportment give him the look of an anglican minister or a rabbi – for which he has the abilities
alkan was not always remote or aloof
chopin describes in a letter to friend visiting the theatre with alkan in <year> to see the comedian arnal arnal tells the audience how he was desperate to pee in a train but couldn 't get to a toilet before they stopped at orléans
there wasn 't a single vulgar word in what he said but everyone understood and split their sides laughing
hugh macdonald notes that alkan particularly enjoyed the patronage of russian aristocratic ladies des dames très parfumées et froufroutantes highly perfumed and frilled ladies as isidore philipp described them
alkan 's aversion to socialising and publicity especially following <year> appeared to be self @-@ willed
liszt is reported to have commented to the danish pianist frits hartvigson that alkan possessed the finest technique he had ever known but preferred the life of a recluse
stephanie mccallum has suggested that alkan may have suffered from asperger syndrome schizophrenia or obsessive – compulsive disorder
alkan 's later correspondence contains many despairing comments
in a letter of about <year> he wrote to hiller i 'm becoming daily more and more misanthropic and misogynous
nothing worthwhile good or useful to do
no one to devote myself to
my situation makes me horridly sad and wretched
even musical production has lost its attraction for me for i can 't see the point or goal
this spirit of anomie may have led him to reject requests in the <num> to play in public or to allow performances of his orchestral compositions
however it should not be ignored that he was writing similarly frantic self @-@ analyses in his letters of the early <num> to masarnau
jack gibbons writes of alkan 's personality alkan was an intelligent lively humorous and warm person all characteristics which feature strongly in his music whose only crime seems to have been having a vivid imagination and whose occasional eccentricities mild when compared with the behaviour of other highly @-@ strung artistes stemmed mainly from his hypersensitive nature
macdonald however suggests that alkan was a man of profoundly conservative ideas whose lifestyle manner of dress and belief in the traditions of historic music set him apart from other musicians and the world at large
his grandfather marix morhange had been a printer of the talmud in metz and was probably a melamed hebrew teacher in the jewish congregation at paris
alkan 's widespread reputation as a student of the old testament and religion and the high quality of his hebrew handwriting testify to his knowledge of the religion and many of his habits indicate that he practised at least some of its obligations such as maintaining the laws of kashrut
alkan was regarded by the paris consistory the central jewish organisation of the city as an authority on jewish music
in <year> he assisted the consistory in evaluating the musical ability of samuel naumbourg who was subsequently appointed as hazzan cantor of the main paris synagogue and he later contributed choral pieces in each of naumbourg 's collections of synagogue music <year> and <year>
alkan was appointed organist at the synagogue de nazareth in <year> although he resigned the post almost immediately for artistic reasons
alkan 's op
<num> set of préludes includes a number of pieces based on jewish subjects including some titled prière prayer one preceded by a quote from the song of songs and another titled ancienne mélodie de la synagogue old synagogue melody
the collection is believed to be the first publication of art music specifically to deploy jewish themes and ideas
alkan 's three settings of synagogue melodies prepared for his former pupil zina de mansouroff are further examples of his interest in jewish music kessous dreyfuss provides a detailed analysis of these works and their origins
other works evidencing this interest include no
<num> of his op
<num>
<num> grands préludes et <num> transcription <year> entitled alla giudesca and marked con divozione a parody of excessive hazzanic practice and the slow movement of the cello sonata op
<num> <year> which is prefaced by a quotation from the old testament prophet micah and uses melodic tropes derived from the cantillation of the haftarah in the synagogue
the inventory of alkan 's apartment made after his death indicates over <num> volumes in hebrew or related to judaism left to his brother napoléon as well as <num> volumes of music manuscript
these are all lost
bequests in his will to the conservatoire to found prizes for composition of cantatas on old testament themes and for performance on the pedal @-@ piano and to a jewish charity for the training of apprentices were refused by the beneficiaries
she mentions that hans von bülow called him the berlioz of the piano while schumann in criticising the op
<num> romances claimed that alkan merely imitated berlioz on the piano
she further notes that ferruccio busoni repeated the comparison with berlioz in a draft but unpublished monograph while kaikhosru sorabji commented that alkan 's op
<num> sonatine was like a beethoven sonata written by berlioz
berlioz was ten years older than alkan but did not attend the conservatoire until <year>
the two were acquainted and were perhaps both influenced by the unusual ideas and style of anton reicha who taught at the conservatoire from <year> to <year> and by the sonorities of the composers of the period of the french revolution
they both created individual indeed idiosyncratic sound @-@ worlds in their music there are however major differences between them
alkan unlike berlioz remained closely dedicated to the german musical tradition his style and composition were heavily determined by his pianism whereas berlioz could hardly play at the keyboard and wrote nothing for piano solo
alkan 's works therefore also include miniatures and among his early works salon music genres which berlioz avoided
alkan 's attachment to the music of his predecessors is demonstrated throughout his career from his arrangements for keyboard of beethoven 's seventh symphony <year> and of the minuet of mozart 's <num> symphony <year> through the sets souvenirs des concerts du conservatoire <year> and <year> and the set souvenirs de musique de chambre <year> which include transcriptions of music by mozart beethoven j
s
bach haydn gluck and others
in this context should be mentioned alkan 's extensive cadenza for beethoven 's <num> piano concerto <year> which includes quotes from the finale of beethoven 's <num> symphony
alkan 's transcriptions together with original music of bach beethoven handel mendelssohn couperin and rameau were frequently played during the series of petits concerts given by alkan at erard
as regards the music of his own time alkan was unenthusiastic or at any rate detached
he commented to hiller that wagner is not a musician he is a disease
while he admired berlioz 's talent he did not enjoy his music
at the petits concerts little more recent than mendelssohn and chopin both of whom had died around <num> years before the series of concerts was initiated was played except for alkan 's own works and occasionally some by his favourites such as saint @-@ saëns
chopin writes pianist and academic kenneth hamilton alkan 's musical output was centred almost exclusively on the piano
some of his music requires extreme technical virtuosity clearly reflecting his own abilities often calling for great velocity enormous leaps at speed long stretches of fast repeated notes and the maintenance of widely spaced contrapuntal lines
the illustration right from the grande sonate is analysed by smith as six parts in invertible counterpoint plus two extra voices and three doublings – eleven parts in all
some typical musical devices such as a sudden explosive final chord following a quiet passage were established at an early stage in alkan 's compositions
macdonald suggests that unlike wagner alkan did not seek to refashion the world through opera nor like berlioz to dazzle the crowds by putting orchestral music at the service of literary expression nor even as with chopin or liszt to extend the field of harmonic idiom
armed with his key instrument the piano he sought incessantly to transcend its inherent technical limits remaining apparently insensible to the restrictions which had withheld more restrained composers
however not all of alkan 's music is either lengthy or technically difficult for example many of the op
<num> préludes and of the set of esquisses op
<num>
moreover in terms of structure alkan in his compositions sticks to traditional musical forms although he often took them to extremes as he did with piano technique
the study op
<num> no
<num> the first movement of the concerto for solo piano takes almost half an hour in performance
describing this gigantic piece ronald smith comments that it convinces for the same reasons as does the music of the classical masters the underlying unity of its principal themes and a key structure that is basically simple and sound
some of alkan 's music gives hints of the obsessiveness which some have detected in his personality
the chant op
<num> no
<num> entitled fa repeats the note of its title incessantly in total <num> times against shifting harmonies which make it cut
into the texture with the ruthless precision of a laser beam
in modelling his five sets of chants on the first book of mendelssohn 's songs without words alkan ensured that the pieces in each of his sets followed precisely the same key signatures and even the moods of the original
alkan was rigorous in his enharmonic spelling occasionally modulating to keys containing double @-@ sharps or double @-@ flats so pianists are occasionally required to come to terms with unusual keys such as e @-@ sharp major enharmonic equivalent to f major and the occasional triple @-@ sharp
industrious rather than
creative
only with his <num> caprices opp
<num> – <num> and <num> – <num> <year> did his compositions begin to attract serious critical attention
the op
<num> set souvenirs trois morceaux dans le genre pathétique dedicated to liszt contains le vent the wind which was at one time the only piece by the composer to figure regularly in recitals
these works however did not meet with the approval of robert schumann who wrote one is startled by such false such unnatural art
the last piece titled morte death is a crabbed waste overgrown with brush and weeds
nothing is to be found but black on black
ronald smith however finds in this latter work which cites the dies irae theme also used by berlioz liszt and others foreshadowings of maurice ravel modest mussorgsky and charles ives
schumann did however respond positively to the pieces of les mois originally part published as op
<num> in <year> later published as a complete set in <year> as op
<num> here we find such an excellent jest on operatic music in no
<num> l 'opéra that a better one could scarcely be imagined
the composer
well understands the rarer effects of his instrument
alkan 's technical mastery of the keyboard was asserted by the publication in <year> of the trois grandes études originally without opus number later republished as op
<num> the first for the left hand alone the second for the right hand alone the third for both hands and all of great difficulty described by smith as a peak of pianistic transcendentalism
this is perhaps the earliest example of writing for a single hand as an entity in its own right capable of covering all registers of the piano of rendering itself as accompanied soloist or polyphonist
<num> for violin and piano dedicated to chrétien urhan and his piano trio op
<num> appeared in <year>
apart from these alkan published only a few minor works between <year> and <year> after which a series of virtuoso works was issued many of which he had played at his successful recitals at érard and elsewhere these included the marche funèbre op
<num> the marche triomphale op
<num> and le chemin de fer also published separately as op
<num>
in <year> appeared the op
<num> préludes and his first large @-@ scale unified piano work the grande sonate les quatre âges op
<num>
the sonata is structurally innovative in two ways each movement is slower than its predecessor and the work anticipates the practice of progressive tonality beginning in d major and ending in g @-@ sharp minor
dedicated to alkan morhange the sonata depicts in its successive movements its hero at the ages of <num> optimistic <num> quasi @-@ faust impassioned and fatalistic <num> domesticated and <num> suffering the movement is prefaced by a quotation from aeschylus 's prometheus unbound
in <year> followed alkan 's set of <num> études dans tous les tons majeurs op
<num> whose substantial pieces range in mood from the hectic allegro barbaro no
<num> and the intense chant d 'amour @-@ chant de mort song of love – song of death no
<num> to the descriptive and picturesque l 'incendie au village voisin the fire in the next village no
<num>
a number of alkan 's compositions from this period were never performed and have been lost
among the missing works are some string sextets and a full @-@ scale orchestral symphony in b minor which was described in an article in <year> by the critic léon kreutzer to whom alkan had shown the score
kreutzer noted that the introductory adagio of the symphony was headed by hebrew characters in red ink
this is no less than the verse from genesis and god said let there be light and there was light
kreutzer opined that set beside alkan 's conception joseph haydn 's creation was a mere candle lampion
<num> studies and that of his next group of piano works in <year> and <year>
of these undoubtedly the most significant was the enormous opus <num> collection of twelve studies in all the minor keys which contains the symphony for solo piano numbers four five six and seven and the concerto for solo piano numbers eight nine and ten

smith describes op
<num> as a whole as a towering achievement gathering
the most complete manifestation of alkan 's many @-@ sided genius its dark passion its vital rhythmic drive its pungent harmony its occasionally outrageous humour and above all its uncompromising piano writing
in the same year appeared the sonate de concert op
<num> for cello and piano among the most difficult and ambitious in the romantic repertoire
anticipating mahler in its juxtaposition of the sublime and the trivial and with its four movements showing again an anticipation of progressive tonality each ascending by a major third
other anticipations of mahler who was born in <year> can be found in the two military op
<num> piano studies of <year> capriccio alla soldatesca and le tambour bat aux champs the drum beats the retreat as well as in certain of the miniatures of the <year> esquisses op

they were preceded in publication by alkan 's deceptively titled sonatine op
<num> in classical format but a work of ruthless economy which although it plays for less than twenty minutes
is in every way a major work
two of alkan 's substantial works from this period are musical paraphrases of literary works
salut cendre du pauvre op

<num> <year> is a blow @-@ by @-@ blow recreation in music of the emotions and prophecies of psalm <num> by the waters of babylon

this piece is prefaced by a french version of the psalm which is believed to be the sole remnant of alkan 's bible translation
alkan 's lyrical side was displayed in this period by the five sets of chants inspired by mendelssohn which appeared between <year> and <year> as well as by a number of minor pieces
alkan 's publications for organ or pédalier commenced with his benedictus op
<num> <year>
in the same year he published a set of very spare and simple preludes in the eight gregorian modes <year> without opus number which in smith 's opinion seem to stand outside the barriers of time and space and which he believes reveal alkan 's essential spiritual modesty
these were followed by pieces such as the <num> prières prayers op
<num> <year> and the impromptu sur le choral de luther un fort rempart est notre dieu op
<num> <year>
alkan also issued a book of <num> studies for the pedalboard alone no opus number <year> and the bombardo @-@ carillon for pedalboard duet four feet of <year>
alkan 's return to the concert platform at his petits concerts however marked the end of his publications his final work to be issued was the toccatina op

rubinstein dedicated his fifth piano concerto to him and franck dedicated to alkan his grand pièce symphonique op
<num> for organ
busoni ranked alkan with liszt chopin schumann and brahms as one of the five greatest composers for the piano since beethoven
isidor philipp and delaborde edited new printings of his works in the early <num>
in the first half of the twentieth century when alkan 's name was still obscure busoni and petri included his works in their performances
sorabji published an article on alkan in his <year> book around music he promoted alkan 's music in his reviews and criticism and his sixth symphony for piano symphonia claviensis <year> – <num> includes a section entitled quasi alkan
the english composer and writer bernard van dieren praised alkan in an essay in his <year> book down among the dead men and the composer humphrey searle also called for a revival of his music in a <year> essay
for much of the <num> century alkan 's work remained in obscurity but from the <num> onwards it was steadily revived
raymond lewenthal gave a pioneering extended broadcast on alkan on wbai radio in new york in <year> and later included alkan 's music in recitals and recordings
the english pianist ronald smith championed alkan 's music through performances recordings a biography and the alkan society of which he was president for many years
works by alkan have also been recorded by jack gibbons marc @-@ andré hamelin mark latimer john ogdon and hüseyin sermet among many others

alkan 's compositions for organ have been among the last of his works to be brought back to the repertoire
as to alkan 's pedal @-@ piano works due to a recent revival of the instrument they are once again being performed as originally intended rather than on an organ such as by italian pedal @-@ pianist roberto prosseda and recordings of alkan on the pedal piano have been made by jean dubé and olivier latry

written by brent forrester and directed by buffy the vampire slayer and firefly creator joss whedon the episode aired on nbc on february <num> <year>
in the episode michael is invited by ryan to speak to his business school class
when many of the students question the usefulness of paper in a computerized world michael attempts to inform the class of how essential paper is
meanwhile a bat becomes trapped in the office leading dwight and creed on a mission to protect the employees
j
novak invites michael scott steve carell to speak at his business school class
michael is excited but ryan admits in a talking head interview that he has only invited michael because his professor promised to bump up the grade of any student who brings his boss into class
during his introduction of michael to his classmates ryan predicts that dunder mifflin will become obsolete within five to ten years
however michael could not hear him and proceeds to ruin the event with his antics including tearing pages out of a student 's textbook to prove you can 't learn from textbooks
michael is then taken aback when one of ryan 's classmates asks for michael 's opinion of ryan 's prediction
infuriated and hurt michael punishes ryan by relocating his desk to the annex where kelly kapoor mindy kaling works who babbles uncontrollably in excitement
meanwhile dwight schrute rainn wilson discovers a bat in the ceiling and accidentally lets it loose into the office sending the employees scurrying for cover
stanley immediately goes home
as many of the employees hide dwight enlists the help of creed creed bratton to expel the bat
jim halpert john krasinski exploits dwight 's paranoia and pretends that he is turning into a vampire
dwight eventually catches the bat with a garbage bag after it lands on meredith 's head
pam beesly jenna fischer in the meantime invites her co @-@ workers to her art show after work but few show any enthusiasm leaving her feeling alienated and sad
the art show doesn 't go as planned and she begins to doubt her abilities
when oscar martinez oscar nunez shows up with his partner gil they critique her art and note that pam 's art has been let down by her lack of courage not realizing that she is standing right behind them
as she begins to take her work down michael appears and in a moment of sincere kindness compliments her work and asks to buy her drawing of the office building
pam embraces him as her eyes tear up
michael soon places pam 's drawing on the wall next to his office
forrester had previously written the merger
the episode was the first to be directed by joss whedon
whedon who is a friend of both producer greg daniels and jenna fischer and also met most of the production staff prior to the episode stated that he chose to direct the episode because i already know the writing staff and a bunch of the cast and i adore the show
when informed that the episode was about a bat entering into the office and one of the characters pretending to be a vampire whedon thought that it was a joke stating didn 't i just leave this party in reference to buffy the vampire slayer
in an interview featured on the third season dvd whedon joked that the business school episode and his former tv show were very similar because buffy
was sad and depressing but
it was funny
especially when people died
and a lot of people do die in business school
but upon completing the episode whedon stated that was just coincidence
but that 's how that happened
god it was fun
whedon stated that he was surprised with the amount of input he was allowed with the script
i wouldn 't say freedom to do things with it
but way more input was asked for than i would have ever anticipated
at pam 's art show the pieces which she was supposed to have painted didn 't suit whedon
i got to the set and saw pam 's art and i was like this is not right
whedon said that he held up filming for over an hour until the staff was able create new pieces of art
for the scenes which involved filming with a bat the production team used an actual bat an animated bat and a mechanical bat
when around the actual bat kate flannery who portrays meredith palmer stated that we had to be extremely quiet around it basically pretending to scream
california state university northridge served as the backdrop for ryan 's business school and the art show
brian zoromski of ign stated that business school was an exercise in what works best in an office episode
zoromski also praised joss whedon 's directorial debut for the show stating that whedon 's direction and sense of humor was both excellently put to use and alluded to in the scenes in which jim hilariously pretended to become a vampire
zoromski went on to say that the acting of john krasinski and rashida jones who portrays karen filippelli helped to make the vampire scenes the funniest parts of the episode
he gave the episode a <num>
<num> out of <num>
abby west of entertainment weekly stated that this show has always been able to turn on a dime and take the comedy to a soul @-@ stirring dramatic climax with just the lightest of touches and last night was no different
west went on to praise michael and pam 's scene at the art show as one of these moments
the trunkline travels from the city of saginaw at the junction with m @-@ <num> to the junction with m @-@ <num> east of cass city over the county line in greenleaf township in northwestern sanilac county in the thumb area of the state
outside of the cities and villages along its route m @-@ <num> passes through mostly rural farm country
near saginaw it intersects the freeway that carries both interstate <num> i @-@ <num> and us highway <num> us <num> in an industrial area
a road bearing the m @-@ <num> designation has existed since at least july <num> <year> when the state initially numbered its trunkline highways
since that time it has been extended rerouted or shortened several times
these changes resulted in essentially the modern highway routing by <year> the highway was fully paved in the <num>
a change made in <year> was reversed in <year> and an extension through downtown saginaw in the <num> was overturned in the <num>
the last change was the construction of a pair of roundabouts at the i @-@ <num> us <num> interchange in <year>
this central feature ends for m @-@ <num> immediately east of the intersection as the highway runs east out of saginaw
the trunkline follows washington road easterly through residential subdivisions to an interchange with i @-@ <num> us <num> in an industrial area of buena vista township
this interchange exit <num> along the freeway is built with roundabouts on either side of the bridge that carries washington road over the freeway in a variant of the diamond interchange design called a dumbbell interchange
after leaving the industrial properties on the east side of i @-@ <num> us <num> m @-@ <num> follows washington road through a mixture of farm fields and residential subdivisions
north of the community of arthur the highway intersects m @-@ <num> vassar road
further east m @-@ <num> crosses out of saginaw county across the border in tuscola county the highway follows saginaw road
in the village of reese m @-@ <num> crosses the huron and eastern railway twice
east of town the highway follows caro road through more farm fields through the community of watrousville
near the south side of the tuscola area airport m @-@ <num> turns to the northeast running along the cass river to caro
in the city the trunkline follows state street past the fairgrounds
at the intersection with ellington street m @-@ <num> crosses m @-@ <num>
the highway continues northeasterly out of town and through the community of ellington
northeast of elmwood m @-@ <num> turns due east along cass city road
the trunkline runs to the village of cass city where it follows main street through residential neighborhoods and the central business district
east of cass city the highway crosses the cass river before crossing the county line into sanilac county
approximately one mile <num>
<num> km into the county m @-@ <num> ends at the intersection with m @-@ <num> van dyke road
m @-@ <num> is maintained by the michigan department of transportation mdot like other state highways in michigan
as a part of these maintenance responsibilities the department tracks the volume of traffic that uses the roadways under its jurisdiction
these volumes are expressed using a metric called annual average daily traffic which is a statistical calculation of the average daily number of vehicles on a segment of roadway
mdot 's surveys in <year> showed that the highest traffic levels along m @-@ <num> were the <num> @,@ <num> vehicles daily between van gelsen road and frank street in caro the lowest counts were the <num> @,@ <num> vehicles per day east of cass city to the m @-@ <num> intersection
no sections of m @-@ <num> have been listed on the national highway system a network of roads important to the country 's economy defense and mobility
by <year> the eastern end was extended southerly from caro to mayville along a highway that is now part of m @-@ <num>
in late <year> the western end was changed so that m @-@ <num> followed the former m @-@ <num> from reese into saginaw and the eastern end was rerouted from caro northeasterly to the cass city area
with the exception of the routing through downtown saginaw the highway followed the approximate routing of the current highway
in the latter half of <year> the highway was rerouted between saginaw and reese using a set of parallel roadways to the south of the previous routing this change was reversed in <year>
m @-@ <num> was fully paved when the last section between ellington and elmwood in tuscola county was finished in late <year> or early <year>
starting in <year> the westernmost approximately one mile <num>
<num> km of m @-@ <num> was also used for a us <num> concurrency
when the bypass of saginaw was completed in late <year> m @-@ <num> was extended along m @-@ <num> southwesterly into downtown saginaw where it turned west across the saginaw river to midland road west of the city
this routing across the city was removed in <year> when i @-@ <num> was completed west of that freeway the highway became m @-@ <num> the rest was either removed from the highway system and turned back to local control or it had the m @-@ <num> designation removed
since this truncation m @-@ <num> has ended at its junction with m @-@ <num> north of downtown saginaw
in <year> mdot completed the reconstruction of the interchange between m @-@ <num> and i @-@ <num> us to incorporate a pair of roundabouts along washington road
it is about <num> cm <num> in long and has glossy black plumage with a metallic sheen which is speckled with white at some times of year
the legs are pink and the bill is black in winter and yellow in summer young birds have browner plumage than the adults
it is a noisy bird especially in communal roosts and other gregarious situations with an unmusical but varied song
its gift for mimicry has been noted in literature including the mabinogion and the works of pliny the elder and william shakespeare
the common starling has about a dozen subspecies breeding in open habitats across its native range in temperate europe and western asia and it has been introduced to australia new zealand canada united states mexico peru argentina the falkland islands brazil chile uruguay south africa and fiji
this bird is resident in southern and western europe and southwestern asia while northeastern populations migrate south and west in winter within the breeding range and also further south to iberia and north africa
the common starling builds an untidy nest in a natural or artificial cavity in which four or five glossy pale blue eggs are laid
these take two weeks to hatch and the young remain in the nest for another three weeks
there are normally one or two breeding attempts each year
this species is omnivorous taking a wide range of invertebrates as well as seeds and fruit
it is hunted by various mammals and birds of prey and is host to a range of external and internal parasites
large flocks typical of this species can be beneficial to agriculture by controlling invertebrate pests however starlings can also be pests themselves when they feed on fruit and sprouting crops
common starlings may also be a nuisance through the noise and mess caused by their large urban roosts
introduced populations in particular have been subjected to a range of controls including culling but these have had limited success except in preventing the colonisation of western australia
the species has declined in numbers in parts of northern and western europe since the <num> due to fewer grassland invertebrates being available as food for growing chicks
despite this its huge global population is not thought to be declining significantly so the common starling is classified as being of least concern by the international union for conservation of nature
sturnus and vulgaris are derived from the latin for starling and common respectively
the old english staer later stare and the latin sturnus are both derived from an unknown indo @-@ european root dating back to the second millennium bc
starling was first recorded in the <num> century when it referred to the juvenile of the species but by the <num> century it had already largely supplanted stare to refer to birds of all ages
the older name is referenced in william butler yeats poem the stare 's nest by my window
the international ornithological congress preferred english vernacular name is common starling
the starling family sturnidae is an entirely old world group apart from introductions elsewhere with the greatest numbers of species in southeast asia and sub @-@ saharan africa
the genus sturnus is polyphyletic and relationships between its members are not fully resolved
the closest relation of the common starling is the spotless starling
the non @-@ migratory spotless starling may be descended from a population of ancestral s
vulgaris that survived in an iberian refugium during an ice age retreat and mitochondrial gene studies suggest that it could be considered as a subspecies of the common starling
there is more genetic variation between common starling populations than between nominate common starling and spotless starling
although common starling remains are known from the middle pleistocene part of the problem in resolving relationships in the sturnidae is the paucity of the fossil record for the family as a whole
the gradual variation over geographic range and extensive intergradation means that acceptance of the various subspecies varies between authorities
subspecies birds from fair isle st kilda and the outer hebrides are intermediate in size between s
v
zetlandicus and the nominate form and their subspecies placement varies according to the authority
the dark juveniles typical of these island forms are occasionally found in mainland scotland and elsewhere indicating some gene flow from faroensis or zetlandicus subspecies formerly considered to be isolated
several other subspecies have been named but are generally no longer considered valid
most are intergrades that occur where the ranges of various subspecies meet
these include s
v
ruthenus menzbier <year> and s
v
jitkowi buturlin <year> which are intergrades between vulgaris and poltaratskyi from western russia s
v
graecus tschusi <year> and s
v
balcanicus buturlin and harms <year> intergrades between vulgaris and tauricus from the southern balkans to central ukraine and throughout greece to the bosporus and s
v
heinrichi stresemann <year> an intergrade between caucasicus and nobilior in northern iran
s
v
persepolis ticehurst <year> from southern iran 's fars province is very similar to s
v
vulgaris and it is not clear whether it is a distinct resident population or simply migrants from southeastern europe

the plumage is iridescent black glossed purple or green and spangled with white especially in winter
the underparts of adult male common starlings are less spotted than those of adult females at a given time of year
the throat feathers of males are long and loose and are used in display while those of females are smaller and more pointed
the legs are stout and pinkish- or greyish @-@ red
the bill is narrow and conical with a sharp tip in the winter it is brownish @-@ black but in summer females have lemon yellow beaks while males have yellow bills with blue @-@ grey bases
moulting occurs once a year- in late summer after the breeding season has finished the fresh feathers are prominently tipped white breast feathers or buff wing and back feathers which gives the bird a speckled appearance
the reduction in the spotting in the breeding season is achieved through the white feather tips largely wearing off
juveniles are grey @-@ brown and by their first winter resemble adults though often retaining some brown juvenile feathering especially on the head
they can usually be sexed by the colour of the irises rich brown in males mouse @-@ brown or grey in females
estimating the contrast between an iris and the central always @-@ dark pupil is <num> accurate in determining sex rising to <num> if the length of the throat feathers is also considered
the common starling is mid @-@ sized by both starling standards and passerine standards
it is readily distinguished from other mid @-@ sized passerines such as thrushes icterids or small corvids by its relatively short tail sharp blade @-@ like bill round @-@ bellied shape and strong sizeable and rufous @-@ coloured legs
in flight its strongly pointed wings and dark colouration are distinctive while on the ground its strange somewhat waddling gait is also characteristic
the colouring and build usually distinguish this bird from other starlings although the closely related spotless starling may be physically distinguished by the lack of iridescent spots in adult breeding plumage
like most terrestrial starlings the common starling moves by walking or running rather than hopping
their flight is quite strong and direct their triangular @-@ shaped wings beat very rapidly and periodically the birds glide for a short way without losing much height before resuming powered flight
when in a flock the birds take off almost simultaneously wheel and turn in unison form a compact mass or trail off into a wispy stream bunch up again and land in a coordinated fashion
common starling on migration can fly at <num> – <num> km h <num> – <num> mph and cover up to <num> @,@ <num> – <num> @,@ <num> km <num> – <num> mi
several terrestrial starlings including those in the genus sturnus have adaptations of the skull and muscles that help with feeding by probing
this adaptation is most strongly developed in the common starling along with the spotless and white @-@ cheeked starlings where the protractor muscles responsible for opening the jaw are enlarged and the skull is narrow allowing the eye to be moved forward to peer down the length of the bill
this technique involves inserting the bill into the ground and opening it as a way of searching for hidden food items
common starlings have the physical traits that enable them to use this feeding technique which has undoubtedly helped the species spread far and wide
in iberia the western mediterranean and northwest africa the common starling may be confused with the closely related spotless starling the plumage of which as its name implies has a more uniform colour
at close range it can be seen that the latter has longer throat feathers a fact particularly noticeable when it sings
its song consists of a wide variety of both melodic and mechanical @-@ sounding noises as part of a ritual succession of sounds
the male is the main songster and engages in bouts of song lasting for a minute or more
each of these typically includes four varieties of song type which follow each other in a regular order without pause
the bout starts with a series of pure @-@ tone whistles and these are followed by the main part of the song a number of variable sequences that often incorporate snatches of song mimicked from other species of bird and various naturally occurring or man @-@ made noises
the structure and simplicity of the sound mimicked is of greater importance than the frequency with which it occurs
each sound clip is repeated several times before the bird moves on to the next
after this variable section comes a number of types of repeated clicks followed by a final burst of high @-@ frequency song again formed of several types
each bird has its own repertoire with more proficient birds having a range of up to <num> variable song types and as many as <num> types of clicks
males sing constantly as the breeding period approaches and perform less often once pairs have bonded
in the presence of a female a male sometimes flies to his nest and sings from the entrance apparently attempting to entice the female in
older birds tend to have a wider repertoire than younger ones
those males that engage in longer bouts of singing and that have wider repertoires attract mates earlier and have greater reproductive success than others
females appear to prefer mates with more complex songs perhaps because this indicates greater experience or longevity
having a complex song is also useful in defending a territory and deterring less experienced males from encroaching
singing also occurs outside the breeding season taking place throughout the year apart from the moulting period
the songsters are more commonly male although females also sing on occasion
the function of such out @-@ of @-@ season song is poorly understood
eleven other types of call have been described including a flock call threat call attack call snarl call and copulation call
the alarm call is a harsh scream and while foraging together common starlings squabble incessantly
they chatter while roosting and bathing making a great deal of noise that can cause irritation to people living nearby
when a flock of common starlings is flying together the synchronised movements of the birds wings make a distinctive whooshing sound that can be heard hundreds of metres yards away
although flock size is highly variable huge noisy flocks murmurations may form near roosts
these dense concentrations of birds are thought to be a defence against attacks by birds of prey such as peregrine falcons or eurasian sparrowhawks
flocks form a tight sphere @-@ like formation in flight frequently expanding and contracting and changing shape seemingly without any sort of leader
each common starling changes its course and speed as a result of the movement of its closest neighbours
very large roosts exceptionally up to <num>
<num> million birds can form in city centres woodlands or reedbeds causing problems with their droppings
these may accumulate up to <num> cm <num> in deep killing trees by their concentration of chemicals
in smaller amounts the droppings act as a fertiliser and therefore woodland managers may try to move roosts from one area of a wood to another to benefit from the soil enhancement and avoid large toxic deposits
huge flocks of more than a million common starlings may be observed just before sunset in spring in southwestern jutland denmark over the seaward marshlands of tønder and esbjerg municipalities between tønder and ribe
they gather in march until northern scandinavian birds leave for their breeding ranges by mid @-@ april
their swarm behaviour creates complex shapes silhouetted against the sky a phenomenon known locally as sort sol black sun
flocks of anything from five to fifty thousand common starlings form in areas of the uk just before sundown during mid @-@ winter
these flocks are commonly called murmurations
the food range includes spiders crane flies moths mayflies dragonflies damsel flies grasshoppers earwigs lacewings caddisflies flies beetles sawflies bees wasps and ants
both adults and larvae are consumed and common starlings will also feed on earthworms snails small amphibians and lizards
while the consumption of invertebrates is necessary for successful breeding common starlings are omnivorous and can also eat grains seeds fruits nectar and food waste if the opportunity arises
the sturnidae differ from most birds in that they cannot easily metabolise foods containing high levels of sucrose although they can cope with other fruits such as grapes and cherries
the isolated azores subspecies of the common starling eats the eggs of the endangered roseate tern
measures are being introduced to reduce common starling populations by culling before the terns return to their breeding colonies in spring
there are several methods by which common starlings obtain their food but for the most part they forage close to the ground taking insects from the surface or just underneath
generally common starlings prefer foraging amongst short @-@ cropped grasses and are often found among grazing animals or perched on their backs where they will also feed on the mammal 's external parasites
large flocks may engage in a practice known as roller @-@ feeding where the birds at the back of the flock continually fly to the front where the feeding opportunities are best
the larger the flock the nearer individuals are to one another while foraging
flocks often feed in one place for some time and return to previous successfully foraged sites
there are three types of foraging behaviour observed in the common starling
probing involves the bird plunging its beak into the ground randomly and repetitively until an insect has been found and is often accompanied by bill gaping where the bird opens its beak in the soil to enlarge a hole
this behaviour first described by konrad lorenz and given the german term zirkeln is also used to create and widen holes in plastic garbage bags
it takes time for young common starlings to perfect this technique and because of this the diet of young birds will often contain fewer insects
hawking is the capture of flying insects directly from the air and lunging is the less common technique of striking forward to catch a moving invertebrate on the ground
earthworms are caught by pulling from soil
common starlings that have periods without access to food or have a reduction in the hours of light available for feeding compensate by increasing their body mass by the deposition of fat
the amount of green material is not important as long as some is present but the presence of herbs in the decorative material appears to be significant in attracting a mate
the scent of plants such as yarrow acts as an olfactory attractant to females
the males sing throughout much of the construction and even more so when a female approaches his nest
following copulation the male and female continue to build the nest
nests may be in any type of hole common locations include inside hollowed trees buildings tree stumps and man @-@ made nest @-@ boxes
s
v
zetlandicus typically breeds in crevices and holes in cliffs a habitat only rarely used by the nominate form
nests are typically made out of straw dry grass and twigs with an inner lining made up of feathers wool and soft leaves
construction usually takes four or five days and may continue through incubation
common starlings are both monogamous and polygamous although broods are generally brought up by one male and one female occasionally the pair may have an extra helper
pairs may be part of a colony in which case several other nests may occupy the same or nearby trees
males may mate with a second female while the first is still on the nest
the reproductive success of the bird is poorer in the second nest than it is in the primary nest and is better when the male remains monogamous
following copulation the female lays eggs on a daily basis over a period of several days
if an egg is lost during this time she will lay another to replace it
there are normally four or five eggs that are ovoid in shape and pale blue or occasionally white and they commonly have a glossy appearance
the colour of the eggs seems to have evolved through the relatively good visibility of blue at low light levels
the egg size is <num>
<num> – <num>
<num> mm <num>
<num> – <num>
<num> in in length and <num>
<num> – <num>
<num> mm <num>
<num> – <num>
<num> in in maximum diameter
incubation lasts thirteen days although the last egg laid may take <num> hours longer than the first to hatch
both parents share the responsibility of brooding the eggs but the female spends more time incubating them than does the male and is the only parent to do so at night when the male returns to the communal roost
the young are born blind and naked
they develop light fluffy down within seven days of hatching and can see within nine days
once the chicks are able to regulate their body temperature about six days after hatching the adults largely cease removing droppings from the nest
prior to that the fouling would wet both the chicks plumage and the nest material thereby reducing their effectiveness as insulation and increasing the risk of chilling the hatchlings
nestlings remain in the nest for three weeks where they are fed continuously by both parents
fledglings continue to be fed by their parents for another one or two weeks
a pair can raise up to three broods per year frequently reusing and relining the same nest although two broods is typical or just one north of 48on
within two months most juveniles will have moulted and gained their first basic plumage
they acquire their adult plumage the following year
as with other passerines the nest is kept clean and the chicks faecal sacs are removed by the adults
intraspecific brood parasites are common in common starling nests
female floaters unpaired females during the breeding season present in colonies often lay eggs in another pair 's nest
fledglings have also been reported to invade their own or neighbouring nests and evict a new brood
common starling nests have a <num> to <num> rate of successful fledging although only <num> of nestlings survive to breeding age the adult survival rate is closer to <num>
the average life span is about <num> – <num> years with a longevity record of <num> yr <num> m
the typical response of starling groups is to take flight with a common sight being undulating flocks of starling flying high in quick and agile patterns
their abilities in flight are seldom matched by birds of prey
adult common starlings are hunted by hawks such as the northern goshawk accipiter gentilis and eurasian sparrowhawk accipiter nisus and falcons including the peregrine falcon falco peregrinus eurasian hobby falco subbuteo and common kestrel falco tinnunculus
slower raptors like black and red kites milvus migrans milvus eastern imperial eagle aquila heliaca common buzzard buteo buteo and australasian harrier circus approximans tend to take the more easily caught fledglings or juveniles
while perched in groups by night they can be vulnerable to owls including the little owl athene noctua long @-@ eared owl asio otus short @-@ eared owl asio flammeus barn owl tyto alba tawny owl strix aluco and eurasian eagle @-@ owl bubo bubo
more than twenty species of hawk owl and falcon are known to occasionally predate feral starlings in north america though the most regular predators of adults are likely to be urban @-@ living peregrine falcons or merlins falco columbarius
common mynas acridotheres tristis sometimes evict eggs nestlings and adult common starlings from their nests and the lesser honeyguide indicator minor a brood parasite uses the common starling as a host
starlings are more commonly the culprits rather than victims of nest eviction however especially towards other starlings and woodpeckers
nests can be raided by animals capable of climbing to them such as stoats mustela erminea raccoons procyon lotor and squirrels sciurus spp
and cats may catch the unwary
common starlings are hosts to a wide range of parasites
a survey of three hundred common starlings from six us states found that all had at least one type of parasite <num> had external fleas mites or ticks and <num> carried internal parasites mostly various types of worm
blood @-@ sucking species leave their host when it dies but other external parasites stay on the corpse
a bird with a deformed bill was heavily infested with mallophaga lice presumably due to its inability to remove vermin
the hen flea ceratophyllus gallinae is the most common flea in their nests
the small pale house @-@ sparrow flea c
fringillae is also occasionally found there and probably arises from the habit of its main host of taking over the nests of other species
this flea does not occur in the us even on house sparrows
lice include menacanthus eurystemus brueelia nebulosa and stumidoecus sturni
other arthropod parasites include ixodes ticks and mites such as analgopsis passerinus boydaia stumi dermanyssus gallinae ornithonyssus bursa o
sylviarum proctophyllodes species pteronyssoides truncatus and trouessartia rosteri
the hen mite d
gallinae is itself preyed upon by the predatory mite androlaelaps casalis
the presence of this control on numbers of the parasitic species may explain why birds are prepared to reuse old nests
flying insects that parasitise common starlings include the louse @-@ fly omithomya nigricornis and the saprophagous fly camus hemapterus
the latter species breaks off the feathers of its host and lives on the fats produced by growing plumage
larvae of the moth hofmannophila pseudospretella are nest scavengers which feed on animal material such as faeces or dead nestlings
protozoan blood parasites of the genus haemoproteus have been found in common starlings but a better known pest is the brilliant scarlet nematode syngamus trachea
this worm moves from the lungs to the trachea and may cause its host to suffocate
in britain the rook and the common starling are the most infested wild birds
other recorded internal parasites include the spiny @-@ headed worm prosthorhynchus transverses
common starlings may contract avian tuberculosis avian malaria and retrovirus @-@ induced lymphomas
captive starlings often accumulate excess iron in the liver a condition that can be prevented by adding black tea @-@ leaves to the food
widespread throughout the northern hemisphere the bird is native to eurasia and is found throughout europe northern africa from morocco to egypt india mainly in the north but regularly extending further south and extending into the maldives nepal the middle east including syria iran and iraq and north @-@ western china
common starlings in the south and west of europe and south of latitude 40on are mainly resident although other populations migrate from regions where the winter is harsh the ground frozen and food scarce
large numbers of birds from northern europe russia and ukraine migrate south westwards or south eastwards
in the autumn when immigrants are arriving from eastern europe many of britain 's common starlings are setting off for iberia and north africa
other groups of birds are in passage across the country and the pathways of these different streams of bird may cross
of the <num> @,@ <num> birds ringed as nestlings in merseyside england individuals have been recovered at various times of year as far afield as norway sweden finland russia ukraine poland germany and the low countries
small numbers of common starling have sporadically been observed in japan and hong kong but it is unclear from where these birds originated
in north america northern populations have developed a migration pattern vacating much of canada in winter
birds in the east of the country move southwards and those from further west winter in the southwest of the us
common starlings prefer urban or suburban areas where artificial structures and trees provide adequate nesting and roosting sites
reedbeds are also favoured for roosting and the birds commonly feed in grassy areas such as farmland grazing pastures playing fields golf courses and airfields where short grass makes foraging easy
they occasionally inhabit open forests and woodlands and are sometimes found in shrubby areas such as australian heathland
common starlings rarely inhabit dense wet forests i
e
rainforests or wet sclerophyll forests but are found in coastal areas where they nest and roost on cliffs and forage amongst seaweed
their ability to adapt to a large variety of habitats has allowed them to disperse and establish themselves in diverse locations around the world resulting in a habitat range from coastal wetlands to alpine forests from sea cliffs to mountain ranges <num> @,@ <num> m <num> @,@ <num> ft above sea level
as a result it has also been able to migrate to thailand southeast asia and new guinea
in <year> a small population of common starlings was observed nesting in gardens in the city of buenos aires
since then despite some initial attempts at eradication the bird has been expanding its breeding range at an average rate of <num>
<num> km <num>
<num> mi per year keeping within <num> km <num> mi of the atlantic coast
in argentina the species makes use of a variety of natural and man @-@ made nesting sites particularly woodpecker holes
early settlers looked forward to their arrival believing that common starlings were also important for the pollination of flax a major agricultural product
nest @-@ boxes for the newly released birds were placed on farms and near crops
the common starling was introduced to melbourne in <year> and sydney two decades later
by the <num> established populations were present in the southeast of the country thanks to the work of acclimatisation committees
by the <num> common starlings were widespread throughout victoria queensland and new south wales but by then they were considered to be pests
although common starlings were first sighted in albany western australia in <year> they have been largely prevented from spreading to the state
the wide and arid nullarbor plain provides a natural barrier and control measures have been adopted that have killed <num> @,@ <num> birds over three decades
the common starling has also colonised lord howe island and norfolk island
native birds were not habituated to living in close proximity to man so the common starling was introduced from europe to control the pests
it was first brought over in <year> by the nelson acclimatisation society and other introductions followed
the birds soon became established and are now found all over the country including the subtropical kermadec islands to the north and the equally distant macquarie island far to the south
he was president of the american acclimatization society which tried to introduce every bird species mentioned in the works of william shakespeare into north america
about the same date the portland song bird club released <num> pairs of common starlings in portland oregon
these birds became established but disappeared around <year>
common starlings reappeared in the pacific northwest in the mid @-@ <num> and these birds were probably descendants of the <year> central park introduction
the original <num> birds have since swelled in number to <num> million occupying an area extending from southern canada and alaska to central america
it may have colonised from new zealand via raoul in the kermadec islands where it is abundant that group being roughly equidistant between new zealand and fiji
its spread in fiji has been limited and there are doubts about the population 's viability
tonga was colonised at about the same date and the birds there have been slowly spreading north through the group
it spread slowly and by <year> had reached clanwilliam and port elizabeth
it is now common in the southern cape region thinning out northwards to the johannesburg area
it is present in the western cape the eastern cape and the free state provinces of south africa and lowland lesotho with occasional sightings in kwazulu @-@ natal gauteng and around the town of oranjemund in namibia
in southern africa populations appear to be resident and the bird is very much associated with man his habitations and pastures
it favours irrigated land and is absent from regions where the ground is baked so dry that it cannot probe for insects
it may compete with native birds for crevice nesting sites but the indigenous species are probably more disadvantaged by destruction of their natural habitat than they are by inter @-@ specific competition
it breeds from september to december and outside the breeding season may congregate in large flocks often roosting in reedbeds
it is the most common bird species in urban and agricultural areas
this bird is fairly common but local in jamaica grand bahama and bimini and is rare in the rest of the bahamas eastern cuba the cayman islands puerto rico and st
croix
it had shown a marked increase in numbers throughout europe from the <num> century to around the <num> and <num>
in about <year> s
v
vulgaris expanded its range in the british isles spreading into ireland and areas of scotland where it had formerly been absent although s
v
zetlandicus was already present in shetland and the outer hebrides
the common starling has bred in northern sweden from <year> and in iceland from <year>
the breeding range spread through southern france to northeastern spain and there were other range expansions particularly in italy austria and finland
it started breeding in iberia in <year> while the spotless starling 's range had been expanding northward since the <num>
the low rate of advance about <num>
<num> km <num>
<num> mi per year for both species is due to the suboptimal mountain and woodland terrain
expansion has since slowed even further due to direct competition between the two similar species where they overlap in southwestern france and northwestern spain
major declines in populations have been observed from <year> onward in sweden finland northern russia karelia and the baltic states and smaller declines in much of the rest of northern and central europe
the bird has been adversely affected in these areas by intensive agriculture and in several countries it has been red @-@ listed due to population declines of more than <num>
numbers dwindled in the united kingdom by more than <num> between <year> and <year> although populations in some areas such as northern ireland were stable or even increased those in other areas mainly england declined even more sharply
the overall decline seems to be due to the low survival rate of young birds which may be caused by changes in agricultural practices
the intensive farming methods used in northern europe mean there is less pasture and meadow habitat available and the supply of grassland invertebrates needed for the nestlings to thrive is correspondingly reduced
around <num> million nest boxes were erected for this species in the former soviet union and common starlings were found to be effective in controlling the grass grub costelytra zelandica in new zealand
the original australian introduction was facilitated by the provision of nest boxes to help this mainly insectivorous bird to breed successfully and even in the us where this is a pest species the department of agriculture acknowledges that vast numbers of insects are consumed by common starlings
common starlings introduced to areas such as australia or north america where other members of the genus are absent may affect native species through competition for nest holes
in north america chickadees nuthatches woodpeckers purple martins and other swallows may be affected
in australia competitors for nesting sites include the crimson and eastern rosellas
for its role in the decline of local native species and the damages to agriculture the common starling has been included in the iucn list of the world 's <num> worst invasive species
common starlings can eat and damage fruit in orchards such as grapes peaches olives currants and tomatoes or dig up newly sown grain and sprouting crops
they may also eat animal feed and distribute seeds through their droppings
in eastern australia weeds like bridal creeper blackberry and boneseed are thought to have been spread by common starlings
agricultural damage in the us is estimated as costing about us <num> million annually
this bird is not considered to be as damaging to agriculture in south africa as it is in the united states
the large size of flocks can also cause problems
common starlings may be sucked into aircraft jet engines one of the worst instances of this being an incident in boston in <year> when sixty @-@ two people died after a turboprop airliner flew into a flock and plummeted into the sea at winthrop harbor
starlings droppings can contain the fungus histoplasma capsulatum the cause of histoplasmosis in humans
at roosting sites this fungus can thrive in accumulated droppings
there are a number of other infectious diseases that can potentially be transmitted by common starlings to humans although the potential for the birds to spread infections may have been exaggerated
within the natural breeding range this may be affected by legislation
for example in spain this is a species hunted commercially as a food item and has a close season whereas in france it is classed as a pest and the season in which it may be killed covers the greater part of the year
in the uk the common starling may be killed at any time of year
this species is migratory so birds involved in control measures may have come from a wide area and breeding populations may not be greatly affected
in europe the varying legislation and mobile populations mean that control attempts may have limited long @-@ term results
non @-@ lethal techniques such as scaring with visual or auditory devices have only a temporary effect in any case
huge urban roosts in cities can create problems due to the noise and mess made and the smell of the droppings
in <year> so many birds landed on the clock hands of london 's big ben that it stopped leading to unsuccessful attempts to disrupt the roosts with netting repellent chemical on the ledges and broadcasts of common starling alarm calls
an entire episode of the goon show in <year> was a parody of the futile efforts to disrupt the large common starling roosts in central london
where it is introduced the common starling is unprotected by legislation and extensive control plans may be initiated
common starlings can be prevented from using nest boxes by ensuring that the access holes are smaller than the <num>
<num> in <num> mm diameter they need and the removal of perches discourages them from visiting bird feeders
western australia banned the import of common starlings in <year>
new flocks arriving from the east are routinely shot while the less cautious juveniles are trapped and netted
new methods are being developed such as tagging one bird and tracking it back to establish where other members of the flock roost
another technique is to analyse the dna of australian common starling populations to track where the migration from eastern to western australia is occurring so that better preventive strategies can be used
by <year> only <num> common starlings were left in western australia and the state committed a further a <num> @,@ <num> in that year to continue the eradication programme
in the united states common starlings are exempt from the migratory bird treaty act which prohibits the taking or killing of migratory birds
no permit is required to remove nests and eggs or kill juveniles or adults
research was undertaken in <year> to identify a suitable avicide that would both kill common starlings and would readily be eaten by them
it also needed to be of low toxicity to mammals and not likely to cause the death of pets that ate dead birds
the chemical that best fitted these criteria was drc @-@ <num> now marketed as starlicide
in <year> the united states government poisoned shot or trapped <num>
<num> million birds the largest number of any nuisance species to be destroyed
in <year> the population in the united states was estimated at <num> million birds around <num> of the global total of <num> million
austrian ethologist konrad lorenz wrote of them in his book king solomon 's ring as the poor man 's dog and something to love because nestlings are easily obtained from the wild and after careful hand rearing they are straightforward to look after
they adapt well to captivity and thrive on a diet of standard bird feed and mealworms
several birds may be kept in the same cage and their inquisitiveness makes them easy to train or study
the only disadvantages are their messy and indiscriminate defecation habits and the need to take precautions against diseases that may be transmitted to humans
as a laboratory bird the common starling is second in numbers only to the domestic pigeon
the common starling 's gift for mimicry has long been recognised
in the medieval welsh mabinogion branwen tamed a common starling taught it words and sent it across the irish sea with a message to her brothers bran and manawydan who then sailed from wales to ireland to rescue her
pliny the elder claimed that these birds could be taught to speak whole sentences in latin and greek and in henry iv william shakespeare had hotspur declare the king forbade my tongue to speak of mortimer
but i will find him when he is asleep and in his ear i 'll holler mortimer nay i 'll have a starling shall be taught to speak nothing but mortimer and give it to him to keep his anger still in motion
mozart had a pet common starling which could sing part of his piano concerto in g major kv
<num>
he had bought it from a shop after hearing it sing a phrase from a work he wrote six weeks previously which had not yet been performed in public
he became very attached to the bird and arranged an elaborate funeral for it when it died three years later
it has been suggested that his a musical joke k
<num> might be written in the comical inconsequential style of a starling 's vocalisation
other people who have owned common starlings report how adept they are at picking up phrases and expressions
the words have no meaning for the starling so they often mix them up or use them on what to humans are inappropriate occasions in their songs
their ability at mimicry is so great that strangers have looked in vain for the human they think they have just heard speak
common starlings are trapped for food in some mediterranean countries
