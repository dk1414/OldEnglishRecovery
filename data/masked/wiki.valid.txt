 Homarus gammaru[MASK] , known as the[MASK]Europ[MASK]an lobster or co[MASK]mon lobster , is a species of clawed lobster from the eastern Atlantic [MASK]cean , Mediterranean Sea and parts of the Black Sea . It i[MASK] closely related to the Amer[MASK]can lobster , H. americanus . It may grow to a length of 60 cm ( 24 in ) and a mass of 6 ki[MASK]ograms ( 13 lb ) [MASK] and be[MASK]rs a conspicuous pair of claws . In life , the lobsters are blue , only becoming " [MASK]obster red " on cooking . Mating oc[MASK]urs in the summer , producing egg[MASK] which are carried by the females for up to a year before hatching i[MASK]to planktonic larvae . Homarus gammarus is a highly esteemed food , and is widely caught using lobster pots , mostly around the British Isles . 
 
 = = Description = = 
 
 Homarus gammarus is a large crustacean , with a body length up to 60 centimetres ( 24 in ) and weighing up to 5 – 6 kilograms ( 11 – 13 lb ) , although the lobsters caught in lobster pots are usually 23 – 38 cm ( 9 – 15 [MASK]n ) [MASK]ong and weigh 0 @.@ 7 – 2 @.@ 2 kg ( 1 @.@ 5 – 4 @.@ 9 lb )[MASK]. Like other crustaceans , lobsters hav[MASK] a hard exoskeleton which they must shed in order to grow , in a process called ecdysis ( moulting ) .[MASK]This may occur several times a year for young lobsters , but decreas[MASK]s to once every 1 – 2 years for larger animals . 
 The firs[MASK] pai[MASK] of pereiopods is armed with a lar[MASK]e , asymmetrical pair of claws . The larger one is the " crusher " , and has rounded nodules used for crushing prey ; the other [MASK]s the " cu[MASK]ter " , which has sharp inner edges , and is used for holding or tearing the prey . Usually , the left claw is the crusher , and [MASK]he right is the cutter . 
 The exoskeleton is generally blue above , with spots that[MASK]coalesce , and yell[MASK]w below . T[MASK]e red colour associated with [MASK]obsters only appears after cooking . This occurs because , in life , the red pigment[MASK]astaxanthin is bound to a p[MASK]otein complex , but the complex is broken up by [MASK]he heat of cooking , releas[MASK]ng the red pigment . 
 The closest relative of H. gammarus is the A[MASK]erican lobster [MASK] Homarus americanus . The two species are very similar , an[MASK] can be crossed artifici[MASK]lly , a[MASK]though hybrids a[MASK]e unlikely to occur in the wild [MASK]inc[MASK] their ranges do not overlap . The two species can be disting[MASK]ished by a number of characteristics : 
 [MASK]he rostrum of H. americanus bears one or more s[MASK]ines on the underside , [MASK]hich are lacking in[MASK]H. gamm[MASK]rus . 
 The spines on the claws of H. [MASK]mericanus are red or red[MASK]@-@ tipped , while those of H. gammarus are white or white @-@ tipped . 
 The underside of the claw of H. americanus is orange or red , while that of[MASK]H. gammar[MASK]s is creamy white or very [MASK]ale red . 
[MASK]
[MASK]= = Life cycle = = 
 
 Female H. gammarus reach sexual maturity when they have grown to a carapace[MASK]length of 80 –[MASK]85 millimetres ( 3 @.@ 1 – 3 @.@ [MASK] in ) , whereas males m[MASK]ture at a slightly s[MASK]aller size . Mating typically occurs in summer between a recently moulted female , whose sh[MASK]ll is therefore soft , and a hard @-@ shelled male . T[MASK]e female carries the eggs for up to 12 months , depending[MASK]on the temperature , attached t[MASK] her pleo[MASK]ods . Females ca[MASK]rying eggs are said to be " berried " and can be found throughout t[MASK]e year . 
 The eggs hatch at night , and the larvae swim to the water surface wh[MASK]re they drift with the [MASK]cean currents , prey[MASK]ng on zooplankton . This stage involves three moults and lasts for 15 – 35 days . After the third moult , [MASK]he juvenile takes on a form closer to the adult , and adopts a benthic lifestyle . The juveniles are rarely seen in [MASK]he wild , and are poo[MASK]ly[MASK]known , although they are known to be capable of digging extensive burrows . It is estim[MASK]ted [MASK]hat only 1 larva in every 20 @,@ 000 survives to the benthic phase . When they reach a carapace length of 15 mm ( 0 @.@ 59 in ) , the juveniles leave the[MASK]r burrows and start their adult lives . 
 
 = = Distributio[MASK] = = 
 
 Homarus gammarus is foun[MASK] across the no[MASK]th @-@ eastern Atlantic Ocean from northern Norway to the[MASK]Azores and Mor[MASK][MASK]co , not including the Baltic Sea . It is also present in most of the Mediterranean Sea , only mis[MASK]i[MASK]g from the section east of[MASK]Crete , and along only the north @-@ west coast of the Black Sea . The northernmost populatio[MASK]s are found in the Norwegian[MASK]fjords Tysfjorden and Nord[MASK]olda , inside the Arctic Circle . 
 The species can be divided into four genetically distinct populations , one widespread population , and three which have diverged [MASK]ue to small effective population sizes , possibly due to adaptation to the loc[MASK]l environme[MASK]t . The first of these is th[MASK] population of lobsters from northern Norway , which have been referred to as the " midnight @-@ sun lobster " . The popula[MASK]ions in the [MASK]editerranean Sea are distinct from those in the Atlantic Ocean . The last distinct population is found in the Netherlands : samples from the Oosterschelde were distinct from those collected in the Nor[MASK]h Sea or English Channel . 
 Attemp[MASK]s have been made to introduce H. gammarus to New Zealand[MASK], al[MASK]ngside other[MASK]European species such as the edible crab , Cancer pagurus . Between 190[MASK] and 1914 , one million lobster larvae were released from hatcheries in Dunedin , but the species did not become established there . 
 
 = = Ecology = = 
 
 Adult H. gamm[MASK]rus live[MASK]on the contin[MASK]n[MASK]al shelf at depths of 0 – 150 metres ( 0 [MASK] 492 ft ) , although[MASK]not normally deeper than 50 m ( 160 ft ) . They prefer hard substrates , such as rocks or hard mud , and live in holes or crevices , emerging at night to feed . 
 T[MASK]e diet of H. gammarus mostly consists of other benthic inverteb[MASK]ates . These include crabs , mollus[MASK]s , sea urchins , starfish an[MASK] polychaete worms . 
 The [MASK]hree clawed lobster spe[MASK]ies Homarus gammarus , H. americanus and Nephrops norvegicus are hosts to the three known [MASK]pecies of the [MASK]nimal phylum Cycliophora ; the species on H. gammarus has not been described . 
 Homarus gammarus is susceptible to the disease ga[MASK]fkaemia , caused by the bacterium Aerococcus viridan[MASK] . Alt[MASK]ough it is frequently found in American lobsters , the disease has only been seen in captive H. gammarus , where prior occupation of the tanks by H. americanus could not be ruled out . 
 
 = = Human consumption = = 
 
 Homarus gammarus is traditionally " highly esteemed " [MASK]s a foodstuff and was mentioned i[MASK] " The Crabfish " a seventeenth century En[MASK]lish folk song . It[MASK]may f[MASK]tch very high prices a[MASK]d may be sold fresh , frozen[MASK], canne[MASK] or powdered . Both the claws and the abd[MASK]men of H. gammarus contain " excellent " white meat , and most of[MASK]the contents of the cephalothorax are edible . The exceptions are the gastric mill and the " sand vein " ( gut ) . The price of H. gammarus is up to three[MASK]times higher than that of H. americanus , and the European species is [MASK]onsidered to have a better flavour . 
 Lobsters are mostly fished using lobster pots , although lines baited[MASK]with octopus or [MASK]uttlefish sometimes succeed in tempting them out[MASK], to allow them to be caught in a net or by hand [MASK] In 2008 , 4 @,@ 386 t of H. gammarus were caught across Europe [MASK]nd North Africa , of whi[MASK]h 3 @,@ 462 t ( 79 % ) was caught in the British Isles ( including the Channel Island[MASK] ) . The minimum landing size for H. gammarus is a carapace length of 87 mm ( 3 @.@ 4 in ) . 
 Aquacu[MASK]ture s[MASK][MASK]tems for H. gammarus are under development , and production[MASK]rates are still very[MASK]low . 
 
 = = Taxonomic history = = 
 
 Homarus gammarus was first given [MASK][MASK]binomial name by Carl Linnaeus in th[MASK] tenth edition of his Systema Naturae , published in 175[MASK] . That name was Cancer gammarus , since Linnaeu[MASK] ' concept of the genus Cancer at that time[MASK]in[MASK]lude[MASK] all large crustaceans . 
 H. gammarus is the type species of the genu[MASK] Homarus Weber , 1795 , as determi[MASK]ed by Direction 51 of the Internat[MASK]onal Commission on Zoological Nomenclature . Prior[MASK]to that direction , confusion a[MASK]ose because the species had been referred to by several different n[MASK]mes , inc[MASK]uding Astacus [MASK]arinus Fabricius ,[MASK]1775 and Homaru[MASK] vulgaris H. Milne @-@ Edwa[MASK]ds , 1837 , and also because Friedrich Weber 's description of the genus h[MASK]d been overlooked until rediscovered by Mary Rathbun , rendering any prior assignments of type species ( for Homarus H. Milne @-@ Edw[MASK]rds , 1837 ) invalid for Homarus Weber , 17[MASK]5 .[MASK]
 The type specimen of Homarus ga[MASK]marus was a lectotype selec[MASK]ed by Lipke Holthuis in 1974 . It came from 57 ° 53 ′ N 11 ° 32 ′ E , near Marstrand , Sweden ( 48 kilometres or 30 miles northwest of Gothenburg ) , but both it[MASK]and the paralectotypes have since been lost . 
 The common name fo[MASK] H. gammarus preferred by the Food an[MASK] Agricult[MASK]re Organiz[MASK]tion is " European lobster " [MASK] but the species is also widely known as the " common lobster " .

 Air Vice Marshal Frank Headlam ,[MASK]CB , CBE ( 15 J[MASK]ly 1914 – 23 December 1976 ) was a senior commander i[MASK] the Royal Australian Air For[MASK][MASK] ( RAAF ) . Born and educated in Tasmania , he joined the RA[MASK]F as an air cadet in January 1934 . He specialised[MASK]in flying instruction a[MASK]d navigation before the outbreak of World War II . In April 1941 , he became commanding of[MASK]icer of No. 2 Squadron , which operated Lockheed[MASK]Hudsons . The squadron was deployed to Dutch Timor in December[MASK], and saw action against Japanese forces in the South West Pacific . A[MASK]ter returning to Australia in February 1942 , Headlam held staf[MASK] appointments and training commands , finishing the war a group captain . 
 Headlam served as Officer Commanding North @-@ Western Area in 1946 , and as Director of Training from 1947 to 1950 . In 1950 – 51 , during the Mala[MASK]an Emergenc[MASK] , he was stationed at Singapore as com[MASK]ander of No. 90 ( Composite ) Wing and , later , RAF Tengah . He twice served as acting Air[MASK]Member for Personnel , in 1957 and 1959 – 60 , receiving appointment as a Commander of the Order of the British Empire in 1958 . [MASK]romot[MASK][MASK] air vice marshal , he successively held the positions of Air Offi[MASK]er Commanding ( AOC ) Operational Command in 1961 – 62 , AOC No. 224 Group RAF from 1962 to 1965 during the Indonesia – Malaysia Konfrontasi , Deputy Chief of the Air Staff in 1965 – 66 , and[MASK]AOC [MASK]upport Command in 1966 – 67 .[MASK]He was appointed a Companion of [MASK]he Order of the [MASK]ath in 1965 . Follow[MASK]ng a posting to London as Head of[MASK]the Australian Joint Services Staff from 1968 to[MASK]1971 , he retired from the Air Force and died in Mel[MASK]ourne five years later .

 The son of [MASK]armers Malcolm and Hilda Headlam , Frank Headlam was born on 1[MASK] July 1914 in L[MASK]unceston , Tasmania . He was schooled at Clemes College , Hobart , and matriculated in 1932 . Against the wishes of his parents he joined the Royal Australian Air Force ( RAAF ) as an air cadet on 16 January 1934 . He underwent flying instruction with No. 1 Flying Training School ( FTS ) at RAAF Point Cook , Victoria , and was commissioned as a p[MASK]lot [MASK]fficer on 1 January 193[MASK] . 
 After completing a conversion course , Headlam was assigned to the Seaplane Squadron at Point Cook . No larger than a flight according [MASK]o [MASK]he official history of the pre @-@ war RAAF , Seaplane Squadron [MASK]as part of No. 1 FTS and operated Supermarine Southampton flying boats and de Havilland Gipsy Moth floatplanes , among other types . During this posting Headlam was promoted to flying officer , on 1 July 1935 , and wrote a paper on nati[MASK]nal defence in which he suggeste[MASK] that with " stro[MASK]g [MASK]ir forces[MASK], naval [MASK]orces ( including submarines ) , and[MASK]fixed defences , Australia may be made practically[MASK]invulnerable " . According to Air Force historian Alan Stephens , [MASK]his paper " in effect , defined th[MASK] ' anti @-@ lodgment ' concept which has been a pe[MASK]sistent feature of RAAF strategic thinking " . 
 Headlam completed a flying instructors course in July 1936 and joined the staff of N[MASK]. 1 FTS . He was promoted to flight lieutenant on 1 March 1937 . Commenci[MASK]g in[MASK]July 1938 , he was one of six students to take part in the RAAF 's first Long Specialist Navigation Course , run by Flight Lieutenants Bill Garing and Alister Murdoch at Point Cook . The course involved several epic training flights that attracted considerable media attention[MASK], including a twelve @-@ day , [MASK]0 @,@ 80[MASK] @-@ kilometre ( 6 @,@ [MASK]00 mi ) round @-@ A[MASK]stralia trip by three Avro Ansons , one of which was piloted by Headlam , in November . The [MASK]ollowing [MASK]onth , Headlam led the three Ansons on a six @-@ day journey back and forth over Central Australia . He subsequently passed the navigation cours[MASK] with a special distinction . On 27 January 1939 he was posted to[MASK]RAAF Station Laverton , Victoria , as a fl[MASK]ght commander . He served initially with No. 2 Squadron , before t[MASK]ansferring to No. 1 Squadron on 29 August . Both units operated Ansons . 
 
 = = World War II = = 
 
 Following the outbreak of World War II , No. 1 Squadron was engaged[MASK]in convoy escort and maritime reconnaissance duties off south @-@ eastern Aus[MASK]ralia . Headlam continued to serve with the squadron as a flight command[MASK]r until 15 January 1940 , when he was assigned to Headquarters Lavert[MASK]n as the station navigation officer . On 27 March he was posted to the staff o[MASK] RAAF Headquarters , Melbourne . He was promoted to squadron leader on 1 June 1940 . Two week[MASK] later he married Katherine Brid[MASK]e at S[MASK] Paul 's A[MASK]glican Church in Frankston ; the couple would have a son and a daughter . 
 Headlam was given command of No. 2 Squadron [MASK]t Laverton on 15 Apr[MASK]l 1941 , and raised to wi[MASK]g commander on 1 July . Equipped with Lockheed Hudsons , the squadron mainly conducted maritime patrols in southern waters until 5 December , when four of its aircraft were ordered to Darwin , Northern Territory , in response to fears of Japanese aggression in the Pacific . On 7 December , this detachment established itself[MASK]at Penfui , near Koepang in Dutch Timor[MASK], while No. [MASK] Squadron 's eight [MASK]emaining Hudsons were stationed at Darwin on standby . The following day , awa[MASK]e that Australia was now at war in the Pa[MASK]ific , one of the Penfui @-@ based Hudsons attacked the Japanese pearler Nanyo Maru , which was suspecte[MASK] of being a ra[MASK]io ship , and forced it aground . By 12 Dece[MASK]ber , Headlam had transferred to Penfui as commanding officer[MASK]of the base , as well as No. 2 Squad[MASK]on . 
 During January 1942 , No. 2 Squadron 's aircraft were dispersed at Penfui ,[MASK]Boeroe Island , and Darwin . The Penfui detachment attacked Japanese shipping ta[MASK]ing part in the i[MASK]vasion of Celebes . Two Hudsons s[MASK]ot down or damaged three Japanese floatplanes that att[MASK]cked them as they were bombing a transport ship on 11 January ; the next day b[MASK]th Hudsons were themselves shot do[MASK]n by Mitsubishi Zeros . Penfui was bombed by the Japanese for [MASK]he first time on 26 Janua[MASK]y 1942 , and attacked regularly thereafter , damaging some aircraft . The intact Hudsons were withdrawn to Darwin but Headlam and his staff remained at [MASK]enfui to enabl[MASK] the base to be used by aircraft during reconnaissance missions from Australia .[MASK]On 18 February , Headlam was ordered to evacuate all his personnel except a small party to demolish the airfield with assistance from Sparrow Force .[MASK]H[MASK] returned to Darwin the following day , just as the city experienced its first raid by the Japanese . Four of[MASK]No. [MASK] Squadron 's Hudsons were destr[MASK]yed in the attack ; the remainder were relocated to Daly Waters , where they continued to carry out reconnaissance and bomb[MASK]ng missions against Japanese targets in Timor . 
 Headlam r[MASK]ma[MASK]ned in Darwin as C[MASK]ntroller of Operations at Headquarters No[MASK]th @-@ Western Area Command until 12 Ma[MASK] 1942 ,[MASK]when he was posted to Nhill , Victoria , as commanding of[MASK]icer of No. 2 Air Navigation School , o[MASK]erating Ansons . N[MASK]. 97 ( Reserve ) Squadron was fo[MASK]med from the school 's personnel in June . On 20 July 1943 , Headlam took command of No. 2 Air O[MASK]server School ( AOS ) , also operating Ansons , at Mount Gambier , South Australia . He was promoted to group captain on 1 December 1943 [MASK] and was appointed the inaugural commanding officer of No. 3 AO[MASK] , operating Ansons and Fairey Battles out of Port Pirie , on 9 [MASK]ecember . After handing over command of No. 3 AOS , he co[MASK]menced studies at RAAF Staff School[MASK]in Mount Martha , Victo[MASK]ia , on 2 October 1944 . He was appoin[MASK]e[MASK] se[MASK]ior administrative staff officer at North @-@ Western Area Command on 12 [MASK]anuary 1945 .

 Headlam became Officer C[MASK]mmanding North @-@ Western Area in January 1946 . Posted to Britain at the end of the year , he at[MASK]ended the Royal Air Force Staff College , An[MASK]over , and served with RAAF Overseas Headquarters , London . On his[MASK]return to Australia , in November 1947 , he became Director of Training at RAAF Headquarters . In November 1950 , Headlam was appointe[MASK] [MASK]o take over command of No. 90 ( Composite ) Wing from Group Captain Paddy Heffernan . Headquartere[MASK] at RAF Changi , Singapore , No. [MASK]0 Wing controlled RAAF units operating during the Malayan Emergency : No. 1 ( Bomber ) Squadron , flying Avro Lincolns , and No. 38 ( Transport ) Squadron , flying Douglas C @-@ 47 Dakotas . Th[MASK] Lincolns conducted area bombing missio[MASK]s over communist @-@ held territory , as well as strikes against pinpoi[MASK]t targets . The Dakotas were tasked with courier flights , VI[MASK] transport and medical evacuations across South East As[MASK]a , and in Malaya wi[MASK]h airlifting troops and cargo , dropping supp[MASK]ies to friendly forces and despatching propaganda leaf[MASK]ets . Headlam was slightly[MASK]injured on 20 December , when a No. 38 Squadron Dakota he was [MASK]o @-@ piloting on a [MASK]upply drop crash @-@ landed at Kampong Aur in Pahang , following engine failure . In August 1951 he wa[MASK] named commander of RAF Tengah , Singapore , in addition to his post as commanding officer of No. 90 Wing . Headlam handed over command of No. 9[MASK] Wing in December 1951 . 
 On 19 February 1952 , Headlam became senior air s[MASK]aff officer ( SASO ) at Eastern Area Command in Penrith , New South Wales . During his term as SASO , the RA[MASK]F began re @-@ equipping with English El[MASK]ctric Canberra jet bombers and CAC [MASK]abre jet fighters . The Air Force also u[MASK]derwent a major organisational change , as it transitioned from a geographically based command @-@ and @-@ control system to one based on function , resulting in the establishm[MASK]nt of Home ( opera[MASK]ional ) , Training , and Maintenance Commands . E[MASK]stern Area Command , considered [MASK] de facto operational headquarters owing to the preponderance of combat units unde[MASK] it[MASK] co[MASK]trol ,[MASK]was reorganised as Home Command in October 1953 . Headlam was appointe[MASK] an Officer of the Order of the British Empire ( OBE ) in the 1954 New Year Honours for his " exceptional ability and d[MASK]votion to duty " . He was promoted to acting air commodore in May . [MASK]is appo[MASK]ntment as aide @-@ de @-@ camp to Queen Elizabeth II was announced on 7 October 1954 . 
 Headlam was promot[MASK]d to substantive air commod[MASK]re on 1 January 1955 . In November he was posted to RA[MASK]F Overseas Headquarters , London , and the foll[MASK]wing year undertook studies at the Imperial Defence College . Returning to Australia , he served [MASK]s acting Air Member for Personnel at the Department of Air[MASK], Canberra , from 19 March to 21 October [MASK]957 , between the terms of Air Vice Marshals Fred Scherger and Allan Wal[MASK]ers , and again from 24 [MASK]ugust 1959 to 28 March 1960 , betwee[MASK] the terms of Wal[MASK]ers and Air Vice M[MASK]rshal [MASK]ill Hely . In[MASK]this role Headlam occupied a seat on th[MASK] Air Board [MASK] the service '[MASK] controlling body that comprised its senior [MASK]fficers and was [MASK]haired by the Chief of the Air Staff . He was also on[MASK] of two RAAF repre[MASK]entatives to serve on a committee , chaired by businessman William John Allison , examining conditions of defence service ; the committee 's recommendat[MASK]ons led to a doubling of flight pay , among other improvements . Headlam 's oth[MASK]r positions at the Department of Air included Air Commodo[MASK]e Plans from October 1957 to January 1959 , a[MASK]d Director General Plans and Policy from January to August 1959 . The latter assig[MASK]ment put him in charge of the RAAF 's[MASK]Directorate of Intelligence . Headlam was appointed a Commander of the Order of the British E[MASK]pire ( CBE ) in the 1958 Queen 's Birthday Honours , gazetted on 3 June . In May 1960 he became ac[MASK]ing Deputy Chief of the Air Staff . 
 On 30 January 1961 , Headlam joined the staff of Operatio[MASK]al Command ( OPCOM ) , the successor organisation to Home Command , responsible for the direction of RAAF operational units . He took[MASK]over as Air Officer Commanding ( AOC ) OPCOM from Air Vice Marshal Val Hancock[MASK]in April . Headlam was promoted to air vi[MASK]e marshal on 29 May . On [MASK]7 July 1962 , he was posted to RAAF Base Butterworth[MASK], Malaya , and took up the appointment of AOC No. 224 Group RAF in Singapore one week later . He was succeeded as AOC OPCOM[MASK]by Air Vice Marshal Alister Murdoch . As AOC No. 224 Group , Headlam had overall respons[MASK]bilit[MASK] for [MASK]egional air defence and offensive air operatio[MASK]s du[MASK]ing the Brunei Rebellion in Dec[MASK]mber 1962 , and the subsequent Konfrontasi between Indonesia an[MASK] Malaysia that officially began the following month . Divorced from his first wife in 1956 , he married widowed social worker Vernon Spence at the Sydney [MASK]egistry office on 20 January 1964 . He handed over No. 224 Group to Air Vice Ma[MASK]shal Christopher Foxley @-@ Norris on 30 November . 
 Returning to Australia , Headlam became Deputy Chief of the Air Staff ( DCAS ) on 26 January 1965 . He was appointed a Companion of the Order of th[MASK] Bath ( CB ) " in recognition of disting[MASK]ished service in the Borneo Territories " on 22 June . His tenure as DCAS coincided with[MASK]the most significant rearmament program the Air Force had undertaken since World War II , and with [MASK]anpower shortages stemming from this expans[MASK]on and from Australia 's increasing involvement in the security of South East Asia . The first RAAF h[MASK]licopters we[MASK]e committed to the Vietnam War towards the end of his term , and he t[MASK]avelled [MASK]o Saigon with the Chief of the General Staff , Lieutenant General Sir[MASK]Jo[MASK]n Wilton , in March 1966 to plan the deployment[MASK]. The year before , Wilton had recommended [MASK]o Air [MASK]arshal Murdoch , the Chief of the Air Staff , that two Iroquois be sent to Vietnam for familiarisation purposes ; Murdoch had rebuffed Wi[MASK]ton , and the RAAF helicopter squadron was considered underprepared for its army co @-@ op[MASK]ration role wh[MASK]n it finally did deploy . Headlam succe[MASK]ded Air Vice Marshal Douglas Candy as AOC Support Command , Melbou[MASK]n[MASK] , on 8[MASK]August 1966 . Support Command had been formed in 1959 , by m[MASK]rging the RAAF 's former Training and Maint[MASK]nance Commands . On 1 January 1968 , Headlam was posted t[MASK] London as Head of the Australian Joint Services St[MASK]ff .

 The current M @-@ 82 dates back to 1926 . It ran from US 31 in[MASK]H[MASK]rt to the norther[MASK] junction o[MASK][MASK]US 131 and M @-@ 46[MASK]in Howard City . The highway was routed through Ferry , Hesperia and Fremont , replacing M @-@ 41 . I[MASK] late 1936 , M @-@ 46 [MASK][MASK]s extended along the section between Newaygo and Howard City , forming a M @-@ 46 / M @-@ 82 concurrency to fill a gap in the M @-@ 46 rou[MASK]ing . This concurrent s[MASK]ction became just M @-@ 46 in 1938 , [MASK]hortening M @-@ 82 back to the northern M @-@ 37 junction in Newaygo . The highway was moved to a new alignment west of Ferry in late 1947 or early 1948 .[MASK]Instead of headi[MASK]g northwesterly to Hart , it was continued west to end in Shelby . 
 Two realignments in 1963 and 1964 rerouted the western end of the highway again . This time it was realigned to run from Hesperia to New Era , bypassing Ferry . A larger change[MASK]aroun[MASK] 1969 reconfigured the highway designations in Oce[MASK]na County . M @-@ 20 replaced M @-@ 82 west of Hesperia ,[MASK]to end at New Era instead of Muskegon . The [MASK]ew M @-@ 120 designation replaced M @-@ 20 south of Hesperia . M @-@ 82 now ran from Hesperia to Newaygo only . The l[MASK]ngth of the highway was [MASK]ncreased in 1973 when[MASK]the eastern end was mo[MASK]ed back to Howard City . M @-@ 46 was rerouted to follow the US 131 freeway south of Howard City to Cedar Springs , and replac[MASK]d M @-@ 57 [MASK]etween Cedar Springs and Casnovia . This freed[MASK]up the Newaygo to Howard City highway for a return to the M @-@ 82 designation . The last change came in 1978 when the concurrency with M @-@ 120 was eliminated in favor of M @-[MASK] 120 [MASK] The M @-@ 82 designat[MASK]on was truncated at this time to[MASK]the junction west of Fremont , resulting in the current[MASK]highway routing .

 Shikamaru first major appearance in the series is [MASK]uring the Chunin Exams , bi @-@ y[MASK]arly exams for n[MASK]nja who wish to advance in rank . He is part of Team 10[MASK]alongside Choji Akimichi and Ino Yamana[MASK]a . He is a highly unenthusiastic person , and he attempts to go[MASK]through life with minimum effort . Contrary to his lazy tendencies , Shik[MASK]maru is extremely intelligent ; his teacher , Asuma Sarutobi , determined that Shikamaru 's [MASK]Q was over 200 . Shikamaru 's abilities are based on the Shadow Imitation Tec[MASK]nique ( 影真似の術 , Kagemane no Jutsu , English TV : " [MASK]hadow Possession Jutsu " ) , the sign[MASK]ture technique of his clan , with which he merges his shadow with an opponent 's shadow , making them immobi[MASK]ized and forced to mimic Sh[MASK]kamaru 's movements .

 S[MASK]ikamaru approaches the exams with a s[MASK]nse of apathy ; when he battles the S[MASK]nagakure ninja Temari , he defeats her but forfeits his match[MASK]to her , due t[MASK] his chakra being low . D[MASK]spite this loss , he is the only ninja among his [MASK]eers to be promoted to the rank of Chunin , as the overseers of the exa[MASK]s were impressed by the insi[MASK]ht and intelligence he demonstrated aga[MASK]nst Temari . As a Chunin , Shikamaru is appointed the[MASK]leader of a team[MASK]to prevent Sasuke Uchiha from defecting to t[MASK]e village of Otogakure . Although Shikamaru 's team manages to defeat the Otogakure ninja barring their way , Sasuke manages to escape .

 Meridian is the sixth largest city[MASK]in t[MASK]e state of Mississippi , in the United States . It is[MASK]the county seat of Lauderdale Coun[MASK]y an[MASK] the prin[MASK]ipal city of [MASK]he Meridian , Mississippi Micropolitan Statistical Area . Along major highways , the[MASK]city is 93 mi ( 150 km ) east o[MASK] Jackson , Mis[MASK]issippi ; 154 mi [MASK] 248 km ) west of Birmingham , Alabama ; 202 mi ( 325 km ) northeast of New Orleans , Louisiana ; and 231 mi ( 372 km ) southeast of Memphis , Tennessee . 
 Established in 1860 [MASK] at the intersection of the Mobile and Ohio Railroad and Southern Railway of Mississippi , Meridian 's economy was built on t[MASK]e railways and goods transported on them , and it became a strategic trading center . Du[MASK][MASK]ng the American Civil War , General William Tecumseh Sherman burned much of the city to the gro[MASK]nd in the Battle of Meridian ( February , 1864 ) . 
 Rebuilt after the war , t[MASK]e city ent[MASK]red a " Golden Ag[MASK] " it become the [MASK]argest city in [MASK]ississ[MASK]ppi bet[MASK][MASK]en[MASK]1890 and 1930 , and a leading center for manufacturing in the Sout[MASK] , with 44 trains arriving and departing daily . Union Station , built in 1906 , is now a multi @-@ modal center , giving access to the Merid[MASK]an Transit System , Greyhound Buses , and Trailways , averaging 242 @,@ 360 passengers per year . Although the economy slowed with the decline of the railroad industry , the city has diversified , with healthcare , military , and manufacturing employing the most people in 2010 . The population within the city limits , according to 2008 census estimates , is 38 @,@ 2[MASK]2 , but a pop[MASK]latio[MASK] of 232 @,@ 900 i[MASK] a 45 @-@ mile ( 72 km ) radius and 526 @,@ 500 in a 65 @-@ mile ( 105 km ) radius , of which 104 @,@ 600 and 234 @,@ 200 people respectively are in the labor force , feed the e[MASK]onomy of the city .

Rush Foundation Hospital is the largest non @-@ military employer in the region , employi[MASK]g 2 @,@ 610 people . 
 Among the city 's many arts organizations and historic buil[MASK]ings are the Riley Center , the Meridian Museum of Art , Meridian Little Theatre , and the Meridian Symphony Orchestra . Meridian was hom[MASK] to two Carnegie libraries , [MASK]ne fo[MASK] whites and one for African Americans .[MASK]The Carnegie Branch Library , now demolished , was one of a number of Carnegie libraries built for blacks in[MASK]the[MASK]Sou[MASK]her[MASK] United St[MASK]tes[MASK]during the segregation era . 
 The city has been selected as the future location of the Missis[MASK]ippi Arts and Entertainment Center ( MAEC ) .

 = = History = = 
 
 Previously inhabited by the Choctaw Native Americans , th[MASK] are[MASK] now called Meridian was ob[MASK]ained by the United States under th[MASK] terms of the Treaty of Dancing Rabbit Creek in 1830 during the period [MASK]f Indian Removal . After the tr[MASK]aty was ratified , European @-@ American s[MASK]ttlers b[MASK]gan to[MASK]move into the area . 
 After receiving a federal land grant of about 2 @,@ 000 acres ( 810 ha ) , Richard McLemore , the first settler of Meridian , began off[MASK]ring free land to new[MASK]omers to attract more settlers to the region and develop the area . Most of McLemore 's land was bought in 1853 by Lewis [MASK]. Ra[MASK]sdale , a lawyer from Alabama . John T. B[MASK]ll , a merchant from Kemper County ,[MASK]bought the re[MASK]aining 80 acres ( 0 @.@ 32 km2 ) . Ragsdale and Ball , now known as the [MASK]ou[MASK]ders of the city , began laying out lots for new de[MASK]elopment on their respective[MASK]land sections . 
 There was much competition over the proposed name of the [MASK]ettlement . Ball and th[MASK] more industrial residents of the city supported the[MASK]name " Meridian , " believing the term to[MASK]be synonymous with " junction " [MASK] the more agrarian residents of the city preferred " Sowashee " ( meaning [MASK] mad river "[MASK]in a Native American language ) , from the name of a nearby cr[MASK]ek ; and Ragsdale proposed " Ragsdale City . " Ball erected a station house on the Mobile and Ohio Railroad – the sign on which would alternate between " Meridian " and " Sowashee " each day . Eventually the continued development of the railroads led to an influx of railroad workers who overruled the others in the city and left " Meridian " on the station permanently . The town was officially incorporated as Meridian on Februa[MASK]y 10 , 1860 . 
 Meridian was a small village at the start[MASK]of the Ameri[MASK]an Civil War in 1861 . Its st[MASK]ategic position at the railroad junction l[MASK]d to[MASK]the Confederate construction of several military installations to support the[MASK]war . During t[MASK]e Battle of Meridian in [MASK]864 , Gene[MASK]al William Tecum[MASK]eh Sherma[MASK] [MASK]ed troops into the city , destroying the[MASK]railroads in every direction , as well[MASK]as an arsenal and immense sto[MASK]ehouse[MASK] ; his forces burned much of the buildings to the ground . Sherman is reported to have said afterw[MASK]rds , " Meridi[MASK]n , with its depots , store @-@ houses , ars[MASK]nal , hospitals , offices , hotels , and cantonments no longer exi[MASK]ts . " Despite the destruction , the railroad lines in the city were rapidly repaired , back in operation 26[MASK]working days after the battle . Race relations remained tense during the Reconstructio[MASK] era , with the riot of 1871 following a fire that damaged many businesses . 
 Th[MASK] town boomed in the aftermath of the Civ[MASK]l War , and experienced its " Golden Age " from 1880 to 1910 . The railroads in the area provided for a means of transportation and an influx of industries , which caused a population boom . As the population rose , commercial[MASK]activity increased in the downtown area . Between 1890 and 1930 , Meridian was the largest city in Mississippi and a[MASK]leading center for manufacturing in[MASK]the South . Many of the city 's[MASK]historic buildings were built during and just after this e[MASK]a , including the Grand Ope[MASK]a House in 1890 , the Wechsler School in 1894 , two Carnegie libraries in 1913 , a[MASK]d the Threefoot Building , Meridian 's tallest skyscrape[MASK] , in 1929 . 
 The [MASK]ity continued to grow thanks to a commission government 's efforts to bring in 90 new industrial plants in 1913 and a booming automobile industry in the 1920s . Even through the stock mark[MASK]t crash of 1929 and the following Great Depression , the city continued to attract new businesses[MASK]. With escapism becoming popular in the cult[MASK]re during the depth of the Depression , the S. H. Kress & Co[MASK] building , built to " p[MASK]ovide luxury to the common man , " op[MASK][MASK]ed in downtown Meridian , as did the[MASK]Temple Theater , which was used as a movie house . The fed[MASK]ral cour[MASK]house was built in 1933 as a WPA proje[MASK]t . 
 After[MASK]a brief slowdown of the economy at the end of t[MASK]e Depression , the country entered World War II , which renewed the importance of railroads . The rails were essential to transport gasoline and scrap metal to build military vehicles , so Meridian became the region 's rail center agai[MASK] . This re[MASK]ewed prosperity continued until the 1950s , when[MASK]the a[MASK]tomobile and Interstate Highway System became more popular than passenger rails . The decline of t[MASK]e railr[MASK]ad industry caused significant job losses , result[MASK]ng in a population decline as workers left for other areas . 
 During[MASK]the American Civil Rights Mov[MASK]ment in[MASK]the 1960s , Meridian was home[MASK]to a Council of Federated Organizations ( COFO ) off[MASK]ce and several[MASK]other activist organizations . James Chaney and other local residents , along wi[MASK]h Michael Schwerner [MASK] his wife Rita , [MASK]nd Andrew Goodman , volunteers from the North , worked to create a community center , holding class[MASK]s to help prepare African Americans in the area to regain the power to vote . Whites in[MASK]the area resented the activism[MASK], and racia[MASK] tension often resulted in violenc[MASK] . In June 1964 , Cha[MASK]ey , Schwerner , and Goodman went to Nesho[MASK]a County , Mississippi , to meet with members of a black church that had been bombed and burned . The three disappeared that night on their way back to Meridian . Fol[MASK]owing a massive FBI investigation , their murdered bodies were foun[MASK] two months later , buried i[MASK] an earthen dam . 
 S[MASK]ven Klansmen , including a deputy sheriff , were convicted in the federal courthouse in Meridian of " depriving the victims of their civil rights " and three were acquitted in the Mississippi civil rights workers murders trial . It wa[MASK] the first time that a w[MASK]ite jury had[MASK]convicted " a white official i[MASK] a civil rights killing . " In 2005 , the case was reopened by the state , which brought char[MASK]es in the case for the first time . Edgar Ray Killen was convicted of manslau[MASK]hter and sentenced to 60 years in prison . Meridian later honored Chaney by[MASK]renaming a portion of 49th[MASK]Avenue after him and holding an annual memorial service . 
 Starting in the 1960s and following the construction of highways that [MASK]ade commuting ea[MASK]ier , residents began to move away from downtown in favor of new housing subdivisions to the north . A[MASK]ter strip commercial interests be[MASK]an to move downtown , the ci[MASK]y worked to [MASK]esignat[MASK] severa[MASK] areas as historic districts in the 1970s and 80s[MASK]to preserve the architectural character of the city . The Meridian Historic Districts and Landmarks Commission was created in 1979 , and the Meridian Main Street program was founded in 1985 . 
 Meridian Main Street or[MASK]anized several projects to revitalize downtown , includ[MASK]ng the construction of a [MASK]ew Amtrak Station in 1997 based on the design of the[MASK]historic train station used during Meridian 's Golden Age ; it had been demolished . Other projec[MASK]s included th[MASK] renovation of the Ro[MASK]enbaum Building in 2001 and Weidmann 's Restaurant in 2002 , as well as support for integrated urban design . Meridian Main Street , along with The Riley Foun[MASK]ation , helped renovate and adapt the historic Grand Opera[MASK]House in 2006 for us[MASK] as the " Mississippi State Unive[MASK]sity Riley Center for Education a[MASK]d the Performing Arts . " 
 After ownersh[MASK]p of the Meri[MASK]ian Main Street was transferred to the Alliance for Downtown Meridia[MASK] in late 2007 , the two or[MASK]anizations , along with the Meridian Downtown Association , spearheaded the downtown revitalization [MASK]ffort [MASK] [MASK]he Alliance serves as an umbrella organization , allowing[MASK]the other two organizations to use the its support staff and housing , and in turn [MASK]he Alliance serve[MASK] as a[MASK]liaison between the organizations . Plans were underway to renovate the Threefoot Building , but newly elected Mayor Cheri Barry killed the plans in early [MASK]010 . Today , the Alliance helps to promote furth[MASK]r development and restoration downtown ; its goal is to assist businesses such as sp[MASK]ci[MASK]lt[MASK] shops , restaurants , and bars because these help downtown be[MASK]ome more active during the d[MASK]y and at night . The Meridian Downtown Association is primarily focused on i[MASK]creasing foot traffic downtown by organizing special events , and the Meridi[MASK]n Main Street program supports existing businesses downto[MASK]n . 
 
 = = = Hotels = = = 
 
 Given Meridian 's site as a railroad junction , its travelers have attracted the development of many hotels . Even before Meridian reached its " Golden Age , " several large hote[MASK]s , including the Great Southern and [MASK]he Grand A[MASK]enue hotels , were built before the start of the 20th century . With[MASK]the growth of the railroads and the construction of [MASK]he original Union Station in 1906 , many hotels were constructed fo[MASK] passengers and workers . The Elmira Hotel was constructed in 1905 , and the Terminal Hotel was const[MASK]ucted in 1910 . Hotel Meridian was constructed in 1907 , [MASK]nd Union Hotel was built in 1908 . Union [MASK]otel was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in [MASK]979 , and both Hotel Meridian and Grand Avenue Hotel were listed as contributing properties to[MASK]the Meridi[MASK]n Urban Center Historic District . 
 As the city [MASK]rew , the hotels reflected ambitions of the strong economy , as evidenced by the eleven @-@ story skyscraper Lamar Hotel built in 1927 . Listed on the National Register[MASK]of Historic Places in 1979 , the Lamar Hotel was adapted for use as a county annex building . In 1988 it [MASK]as listed as a Mississippi Landma[MASK]k . 
 The E.F. Young Hotel was built in 1931 . A [MASK]taple in the African @-@ American business district that developed west of the city 's core , the hotel[MASK]was one of the only pl[MASK]ces in the city during the years of segregation where a traveling African American could find a room . 
 As th[MASK] city suburbs developed in the 1960s and ' 70s , most hotels moved outside of downtown . Rehabili[MASK]ation of the Riley Center in 2006 has increased demand a[MASK]d a push for a new downtown hotel . The Threefoot Building[MASK]has been proposed for re[MASK]evelopment for this purpose , but restoration [MASK]fforts stalled with a[MASK]change in city administrations . The Threefoot Preservation Society was formed in 2013 to raise public awareness and support for the building 's renovation , featu[MASK]i[MASK]g to[MASK]rs of the first floor and anniversary events .

 The natural terrain of the area has been modified in the urban core of the city by grading , but it maintains its gentle rolling character in the outlying areas . Numerous small creeks are found throughout the city and small lakes and woodlands lie in the nor[MASK]hern and southern portions of t[MASK]e [MASK]ity[MASK]. Sowashee Creek run[MASK] [MASK]hrough the southern portio[MASK] of[MASK]the city and branches off into Gallagher 's Creek , which flows through the center of the city [MASK][MASK]Loper 's[MASK]Creek runs through the far @-@ [MASK]estern part of the city while smaller [MASK]reeks i[MASK]cluding Shearer 's Branch , Magnolia Creek , and Robbins Cre[MASK]k are disper[MASK]ed throughout the city .

The city was the largest in Mississ[MASK]ppi a[MASK]ound the start of the 20th centur[MASK] , with five maj[MASK]r rail lines and 44 t[MASK]ains coming in and out daily . The city 's economy not only depended on the rails but the goods , such as t[MASK]mber and cotton , transported on them . With thes[MASK] rail @-@ based industries , the city was a great economic power in t[MASK]e state and region from about 1890 throug[MASK] 1930 [MASK] Though its economy slowed with the decline of th[MASK] railroad[MASK]ng industry in the 1950s , the city has [MASK]dapted , moving from a lar[MASK]ely rail @-@ based economy to a more diversified one , with healthcare , military , and manufact[MASK]ring employing the most people[MASK].

 Known for more than a centu[MASK]y of arts , Meridian co[MASK]tains many art and cultur[MASK]l organizations and hosts many cultural events . One of the first art organizations in the city , Th[MASK] Meridian Art League , was established in February 1933 . Art[MASK]exhibitions were originally held in Lamar Hotel [MASK]n down[MASK]own Meridian , but[MASK]after a name change t[MASK] [MASK]eridian Art Association in 1949 , exhibitions were held at various locations around the[MASK]city . After the Carnegie library at 25th Ave and 7th St wa[MASK] closed , the Art Association remodelled the building into the Meridian Museum of Art to serve as a permanent home for exhibits . The museum was opened in 1970 and has since featured rotating exhibitions as well as many educational programs for both students and adults . Over thirty exhibitions are held annually , ranging from traditional decorative arts to ethnographic and tribal materials , photography , crafts , and many other works of art . The collection also includes 18th and[MASK]19th century portraits , 20th century [MASK]hotography , and several sculptures . 
 The Meridian Council for the Ar[MASK]s ( MCA )[MASK]was founded as [MASK]eridian 's and Laud[MASK]rdale County 's official arts agency in 19[MASK]8 . MCA operates its Comm[MASK][MASK]ity Art Grants program , the annual Threefoot Festival , several[MASK]workshops , and[MASK]other special[MASK]events each year . MCA is partne[MASK]ed with many arts organizations in the city and county in[MASK]l[MASK]ding the Meridian Museum of Art , the Meridian Littl[MASK] The[MASK]tre , an[MASK] the Meridian Symphony Orchest[MASK]a . Meridian Little Theatre , one of the South 's oldest subscription @-@ based community theatres , was built in 1932 and c[MASK]rrently provides entertainment t[MASK] residents of and visitors to Meridian and Lauderdale County , entertaining over 22 @,@ 000 guests each season , makin[MASK] it Mississippi 's most @-@ attended community theatre . The Meridian Symphony Orchestra ( MSO )[MASK]– founded in 1961 – pla[MASK]ed its first con[MASK]e[MASK]t [MASK]n 1962 and its first [MASK][MASK]ll season in 1963 . In 1965 the MSO booked its first international soloist , E[MASK]ena Nikolaidi , t[MASK] perform with the orchestra . The Orchestra helped the Meridian Public School District develop its own orchestra and strings programs and also helped develop the Meridian Symphony Chorus . The current conductor is Dr. Claire Fox Hillard , who has been with the orchestra since 1[MASK]91 . The MSO will celebrate its 50th anniversary in Februar[MASK][MASK]2011 with a performance from Itzhak Perlman . 
 The city[MASK]'s former[MASK]Gr[MASK]nd Opera House was built in 1889 by two half bro[MASK]hers , Israel Marks and Levi Rothenberg . During its operation t[MASK]e ope[MASK]a house hosted many famous artists and works , the [MASK]irst b[MASK]ing a German company 's rendition of Johann Strauss [MASK]I 's " The Gypsy Baron " . After closing in the late 1920s due to the Great Depression , the opera[MASK]house was abandoned for nearly 70 years . A $ 10 million grant in 2000 by the Riley Foundation , a local found[MASK]tion chartered in 1998 , sparked the building 's restoration while $ 15 milli[MASK]n came from a combination of city , county , and federal grants . The opera house 's renovation was completed in September 2006 under the new name " [MASK]ississippi State University Riley Center for Educa[MASK]ion and Performing Arts . " The Riley Center , which includes a 950 @-@ seat auditorium for live pe[MASK]formances , a 200 @-@ seat studi[MASK] theater , and 30 @,@ 000 sq [MASK][MASK] ( 2 @,@ 787 m2 ) of meeting space , attracts more than 60 @,@[MASK]000 visitors to downtown Meridian ann[MASK]ally[MASK]for[MASK]conferences , meetings , an[MASK] performances [MASK] 
 Meridian is rightly considere[MASK] an architectural tre[MASK]sure trove being one the nations most intact cities from the turn of[MASK]the last century . Architecture stud[MASK][MASK]ts from around the nation and Canada are known to visit Meridian in groups as part of their coursework due to numerous[MASK]structures in the city having been designed by n[MASK]ted architects . The only home in the US[MASK]south designed by noted Canadian born Ar[MASK]hitect L[MASK]uis S. Curtiss[MASK], famous for inventing the [MASK]lass curtain wall skyscraper , is extant on Highl[MASK]nd Park . The Frank Fort designed Threefoot Build[MASK]ng is gene[MASK]ally[MASK]considered one of the best Art Deco skyscrapers in the US and i[MASK] oft[MASK]n compared to Detroit 's famed Fisher Buil[MASK]ing . Noted California Architect Wal[MASK]ace Ne[MASK]f designed a number of ho[MASK]es in Meridian as well as in the Alabama Blac[MASK] Belt which adjoins the city across the nearby Alabama[MASK]State line . He had relatives in Meridi[MASK]n and Selma who were executives in the then thriving railroad industry and would take commissions in the [MASK]rea when commissions in California w[MASK]re lean . His work is mos[MASK]ly concentrated in the lower numbered blocks of Poplar Springs Drive where his 2516 Poplar Springs Drive is often compared to the similarly design[MASK]d Falcon Lair , th[MASK] Beverly Hills home in Benedic[MASK] Canyon of Rudolph Valentino . One Neff [MASK][MASK]rk was lost to an expansion of Anderso[MASK] Hospital in 1990 and another in Marion Park burned in the 1950[MASK] . The Meridian Post Office with its interior done entirely of bronze and [MASK]erde marble is also noteworthy as a very fine example of the type of Post Office struct[MASK][MASK]es built in thriving and well to do cities in the 1920s and originally had Lalique lighting which was removed sadly during a 1960s remodeling and which are now in private residences on Poplar [MASK]prings Drive a[MASK]d in North Hills . 
 Meridian has also been selected as the future[MASK]location of the Mississippi Arts and Entertainment Center ( MAEC ) . The Mississippi Legislature approved the idea i[MASK] 2001 a[MASK]d in 2006 promised $ 4 million in funding if private contributors could raise $ 8 million . The city donated $ 50 @,@ 000 to the cause in [MASK]eptember[MASK]2007 . The MAEC , as proposed , would be located on 175 acres ( 71 ha ) at Bon[MASK]ta Lakes and consist of an outdoor amphitheatre , an indoor concert hall , and a Hall of Fame honoring Mississippi artists . The Hall of Fame will be located downtown in the ol[MASK] Montana 's building . That property and the adjacent Meridian Hotel bu[MASK]lding were acquired in July 2010 for[MASK]$ 300 @,@ 000 . In Fe[MASK]ruary 2009 , the MAEC revealed its Walk of Fa[MASK]e outside of the Riley Center in an attempt to promo[MASK]e the pla[MASK]ned Hall of Fame . The first star on the walk was dedicated to Jimmie Rodgers , a Meridian nat[MASK]ve[MASK]. In September of the same year , [MASK]he second star was revealed , recognizing B.B. King , a famous blues musician from Mississippi . On June 1 , 2010 , authors Tennessee Williams , Eudora Welty , and William Faulkner were added to the walk . Sela Ward was added to the walk on June 24 , 2010 . The MAEC plans to add many more Mississippi @-@ bor[MASK] stars to the [MASK]alk of Fam[MASK] ; names mentioned[MASK][MASK]nclude Morgan Freeman , Jimmy Buffett , Elvis Presley , Conway Twitty , and others . 
 Another location in the city used for large productions is the Ham[MASK]sa Shrine Temple Theater . The Temple Theater houses a 778 @-@ pipe Robert Morgan organ , one o[MASK] two Theater [MASK]rgans still in t[MASK]eir original in[MASK]tallations in the state . With seating for 1800 p[MASK]rsons , the silent movie era was a prosperous time for the Temple . At the time , it was one of the largest stages in t[MASK]e United States , second only to the Rox[MASK] [MASK]heater in New York City . Today , seating 1576 [MASK]ersons ,[MASK]the Temple is used year @-@ round for area events , live stage shows , plays , concerts , H[MASK]masa Shrine functions , and public screenings of classic movies . 
 Highland Park houses a Jimmie Rodgers museum which displays the original guitar of " The Singing Brake[MASK][MASK]n " and other memorabilia of his[MASK]life and career , as well as rail[MASK]o[MASK]d equipment from the steam @-@ engine era . In addition to the museum building itself , there are outside memorials , and a vintage steam locomotive on display . A Mississippi Blues Trail hist[MASK]ric marker has been placed in Meridian to honor the city as the birthplace of Jimmie Rodgers and emphasiz[MASK]s his importance[MASK]to the development of the blues style of music in Missis[MASK]ippi [MASK] The city was the first site to receive this designation outside the Mississippi Delta .

 = = Education = = 
 
 Early public education in Meridian was based on the 1870 Mississip[MASK]i Constitution . From 1870 to 1885 , trustees appointed by the City Council served on the Board of School Directors , which had authority to operate the schools . Although there were sever[MASK]l schools in th[MASK] city b[MASK]fore 1884 , they were privately owned and on[MASK]y enrolled about 400 students . The city did not build its first publicly owned school until September 1884 . The first public school f[MASK]r blacks in the city was held in facilities rented from St. Pa[MASK]l Methodist C[MASK]u[MASK]ch . The Mississippi Legislature amended the city chart[MASK]r in January 1888 to allow the city to maintain its[MASK]own municipal school district , a[MASK]d in March[MASK]of the same year $ 30 @,@ 000 in bonds was approved for the city to bui[MASK]d new public schools . From this bond , the Wechsler School was built in 1894 , becoming the first brick public school building in the state built for blacks . 
 From this early district and later additions , the Meridian Public School District grew to its current [MASK]ize , which now includes six elementary schools , 3 middle schools , and 3 high schools [MASK] The city also contains [MASK]everal private schools including Lamar School , Calvary Christia[MASK] School , Co[MASK]m[MASK]nity Christian School , and St. Patrick 's Catholic School .[MASK]The campus of Meridi[MASK]n High School [MASK] the main high school in the district , occupies 37 acres ( 15 h[MASK] ) , including six buildings and 111 classrooms . The school is made up of grades 10 @-@ 12 and enrolls approximately 1 @,@ 500 students . 
 Meridian is home to two post @-@ secondary educational [MASK]nstitutions . Meridian Community College , founded in 1937 , is located at 910 Highway 19[MASK]N and offers free tuition for four semes[MASK]ers to graduates from the Meridian Public and Lauderdale County School Districts as well as homeschooled children who reside[MASK]inside Lauderdale County . Originally known as Meridian Junior College and located at Meridian [MASK]igh School , the colleg[MASK] moved to its present location in 1965 . Af[MASK]er[MASK]desegregation laws were passed , MJC merged wi[MASK]h T.J. Harris Junior College in 1970 [MASK] which had previously enrolled African @-@ American st[MASK]dents . The name change from Meridian Junior College to Meridian Community Co[MASK]lege took place In 1987 " to more accurately reflect the di[MASK]ersity of opportunities it pr[MASK]vides for a growing community area . " Missi[MASK]sippi State University also opera[MASK]es a campus in the city . As o[MASK] the Fall 20[MASK]8 semester , 763 students from 33 counties throughout the state and several in Alabama attended the college . 
 Meridi[MASK]n is served by the Me[MASK]idian @-@ Lauderdale County Public Library , loca[MASK]ed at the corner of 7th [MASK]treet and 26th Avenue . The city originally had tw[MASK] Carnegie libraries , both buil[MASK] in 1913 – one for blacks a[MASK]d one f[MASK]r whites . A group of women had formed the Fortnightly Book and Magazine Club in the 1880s and began raising money to build a library for the city . The[MASK]books they collected and share[MASK] within the club were later t[MASK]e basis of the library collection for Meridian .[MASK]With wide support for the library , the club enlisted Israel Marks , a city leader , to approach the national philanthr[MASK][MASK]ist Andrew[MASK]Carne[MASK]ie for funding[MASK][MASK]ssistance . The library for [MASK]lacks was built at 13th Street [MASK]nd 28th Avenue on land donated by St. Paul Methodist Church , and the lib[MASK]ary for whites was established in a building originally owned by members of the First Presbyteri[MASK]n Church of Meridian , who sold it to the city on Septembe[MASK] 25 , 1911 . The African American library was the onl[MASK] library for blacks in t[MASK]e state until after World War I and is the only Carnegie library ever built for African Ame[MASK]icans in the country . The two libraries served the city until [MASK]967 , when the institutions became integrated because of the Civil Rights Act [MASK]f 1964 , combined their collections , and moved al[MASK] materials to their[MASK]current location . The former white library was renov[MASK]ted and[MASK]converted into the Meridian Museum[MASK]of Art in 1970 , and the former African @-@ American library was demolis[MASK]ed on May 28 , 2008 .

 = Papa Stour = 
 
 Papa [MASK]tour is one of the Shetland Islands in Scotland , with a population of under twenty peopl[MASK][MASK], some of whom immigrated a[MASK]ter an appeal for residents in the 1970s . Located to the west of mainland Shetland[MASK]and with an area of 828 hectares ( 3 @.@ 2 square miles ) , Papa Stour is the eighth larg[MASK]st island in Shetland . Erosion of the soft volcanic rocks by the sea has created an extraordinary v[MASK]riety of caves , stacks , arches , blowholes , and cliffs . [MASK][MASK]e island and its surrounding seas harbour diverse populations of wildlife . The west side of the island is a Site of Special Sci[MASK]ntific Interest and the seas around the island are a Special Area of Con[MASK]ervation .[MASK]
 The isl[MASK]nd has several Neolithic burial chamber sites , as well as the remains of Duke Hakon 's 13th @-@ century house dating from the Norse occupati[MASK]n of the island . The population reached 380 or more in the nineteenth century , when a fis[MASK]i[MASK]g station was opened at Crabbaberry in West Voe . Subsequently there was a steady decl[MASK]ne in population , although the numbers have increased from a low of 16 in the 1970s . 
 Today the main settlement on th[MASK] island is Biggings , just to the east of which is Housa Voe from where the Snolda ferr[MASK] arrives from its ba[MASK]e[MASK]at West Burrafirth on the Shetlan[MASK] Mainland . Crofting , especially she[MASK]p rearing , is the mainstay [MASK]f island life . 
 N[MASK]merous shipwrecks have occ[MASK]rred around the coast , and the celebrated [MASK]oem Da Sang o da Papa Men by V[MASK]galand recalls the drama of t[MASK]e days when Papa Stour was a centre for deep @-@ sea fishing . 
 
 = = Geography [MASK] = 
 
 Papa Stour is located at the sou[MASK]h western end of St Magnus Bay . There [MASK]re 34 k[MASK]lometres ( 21 mi ) of rugged coastline which is in[MASK]ented by numerous small embayments and four larger ' voes ' . Hamna Voe ( Old Norse : ' harbour ba[MASK] ' ) in the south is the most[MASK]sheltered anchorage and the surrounding cliffs contain a natural rock arch . Housa Voe to the east ( Old Norse : ' house ba[MASK] ' ) is less secluded but is the main harbour for the island and the ferry 's [MASK]mbarkation point . 
 Brei Holm and[MASK]Maiden Stack guard the harbour entrance to[MASK]the south . The former is a tidal island a[MASK]d was a leper colony until the 18th century ( although it has been suggested that many of the " lepers " there were suffering from a vitamin deficiency rather [MASK]han leprosy ) . The latter 's name rela[MASK]es to a[MASK]story from the 14th century . Lord Thorvald Thoresson is said to have constructed the tiny house at its top , whose ruins are still visible , in order to " preserve " his daughter from men . Unfortunately for his plans , when she left she was found to be preg[MASK]ant ; in another version of the story , she and her fisherman sweetheart successfully eloped . West Voe , t[MASK]e inner part of which[MASK]is called ' Robies Nous[MASK] ' is the main voe in the north coast , the[MASK]smaller Cu[MASK]la Voe lying immediately to the west . 
 The main settlement on the island today[MASK]is [MASK]ig[MASK]ings , which overlooks Housa Voe and is surrounded by in @-@[MASK]bye land to the east of the hill dyke [MASK] which runs south from West Voe ) . To the west the island is bisected by a belt of glacial moraine about one and a half kilometres in length . Much of the rest of the area consists of a shallow stony soil that may be derive[MASK] from gl[MASK]cial till . There is an almost[MASK]complete absence of peat on the island and [MASK]ue to the volcanic rocks the soils are relatively fertile . The lack of peat led [MASK]o ' turf scalping ' for[MASK]fuel and the bare areas of rock in [MASK]he[MASK][MASK]nterior . 
 The h[MASK]ghest point on the island is in the north west at Virda Field [MASK] which rises to 87 [MASK]etres ( 285 feet ) . Virda is possibly from the Old Norse for ' heap of stones ' .

On the basis of a marriage arrangement between King Ch[MASK]istian of Norway and King James III of Scotland that d[MASK]tes to 1468 , Hill argued that the i[MASK]land should be considered a British crown dependency , and thus not a part of the United Kingdom or of the European Union .

 The island [MASK]s c[MASK]mpo[MASK]ed of a variety of volcanic and sedimentary rock [MASK]o[MASK]mations from the Devonian period . At that time the Scottish landmas[MASK] formed part of the Old Red Sandstone Continent and lay [MASK]ome 10 @-@ 25 degrees south of the equator . The accumul[MASK]t[MASK]ons of Old Red Sandstone , laid down from 408[MASK]to 370 million years ago , were creat[MASK]d as earlier Silurian [MASK]ocks , uplifted by th[MASK] formation of Pangaea , eroded and then were depo[MASK]ited into river deltas . The freshwater Lake Orcadie existed on the edges of the ero[MASK]ing mountains , stret[MASK]hing from Shetland to the southern Moray Firth . The str[MASK]cture of Papa Stour is largely made up of ashes and la[MASK]as from vol[MASK]ani[MASK] activity associated with this period , including ban[MASK]s of solidified volcanic ash and lava ( rhyolite ) , but there is also a Devonia[MASK] fish bed at Lamba Bank[MASK] . There are numerous large boulders deposited by Plei[MASK]tocene glaciation . 
 E[MASK]osion of the soft volcanic rocks by[MASK]the sea ha[MASK] created an extraordinary variety of caves , stacks , arches [MASK] blowholes , cliffs , voes and geo[MASK] that are amongst the finest in Britain .[MASK]The ' Holl o Boardie ' is a cave that passes right through the[MASK]north @-@ west tip of the island . It is nearly half a mile long and wide enough to row through . Kirstan ( or Christie 's ) Hole in the sou[MASK]h west is another spectacu[MASK]ar cave , part of the roof of which collapsed in 1981 . Yet anot[MASK]er is ' Francie 's Hole ' close to Hamna Voe in the west . This was the [MASK]avourite of John Tudor who wrote of the island in his Victorian memoirs and described the cave as : 
 ... in fairyland , so exquisite is the colouring of the roof and sides and so pellucid is the water ... [ w[MASK]th ] al[MASK]oves or recesses like stal[MASK]s in [MASK] church . 
 In 1953 the spectacular headland , [MASK] Da Horn o Papa ' fell into the sea during a storm . The nearby islet of Brei [MASK]olm also h[MASK]s caves that can[MASK]be accessed by sma[MASK]l boats when conditions permit .

 Human settlement of the island dates from circa 3000 BC and there are [MASK]emains of several Neolithic burial chambers known as ' heel @-@ shaped cairns ' . L[MASK]ttle is known of the pre @-@ Celtic and Celtic eras , but when the Norse arrive[MASK] it is likely they found a religious settlement as the name of the island derives from Papey S[MASK]ó[MASK]a meaning " Big is[MASK]and of the Papar " ( Celtic monks ) , in distinction to Papa Little some 12 kilomet[MASK]es ( 7 @.@ 5 mi ) to the west [MASK]

 Papa Stour is the subject of a 1299 manusc[MASK]ipt written in Old [MASK]orse , which is the oldest[MASK]surviving documen[MASK] from Shetland . It [MASK]eals[MASK]with a dramatic incident i[MASK] the house of Duke Hakon Magnusson , who was later to become King Hakon V of Norway . There is a circle of sto[MASK]es near the beach at Housa Voe , which are the remains of a ' ting ' , or local assembly . This was the scene of a duel , fought and won by Lord Thorvald Thoresson , who w[MASK]s accused of corrup[MASK]ion [MASK]n the 129[MASK] document and was later called ‘ dominus de Papay ’ . ( The story[MASK]of his unfortunate[MASK]daughter is referred to abov[MASK] . ) The remains of Duke Hakon 's thirteenth @-@ century hou[MASK]e [MASK]re still visible ne[MASK]r Housa Voe .

 In 1469 Shetland c[MASK]me under nominal Scottish control , although t[MASK]e Norse ' Lairds of Norway ' kept their Papa Stour e[MASK]tat[MASK]s until the 17th century . In the[MASK]16th century merchants from Bremen and Hamburg were operating a summer trading booth to buy fis[MASK] from the local fleet . By the 18th century , two Scottish lairds , Thomas Gifford of Busta , [MASK]nd Arthur Nicolson of Lerwick , owned the island . They maintained a prosperous Haaf ( Old Norse : ' deep sea ' ) fishing industry , undertaken in the summer months using six @-@ oared boats known as sixareens . [MASK] In addition [MASK]o the leper colony on Brei Holm there may have been another at Hilla Fielle overlooking Ha[MASK]na [MASK]oe . A recent ar[MASK]haeological survey was incon[MASK]lusive but suggests [MASK]he site may be much older than the supposed 18th century colony . 
 The island church , which overlooks Kirk Sand in the bay of Fore Wick , was founded in 1806 .[MASK]300 me[MASK]res from the p[MASK]esent church there may be an older[MASK]chapel site [MASK]f Sneeans or Snøyans [MASK]n the headland between the west end of Kirk Sand and the bay of Tusselby . It is called the ' ald kirk ' by local[MASK] an[MASK] referred to by the Ordnance Survey as " the site of a Romish chapel belong[MASK]ng to abo[MASK]t the twelfth century " . There is a tradition [MASK]hat the work there was interfered [MASK]ith [MASK]y supernatural powers and th[MASK]t each day 's work on the buildin[MASK] was destroyed during th[MASK] night . Eventually the cornerstones were moved over[MASK]ight by these unea[MASK]thly agencies to the[MASK]present site of the church and work was re @-@ commenced there successfully . Ex[MASK]avations in 2[MASK]04 found little besides large blocks of rhyolite and a piece of wha[MASK]ebone rib , suggesting that the oral tradition may ha[MASK]e some truth to it . 
 In the 19th ce[MASK]tury the Crabbaberry fi[MASK]hing station in West Voe was opened and the island[MASK]had a population of 360 p[MASK]ople or more . However , fuel shortages and a decline in fishing due to the introduction of steam drifters saw a fall in population fr[MASK]m the 1870s on . At this time another duel entered the history of Papa Stour [MASK] Edwin Lindsay , an Indian army officer and the son of the 6th Earl of Balcarres [MASK] was declared insane and sent to the island in disgrace after refusing to fight in one . He spent[MASK]26 years as a prisoner before the Quaker preacher Catherine Watson arranged for his rele[MASK]se in 1835 . Lindsay 's Well is a spring [MASK]t the south of the island wh[MASK]re he was allowed to bathe . 
 There are good exampl[MASK]s of horizontal water m[MASK]lls , a[MASK]so[MASK]known as Norse or Clack Mills , around Du[MASK]ch L[MASK]ch . Originally [MASK]hese were two stor[MASK] bui[MASK]dings with turf roof[MASK] , built into banks to give acc[MASK]ss to the upper floor where the mill @-@ stone was sited . Inside the building there was a fixed lowe[MASK] millstone , and a rotating upper millstone driven by the water falling onto the pad[MASK]les below .[MASK]Some were still in use on Papa Stour in the early years [MASK]f the 20th century , and[MASK]there is still a working example of one of these mills on the Burn of Clumlie , at Troswick in the south Mai[MASK]land of Shetland .

 In common with many sma[MASK]l Scottish islands , Papa Stour 's population peaked in the 19th century and has experienced a significant decline since then ( see e.g. Mingulay ) . By 1970 the island school had closed and the [MASK]opulation had declined to sixteen ' fairly[MASK]elderly ' residents , but an advertisement [MASK]n Exchange and Mart reversed the decline . A croft and [MASK][MASK]ve sheep were offered free of charge to[MASK]incomers which brought a flood of a[MASK]plic[MASK]nts . By 1981 t[MASK]e census recorded a population of 33 . However , by 2005 the population had fallen to 20 after serious discord b[MASK]tween islanders[MASK]led to several court cases . A number of people left the island and[MASK]the school[MASK]closed . By early 2008 the population had dropped to just nine after a family of seven l[MASK]ft .[MASK]The 2011 census recorded a usually resident population of 15 - during the decade 2011 @-@ 11 Scottish island populations as a whole grew by 4 % to 103 @,@ 702 .

 Th[MASK] coasts around Papa Stour have claimed numerous w[MASK]ecks . In Hamnavoe , Tiptan[MASK] Skerry alone has sunk Dutch , French , German and[MASK]Norwegian ships . 
 The Aberde[MASK]n trawler Ben Doran A178 , foundered on the Ve Skerries 3 mi[MASK]es northwest of Papa Stour , on the evening of 28 March 1930 while on her way to the village of Scalloway to land her catch . When she grounded weather[MASK]conditions were[MASK]fairly good but it was not until the followin[MASK] day that a passing [MASK]rawler saw , and reported the wreck . By the time that various rescue attempts were launched b[MASK] the coastguard and local voluntee[MASK]s ( there being no lifeboat in Shetland at [MASK]hat time ) , weather conditions had deteriorated to the point where it was imposs[MASK]ble to approach the skerries . A request had been made for the Stromness [MASK]ifeboat from Orkney , only 12[MASK] mil[MASK]s[MASK]away , to launch , but the [MASK]equest was made too late to be of help . All 9 crew perished in the wreck . Only 3 bodi[MASK]s were recovered , that of James Mitchell , which was returned to Aberdeen , and the bodies of J. Cormack an[MASK] J.R. Insh , which were buried in Scalloway . [MASK] The cargo ship SS Highcliffe ran aground in fog on Forewick Holm in February 1940 . On this occasion the conditions were clement and only the ship a[MASK]d cargo were lost[MASK]. In 1967 the Aberdeen trawler Juniper ran [MASK]ground in Lyra Sound[MASK]at the bottom of the 60 metres ( 200 feet ) cliffs . The 12 man crew were rescued by the Aith lifeboat , the coxswain being awarded the RNL[MASK] silver medal for this rescue . 
 Papa Stour 's most re[MASK]en[MASK] shipwreck occurred on 9 December 1977 when th[MASK] Aberdeen trawler Elinor Viking A278 , skipper Alec Flett [MASK] foundered on the Ve Skerries . The Aith Lifeboa[MASK] came to the s[MASK]ene but was unable to[MASK]g[MASK]t near enough to rescue the crew [MASK]ec[MASK]u[MASK]e of the sea c[MASK]nditions . At the request of Alec Webster , Coastguard Station Officer , Lerwick ,[MASK]a volunteer crew in a British Airways Sikorsky S61N helicopter from Sumbu[MASK]gh Airport was s[MASK]rambled . They managed to winch all the boat 's crew to safety within hours of the grounding , despite the storm force winds . The helicopter cre[MASK] later received a number of awards for bravery . There was no loss of life , but this incident prompted the building of a lighthouse on [MASK]he skerries in 1979 , a[MASK]d may also have been[MASK]the example required [MASK]or the formation of the pr[MASK]sent Search and Rescue[MASK]helicopter unit , based at Sumburgh Airport .

The Papa Stour Project is a Christian supported housing service offering accommodation to men with drug and alcoho[MASK] issues . Ferr[MASK]es now sail[MASK]across the [MASK]ound of Pa[MASK]a to West Burrafirth on the Shetland Mainland . The crossi[MASK]g takes 45 minutes , and although[MASK][MASK]he Snolda carries cars [MASK] there is only one short road on the island.For visiting ya[MASK]hts the four main voes provide good shelter , but the strong tid[MASK]s in both the Sound of Papa [MASK]nd to the north west require [MASK]onside[MASK]able care .

 The Papa Stour sword dance may be of Norse origin and bears[MASK]simil[MASK]rities to the long sword dance of [MASK]he n[MASK]rth east [MASK]f England . A description of the dance appears in The Pi[MASK]ate by Sir Walter Scott . 
 The write[MASK] and journalist John Sands lived o[MASK] Papa Stour and Foula for a while during the late nineteenth century . The writer , folklorist and musician , George P.[MASK]S. Peterson was brought up on Papa Stour . 
 It is also the ' Papa ' of Vagaland[MASK]'s poem Da Sang o da Papa men , no[MASK] adopted as part of the folksong tradition , as set to music by T.M.Y. Manson[MASK]. Th[MASK] insistent chorus chant , ' Rowin Foula Doon ! ' , is particularly striking . 
 " Oot bew[MASK]st da Horn o Papa ,

 " Rowin Foula doo[MASK] ! " refers to the fishermens ' practice of rowing their open fishing boat out to sea until the high clif[MASK]s of Foula were no longer visible . This entaile[MASK] the boat be[MASK]ng some 96[MASK]kilometres ( 60 mi ) west of Papa Stour . The ' tide @-@ lumps ' are increased swells of unusual size due to the c[MASK]mbined action of wind against tide . The res[MASK]nant final image of the piece is of the fishermen being led back home [MASK]o Papa by the ' scent o flooers ' across the water . This is an example o[MASK] Va[MASK]aland 's ability to create a vivid sensual impression of a situatio[MASK] . An extra layer of meaning [MASK]s added by the knowledge that Da Horn o Papa collapsed in a storm around the time [MASK]f this poem 's composition , so that it is a tribute not just t[MASK] a lost way of life , but a noted geographical fea[MASK]ure . 
 
 
 = Angel of Death ( Slayer song ) = 
 
 " Angel of Death " is the opening track on the Am[MASK]rican thrash metal band Slayer 's 1986 album Reign in Blood . The lyrics[MASK]and music were written by Slayer guitarist , Jeff Hanneman and a[MASK]e based on Nazi physician Josef M[MASK]ngele , who conducted human experiments at the Auschwitz concentration camp during World War II . " Angel of Death " led to the band facing accusations of Nazi sympathizing and racism throughout their career . 
 Desp[MASK]te th[MASK] con[MASK]rove[MASK]sy surrounding the song and its contribution to the delay in the release of Reig[MASK] in Blood , " Angel of Death " is featured on all of Slayer 's live albums and DVDs and has appeared in several movies . The song was well received [MASK]y critics ; Steve Huey of AllMusic de[MASK]cribed it as a " classic " . 
[MASK]
 = = Composition and origins = = 
 
 Slayer guitarist Jeff Hanneman wrote " Angel of Death " [MASK]fter reading[MASK]books [MASK]bout Nazi physician Josef Mengele while on tour with the band : " I remember stopping someplace where I bought two books on M[MASK]ngele . I thought , ' This has gotta be some sick[MASK]shit . ' So when it came time to do the record , that stuff was still in my head — that 's where the lyrics to ' Angel of Death ' came from . "[MASK]
 The lyrics detail Menge[MASK]e 's surgical e[MASK]periments on patients at the Auschwitz concentration camp during World War II . Mengele 's explorations were conducted on such groups as dwarfs and twins , and included[MASK]both physical and psyc[MASK][MASK]logical e[MASK]am[MASK]natio[MASK]s . Among the tests he performed that are mention[MASK]d in " Angel of Death " are experimental surgeries[MASK]performed without anesthesia , transfusion of blood between twins , isolation endurance , gassing [MASK] injecti[MASK]ns with lethal germs , sex change operations , the removal of organs and limbs , and [MASK]bacination . 
 " Sewn together ,[MASK]joining heads . Just a matter of time ' til you rip yourselves apart " , a line from the penultimate verse , is a reference to the allegation Mengele stitched together twins , one o[MASK] t[MASK]em deformed ; " the hunchback was sewn to the other child , back to ba[MASK]k , their wrists back to bac[MASK] too . " This claim was first made by Auschwitz sur[MASK]i[MASK]or V[MASK]ra Alexan[MASK]er at the 1961 trial of SS @-@ Hauptscharführer Adolf Eichmann the " ar[MASK]hitect of the Holocaust " , where it was asserted that Mengele [MASK] sewed the v[MASK]ins to[MASK]e[MASK]her " and turned " them i[MASK]to Siamese twins . " This allegation became more widely known when Vera Alexander[MASK]was featured in the 1985 documentary The Search for Mengele , which has been cited by several authors incl[MASK]ding Gerald P[MASK]sner , an expert on Mengele . 
 Towards the end of [MASK]he song , there is a line " Feeding off the screams of the mutants he 's creating " , which was taken from the film Th[MASK] Boys from Braz[MASK]l in which Dr. Mengele was the villain [MASK] 
 
[MASK]= = Controversy = = 
 
 [MASK]he lyrical content of " Angel of Death " contributed to the delay of the release of Slayer 's 1986 album Reign in Blood . The band were sign[MASK]d to Def Jam [MASK]ecords whose dis[MASK]ributor , Columbia Records , refused to release the album due to lyrical themes and artwork concerns , deeming the artwork " too graphic " . Reign in Blood was eventually distributed by Geffen Records on October 7 , 1986 . Howev[MASK]r , due to the controversy , Reign in Blood did not appear on Geffe[MASK] Records official release schedule . 
 " Angel of Death " caused outrage among survivors of the Holocaust , as well as the[MASK]r famil[MASK]es and the general public[MASK]. The co[MASK]troversy led to a[MASK]cusations [MASK]f[MASK]Naz[MASK] sympathizing which have followed Slayer throughout their car[MASK]er . People took Hanneman 's interest i[MASK][MASK]Nazi history and his collection[MASK]of Nazi medals as evidence of sympathizing – his most prized item [MASK]eing a German Knight 's Cross . Hanneman counteracted asserting : 
 " I know why people misinterp[MASK]et it – it 's be[MASK]ause they get this knee – jerk reaction to it . W[MASK]en they read the lyrics , there 's nothin[MASK] I put in the lyrics that says necessarily he was a bad man , because to me – well , isn 't that obvious ? I shouldn 't have[MASK]to tell you that . " 
 According to guitarist Kerry King : " Yeah , ' Slayer are Nazis , fasc[MASK]sts , communists ' — all that fun shit . And of course we got the most flak for it in Ger[MASK]any . I w[MASK]s always [MASK]ike , ' Read the lyrics and tell me what 's offensive about it . Can you see it as a documentary , or do you thi[MASK]k Slayer 's preachin[MASK] fucking Wor[MASK][MASK] War II ? ' Peop[MASK]e get this thought in their heads — especially in Europe — and you[MASK]'ll never talk them out of it . " 
 [MASK]he song drew [MASK]ccusations of racism , which the band has denied . [MASK]he band members are often asked about the accusations in interviews , and h[MASK]ve stated numerous times that they do not condone racism an[MASK] are merely interested in the subject . 
 In 2006 , the song " Jihad " from Slayer 's 2006 album Christ Illusion drew comparison to " Angel of Death " . " Jiha[MASK] " deals with the September 11 , 2001 , attacks[MASK], and tells the story from a terro[MASK]ist 's perspective . Vocalist Araya was expecting the subject matter to create a similar backlash to that of " Angel of Death " , a[MASK]though it did not m[MASK]te[MASK]ialise , in part , he believes ,[MASK]due to peoples ' view t[MASK]at the song is " just Slaye[MASK] being Slayer " .

 " Angel of Death " is the longest [MASK]rack on the album Rei[MASK]n in Blood , spanning 4 minutes a[MASK]d 51 seconds , where the to[MASK]al duration of the album is 29 minutes . Additionally , it[MASK]has one of the most conventional song structures on th[MASK] album , featu[MASK]ing prominent verses and choruses , where most tracks on the album eschew them . Hanneman and King deliver their ' intricate riffs ' , which offer the few hints of me[MASK]ody on the album according to PopMatters reviewer Adrien Begrand , a[MASK]d Araya bursts out his piercing scream , with Lombardo performing beats of 210 beats per minute . 
 When drummer Lombardo left Slayer[MASK]in 1992 , the band hired a full [MASK]-@ time replac[MASK]ment in Forbi[MASK]den drummer P[MASK]ul Bostaph . Bostaph made one mistake out o[MASK] the nine songs the band trialled him with , on " Angel of Death " . B[MASK]fore the " big double bass part " there is a lead section , whi[MASK]h Bostaph could not understand [MASK] as he had to learn from live records recorded with Lombardo .

 Although " Angel of Death " did not enter any charts , it received strong praise from critics in reviews for Reign in Blo[MASK]d .

Lyrically outlining the horrors to come , while musically laying the groundwo[MASK]k[MASK]for the rest of the record : fast , le[MASK]n and filthy . " 
 Adrien Begrand of PopMatters remarked that " There '[MASK] no better song to kick things off than the masterful [MASK] Ange[MASK] of Death ' , one o[MASK] the most monumental songs in[MASK]metal history , where guitarists Kerry King and Jeff [MASK]anneman deliver [MASK]h[MASK]ir intricate riffs , d[MASK]ummer Dave Lombardo performs some o[MASK] [MASK]he most powerful drumming ever recorded , and bassist / vocalist Tom Araya screams and snarls his tale[MASK]of Nazi war crimi[MASK]al Josef Mengele .

 Capitalizing on the publicity generated by the controv[MASK]r[MASK]y , the b[MASK]nd utilized Nazi [MASK]magery by a[MASK]apting a logo to one similar to the eagle atop swastika , during th[MASK] Seasons in the Abyss period .

H[MASK] quickly became a key player on the team , including rushing for 185 yards and four touchdowns while adding 10 defensive tackles in the[MASK]Grade 8 provincial semi @-@ finals on November 24 against the Hand[MASK]worth R[MASK]yals . For [MASK]hat perf[MASK]rmance , he was named " Star of the Week " by The Vancouver [MASK]un . The Knights went on to defeat [MASK][MASK]e Vancouver College Fighting Irish 48 – 0 in the Grade 8 B.C. championship gam[MASK] , where McC[MASK]rty scored anoth[MASK]r three to[MASK]chdowns . 
 The following year , McCarty joined th[MASK] senior team at St. Thomas More , [MASK]kipping the junior team entirely . He continued in his role as a running back while switching to the secondary defensively . Despite being a rare Grad[MASK] 9 player on the senior team , he was one of the Knights ' two leading rushers that year . McCarty scored a touchdow[MASK] in the[MASK]AAA B.C. championship game , helping the Knights win thei[MASK] firs[MASK] senior title as they bea[MASK][MASK]the Pinetree T @-@[MASK]Wolves 29 – 6 . While K.C.

 In 2000 , McCarty played a signif[MASK]cant role in the Knights ' rushing and return game . He rushed for 150 yards and three touchdowns against the Burnaby Central Wildcats in t[MASK]e annual Burnaby Bowl [MASK] adding two punt returns f[MASK]r touchdowns . By the end of October , the K[MASK]ights had compiled a perfect 6 – 0 rec[MASK]rd , and defensive coordinator and[MASK]former CFL defensive back Lou Deslauriers called McC[MASK]rty " the best player for his age and[MASK]talent that we 've ever had at our schoo[MASK] " . He [MASK]ecorded 238 yards and fo[MASK]r consecutive touchdowns with only 23 carries in the Knight[MASK] ' 46 – 12 victory [MASK]ver the W. J. Mouat Hawks in the[MASK]AAA championship game . For his [MASK]ole in earning t[MASK]e Knights their second AAA title , M[MASK]Carty was named the game 's MVP , bec[MASK]ming the youngest player to earn this award . 
 McCarty remained a presence on the field for the Knights in 2001 , expanding[MASK]his role by playing some snaps as a fullback . He rushed for 160 yards in that ye[MASK]r 's Burna[MASK]y Bowl , including three touchdowns[MASK]as a halfback and one as a fullback . McCarty had another notable performance in a 67 – 7 blowout against the South Delta Sun Devils , running for 200 yards and three touchdowns . He also showed himself to be a capable receiver , including making five catches for[MASK]66 yard[MASK] in a matc[MASK] against the Holy Cross Crusaders .

 On June 16 , 2011 , a [MASK]rough situated off the southern coast of Guatemala showed signs of possible tropical cyclogenesis .

 " The Bourgeois Blues " is a blues song by American folk and blues musician , Lead [MASK]elly [MASK] It was wri[MASK]ten in June 1937 in response to the discrimination and segregation that Lead Bel[MASK]y faced during a visit to Washington , DC to record for Alan Lomax . It rails against racism , the Jim Crow laws , and the condition[MASK] of contemporary African Ameri[MASK]ans in the sou[MASK]hern United [MASK]tates . 
 The song was recorded in December 1938 for the Library of Congre[MASK]s and re @-@ recorded in 1939 for commercial[MASK]release . It has been remi[MASK]ed and covered by a number of artists including P[MASK]te Seeger[MASK], Ry Cooder , Hans Theessink , and Billy Bragg . 
 " The Bourgeois Blues " is rega[MASK]ded as one of Lead Belly 's best origin[MASK]l works , but it also drew controversy . There is doubt over the song 's authorship , with some schol[MASK]rs contending that Lead Belly was unlikely to have written a work in a genre[MASK]new to him wit[MASK]out a[MASK]collaborator .

 Most music historians [MASK]ate the w[MASK]iting of " The Bourg[MASK]ois Blues " to L[MASK]ad Belly 's June 1937 trip to Washington , DC , when he was invited by the folklorist Alan Lomax to record for the Library of Congress 's folk music [MASK]ollection . On the first night Lead Be[MASK]ly and h[MASK]s wife Martha spent in the city , they encounte[MASK]ed racially discriminatory Jim Crow laws similar to those found in their native L[MASK]uisiana : most hotel[MASK] refused to rent [MASK]ooms to African Americans and the few that would [MASK]ere [MASK]ither full or refused to serve him because he was with a white man ( Lomax ) . Lomax , in some versions of the story described as an u[MASK]named "[MASK]white friend " , offered to let the couple stay for the night in his apa[MASK]tment near the Supreme Court Building . The next morning , Lead Belly awoke to Lomax[MASK]arguing with his landlord about the presence of[MASK]a black man , with the landlord threatening to call the p[MASK]lice . 
 While in Washington , Lead Belly encountered s[MASK]veral other incidents of segregation that are believed to have contributed to the impetus of the song . For instance , when Lead B[MASK]lly , Lo[MASK]ax , a[MASK]d their wives want[MASK]d to go out to d[MASK][MASK]ner tog[MASK]ther , they discovered that it was impossible for the[MASK]mixed race group to find a[MASK]resta[MASK]rant that would serve them . Lead Belly was told that if he returned later without Lomax , he would be served . 
 In response to one of these incide[MASK]ts , a friend of Lead B[MASK]lly 's , variously identified as either Lomax or Mary Elizabeth Barnicle joked that Washington was a "[MASK]bourgeois town . " Though Lead Belly did not kn[MASK]w [MASK]hat the word " bourgeois [MASK] meant , he was fascinated b[MASK] the sound o[MASK] it , and after its meaning was explained to him he decided to incorporate[MASK][MASK]t into a so[MASK]g about the trip . The song came together quic[MASK][MASK]y ; one account claims that i[MASK] only took a [MASK]ew hours for Lead Belly to write it . Lomax liked it because it was partly based on what happened in his apartmen[MASK] .

 " The Bourgeois Blues " is a blues @-@ styl[MASK] protest song that [MASK]riticizes the culture of Washington , DC . It protests against both the city 's Jim Crow laws and the racism of its white population . Its structure includes several verses and a refrain that declares that th[MASK] speaker is going to " spread the news all around "[MASK][MASK]bout the racial issues plagui[MASK]g the city . The song , particularly in the ref[MASK]ain , conflates race and economics by referring to Caucasians as[MASK]" bourgeois " . 
 The first two verses speak of the segregation that [MASK]ead Belly encountered in Washington DC : the first recounts the fact that during the trip , Lead Belly was "[MASK]turned down " wherever he t[MASK]ied to get served due to his race , while the second recount[MASK] the argument between Lomax [MASK]nd his landlord o[MASK]er Lead Belly staying in his apartment . The third verse sarcastically cites " the home of the brave , the land of the Free " , juxtaposed with the mistreatment he received at the hands of white [MASK]eople in Washingt[MASK][MASK] , DC . The four[MASK]h verse speaks of the[MASK]racism of the white population of the city , leading to the song 's end , which suggests that African Americans boycott buying[MASK]homes in the [MASK]istrict . 
 The song 's tone implie[MASK] that the speaker feels powerless against the discrimination and racism t[MASK]at he[MASK]encounters ; despite this[MASK], by " spreading the news " of his poor treatment in a song , the speaker uses what power he has to tell both southern African Americans a[MASK]d northern whites that the status quo is deeply flawed and that[MASK]somet[MASK]ing needs to change . 
 " The Bourgeois Blues " follows a traditional twelve @-[MASK] bar blues format . It is written in 4[MASK] time but annotated to note that the song rhythmically should swing at medium shuffle . The song was written i[MASK] B ♭ . It uses twelve measures with [MASK]erses one to four re[MASK]eating , followed by the final two v[MASK]rses and a coda .

 In 2006 , Billy Bragg reworked the song as "[MASK]Bush War Blues " . Bragg 's cover is a topical protest song about the Iraq War .

 " The Bourgeois Blues " is one of Lead Belly 's most famous songs and is remembered as his most " heartfelt protest song " .[MASK]There is disagreement among music scholars as to its importance . Robert Springer[MASK]claims that the song is " peripheral " to the wider study of the blues , while Lawson points to it as a watershed in the way African Americans see themselves in the fabric of t[MASK]e United States[MASK]. Th[MASK]re is debat[MASK] over the relationsh[MASK]p between[MASK]the song and radical politics . Af[MASK]er its r[MASK]lease , it became p[MASK]pular with left @-@ wing political groups . Lead Belly [MASK]as invited to pe[MASK]form at Camp Un[MASK]ty , the Commu[MASK]ist Party USA 's summer retreat , and the [MASK]BI subsequently opened a file on him [MASK]n the 1940s . This led to the accusations that the Communists were taking advantage of him and using him as a platform . The party claims , to the c[MASK]ntrary , that they were some of the few people who respected him and gave[MASK]him a chance to perform . 
 Jeff Todd Titon and several other writers have suggested that Lead Belly had significant help with its auth[MASK]rship and claim it is not a genuine protest song . This theory stems from the idea that Lead Belly did not have a history of pr[MASK]test music before he was discover[MASK]d by Lomax . Since the music th[MASK]t Lomax recorded was sold to northerners sympathetic to Civil Rights , it has been suggested that Lomax helped him write a song attrac[MASK]ive to a white audience . Lead Belly admitted that the term " bourgeoi[MASK] " was unfami[MASK]iar to[MASK]him , and it seems out o[MASK] place compared to the vocabulary of his past work .

It achieved commercial success , topping the singles charts in Italy , Spain , [MASK]omania and the U[MASK]ited Kingdom , whe[MASK]e it [MASK]ecame Madonna 's twelfth number one single . Elsewhere , the song was a top ten hit . However , in the United States , the song did not perform well due to an underplay on radio but was able to reach the top [MASK]f Billboard 's dance charts and b[MASK]came one of the decade 's most successful dance[MASK]hits . 
 The accompanying music video , directed by Madonna 's choreographer Jamie King , was a continuation from the " Hung Up " musi[MASK] video . It featured Madonna[MASK]and her dancers roaming around a city in a van , dancing on roller skates and Madonna fighting with a group of men in a cage . She performed the s[MASK]ng on her 2006 Confe[MASK]sions Tour in a similar fight sequence to that shown in the video . An addit[MASK]onal video w[MASK]s created as a backdrop for a remix of the song , which depicted political leaders and scenes of war and destruction .

 " Sorry " w[MASK]s o[MASK]e of the first tracks developed for Confessions on a Da[MASK]ce [MASK]loor [MASK] along with " Hung Up " and " Future Lovers " . It[MASK]was also[MASK]the one which took the most time to finish because Madonna " thought it was too melodramatic and could never decide when it was r[MASK]ght . " The s[MASK]ngs were developed with a remixed perspective in [MASK]ind . Madonna commented[MASK]that , " Whenever I mak[MASK] records , I often like the remixes better than the original ones . [ ... ] So I thought , sc[MASK]ew that . I 'm going to start from[MASK]tha[MASK] perspective " . She promoted the album at the dance party " Misshapes " held at Luke & Leroy [MASK]s nightclub in Greenwich Village , invited by Junior Sanchez to take over the DJ b[MASK]oth where she mixed[MASK]" Hung Up " with " Sorry " . Musically , " Sorry " is an uptempo dance song containing layers of beats and strong vocal on the chorus . It is set in common time with a moderately fast danc[MASK] [MASK]roove tempo of 132 beats per minute . Composed in the key of C[MASK]minor , Madonn[MASK] 's vocal range spans from [MASK]3 to G4 . It follows the chord progression of E ♭ – Cm – A ♭ – B ♭ during the s[MASK]oken introduction . It then changes to Fm – Gm @-@ Cm in the chorus [MASK] while continuing in [MASK] ♭ – Cm – A ♭ – Fm in the intermediate verses , ultimately ending in repeated lines o[MASK] " I 've heard it all before " . 
 L[MASK]rically the song has excerpts of different languages includin[MASK] Fr[MASK]nch , Spanish , Italian , Du[MASK]ch , Hebrew , Hindi , Polish and Japanese . The song talks about personal empowerment and self @-@ suff[MASK]ciency , denoting a shift in focus of Madonna as an ar[MASK]ist from her previous[MASK]songs about supremacy like " Everybody " ( 1982 ) , " Vogue " ( 1990 ) or " Music " ( [MASK]000 ) which was centered around the subject of mu[MASK]ic itself . Among the various remixes , the Pet Shop Boys remix inc[MASK]rporated Whitney Houston 's " I [MASK]anna Dance with Somebody ( Who Loves Me ) " with a m[MASK]re pr[MASK][MASK]ounced bassline and uses a double breakdown in the introduction . Pet Shop Boys and Madonna had al[MASK][MASK]ys mutually admired[MASK]each other , from the time they wrot[MASK] the son[MASK] " Heart "[MASK]( 1988 ) for Madonna but ne[MASK]er delivered it . The remix had added lyrics [MASK]ung by band member N[MASK]il Tennan[MASK] wh[MASK]ch[MASK]subsequently appeared on their remix[MASK]album Disco Four . Madonna 's voice hits on the first chorus which was remixed to have a masculine synth and a serious hook . A breakdown happens before the [MASK]ifth mi[MASK]ute ends , leading to the entry [MASK]f prog[MASK]ammed drum sounds after which the song ends .

[MASK]Jennifer Vineya[MASK]d of MTV News wrote that " Sorry " [MASK]s the " album 's strongest track " and that it is a "[MASK]Pet Shop[MASK]Boys @-@ esque " song . Vineyard[MASK]went on to say that it " ... wistfully evokes the sounds of the ' 80s @-@ era dance clubs that [MASK]irst lofted her toward stardom . " According to a review in the BBC 's Collective , " New single ' Sorry ' states Queen Madge 's unapologetic stance , and though the song is wrapped up in relati[MASK]nship sentiment , one cannot help but hear the subtext[MASK], perhaps directed at her more savage critics : ' there are more important things th[MASK]n hearing you speak ' . " Ala[MASK] Braidwo[MASK]d from BBC Music called the song " lethally catchy " . Mike Pattenden of The Times and Sal Cinquemani from[MASK]Slant Magazin[MASK] noted that the bas[MASK]line of the song utilizes The Jacksons ' 1980 song " Can You Feel It " . [MASK][MASK]e song was noted by Slant Magazine as one of the best songs of 2[MASK]06 . In a review of " Sorry " from Virgin Media , it wrote [MASK]hat the song 's musicscape features an " infectious combo of pumping , filtered synths and disco beats " .

" Jon Pareles of The New York Times wrote that the first half of the album consists of love songs , happy [MASK]nd sad , and included " Sorry " int[MASK] the mix . Alexi[MASK] Petridis from The Guardi[MASK]n called the song as triumphant . K[MASK]tt[MASK] Empi[MASK]e from the same newspaper said that " ' S[MASK]rry ' se[MASK]s Madonna taking a lover to task over an insistent dance @-@ pop rush . " Alan L[MASK]ght fro[MASK] Rolling Stone called the song " throbbing " .

 The music video incorporated parts of the television show Pim[MASK] My Ride , and was shot by Madonna in London in January 2006 while she was making plans for her then forthcoming Confessions Tour . It was directed by Madonna 's longtime choreographer Jamie King and featu[MASK]ed choreography from The Talauega Brothers .

The shoot took place f[MASK]r over two days[MASK]. 
 The video starts with Madonna standin[MASK] in fro[MASK]t of neon lighted screen [MASK]n a[MASK]purple leotard uttering " Sorry " in different languages . As the music starts she comes out from the gaming parlour of her " Hung U[MASK] " video with her dancers . They board a va[MASK] whe[MASK]e Madonna [MASK]nd her dancers strip of their clothes into new ones . Madonna wears a white leotard with a matching tassled corset with her hair in 1[MASK]70s r[MASK]tro inspired style and pair of knee high silver plat[MASK]orm boots . 
 As they move around the city in [MASK]he van , they pick up different men from the [MASK]treets to join them .

 The Hig[MASK] Five Interchange , north of downtown in Dallas , Texas , is a massive five @-@ level freeway interchange . It is the junction of two major highways[MASK]carrying heavy rush hour traffic , the Lyndon B. Johnson[MASK]Freeway ( [MASK]nterstate 635 ) and the Central Expressway ( US 75 [MASK] , and is the first five @-@ le[MASK]el[MASK]stack interchange to be built in the city . 
 It replaces the antiquated three @-@ level , modified cloverleaf interchange bui[MASK]t in the 1960s that caused a sev[MASK]re bottleneck by narrowing US 75 down to two lanes at the[MASK]junction of the two highways . The looped ramps of the cloverleaf force[MASK] motorists to slow[MASK]down drastically , backing up traffic . Left @-@ [MASK]and exits contri[MASK]uted to the congestion . Further , its [MASK]wo frontage roads were not directly connected to each other , making local access [MASK]ifficult . 
 Al[MASK]udi[MASK]g to the cel[MASK]bratory gesture , the " High Five " name refers to the five flyover ramps handling the l[MASK]ft @-@ turn movements tha[MASK] tower over t[MASK]e landscape . The interchange is as high as [MASK] 12 @-@ story building [MASK] and includes 43 bridges [MASK]pread across five levels ( the " High Five " ) [MASK] 710 support tiers , and 6[MASK] mile[MASK] of addit[MASK]onal highway . The highest ramps are 120 feet ( 37 m ) above ground . The[MASK]lanes of US 75 , which are on the bottom level , a[MASK]e 20 feet ( 6 m )[MASK]below ground level , giving the structure a total height of 140 feet from [MASK]ottom to top As[MASK]part of the proj[MASK]ct , I @-@ 635 was widened to include four dedicated high @-@ occupancy vehicle[MASK]lanes ( HOV lanes ) that are barrier @-@ s[MASK]parated and reversible . 
 The roads on the five levels are : 
 Level I : U[MASK] 75 ,[MASK]an eight lane highw[MASK]y , four lanes going each way 
 Level II : The jun[MASK]tion of the two six @-@ lane[MASK]frontag[MASK][MASK]roads , each having three through lanes in each direction , left @-@ turn lanes and turnarounds , and easy access to US [MASK]5 and I @-@ 635 
 Level III : I @-@ 635 , ten regular lanes , five going each way , and four HOV lane[MASK] ( two going each way ) separated by barriers 
 Level[MASK][MASK]V and V : Direct connection r[MASK]mps ( two levels ) , eliminating the left exits o[MASK] the modifi[MASK]d cloverleaf 
 The interchange , with its decorati[MASK]e etchings on precast[MASK][MASK]oncrete elements , along with the visually appealing coloration specified by the Texas Depar[MASK]ment of Transportation ( TxDOT ) , [MASK]a[MASK] be regarded as an enormou[MASK] work of public art . The High Five als[MASK] inco[MASK]porates a hi[MASK]ing[MASK]and bike trai[MASK] , named the Cottonwood Trail , which runs under all l[MASK]vels of the interchange . The section of the trail passing beneath the interchange was constructed as part of the High Fiv[MASK] project[MASK]by TxDOT . 
 The[MASK]interchange is considered by Popular Mechanics[MASK]as one [MASK]f " The World 's 18 Strangest Roadways " , calling it a " laby[MASK][MASK]nth of lanes " and a " five[MASK]@-@ level marvel of engineer[MASK]ng " because of its height , the number of its bridges and other unusual design and construction [MASK]eatures . 
 [MASK] = = History = = 
 
 The High Five Interchange project was planned as a replacement for the existing ,[MASK]antiquated interchange that accommod[MASK]ted 5[MASK]0 @,@ 000 vehicles daily and was located in one of the most inten[MASK]ely develo[MASK]ed commercial zones in Dallas . It was a collaborat[MASK]ve project between the TxDOT , affecte[MASK] motorists and property owners , and the primary contractor ,[MASK]Zachry Construction . An essential consideration was to complete the project with as little disru[MASK]tion to the traffic flow as[MASK]possible . 
 Reasons for upgra[MASK]ing the interchange , in[MASK]addition to the need to increase traffic fl[MASK]w and reduce congestion , were to improve air quality , safety , and local access . 
 Zachry Construction Corporation submitted [MASK]he lowest bid and was awarded the $ 261 million contract by TxDOT , the l[MASK]rgest ever by that agency . The co[MASK]struction contract for the High Five Interchang[MASK] was unique in tha[MASK] it contained elements not found in other construction project contracts . For example , it s[MASK]ecified the concrete maturity me[MASK]hod to be used to ensure the concrete 's strength [MASK][MASK]the first time TxDOT had ever done so ) , and containe[MASK] an early completion bonus , a sliding scale of up to $ 11 million if the company completed [MASK]he contract within four years . Also bui[MASK]t into the construction con[MASK]ract was a provision that Zachry was charged for " [MASK]ane[MASK]rentals " by TxDOT for time they clos[MASK]d down traffic lanes —[MASK]fees ba[MASK]ed o[MASK] hourly asse[MASK]sments and[MASK]the time[MASK]of day the lane was[MASK][MASK]losed . The fees ranged[MASK]from $ 50 to a high of $ 110 @,@ 000 for rush h[MASK]urs . In order not[MASK]to interfere with traffic f[MASK]ow during construction , the new interchange was de[MASK]igned largely as elevated flyover ramps and viaducts so they could be built high over the existing junction lanes [MASK] once traffic was transferred to the new structures the old lanes could simply be closed off and removed . Little of the original interchange remained when the project was finished . 
 To save time and money , innovative construction methods were emplo[MASK]ed : The original p[MASK]ans called for the segments of the lon[MASK] ramps and spans ( used to direct @-@ connect roads ) to be made of ste[MASK]l , but because building with s[MASK]eel would interfere with heavy traffic flow during construction , cast @-@ in @-@ place segmental concrete was subs[MASK]ituted in the plans . Howeve[MASK] , Zachry decided to use precast concrete s[MASK]gmental bridges ,[MASK]rather than casting the bridge elements in place , and used a unique m[MASK]chine , designed and constructed by Deal S.R.L. of Italy and c[MASK][MASK]ting about $ 1 million , to [MASK]ove the pieces into place . 
 During the construction , 2 @.@ 2 million cubic yards of earthwork was used , 350 @,@ 000 cubic yards of concrete was mixed on site , and 30[MASK] @,@ 000 square feet of retaining walls were built . Additionally , 40 @,@ 000 feet of drilled shafts and 75 @,@ 000 linear feet of drainage pipe were completed . In addition to the construction of 43 permanent br[MASK]dges , six temporary bridges were built , resulting in 2 @.@ 3 million square feet of bridge [MASK]eck . 
 The project w[MASK]s designed by the HNTB Corporation who provided professional engineering consultation throughout the construction , w[MASK]ich had begun in 2002 and was completed in December[MASK]2005 , more than 13 months sooner than planned .

 Tim Richmond ( June 7 , 1955 – August 13 , 1989 ) was an American race car driver from Ashland , Ohio .[MASK]He competed in IndyCar racing before transferring to NASCAR 's W[MASK]nst[MASK]n Cup Series ( now Sprint Cup Series ) [MASK] Richmond was one of the first drivers[MASK]to change from ope[MASK] wheel racing to NASCAR stock cars full @-@ time , which has since become an industry trend . He won the 1980 Indianapolis 500 Rookie of the Year award and had 13 victories during eight NASCAR seasons . 
 Richmond achieved his top NASCAR season in 1986 when he finished third in points . He won seven races that season , more than any other driver on the tour . When he missed the season @-@ opening Daytona 500 in Fe[MASK]ruary 1987 , media reported that he had pneumonia . The infectio[MASK] most likely r[MASK]sulted from his compromised immune system ,[MASK]which was weakened by AIDS . Despite the state of his health , Richmond competed in eight r[MASK]ces in 1987 , winning two events and one pole position before his final race[MASK]in August of that ye[MASK]r . He attempted a comeback in 1988 befor[MASK] NASCAR I banned him for testing positiv[MASK] for excessive OTC ( over the counter ) drugs , Ibuprofen and P[MASK]eudoephedrine ; NASCAR later announced they [MASK]ave Tim Richmond a new test and tested negative . Tim Richmond filed a lawsuit against NASCAR after NASCAR insisted they wanted access to his entire medical record before they would reins[MASK]a[MASK]e him , after losing the lawsu[MASK]t , Richmond withdrew from racing . NASCAR later stated their original test was a " Bad Test . " 
 Richmond grew up in a wealthy family [MASK]nd lived a freewheeling lifestyle , earnin[MASK] him the nickname " [MASK]ollywood " . In describing Richmond 's influence in racing , Charlotte Moto[MASK] Speedway president Humpy Wheeler said : " W[MASK] 've never had a race driver like Tim in s[MASK]ock car racing . He was almost a James Dean @-@ like character . " When Richm[MASK]nd[MASK]was cast for a bit p[MASK]rt in the 1983 movie Stroker Ace , " He fell right in with the group working on the fil[MASK] , " said[MASK]director Hal Need[MASK]am .

 Richmond[MASK]grew up in Ashland , Ohio . His parents , Al and E[MASK]elyn ( née Warner ) Richmond , met in the course o[MASK] their work . Al was a welder for pipe construction companies and Eve[MASK]yn was a field office manager . Noticing that highw[MASK]y crews had to dig up the entire highway to l[MASK]y [MASK]ipe , Al designed a machine to bore underneath the highway . To market[MASK]this invent[MASK]on , he founded Richmon[MASK] Manufact[MASK]ring , which ev[MASK]ntually exported machines worldwide . 
 Tim 's dri[MASK]in[MASK] days started as a toddler when he was given a go @-@ kart that he often drove inside buildings and across his lawn . He later raced the kart at tracks in Moreland and New P[MASK]ttsburg . Richmond grew up in a [MASK]e[MASK]l @-@ to @-@ do family , and was sometimes therefore treated differently by his classmates , so his parents enrolled him in Miami Mil[MASK]tary [MASK]cademy in Miami , Florida . D[MASK]ring his years in Miami ,[MASK]Tim and his mother moved to Flori[MASK]a and his father stayed in Ohio . While home in Ohio over a summer break , he[MASK]met local dra[MASK] racer Ra[MASK]mond Beadle through lifelong friend Fred Miller . When Richmond reached [MASK]ge 16 , his pa[MASK]ents purchased[MASK]him a Pontiac Trans Am , a speedboat and a Piper Cherokee airplane for his birthday . Yet his mother Evelyn often worried about spoiling her only son . She once said , " Tim was laz[MASK] ... " , and " ... I did eve[MASK]ything for him . [MASK] ruined him , I admit it . He was my whole life . " 
 Richmond excelled in sports ; he set a conference record in high hurdles and his high school football career was stellar enough that the academy retired his sports jersey after his gridiron [MASK]ays were over . Mia[MASK]i Military Academy named him Athlete of the Year in 1970 . Richmond 's other interests in[MASK]luded flying , and he earned his [MASK]rivate pilot licen[MASK]e at age 16 .

The race ended for him when his motor blew up on the fourth lap , and he finished last ( 23rd ) . Owner Pat Santello was looking for a driver to replace Larry Rice f[MASK]r his CART team [MASK]t the following race at Watkins Glen International , so he gave Richmond a test at Willow Spring where he had previously set the student record . Santello hired Richmond , who then qualified 15th fastest for the event and fin[MASK]shed[MASK]in eighth place , the best of his IndyCar career . Richmond raced in three more events that season . 
 After crashing during the first day [MASK]f qualifying fo[MASK] the 1980 Indianapolis 500 [MASK] Richmond [MASK]evertheless[MASK]obtained the 19th starting position in the race . He worked his way up[MASK]to the[MASK]top 10 during the race , led a lap , and finished ninth as he ran out of fuel at the end [MASK]f th[MASK] race . To[MASK][MASK]he delight of the crowd , winner Johnny Rutherford gave him a ride back to the [MASK]its . He was named the 1980 Indianapolis 500 Rookie of the Year . " I busted up[MASK]a few Indy cars right after that , " he said . " Milwaukee , Mid @-@ Ohio . . . at Michigan I cut one in two . I was afraid my racing career would come to a halt . So when I got an offer to drive stock cars , I took it , and it turned out I liked driving them better . "

 P[MASK]cono Raceway President Joseph Mattioli III convi[MASK]ced Richmond to make the change to stock car racing on the NASCAR circuit . Richmond mad[MASK] his first NASCAR start two months after winning the Indianapolis 500 R[MASK]okie of the Year award . He debut[MASK]d at the Coca @-@ Cola 500 at Pocono o[MASK] July 27 , 1980 [MASK] finishing 12th in a D. K. Ulrich @-@ owned Chevrolet . That season , he competed in five events [MASK] with two DNFs ( [MASK]id not finish ) and three 12th @-@ place finishes . Overall , he fini[MASK]hed the 1980 season 41st[MASK]in points . 
 Richmond raced for three teams in 1981 . He started the season by competing in 15 events for Ulrich . He had his first career top 10 finish , taking sixth place at Talladega Superspeedw[MASK]y , soon followed by a se[MASK]enth @-@[MASK]place[MASK]finish at Tex[MASK]s W[MASK]rld Speedway . After Kennie Childers hired him away from Ulrich mid @-@ season , Richm[MASK]nd had top 10 finishes at Pocono and Bristol . For the fi[MASK]al seven rac[MASK]s of the season[MASK], he[MASK]drove for Bob Rogers and had a top 10 finish at Dover International Speedway . Overall for the season , Richmond [MASK]ad six top 10 finishes to place 16th in season points . 
 Richmond sta[MASK]ted 1982 without a r[MASK]de before getti[MASK]g a one @-@ race deal to [MASK]rive for Billie Harv[MASK]y at th[MASK] Rockingham track . Richmond completed 112 laps of the 492 @-@ lap event to finish 31st , reti[MASK]ing from the race with engine problems . For the following event , Richmond was hired to drive J.D. Stacy 's No. 2 car . In his first race for the team , Richmond earned his fir[MASK]t career top 5 finish when he placed fifth at Darlington Raceway . Returning to Pocono , he finished second , before winning his [MASK]irst race on the road course at Riverside , California the fol[MASK]owing week . Later that[MASK]season , he earned his first pole positio[MASK] at Bristol . The tour returned to Riversi[MASK]e for the final race of the season where Richmond won his second race , [MASK]wee[MASK]ing both events at the track . Benny Parsons said that " watching Richmond go through the Esses was unbelievable " . For[MASK]the season , Richmond had twelve to[MASK] 10s , two wins , a[MASK]d one pole to finish 26th in points . 
 In 1983 , Richmond began racing for Raymo[MASK]d Beadle wh[MASK]m he had known before he star[MASK]ed racing . He returned to the three @-@ cornered Pocono racetr[MASK]ck , earni[MASK]g [MASK]is first oval victory . During the[MASK]season , he accumulated four pole positions ( Darlington , Pocono , Charlotte , and [MASK]tlanta ) , one win ( Pocono ) , and fifteen top 10s on his way to [MASK]inishing tenth in season points . He made his first appearance in a NASCAR Busch Series ( now Nationwide Series ) car , but did not finis[MASK] any of the three races he entered that season . 
 Esquire magazine n[MASK]med Richmond as one of[MASK]" the best of the new[MASK]generation " in 1984 . That year he had one win at North Wilkesboro Speedway and second @-@ place finishes at Dover , Darlingt[MASK]n and Rivers[MASK]de . Richmond finished the 1984 season 12th in points , w[MASK]th 11[MASK]finishes in the top 10 and in six in the top 5 . In 1985 , the final season that Richmond competed for Beadle , his best finish was a second @-@ place run at [MASK]ristol . He ended the season 11th in p[MASK]ints with[MASK]13 Top 10s in 28 races . In the Busch Ser[MASK]es , he q[MASK]alified at[MASK]the pole position in the two races he entered , [MASK]nd won the Charlotte race . 
 Ric[MASK]mon[MASK] joined Hendrick Motorsport[MASK] in 1986 , where he teamed up with veteran crew c[MASK][MASK]ef Harry Hyde [MASK] It took the team until the middle of th[MASK] season to ge[MASK] . Rich[MASK]ond had suffered a 64 @-@ race winless streak[MASK]that was finally broken at the Van Scoy Diamond M[MASK]ne 500 at Pocono in June 1986 . After two straigh[MASK] secon[MASK] @-@ pla[MASK]e finishes at Charlotte and Riverside , Richmond started the Pocono event in [MASK][MASK]ird[MASK]place inside the second row . That race saw a caution for rain with five laps left before t[MASK]e halfway point . NASCAR wanted the cars to get to the halfwa[MASK] point to make the race official , so the sanctioning body had the drivers slowly circle the track . It took the dr[MASK]vers 26 minutes to complete the laps , and the rain was so heavy that some[MASK]driver[MASK] had to look out their side w[MASK]ndows because they could not see[MASK]out their windshields . Tw[MASK] hours later , the track [MASK][MASK]d dried[MASK]and the race resumed with Richmon[MASK] in third . After Richmond 's car was adjusted to remove the " push " , the car was more to his liking . Because his radio did not work , he was unable to communicate with his crew c[MASK]ief , Hyde , and he made his final pit stop with 37 laps left[MASK]. Hyde worried that Richmond had stopped a lap too early to ensu[MASK]e that he would have enough fuel to [MASK]ake it to the end . After Richmond took the lead with 30 laps left in the rac[MASK] , Dale[MASK]Earnhardt made up three seconds on Richmond 's five @-@ second lead . With four laps to go , Buddy Arr[MASK]ngton spun in a three @-@ car accident[MASK]. The remaining laps of[MASK]the race where completed slow[MASK]y under caution and Richmond took the checkered flag for the victory . He had led 97 laps , including the fi[MASK]al 30 , taking his first victory in a Rick Hendrick car . 
 The tour returned to Pocono a month later , and Richmond battled for another v[MASK]ctory in a fog @-@ shortened event . In the final 8 @-@ lap sprint , Richmond c[MASK]mpeted in a three @-@ car battle with Geoff Bodine and Ricky Rudd . Richmond crossed the finish line beside Rudd , winning the race by 0 @.@ 05 seconds . He no[MASK]ched four more victories that s[MASK]ason , and over a span of twelve [MASK]aces , Richmond[MASK]earned [MASK]hree second @-@ place finishes , and six wins . The Natio[MASK]al Motorsports Press Ass[MASK]ciation named h[MASK]m Co @-@ Driver of the Year with Earnhardt[MASK]after Richmond accumulated 13 top 5 f[MASK]nish[MASK]s and 16 in the top 10 . He had a career @-@ best third @-@ place finish in points after winning seven events in 1986 , in what was hi[MASK] last full NASCAR season .[MASK]
 
 = = Illness and death =[MASK]= 
 
 Richmond fell ill the day after the 1986 NASCAR annual banquet during a promotional trip to New York . He was not well enough to begin the [MASK]987 NASCAR season despite lengthy hospitalizati[MASK]n in Cleveland and further rest at home ; when Richmond missed the Daytona 500 , his conditi[MASK]n was reported as do[MASK]ble pneumonia . Media later reported that he had tested positive for [MASK]cquire[MASK] immune deficiency sy[MASK]drome ( AIDS ) . He returned to Pocono for the Miller High Life 500 during the middle of the year . Starting third , he led by the fifth [MASK]ap and ultimately led 82 laps , including the final 46 , to win the race by eight car @-@ lengths over Bill Elliott . In the middle of the race , Richmond 's car [MASK]uffered gearbox problems . Because he could use only fourth [MASK] high ) gear , he had to use that gear to slowly exit the pits . Richmond was emotional after the victory , saying , " I had tears in my eyes when I took the checkered [MASK]lag . Then ever[MASK] time anyone congratulated me , I started bawling agai[MASK] . " Richmond earned a victory in the next race at Riverside , and mad[MASK] his final 1987 start at Michigan [MASK]nternational Speedway 's Champion[MASK]Spark Plug 400 that August , finishing 29t[MASK] wi[MASK]h a blown eng[MASK]ne . He resigned from Hendrick Motorsports in September 1987 . 
 Although Richmond attempted a comeback in 1988 , NASCAR suspended him for testing positive for banned substances . The substances [MASK]ere identified as Sudafed , a non[MASK]@-@ prescription over @-@ the @-@ counter allerg[MASK] medication , and Advil , an over @-@ the @-@ counter pain reliever . I[MASK] [MASK]pril 1988 , Richmond sued NASCAR over the suspension . Although he retested later that year and was reinstated , he could not find a car to drive . In his final public appearance in F[MASK]bruary 1988 , Richmond denied that he abused drugs and said that a mistake had been made in his drug test . His suit with NASCAR was settled out @-@ of @-@ court , the terms sealed . 
 Richmond [MASK]ithdrew into[MASK]his co[MASK]do in Florida . There were by then rumors of HIV and AIDS , which he denied . He was later hospitalized in West Palm Beach [MASK] 
 ESPN sent a get @-@ well @-@ soon card to Richmond when it air[MASK]d the July 1989 NASCAR race at Pocono . The television network showed hi[MASK]hlights of Richmond 's victory at the track from 1986 . " Tim had Hollywood[MASK]good looks and the chari[MASK]m[MASK] of Tom Cr[MASK]ise , " said his friend Dr. Jerry Punch . " There he was in victory lane with the team all around him and beauty queens hanging[MASK]all over him . It was important for the people at the hospital to see[MASK]Tim the way he really was , when he was[MASK]healthy and handsome and vital , not the way he was as [MASK]hey saw him [MASK]very da[MASK] in the hospital . " 
 On August 13 , 1989 , Richmond died at the age of 34 , about two years after his final NASCAR race . He was buried in As[MASK]land , Ohio[MASK]. 
 The secrecy s[MASK]rrounding the circumstanc[MASK] of his death caused speculation for seve[MASK]al days . At the t[MASK]me , Punch stated that Richmond had been hospitalized due [MASK]o a motorcycle accident , though it is unlikely that Richmond had the [MASK]tren[MASK]th to ride a motorcycle during his last months . Ten days after his death , on August 23 , the Richmond fam[MASK]ly held a press conference to reveal that Richmond died from complications from AIDS , which he acquired from an unknown woman . Richmond 's physician , Dr. David Dodson , said : " Ther[MASK] 's no way of knowing who that woman was . Tim was a celebrity w[MASK]th a lot of charisma , a handsome guy . He naturally attracted a[MASK]lot of women . " Punch later claimed that more than 90 drivers and pe[MASK]sonnel underwe[MASK]t HIV testing in the wake of Richmond 's death .

 In 1990 , a few months after Richmond 's death , Washington television station WJLA @-@ TV and reporter Roberta Baskin reported that Dr. Forest Tennant , who w[MASK]s then the National Football League 's drug ad[MASK]iser , " falsified drug tests " that ultimately helped shorten Richmon[MASK] 's NASC[MASK]R career . Bas[MASK]in reported that sealed court documents and interviews showed Tennant and NASCAR used " allegedly false drug @-@ test results in 1988 to bar Richmond from racing " . Baskin also stated that NASCAR had targeted Richmond , reques[MASK]ing that Tennant establish a substance @-@ abuse policy with Richmond in mind . A series of drug tests and falsely reported positive results shortly before the 1988 Daytona 500 kept Richmond from dri[MASK]ing in what was to have been his last big race ... " , the report said . The New York Times published the findings . While neither Tennant nor NASCAR supplied [MASK]n official r[MASK]sponse at the time , NASCAR did confirm that they [MASK]ere seeking to replace Tennant . [MASK] The Ashland County [MASK]ports [MASK]all of Fame inducted [MASK]ichmond in their seco[MASK]d class in 1996 . In 1998 , NASCAR named Richmond one of its 50 greatest drivers of all time . He was inducted int[MASK] the International[MASK]Motorsports Hall of [MASK]ame in 2002 . The Mansfield Motorsports Park ARCA Re[MASK]/ Max Series race in 2009 was named the Tim Richmond[MASK]Memorial ARCA Re / Max 250[MASK]in honor of the area native . The race at Mansfield was co @-@ promoted by Mattioli 's son Joseph Mattioli III . 
 The documentary film Tim Richmo[MASK]d : To The Limit was produced as part of ESPN 's 30 for 30 series with a premiere date of October 19 , 2010 .

 The [MASK]rout Creek Mountains are a remote , semi @-@ arid Great Basin mountain range mostly in southeastern Oregon a[MASK]d pa[MASK]tially in northern Nevada in the United States . The range 's [MASK]ighest point [MASK]s Orevada View Benchmark[MASK], 8 @,@ [MASK]06 feet ( 2 @,@ 593 m ) above sea level , i[MASK] Nevada[MASK]. Disaster Pea[MASK] , elevat[MASK]on 7 @,@ 781[MASK]feet ([MASK][MASK] @,@ 372 m ) , i[MASK] another prominent su[MASK]mit in the Nevada portio[MASK] of the mountains . 
 The mountains are c[MASK]aracteristic of the Great Basin 's topography of mostly parall[MASK]l mountain ranges alternating with flat valleys . Oriented [MASK]enerally north to south ,[MASK]the Trout Creek Mountains consist primarily of fault blocks of basal[MASK] , which came from an ancient volcano and ot[MASK]er[MASK]vents , [MASK]n top of older metamorphic rocks . The southern end of[MASK]the range , however , features many granitic outcrops . As a whole , the faulted terrain is dominated by rolling hills and ridges c[MASK]t by escarpments and canyons . 
 Most of the range is public lan[MASK] administered by the federal Bureau of Land Man[MASK]gement . There is very little human development in the remote region — cattle grazing and ranching are the primary human uses — but former mines at the McDermitt Caldera pro[MASK]uced some of the lar[MASK]est amounts of mercury in North America in the 20th century . Public lands in the m[MASK]untains[MASK]are open to recreation but are rarely v[MASK]sited . Ve[MASK]etation includes large swaths of big sagebrush in addition to desert grasses and cottonwood and alder stands . Sage grouse and mountain c[MASK]ickadee are two bird species native t[MASK] the range , and common mammals include prongho[MASK]n and jackrabbits . 
 Despite the area 's dry climate , a few year @-@ round streams provid[MASK] habitat for the rare Lahontan cutthroat trout . Fish populations in the T[MASK]out Creek Mountains declined throughout much of the 20th century . In the 1980s , the effects of grazing allotments on riparian zones and the fish led to land @-@ use conflict . The Trout Creek Mountain Working[MASK]Group was formed in 1988 to help resolve disagreements among livestock owners , env[MASK]ronmentalists , government agenc[MASK]es , and other intere[MASK]ted parties [MASK] The stakeholders met and agreed on changes to land @-@ use practices , and since the early 1990s , riparian zones have begun to recover .

 The T[MASK]out Creek Mountains are in a very remote area of southeastern Oregon [MASK]nd nort[MASK]ern Nevada , in Harney and Humboldt counties . The nearest human settlements are the Whitehorse Ranch , abo[MASK]t 20 miles ( 32 km ) directly north from the middle of the mo[MASK]ntains ; Fi[MASK]lds , Oregon , about 23 miles ( 37 km ) to the northwest ; Denio [MASK] Nevada , about 15[MASK]miles[MASK]( 24 km ) to the west ; and McDermitt , Nevada – Oregon , about 30 miles ( 48 km ) to the east . The mountains are about 150 miles ( 240 km ) directly southwest of Boise ,[MASK]Id[MASK]ho , an[MASK] [MASK]bout 190 miles ( 310 km )[MASK]northeast of Reno , Nevada [MASK] 
 The range and surrounding non @-@ mountainous areas cov[MASK]r an area of 8[MASK]1 square miles ( 2 @,@ 100 km2 ) . The mountains run 51 miles ( 82 km ) north t[MASK] south and 36 miles ( 58 km [MASK] east to west . More of the range is in Oregon ( 78 % ) than in Ne[MASK]ada[MASK]( 22 % ) . The highest point in the range is Orevada View Benchmark , which is 8 @,@ 506 feet ( 2 @[MASK]@ 593 m ) above sea level and[MASK]is located in Nevada about one mile south of the O[MASK]egon border . About two miles southeast [MASK]f Orevada View is Disaster Peak , " a large , symmetrical butte tha[MASK] [MASK]s visible throughout the region . " At 7 @[MASK]@ 781 feet ([MASK]2 @,@ 372 m ) , Di[MASK]a[MASK]ter Peak anchors the sou[MASK]hern en[MASK] of the mountains in a sub @-@ range called The Granites . 
 The Oregon Canyon Mountains border the Trout Creek Mountains on the east along the Harney – Malheur county line ( according to the United States Geological Survey 's d[MASK]finitions ) , while the Pueblo Mountains are the next range west of the Trout Creek Mountains . The Bilk Creek Mountains in both Oregon and Nevada border the Trout[MASK]Creek Mountains on the southwest ; the two ranges are separated by Log Cabin Cree[MASK] and South Fork Cottonwood Cree[MASK] . South [MASK]f the T[MASK]out Creek Mountains is the [MASK]ings Riv[MASK]r Valley , which separ[MASK]tes the Bil[MASK] Creek Mountains on the west from the Montana Mountains on the east . 
 The terrain in t[MASK]e Trout C[MASK]eek Mountains varies from [MASK]road ,[MASK]flat basins and rolling ridges to high rock escarpments cut by deep canyons . The canyons have steep walls with loose talus s[MASK]opes at the bottoms . There are meadows around springs in the [MASK]ountains , although most streams in the range do not flow year @-@ round . Major streams[MASK]that flow off the north slopes of the mountains include ( from west to east ) Cott[MASK]nwood C[MASK]eek , Trout Cre[MASK]k , Willow Creek , and Whitehorse Creek . These streams all flow into endorheic basins in Harney County , Oregon . Trout Creek and Whitehorse Creek are the largest of the four . The Kings River and [MASK]c[MASK]ermitt Creek e[MASK]ch drain an area on the south slopes of the Trout Creek Mountains . The Kings River begins in [MASK]he Granites[MASK]and flows south into Nevada , where it meets th[MASK] Quinn River , which evaporates in the Black Rock Desert . McDermitt Creek begins in Oregon a few miles north of Th[MASK] Granites and fl[MASK]ws generally east , crossing the Oregon –[MASK]Nev[MASK]da border five times before d[MASK]sappear[MASK]ng into the floor of the Quinn River Valley south of McDermitt .

 The mountains lie within the Basin and Range Province or Gr[MASK]at Basin of the Western United State[MASK] , which is characterized by a series of parallel fault blocks that form long north – south mountain rang[MASK]s separated by wide , high @-@ desert valleys . The Trout Creek Mountains are uplifted and tilted blocks with steep escarpments along the southern and eastern sides of the range . The southern area of the range , known as The Granites , has numerous outcroppings o[MASK] Cretaceous age granite .[MASK]These granite outcrops are commonly found in the eroded [MASK]alleys below the volcanic ridgelines . 
 The Trout Creek Mountains are composed mostly of basalt from a shield volcano that once stood where Steens Mountain is today . Crustal th[MASK][MASK]ning and the Yellowstone hotspot , which was then be[MASK]eath south[MASK]astern Orego[MASK] , induce[MASK] eruptions from Steen[MASK] and nearby vents about [MASK]7 million years ago , in the Miocene . The vents produced a series of la[MASK]a flows that spread across the land now known as the Trout Creek Mountains . Eruptions from the Steens volc[MASK]no lasted for about one million years , and at least 70 separate lava flows occurred . Under the resulting basalt[MASK]rock lie much older metamorphic rocks that may be related to so[MASK]e of the Triassic age formations o[MASK] the Blue Mountains in northeastern Oregon . Wi[MASK]hin these metamorphic rocks are diorite and granodiorite intrusive bodies which were presumably intruded during the Cretaceous Period . 
 The broad McDermitt Caldera is a prominent geologic feature in the Trout Creek Mountains . The ov[MASK]l @-@ shaped [MASK]aldera is a collapsed lava dome th[MASK]t straddles the Oregon – Nevad[MASK] border on the eastern side of the range and south of the Oregon Can[MASK][MASK]n Mountains . It is about 28 miles ( 45 km ) long and 22 miles ( 35 km [MASK] wide . The l[MASK]va dome was created by volcanic eruptions in the early Miocene . A total of f[MASK]ve large ash flows were produced along with a l[MASK]rge rhyolite dome structure . T[MASK]e caldera formed when the dome collapsed about 16 million years ago . The caldera contains significant ore depo[MASK]its , and m[MASK]rcury and uranium have bee[MASK] mined at eight or more sites in and around the caldera . Ot[MASK]er areas in the caldera were mined for ores of antimony , cesium , and lithium . 
 
 = = Climate = = 
 
 The Trout Creek Mountains are semi @-@ arid because they are in the eastern rain shadow of mounta[MASK]n ranges to the west . When m[MASK]ist air from the Pacif[MASK]c Ocean moves eastward over[MASK]the Oregon and C[MASK]lifornia c[MASK]astal [MASK]anges and the Cascade Range , most precipitation falls in those mountai[MASK]s before reaching the Trout Creek Mountains .[MASK]As a result , the average [MASK]nnual precipitation in the Trout Creek Mountains [MASK]s only 8 to 26 inches ( 200 to 660 mm ) per year , wit[MASK] most areas receiving betwe[MASK]n 8 and 12 inches ( 200 and[MASK]300 mm ) annually . Much of the annual precipitation occurs between the beginning of March and the end of June . Most of the rest falls as snow during the fall and[MASK]winter months . Sn[MASK]wpack at elevations below 6 @,@ 000 feet ( 1 @,@ 800 m ) usually melts by April ; [MASK]oweve[MASK] , at the higher elevations , snow can remain until mid @-@ June . Local flooding often occurs in the sprin[MASK] as the snowpack melts . 
 The pre[MASK]ailing winds are from the west [MASK]-@ southwest , and they are normally strongest in March and April . Brief , intense thunderstorms are common between April and October . Thunderstorms[MASK]in the summer months tend to be more isolated and often produce dry lightning strikes .

 Vegetation in the Trou[MASK] Cre[MASK]k Mountains i[MASK] dominated by big sagebrush and desert grasses . Other common shrubs include bitter[MASK]rush , snowberry , and Ceanothus . T[MASK]ere are also patches of moun[MASK]ain mahogany in some are[MASK]s . Common grass species include Idaho [MASK]escu[MASK] , bluebunch wheatgrass , cheatgrass , western needlegrass , Sandberg 's b[MASK]uegrass , Thurbe[MASK] 's needlegrass , and bo[MASK]tlebrush squirreltail , a[MASK] well as basin wildrye in some wel[MASK] @-@ drai[MASK]ed areas .[MASK]
 Less than one per[MASK][MASK]nt of the rang[MASK] co[MASK]sists of meadow wetlands and riparian greenways ( vegetation along stream banks ) . [MASK]owever , these areas are vital to th[MASK] local ecos[MASK]stem . The [MASK]eadows surround springs , which are mostly on gently sloping uplands or in stream bottoms , and range in size from about 1 to [MASK] acres [MASK] 0 @.@ 40 to 2 @.@ 02 ha ) . Narrow riparian greenways follow the year @-@ round streams . Many greenway areas have quaking [MASK]spen and willow groves . Cottonwood and a[MASK][MASK]er grove[MASK] can b[MASK] found at lower elevat[MASK]ons where[MASK]terrain is flatter and stream channe[MASK]s are wider . Sedges and rushes are also native to t[MASK]ese stream bottoms . Years of heavy livestock grazing in parts of the range resulted in the loss of some grass species , riparian vegetation , and young aspen and willow trees . Restorati[MASK]n of riparian areas began in the early 1970s ,[MASK]and plans to reduce grazing were implemented in the 1980s and early 1990s . However , large wildfires in southeastern Oregon during the summer of 2012 burned much of the range 's v[MASK]getation , damaging riparian ecosystems an[MASK] k[MASK]lling hundreds of grazing cattle .

 Animals in the[MASK]Trout Creek Mounta[MASK]ns are adapted to the environment[MASK]of the High Desert . Pronghorn are c[MASK]mmon in the open , sagebrush @-@ covered basins , [MASK]hile mule deer live in the cottonwood[MASK]and willow groves . There are also bighorn sheep , cougars , and bobcats in the high countr[MASK] . Jackrabbits and coyotes are prevalent throughout the range . Mustangs sometimes pass through the mountains as they roam the Great Basin . Some other mammals i[MASK]clude the northern pocket gopher , [MASK]ountain cottontail , and Belding 's ground squirrel . North American beavers live in and along streams , as do Pacific tree frogs , western spadefoot [MASK]oads , and[MASK]garter snakes . Native bird species include the sage grouse , mountain chickadee , gray @-@ headed junco , black @-@ throated gray warbler , Virginia 's warbler , MacGillivray 's warbler , pine siskin , red crossbill , bushtit , hermit thrush , northern goshawk , and [MASK]pecies of raven [MASK]nd eagle . 
 Several streams in the Trout Creek Mountains are home to trout , including the rare Lahontan cutthroat trout subspecies . These include Wil[MASK]ow Creek , Whitehorse Creek , Little Whitehorse Creek , Doolittle Creek , Fifteen Mile Creek , Indian Creek , Sage Canyon Creek , Line Canyon Creek , and some tributaries of McDermitt Creek . Lahontan cutthroat trout[MASK]live in small , isolated populations that are often confined to[MASK]individua[MASK] streams , many of them in the T[MASK]out Creek Mountains . These populations have significant genetic differences due to their history of isolation . Fo[MASK] most of the 20th century , the trout 's numbers declined consider[MASK]bl[MASK] . It was listed u[MASK][MASK]er federal [MASK]aw as an endangered species in 1970 and was reclassified as thre[MASK]tened in 1975 . Reasons for the fish 's decline included habitat degradation from cattle grazing , drought , overfis[MASK]ing , competition with other fish , and hybridizati[MASK]n with introduced rainbow trout , which decreased t[MASK]e number of genetically pure Lahontan cutthroat trout . However , reductions in cattle grazing in riparian zone[MASK] sinc[MASK] the 1980[MASK] allowe[MASK] fish habitat and populations to start to recover .

 The Bureau[MASK]of Land Management ( BLM ) administers most land in the Trout Creek [MASK]ountains , but there are also some private lands and some roads in the area . The private lands are mainly used for ranching along mountain streams , while the BLM lands include large grazing all[MASK]tments for local ranchers ' c[MASK]ttle . At least 100 mining claims in the mountains have been recorded since 1892 , some of which were staked for gold exploration . C[MASK]mmercial mining has occurred in some areas , mostly[MASK]near the McDermitt Caldera , where uranium and la[MASK]ge am[MASK]unts of mercury have[MASK]been[MASK]extracted[MASK]. Mines in what was called the Opalite[MASK]Mining Dist[MASK]ic[MASK] produced 270 @,@ 000 flasks of mercury — " the richest suppl[MASK] of mercury in the western hemisphere " — from cinnabar extracted from the cald[MASK]ra in the 20th century .

 Cattl[MASK] grazi[MASK]g in the Trout Creek Mountains began in the late 19th ce[MASK]tury , and the BLM [MASK]urrently oversees grazing allotments in the area . Cattle can be fo[MASK]nd grazing in some areas during th[MASK] spring and summer months . The effects of grazing on the local environment were the subject of controversy in the 1980s . 
 [MASK] = = [MASK]and @-@ mana[MASK]ement compromise = = 
 
 By the 1970s and 1980s , a century of intense cattle grazing had reduced much of the riparian vegetation along stream banks in the Trout Creek [MASK]ountains and elsewh[MASK]re in the Great Basin . As a result , stream banks were eroding and upland vegetation was encroaching into riparian zones . Aspen populations declined as grazing cattle eliminated young trees , decreasing sha[MASK]e over streams and raising water temperatures . These conditions put the rare Lahontan cutthroat trout population at risk . Since the Lahontan was officially de[MASK]ignated as a threatened species , environmental groups began advocat[MASK]ng the cancellation [MASK]f grazing permits in the Trout Creek Mountains . 
 Beginning in the early 1970s , the Bureau o[MASK] Land Management identified damaged riparian zones and began projects to restore n[MASK]tural habitat in those areas . Approximately 20 [MASK],@ 000 willow trees were planted along streams , [MASK]mall dams were put together to create more pools in the streams , an[MASK] fencing was added to protect riparian zones from grazing . Next , the agency sought to reform lan[MASK] @-@ use plans to change grazing practices , which became a comp[MASK]ex and controversial project . 
 As environmentalists pressed the BLM to close much of the Trout Creek[MASK]Mountains to grazing , frustrat[MASK]d ranchers joined[MASK]the Sagebrush Rebellion seeking to protect their grazing allotments[MASK]. Initial[MASK]y , it appeared that the issue of grazing in the range would produce prolonged liti[MASK]ati[MASK]n with appeals potentially[MASK]lasting dec[MASK]des . However , in 1988 , interest groups representing all sides of the issue joined to form the[MASK]Trout Creek Mountain Working Group . The group 's goal was to find a solution acceptable to everyone — a plan that would protect both [MASK]he land 's ecological health and ranchers ' economic needs . 
 Initial members of the Trout Cree[MASK] Mountain Working[MASK]Group included : 
 Over the next several ye[MASK]rs , the[MASK]group continued to meet and discuss options for restoring the land while meeting t[MASK]e economic needs of local ranchers . Meetings we[MASK]e all open to the public . 
 The group[MASK]eventually en[MASK]orsed a grazing management plan that provided for both the ecological health of sensitive[MASK]riparian areas and the ec[MASK]nomic well @-@ being of ranchers . In 1989 , the Whitehorse Ranch agreed to res[MASK] two grazing allotments totaling 50 @,@ 000 acres ( 20 @,@ 000 ha ) to restore critical stream greenways and mountain pastures . The ranch 's allotment[MASK]on Fifteen Mile Creek was rested for three[MASK]years , a[MASK]d its Willow Creek pasture received a five @-@ year rest b[MASK]fore [MASK]razing was resumed . In ad[MASK]ition , the grazing season in mountain pastures was reduced from four months to two , an[MASK] the tot[MASK]l number of cattle released in the allotment areas was reduced from 3 @,@ 800 to 2 @,@ 200 . Finally , sensitive areas were fen[MASK]ed to protect them from cattle , and additional water sources were constructed away from streams . Other ranches also agreed to rest specific pastures including the Trout Creek , Cot[MASK]onwood Creek , and Whitehorse Butte allotments . 
[MASK]In 1991 , the Bureau of Land Management appro[MASK]ed a new grazing allotment mana[MASK]ement plan . It was based on the agreements made by the Trout Cre[MASK]k Mountain Working Group , and it took effect[MASK]in 1992 . Since then , vegetation in riparian areas of the Trout Creek Mountains has recovered , and studies by the United States Fish and Wildlife Service [MASK]ave found that the Laho[MASK]tan[MASK]cutthroat trout populat[MASK]on , still listed as threatened , is also recovering .

 Mycena inclinata , commonl[MASK] known as the clust[MASK]red bonnet or the oak @-@ stump bonnet cap , is a species of mushroom in[MASK]th[MASK] family Mycenaceae[MASK]. The doubtfully edible mushroom has a reddish[MASK]@-@ brown bell @-@ shaped cap up to 4 @.@ [MASK] cm ( 1 @.@ 8 in ) in diameter .

 First described as Agaricus inclinatus by Swedish mycologist Elias Mag[MASK]us Fries in 1838 , it was assigned its current name in 1872[MASK]by Lucien Quélet . Mycena galericulata var.[MASK]calopus ( [MASK]amed by Karsten in 1879 ) , and it[MASK] basionym Agaricus galericulatus var. calopus ( n[MASK]med by Fries in [MASK]873 ) , are synonyms . 
 In a molecular study of the large su[MASK]unit ribosomal DNA sequenc[MASK]s of mycorrhizal f[MASK]ngi of the orchid Gastrodi[MASK] confusa , M. inclinata was found to be closely related to M. aurantiomarginata , M. crocata , and M. leaiana .

 Mycena inclinata is a saprobic fungus , deriving[MASK]its nutrients from decomposing organic matter fou[MASK]d in plant litter such as leaves , twigs , bark and branches . It accomplishes th[MASK]s by producing enzymes [MASK]apable of breaking down the three major biochemical components of plant cell walls found in litter : cellulose , hemicellulos[MASK] and lignin . 
 The fruit bodies of Mycena inclinata grow in dense groups or clusters on decaying hardwood logs and stumps ( especia[MASK]ly oak [MASK]nd chestnut ) during the spring and autumn . The fungus forms a white , woolly mycelium on the[MASK]surface of decomposing oak leaves . Occasionally , it can be found growing on a living tree . In ea[MASK]tern North America , it is[MASK]abundant in the area [MASK]ounded by Nova Sco[MASK]ia , Ontario , Manitoba , Missouri , North Caro[MASK]ina , and New York . It has been [MASK]ound in Oregon , but the species appears to be generally rare along the Pacific Coast .

 Capel Lligwy ( sometimes referred to as Hen Gapel Lligwy ) is a ruined chapel near Rhos Lligwy in[MASK]Anglesey , north Wales , dating bac[MASK] to the first hal[MASK] of the 12th century . The chapel 's original purpose is unknown , but it might [MASK]a[MASK]e [MASK]een used as a memorial chapel or in connection with a local roya[MASK] court , or as a c[MASK]apel of ease in a large parish with a growing population . It was[MASK]u[MASK]ed for a time[MASK]until the e[MASK]rly 18th century as a private place of worship for a nearby house [MASK] th[MASK]n later fell into disrepair .

 The oldest parts of[MASK]Capel Lligwy[MASK]date fr[MASK]m the first half of the 12th century . This was a time when many churches on Anglesey in n[MASK]rth @-@ west W[MASK]les were first built in stone following the end of Viking raids and attempts by the Normans[MASK]to gain contr[MASK]l of the island . The reason for its construction , and the saint to wh[MASK]m it was dedicated , are unknown [MASK] Geraint Jones , author of a 2006 guide to the ch[MASK]rches[MASK]of Anglesey , suggests that it m[MASK]y originally [MASK]ave been a memorial chapel , o[MASK] connected to[MASK]a royal court n[MASK]arby . Yates and Longley , authors of a 2001 guide to [MASK]ncient A[MASK]glesey monuments , note that it was built in the large parish of Penrhos Lligwy and was perhaps intended to serving the expanding population in medieval times . Despite this , it seems to have remained as a chapel of ease rather than become a parish church in its own right[MASK]. The chapel is sometimes referred to as " Hen Gapel Lligw[MASK] " ( " hen " being the Welsh word for " old " and "[MASK]capel " meaning " chapel " ) . 
 The walls were partially rebuilt in the 14th century , and the upper parts of the walls date from thi[MASK][MASK]time . A chapel was added to t[MASK]e south side of the building in the 16th century . A vault under the[MASK]south chap[MASK]l was used to bury members of a local family , the Pierce Lloyds . In 1999 , the vault was used to record some " atmos[MASK]heres " for [MASK]he album " You Have Just Been Poisoned By The Serpents " by The [MASK]erpents , a collective of Wels[MASK] musicians including members of Echo and[MASK]the Bun[MASK]ymen , Super Furry Animals and Ectogram that was described by one journal[MASK]st as " possibly th[MASK] strangest pop group of all time " . 
 For a time , Capel Lligwy wa[MASK] used [MASK]s a private place of worship for Lligwy House , a " venerable mans[MASK]on " once owned by the Lloyd family which came into [MASK]he possession of William Irby , 1s[MASK] Baron Boston , in the 18th century . After the early part of the 18th century , however , the chapel became unused and began to fa[MASK]l into disrepair [MASK] The walls remain to gable level , wi[MASK]h some traces of render on the inside , but the roo[MASK] has gone . 
 Cap[MASK]l Lligwy is in th[MASK] Anglesey countryside near Llanallgo ; the parish church of St Gallgo , Llanallgo is about 0[MASK]@.@ 78 miles ( 1 @.@ 26 km ) away [MASK] Part[MASK]of the churc[MASK]ya[MASK]d wall remains , showing [MASK]hat it was originally within a mainly circular enclosure , as often found with early churches .

 Capel Lligwy has national recognition and statut[MASK]ry protection [MASK]ro[MASK] alteration as it has [MASK]een designated as a Grade II listed building – the lowest of the three grades of listing , design[MASK]ting " buildings of special interest , which warrant ever[MASK] effort being mad[MASK] to preserve [MASK]hem " . It was given this status on 2 September 1952 and has been listed because it is " important as a substantially 12t[MASK] @-@ century structure , with some architectural details surviving from this early period " ,[MASK]even though it is now in [MASK] " ruinous condition " . Cadw ( which [MASK]s responsible for the inclusion of Welsh buildings on the statutory lists )[MASK]also n[MASK]tes the " unusual 16th @-@ ce[MASK]t[MASK]ry vaulted south chapel " . 
 The 19th @-@ century antiquarian Angharad Llwyd mentioned the church in her history of Anglesey . She said that the architecture was of " the rudest kind , [ which ] bears testimony to its great ant[MASK]quity . " She recounted that a fox had on[MASK]e taken shelter in the ruins , and when it was dug out , the vault was discovered , " containing several human skeleto[MASK]s , which crumbled into dust , when exposed to the air " . She [MASK]dded that further expl[MASK]ration of the vault then revealed " a large mass of human bones , sever[MASK]l feet in depth "[MASK]. 
 A 1990 book about abandoned churches in Wales [MASK]efers to t[MASK]e ancien[MASK] monuments in this part of Anglesey , and calls Capel Lligwy a " medieval gesture of Christian power in a land so obviously imbued with the spirit of a pagan past " . It notes[MASK]that " the wheel [MASK]as turned full circle and Capel Lligwy today is just another ruined r[MASK]lic of a former age . " The authors describe the chapel as a [MASK] simple , square building " with a " small and ruggedly austere south chapel " ,[MASK]adding that the stone slabs [MASK]ver the vault are " almost in imitation of the ancient burial chambers which dot the surrounding landscape .

 The team lost se[MASK][MASK]or captains Stu Douglass and Zack Novak as well as senior reserve Corey Person to gradua[MASK]ion following the sea[MASK]o[MASK] . Person was later [MASK]ranted an extra year of eligibility to return to the team . A[MASK] the end of the season , three players ( Evan Smotrycz , Carlton Brundidge and[MASK]Colton [MASK]hristian ) decided to leave the program .

 Following the season , Trey Burke first said he was not inclined to enter the 2012 NBA Draft . A few days later , howe[MASK]er , the realization that the pool of point guards in the 2012 draft wa[MASK] [MASK]hallow and Burke 's stock was high led to some deliberation for him and his[MASK]family : " When you[MASK]have a season a[MASK] a freshman like he did , the NBA , they like them [MASK]oung , " Trey 's father , Benji Bu[MASK]ke said . " They think their ceili[MASK]g is higher when they 're young . Trey had ... a solid season for a freshman .

 Upsilon Andromedae b [MASK] abbreviated υ Andromedae b , υ And b [MASK] , occasionally designated Up[MASK]ilon Andromedae Ab ( t[MASK] distinguish it from the red dwarf Upsilon Andromedae B ) , also named Saffar , is an extrasolar planet approxim[MASK]t[MASK]ly 44 light @-@[MASK]years a[MASK]ay from the Sun in the constellation of And[MASK]omeda . The planet orbits the Solar twin star , Upsilon Andromedae A , approximately every five days . Discovered in J[MASK]ne 1996 by [MASK]eoffrey Marcy and R. Paul Butler , it was [MASK]ne of the first hot Jupiters to be discovered . It is also one of the first non @-@ resolved planets to be detected directly . Upsilon Andromedae b is the innermost known planet in its[MASK]planetary system . 
 In[MASK]July 2014 the In[MASK]ernational Astronomi[MASK]al Union launched a process for giving proper names to ce[MASK]tai[MASK] exoplanets and their host stars . The process[MASK]involve[MASK] publ[MASK]c nomination and voting for the new names . In December 201[MASK] , t[MASK]e IAU[MASK]announced the winning name was Saffar for this planet . The winning name was submitted by the Vega Astronomy Club of Morocco and honours the 11th Century astronomer Ibn al @-@ Saffar of Muslim Spain . 
 
 = = Discovery = = 
 
 Like the majority of known extrasolar planet[MASK] , Upsilon Andromeda[MASK] b was detected by the variations in its star 's radial velocity caused by the pla[MASK]et 's gravity . The variations were detected by making sensitive measu[MASK]emen[MASK]s [MASK]f[MASK][MASK]he Do[MASK]pler shift of Upsilon Andromedae 's spectrum[MASK]. The planet 's existence was announced in January 1997 , together with 55 Cancri b and the planet orbiting Tau Boötis . 
 Like [MASK]1 Pegasi b , the first ex[MASK]ras[MASK]lar planet discovered around a normal star , Upsilon Andromedae b orbi[MASK]s very close t[MASK] its star[MASK], clos[MASK]r than Me[MASK]cury does to [MASK]ur Sun . The planet takes 4 @.@ 617 days to complete an orbit , with a semimajor axis of 0 @.@ 0595 AU . 
 A limitation of the radial velocity method used [MASK]o detect Upsilon Andro[MASK]edae b is that only a lower limi[MASK] on the mass can be found . In the case of Upsilon Androm[MASK]dae b , this lower lim[MASK]t is 68 @.@ 7 % of the mass of J[MASK]piter , though depending on the inclination of the orbit[MASK], the true mass may be much gre[MASK]ter . Ho[MASK]ever , astronomers found re[MASK]ently that inclination of the [MASK]rbital plane is around 25 ° a[MASK]d the tru[MASK] mass may be about 1 @.@ 4 MJ . Cop[MASK]anarity is not to be ass[MASK]med ; the mutual inclination between c and d is 35 degrees . 
 
 = = Physical characteristics = = 
 
 Given the p[MASK]anet 's high mass , it is likely that Upsilon Andromedae b is a gas giant with no s[MASK][MASK]id[MASK]surface . 
 The Spitzer Space Telescope measured the planet temperature , [MASK]nd found that the difference between the two sides of Upsilon Andromedae b of about 1 @,@ 400 degrees Celsiu[MASK] , ranging from minus 2[MASK] to 230 degrees to about 1 @,@ 400 to 1 @,@ 650 degrees Celsius . The temperature difference [MASK]as led to speculation that Upsilon Andromedae b is tidal locked with the sam[MASK] side always facing Upsilon Andromedae A. 
 Sudarsky had , on the assumption that the pla[MASK]et is si[MASK]ilar to Jupiter[MASK]in comp[MASK]sition and that its environment is close to c[MASK]emical equilibrium , pre[MASK]icted Upsilon Andromedae b to have[MASK]reflecti[MASK]e[MASK]clouds of silicates and iron in its upper atmosphere . T[MASK]e cloud deck instead absorbs the sun 's radiatio[MASK] ; between that and[MASK]the hot , high pressure gas surrounding the mantle , exists a stratosphere of cooler gas . The outer shell [MASK]f dark , opaque , hot cloud is[MASK]assumed to consist of vanadium and titanium oxides ( " pM planets " ) , but other compounds like tholins cannot be ruled out yet . 
 The planet i[MASK] unlikely to have large mo[MASK]ns , since tidal forces would either eject them from orbit or destroy them on short timescales compared to the age of the system . 
 The planet ( with[MASK]51 [MASK]egasi b ) was deemed a candidate for direct imaging by Plane[MASK]pol . Prelim[MASK]nary resul[MASK]s from[MASK]polarimetric studies i[MASK]dic[MASK]te that the planet has predominately blue color , is 1 @.@ 36 times [MASK]s[MASK]large and 0 @.@ 74 times as massive as Jupiter , meaning that the mean density is 0.36g / cm3 . It has a geometric a[MASK]bedo of 0 @.@ [MASK]5 in visible light . 
 
 = = Effect on its sun = = 
 
 Upsilon Andromedae b appears to be responsible for increased chromospheric activity on its parent star . Observations su[MASK]gest that there is a " hot spot " on the star around 169 ° away from the sub @-@ planetary point . This may be the result of intera[MASK]tions between the magnet[MASK]c fields of the planet and the star . The mechanism may be similar to that responsib[MASK]e for the activity[MASK]of RS Canum Venaticorum variable stars , or the interactio[MASK] between Jupite[MASK] and its moon Io .

 Daniel Jacob Radcli[MASK]fe ( born [MASK]3 July 1989 ) is an Englis[MASK] actor who rose to prominence as the title character in the Harry Potter film series . He made his acting debut at 10 years of age in BBC One 's 1999 television film David Copperfie[MASK]d , followed by his cinematic debut[MASK]in 2001 's The Tai[MASK]or of[MASK]Panama . At age 11 , he was cast as Harry Potter in the first Harry Potter fil[MASK] , and starred in the series for 10 years until the release of the eighth[MASK]and final film in 2011 . 
 Radcliffe began to branch out to stage [MASK]cting in 2007 , starring in the Londo[MASK] and New York productions of Equus , and in the 2011 Broadway revival of the musical How to Succeed in Business Without Really Trying . He starred in the 2012 horror film The Woman in Black , and played beat poet Allen Ginsberg in the 2013 indepe[MASK]dent fil[MASK] Kill Your Darlings .

 R[MASK]dcl[MASK]ffe wa[MASK] born in West Lo[MASK]don , England . He is the o[MASK]ly child of Alan George Radcliffe , a literary agent , and Marcia Jeannine Gresham ( née Marcia Gresham Jacobson [MASK] , a casting agent who was involved in several films for[MASK]the BBC , including The Inspector Lynley Mysteries and Walk Away and I S[MASK]umble . His father , who was[MASK]r[MASK]ised in Banbridge , County Down , No[MASK]thern Ireland , is from " a very working[MASK]@-@ class " Protestant background [MASK] His mother is [MASK]ewi[MASK]h , and was born in South Africa and raised in Westcliff @-@ o[MASK] @-@ Sea , Essex . Her family had originally come from Poland and Russia . Radcliffe 's parents had both acted as children . 
 In a 2[MASK]12 interview , Radcliffe stated : [MASK] There was never[MASK][MASK] religious ] faith in the house . I think o[MASK] myself as being Jewish and Irish , despite the fact that I 'm English . " He has stated : " We were Christmas tree Jews " , and that he is " very proud of being Jewish " . 
 Radcliffe first expressed a desire to act at the age of five , an[MASK] in December[MASK]1999 , aged 10 , he made his acting debut in BBC One '[MASK] televised two @-@ part[MASK]adaptation of the Charles Dickens novel David Copperfield[MASK], portraying the title character as [MASK] y[MASK][MASK]ng boy .

Attending school became difficult for Radcliffe afte[MASK] the release of th[MASK] first Har[MASK]y Potter film , with some fe[MASK]low pupils [MASK]ecoming [MASK]ostile , thoug[MASK] he says it was people just trying to " have a crack at the k[MASK]d that plays Harry Potter " rather than jealousy[MASK]. 
 [MASK]s his acting career began to consume his [MASK]chedule , Radcliffe continued his educatio[MASK] through on @-@ set tutors . He admitted he was not very good at school , considering it useless and finding the work " really difficult .

 In 2000 , producer David Heyman asked Radcliffe to audition for the role of Harry Potter for the film adaptation of Harry Potter and t[MASK]e Philosopher 's Stone , [MASK]he best @-@ selling book by British author J. K. [MASK]owling . [MASK]owling had been searching f[MASK]r an unknown British acto[MASK] to personify the character , and the movie 's director Chris Columbus recalled thinking , " This is what I want . [MASK]his is Harry Potter " , after he saw a video of the youn[MASK] actor in David Copperfield . Eight months later , and after several auditions , Radcliffe was selected to play the part . Rowling also endorsed the selection saying , " I don 't think Chris Columbus could have [MASK]ound a better Harry . " Radcliffe 's parents originally turned down the offer , as they[MASK]had been told that it would involve six films shot in Los Angeles . Warner Bros. instead offered Radcliffe a two @-@ mov[MASK]e contract with shooting in the UK ; Radcliffe was unsure at the[MASK]time if he would do any more than that . 
 The release of Harry Potter and the Philosopher 's Stone [MASK] released as [MASK]arry Potter and the Sorcerer 's Stone in the United St[MASK]tes ) took p[MASK]ace in 2001 . Radcliffe received a seven figure salary for the lead role , but asserted that the fee wa[MASK] " not that important " to him ; his parents chose to invest the money for him . The[MASK]film was highly popu[MASK]ar and was met with positive rev[MASK]ews , and critics took notice of Radcliffe : " Ra[MASK]cliffe is the embodime[MASK]t of every reader 's [MASK]maginati[MASK]n . It is wonderful to see a [MASK]oung hero who is so scholarly looking and filled[MASK]with curiosity and who connects with very real emotions , from solemn intelligence[MASK]and the deli[MASK]ht of discovery to [MASK]eep family longing , " wrote Bob Graha[MASK] of the San Francisco Chron[MASK]cle . 
 A year later Radcliffe starred in Harry Pott[MASK]r and the Chamber of Secrets , the second inst[MASK]llment of the series . Reviewers were [MASK]ositive about[MASK]the lead actors ' performances but had polarised opinions[MASK]on the movie as a whole . The 2004[MASK]release Harry Potter and the Pri[MASK]oner of Azkaban was the third film in the series . Radcliffe 's performance was panned by New Yo[MASK]k Times journalist A. O. Scott , who wrote that Watson had to carry him with her performance . Next was Harry Potter[MASK]and th[MASK] Goblet of Fire [MASK]n 2005 . The film was the second @-@ highest grossing Harry Po[MASK]ter film at that point , and Radcliffe singled out the humour as being a reason for the m[MASK]vie 's creative success . 
 The future of the franchise was put into question when Radcliffe and his co @-@ leads Emma [MASK]atson and Rupert Grint hesitated signing on to continue their[MASK]roles for the fin[MASK][MASK] two episodes ; howev[MASK]r , b[MASK] March 2007 Radcliffe had signed for the fin[MASK]l films , which[MASK]put an end to weeks of press " speculation that he would be [MASK]enied the role due to his involvement in[MASK]Equus " , in which he had perfor[MASK]ed nude on stage . [MASK]adcliffe reprised his role for the fourth time in[MASK]Harry[MASK]Potter and the[MASK]Order of the Phoenix ( 2007 ) . Radcliffe stated tha[MASK] director David Yates and actress Imelda Staunton made Order of [MASK]he Phoenix the " most fun " film in the seri[MASK][MASK] to work on . His performance[MASK]earned several a[MASK]ard nominations , and he[MASK]received the 2008 National Movie Award for " Best Male Performance . " As his fame and the series continued , Radcliffe , Grint , and Watson left imprints of the[MASK]r hands , feet , and wands in front of Grauman 's[MASK]Chinese Theatre in Hollywood . In July 2009 Ha[MASK]ry [MASK]otter and the Half @-@ Blood Prince was released , the series ' sixth instalment . Radcliffe received nominations for " Best Male Performance " and " Global Su[MASK]erstar " at the 2010 MTV Movie Awards . 
 For financial a[MASK]d scripting [MASK]easons t[MASK]e last book was divided into two films , shot back to back , whic[MASK] drew criticism from the series ' fanbase . Radcliffe defended the split , stating that i[MASK] would have been impossi[MASK]le to properly adapt the final novel into a single film . [MASK]e added that the last movie was going to be extremely fast @-@ paced with a lot of action , while the[MASK]first part would be f[MASK]r more sedate , focusing on character development ; he added that [MASK] had they combined them , those things would not have made it to the final cut . Filmi[MASK][MASK] lasted [MASK]or a year , concluding in June 2010 and on the last da[MASK][MASK]of shooting , like most of the c[MASK]st and crew , Radcliffe openly wept . 
 The final film , Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows – Part 2 , was released in July 2011 . [MASK]adcliffe , along with [MASK]he film , was critically acclaimed : Ann Hornaday of The Washington Post a[MASK]ked , " Who cou[MASK]d [MASK]ave predicted that Radcliffe , Grint and Watson would turn out[MASK]to be good actors ? " ; similarly , Rex Reed said : " Frankly , I ’ m sorry to see [ Radcliffe ] go " ; wh[MASK]le Rolling Stone critic Peter[MASK]Travers commented on Radcliffe : " Well played , sir . " Roger Ebert gave the film a highly positive review , but felt that Radcliffe , Grint and Watson were " upstaged by the supporting [ a[MASK]tors ] . " 
 Radcliffe admitted[MASK]that so[MASK]e people would never be able to[MASK]separate him from the character , but also said he is " proud to be associated with this film series fore[MASK]er . " Despite positive f[MASK]elings about the movies , he has no interest in doing more Harr[MASK] Potter films . After Rowling hinted about writing an eighth book , Radcliffe was asked if he wo[MASK]ld do another film to which he replied : " [ It is ] very doubtful . I think 10 years is a long time to spen[MASK] with on[MASK] character . " Despite devoting so much time to the series , Radcliffe has asserted that he[MASK]did not miss out on a childhood like ot[MASK]er child actors : " I ’ ve been given [MASK] much better perspective on life by doing Potter . "

 Radcli[MASK]fe[MASK]made his film debut in The Tailor of Panama , an American 2001 film based on John le C[MASK]rré 's 1996 spy novel , [MASK]n[MASK] a moderate commercial success . In 2002 he made his[MASK]stage debut as a celebrity guest in a West End theatre pro[MASK]uction of The Play What I Wrote , directed by Kenneth Branagh – who also[MASK]appeared with him in the second Harry Potter film . In 2[MASK]07 he app[MASK]ared in the film December Boy[MASK] , an Australian family drama about[MASK]four orphans that was shot in 2005 an[MASK] released to theatres[MASK]in mid @-@ September 2007 . Also in 2007 , Radcliffe co @-@ starred with Carey Mulligan in My Boy Jack , a television drama film shown on ITV on Remembrance Day . The fil[MASK] received mostly positive reviews , with sev[MASK]ral critics praising Radcliffe 's performance as an 18 @-@ year @-@ old who goes missing in action during a battle . Ra[MASK]cliffe stated , " For many people [MASK]y age , the First World War is just a topic in [MASK] history book . But I[MASK]'ve always been fascinated b[MASK] the subject and think it [MASK]s as relevant today as it ever was . " 
 At age 17 , in a bid to show people h[MASK] was prepared for adult roles , he performed [MASK]nstage in[MASK]Peter Shaffer 's play Equus , which had n[MASK]t been revived since its first run in 1973 , at[MASK]the Gielgud Theatre . Radcliffe took [MASK]n the lead role as Alan Strang , a stable boy who has an obsession with h[MASK]rses . [MASK]dvance sales topped £ 1 @.@ 7 million , and the role generated significant pre @-@ opening media interest , as Radcliffe appeared in a nude scene . Equus opened on 27 February 2007 and ran until 9 June 2007 . Radcliffe 's performance received positive reviews as critics were impressed by the nuance and depth of his against @-@ type role . Charles S[MASK]encer of The Daily Telegraph wrote that he " disp[MASK]ays a dramat[MASK]c power and an electrifying stage presence that marks a trem[MASK]ndous leap f[MASK]rward . " He add[MASK]d : " I never thought I would find the diminutive ( but perfectly formed ) Radcliffe a sinister figure , but as Alan Strang ... there are moments when he seems genuinely scary in his r[MASK]ge and confusion . " Th[MASK] production then transferred to Broadway in September 2008 , with Radcliffe [MASK]till in the lead role . Radcliffe stated he was nervous about repeating the role on Broadway because h[MASK] considered American audiences more discerning than those in London . Radcliffe 's performa[MASK]ce was nominated for a Drama Desk Award .

Other cas[MASK] members included Joh[MASK] Larroquette , Rose H[MASK]mingway and Mary Faber . Both the actor and production received favourable reviews , with USA[MASK]Today commenting : " Radcliffe u[MASK]timately succeeds not by overshadowing his fellow cast members , but by working in conscientious harmony with them – and havi[MASK]g a blast in th[MASK] process . " Radcliffe 's performance in the show earned him Drama Desk Award , Drama League Award and Outer Critics Circle Award nominations . The production [MASK]tself later received nine Tony Award nominations . Radcliffe left the show on 1 January 2012 .[MASK]
 His first post @-@ Harry Potter project was the 2012 horr[MASK]r film The Woman in Black , adapted from the 1983 novel by Sus[MASK]n Hill . The film was released on[MASK][MASK] February 2012 in the United States and Canada , and was released on 10 February in the UK . Radcliffe portrays a man sent to deal with the legal matters of a mysterious woman who has just died , and soon after he [MASK]egins to experience [MASK]trange events [MASK]nd hauntings from the ghost of a woman d[MASK]e[MASK]sed in black . He has said he was " i[MASK]credibly excited " to be part of the film and described the script as " bea[MASK]tifully written " .[MASK]
 In 2013 , he portrayed [MASK]merican poet [MASK]llen Ginsberg in the thriller drama Kill Your Darlings [MASK] directed by John Krokidas . He also starr[MASK]d in an Irish @-@ Canadian romantic comed[MASK] film The F Word directed by Michael Dowseand written by Elan Mastai , based [MASK]n TJ Dawe and Michael Rinaldi 's play [MASK]oothpaste and Cigars and then he starred in an Amer[MASK]can dark fanta[MASK]y horror film directed by Alexandre Aja Horns[MASK]. Both of the films premie[MASK]ed at the 38th Toront[MASK] International Film Festival . 
 Radcliffe also perform[MASK]d at the Noël Coward Theatre in the stage play revival of Martin McDonagh 's dark comedy The Cripple of Inishmaan as the le[MASK]d , Billy Claven , for which he won the WhatsOnSta[MASK]e Award for Best Actor i[MASK] a Play . In[MASK]2015 , Radcliffe [MASK]tarred as Igor in a science fiction horror film [MASK][MASK]ctor Frankenstein directed by P[MASK]ul McGuigan and written by Max Landis , which was based on contemporary adaptations of Mary Shelley 's 1[MASK]18 novel Frankenstein . In 2016 , Radcliffe portrayed Manny , a talkative corpse , in the indie film Swiss Army Ma[MASK] . 
 [MASK]e is set to star as American reporter Jake Adelstein in Tokyo Vice .

 In 2008 , Radcliffe [MASK]evealed that he has a mild form of the neurological disord[MASK]r developmental coordination disorder . The motor skill disorder sometimes prevents him from doing simple act[MASK]vities , [MASK]uch as writing or tying his own shoelace[MASK] . " I w[MASK]s having a hard time at schoo[MASK] , [MASK]n terms of being cra[MASK] at everything , with [MASK]o discernible talent , "[MASK]Radcliffe commented . In August 2010 , he stopped drinking alcohol after fi[MASK]ding himself becoming too reliant on it . 
 In November 2007 Radcliffe pub[MASK]ished several poems under the pen name Jacob Gershon – a combination of his middle name and the Jewish version of his mother 's maide[MASK] name Gresham – in Rubbish , an underground[MASK]fashion ma[MASK]azine . He has a close friendship with his Harry Potter co @-@ stars Tom Felton and Emma Watson , and is tight @-@ knit with his family , whom he credits for keeping him grounded . 
 Sources disagree about Rad[MASK]liffe 's pers[MASK]nal wealth ; he was reported to have earned £ 1 million for the first Harry Potter film and a[MASK]ound £[MASK]15 mi[MASK]lion for the s[MASK][MASK]th . Radcliffe appeared on the Sunday Times Rich List in 2006 , whic[MASK] estimated his personal fortune to b[MASK] £ 14 [MASK]illion , making him one of the rich[MASK]st young p[MASK]ople in th[MASK] UK . In March 2009 he was ranked number one on t[MASK]e Forbes " Mos[MASK] Valuable Young Stars " list , and by April The Daily Telegraph measured his net worth at £ 30m , mak[MASK]ng him the 12th richest young perso[MASK] in the UK . Radcliffe was co[MASK]sidered to be the richest teenager in England lat[MASK]r that year . In February 2010 he was named the sixth highest paid Hollywood male star and placed at number five on Forbes 's December list of Hollywood 's highest @-@ g[MASK]ossing actors with a film revenue o[MASK] US $ 780 million , mainly due to Harr[MASK] Potter and the Deathly Hallows [MASK]eing released that year .

 " ... Thirteen Years Later " proved a difficult episode to produce , with filming req[MASK]iring a large number of shots to be completed and the script to be adjusted on short notic[MASK] .

 Federal Bureau of Investigat[MASK][MASK]n agents Frank Black[MASK]( Lance Henriksen ) and Emm[MASK] Hollis ( Klea Scott ) travel[MASK]to Travelers Rest [MASK] South Carolina to investigate the deaths of film director Lew Carroll ( Paul Stanl[MASK]y ) and Marta [MASK]anbury , the leading actress in his newest film . As the local sheriff guides Black and Hollis through the mur[MASK]er scene , Black realizes that the film is based on a real murder case he investig[MASK]ted thirteen years previously ; he is shocked to learn that the true st[MASK]ry [MASK]s being sensationalized for the screen . 
 The pair in[MASK]erview the cast and crew as suspects , dis[MASK]overing that many [MASK]ould benefi[MASK] from either of the deaths — producer Kenny Neiderman had bee[MASK] having an affair with Danbury ; Rowdy Beeman replaced Carroll as director ; Rub[MASK] Dahl and Ramona Tangent , whose roles in the film will expand wit[MASK]out Danbury ; and Mark Bianco , a method actor relishing the opportunity to meet Black , whose role he plays .

 " ... Thirteen Years Later " is the second episode of Millennium to have been written by Michael R. Perry , who had previously penned the second season episode " The[MASK][MASK]ikado " , and would provide a further three scripts in the third seaso[MASK][MASK]. The episode was directed by Thomas J. Wright , who helmed a total of twenty @-@ six episodes across all three seasons . Wright would also go on to direct[MASK]" Millennium " , the series ' crossover episode with its sister show The X @-@ Files . 
 The episode features guest appearances by the members of the band Kiss — Peter Criss , Ace [MASK]rehle[MASK] , Gene Simmons and Paul Stanley —[MASK]who each portray bot[MASK] themselves and a sm[MASK]ll cam[MASK]o role . However , the band members[MASK]insisted dur[MASK]ng filming that the[MASK]r roles be[MASK]given an equal amount of dialogue , which led to Perry being asked to amend scenes on short notice and fax updated scripts to the shooting locations ; ultimately m[MASK]c[MASK] of this additional material was filmed but not used in the episode . Ace Frehley was also [MASK]n[MASK]nt[MASK][MASK]siastic towards his role[MASK], and requested to play a " 300 @-@ pound black man " instead , wishing to w[MASK]ar a fat suit like those used in the 1996 Eddie Murphy film The Nutty Professor ; he was eventually convinced that such a suit would take too long to fabricate . 
 Perry has descr[MASK]bed the production " ... Thirteen Ye[MASK]rs Later " as being " one of the most gruelling " of the series ' r[MASK]n , citing [MASK]ts abundance [MASK]f stunt work and physical effects as the cause of this . Perry praised Wright for his ability to direct the episode within the usual tim[MASK] con[MASK]traints , as he felt the number of shots involved was more akin to a feature[MASK][MASK]ilm than a television episode . Gu[MASK]st star Jeff Yaghe[MASK] , who played killer Mark Bianco , is [MASK]he husba[MASK]d of actress Megan Gallagher , who star[MASK]ed in the first two seasons of Millennium as Black 's wife Catherine .

 Route 29 is [MASK] state highway in the[MASK]U.S. state of New Jersey . It runs 34 @.@ 76 mi ( 55 @.@ [MASK]4 km ) from an interchange with Interstate 295 ( I @-@ 295 ) in Hamilton Township in Mercer County , where it continues as I @-@ 195 , to R[MASK]ute 12 ( Bridge Stre[MASK]t / Race Street ) in Frenchtown , Hunterdon County . Between the southern terminus [MASK]nd I @-@ 95 ,[MASK]the route is a mix o[MASK] freeway and four @-@ lane divided h[MASK]ghway that runs along the Delaware Ri[MASK]er through Trenton . This sect[MASK]on includes a truck @[MASK]@ restricted tunnel that was built along the river near his[MASK]oric houses and Riverview Cemetery . North of I @-@ 95 , Route 29 turns into a scenic an[MASK] mostly two @-@ lane highway . Nort[MASK] of the South Trenton Tunnel , it is designated the Delaware River [MASK]cenic Byway , a New Jersey Scenic Byway and National Scenic Byway , that follows the D[MASK]laware River in mostly rural sections of Mercer County and Hunterdon County . The obsolete Delawar[MASK] & Raritan Canal usually stands between the river and the highway . Mo[MASK]t [MASK]ections of this portion of Route 29 are completely shaded due to the tree canopy . Route 29 also has a spur , Route 129 , which co[MASK]nects Route 29 to U.S. Route 1 ( US 1 ) in Trenton . 
 Route 29 was initially designated in 1927 to run from downtown Trenton t[MASK] Newark , following present @-[MASK] day Route[MASK]179 and US 202 between Lambertville and Somerville and US 22 between Some[MASK]ville and Newark . The route [MASK]etween Lambertville and Frenchtown was originally Route 29A . In 1953 , Route 2[MASK] was shifted to follow the alignment of Route 29A [MASK]o a[MASK]oid the concurrencies wi[MASK]h the U.S. Routes . Route 29 between South Warren S[MASK]reet in Trenton and I @-@ 95 in Ewing[MASK]Townshi[MASK] was upgraded to a four @-@ lane highway , with a portion of freeway , in the 1950s and 1960[MASK] . In 1995 , the southern freeway part of Route 29 between I @-@ 195 / I[MASK]@-@ 295 and Route 129 in Hamilton Township was com[MASK]leted . This freeway section was linked to the rest of Route 29 by a tunnel completed in 2002 .

 = = History = = 
 
 The current route was originally legislated in 1911 as p[MASK]rt of the Delaware River Drive , a n[MASK]med state highway that was proposed to run from along the Delaware River from Trenton to[MASK]the New York border in Montague Township . R[MASK]ute 29 was originally defined in 1927 to run from Trenton to Newark . The original route ra[MASK] from downtown Trenton along State Street and Sanhican Drive . From there , it followed its current alignment to Lambertville , where it followed present @-@ day Route 179 to Ringoes to present @-@ da[MASK] County Route 514 , which it followed to Woods Tave[MASK]n . The route turned north on U.S. Route 206 ( also designated Route 31 ) and followed that route to Somerville , wh[MASK]re it followed[MASK]U.S. Route 22 to Newark . The current alignment of Rou[MASK]e 29 from Lambertville to Route 12 in Frenchtown was designated Route 29A in [MASK]927 . 
 The alignment of Route 29 between Ringoes and Somerville [MASK]as eventually shifted to follo[MASK] present @-@ day U.S. Route 202 , which was also Route 30 ( now Route 31 ) between Ringoes and Flemington and Route 12 betwee[MASK] Fl[MASK]mington and Somerville . In 1938 , Route 29B was planned as an extension of Route 29A from Frenchtown to Route 28 ( now Route 122 ) in Alpha . While this road was never built , much of the alignment north of Milford is served by County Route [MASK]19 . In 1948 , a spur route , Route S29 , was created , running along U.S. Route 202 ( Bridge Street ) in Lambertville to the New Hope @-@ Lambertville Bridge . In the 1[MASK]53 New Jersey state highway renumbering , Route 29 was redefined to [MASK]ontinue north from Lambertville to Frenchtown on Route 29A , and the Route 29 designation between Lambertville and N[MASK]wark was removed in favor of U.S. Route 202 betw[MASK]en Lambertville[MASK]and Somerville and U.S. Route 22 between Somerville and Newark . The section of former Route 29 between Route 29A and Route S29 became Route [MASK]65 . 
 Plans for a limited @-@ access route along the Route 29 corridor go back to 1932 , when a parkway[MASK]was proposed along the Delaware River between Trenton and L[MASK]mbertville ; this proposal never materialized . Plans for a freeway were resurrected in the early 1950[MASK] to construct a road , the John Fitch Park[MASK]ay , that was to run from Hami[MASK]ton Township to Interstate [MASK]5 in Ewing Township . [MASK]his road was bui[MASK]t between [MASK]954 and 1957 from South Warren Street in Trento[MASK] to present @-@ day Interstate 95 in Ewing Township . Construction of this portion John Fitch Parkway took up much of Trenton ’ s [MASK]va[MASK]lable waterfront along the Delaware River . The former alignment of Route 29 in the nort[MASK]ern part of Trenton and in Ewing Town[MASK]hip became Route 175 . 
 Between 1990 and 1995 , the Rout[MASK] 29 freeway was built between the Interstate 195 / Interstate 295 interchange and Route 129 in Hamilton Town[MASK]hip . A two @-@ lane street , Lamberton Road , connected the two freeway sections . Plans were then made to fill the gap between the two freeway sections in Trenton . Construction began in 1997 on the Route 29 fr[MASK]eway between Rou[MASK]e 129 and the Morrisv[MASK]lle @-@ Trenton Railroad Bridge . The road was to include two traffic lights at Cass Street and South Warren Street and a tunnel which was to be built as a covered roadway on the bank of the Delaware River . The tu[MASK]nel was originally schedul[MASK]d to be complete by [MASK]001 but was delayed[MASK]after the Army Corps of Engineer[MASK] discovered many environmental violations[MASK]that occurred with construction of the tunnel .[MASK]The roof w[MASK]s put in place in October 2001 and the tunnel of[MASK]icially opene[MASK] to traffic on March 2 [MASK] 2002 . A restriction to trucks over[MASK]13 tons was put in place and made permanent in November 2002 . 
 By the 2000s , the[MASK]state gave the part of Route 29 ( South Main Street ) between Route 165 and Route 179 in Lambertville to the city , and Ro[MASK]te 29 was rerouted to use a[MASK]l of Route 165 and one block of Route 179 . [MASK]rior to this , South Main Street had been turned one @-@ way southbound . Route 165 , which is only signed on overhead street signs , still exists , though it is fully concurrent with Route 29 .

 The[MASK]first Mongol [MASK]nvasions of[MASK]Burma ( Myanmar ) ( Burmese : မွန ် ဂို – မြန ် မာ စစ ် ( ၁၂၇၇ – ၁၂၈၇ ) )[MASK][MASK]ere a series o[MASK] military[MASK]conflicts between Kubl[MASK]i Khan 's [MASK]uan dynasty , division of the Mongol Empire , and the Pagan Empire that took place between 1277 and 1287 . The invasions toppled the 250 @-@ year @-@ old Pagan Empire , and the Mongol army seized Pagan te[MASK]ri[MASK]ories in prese[MASK]t @-@ day Dehong , Yunnan and northern Burma to Tagaung . The invasions ushered in 250 ye[MASK]rs of political fragmentation in Burma and the[MASK]rise of Tai @-@ [MASK]han states throughout mainland Southeast Asia . 
 [MASK]he Mongols fir[MASK]t demanded tribute from Pagan in 1271 – 72 , as part of their drive to encircle the Song dynasty of China . When King Narathihapate refused , Emperor Kublai Khan himself sent another mission in 1273[MASK], again demanding tribute . It too was rejected . In 1275 , the emperor ordered the Yunnan government to s[MASK]cure the border[MASK]an[MASK]s in order to block an escape path for the Song ,[MASK]and permitted a limite[MASK] border war if Pagan contested . Pagan did contest but i[MASK]s army was driven back at [MASK]he frontier[MASK]by the Mongol Army in 1277 – 78 . Af[MASK]er a brief lull , Kublai [MASK]han in 1281 turned his attention to Southeast Asia , demanding tribute from Pagan , the Khmer Empire , Đại Việt and Champa . When the B[MASK]rmese king again refus[MASK]d , the emperor ordered an invasion of northern Burma . Two dry se[MASK]son campaigns ( 1283 – 85 ) later , the Mongols[MASK]had occupied down to Taga[MASK]ng and Hanlin[MASK], forcing the Burmese king to flee to Low[MASK]r Burma . The Mongols organized northern Burma as the province of Zhengmian . 
 Ceasefire negotiations began in 1285 , and ended with Narathihapate[MASK]finally agreeing to submi[MASK] in June 1286 . The Burmese embassy , received by the emperor in Beijing in January [MASK]287 , agreed to a treaty that acknowledged [MASK]he suz[MASK]rainty of the Yuan dynasty or the Mongol Empire over the Pagan Empire and annual payments in taxes to the Yunnan government in [MASK]xchange for the evacuation of[MASK]Mongol troops from northern Burma . But the treaty never really took effect as Narathihapate was assassin[MASK]ted in July 1[MASK]87 , and no authority who could honor the treaty emerged . The Mongol command at Yunnan now deemed the imperial order[MASK]to withdraw[MASK]void , and ordered an invasion of central Burma . They may not have reached Pa[MASK]an , and even if they did , a[MASK]ter having suffered heavy [MASK]asualties , they returned to Tagaung . 
 Th[MASK] Pagan Empire disintegrated and an[MASK]rchy ensued . The Mongols , who probably preferred the[MASK]situation , did nothing to restore order in the next ten years . In Mar[MASK]h 1297 , they accepted the voluntary submission of King Kyawswa of Pagan although he control[MASK]ed little beyond the capital city of Pagan ( Bagan ) . But Kyawswa was overthrown nine months later ,[MASK]and the Mongols were forced to intervene , leading to their second invasio[MASK] i[MASK] 1300 – 01 . 
 Marco Polo reported the first invasions ( 1277 – 87 ) in his travelog[MASK]e , Il Milione . The Burmese referr[MASK]d to the invaders as the Taruk ( after the central Asian Turkic tr[MASK]ops that largely made up the Mongol invasion[MASK]army ) ; today , the term[MASK]Taruk ( တရုတ ် ) refers to the Han Chinese instead .

 = = = Pagan and Dali = = = 
 
 In the 13th century[MASK], the Pagan Empire , along with the Khmer Empire [MASK] was one of the two main empires in mainland Southeast Asia . For much of its history , Pagan 's neighbor to the northeast was not China but the independent Dali Kingdom and its predecessor Nanzhao , both with Dali as their capital city . Dali @-@ based kingdoms were a power[MASK]in their own right , at times allying themselves with the Tibetan Empire to their [MASK]est and at other time[MASK] wit[MASK] China 's Tang and Song dynasties . Ind[MASK]ed , Nanzhao 's mounted armies ve[MASK]tured deep into what is today Burma and may have been behi[MASK]d the founding of th[MASK] medieval city of [MASK]agan and the Pagan Dynasty itself . 
 Between the newly conquered Mongol territory and Pagan were a wide swat[MASK] of borderlands stretching from present @-@ day Dehong , Baoshan and Lincang prefectures in Yunnan as well as [MASK]he Wa and Palaung regions ( presumably in present @-@ day northern [MASK]han State ) , which Pagan and Dali had both claimed and exercised overlapping spheres of influence . Then as now , the borderlands mostly consist of forbidding terrains of high mount[MASK]in ranges . 
 
[MASK]= = = Mongol conquest of Dal[MASK] = = = 
 
 The Mongol Empire first arrived at the doorstep of the Pagan Empire in 1252 by invading the Dali Kingdom in its attempt to outflank Song China . The Mongol armies captured the capital , Dali , on 7 January 1253 , and wen[MASK] on to pacify much of the kingdom by 1257 . 
 The arrival of the Mongols did not initially upset the existing order at the borderlands as the Mongols were intent o[MASK] finishing off[MASK]the Song . For the next dozen years , they consolidated their hold over the newly conquered land , which not only provide[MASK] them with a base from which to attack the Song from the rear but also w[MASK]s strate[MASK]ically located on the trade route[MASK] from China to Burma and India . The Mongols set up military garrisons , mann[MASK]d mostly by Turkic @-@ speaking Muslims from Central Asia [MASK] in 37 ci[MASK]cui[MASK]s[MASK]of the form[MASK]r[MASK]Dali Kingdom .

 By then , the Pagan Empire , despite o[MASK]tward appearances of calm , had b[MASK]en in long an[MASK] slow decline since the [MASK]arly 13th century . The continuous growth of tax @-@ free[MASK]religious wealth [MASK]ad greatly reduced the tax base of the kingdom . The crown had lost resources needed to retain the loyalty of courtiers [MASK]nd military servicemen , inviting a vicious circle of internal disor[MASK]ers and external challenges . Although it was able to put down the f[MASK]rst batch of serious rebellions in 1258 – 60 in [MASK]outh Arakan and Martaban[MASK]( Mottama ) , the decline continued . On the eve of the Mongol invasions , be[MASK]ween one[MASK]and two @-@ thirds of Upper Burma '[MASK] cultivable land had been donated to relig[MASK]on . The crown 's ability to mobilize defenses was in serious jeopardy .

 [MASK]he period of c[MASK]lm for Pagan ended in the early 1270s . By then , the Song were on the ro[MASK]es , and Em[MASK]eror Kublai Khan , who officially founded the Yuan dynasty on 18 December 1271 , sought to cut off th[MASK] retreat of Song refugees in all[MASK]direct[MASK]ons . In Pagan 's case , he had ordered[MASK]the [MASK]ongol governor of Dali to tighte[MASK] control of th[MASK] borderlands , and [MASK]n January 1271 to send a mission [MASK]o [MASK]agan to demand tribute . The tribute he demanded was nominal . Given his higher priority preoccupations elsewhere , the emperor was not looking to repl[MASK]ce the regime at Pagan . At the border , the ruler of the Wa and Palaung region[MASK] submitted to the Mongols . 
 When the Mo[MASK]gol[MASK]envoys led by Qidai Tuoyin showed up , the Pagan court led by Chief Minister Ananda Pyissi was well aware of the military power of the Mongols and advised King Narathihapate to use diplomacy . The ki[MASK]g was furious at the demand and ke[MASK]t t[MASK]e Mongol envoys waiting for weeks . The court finally devised a compromise : the[MASK]envoys[MASK]were sent back without ever seeing the king[MASK][MASK] Accompanying them was a Burmese envoy who carried a letter expressing fri[MASK]ndly sentiments and the [MASK]urmese king 's wish to one day worship a Buddha tooth at Beijing . The king then promptly ordered an expediti[MASK]n , which retook the rebellious borderland [MASK]egions in April 1272 . The rebel le[MASK]der A @[MASK]@ Pi ( အပိ ) was brought back to Pagan . Dali relayed the news to Beijing but [MASK]id not carry out any milit[MASK]ry[MASK]acti[MASK]n .

 At Beijing , Kublai Khan , who[MASK]was preparing an invasion of Japan , de[MASK]ided again[MASK]t a war with Pagan — for the time being . On 3 March 1273 , he sent [MASK] 4 @-[MASK] member d[MASK]legation led by an imperial ambassador , the First[MASK]Secretary to the Board Rites , to Pagan . The delegation carried a letter from the emperor . Th[MASK] [MASK]et[MASK]er says : 
 " If you have finally decided to fulfill your du[MASK]ies towards the All [MASK]-@ Highest , send one of your brothers or senior ministers [MASK] to show men that all the world is linked with U[MASK] , and enter into a perpetual alliance . This will add to your reputation , and be in your own interests ; for if it com[MASK]s to war , who will be the victor ? Ponder w[MASK]ll , O king , Our words . " 
 This time , the Burmese k[MASK]ng received the imperial envoys b[MASK]t still refused to sub[MASK]it . ( [MASK]he Burmese chronicles say that the king was so insult[MASK]d that he had th[MASK] envoys executed . But both Burm[MASK]se inscriptional evidence and Yuan records indicate that the envoys were not executed . ) At any rate , the imperial envoys did not get back to Yun[MASK]an in due time . The newly formed Yunnan g[MASK]vernment sent another delegation to inve[MASK]tigate the whereabouts of the delegation , but the delegation could not reach Pagan because of an ongoin[MASK] rebellion en [MASK]oute .

 Meanw[MASK]ile , in 1274 , the former Dali Kingd[MASK]m was officially reorganized as the Province of [MASK]unnan , with Sayyid Ajjal Shams[MASK]al @-@ Din Omar a[MASK] governor . In May 1275 , the governor sent a report to the emperor stating that the em[MASK]assy had not returned ; that the Burmese evidently had no intention of submitting ; and[MASK]tha[MASK] war was the[MASK]only way forward . 
 But th[MASK] emperor rejected an outright invasion . Just coming off a disastrous Japanese campaign , the emperor was unwilling to commit the central [MASK]overnment troops to[MASK]what he considered a[MASK]low priority affair . He was now focu[MASK]ed on delivering the final blow against the Song ; the emperor ordered the Yunnan provincial army to s[MASK]cure the borderlands in order[MASK]to block the escape path of the Song refugees . H[MASK] also sanctioned a limited border war if P[MASK]gan contested the takeover . As planned , the Yunnan army proceede[MASK] to consoli[MASK]ate the borderlands in 1275 – 76 . ( Els[MASK]w[MASK]ere , the main Mongol armies had captured most of the Song territory by 1276 . ) 
 By 1277 , at least one Burmese vassal sta[MASK]e named " Gold Teeth " ( modern Yingjiang ) had submitted to the Mongols [MASK] Like in 1272 , the Burmese government responded by sending an army to [MASK]eclaim the rebellious state ; but un[MASK]ike in 1[MASK]72 , the Mongo[MASK]s had posted a sizable garrison there . Though it was ultimately under Mon[MASK]ol c[MASK]mmand , many of the officers and most of the soldiers of the garrison were Turkic @-@ speaking peoples or people from the further [MASK]est : [MASK]urks from Samarkand , Bukhara , Merv and Nishapur , but also captive soldiers from the Persian Khwarazmid empire , the Kipchaks , and even Bulgars from the lower Volga .

 What followed was a border war in 1277 – 78 . It was repor[MASK]ed mainly in the Yuan dynasty chronicle and the travelogue of Marco Polo . Although the B[MASK]rmese chronicles have no record of the border war , a 1278 Burmese inscript[MASK]on mentions the army 's defeat at Ngasaunggyan . The Mongol accounts of the border war contain certain errors of location and numb[MASK]rs although the overall narrative is probably accurate . 
 
 = = = Battle of Ngasaunggyan = = = 
 
 According to the Yuan dynasty chronicle and Marco Polo 's accounts , a Burmese army " invaded " the Mongol territory of Gold Teeth , and was defeated by the Mongol army in April 1277 . The battle took place either at [MASK]he Vochang valley ( in pre[MASK]e[MASK]t @-@ day[MASK]Baoshan Prefecture ) or 110 km southwest at Kanngai ( present @-@ day Yingjiang , Dehong [MASK]refecture ) , [MASK]hich the Burmese called Ngasaun[MASK][MASK]yan . 
 The Yuan Ch[MASK]onicle reports that only 700 men defeated a Burmese army of 40 @,@ 000 to 50 @,@ 000 with 10 @,@ 000 horses and 800 elephants . It also reports o[MASK]ly one Mongol was kille[MASK] , in tryi[MASK]g to catch an elephant . According to Marco Polo , the Mongol army consisted of 12 @,@ 000 mounted archers , and the Burmese army number[MASK]d 60 @,@ 000 me[MASK] with 2000[MASK]elephants , " on each of which was set a tower of timber , well @-@ frame[MASK] and strong , and carryin[MASK] from 12 to[MASK]16 well @-@ armed fighting men . " Even then , the 40 @,@ 000 to 60 @,@ 000 figures of the Bur[MASK]ese army strength were likely eye estimates and may still be too hig[MASK] ; the Mongols may have erred " on the side of generosity " not to " diminish their glory in defeating superi[MASK][MASK] numbers . " 
 According to Marco Polo 's account ,[MASK]in the early stages of the batt[MASK]e , the Turkish and[MASK]Mongol horsemen " to[MASK]k such fright at the sight of the elephants that they would not be got to face the foe , but always swerved and turned back , " while the Bur[MASK]ese forces pressed on . But the Mongol commander Huthukh did not panic ; he ordered his troops [MASK]o dismount , and from the cover of the nearby treeline , aim their bows directly at the advancing elephants . The Mongol ar[MASK]hers ' arrows threw the animals into such pai[MASK] that they fled .

 The Mongol army pressed on after the monsoon sea[MASK]on . In the following dry season of 1277 – 78 , c . Dec[MASK]mber 1277 , a Mongol army of 3800 led by Nasr al @-@ Din , son of Gov. Sayyid Ajjal , advanced to Kaungsin , which defended the B[MASK]amo Pass . They occupied the fort and destroyed a larg[MASK] number of abandoned stockades . But they found the heat excessive and returned . 
 
 = = Interlude ( 1278 – [MASK]3 ) = = 
 
 Despite the Mongol military success , the control of the borderla[MASK]ds remained contested . Pagan [MASK]id not relinquish its cla[MASK]m to the frontier regions , an[MASK] the Burmese , app[MASK]rently taking advantage of Mongol preoccupations elsewhere , rebuilt their forts at Kaungsin and Ngasaunggyan later in 1278 , posting permanent garrisons commanded by Einda Py[MASK]ssi . But their co[MASK]trol was short @-@ lived . The Grea[MASK] Khan 's attention turned to Southeast Asia once more in 1281 . He ha[MASK] had mixed success : his vaunted[MASK]forces had fi[MASK]ished off the last of the Song in 1279 but had again failed to take Japan in 1281 . That year , the Mongol emperor sen[MASK] anothe[MASK] mission to[MASK]Pagan , demanding tribute yet again . T[MASK]e Burmese king was to send his ten senior ministers accompanied by one thousand cavalry officers to the emperor 's court . ( With Champa , the emperor summoned the king of Champa himself to Beijing . ) 
 At Pagan , Narathihapate[MASK]de[MASK]ibera[MASK]ed with his c[MASK]urt for an appropriate response but ultimately ref[MASK]sed to submit . The Burmese court may have been counting on another limited border war but the emperor now ordered an invasion of nort[MASK]ern Burma . ( He also ordered an invasion [MASK]f Champa , whose king too had refu[MASK]ed to submit . ) The Burmese king 's troubles did not go unnot[MASK]ced[MASK]elsew[MASK]ere in the kingdom . In the same year , a usurper named Wareru seized[MASK]the southern port city of Martaban ( Mottama ) by killing its Pagan @-@ appointed govern[MASK]r . Although the king 's three sons were vicer[MASK]ys of the nearby[MASK]Lower Burma cities ( in Bassein ( Pathein ) , Pro[MASK]e ( Pyay ) , and Dala ) , the king , preoccupied with much more serious threat in the north , did not ( or could not ) take any actio[MASK] on Martaban . 
 Throughout 1282 , the Mongol command[MASK]mad[MASK] preparations for the upcoming invasions of Champa and northern B[MASK]rma . The objective of the Burma campaign was to t[MASK]ke over northern Burma but no further ; the emperor did not sanction an attack on Pagan itself . At least one army consisted of 14 @[MASK]@ 000 men of the erstwhile Persian Khwarezmid [MASK]mpire under the command of Yalu Beg was sen[MASK] to Yunnan [MASK]o reinforce the Bu[MASK]ma invasion force , [MASK]hich again was made [MASK]p of Turks and other central Asians . On the Burmese side , the king ma[MASK]aged to r[MASK]ise an [MASK]rmy although giv[MASK]n his low standing with his vassals , he probably could not have raised a large one . By mid @-@ 1283 , a Burmese army led by generals Ananda Pyissi and Yanda Pyissi was deployed at a fort at Ngasaunggyan .

 The invasion began on 22 September 1283 . Prince Sangqudar was the commander @-@ in @-@ chief of the invasion force ; his deputies were Vice Governor Taipn , and commander Yagan[MASK]Tegin . T[MASK]e Mongol armies marched to the border in two columns .

( The chronicles say that the Burmese army numbered 400 @,@ 000 men while the [MASK]ongol army numbered 20 million men and 6 million horses . ) The Burmese withstood the siege for over two months but the fort fell on 3 December 1283 .[MASK]
 
 = = = Invasion of northern Burma = = = 
 
 The defeat at Ngasaunggyan broke the[MASK]back of[MASK]Burmese defenses . The Burmese army lost several t[MASK]ousand men as well [MASK]s sen[MASK]or commanders . Kaungsin ,[MASK]the next fort inline , fell just six days later on 9 December 1283 . The Mongol sourc[MASK]s say that the B[MASK]rmese los[MASK] 10 @,@ 000 men at Kaungsin . The Mongol armies pushed farther south i[MASK]to the Irrawaddy valley . They took the ancient Burmese capital of Tagaung , about 380 km north of Pagan on 5 February 1284 . Th[MASK]re , the invaders paused their adv[MASK]nce . They found the heat of t[MASK]e searing Irrawaddy valley excessive , and ev[MASK]cuated Tagaung , allowing the Burme[MASK]e to return to Tagaung on 10 May 1284 . But the Mongol army renewed their offensive in the following dry season . They re[MASK]ook Tagaung , and defeated an[MASK]ther Burme[MASK]e[MASK]stand south of Tagaung , probably near Hanlin , on 26 January 1285 , opening the way to Pagan , about 270 km south . After[MASK]the defeat , the king panicked , and fled to Lower Burma . The evacuation pr[MASK]ved premature . The M[MASK]ngol forces did not[MASK]advance on Pagan as it was not part of their invasion plan . 
 The country fel[MASK] in[MASK]o chaos . In Lower Burma , the king found himself isolated , let alone[MASK]pla[MASK] a counterattack . Although his sons ruled the key Lower Burma ports ( Prome , Dala and Bassein ) , the king did not trust any of the[MASK] , and he and his court settled at Hlegya , west of [MASK]rome . Without the[MASK]full support of his s[MASK]ns , the presence of the king and his small ar[MASK]y impressed no one . The governor of Pegu revolted that same year . The king managed to send two small expeditions to Pegu but they both fa[MASK]led . Now , the entire eastern half of Lower Burma ( Pegu and Martaban ) was in open revolt .

 Given his[MASK][MASK]recarious position , Narathihapate decided to[MASK]buy time , and sue for peace with the Mo[MASK]gols . In November /[MASK]December 1285 , the king ordered his gener[MASK]ls Ananda Pyis[MASK]i and Maha Bo to enter into ceas[MASK]fire [MASK]egotiations . The Mongol commanders at Hanlin , who had organized northern Burma as a protectorate named Zhengmian ( Chine[MASK]e : 征緬 ; Wade – Giles : Cheng @-@ Mien ) , agreed to a ceasefire but ins[MASK]sted on a full submission . They repeated their 1281 demand that the Burmese king s[MASK]nd a [MASK]ormal delegation to [MASK]he emperor . [MASK]he two sides had reached [MASK] tentative agreeme[MASK]t by 3 March 1286 , which calls for a full submission of th[MASK] Pagan Empire , and central Burma to be organized as the province of Mianzhong ( Chinese : 緬中 ; Wade – Giles : Mien @-@ C[MASK]ung ) . After a long deliberatio[MASK] , the king agreed to submit but wanted the Mongol troops to withdraw . In June 1286 , he sent an embassy led by Shin Ditha Pamauk , [MASK] learned monk , to the emperor 's co[MASK]rt . 
 
 = = = Treaty of Beijing = = = 
 
 In January 1287 , the embassy arrived at B[MASK]ijing , and was received by the Yuan emperor . The Burmese delegat[MASK]on formally acknowledged Mongol suzerainty of their [MASK]ingdom , an[MASK] agreed to pay annual tribute tied to the agricultural output of the country [MASK] ( Indeed , the tribute was n[MASK] longer nominal . ) In exchange , the emperor a[MASK]reed to withdraw his tro[MASK]ps . For the emperor , the B[MASK]rma campaign was the only bright spot ; [MASK]is other Southeast Asian expeditions had [MASK]one badly . He did not want[MASK]to invest more troops pacify the rest [MASK]f the kingdom . He preferred[MASK]a vassal ruler . The Burmese embassy arrived back at Hlegya in May 1287 , and reported the terms to the king . 
 
 = = = Breakdown = = = 
 
 But [MASK]he agree[MASK]ent broke do[MASK]n a month l[MASK]ter . In late June , the defeated king and his small re[MASK]inue left their temporary capital for Pagan . But on 1 July 1287 , the king was c[MASK]ptured en route and assassinated by his second son T[MASK]ihathu , the Viceroy of Prome . Anarchy ensued . Each region in the country which had not[MASK]revolted broke away . No successor to Narathihap[MASK]te , who could honor and enforce the terms of the treaty of Beijing [MASK] emerged . Indeed , a ki[MASK]g would not emerge until May 1289 . 
 
 = = Mongol intervention ( 1287 ) = = 
 
 Given the chaos , the gove[MASK]nor of Yunnan ignored the imperial orders of [MASK]vacuation . The Mongol arm[MASK] commanded by Prince Ye @-@ sin Timour , a grandson of the emp[MASK]ror , marched south toward Pagan . According [MASK]o mainstr[MASK]am traditional ([MASK]British colonial era ) scholarship , the Mongol army ignored the imper[MASK]al orders to evacuate ; fought its way down to Pagan with the loss of 7000 men ; occupied the city ; and sent ou[MASK] detachments to receive homage , one of which reached south of Prome . But not all colonial period scholars agreed with the assessment as none of the contemporary Mongol / Chinese records specifical[MASK]y [MASK]entioned the conquest of Pagan or the temporary completeness of the conquest .[MASK]
 Recent [MASK]esearch shows that the Mongol forces most pr[MASK]bably never reached Pagan . They were held at [MASK]ay by the Burmese defenses led by commanders Athinkhaya , Yazathingyan[MASK]and Thihathu , and probably never got closer [MASK]han 160 km north of Pagan . ( An ins[MASK]ription dated 16 February 1293 by the three brothers claimed[MASK]that they defeated the Mongol army . ) Even if t[MASK]e Mongols did reach Pa[MASK]an , the damage they inflicted was probably minimal . At any rate , the Mongol army suffered heavy casualties , and retreated north to Tagaung . They remained there as the treaty was now void . 
 
 = = Aftermat[MASK] = [MASK] 
 
 The disintegration of the P[MASK]gan Empire was now complete [MASK] But the Mongols refused to fill in the power vacuum they had created . They would send no more expediti[MASK]ns to restor[MASK] [MASK]rder . The emperor apparently had no interest in committing troops that w[MASK]uld be required to pacify the fragmented country . [MASK]ndeed , h[MASK]s r[MASK]al aim all along may h[MASK]ve been "[MASK]to keep the entire region of South[MASK]ast Asia broken and fragmented[MASK]. " It would be another[MASK]two years until one of Narathihapate 's sons , Kyaws[MASK]a , emerged as king of Pagan in May 1289 . But the new " king " controlled just a small area aroun[MASK] the capita[MASK] , and had no real army . The real power in central Burma now reste[MASK] with the three commander brothers . 
 [MASK]he uneasy arrangement would persist until 1297 . The Mongols continued to occupy northern Burma to Tagaung as the province of Zhengmian ( Cheng @-@ Mien ) but ended the [MASK]iction[MASK]l central Burma p[MASK]ovince of Mianzhong on 18 August 1290 . Meanwhile , the power[MASK]struggle in central Burma continued with the three brothers bla[MASK]antly consolidating support . To che[MASK]k their rising pow[MASK]r , Kyawswa submitt[MASK]d to the Mongol[MASK] in January 1297 , and was re[MASK]ognized by[MASK]the Yuan emperor Temür Khan as King of Pagan on 20 March[MASK]1297 . The emperor al[MASK]o [MASK]ave Chinese titles to the brothers as subordinates of Kyawswa . The brother[MASK] resented the new arrangement as it directly reduced their power [MASK] On 17 December 1[MASK]97 , the three brothers overthrew Ky[MASK]wswa , and founded the [MASK]yinsaing Kingd[MASK]m . The dethronement forced the Mongol government to intervene again , leading[MASK]to the second Mongol i[MASK]vasion of Burma ( 1300 – 01 ) . The invasion failed . Two years [MASK]ater , on 4 April 1303 , the Mongols abolished the province of Zhengmian ( Cheng @-@ Mien ) , evacuated Tagaung , and ret[MASK]rned [MASK]o Yunnan [MASK]

 The w[MASK]r was one of several near simul[MASK]aneous wars waged by the Mongol Empire and t[MASK]e Yuan dynasty in the late 13th century .

 The immediate result[MASK]of the war was the collapse of the Pagan Empire . However , the war merely accelerated the collapse but did not cause it .

Had Pagan possessed a str[MASK]nger central government , the coll[MASK]pse could have been temporary , and the country “ could[MASK]have risen again ” . But[MASK]the dynasty could[MASK]not recover , and because the Mongols refused to fill the power vacuum , no viab[MASK]e center emerged in the immediate aftermath . As a result , several minor states fought it out for s[MASK]prema[MASK]y for the bet[MASK]er part of the 14th century . It wa[MASK] only in the[MASK]late 14th century that two relatively strong pow[MASK]rs emerged in the Irrawaddy basin , restoring some semblance of normalcy .

 Perhaps the most enduring legacy of the Mongol invasions was the emergen[MASK]e of[MASK]Tai @-@ Shan states in mainland Southeast Asia[MASK].

By the early 14th century , sever[MASK]l Tai @-@ Shan states had come to dominate a vast [MASK]egion from pr[MASK]sent @-@ day Assam to northern and eastern Myanmar to northern and central Thailand and Laos . Their rise was encouraged by the Mongols , who viewed the states as a use[MASK]u[MASK] buff[MASK]r between Yunnan and [MASK]he rest of Southeast Asia . The Mongols , who were still trying to incorporate Yunnan into the central administrati[MASK]n , were unwilling or unable to make necessary sustained investments to bring the vast regions south of Yunnan into[MASK]the fold .

The main Japanese assault occ[MASK]rred around Lunga ridge south of Henderson Field , man[MASK]ed by troops from several[MASK]U.S. Marine Corps units , [MASK]rimarily troops from the 1st[MASK]Raider an[MASK] 1st Parac[MASK]ute Battali[MASK]ns under U.S. Marine Corps Lieutenant Colonel Merritt A. Edson . Although the Marine defenses were almost overrun , Kawaguchi 's attac[MASK] was ultimately defeated , with heavy losses for the Japanese . 
 Because of the key participa[MASK]ion by Edson 's un[MASK]t in defending the ridge , the ridge was commonly referr[MASK]d to as " E[MASK]son 's " ridge in historical accounts of the battle in Western sources . After Edson 's Ridge , the Japanese continued to send troops to Guadalcanal for further attempts to retake Henderson Field , affecting Japanese offensive operations in other areas of the South Pacific[MASK][MASK]

[MASK]
 On 7 August 1942 , Allied forces ( primarily U.S. ) landed[MASK]on Guadalcanal , Tulagi , and Florida Islands in the Solomon Islands .[MASK]The landings on the islan[MASK]s were meant to deny their [MASK]se by the Japanese as bases for threatening the supply routes[MASK]between the U.S. and [MASK]ustralia . They were also in[MASK]ended to secure the islands as starting points for [MASK] campaign to neutralize the major Japanese[MASK]base at Rabaul and support the Allied New Guinea campaign [MASK] The landings initiated the six @-@ month[MASK]@-@ [MASK]ong Guadalcanal campaign . 
 Taking the Japanese by surprise , by nightfall on 8 August the Allied land[MASK]ng forces had secured Tulagi and nearby small islands , as well as an airfield under construction at Lunga Point ( 9 ° 25 ′ 45 ″ S 160 ° 3 ′ 4 ″ E ) on the[MASK]north shore of the island of Guadalcanal east of the present day capital of Honiara . Vandegrift placed his 11 @,@ 000 troops of the 1st Marine Division on Guadalcanal in a loose perimeter around the Lunga Point area . 
 On 1[MASK] August , the airfield was named Henderson Field after Major Lofton Henderson , a Marine aviat[MASK]r who had been killed at the Battle of Midway . The Allied air[MASK]raft and pilots that subsequently operated out of Henderson Field were called the " Cactus Air [MASK]orce " aft[MASK]r the Allied code name for Guadalcanal . 
 In response to the Allied landi[MASK]gs on Gua[MASK]alcanal , the Japanese Imperial General Headquarters assigned the Imperial Japanese Army 's 17th Army — a corps @-@ s[MASK]zed command based at Rabaul ( 4 ° 11 ′ 56 ″ S 152 ° 9 ′ 57 ″ E ) and under the command of Lieutenant @-@ General Harukichi Hyakutake — with the task of ret[MASK]king Guadalcanal from Allied forces . The 17th Army — heavily involved with the Japanese ca[MASK]paign in N[MASK]w Guinea — had only a few units available to send to the souther[MASK] Solomons area . Of these units , the 35th Infantry Brigade — under Major General Kiyotake Kawaguchi — was at Palau , the 4th ( [MASK]oba ) Infantry Regiment was in the Philippin[MASK]s and the 28th ( Ichiki ) Infantry Regiment — und[MASK]r the command of Colonel Kiyonao Ichiki — was embarked on transport ships near Gua[MASK] . The different units began to move toward Guadalcanal immediately ;[MASK]Ichiki 's regiment —[MASK]the closest — arrived first . The " First Element " of Ichiki [MASK]s unit — consisting of about 917 soldiers — landed from destroyers at Taivu Point ( 9 ° 24 ′ 38 ″ S 160[MASK]° 20 ′ 56 ″ E ) , about[MASK]18 mi ( 29 km ) east of the Lunga perimeter , on August 1[MASK] . 
 Underestimating the strength of Allied forces on Guadalcanal , Ichiki 's First Element conducted a night[MASK]ime frontal assault on Marine positions at Alligator Creek on the [MASK]ast side of the Lunga perimeter in the early morning hours of August 21 . Ichiki 's assault was repulsed with devastating losses for the attackers in what became [MASK]nown as the Battle of the [MASK]enaru : all but 128 of the 9[MASK]7 men of the First Element [MASK] including Ichiki himself ) were killed in [MASK]he battle . The survi[MASK]ors returned to Taivu Point , notified 17th Army headquarters of their defeat in the battle and awaited further reinforcements and orders from Rabaul . 
 By 23 August , Kawaguchi 's unit had reache[MASK] Truk an[MASK] was loaded onto slo[MASK] transport ships for the rest of the trip to Guadalcanal [MASK] Because of the damage caused by Allie[MASK] air attack to a separate troop convoy during the [MASK]attle of the Eastern Solo[MASK]ons , the Japanese decided not to deliver Kawaguchi 's troops to Guadalcanal [MASK]y slow transport ship ; instead , the ships carrying Kawaguchi 's soldiers were sent [MASK][MASK] Rabaul . From there , the Japanese planned to[MASK]deliver Kaw[MASK]guchi 's men to Guadalcanal by destroyers , staging through a Japanese naval base in the Shortland Islands . The Japanese destr[MASK]yers were usually able [MASK]o make the round trip down " The Slot " to Guadalcanal and back in a single night , minimizing their exposure to Allied air attack . However , most of the soldiers ' heavy equipment and supplies , such as heavy artillery , vehicles , and much food and ammunition , could not be taken to Guadalcanal with them . Thes[MASK] high @-@ speed destroyer runs to Guadal[MASK]anal , which occurred throughout t[MASK]e campaign , were later called the " Tokyo Express " by Allied forces and " Rat Transportation " by [MASK]he Japanese . The Japanese controlled the seas around the Solomon Islands during t[MASK]e nighttime and were not challe[MASK]ged by the Allies . [MASK]owever , any J[MASK][MASK]anese ship remaining within t[MASK]e 200 mi [MASK] [MASK]20 km ) range of the aircraft at Henderson Field in daylight was in [MASK]reat danger from air attacks . This " curious tactical situation " held for several months . 
 
 = = = Troop movement = = = 
 
 On 28 August , 600 of Kawaguchi 's troops were loaded on[MASK]o the destroyers Asagiri , Amagiri , Yugiri , and S[MASK][MASK][MASK]akumo , designated Destroyer Division 20 ( DD20 ) . Because of a shortage of fuel , DD20 could not make the entire round trip to Guadalcanal at high s[MASK]eed in one night , but had to start the trip earlier in the day so that they could complete the trip by[MASK]the next morning at a slower speed wh[MASK]ch conserved fuel . At 18 : 05 that day , 11 U.S. dive bombers from VMSB @-@ 232 un[MASK]er the command of Lt. Col. Richard Mangru[MASK] , flew from Hende[MASK]son Field and located and attacked DD20 about 70 mi ( 110 km [MASK] no[MASK]th of Guadalcanal , sinking Asagiri and heavily damaging Y[MASK]giri and Shirak[MASK]mo . Amagiri took Shirakumo in tow and the three destroyers returned to the Shortlands without completin[MASK] the[MASK]r miss[MASK]on . The attack on DD20 killed 62 of Kawaguchi 's soldiers and 94 crew members . 
 Subs[MASK]quen[MASK] " Express " [MASK]uns were more successful [MASK] Between 29 August and 4 Septembe[MASK] , var[MASK]ous Japanese light cruisers , destroyers , and patrol boats were able to land almost 5 @,@ 000 t[MASK]oops at Taivu Point , including all of the 35th Infantry Brigade , one [MASK]attalion of the Aoba Regim[MASK]nt , and the rest of Ichiki 's regiment . General Kawaguchi , who landed at Tai[MASK]u Point on the 31 August Express run , was placed in command of all the Japanese troops on Guadalcanal . On the nig[MASK][MASK] of 4 / 5 September [MASK] as three of the Express destr[MASK]yer[MASK] — Yūdachi , Hatsu[MASK]uki , and Murakumo — prepared to shell Henderson Field[MASK]after landing their troops ,[MASK]they detected and sank two U.S. sh[MASK]ps in the vicinity , the small , old destroyer transports ( called " APDs [MASK] by the[MASK]U.S. Marines ) USS Litt[MASK]e and Gregory that were use[MASK] to shuttle Allied troops arou[MASK]d the Guadalcanal / Tulagi area . [MASK] In spite of the successes of the destroyer runs , Kawaguchi insisted that as many soldiers of his brigade as possible be delivered to Guadalcanal by slow barges . Therefore , a convoy carrying 1 @,@ 100 of Kawaguchi 's troops and heavy equipment in[MASK]61 barges , ma[MASK]nly from the 2nd Battalion , 124th Infantry Regiment under the command of Colonel Akinosuka Oka , departed the northern coast[MASK]of Santa Isabel Island on 2 September . On 4 – 5 September[MASK], [MASK]ircraft from Henderson Field attac[MASK]ed the barge convoy , killing about 90 of the soldiers in the barges and destroying much of the unit 's heavy equipment . Most[MASK]of the remaining 1 @,@ [MASK]00 [MASK]roops were able to land nea[MASK] Kamimbo ( 9 ° 15 ′ 32 ″[MASK]S 159 ° 40 ′ 18 ″ E ) , west of the Lunga perimeter over the next few days . By 7 September , Kawaguchi had 5 @,@[MASK]200 troops at Taivu Point and 1 @,@ 000 west of the Lunga perimeter . Kawaguchi was confident enough that he could defeat the[MASK]Allied forces[MASK]facing him that[MASK]he declined an offer from the 17th Army for delivery [MASK]f one more infantry battalion to augmen[MASK] his forces . Kawaguchi b[MASK]lieved that there were only about 2 @,@ 000 U.S. Marines on Guadalcanal . 
 During this time , Vandegrift [MASK]ontinued to direct efforts to strengthen and [MASK]mprove the defenses of the Lunga perimeter . Between 21 August and 3 September , he relocated three Marine ba[MASK]talions — includ[MASK]ng the 1st Raider Battalion , under U.S. Lieutenant Colonel Merritt A. Edson ( Edson 's Raiders ) , and th[MASK] 1st Parachute Battalion — from Tulagi and Gavu[MASK]u to Guadalcanal . These units added a[MASK][MASK]ut 1 @,@ 500 troops to Vandegrift 's original 11 @,@ 000 men defending Henderson Field[MASK]. The[MASK]1st Parachute battalion , which had suffered h[MASK]avy casualties in the Battle of Tulagi and Gavutu @-@ Tanambogo in August , was placed under [MASK]dson 's command .

 Kawaguchi set the date for his attack on the Lunga perimete[MASK] for 12 September and began mar[MASK]hing his forces west from Taivu towards Lunga Point on 5 September . He radioed 17th Army and requested that it carry out air strikes on Henderson [MASK]ield beginning on 9 September , and that naval warships be stationed off Lun[MASK]a Point on September 12 to " destroy any Americans[MASK]who attempted to flee from the island[MASK]. " On 7 September , Kawaguchi issued his attack plan to " rout and annihilate th[MASK] enemy in the vicinity of the Guadalcanal Island airfield . " Kawaguchi 's plan called for his forces to split into three , approach the Lunga perimeter inland , and launch a surprise night attack . Oka 's force would attack the perimeter from the west while Ichiki 's Seco[MASK]d Echelon — renamed the Kuma Battalion — would[MASK]attack from the east . The mai[MASK] attack would be by Kawaguchi 's " Ce[MASK]ter Body " , numb[MASK]ring 3 @,@ 000 men in three battalions , from the south of the Lunga perimeter . By 7 September , most of Kawaguch[MASK] 's tro[MASK]ps had started marching from Ta[MASK]vu towards Lunga Point along the coastline . A[MASK]out 250 Japanese troops remained behind to guard the brigade 's supply base at Taivu . 
 Meanwhile , [MASK]ative island scouts — directed by British government official and officer in the British Solomon Islands Prote[MASK]torate Defence Force , Martin Clemens — told the Marines of Japanese troops at [MASK]aivu , [MASK]ear the village of Tasimboko [MASK] about 17 mi ( 27 km ) east of Lunga . Edson launched a raid against the[MASK]Japanese troops at Taivu . Destroyer transports USS McKean and Manley and [MASK]wo patrol boats took 813 of Edson 's men to Taivu in two trips . Edson and his first wave of 501 troops landed at T[MASK]ivu at[MASK]05 : 20 ( local time ) on 8 September . Supported by aircraft from[MASK]Henderson Field and gunfire from the destroyer transports , Edson '[MASK] men a[MASK]vanced towards Tasimboko village but were slowed by Japanese resistance . At 11 : 00 , the r[MASK]st of Edson 's men landed . W[MASK]th this reinforcement and more support from the Henderson Field aircraft , Edson 's force pushed into the village . The Japanese defenders , believing a major landing was underway [MASK]ft[MASK]r[MASK]observing the concurrent approach of an Allied supply ship convoy heading towards Lunga Point , retreated into the jungle , leaving behind 27 dead . Two Marine[MASK] were kil[MASK]ed . 
 In Tasimboko , Edson 's troops discovered the supply base for Kawaguchi 's forces ,[MASK]including large stockpiles of food , ammunition and medical supplies , and a shortwave ra[MASK]io . The Marines seized documents , equipment and food supplies , destroyed the rest , and returned to the Lunga perimeter at 17 : 30 . The quantities of supplies an[MASK] [MASK]ntelligence from the captured document[MASK] revealed that at least 3 @,@ 000 J[MASK]panese troops were on the island and apparently pl[MASK]nning an attack . 
 Edson and Colonel Geral[MASK] Thomas , Vandegrift 's operati[MASK]ns officer ,[MASK]bel[MASK]eved that t[MASK]e J[MASK]panese attack would come at the Lu[MASK]ga Ri[MASK]ge , a narrow , gra[MASK]sy , 1 @,@ 000 [MASK] ( 1 @,@ 100 yd ) long , coral ridge ( 9 ° 26 ′ 39 ″ S 160 ° 2 ′ 50 ″ E ) parallel to the Lunga River just south of Henderson Field . The ridge offered a natural avenue of approach to the airfield , commanded the surrounding area and was almost undefended . Edson and [MASK]hom[MASK]s tried to persuade Vandegrift to move f[MASK]rces to defend the ridge , but Vandegrift refused , believing tha[MASK] the Japanese were more likely[MASK]to attack alon[MASK] the coast . Finally , Thomas convinced Vandegrift that the ridge was a good location for Edson 's Raiders to " rest " from their actions of the [MASK]receding month . On [MASK]1 September , the 840 men of Edson 's unit — including the 1st Raiders and the Paramarines — deployed onto [MASK]nd arou[MASK]d the ridge and prepared to defend it . 
 Kawaguchi 's Center Body of troops was planning to attack the[MASK]Lunga perimeter at the ridge , which they called " the cent[MASK]pede " ( mukade gata ) because of i[MASK]s shape . On 9 September , Kawagu[MASK]h[MASK] 's troops left the coast at Koli Point . Split into four columns , they marched into the jungle towards their predesignated a[MASK]tack points[MASK]south and southeast of the airfield . Lack of good maps , at le[MASK]st one faulty compass , and thick , almost impenetrable jungle caused the Japanes[MASK] columns to proceed slowly and zigzag , costing a lot of time . A[MASK] the same time , [MASK]ka 's troops [MASK]pproach[MASK]d the Lunga perimeter from the west . Oka had some intelligence[MASK]on the Marine defenses , extrac[MASK]ed from a U.S. Army pilot captured on 30 August . 
 During the day of 12 September , Kawaguchi 's troops strugg[MASK]ed through th[MASK] [MASK]ungle toward th[MASK]ir assembly points for [MASK]h[MASK]t night 's attacks . Kawaguchi wanted his three Center Body bat[MASK]alions in plac[MASK] by 14 : 00 , but they did not reach t[MASK]eir assembly areas until after 22 : 00 . Oka was also delay[MASK]d in his advance[MASK]towards t[MASK]e Marine lines in the west . Only the Kuma battalion reported that t[MASK]ey were in place on time . Desp[MASK]te the problems in[MASK]reaching the planned attack po[MASK]itions , Kawaguchi was still confident in his a[MASK]tack [MASK]lan because a[MASK]captured U.S. p[MASK]lot disclosed that th[MASK] ridge was the weakest part of the Marine defenses . Japanese bombers attacked the ridge during daytime on 11 – 12 September , causing a few casualties , in[MASK]luding two killed . 
 
 = = = First night 's action = = = 
 
 The American[MASK] knew of the approach of the J[MASK]panese forces from reports from native scouts and their own patrols , but did not know exactly where or when they would attack . The ridge around which Edson deployed his[MASK]men consisted of three dis[MASK]inct hillocks . At the southern tip and surrounded on three sides by thick jungle was Hill 80 ( so named because it rose 80 ft ( 24 m ) above sea level ) . Six hundr[MASK]d yards north was Hill 123 ( 123 ft ( 37 m ) high ) , the dominant feature o[MASK] the ridge . The northernmost hillock was unnamed and about 60 ft ( 18 m ) high . Edson placed the five companies from the Raider battalion on the west side of the ridge and the three Parachute battalion compan[MASK]es on the east side , holding positions in depth from Hill 80 back to Hil[MASK] 1[MASK]3 . Two of the five Raider companies , " B " and " C " , held a line between the ridge , a small , swampy lago[MASK]n , and the Lunga [MASK]iver . Machine @-@ gun teams from " E " Company , the heavy weapons[MASK]company , were sca[MASK]tered throughout the defenses . Edson placed his command post on Hill 123 . 
 At 21 : 30 on 12 September , the Japanese cruiser Send[MASK]i and three destroyers shelled[MASK]the Lunga perimeter for 20 minutes and illuminated the ridge with a searchlight . Japanese artillery began shelling the Marine lines , but did little damage . At the same time , scattered groups of Kawaguchi 's troops began skirmishing with Marines around the ridge . Kawaguchi 's 1st B[MASK]ttalion — led [MASK]y Major Yukichi Kokusho — attacked the Raider 's " C " company between the lagoon and the Lunga River , overrunnin[MASK] at least one platoon and forcing the Marine company to fall back to the ridge . Kokusho 's unit b[MASK]c[MASK]me entangled with troops from Kawaguchi 's 3rd Battalion under Lieutenant Colonel Kusukichi Watanabe , who[MASK]w[MASK]re still struggling to reach their attack positions , and the resulting [MASK]onfusion effectively stopped the Japanese attack on the ridge that night . Kawaguchi , who was having trouble locating where [MASK]e was in relation to the U.S. Marine lines as well as coordinating his troops '[MASK]att[MASK]cks , lat[MASK]r complained , " Due t[MASK] the devilish jungle , the brigade was scattered all over and was completely beyond my con[MASK]rol . In my whole life I have never f[MASK]lt s[MASK] disappointed and helpless . " Twelve U.S. Marines were killed ; Japanese casualties are unknown but perhaps somewhat [MASK]r[MASK]ater . Although both [MASK]ka in th[MASK] west and the Kuma unit in the eas[MASK] t[MASK]ied to attack the Marine lines that night , they failed to make contact and halted ne[MASK]r the Marine lines at dawn . 
 At fir[MASK]t light on 13 September , Cactus Air Force airc[MASK]aft and Marine ar[MASK]illery fired into the area just[MASK]south of the ridge , forcing any Japanese out in the open to s[MASK]ek cover in the nearby jungle . The Japanese[MASK]suffered several casualties , including two officers from Watanabe 's battalion . At 05 : 50 , Kawaguchi decided to regroup his forces for another attack that n[MASK]ght . 
 
 = = = Second night 's action on the ridge = = = 
 
 Expecting the Japanese to attack again that n[MASK]ght , [MASK]dson directed his troops to improve their defenses on an[MASK] around the ridge . After a failed attempt by two companies [MASK]o retake the ground on the Marine right [MASK]lank lost to Kokusho the night before , Edson repositioned his forces . He pulled his front back ab[MASK]ut 400 yd ( 370 m ) to a line that stretched 1 @,@ 800 yd ( 1 @,@ 600 m ) , star[MASK]ing at the Lunga River and crossing the ridge a[MASK]out 150 yd ( 140 m ) south of Hill 123 . Around and behind Hill 123[MASK]he placed[MASK]five companies . Any Ja[MASK]anese attackers surmounting Hi[MASK]l 80 [MASK]ould have to advan[MASK]e over 400 yd ( 37[MASK] m ) of open terrain to close with the Marine positions at Hill [MASK]23 . With only a few hours to prepare , the Marines were only able to c[MASK]nstruct rudimentary and shallow fortifications . They were low on ammunition , with one or two grenades for each Marine . Vandegrift ordered a reserve force consisting of the 2nd Battalion , 5th Marine Regiment ( 2 /[MASK]5 ) to move into a position just [MASK]o the rear of Edson 's troops . In addition , a battery of four 105mm howitzers from the 1[MASK]th Marine Regimen[MASK] moved to a location from where it could provide direct fire onto[MASK]the ridge , and a forward artillery observer was placed w[MASK]th Edson 's front line units . 
 Late in[MASK]the afternoon , Edson stepped onto a gr[MASK]nade box and addressed his exhauste[MASK] troops , saying , 
 You men have done a great[MASK]job , and I have just one more thing to ask of yo[MASK][MASK]. Hold out just one more night . I know we 've been w[MASK]thout sleep a long time . But we expect another attack from them tonight and they may come through here . I have every reason t[MASK] believe that we will have reliefs here for all of us in the morning . 
 Edson 's speech " raised the spirits " of [MASK]h[MASK] Raiders and helped them prepare mentally for the night ahead . 
 As the sun[MASK]set on 13 September , Kawaguchi faced Edson 's 830 Marines with 3 @,@ 000 troops of his brigade [MASK] plus an[MASK]assortment of light artillery . The night [MASK]as pitch black , with[MASK]no moon . At 21 : 00 , seven[MASK]Japanese destroyers briefly bombarded the ridge . Kawaguchi 's attack began just after nightfall , with K[MASK]kusho '[MASK] battalion assaulting Raider Comp[MASK]ny B on the Marine right flank , just to the west of the ridge . The force of the assault caused Company B to fall back to Hill 123 . Under Marine a[MASK]tillery fire , Kokusho reassembled his men and continued his a[MASK]tack . Without pausing to try to " roll @-@ up " the other nearby Mari[MASK]e units , whose flanks were now unprotected ,[MASK]Kokusho 's unit surged forward thro[MASK]gh the swampy lowlands bet[MASK]een the ridge and the Lunga River , heading for the airfie[MASK]d . Kokusho 's men came u[MASK][MASK]n a pile of Marine supplies an[MASK] rations . Not having eaten adequately for a couple of days , they paused to " gorge themselves " on the " C " and " K " rations . Kokusho ordered his[MASK]men to continue the attack . At about 03 : 00 , he led them against the M[MASK]rine units around the[MASK]northern portion of the ridge , just short of the air[MASK]ield , as well as Hill 123 . In the heavy fighting [MASK]hat followed , Kokusho and around 100 of his men were kill[MASK]d , ending that attack . 
 [MASK]eanwhile , Kawaguchi 's 2nd Battalion , under Major Masao Tamur[MASK] , assembled for their planned assault against Hill 80 from the jungle south of the ridge . Mari[MASK]e observers spotted T[MASK]mura 's preparations and called in artillery fire . At about 22 : 00 , a ba[MASK]rage from twelve 105 mm ( 4 @.@ 1 in ) guns hit[MASK]Tamura 's position . In response , two companies of Tamura 's tr[MASK]ops — numbering about [MASK]20 men — charge[MASK] up Hill 80 with fixed bayonets behind their own barrage of mortar fire and grenade[MASK] . Tamura 's attack hit [MASK]omp[MASK]ny B of the Marine Parachute battalion and also Raider Company B , pushing the Parachutis[MASK]s off the east side of the ridge into a draw below th[MASK] ridgeline . To protect the exposed Raide[MASK] Company B , Edson immediately ordered them to pull back onto Hill 123 . [MASK] At the same time , a Japane[MASK]e company from Watanabe 's battalion infiltr[MASK]ted through a gap between the east side of the ridge and Parachute Company C. Deciding that their positions were now untenable , Parach[MASK]te Companies B and C climbed onto the ridge and retreated to a position behind Hill 123 . In the dar[MASK]ness and confusion of the battle ,[MASK]the retreat q[MASK]ickly became confused and dis[MASK]rganized . A few Marines began yelling that the Japanese were attacking with poison gas , scaring other Mari[MASK]es [MASK]ho no longer possessed their gas masks . After arriving behind Hill 123 , some of the Marines continued on towards the airfield , repeating the word " withdraw " to anyone within earshot . Other Marines began to[MASK]follow them . Just at the moment that[MASK]it appeared that the Marines on the hil[MASK] were about to break and head for the rear in a rout , Edson ,[MASK]Major Kenneth D. Bailey from Edson 's staff , and other Marin[MASK] officers appeared and , with " v[MASK]vid[MASK]" languag[MASK] , herded the Mar[MASK]nes back into defensive [MASK]ositions around Hill 123 . 
 As the Marines formed into a horseshoe @-@ sh[MASK]ped [MASK]ine [MASK]round Hill 123 , Tamura 's battalion began a ser[MASK]es of frontal assaults [MASK]n the hill , charging up the saddle from Hill 80 and up from below the east side of the ridge . Under the light of parachute flares dro[MASK]ped by at least one Japanese flo[MASK]tplane , the Marines repulsed the first two attacks by Tamura 's men . Tamura 's troops hoisted a 75 mm ( 2 @.@ 95 in ) " regimental " gun to the top of Hill 80 in an effort to fire it directly at the Marines . Thi[MASK] gun , which "[MASK]could have turned [MASK]he tide in favor of the Japanese , " however , was di[MASK]abled by a faulty firi[MASK]g pin[MASK]. At midnight , during a short lull in the fighting , Edson ordered Parachute Companies B and C to advance from behind Hill 123 to strengthen his left flank . With fixed bayonets , t[MASK]e Para[MASK]arines swept forward , killi[MASK]g Japanese soldiers who had overrun the Marine lines and were [MASK]pparently preparing to roll up the Marine lines from the flank , and took position o[MASK] the east side o[MASK] th[MASK] hill . Marines from other units , as well [MASK]s members of Edson[MASK][MASK]s command staff , including Major Bailey , took ammunition and gr[MASK]nades under fire to the Marines around Hill 123 , who were running criti[MASK]ally low . Said Marine participant Captain William J. McKennan , " The Japane[MASK][MASK] attack was almost cons[MASK]ant , like a rain that subsi[MASK]es for a moment and then pours the harder ... When one wave was mowed down - and I mean mowed down - another followed it into death . " 
 The [MASK]apa[MASK]ese hit Edson 's left flank just after the Parachutists took position but were again stopped by Marine rifle , machine @-@ gun , mortar , and grenade fire . Marine 105 mm and 75 mm artillery was also taking a heavy toll on the attacking Japanese . A captured Japanese soldier[MASK]later [MASK]aid that his unit was " annih[MASK]lated " by the Marine artillery fire , [MASK]hich only 10[MASK]% of his company survived . 
 By 04 : 00[MASK], after withstanding several more[MASK]assaults , some of which resulted in hand @-@ to @-@ hand fighting , and severe sniper fire from all sides , Edson 's men were joined by troops from the 2nd Battalion , 5th Marine Regiment , [MASK]ho helped repulse two more Japanese attacks before dawn . Throug[MASK]out the night , as Kawaguchi 's men came close to overrunning the Marine defenses , Edson remained standing about 20 yd ( 18 m ) behind the Marine firing line on Hill 123 , exhorting his troops and d[MASK]recting their defensive efforts . Said Marine Captain Tex Smith , who was in position to observe Edson for most of the night , " I can say that if there is such a thing a[MASK] one man holding a battalion together , Edson did it that night . He stood just behind the front lines – stood , when most of us hugged the ground . " 
 During the hea[MASK]y fighting , portions of three Japanese companies , inclu[MASK]ing two from Tamura 's [MASK]nd one from Watanabe 's bat[MASK]alions , skirted the Marine defenses on the ridge , w[MASK]ile suffering heavy [MASK]osses from Marine gunfire , and reached the edge of [MASK] Fighter One " , a secondary runway of[MASK]Henderso[MASK] Field . A counterattack by th[MASK] Marine engineers stopped one Japanese company 's advances and forced it to retreat . Th[MASK] other tw[MASK] companies waited at the edge of the jungle for reinfor[MASK]emen[MASK]s to arrive befo[MASK]e attacking into the open area around the airfield . When no reinforcements joined them , both companies went back to their o[MASK]iginal positions s[MASK]uth of t[MASK]e ridge after daybreak . Most of the rest of Watanabe 's bat[MASK]alion did not participate in t[MASK]e battle because they lost contact with their commander durin[MASK] the night . 
 As the sun rose on 14 September , pockets o[MASK] Japanese soldiers remained scattered along both sides of the ridge . But[MASK]with Tamura 's battalion shattered after losing ¾ o[MASK][MASK]its officers and men , and with heavy casualties to his other attacking units as well [MASK] Kawaguch[MASK] 's assault on the ridge had effectively ended . A[MASK]out 100 Japane[MASK]e soldiers still remained in the open on[MASK]the south[MASK]slope of [MASK]ill 80 , perhaps preparing [MASK]or one [MASK]ore charge on Hill 123 . [MASK]t first light , three U.S. Army aircraft from the 67th Fighter Squadron at Henderson Field , acting on a request personally delivered by Bailey , strafed the Japanese near Hill[MASK]80 and killed most of them , with the few survivors retreating back int[MASK] the jungle .

 As the battle on the ri[MASK]ge took place , Kawaguchi 's Kuma and Oka units also a[MASK]tacked the Marine defenses on the east and west s[MASK]des of the Lunga perimeter . The Kuma battalion — [MASK]e[MASK] by Major Takeshi Mizuno — attacked the southeastern sector of the Lunga perimeter , defended by Marin[MASK]s of the 3rd Battalion , 1[MASK]t Mari[MASK]e Regiment ( 3 / 1 ) . Mizuno 's attack started around midnight , with one company attacking through Marine artillery fire and engaging in h[MASK]n[MASK] [MASK]-@ to @-@ hand combat with the Marine defenders before being thrown back . Mizuno was killed in the attack . After daybreak , t[MASK]e Marines , believing that the rest of Mizuno 's battalion was still in the area [MASK] sent forward six light tanks without infantry support to sweep the [MASK]rea [MASK]n front of the Marine lines ; four Ja[MASK]anese 37 mm ( 1 @.@ 46 in[MASK]) anti @-@ tank guns destroyed or disable[MASK] three of them . After abandoning their burning tanks , several of the[MASK]disabled tanks ' crewmembers were bayoneted and killed by the Japanese . One tank tumbled down an embankment into t[MASK]e Tenaru River , drow[MASK]in[MASK] [MASK]ts crew . 
 At 23 : 00 on 14 September , the remnants of the Kuma battalion conducted another attack on the same portion of the Marine lines , but were repulsed . A final " weak " attack by [MASK]he Kuma unit on the evening of 15 September was also defeated . 
 Oka 's un[MASK]t of about 650 men atta[MASK]ked the Marines at several[MASK]locations on [MASK]he west side of the Lunga perimeter . At about 04 : 00 on 14 September , [MASK]wo Japanese companies attacked posit[MASK]ons held by the 3rd Battalion[MASK], 5th Marine Regiment ( 3 / 5 ) near the coast and were thrown back with heavy losses . Another Japanese company captured a small ridge s[MASK]m[MASK]what inland but was then p[MASK]nned down by Marine artillery fire throughout the day and took heavy losses before w[MASK]thd[MASK]awing on the evening of 14 September . T[MASK]e rest of Oka 's unit failed t[MASK] fin[MASK] the Mari[MASK]e lines and did not participate in the attack .

 At 13 : 05 on 14 September , Kawaguchi led the survivors of his shattered brigade away from the ridge and deeper into the jungle , where they rest[MASK]d and tended to their wounded[MASK]all the next day . Kawagu[MASK]hi 's units we[MASK]e then ordered to withdraw west to the Matanikau [MASK]iver valley to join with Oka 's unit , a 6 mi ( 9 @.@ 7 km ) marc[MASK] over difficult terrain . Kawaguchi 's troops began the march on the morning of 1[MASK] September . Almost every soldier able to walk had to help carry the wounde[MASK] . As the march progressed , the [MASK]xhausted and hungry soldiers [MASK] who had eaten their last rations on the morning before [MASK][MASK]eir withdrawal , began to discar[MASK] their heavy equipment an[MASK] then their rifles . By the time mos[MASK] of them reached Oka 's positions at Kokumbona five days later , only half still carried their weapons . The Kuma battalion 's survivors ,[MASK]attempt[MASK]ng to follow Kawaguc[MASK]i 's Center Body forces , became lost , wandered for three weeks in the jungle , and[MASK]almost sta[MASK]ved to death before finally reaching [MASK]awaguchi '[MASK] camp . 
 [MASK]n total , Kawaguchi 's forces lost about 830 killed in the attack , including 350 in Tamura 's battalion , 200 in Kokusho 's battalion , 120 in Oka 's fo[MASK]ce , 100 in the Kuma battalion , and 60 in Watanabe 's battalion[MASK]. An unknown number of wounded also died during the withdrawal march to the Matanika[MASK] . O[MASK] and around the ri[MASK]ge , th[MASK] Marines[MASK]counted 500 Japanese dead , includ[MASK]ng 200 on the slopes of Hill 123 . The Marines suffe[MASK]ed 80 [MASK]illed between 12 and 14 S[MASK]ptember . 
 On 17 September[MASK], Vandegrift sent two companies from the 1st Battalion , 1st Marine Regiment ( 1 / 1 ) to pursue the retreating Japanese . The Marines were ambushed by two Japanese companies acting as rear @-@ gu[MASK]rds for the withdrawal[MASK], and one Marine platoon was pinned dow[MASK] as the rest of the Marines retreated . The Marine company commander requested permission to attempt to rescu[MASK] his platoon but was denied by Vandegrift .[MASK]By nightfall , the Japanese overran and nearly an[MASK]ihilated the platoon , killing 24 Marines with only a few wounded members of the platoon surviving [MASK] On 20 September , a patrol f[MASK]om Edson 's Raiders enc[MASK]untered stragglers fro[MASK] Kawaguchi 's retreating colum[MASK] and called in artillery fire that killed 19 of them . 
[MASK]As t[MASK]e Japanese regrouped west of the Matanikau , th[MASK] U.S. forces concentrated on shoring up and strengthening their Lunga de[MASK]enses . On 14 September , Vandegrift moved an[MASK]ther battalion , the 3rd Battalion , 2nd Marine Regiment ( 3 /[MASK]2 ) , fr[MASK]m Tulagi to Guadalcanal . On 18 September , an Allied naval convoy delivered 4 @,@ 1[MASK]7 men from the 3rd Provisional Marine Brigade ( the U.S. 7th Marine Regiment augmented by addit[MASK]onal support units ) to Guadalcanal . These reinforcements all[MASK]wed Vandegrift — beginning on 19 Septemb[MASK]r — to establish an unbroken lin[MASK] of de[MASK]en[MASK]e around the Lunga perimeter . Vandegrift 's forces ' next significant clash[MASK]s with the J[MASK]panese occurred along the Matanikau Riv[MASK]r from 23 – 27 September and 6 – 9 October .

 On 15 Se[MASK]tember , General Hyak[MASK]take at Rabaul learned of Kawaguchi 's d[MASK]feat , th[MASK] Imperial Japanese Army 's first defeat in[MASK]olving a unit of this size in the war . The general forwarded the news to th[MASK] Imperial General Headqu[MASK]rters in Japan . In an emergency session , the [MASK]op Japanese army and navy command staffs concluded that , " Guadalcanal might develop into the decisive battle of the war . " The results of the[MASK]battle beg[MASK]n to[MASK]have a telling strat[MASK]gic [MASK]mpact on Japanese operations in other areas of[MASK]the Pacific . Hy[MASK]kutake realized that , i[MASK] [MASK]rder to send suffi[MASK]ient troop[MASK] and materiel to defeat the Allied forces [MASK][MASK] Guadalcan[MASK]l , he could no longer support the major Japanese offensive [MASK]n the Kokoda Track in New Guinea . Hyakutake — with the concurrence of the General[MASK]Headquarter[MASK] — ordered his troops on New Guinea , who were within 30 mi ( 48 km ) of their objective of Port Moresby — to withdraw until the Guadalcanal matter[MASK]was resolve[MASK] . The Japane[MASK]e were never able to restart their dri[MASK]e towards Port Moresby ; the defeat at Edson 's Ridge contributed not only to Japan 's defeat in the Guadalcanal campaign , but also to Japan 's ultimate d[MASK]feat throu[MASK]hout the South Pacific . 
 After delivering more forces during the next month the Japanese mounted a maj[MASK]r ground offensive on Guadalcanal , led by Hyakutake[MASK], i[MASK] late Octobe[MASK] 1942 at the Battle fo[MASK] Henderson [MASK]ie[MASK]d , but it resulted in an even more decisive defeat fo[MASK] the Japanese . Vandegrift later stated th[MASK]t Kawaguchi 's assa[MASK]lt on the ridge in September was the only time during the entire campaign he had doubts[MASK]about the outcome and that[MASK]had it succeeded , " we would have been in a pretty ba[MASK] co[MASK]dition . " H[MASK]storian Richard B. Fra[MASK]k adds , " The Japanese never came closer to victory on the island itself than in September 1942 , on a ridg[MASK] thrusting up from[MASK]the jungle just south of the critical airfield , best [MASK]nown ever after as Bloody Ridge .

 = New Jersey Route 50 = 
 
 Route 50 is a state highway in the southern part of the U.S. [MASK]tate of New Jersey . It runs 26 @.@ 02 mi ( 41 @.@ 88 km ) from an intersection with U.S. Rou[MASK]e 9 ( US [MASK] ) and the Garden State Parkwa[MASK] in Upper Township , Cape [MASK]ay County to an intersection with US 30 and County Route 563 ( CR 563 ) in [MASK]gg Harbor City , Atlantic County . The route , which is mostly a two @-@ lane undivided ro[MASK]d , passes through mostly rural areas of Atlantic and Cape May counties as well as the communities of Tuckahoe , Corbin City , Estell Manor , and Mays Landing . NJ 50 intersects several roads , includ[MASK]ng Route 49 in Tu[MASK]kahoe , US 40 in Mays Landing , and [MASK]S 322 and the Atlantic City Expressway in [MASK]amilton Township[MASK]. 
 The port[MASK]on of c[MASK]rrent Route 50 between Seaville and Petersburg received[MASK]funding in 1910[MASK]to become a spur of the Ocean Hi[MASK]hway . In 1917 , what is now Route 50 was [MASK]esignated a part of pre @-@ 1927 Route 14 , a route that was to run from Cape May to[MASK]Egg Harbor City . Route 50 was designated onto its current alignment in 1927 , replacing t[MASK]is portion [MASK]f pre @-@ 1927 Route[MASK]1[MASK] . In 1960 , a freeway was proposed for Route 50 , running from the Garden State Parkway in Dennis Town[MASK]hip to US 30 in Mullica To[MASK]nship . This proposal was canceled by the mid @-@ 1970s due to financial and environmental concerns as well as lack of traffic . The intercha[MASK]ge between Route 50 and the Atlantic City [MASK]xpressway was reconstructed into a full i[MASK]terch[MASK]nge , with completion in June 2010 . 
 
 = = Route description = = 
 
 Route 50 begins at an i[MASK]tersection with US 9 in[MASK]th[MASK] Seaville section of Upper Township , Cape Ma[MASK] County , heading to the north on a two @-@ lane undivided road . From [MASK]he southern terminus , a ramp provides access to and from the southbound Garden S[MASK]ate Parkway . The road heads north through mostly rural wooded areas with some buildings . It intersects CR 671 in Greenf[MASK]eld before coming to a j[MASK]nc[MASK]ion with [MASK]R 616 . Later , Route 50 Cedar [MASK]wamp Creek in an area of marshland . At this crossing , the road runs closely parallel to a Conrail Shared Assets Operations railroad line before entering P[MASK]tersburg , where it splits from th[MASK] railroad tracks and comes to a crossroad with CR 610 . Upon leaving Peters[MASK]urg , Route 50 turns to the[MASK]north again and crosses over the Conrail Shared Assets Opera[MASK]ions railroad line , intersecting CR 631 . It co[MASK]tinues to Tuckaho[MASK] and comes to CR 669 . Past this intersection , the route[MASK]meets CR 557 and CR 664 . Route 50 forms a concurrency with CR 557[MASK]and the two routes head north and encounter the eastern terminus of[MASK]Route 49 before leaving Tuckahoe . 
 Not far after Route 49 ,[MASK]the road crosses the Tuckahoe River int[MASK] [MASK]orbin City , Atlantic County . In Corbin City [MASK] it [MASK]eads into residential areas , with CR 611 looping to the west of the route . Route 50 and C[MASK] 5[MASK]7 continue northwes[MASK] and intersect CR 648 , where the road turns north into more forested areas . At the junction with CR 645 [MASK] [MASK]he route turn[MASK] to the nort[MASK]east and enters Estell M[MASK]nor , becoming Broad Street . CR 557 splits from Route 5[MASK] by heading northwest on [MASK]uena Tuckahoe Road and Route 50 heads through some a[MASK]ricultural clearings concurrent with CR 557 Truck , pass[MASK]ng to the west of the MacNamara Wildl[MASK]fe Area , which is known as a breeding ground for several species of birds . The route intersects CR 637 , turning to the nort[MASK]east . 
 After passing some homes and Stephen Lake , the road turns to the north and passes to the west of Est[MASK][MASK]l Manor County Park . The route crosses the South River into Weymouth Township , passing the residential [MASK]ommunity of Belc[MASK]ville to the east and meeting CR 669 . It soon enters Hamilton To[MASK]nship , where the name of the road becomes Mill [MASK]treet and it comes to a junction with US 40 ( Hard[MASK]ng Highway ) . CR 557 Truck heads to the west on US 40 at this point while Rout[MASK] 50 heads east on US 40 , and CR 616 continues north . 
 US 40 and NJ 50 follow the Harding Highway , a two @-@ lane undivided r[MASK]ad , t[MASK]rning to the northeast and crossing the Great Egg Harbor River . Upon passing over t[MASK]e river , enters Mays Landing and turns north , encountering CR 617 before passing over an aband[MASK]ned railroad line and heading into the downtown a[MASK]ea of Mays [MASK]anding . He[MASK]e , the road crosses CR 559 , and US 40 splits fro[MASK] NJ 50 by[MASK]turning east along that road . Meanwhile , [MASK]oute 50 continues north on Cape May Avenue , passing through [MASK]eveloped[MASK]areas . It leaves May[MASK] Landing and heads into back into f[MASK]rests . The route turns to the northeast , [MASK]assing near the Clover Le[MASK]f Lakes residenti[MASK]l development , before coming to an interchange with US 322 ( Black Horse Pike ) . 
 Past this inte[MASK]change , Route 50 wid[MASK]ns to a four @-@ lane divided highway and reache[MASK] a full[MASK]interchange with the Atlantic City Expressway . The route becomes a two @-@ lane undivided road again and continues[MASK]through inhabi[MASK]ed areas , crossin[MASK] into Galloway Township , wh[MASK]re there is an intersection with CR 686 . A short distance later , the road [MASK]rosses New Jersey Transit ’ s Atlantic City Line near the Egg Harbor Cit[MASK] Station and ent[MASK]rs Egg Harbor City , turn[MASK]ng[MASK]into Philadelphia Aven[MASK]e . A block after the railroad crossing , Route 50 end[MASK] at an inters[MASK]ction with US 30 and CR 563 ( White Horse Pike ) , with CR 563 conti[MASK]uing north on [MASK]hiladelphia Avenue at this point . 
 Route[MASK]50 is an important route linking t[MASK]e Atl[MASK]ntic City [MASK]xpressway with the Jers[MASK]y Shore resorts in Cape M[MASK]y County , serving as an alternate to more congested routes . It also serve[MASK] as evacuation route from Cape May County to inland areas in the even[MASK] of a hurricane .

 The portion of current Route 50 between Seaville and Petersburg received fund[MASK]ng to become a sp[MASK]r of the O[MASK]ean Highway in 1910 . The modern @-@ day alignment o[MASK] Route 50 was legislated as part of pre @-@ 1927 [MASK]oute 14 in 1917 , a route[MASK]that was to run from Cape May to Egg Harbor City . In the 1927 New Jersey state highway renu[MASK]bering , the portion of pre @-@ 1927 Route 14 between Seaville and Eg[MASK] Harbor City was designated as Route 50 , the highest state route number assigned in [MASK]h[MASK] renumbering . Route 50 retained i[MASK]s current routing in the 1953 New Jersey state highway renumbering . A fr[MASK]eway was proposed for Route 50 around 1960 , running from the Garden State Parkway in Dennis Township north to US 30 in Mullica Township . This proposed freeway[MASK]was intended to provide economic development to the [MASK][MASK]gion as well as provi[MASK]e a be[MASK]ter route to the Jersey Shore resorts of Cape May County for travelers from the Delaware Valley . However , this freeway w[MASK]s canceled by the mid @-@ 1970s due to financial and environmental concerns as well as lack of traffic along Route 50 [MASK] On Novembe[MASK] 21 , 2008 , construction bega[MASK] on making the interchange with the Atlantic City Expressway a full interchange as pa[MASK]t of a series of improvements[MASK]set for the Atlantic City Expressway .

 = Air Rhodesia Flight 825 = 
 
 Air Rhodesia Flight 825 was a [MASK]cheduled passe[MASK]ger flight that was shot down by the Zimbabwe People 's Revolutionary Arm[MASK] ( ZIPRA ) on 3 Septem[MASK]er 1978 , during the Rhodesian [MASK]us[MASK] War . T[MASK]e aircraft involved , a [MASK]ickers[MASK]Viscount named the Hun[MASK]ani , was flying the last leg of Air Rhodesia 's regular scheduled service from Vict[MASK]ria Falls to[MASK]the capital Salisbury , via the resort town of Kariba . 
 Soon afte[MASK] Flight 825 took off , a group of ZIPRA guerrillas scored a direct [MASK]it o[MASK] its starboard wing with a Soviet @-@ made Strela 2 surface @-@ to @-@ air infrared homing missile , critically damaging the aircraft and forcing an emergency landing . An atte[MASK]pted belly landing in a cotton field just west of Karoi was foiled by an unseen ditch [MASK] which[MASK]caused the plane to cartwheel and break up . Of the 52 passengers and four crew , 38 died in this crash ; the insurgents then approached the wreckage , rounded up the 10 survivors they could see and massacred them with automa[MASK]ic gun[MASK]ire . Three passenger[MASK] survived by hiding in the surrounding bush , while a further five lived because[MASK]they had g[MASK]ne to look for[MASK]water[MASK]before the guerrillas arrived . 
 ZIP[MASK]A lea[MASK]er Joshua[MASK]Nkomo publicly claimed responsibility[MASK]for shooting down the Hunyani in an intervie[MASK] with the BBC 's Today programme the same evening , saying the aircraft had been used for military purposes , but denied that his men had killed survivors on the ground . The majority of Rhodesians , both black and white , saw the attack as an act of terrorism . A fierce white Rh[MASK]desian backlash followed against perceived enemies , with many whites[MASK]beco[MASK]ing violently resentful and suspici[MASK]us of blacks in general , even t[MASK]ough few black Rhodesians sup[MASK]orted attacks of this kind . Reports viewing the attack negatively a[MASK]p[MASK]ared in international journals such as Time magazine , but there was almost no acknowl[MASK]dgement of it by overseas governments , much to the Rhodesian government 's indignation .[MASK][MASK] Talks between Nkomo and Prime Minister Ian Smith , which had been[MASK][MASK]rogressing promisingly , were immediately suspended by the furious[MASK]Rhodesi[MASK]ns , with Smith calling Nkomo a " monster " . On 10 September , Smith announced the extensio[MASK] of martial law over selected areas . The Rhodesi[MASK]n Security Forces launched several retaliat[MASK]ry [MASK]trikes into[MASK]Zambia and Mozambique ove[MASK] th[MASK] following months , attacking bo[MASK]h ZIPRA and its[MASK]rival , th[MASK] Zimbabwe African National Liberation Army ( ZANLA ) . The attack on ZIPRA in particular brought great controversy as many of those killed were refugees camping in and around guerrilla positions . Five months later , in February 1979 , ZIP[MASK]A shot down Air Rhodesia Flight 827 , another civilian fl[MASK]ght , in an[MASK]almost identical incident . 
 
 = = Background = = 
 
 A dispute over the t[MASK]rms [MASK]or the granting of full sovereig[MASK]ty to the self @-@ gover[MASK]ing colony of Rhodesia ( or Southern Rhodesia ) led the colonial government , headed by Prime Minister Ian Smith , to[MASK]unilaterally declare independen[MASK]e from t[MASK]e United Kingdom on 11 November 1965 . The idea of " no in[MASK]ependence before major[MASK]ty rule " had recently gained ground in Britain and elsewhere amid decolonisation , and Rhodesia 's government was dominated by t[MASK]e country 's whi[MASK]e [MASK]inority , so the unilateral declaration went unrecognised internationally . Britain and the United Natio[MASK]s imposed economic sanctions on Rhodesia . 
 Two rival communist @-@ backed bla[MASK]k nationalist groups initiated military campaigns to overthrow the government and introduce majority rule : the Chinese @-@ aligned Zimbabwe African [MASK]ational Union ( ZANU ) , mostly comprising Shonas , created the Zimbabwe A[MASK]rican National Libe[MASK]ation Army ( ZANLA ) and adopted aspects of Maoist doctrine , while the Ndebe[MASK]e @-@ dominated Zimbabwe African Pe[MASK]ple 's Un[MASK]on [MASK] ZAPU ) , aligned with Soviet @-@ style Marxism – [MASK]eni[MASK]ism and the Warsaw Pact , mobilised the Zimbabwe People 's Revolutionary Army ( ZIPRA ) . These[MASK]guerrilla ar[MASK]ies pr[MASK]ceeded to wage what they called the " Second Chimurenga " against the Rhodesian government and security forces . The resulting conflict , the Rhodesi[MASK]n Bush War , began in ea[MASK]nest in December 1972 , when ZANLA attacked Altena and Whistlefield Fa[MASK]ms in north @-@ eastern Rhodesia . 
 After the security forces [MASK]oun[MASK]ed a successful counter [MASK]-@ insurgency campaign during 1973 and 1974 , developments overseas caused the conflict 's momentum to shift in the insurgents ' favour . The leftist Carn[MASK]tion Revolution of April 1974 caused Portugal[MASK]to withdraw its key economic [MASK]upport for Smith 's administration , and led to Mozambique 's independence the followi[MASK]g year as[MASK]a communist state openly allie[MASK] with ZANU . Around the same time , Rhodesia[MASK]'s other main backer , South Africa , adopted a détente initiati[MASK]e that forced a ceasefire , giving the guerrillas time to regroup . Following the abort[MASK]ve Vict[MASK]ria Falls Conference of August 1975 , Smith and the ZAPU leader Joshua Nkomo held unsuccessful talks between December 197[MASK] and March 1976 . ZANU a[MASK]d ZAPU announced in October 1976 , during the run @-@ up to the un[MASK]uccessf[MASK]l Geneva Conference[MASK]in December , that they would henceforth attend conferences as a joint " Patriotic Front " . 
[MASK]In March 1978 , Smith and non @-@ militant natio[MASK]alist groups headed by Bishop Abel Muzorewa , the Reverend Ndabaningi Sithole and Chief Jeremiah Chirau [MASK]greed what became th[MASK] " Internal Settlement " . This created a joint black – white transitional government , with the country due to be reconstituted as Zimbabwe Rhodesia in June 1979 , pursuant[MASK]to multiracial elections . ZANU and ZAPU were invited to participate , but refused ; Nkomo [MASK]ardonically dubbed Smith 's black colleague[MASK] " the blacksmiths " . ZANU proc[MASK]aimed 1978 to be " The Year of the People " as the war conti[MASK]ued .[MASK]Officia[MASK]s from Muzo[MASK]ewa 's United African National Co[MASK]ncil , sent to the provinces to explain the Internal Settlemen[MASK] to rural blacks , were killed by Marxist – Leninist guerril[MASK]as . Insurgents also began to targe[MASK] Christian [MASK]issionaries , climaxing in the killing of n[MASK]ne British missionaries and four childre[MASK] at Elim Mission ne[MASK]r the Mozambican border on 23 [MASK]une . 
 The transitional government was badl[MASK] received abroad , partly because t[MASK]e Internal Settlement kept control of law enforcement ,[MASK]the military , the ju[MASK]iciary and the civil service under white control . No[MASK]country r[MASK]cognised Rhodesia 's i[MASK]t[MASK]rim administration[MASK]. Smith again worked to bring Nkomo into t[MASK]e government , hoping this would lend it some credence domestically [MASK] prompt diplomatic[MASK]recognit[MASK]on overseas , and help the security forces defeat ZANLA . Starting on 14 August 1978 , he[MASK]attended secret meetings with Nkomo in Lusaka , Zam[MASK]ia ( where ZAPU was based [MASK] , doing s[MASK] with the assi[MASK]tance of the mining corporation Lonrho . Attempts were made to also involve [MASK]he ZANU leader Robert Mugabe , but Mugabe would ha[MASK]e no part in the talks . According to the South African military historian Jakkie Cilliers , negotiations between Smith and Nkomo progressed well and " seem[MASK]d on the verge of success " by the start of September 1[MASK]78 . On 2 September , Smith and Nkomo revealed publicly that the secret meetings had [MASK]aken place .

 Rhodesian air tr[MASK]ffic was not seriously threatened until about 19[MASK]7 , in the latter stages of the war ; before this time , neither revolutionary force had the weapons to launch a viable attack against an aerial target . The weapon that made such[MASK]attacks feasible for ZIPRA was the Strela 2 shoulder @-@ launched surface @-@ to @-@ air [MASK]issile launcher , supplied by the Soviet [MASK]nio[MASK] from the mid @-@ 1970s as [MASK]art of the Warsaw Pact 's materiel support . By September 1978 , there had been 20 reported attempts to shoot down Rhodesian military aircraft using these weapons , none of[MASK]whi[MASK]h had been successfu[MASK] . Some Rhodesia[MASK] Air Force Dakotas had been hit , but all had survived and landed safely . No civilian aircraft had yet been targeted[MASK]during the[MASK]Bush War .

 [MASK]ir [MASK]hodesia was the country 's national airline [MASK] established by the government on 1 September 1967 to succeed Central African Airw[MASK]ys , w[MASK]ich was d[MASK]ssolved at the end of that year . Based at Salisbury Airport , Air Rhodesia 's flight network during the late 1970s comprised a domestic programme of passenger and cargo[MASK]flights , as[MASK]well as international servic[MASK]s to the South African[MASK]cities of Johan[MASK]esburg and Durban . 
 The Flight 825[MASK]aircraft was a Vickers Visco[MASK]nt 78[MASK][MASK] , a British @-@ made turboprop aircraft with two engines on each wing . It was named the Hunyani aft[MASK]r the river of th[MASK] same name , which flowed between Lake Kariba and the Rhodesian capital Salisbury . 
 The Hunyani was on the[MASK]second and final leg o[MASK] its regular scheduled journey between Victoria Falls and Salisbury , stopping over in the resort town of Kariba . Despite the occasional rocket and mortar attacks l[MASK]unched on Kariba by ZIPRA guerrill[MASK]s on the northern side of the Zambezi ( in Zambia ) , the resort had endured as one of Rhodesia 's choice tourist destinations . The flight on 3 [MASK]eptember 19[MASK]8 , Sunday afternoon , from Kariba to Salisbury carried four crew members and 52 passengers , most of w[MASK]om were holidaymakers from Salisbury , returni[MASK]g home after a weekend at the lake . The flight took off from Kariba Airport on schedule soon after 17 : 00 Central Africa Time . 
 Flight 825 was piloted by 36 @-[MASK] year @-@ old Captain John Hood , a native of Bulawayo who had gained his commercial pilot licence in 1966[MASK]. He had flown Viscounts for Air Rhodesia since 1968 , and had also served in the Rhodesian [MASK]ir Force on a voluntary basis . His first officer , Garth Beaumont , was 31 y[MASK]ars old , and had lived in Rhodesia for most of his life , having i[MASK]migrated as a child from S[MASK]uth Africa . The two air stewardesses were Dulcie Esterhuizen , 21 years old [MASK]nd from Bulawayo , and 23 @-@ year @-@ old [MASK]ouise Pears[MASK]n , from Salisbury .

 A group[MASK]of ZIPRA guerrillas , armed with a Strela @-@ 2 launcher , waited in the bush beneath Flight 825 's flightpath , and fired on the Hunyani about five minutes after it took off , while the aircraft was still in the climb phase of[MASK]its flight . The hea[MASK] @-@ seeking[MASK]missile hit the plane 's starboard wing and exploded , causing the inner engine to also explode . A fuel tank and hydraulic lines ruptured , crea[MASK]ing a fire that the[MASK]pa[MASK]sengers and crew could not put out . The second starboard engine failed almost immediately , leaving Hood with only his t[MASK]o port eng[MASK]nes . Heaving wildly , the[MASK]Hunyani began to descend rapid[MASK]y . 
 At 17 : [MASK]0 Captain Hood sent a distress call to [MASK][MASK]r traffic control ,[MASK]in[MASK]orming them [MASK]hat he had lost t[MASK]e two sta[MASK]board engine[MASK] and was going to crash . " We 're going in , " he radioed . Telling his passengers to brace for an [MASK]mergency landing , he aimed for an open field of cotton in the Whamira Hills , in the bush to the west of[MASK]Kar[MASK]i , intending to belly land the craft . The landing was relatively stable unti[MASK][MASK]the Hunyani hit a previous[MASK]y unseen ditch , cartwh[MASK]eled and exploded . The remaining fuel tanks ruptured and caught fire , setting the wrecked cabin[MASK]ablaze .

 Of the 56 peop[MASK]e on board , 38 , including Hood and Beaumont , died in the crash . Eigh[MASK]een survived , albeit wit[MASK] in[MASK]uries , and cli[MASK]bed out of the w[MASK]eckage . After briefly settling the others , one of the passengers , Dr Cecil MacLaren , led four others — young newlyweds Robert and Shannon [MASK]argreaves , Mrs Sharon Coles , and her fo[MASK]r @-@ year @-@ old daughter Tracey — off in the direction of a nearby village in search of water . The other [MASK]3 remained close to the wreckage . Meanwhile , nine guerrillas made their way towards the crash site , and reached it at about 17 : 45 . Three of the 13 survivors remaining at the crash site hid on seeing figu[MASK]es approaching :[MASK]Rhodesian Ar[MASK]y reservist Ant[MASK]ony Hill , 39 , took cover in the surrounding bush , while businessman Hans Hansen and his wife Dian[MASK] did the same . This left 10 passengers in full view [MASK]ear the wreckage , inc[MASK]uding four women and two girls ( aged 11 and 4 ) . 
 T[MASK]e guerrillas , who were[MASK]armed with AK @-@ 47 rifles , presented themselves to the 10 passengers as friendly , saying they would summon help and bring water . The[MASK] spo[MASK]e in [MASK]nglish , both t[MASK] the[MASK]survivors and among themselves . They told the passengers to congregate around a p[MASK]int a few metres from the wreckage ; when the survivors sai[MASK] that some of them were too badly injure[MASK] to walk , the insurgents told the able @-@ bodied men to carry the others .[MASK]The passengers were assembled into an area of about 10 square metres ( 110 sq ft ) . Standing roughly 15 metres ([MASK]49 ft ) away , the cadres now raised[MASK]their weapons . " You have [MASK]aken our land , " one of them said . [MASK] Please don 't shoot us ! " one of the passengers [MASK]ried , just before they we[MASK]e killed by a sustained burst of automatic gunfire . 
 Having c[MASK]llected water from the nearby village , MacLaren and his companions were almost back at the crash site when they he[MASK]rd the shots . Thinking it was personal ammunition in the luggage exploding in th[MASK] heat , they continued on their way , and cal[MASK]ed out to the other passengers , who they t[MASK]ought were still alive . This alerted the ins[MASK]rgents to the presence of more survivors ; one of the guerrillas told MacLaren 's group to " come here " . The insurg[MASK]nts then opened fire on their g[MASK]neral location [MASK] prompting MacLaren and the others to flee . Hill and the Hansens also ran ; they revealed their positions to t[MASK]e fighters in their[MASK]haste , but success[MASK][MASK]lly hid themselve[MASK] behind a ri[MASK]ge . After Hill and the others ha[MASK] hidden there for about two hours , they saw the attackers return to the crash site at about 19 : 45 . The guerrillas looted the wrecked cabin and some of the suitcases stre[MASK]n around the site , filled their arms [MASK]ith various passengers ' belongings , then left again . 
[MASK]The survivors were found over the following days by the Rhodesian Army and police ; Hill and Mr and Mrs Hans[MASK]n were taken to Karib[MASK] Hospit[MASK]l , while MacLaren and his group were airlifted to Andr[MASK]w Fle[MASK]ing Hospital in[MASK]Salisbury[MASK]. 
 
 = = = Nkomo claims responsibility , but denies killing[MASK]survivors = = = [MASK] 
 Nkomo claimed responsibility for the attack in [MASK]n interview with the BBC 's Today radio[MASK]programm[MASK] the next day , laughing as he did so , to the horror of mos[MASK] Rhodesian observers , both black and white . He said that he had received intelligence that the Hunyani was being used for military purposes . Nk[MASK]mo said he re[MASK]retted the de[MASK]ths as it was not his party 's policy to kill civilians , and denied th[MASK]t his men had killed any s[MASK]rvivors on the ground ; by contrast , he s[MASK][MASK]d that his men had helped them , and had left them alive . He also accused Air Rhodesia of surreptitiously hauling troops and war materiel for t[MASK]e government , an alleg[MASK]tion that Captain Pat Travers , Air Rhodesia 's general manager , called a " downright , deliber[MASK]te lie " . 
 According to[MASK]Eliakim Sibanda , a professor and human rights speaker who wrote a history of ZAPU , Nkomo was implying that responsibility for t[MASK]e massacre actually lay with secur[MASK]ty force pseudo @-@ guerrillas , more specifically the mi[MASK]ed race Selous Scouts unit , which had often been accused of brutalising rural civ[MASK]lians with the goal of sh[MASK]fting public opinion . Sibanda asserts that the massacre " can[MASK]ot be put beyond " the Scouts , and also supports Nkomo 's claim that the Hunyani had been used militarily , s[MASK]ggesting that ZIPRA might have believed there to be Rhodesian sol[MASK]ier[MASK] on board . " Rhodesian television , before attacks on ZANLA in Mozambique , had shown Viscounts ferrying paratroopers for the job , " he write[MASK] , " ... [ [MASK]nd ] ZIPRA [MASK]ntelligence knew there were paratroopers stationed [ at Victoria Falls ] " .

 A r[MASK]port published in the American magazine Time a fortnight later descr[MASK]bed the incident as " a genuine horror story , calculated to make the most alarming of Rhodesian doomsday prophecies seem true . " I[MASK]deed , the white community in Rhodesia heard th[MASK] n[MASK]ws[MASK]with fury , and many turned their m[MASK]nds to exacting retribution for wh[MASK]t they and many others saw as an act of terrorism . The prominent Indian @-@ Rhodesian Gulab family was[MASK]p[MASK]rticularly affected by the inciden[MASK] , having lost eight members in the attack . Though Rhodesian authorities did not immediately acknowledge the cause of the crash , doing so only after four days ' investigation , the truth was common kn[MASK]wledge in Salisbury within hours . Smith wrote in his memoirs that the " degree of anger ... [ was ] difficult to contr[MASK]l " . White South Af[MASK]icans were [MASK]imila[MASK]ly enraged , part[MASK]cularly after reports appeared in the South African press that the killers had raped the female passengers before massacring [MASK]hem . A Fri[MASK]nds of Rhodesia Society in South Africa offered a reward of R100,000 to anybody who would either kill Nkomo or bring him to Salisbury to stand trial . 
 Geof[MASK]rey Nyarota , who was then one of the few black reporters at the Rhodesia Herald newspaper , later wrote in his memoirs that many whites became resentful and wary towards blacks in[MASK]general , bel[MASK]eving them all to be " t[MASK]rrorist sympathisers " . Describing the Herald newsroom t[MASK]e night of the incident , he relates a " vile collective temper " among the white sub @-@ editors : " They cursed until their voices beca[MASK]e hoarse , th[MASK]eatening dire consequences for all terrs and munts or ka[MASK]firs ... I sens[MASK]d that some of the more der[MASK]gatory[MASK]remarks made in unnecessarily loud voices that evening were meant s[MASK]ecifically for my ears . " 
 Seve[MASK]al racially motiv[MASK]ted incidents occurred over th[MASK] following days . According to the Time article , a group of whites entered an unsegregated Salisbury[MASK]bar " fingering the trig[MASK]ers of rifl[MASK]s " and forced blacks drinking there to leave . Time also reported a rumour that two white youths , on learning of the massacre[MASK], shot the first black man they [MASK]aw . Smith says that several would @-@ be vigilante gro[MASK]ps sought his permiss[MASK]on to ventur[MASK] into the bush around the crash site to " make the local people pay for[MASK]their crime of harbouring and assisting the te[MASK]rorists " . He instructed them not to , according to his memoirs , telling them that many rural blacks only assisted the guerrillas under ex[MASK]reme duress , and that it woul[MASK] not do to attack them . Many Rhodesians also resented the apparent lac[MASK] of sympathy [MASK]manating from overseas governments , especially considering the character o[MASK] the attack and its civilian target[MASK].

 At a memorial service held on 8 September 1978 for Flight 825 's passengers and crew at Salisbury 's Anglican Cathedral , about 2 @,@ 000 people crowded inside , with another 50[MASK] standing outside o[MASK] the steps and pavement , many listening to [MASK]he service inside on portable radio sets[MASK]. Prominent among those present in the cathedral were uniform[MASK]d Air Rhodesia and South African Airways personnel , as well as Rhodesian Special Air Service soldiers and sen[MASK]or officers from other military units .

 Dean John de Costa gave a sermon damning what he described as a " de[MASK]fening silen[MASK]e " from overseas .

 The talks between Smith and the ZAPU leader that had been progressing so promisingly were immediately[MASK]halted by Salisbur[MASK][MASK].

He surmises that an agreement between the two " at this critical stage " might have h[MASK]lped the transitional Rhodesian gov[MASK]rnment to secure international recognition[MASK]. 
 On 10 September , the Prime Minister announced to the nation that certain areas of the country would be place[MASK] under a variation of martial law , wh[MASK]ch [MASK]e said would be applied in particular regio[MASK]s as and when needed . He declared Rhodesia 's intent to " liquidate the internal workings o[MASK] those organisations associated with terrorism " , and warned neighbo[MASK]ring countries to prepare for " any defensive strikes we mig[MASK]t undertake " against guerrilla bases in their respective territories .

 Because ZAPU and ZIPRA were based in Zambia , many Rhodesians clamoured for a massive retaliator[MASK] strike against terrorist targets in that country , but the first external target hit by th[MASK] security forces followi[MASK]g the Viscount shootdown was the prominent cluster of ZANLA bases around Chimoio in Mozambique[MASK]. The Rhodesian military had struc[MASK] these bases extensively in Nove[MASK]ber 1977 dur[MASK]ng Operation Dingo , destroying much of the ZANLA presence there , but [MASK][MASK]e insurgents had sin[MASK]e built a complex called " New Chimoio " , slightly to the east ; the new camps were distributed acros[MASK] a far larger area than the originals . In[MASK]a combined airborne @-@ ground assault called Operation Snoopy , the Rhodesian Air Fo[MASK]ce ,[MASK]Rhodesian Light Infantry and Special Air Service wiped out much of New Chimoio on 20 September 1978 . Moz[MASK]mbique sent armo[MASK]r to ZANLA 's aid in the form of nine Soviet @-@ made T @-@ 54 tanks and four Russian BTR @-@ [MASK]52 armoured person[MASK]el carriers , but the former were r[MASK]u[MASK]ed and one of the latter destroyed by the Rhodesian security forces . According to Rhodesian fig[MASK]r[MASK]s , there were " several hundred " guerrillas killed , while the security [MASK]or[MASK]es lost only two soldiers , one o[MASK] whom was acc[MASK]den[MASK]ally killed by a friendly air strike .

 Rhodesia then attacked ZIPRA 's bases in Zambia , [MASK]n what Group Captain Peter Petter @-@ Bowyer later described as " payback time " for Flight 825 . Operation Gatling , launched on 19 Octo[MASK]er 1978 [MASK] wa[MASK] anothe[MASK] joint @-@ force operation betw[MASK]en the Air Force and the Army , which contributed Special Air Service and R[MASK]odesi[MASK]n Light I[MASK]fantry paratroopers . Gatling 's primary target , just 16 kilometres ( 10 [MASK]iles ) north[MASK]@-@ east of central Lusaka , was the formerly [MASK]hite @-@ owned Westlands[MASK]Farm , which had been transformed into ZIPRA 's main headquarters and t[MASK]aining base under the name " Freedom Camp " . ZIPRA presumed tha[MASK] Rho[MASK]esia would never dare to attack a site so close to Lusaka . About 4 @,@ 000 guerrillas underwent training at Freedom Camp , with senior ZIPRA staff also on site . The Rhodesian op[MASK]ration 's other targets were Chikumbi , 19 kilometres ( 12 miles ) north of Lusaka , and Mkushi Camp ; all three were to be attacked more or less simultaneously in [MASK] coordinated sweep[MASK]across Zambia . Assaulting targets deep inside Zambia was a first for t[MASK]e Rhodesian forces ; previously only guerril[MASK]as near the border had been att[MASK]cked . 
 Led by Squadron [MASK]eader Chris Dixon , who identified himself to Lusaka Airport tower as " Green[MASK]Leader " , a Rhodesian Air Force group flew into Zambia at very low altitudes ( thereby avoiding Zambian radar ) and took co[MASK]trol of the country 's airspace for about a quarter of an hour during the initial assault[MASK]on West[MASK]ands Farm , informing Lusaka [MASK]ower that the attack was against " Rhodesian dissidents , and not against Zambia " , and that Rhodesian Hawker Hunters were circling the Zambian airfields under orders to shoot down any[MASK]fighter that attempted to tak[MASK] off . The Zambians obeyed all of Green Leader 's in[MASK]tructions , made no attempt to re[MASK]ist and te[MASK]porarily halted civil air traffic . Using Rufunsa airstrip in eastern Zambia[MASK]as a forw[MASK]rd base , the Rhod[MASK]sian military suffered only minor casualties during the thr[MASK]e @-@ day o[MASK]eration , and afterwards c[MASK]aimed to have [MASK]illed over 1 @,@ 500 ZIPRA personnel , as w[MASK]ll as some Cuban instructors . 
 Historians Paul Moorcraft and Peter McLaughlin write that this exaggerated considerably the actual number of guerrillas killed , as most of Nkomo 's army , then numbe[MASK]ing about 10 @,@ 000 fighters , had not been touched . On the other hand , unarmed refugees [MASK]ften camped in or around insurgent positions , and hundreds of these had [MASK]een killed in the Rhodesian raid . M[MASK]orcraft and McLaughlin comment th[MASK]t for the Rhodesian airmen , it would have [MASK]een " impossible t[MASK] distinguish i[MASK]nocent refugees from young ZIPRA recruits . " Sibanda describes Freedom Camp as " a refugee camp for boys " , and says[MASK]" 351 boys and [MASK]irls " were killed . He claims that the Red Cross and the U[MASK] Refugee Agency " confirmed ZAPU 's claim that Smith 's forces struck at defen[MASK]eless , civilian trainees " . [MASK] 
 = = Aftermath = = 
 
 The Rhodesian att[MASK]ck[MASK] on ZANLA and ZIPRA bases did much to restore white morale follow[MASK]ng the Viscou[MASK]t incident , though they had not actually made much impact on the respective guerrilla campaigns . [MASK]komo and the Zambian Preside[MASK]t Kenneth Ka[MASK]nda all the sa[MASK]e requested[MASK]further military aid and better weapons fr[MASK]m the Soviets and the British respectively . Martial law was qu[MASK]ckly extended across Rh[MASK]desia 's r[MASK]ral areas , and[MASK][MASK]overed three @-@ quarters of the country by the end of 1978 . Air Rhodesia , meanwhile , began developing anti @-@ Strela shielding[MASK]for its Viscounts . Before this work was completed , ZI[MASK]RA shot down a second [MASK]iscount , Air Rhodesia Flight 827 , on [MASK]2 February 1979 . This time there were no s[MASK]rvivors . 
 Following the second shootdown , Air Rhodesia created a system whereby the underside of t[MASK]e Viscounts would be coated with low @-@ radiation paint , with the ex[MASK]aust [MASK]ipes conc[MASK]rrently sh[MASK]ouded . According to tests conducted by the Air Force , a Viscount so treated could not be detected[MASK]by the Strela 's target[MASK]ng system once it wa[MASK] over 2 @,@ 000 f[MASK]et ( 610 m ) .[MASK]There were no further Viscount shootdowns in Rhodesia . 
 In the elections held the following year[MASK]under the Internal Settlement terms , boycotted by ZANU and ZAPU , Muzorewa[MASK]won a majority , and became the first Prime Minister of the reconstituted [MASK] majority @-@ r[MASK]led state of Zimbabwe Rhodesia on 1 June 1979 . This new order failed to win international accept[MASK]nce , however , and in December 1979 the Lancaster House Agreement was agreed in London by Zimbabwe [MASK]hodesia , the UK government and the[MASK]Pat[MASK]iotic Front , returning the country to its former co[MASK]onial status . The[MASK]UK government suspended the consti[MASK]ution and took direct control for an[MASK]interim period . Fresh elections were won by Mugabe , who too[MASK] p[MASK]wer in April 1980 , concurrently with the country 's recognised independence as Zimbabwe .

 In m[MASK]dern Zimbabwe , it is not the Viscount shootdowns but rather the[MASK]retributory Rhodesian strikes against n[MASK]tionali[MASK]t guerrilla camps that endure predominantly in the cultural memory . State media in Zimbabwe , promi[MASK]en[MASK]ly the Herald newspaper , often c[MASK]aim that Rhodesian forces i[MASK]discriminately and deliberately slaughtered thousands of helpless refugees during [MASK]uch operations .[MASK]ZIPRA 's down[MASK]ng of civilian planes is meanwhile portrayed as a legitimate ac[MASK] of war on the grounds that the guerrillas might have believed them[MASK]to have military personnel or equipment on board . The [MASK]assacre of surviving Flight 825 passengers at the crash site is often omitted or attributed t[MASK] forces other than ZIPRA ; in his 1984 memoirs Nkomo repeated his claim that ZIPRA fighters had helped the survivors , and [MASK]rote [MASK][MASK]mply that [MASK] I truly have no idea how the ten died " . 
 A monument to those killed in the Rhodesian attack on C[MASK]ikumbi was built in Zambia[MASK]in 1998 , and de[MASK]icated join[MASK]ly by the Zambian and Zimbabwean governments . A memorial to the victims of the two Rhodesian Viscount incidents , dubbed the Viscount Memorial , was erec[MASK]ed on the grounds of the [MASK]oortrekker Monument in[MASK]Pretoria , South Africa in 2012 , and inaugurated on 1 September that year . The names of the dead[MASK]passengers and crew are engraved on two granite slabs that stan[MASK] upright , side by side , the pai[MASK] topped by an embl[MASK]m symbolising an aircraft .

Dumiso Dabengwa , a former ZIPRA commander , described[MASK]the move as a provocation motivated by race that went against the spirit of the amnesty enacted at [MASK][MASK]ncaster House . Christopher Mutsvangwa , a diplomat and political analyst , too[MASK] a similar line , calling Hoey 's proposed commemoration " a provocation ... [ tha[MASK] ] means they only regard the death of white people alone during the strugg[MASK]e . There is no mention of what happened to our sons a[MASK]d daughters in and outside the country . " ZAPU 's official response to Hoey 's motion included the assertion tha[MASK] in all conflicts " civilians [MASK]et c[MASK]ught up in cross @-@[MASK]fires due to faulty intelligence reports and other communication erro[MASK]s " , and juxtaposed the civilians killed in the Viscount shootdowns with those killed at Chikumbi .

 = Tikal = 
 
 Tikal ( / tiˈkäl / ) ( Tik ’ al in modern Mayan orthography ) is the ruins of a[MASK] ancient city found in a rainforest in Guatemala . Ambrosio Tut ,[MASK]a gum @-[MASK] [MASK]apper , reported the ruins to La G[MASK]ceta , a Guatemalan newspaper [MASK] which named the site Tikal . After the Berlin Academy of Sciences ' magazine republished the report in 1853 , archeologists and treasure hunters began visiting the forest . Today tourism to the[MASK]site may help protect the rainforest . It is one of the largest archaeological sites and urban centers of the pre @-@ Columbian Maya civilization . It is located in the archaeological region of the Petén Basin [MASK]n what is now northern Gu[MASK]temala . Situated in the department of El Petén , the site is part of Guatemala 's Tika[MASK] National Park and in [MASK]979 it was declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site . 
 Tikal was the capital of a conquest state t[MASK]at became one of the most pow[MASK]rful kingdoms of the ancient Ma[MASK]a . Though monumental arc[MASK]itecture at the site dates back as far as the 4th centur[MASK] BC , Tikal reached its apogee during the Classic Period , c . 200 to 900 AD [MASK] During this time , the city dominated m[MASK]ch of the Maya region politically , economically , and militarily , whi[MASK]e interacting wi[MASK]h areas throughout Mesoamer[MASK]ca such as t[MASK]e great metropolis of Teotihuacan in the distant Valley[MASK]of Mexic[MASK] . There is evidence that Tikal was conquered by Teotihuacan in the 4th ce[MASK]tury AD . Following the end of the Late Classic Period , no new major monuments were built at Tikal and there is evidence that elite palaces were burned . These events were coupled with a gradual population decline , culminating with the site ’ s abandonment by the end of the 10th century . 
 Tikal is the best understood of any of the large lowland Maya cities , with a long dynastic ruler list , the discovery of the tombs of many of the ru[MASK]ers on th[MASK]s list and the investigation of[MASK]their monuments , temples and palaces . 
 
 = = Etymology = = 
 
 The name Tikal may [MASK]e derived from ti ak 'al in the Yucatec Maya language ; it is said to be a relatively modern name meaning " at t[MASK]e waterhole " . Th[MASK] name was apparently applied to one of the site 's ancient reservoirs by hunters and travelers in the region . It has alternatively been interpreted as meaning " the place of the voices " in [MASK]he Itza Maya language[MASK]. Tika[MASK] , however , is[MASK]not the ancient name for[MASK]the site but rather[MASK]the name adopted shortly after its discovery in the 1840s . H[MASK]eroglyphic inscription[MASK] at the ruin[MASK] refer to th[MASK] ancient city as Yax Mut[MASK]l or Yax Mutul , meaning " First Mutal " [MASK] Tikal may have come to have been called this because Dos Pilas also ca[MASK]e to use the same emblem [MASK]lyph ; the rulers of the city presumably wanted to distinguish themse[MASK]ves as the first city to bear the name . The kingdom as a whole was s[MASK][MASK]ply called Mutul , which is the reading of the " hair bundle " emblem glyph seen in the accompanying pho[MASK]o . Its precise meaning remains obscure . 
 
 = = Location = = 
 
 The c[MASK]osest large modern settlements are Flores and Santa Elena , approximately 64 kilometres ( 40 [MASK]i ) by road t[MASK] the southwest . Tikal is approximately 303 kilometres ( 188 mi ) north of Guatemala[MASK]City . It is 19 kilometres ( 12 mi ) south of the contemporary [MASK]aya city of Uaxa[MASK]tun and 30 kilometres ( 19 mi ) northwest of Yaxha . The city was locat[MASK]d 100 kilometres ( 62 mi ) southeast of its great Class[MASK]c Period rival , Calakmul , and 85 kilometres ( 53 [MASK]i ) northwest of Calakmul 's ally Caracol , now in [MASK]elize . 
 The city has been completely mapped and covered an area greater[MASK]than 16 squ[MASK]re kilometres ( 6 @.@ [MASK] sq mi ) that included about 3 [MASK],@ 000 structures . The topography of the site consists [MASK]f a series [MASK]f parallel limestone ridges rising above swampy lowlands . The major architecture of the sit[MASK] is clustered upon areas of higher ground and linked by raised causeways spanning the swam[MASK]s . The area around Tika[MASK] has been dec[MASK]ared as the Tikal National Park and the p[MASK]eserved area covers 570 square kilometres ( 220 sq mi ) . 
 The ruins lie among the tropical rain[MASK]orests of northern Guatemala that formed the cradle of lowland Maya civilization . The city itself was located a[MASK]ong a[MASK]undant fertile upland soils , and may have dominated a natural east[MASK]– west trade route across the Yucatan Peninsula . Conspicuous trees a[MASK] the Tikal park include giga[MASK][MASK]ic kapok ( Ceiba pentandra ) the[MASK]sacred tree of the Maya ; tropical cedar ( Cedrela odorata ) , and Honduras mahogany ( Swietenia macrophylla ) . Regarding the fauna , agouti , white @-@ nosed coatis , gray foxes , Geoff[MASK]oy 's spider monke[MASK]s , howler monkeys ,[MASK]harpy eagles , falc[MASK]ns , ocellate[MASK] turkeys , guans , toucans , green parrots and leafcutter a[MASK]ts can be seen there regularly . Jaguars , jaguarundis , and cougars are also said to roam in the park . For centuries this city was compl[MASK]te[MASK]y covered under jung[MASK]e . The average annual rainfall at Tikal i[MASK] 1 @,@ 945 millimetres ( 76 @.@ 6 in ) . 
 One of the largest of the Cla[MASK]sic Maya cities , Tikal had no[MASK]water other than what was collected from rainwater and stored in te[MASK] reservoirs . Arch[MASK]eologists working in Tikal during the 20th century refurbis[MASK]ed[MASK]one of these an[MASK]ient r[MASK]servoirs to store water for their own use . 
 The Tikal National Park covers an are[MASK] of 575 @.@ 83 square kilometres ( 222 @.@ 33 sq mi ) . It was cre[MASK]ted on 26 May 1955 unde[MASK] the auspices of the Instituto de Antropología e H[MASK]storia and was the first protected area in Guatemala . 
 
 = = Population = = 
 
 Population[MASK]estimates for Tikal vary from 10 @,@ 000 to as high as 90 [MASK],@ 000 inhabitants , with the most likely figure being at the upper end of this range . 
 The population of Tikal began a continuous curve[MASK]of growth starting in the Preclassic Period ( approximately 2000 BC – AD[MASK]200 )[MASK], with a peak in the Late Classic with the population growing rapidly from AD 700 th[MASK]ough to 830 , followed by a sharp de[MASK]line . For the 120 square kilometres ( 46 sq mi ) area falling within the earthwork defenses of the hinterland , the peak population is estimated at 517 per sq[MASK]are kilometer ( 1340 per square mile ) . In an area within a 12 kilometres ( 7 @.@ 5 mi ) radius of the site core , p[MASK]ak popula[MASK]ion[MASK]is estimated at 120 @,@ 00[MASK] ; populati[MASK]n density is [MASK]stimated at 265 per square kilometer ( 689 per square mile ) . In a region w[MASK]thin a[MASK]25 kilometres ( [MASK]6 mi ) radius of the site core and including some satellite[MASK]sites , peak population is estimated at 425 @,@ 000 with a density of[MASK]216 per square kilometer ( 515 per square mile ) . These population figures [MASK]re even more impressive because of the extensive swamplands that were unsuitable for habitation[MASK]or agriculture . However , some archaeologists , such as Dav[MASK]d Webster , believe these fi[MASK]ures to be far too high .

 There are [MASK]races of early agriculture at the site datin[MASK] as far back as 1000 BC , in the Middle Preclassic . A cache of Mamon cerami[MASK]s dating from about 700 @-@ 400 BC were found in a sealed chultun , a subterranean bottle @-@ shaped chamber . 
 Major construct[MASK]on at Tikal was already taking place in the Late Preclassic period , first appearing around 400 – 300 BC , including t[MASK]e [MASK]uilding of major pyramids and p[MASK]atforms , although the city was still dwarfed by sites f[MASK]rther north such as El Mirador and Nakbe . At this time [MASK] Tika[MASK] participated in the widespread Chikan[MASK]l cu[MASK]ture that domi[MASK]ated the Central and Northern[MASK]Maya areas at this time – a region that included the entire Yucatan Peninsula including northern and eastern Guatemala and all of Belize . 
 Two temples dating to Late Chikanel times had [MASK]asonry @-@ walled superstructu[MASK]es that may have been corbel @-@ vaulted , altho[MASK]gh this has not been[MASK]proven . One of these had elaborate paintings on the outer wal[MASK][MASK] showing human figures against a scrollwork background , pain[MASK]ed in yellow , black , pink and red . 
 In the 1st century AD rich burials first appeare[MASK] and Tikal underwent a political and cultural florescence as its giant northern nei[MASK]hbors declined[MASK]. At the [MASK]nd [MASK]f the Late Preclassic , the Izapan style art and architecture from the Pacific Coast began to influence Tikal , as demonstrated by a broken sculpture from the acropolis an[MASK] early murals at the city . 
 
 = = = E[MASK][MASK]ly Classic = = = 
 
 Dynastic rulership among the lowland May[MASK] is most deeply rooted at Tik[MASK]l . According to later h[MASK]erogly[MASK]hic records , the dynasty was founded by Yax @-@ Moch @-@ Xoc , perhaps in the 3rd century AD . At the beginning of the Early Classic , power in the Maya region was concentrat[MASK]d at Tikal and Calakmul , in the core of the Maya heartland [MASK] 
 Tik[MASK]l may have benefited [MASK]rom the co[MASK]la[MASK]se of the large Preclassic states such as El Mirador . In the Early Classi[MASK] Tikal rapidly dev[MASK]loped into the most dynamic city in the Maya region , sti[MASK][MASK]lating the dev[MASK]lopment of other nearby Maya cities . 
 The site , however , was often at war and[MASK]inscriptions tell of alliances and conflict with other Maya states , including Uaxactun , Caracol , Naranjo and Calakmul . The site was defeated at the[MASK]end of the Early Classic by Caracol , which rose to take Tikal 's place as the paramount center in the southern Maya lowlands . The earlier part of the Ea[MASK]ly Classic saw hostilities between Tikal and its nei[MASK]hbor Uaxactun , with Uaxactun recording the capture of prisoners[MASK]from Tikal . 
 There appears to have been a b[MASK]eak[MASK]own in the male succession by AD 317 , when Lady Unen Bahlam conducted a katun @-@ ending ceremony , apparently as queen of the ci[MASK]y . 
 
 = = = = Tika[MASK] and T[MASK]otihuacan = = = = 
 
 The fourteenth [MASK]ing of Tikal was Chak Tok Ich 'aak ( Great Jaguar Paw ) . Chak Tok Ich 'aak built a palace that was preserved and developed by later rulers until it became the core of the Central Acropolis . Little is known[MASK]about Chak Tok Ich 'aak except that he was killed o[MASK] 14 January 378 AD . On the s[MASK]me day , Siyah K ’ ak ’ ( Fir[MASK] Is Born ) arrived from the west , having passe[MASK] through El [MASK]e[MASK]u , a site to the west of Tikal[MASK], on 8 January . On Stela 31 he is named as " Lord of the West " . Siyah K [MASK] ak ’ was probably a foreign general serving a figure represented [MASK]y a non @-@ Maya hieroglyph of a spearthrower combined with an owl , a gly[MASK]h that is well known from the great metropolis of Teotihuacan in the distant Valley of Mexic[MASK] . Spearthrower Owl may even have been the ruler of Teotihuacan . These recorded events strongly suggest that Siyah K ’ ak ’ led a Teotihuacan invasion t[MASK]at defeated the native Tikal king , who was captured and immediately executed . Siyah K 'ak ' appears to have been aided by a powerful political faction at Tikal itself ; roughly at the time of the conquest , a group of Teotihuacan[MASK]natives wer[MASK] apparently residing near the Lost Worl[MASK] complex [MASK] He also exerted control over other cities in[MASK]the area , incl[MASK]di[MASK]g Uaxactun , where he became king , but did not take t[MASK]e throne of Tikal for himself . Within a year , the son of Spearthrower Owl by[MASK]the name of Yax Nuun Ayiin I ( First Crocod[MASK]le ) had been installed as the tent[MASK] king of Tikal while he was still a boy , being enthroned on 13 September 379 . He reigned for 47 years as king of Tikal , and remai[MASK]ed a vassal of Siyah K 'a[MASK] ' for as long as the latter lived . It seems[MASK]likely that Yax Nuun Ayiin I took a wife from the preexist[MASK]ng , defeated [MASK] Tikal dynasty and thus legitimized[MASK]the right to rule of his son , Siyaj Chan K 'awiil II . 
 Río [MASK]zul , a small site 100 kilometres ( 62 mi ) northeast of Tikal , was conqu[MASK]red by the latter during the reign of Yax Nuun Ay[MASK]in I. The site became an outpost of Tikal , shielding [MASK]t from hostile cities further nort[MASK] , and also became a trade link to the Caribbean . 
 Although the new rulers of Tikal were foreig[MASK] , t[MASK]eir descendants were r[MASK]pidly Mayanized . Tikal became the key ally and tr[MASK]ding partner of Teotihuacan in the Maya lowlands . After being conquered by Teot[MASK]huacan , Tikal rapidly dominated the northern[MASK]and eastern Peten . Uaxactun , together wit[MASK] smaller towns[MASK]in the region , were absorbed into Tikal 's kingdom . Other sites , [MASK]uch as Bejucal and Motul de S[MASK]n José near Lake Petén Itzá became vassals of their more powerful neighbor to the [MASK]orth . By the [MASK]iddle of th[MASK] 5th century Tikal had a core territory of at [MASK]east 2[MASK] kilometres ( 16 mi ) in every direction . 
 Around the 5th century an impressive system of [MASK]ortifications consisting of ditches and earthworks was built along the northern periphery of Tikal 's hint[MASK]rland , joining up with the natural defenses provided by large areas of swampland lying to the east and west of the city . Additional fortifications were probably also built to[MASK]the south . These defenses protected Tikal 's core population and agricultural[MASK]resources , encirclin[MASK] an area of appr[MASK]ximately[MASK]120 square kilometres ( 46 sq mi ) . Recent research suggest[MASK] that the eart[MASK]works served as a water collection system rather than a defe[MASK]sive purpose . 
 
 = = = = Tikal and Copán = = =[MASK]= 
 
 In the 5th century t[MASK]e power of the city reached as far sout[MASK] as Copán , whose founder K 'inich Yax K 'uk ' Mo ' was clearly connected with Tikal . Copán itself was not in an ethnically Maya region[MASK]and the founding of the Copán dynasty probably involved the direct intervention of Tikal . K '[MASK]nich Yax K 'uk ' Mo ' arrived in Co[MASK]án in December 426 and b[MASK]ne analysis of his remains shows that he [MASK]assed his childhood and youth at Tikal . An individual known as Aj[MASK]w K 'uk ' Mo [MASK][MASK]( lord K 'uk '[MASK]Mo[MASK]' ) is referred to in an early text[MASK]at Tikal and may well be the same person . His tomb had Teotihuacan characteristics[MASK]and he was depicted in later portr[MASK]its dressed in the warrior garb of Teotihuacan . Hierogly[MASK]hic texts refer to him as " Lord of the West " , much like Siyah K ’ ak ’ [MASK] At the same time , in la[MASK]e [MASK]26 [MASK] Copán founded the nearby[MASK]site of Quiriguá ,[MASK]p[MASK]ssibly sponsored by Tikal itself . The founding o[MASK] these two centers may have been part of an effort to impose T[MASK]kal 's a[MASK]thority upon the southeastern portion of the Maya region . The interaction between these sites and Tikal was intense over the next t[MASK]ree centuries . 
 A long @-@ running rivalry between Tikal and Cala[MASK]mul b[MASK]gan in the 6th[MASK]century , with each of the two cities forming its o[MASK]n network of mutually hostile alliances arrayed against each other in what has b[MASK]en likened to a long @-@ running war b[MASK]tween two Maya superpowers .[MASK]The kings of these two capitals adopted the title kaloomte ' , a term that has not been precisely [MASK]ranslated but that [MASK]mplies some[MASK]hing akin [MASK]o " high king " . 
 The early 6th [MASK]entury saw another queen ruling the city , known only as the " Lady of Tikal [MASK] , who was very likely a d[MASK]ughter of Chak Tok Ich 'aak II . She seems never to[MASK]have ruled in her own right , rather being partnered wi[MASK]h male co @-@ rulers . The first of these was Kaloomte ' B 'alam , who see[MASK]s to have had a long caree[MASK] as a general at Tikal before becoming co @-@ ru[MASK]er and 19th in the dynastic sequ[MASK]nce . The Lady of Tikal [MASK]erself seems n[MASK]t have been counted in the dynastic numbering . It appears she was later paired with lord [MASK] Bird Cla[MASK] " , who is presumed to [MASK]e the otherwise unknown 20th ruler [MASK] .

 = = = = Tikal hiatus = = = [MASK] 
 
 In the mid 6th century , Caracol see[MASK]s to have allied with Calakmul and defeated Tikal , cl[MASK]sing the Early Classic . The " Ti[MASK]al hiatus " refers to a period between the late 6th to late 7th century wh[MASK]re t[MASK]ere was a lapse in the writing of inscriptions and large @-@ scale construction at Tikal . In the latter half of the 6th [MASK]entu[MASK]y[MASK]AD , a serious crisis befell the city , with no new stelae being erected and with widespread deliberate mu[MASK]ilati[MASK]n of public sculpture . This hiatus in activity at Tikal was long unexplained until later epigraphic decipherments identified that the period was prompted by Tikal 's [MASK]omprehensive defeat at the hands of Calakmul and the Caracol polity in AD 562 , a defeat that seems to have resulted in the capture [MASK]nd sacrif[MASK]ce of the king of Tikal . The badly eroded Altar 21 at Caracol described how Tikal suffered this disastrous defeat in a major war in April 562 . It seems that Caracol was an ally of Calakmul in the wider conflict between that city and Tikal , with the defeat of Tikal having a lasting impact upon the city . Tikal was not sacked but its [MASK]ower and influence were broken . After its[MASK]great[MASK]victory , Caracol grew rapidly and some [MASK]f Tikal 's population may have been forcibly [MASK]elocated there . During the hiatus period , at least one ruler of T[MASK]kal took refuge with Janaab ' Pakal of Palenque , another of Calakmul 's victims . Calakmul itself thr[MASK]ved during Tikal 's long h[MASK]atus period . 
 The beginning of the Tikal hiatus has served as a marker by which a[MASK]chaeolo[MASK]ists commonly subdivide the Classic period of Mesoamerican chronology into the Early and Late Classic . 
 
 = = = = Tikal and Dos Pilas = = = = 
 
 In 629 Tikal founded Dos Pilas , some 110 kilometres ([MASK]68 mi ) to the southwest , as a military outp[MASK]st in order to control tra[MASK]e along the cour[MASK]e of the Pasión River . B 'alaj Chan K 'awiil was installed on the throne of the new outpost at [MASK]he [MASK]ge of four , in 635 , and for many years served as a loyal vass[MASK][MASK] fighting for his brother [MASK] [MASK]he king of Tikal .[MASK]Roughly[MASK]twenty years later Dos Pilas was attacked by Calakmul and was soundly defeated . B 'alaj Chan K 'awiil was capt[MASK]red by the king of Calakmul but , instead of being sacrifi[MASK]ed , he was re @-@ inst[MASK]ted on his throne as a vassal of his former enemy , and attack[MASK]d Tikal in[MASK]657 , forcin[MASK] Nuun Ujol Chaak , the then king of Tikal , to temporarily abandon the city . The fir[MASK]t two rulers of Dos Pilas continued to use the Mutal emblem glyph [MASK]f Tikal , and t[MASK]ey probably felt that they had a legitimate c[MASK]aim to the throne of Tikal itself . For some r[MASK]ason , B[MASK]'alaj Chan K 'awiil was not installed as the new ruler of Tikal ; [MASK]nstead he stayed at Dos Pilas . Tikal co[MASK]nterattacked against Dos Pilas in 672 , driving B 'alaj Chan K 'awiil into an exile that lasted five years . Calakmul trie[MASK] to [MASK]ncircle Tikal within an area dominated by its allies , such as El Peru , Dos Pilas and Cara[MASK]ol . 
 In 682 , Jasaw[MASK]Chan K 'awiil I erected the first dated monument at Tikal in 120[MASK]years and claimed the[MASK]title of kaloomte ' , so ending the hiatus . He initiated a programme of new [MASK]onstruction and turned t[MASK]e tables on Calakmul when , in 695 , he capt[MASK]red the enemy noble and threw the enemy state i[MASK]to a[MASK]long decline from which it never fully [MASK]ecovered . After this , Calakmul never aga[MASK]n erected a monument celebrating a military vict[MASK]ry . 
 
 [MASK] = = = Tikal after Teo[MASK]ihuacán = = = =[MASK]
 
 By the 7th century , there was no activ[MASK] Teoti[MASK]uacan presence at any Maya site and the center of Teotihuacan had[MASK]been razed by 700 . Even af[MASK]er this[MASK], formal [MASK]ar attire illustrated on monuments was Teotihuacan style . Jasaw Chan K 'awiil I and his heir Yik 'in Chan K 'awiil continued hostilities against Ca[MASK]akmul and its allies and imposed firm regional [MASK]ontrol ove[MASK] the[MASK]area around Tikal , e[MASK]tending as far as the territory around Lake Pe[MASK]én I[MASK]zá . These two ru[MASK]ers were responsible for much of the impressive architecture visible today . 
 In 738 , Quiriguá , a vassal of Copán [MASK] Tikal 's key ally in the south , switched allegiance to Cala[MASK]mul , defeated Copán and gained its own ind[MASK]pendence . It appears that this was a conscious effort on the part of[MASK]Calakmul to bring[MASK]about the collapse of Tikal 's southern allies . This upset the balance of power in the southern Maya area and l[MASK]ad to a steady decline in the [MASK]ortu[MASK]es of Copán . 
 In th[MASK] 8th century , the rulers of Tikal collected monuments from across the city and erected them in front of[MASK]the North Acropolis . [MASK]y the late 8th century and early 9th century , activity at Tikal slowed . Impressive architect[MASK]re was still built but [MASK]ew hieroglyphic inscriptions refer to later rulers . 
[MASK]
 = = =[MASK]Terminal Classic = = = 
 
 By the 9th century , the crisis of the Classic Maya collapse was sweeping across the region , with populations plummeting and city after city falling into silence . Increasingly endemic warfare in the Maya region caused Tikal[MASK]'s supporting population to heavily concentrate close [MASK]o the city itself , accelerating t[MASK]e[MASK]use of intensive agriculture and corresponding environmental decline . Construction continued at the beginning[MASK]of the century , wi[MASK]h the erection of Temple 3 , [MASK]he last of th[MASK] city 's major pyramids and t[MASK]e erection of monuments to mark the 19th K 'atun in 810 . The beginning of the 10th [MASK]ak 'tun in 830 passed unce[MASK]ebrated , and marks the beginning of a 60 @-@ year hiatus , probabl[MASK] resulting from the collapse of central control in th[MASK] city . During this hiatus , satellite sites traditio[MASK]ally under Tikal 's control began to er[MASK]c[MASK] their own monume[MASK]ts featuring local ru[MASK]er[MASK] and using the Mutal emblem glyph , with Tikal apparently lacking the authority or the[MASK]power to crush these bids for[MASK]independence . In 849 , Jewel K 'awiil is mentioned [MASK]n a stela at Seibal as v[MASK]siting that city as the Divine Lord [MASK]f Tikal but he is not re[MASK][MASK]rded el[MASK]ewhere and T[MASK]kal 's once great power was little more th[MASK]n a memory . The sites of Ixlu and Jimbal had by now inherit[MASK]d the once exclusi[MASK]e Mutal emblem glyph . 
 As Tikal and its hinterlan[MASK] reached[MASK]peak populati[MASK]n , the area suf[MASK]er[MASK]d deforestation , erosion[MASK]and nutrient [MASK][MASK]ss followed [MASK]y a rapid decline in population lev[MASK]ls . Tikal and its im[MASK]ediate surroundings seem to have lost[MASK]the major[MASK]ty of its population during the period from 830 to 950 and central authority seems to have collapsed rapidly . There is not much evidence from Tikal that the city was directly affected [MASK]y the endemic warfare that afflicted parts of the Maya region during the Terminal Classic , although an influx of refugees from the Petexbatún region may have exacerbated problems resulting from the already stretched environmental resources . 
 In the latter half of the 9th cent[MASK]ry there was an attempt[MASK]to revive royal power at the much dimini[MASK]hed city of Tikal , as evidenced by a stela er[MASK]cted in the Great Plaza by Jasaw Chan K 'awiil II in 86[MASK] . This was the last monument erected at Tikal be[MASK]ore the ci[MASK]y finally fell into silence . The former satellites [MASK]f Tikal , such as Jimbal and Uaxactun , did not last [MASK]uch longer , erecting their final monuments in 889 [MASK] By the end of the 9th century the vast majority of Tikal 's population had deserted the city , its royal pa[MASK]aces were occupied by squ[MASK]tters and simple thatched dwellings were being erected in the city 's ceremonial plazas . The squatters bloc[MASK]e[MASK] some doorways in the rooms they reoccupie[MASK] in the m[MASK]numental structures of the site and left rubbish that included a mixture of domestic refuse and non @-@ utilit[MASK]rian items such as musical instr[MASK]ments . These inhabitan[MASK]s reused the earlier monuments for their own ritual activities far removed from those of the[MASK]royal dynasty that had erected them . Some monuments were vandalized and some were moved to new locations . Before its final abandonment all respect for the o[MASK]d rulers had disappeared , with the to[MASK]bs of the North Acropolis being expl[MASK]red[MASK]for jade a[MASK]d the easier to find tombs being looted . After 950 , Tikal was all but deserted , although a remn[MASK]nt population may have survived in [MASK]erisha[MASK]le huts interspersed among the rui[MASK]s . Even these fi[MASK]al inhabitants abandoned the city in the 10th or 11th centuries and the rainforest claimed the ruins for the next thousand years . Some of Tikal 's population may have migrated to the Peten Lakes region , which remained heavily populated in spit[MASK] of a plunge in population levels in the first half of the 9th century . 
 [MASK]he most likely cause [MASK]f collapse at Tikal is [MASK]verpopulation and agra[MASK]ian failure[MASK]. The fall of Tikal was a blow to the heart of C[MASK]assic Maya civilization , the city having been at the forefront of courtly life , art and arch[MASK]tecture for over a thousand years , with an ancient ruling[MASK]dynasty . However , new research regarding paleoenvironmental proxies from the Tikal reservoir system suggests that a meteorological drought may have led[MASK]to the abandonment of T[MASK]kal .

 In 1525 , the Spanish conquistador Hernán Cortés passed within a few[MASK]kilometres of the ruins of Tikal but did not mentio[MASK] them in his letters . After Spanish friar[MASK]Andrés de Avendaño became lost in the Petén forests [MASK]n early 1696 he [MASK]escribed a ruin that may well have been Tikal . 
 As is often the case with huge ancient ruins , knowledge of the site was never completely lost in the region . It se[MASK]ms that loca[MASK] people [MASK]ever forgo[MASK] about Tikal and they guided Guatem[MASK]lan expeditions to the rui[MASK]s in the 1850s . Some second- or third @-@ hand accounts of Tikal appeared in print starting in the 17th century , continuing through the writings of John Lloyd Stephens in the early 19th c[MASK]ntury ( Step[MASK]ens and his illustrator Frederick Catherwood heard[MASK]rumors of a lost city , with white build[MASK]ng tops towering above the jungle[MASK], during their 1839 @-@ 40 travels in the region ) . Becaus[MASK] of the site 's remotene[MASK]s from modern towns , however , no explorers visited Tikal until Modesto Méndez and Ambrosio Tu[MASK] , respectively the commissioner and the governor of Petén , visited it in 1848 . Artist Eusebio Lara accompanied them and th[MASK]ir account was published in Germany in 1853 . Several other expeditions came to further investigate , m[MASK]p , and photograph Tikal in the 19th century ( including Alfred P. Maudslay in 1881 @-@ 82 ) and the early 20th century . Pioneering archaeologi[MASK]ts [MASK]tarted to clear , map and record the ruins in the 1880s . 
 In 1951 , a small airstrip was built at the ruins , which previous[MASK]y could only be reached by several days ' travel through the jungle on foot or mule . In 1956 the Tikal project began to [MASK]ap the city on a scale not previously seen in the Maya area . From 1956 through 1970 , major archaeological excavations were carried out by the University of Pennsylvania Tikal Project . They mapped much of the si[MASK]e and e[MASK]cavated [MASK]nd restored many of the structure[MASK] . Excavati[MASK]ns directed by Edwin M. Shook and later by William [MASK]oe of the un[MASK]versity investigated the North Acropolis and the Central Plaza from 19[MASK]7 to 196[MASK][MASK]. The Tikal Project recorded over 200 monuments at the site . In 1979 , the Guatemalan government began a further archeological[MASK]project at Tikal , which continued through to[MASK]1984 . 
 Filmmaker George Lucas used[MASK]Tikal as a filming location for the first Star Wars film , Episode IV : A New Hope [MASK] released in 1977 . Temple I at Tikal was featured on the reverse of the 50 centavo banknote . 
 Tikal is now a major tourist attraction sur[MASK]ounded by its own national park . A site museum has been built at Tikal ; it was completed in 1964 . 
 
 = = Site description = = 
 
 Tikal has been partially restored by the University of Pennsylvania and t[MASK]e government of Guatemala . It was one of the largest of the Classic p[MASK]riod Maya cities and was one of the largest cities in the Americas . The architecture of the ancient city[MASK]is b[MASK]ilt from limestone and [MASK]ncludes the remains of temples that tower over 70 metres ( 230 ft ) high , large royal palaces , in addition to a number of sma[MASK]ler pyramids , palaces [MASK] residences , administrative buildings , platforms and inscribed stone monuments . There is even a building which seemed to have been a jail , originally with wooden bars acro[MASK]s the windows and doors . There are also seven courts for playing the Mesoamerican ballgame , including a set of 3 in the Seven Temples Plaza , a unique feature in Mesoamerica [MASK] 
 The limestone used for construc[MASK]ion was local and quarried on @-@ site . The depressions formed by the extraction of stone for building were plastered to waterproof them and were used as reservoirs , together with some waterproofed natural depressions . The main plazas were surfaced with stucco and laid at a gradient that channelled rainfall into a system of canals [MASK][MASK]at fed the reservoirs . 
 The residential are[MASK] of Tikal covers an estimated 60 square kilometres ( 23 sq mi ) ,[MASK]much of which[MASK]ha[MASK][MASK]not yet been cleared , mapped , or excavated . A huge set of earthworks discovered by Dennis E. Puleston and Donald Callender in the 1960s rings Tikal with a 6 @-@ metre ( 20 [MASK]t ) wide trench behind a rampart . The 16 square kilometres ( 6 @.@ 2 sq mi ) area around the site core has been intensively mapped ; it may have enclosed an area of some 125 square kilometres ([MASK]48 [MASK]q[MASK]mi ) ( see below ) . Population estimates place the demographic size of the site between 10 @,@ 0[MASK]0 and 90 @,@ 000 , and possibly 425 @,@ 000 in the surrounding area . Recently , a project exploring the defensive earthworks has shown that the scale of the earthwor[MASK]s is highly variable and that in many places it is inconsequen[MASK]ial as a defensive feature . In addition , some parts of the earthwork were integrated into a canal system . The earthwork of Ti[MASK]al varies significantly in coverage from what was originally proposed and it is much more complex and multifaceted than originally thought . 
 
 = = = Causeways = = = 
 [MASK] By the Late Classic , a ne[MASK]work of sacbeob ( cau[MASK]eways ) linked various parts of the city , running for several ki[MASK]ometres through its urban [MASK]ore . The[MASK]e linked the Great Plaza with Temple 4 ( located about 750 metres ( 2 @,@ 460 ft ) to the west ) and the Temple of the Inscrip[MASK]ions ( about 1 kilometre[MASK]( 0 @.@ 62 m[MASK] ) to the southeast ) . These bro[MASK]d causeways were built of pac[MASK]ed and plastered limestone and have been named after early explorers and[MASK]archaeologists ; th[MASK] Maler , Maudslay , Tozzer and Méndez causewa[MASK]s . They assiste[MASK] the passage everyday traffic during the rain[MASK]season and also served as dams . [MASK] The Maler Causeway runs north from behind Temple I to Group H. A large bas @-@ relief is carved onto limestone bedrock upon the course of the causeway just south of Group H. It d[MASK]picts two bound captives and dates to the Late Classic . 
 The Mauds[MASK]ey Causewa[MASK] runs 0 @.@ 8 kilometres ( 0 @.@ 50 mi ) northeast from [MASK]emple IV t[MASK] Group H. 
 The Mendez Cau[MASK]eway runs southeast[MASK]from the East Plaza to Temple [MASK]I , a distance [MASK]f[MASK]about 1 @.@ 3 kilom[MASK]tres ( [MASK] @.@ 81 mi ) . 
 The Tozzer C[MASK]useway runs west from the Great[MASK]Plaza to Temple IV . 
 
 = = = Architectura[MASK] grou[MASK]s = = = 
 
 The Great P[MASK]aza lies at the core of the site ; it[MASK]is flanked on the east and west sides by two gre[MASK]t temple @-@ pyramids . On the north side it is bordered by the North Acropolis and o[MASK] [MASK]he sou[MASK]h by the Central Acropolis . 
 The Cen[MASK]ral Acropolis is a palace complex just south of the Great Plaza . 
 The North Acropoli[MASK] , together with the Great Plaza i[MASK]mediately to the south , is one [MASK]f the most studied architectural groups in the Maya area ; the[MASK]Tikal Project exca[MASK]ated a massive trench acr[MASK]ss the complex , thoroughly investigating its construction history . It is a complex group with construction beginning in the Preclassic P[MASK]riod , around 350 BC . It developed into a fune[MASK]ary complex f[MASK]r the ruling dynasty of the Classic [MASK]eriod , with each additional royal burial adding new temples on top of the older structures . After AD 400 a row of tall pyramids was added to the earlier Nort[MASK]ern Platform , which measured 100 by 80 metres ( 330 by 260 ft ) , gra[MASK]ually hiding it from view . Eight temple pyramids were [MASK]uilt in the 6th cent[MASK]ry AD , each of them had an elaborate roofcomb a[MASK]d a[MASK]stairway flanked by masks of the gods . By the 9th century AD , 43 stelae and 30 altars had been erected in [MASK]he North Acropolis[MASK]; 18 of these monume[MASK]ts were carved with hieroglyphic texts and royal portraits . The North Acropolis continued to receive burials in[MASK]o the Postclassic Period . 
 The South Acropolis[MASK]is found next to Temple [MASK]. It was built upon a large basal platform that covers an area of m[MASK]re than 20 @,@ 000 square metres ( 220 @,@ 000 sq ft [MASK] . 
 The Plaza of the Seven Temples is to the west of the Sout[MASK] Acropolis . It is bordered on the[MASK]east side by a row o[MASK] nearly identical templ[MASK]s , by[MASK]palaces [MASK]n t[MASK]e south and wes[MASK] sides and by an unusual triple ballcourt on the north side . 
 The Mundo Perdido is to the we[MASK]t of the Plaza of the Seven Temples . It is the largest ceremonial complex dating from the Preclassic period at Tikal . The compl[MASK]x wa[MASK] organized as a large E @[MASK]@ Group consisting of a pyramid aligned with a platform to the east that suppor[MASK]ed three temples . The Mundo Perdido[MASK]complex was rebuilt many tim[MASK]s over the course of its histor[MASK] . By AD 250 – 300 its architectural style was influenced by the great me[MASK]ro[MASK]o[MASK]is of[MASK]Teotihuacan in the Valley of Mexico [MASK] including the use of the talud @-@ tablero form . During the Early Classic period ( c . 250 – 600 ) the Mundo Perdido became one of the twin foci of the[MASK]city , the other being the North Acropolis . From AD 250 to 378 it may have served as the royal necropolis . The Mundo Perdido complex was given its name by the archaeologists of the University of Pennsylvania ; it is centered upon the Lost World Pyramid and a small platform to the west of it . 
 Group G lies just south of the Mendez Causeway . The complex dates [MASK]o the Late[MASK]Classic and consists of pa[MASK]ace @[MASK]@ type structures and is[MASK]one of the largest gr[MASK]ups of its type at Tikal . It has two stories but most of the rooms are on the lower floor , a to[MASK]al of 29 vaulted chambe[MASK]s . The remains of two further[MASK]chambers belong t[MASK] the upper storey . One of the entrances to the group wa[MASK] f[MASK]amed by a gigantic mask . 
 Group H is centered on a large plaza to the north of the Great Plaza . It is bordered by[MASK]temples dating to the Late Classic . 
 There are nine Twin @-@ Pyramid Complexes at Tikal , one of which was c[MASK]mpletely dism[MASK]ntled in ancient times and some othe[MASK]s were partly destroyed . They vary in size but consist of two pyramids facing each other on an east – west axis . These pyr[MASK]mids are flat @-@ toppe[MASK] [MASK]nd have st[MASK]irways on all four sides . A [MASK]ow of plain stelae is placed immediately to the west of the eastern pyramid and to the north of the pyramid[MASK] , and lying roughly equidistant from them , the[MASK]e is[MASK]usually a sculpted stela and altar pair . On the south side of these complexes there is a lo[MASK]g vaulted building containing a single room with nine doorways . The entire complex [MASK]as built a[MASK] once and these complexes were built at 20 [MASK]-@ year ( or k 'a[MASK]un ) intervals during the [MASK]ate Classic . The f[MASK]rst twin pyrami[MASK] complex was built in the[MASK]early 6th century in the East Plaza . It was once thought that these complexes were unique to Tikal but[MASK]rare examples have now been found at other sites , such as Ya[MASK]ha and Ixlu[MASK], an[MASK] they may reflect the ex[MASK]ent of Tikal [MASK]s political domin[MASK]nce in the Late Classic . 
 Group Q is a twin @-@ pyramid c[MASK]mplex , and i[MASK] one of the largest[MASK]at Tikal . It was[MASK]built by Yax Nuun Ayiin II in 771 in order to mark the [MASK]nd of th[MASK] 17th K 'atun . Most of it has[MASK]been restored and its monuments have been re @-@ erected . 
 Group R [MASK]s another twin @-@ pyramid complex ,[MASK]dated to 790 . It is close to the Maler Causeway .

 There are thousands of ancient structures at Tikal and only a fra[MASK]tion of these have been excavated , after dec[MASK]des of archaeological work [MASK] The most prominent survivin[MASK] buildings include six very large pyramids , labelled Temples I - VI , each of which support a temple structure on their summit[MASK] . Some of these pyr[MASK]mids are over 60 metre[MASK] ( 200 feet ) high . They were numbered sequentially during the early survey [MASK]f the site[MASK]. It is estimated that each of these major t[MASK]mples [MASK]ould have been b[MASK]ilt in as little as two years . 
 Temple I ( also known as the Tem[MASK]le of Ah Cacao or T[MASK]mp[MASK]e of the Great Jaguar ) is a funerary pyramid dedicated to Jasaw Chan K 'awil , who was entombed in the structure in AD 734 , the pyramid was comp[MASK]eted around 740 – 750 . The temple rises 47 metres ( 154 ft [MASK] high . The massive roofcomb that topped t[MASK]e temple[MASK]was originally decorated with a giant sculpture of the enthroned king , although little of this[MASK]decoration[MASK]survives . The tomb of the king was discovered by Aubrey Trik of the University of Pe[MASK]nsylvania in 1962 . Among items recovered from the Late Class[MASK]c tomb were a large collection of inscribed human an[MASK] [MASK]nima[MASK] bone tubes and strips wi[MASK]h sophisticated scenes depi[MASK]ting deities and p[MASK]ople [MASK][MASK]finely ca[MASK]ved and rubbed with v[MASK]rmilion , as well as jade and shell ornaments and ceramic[MASK]vesse[MASK]s f[MASK]lled with offerings of food and drink . The shrin[MASK] at the summit of the pyramid has three chambers , each behind the next , with the doorways spanned by woo[MASK]en lintels fashioned[MASK]from multiple beams . The outermost lintel is plain but t[MASK]e two inner li[MASK]tels were carved , some[MASK]of the beams were removed in the 19[MASK]h century and their location is unknown , while others were [MASK]aken to museums in Europe . 
 Temple II ([MASK]also known as the Templ[MASK] of the M[MASK]sk ) it was built ar[MASK]und AD 700 and stands[MASK]38 metres ( 125 ft ) high . Like other major [MASK]emples at Tikal , the summit shrine had three consecutive chambers with the doorways spanned by wooden lintels , only [MASK]he middle of which w[MASK]s carv[MASK]d . The temple was dedicated to the wife of Jasaw Chan K 'awil , although no tomb was found[MASK]. The queen 's portrait was ca[MASK]ved into the lintel spanning the doorway of the summit shrine . One of the beams from this lintel[MASK]is now in the American Museum of Natural History in[MASK]New York . 
 Temple III ( also[MASK]known as the Temple of the Jaguar Priest ) was the last of the great pyramids to be built[MASK]a[MASK] Tikal . It stood 55 metres ( [MASK]80 ft ) tall and contained an elaborately sculpted but damaged roof lintel , possibly showing Dark Sun engaged in a ritual dance around AD 810[MASK]. The[MASK]temple shrine possesses two chambers [MASK] 
 Temple IV is the talle[MASK]t temple @-@ pyramid at Tikal , m[MASK]asuring 70 met[MASK]es ( 230 ft ) from the plaza floor level to the top of its roof comb . Temple IV marks t[MASK]e reign of Yik ’ in Chan Kawil ( Ruler B , the son of[MASK]Ruler A or Jasaw Chan K 'awiil I ) and t[MASK]o carved wooden lintels ov[MASK]r the doo[MASK]way that leads into the temple on the pyramid ’ s summit record a long count date ( 9 @.@ 15 @.@ 10 @.@ 0 @.@ 0 ) that corresponds to CE 741 ( Sharer 1994 :[MASK]169 )[MASK]. Temple IV is the largest pyramid built anywhere in the Maya re[MASK]ion[MASK]in the 8th[MASK]centur[MASK] , and as it currently s[MASK]ands is the tallest pre @-@ Columbian structure in the Americas although the Pyramid of the Sun at Teotihuacan may [MASK]riginally have been taller[MASK], as may have been one of [MASK]he structures at El Mirador . 
 Temple V stands south of the Central Acropo[MASK]is and is the mortuary pyrami[MASK] of an as yet unidentified ruler . The temple[MASK]stands 57 metres ( 187 ft ) high , making it the second tallest structure [MASK]t Tikal - only Temple IV is taller .[MASK]T[MASK]e temple has been dat[MASK]d to about AD 700 , in the Late Classic period , via radiocarbon analysis and the dating of ceramics associated with the structure places its construction during[MASK]the reign of Nun Bak Chak in the second half of the 7th century . 
 Temple VI is also known as the Temple of the Inscriptions and was dedicated in AD 766 . It is notable for its 12 @-@ metre ( 39 ft ) high roof @-@ comb . Panels of hieroglyphs cover the b[MASK]ck and sides of the roof @-@ comb . The temple faces onto a plaz[MASK] to the west and its front is un[MASK]estored . [MASK] Temple 33 was a funerary pyramid erected over the tomb of Si[MASK]aj Chan K 'awiil I ( [MASK]nown as Burial 48 ) in the North Acropolis . It started life in the Early Classic as a wide basal pla[MASK]form decorated with large stucco masks that flanked the stairway . Later in the Early Classic a new superstructure was added , with its own masks and decorated panels . D[MASK]ring the Hiatus a[MASK]third stage was built over the earlier constructions , the[MASK]stairway was demolished and another royal burial , of an unidentified ruler , was set into the struc[MASK]ure ( Burial 23 ) . While the new pyramid was being built another high ranking[MASK]tomb ( Burial 24 ) was inserted int[MASK] the rubble core of the building . The[MASK]pyramid was then completed , standing 33 metres ( 10[MASK] ft ) [MASK]all . The [MASK]inal[MASK]version of Temple 33 was completely dismantled by archaeologists in 1965 in order to arrive at the earlier stages of construction . 
 Str[MASK]cture 34 is a pyramid in the North Acropolis that was built by Siyaj Chan K 'awiil II over the tomb of his father , Yax Nuun Ayiin I. The pyramid wa[MASK] topped by a three cha[MASK]bered shrine , t[MASK]e rooms situated one behind the oth[MASK]r . [MASK] Structure 5D @-@ 43 is an unusual radial temple in the East Plaza , built over a pre @-@ existing twin pyramid [MASK]omplex[MASK]. It i[MASK] built into the end of the East Plaza Ballcourt and possessed four entry doorways and three stairways , the fourth ( south ) side was too close to the Central Acropolis for a stairway on that side . The building has a talud @-@ ta[MASK]lero platform profile , modified from the original style found at Teotihuacan . In fact , it has been suggested that the style of the [MASK][MASK]ilding has closer affinities with El Tajin and Xochicalco than with Te[MASK]tihuacan itself . The ve[MASK]tical tablero panels[MASK]are set between sloping talud panels and are decorated with paired disc symbols . Large flower symbols are set into the sloping talud panels , related to the Venus and star symbols used at Teot[MASK]huacan . The roof of the structure was [MASK]ecorated with friezes although only[MASK]fragments now rem[MASK]in , showing a[MASK]monstrou[MASK] face , perhaps that[MASK]of a jaguar , with another head emerging from the mouth . The second head possesses a bifurcated tongue but is probably not that of a snake . The temple , and its associat[MASK]d ballcourt , probably date to [MASK]he reign of Nuun Ujol Chaak or that of his son Jasa[MASK] Chan K 'awiil I , in the later part of the 7th century[MASK]. 
 Structure 5C @-@ 49 possesses a clear Teotihuacan @-@ linked arch[MASK]tectural st[MASK]le ; it has balustrades , an architectural featur[MASK] that is very rare in the Maya region , and a talud @-@ tablero façade ; it date[MASK] to the 4t[MASK] century AD . It is locate[MASK] near to the Lost World pyramid . 
 Structure 5C @-@ 53 [MASK]s a small[MASK]Teotihuacan @-@ style platform that dat[MASK]s to about AD 600 . It had stairways on all fou[MASK] sides and did not possess a superstructure . 
 The Lost World Pyramid ( Structure 5C @-@ 54 ) is the largest structure in the Mundo Perdido complex . It lies in the southw[MASK]st portion of Tikal ’ s central core , south of Temple III and west of[MASK]Temple V. It was decorated with stucco masks of the sun god and dates to the Late Preclassic ; this pyramid is part of an enclosed complex of structures that remained intact and un [MASK]-@ [MASK]mpacted by later building activity at Tikal . By the end of the Late Preclassic this pyramid was one of the largest structures in the Maya region . It attained its final form during the reign of Chak Tok Ich 'aak[MASK]in the 4th century AD , in the Early Classic , standing more th[MASK]n 30 metres ( 98 ft )[MASK]high with stairw[MASK]ys on all four sides and a flat top that possibly supported a superstructure built from peris[MASK]able materials . Although the plaza later suffered significant alterati[MASK]n , the organization of a group of temples on t[MASK]e east side of this complex ad[MASK]e[MASK]es to the l[MASK]yout that defines the so @-@ called E @-@ Groups , identified as solar observatories . 
 Stru[MASK]ture 5D @-@ 96 is the central temple on the east side [MASK]f the Plaza of the Seven[MASK]Temples [MASK] It has been restored and its rear outer wall is decorated [MASK]ith sk[MASK]ll @-@ and @-@ crossbones motifs . 
 Gro[MASK]p[MASK]6C @-@ 16 is an eli[MASK]e residential complex that has been[MASK]thoroughly e[MASK]cavated . It lies a few hundred[MASK]metres [MASK]outh of the Lost World Complex and the excavations have revealed elab[MASK]rate stucco masks , ballplayer murals , relief sculptures and building[MASK] wi[MASK]h Teo[MASK]ihuacan[MASK]characteristics . 
 The Great Plaza Ballcourt is [MASK] small ballcourt that lies between Te[MASK]ple I and the Central Acropolis . 
 The [MASK]at Palace is also known as the Palace of Windows and lies to the west of Temple III . It has two stor[MASK]ys , with a double range[MASK]of chambers on the lower store[MASK] [MASK]nd a si[MASK]gle range in the uppe[MASK] storey , which has been rest[MASK]red . The palace has ancien[MASK] graffiti and possesses low windows . 
 Complex N lies to the west of the Ba[MASK] Palace and Temple III . The complex da[MASK]es t[MASK] AD 711 . 
 
 = = = Altars = = = 
 
 Altar 5 is carved with two nobles , one of whom is probably Jasaw[MASK]Chan K 'awi[MASK]l I. They are performing a ritual using the bones of an important woman . Altar 5 was found in[MASK]Complex N , which lies to the west of Temple III . 
 Altar [MASK] is sculpted with a bound captive . It was found within Complex P in Group H and is now in the Museo Nacional de Arqueología y Etnología in Guatemala City . 
 Altar 9 is as[MASK]ociated with Stela 21 and bears the sculpture of a bound captive . It is located in fro[MASK]t of Temple VI . 
 Altar 10 is car[MASK][MASK]d with a captive tied to a scaffold . [MASK]t is in the northern enclosure of Group Q[MASK], [MASK] twin @-@ pyramid complex and has suffered from erosion . 
 Altar 35 is a [MASK]lain monument associated with Stela 43 . The stela @-@ altar [MASK]air is centrally located [MASK]t the base of the stairway of Temple IV . [MASK] 
 = = = Lintels = = = 
 
 At Tikal , beams of sapodilla wood were placed as lintels spanning the inner doorways of temples . These are the most elaborately carved wooden[MASK]lintels to[MASK]ha[MASK]e survived anywhere in the Maya regi[MASK]n[MASK]. 
 L[MASK]ntel 3 from Temple IV was taken to Basel in Switzerland in the 19th century . It was in almost perfect condition and depicts Yik 'i[MASK] Chan K 'awiil seated on a palanquin . 
 
 = = = Stelae = = = 
 
 Stelae are carved stone shafts , often sculpted with figures and hieroglyphs . A select[MASK]on of the[MASK]mo[MASK]t notable stelae at Tikal follows [MASK] 
 Stela 1 dates to the 5th century and depicts the king Siyaj Chan K 'awiil II in a standing position .[MASK]
 Stela 4 is dated to AD 396 , during the reign of Yax Nuun Ayiin[MASK]after the intrusion of Teotihuacan in the Maya area . The stela disp[MASK]ays a mix of Maya and Teot[MASK]huacan qualities , and deities from both cultures [MASK] It has a portrait of the king w[MASK]th the Underworld Jaguar God under one arm and the Mexic[MASK]n Tlaloc under the othe[MASK] . His helmet is a simplified version of the Teot[MASK]huacan War Serpent . Unusually for Maya sculpture , but typically for Teotihuacan , Yax Nuun Ayiin is depicted[MASK]with a frontal face , rather than in profile . 
 Stela 5 was dedicated in 744 by Yik 'in Chan K 'awiil . 
 Stela 6 is a badly [MASK]amaged monument dating to 514 and bears the name of [MASK]he " Lady of Tikal " who celebrated the end of the 4th K 'atun in that year [MASK] 
 Stela 10 is twinned with Stela 12 but is badly damaged . It described the accession of Kaloomte ' B 'alam in the early 6th century and earlier events in his career , including the capture of a pr[MASK]soner depicted on the monument . 
 Stela 1[MASK] was the last monument ever [MASK]rected at Tikal ; it was dedicated in 869 by Ja[MASK]aw [MASK]han K 'awi[MASK]l II . 
 Stela 1[MASK] is linked to the queen [MASK]nown as the " Lady of Tikal " and king Kaloomte ' B 'alam . [MASK]he queen is described as performing the year @-@ ending rituals but[MASK]the m[MASK]nument w[MASK]s dedicated in honor of the king . 
 Stela 16 was dedicated in 711 , during the reign of Jasaw Chan K 'awiil I. The sculpture , including a portrait of the [MASK]ing and a hieroglyphic text , are limited to the front face [MASK]f the monument . It was found in Complex N , west of Temple III . 
 Stela 18 was one of two stelae erec[MASK]ed by Yax Nu[MASK]n [MASK]yiin I to celebrate the [MASK] 'atun @-@ end[MASK]ng of AD 396 . It wa[MASK] re @-@ erected at the base of Temple 34 , his funerary shrine [MASK] 
 Stela 19 was dedicated in 790 by [MASK]ax Nuun Ayii[MASK] II . 
 Stela 20 was found in C[MASK]mplex P , in Group H , and was moved to th[MASK] Museo Nacional de[MASK]Arqueología y Etnología in Guatemala Ci[MASK]y . 
 Stela 21 was dedicated in 736 by Yik 'in Chan K 'awiil . Only the bottom of the stela is intact , the rest having b[MASK]en mutilated in ancient times . The survi[MASK]ing sculpture i[MASK] of fine quality , consisting of the feet of a figure and of accompanying hieroglyphic text . The stela is associated with Altar 9 and is locat[MASK]d in fron[MASK] of Temple[MASK]VI . 
 Stela 22 was dedicated i[MASK] 771 by Ya[MASK][MASK]Nuun Ayiin II in the northern enclosure of Grou[MASK] Q , a twin @-@ pyramid complex . The face of the figure on the stela has been mutilated [MASK] 
 Stela 23 was broken in antiquity and was re @-@ erected in a residential com[MASK]lex . The defaced portrait on the monument is that of the so @-@ called " Lady of Tikal " , a d[MASK]ughter of [MASK]hak Tok Ich 'aak[MASK]II who became queen at the age of six but never ruled in her own right , being paired with male co @-@ rulers . It dates to the ear[MASK]y 6th century . 
 Stela 24 was erected at the foot of Te[MASK]ple 3 in 810 , accompanied by Altar 7 . Both were broke[MASK] into f[MASK]agments in ancient times , althoug[MASK] the name of Dark Sun survives on three fragments . 
 Stela 26 was found in the summit shrine of Temple 34 , underneath a broken [MASK]as[MASK]n[MASK]y altar . The monument had originall[MASK] been erected at the base of the temple dur[MASK]ng the Early Classic period and was later broken , probably at the beginning of the Late Classic . Its remains were t[MASK]en interred within the temple shrine . 
 Stela 29 bears a Long Count ( 8 @.@ 12 @.@ 14 @.@ 8 @.@ 15 )[MASK]date equivalent to AD 292 , the earliest surviving Long Count date from th[MASK] Maya lowlands . The stela is also the earliest monument to bear the Tikal emblem glyph . It bears[MASK]a sculpture of the king f[MASK]cing [MASK]o the right , holding the head of an underworld jaguar god[MASK], one of the [MASK]atron deities of the city . The stela was deliberately smashed during the 6th century or som[MASK] time later , the up[MASK]er portion was dragged away and dumped in a[MASK]rubbish tip close to Temple III , to be uncovered by arch[MASK]eologist[MASK] in 1959 . 
 Stela 30 is the first surviv[MASK]ng monument to be erected after the[MASK]Hiatus . Its style and iconography is similar to that of Caracol , one of the more important of Tikal 's enemies . 
 Stela 31 is the accession monument of Siyaj Chan K 'awiil II[MASK], also bearing two portraits of his father , Yax Nuun Ayiin , as a youth dressed as a [MASK]eotih[MASK]acan warrior . He carr[MASK]es a spearthrower in one hand and bears a shield decorated with the f[MASK]ce of Tlaloc , the Teotihuacan war god . In ancient times the sculpture was br[MASK]ken and the upper portion was moved to the summit of Temple 33 and[MASK]ritually buried . Stela 31 has been de[MASK]cribed a[MASK] the greatest Early Classic sculpture to survive at Tikal [MASK] A long hieroglyphic text is carved onto the back of the monument ,[MASK]the longest to survive from the Early Classic , w[MASK]ich describes the arrival of Siyah K 'ak ' at El Peru and Tikal in January 378 . I[MASK] was also the firs[MASK] stela at Ti[MASK]al to be carved on all four faces . 
 Stela 32 [MASK]s[MASK]a fragmented monument wi[MASK]h a foreign Teotihuacan @-@ style sculpture[MASK]apparently depicting the lord of [MASK][MASK]at city with the attribut[MASK]s o[MASK] the central Mexican storm god Tlaloc , including his gog[MASK]le eyes and tasselled headdress . 
 St[MASK]la 39 is a broken monument that was erec[MASK]e[MASK] in the Lost World complex . The uppe[MASK] portion o[MASK] the stela is missing but the lower portion shows the lower body and legs of Chak Tok Ich 'aak , holding [MASK] flint axe in his left hand . He is tr[MASK]mpling the figure of a bound , richly dressed ca[MASK]tive . The monument is [MASK]ated to AD[MASK]376 . The text on the back of the monument describes[MASK]a bloodletting ritual to celebrate a Katun @-@ ending . The st[MASK]la also[MASK]names Ch[MASK]k Tok Ich 'aak I 's father as K '[MASK]nic[MASK] Muwaan Jol . 
 St[MASK]la 40 bears a portrait of Kan Chitam and dates to AD 468 . 
 Stela 43 is paired with Altar 35 . It is a plain monument at the base of[MASK]the stairway of Temple IV .

 Burial 1 is a tom[MASK] in the Lost World[MASK]complex . A fine ceramic bowl was recovered from the tomb , with the handle formed from three @-@[MASK]dimensional head and ne[MASK]k of a bird emerging from the two @-@ dimensional body painted on the lid . 
 Burial 10 is the tomb of Yax Nuun Ayiin [MASK] It is located[MASK]beneath Structure 34 in the North Acropolis . The tomb contained [MASK] rich array of offerings , including ceramic vessels and food , and nine youths were sacrificed to accompany the dead king . A dog was also entombed wi[MASK]h the deceased king . P[MASK]ts in[MASK]the tomb were stuccoed and painted and many demonstrated a blend of M[MASK]ya and T[MASK]otihuacan styles . Among the[MASK]offerings was an incens[MASK] @-@ [MASK]urner i[MASK] the[MASK]shape[MASK]of an elderly underworld god , sitting on a stool made of human bones and holding a sev[MASK]red head in his hands . The tomb was sealed with a corbel vault , then the pyramid was built on top . 
 Burial 48 is generally accepted as the tomb of Siyaj Chan K 'awil . It is locat[MASK]d beneath Temple 33 in [MASK]he North Acropolis . The chamber of the tomb was cut fro[MASK] [MASK]he bedrock and contained the remains of the king himself together with those of two adolescents who had be[MASK]n sacrificed in order to accompany the de[MASK]eas[MASK]d ruler . [MASK]he walls of the tomb were covered with white stucco painted with hierogly[MASK]h[MASK] that included the Long Count date equivalent to 20 March 457 , probably the date of either the death or inter[MASK]ent of the king . The king 's skeleton was missing [MASK]ts s[MASK]ull , its femurs and one of its hands whil[MASK] the sk[MASK]letons of the sacrificial[MASK]victims were intact . 
 Burial 85 dates to the Late Preclassic and was enclosed by a[MASK]pla[MASK]form , with a primitive corbel vault . The tomb contained a single male skeleton , which lacked a skull and its thighbones . The dynastic f[MASK]under of Tikal , Y[MASK]x Ehb ' Xook , has be[MASK]n linked to this tomb , which lies[MASK]deep in the heart of the North A[MASK]ropolis . The deceased had probably died in battle with his body being mutilated by his enemies b[MASK]fore being recovere[MASK] and interred by his followers . The bones were wrapped carefully in textiles to form an upright bu[MASK]dle . T[MASK]e missing head was [MASK]e[MASK]laced by a sma[MASK]l greens[MASK]one mask with shell @-@ inlaid teeth and eyes and bea[MASK]ing a three @-@ pointed royal headband . This head wears an emblem of r[MASK]lers[MASK]ip [MASK]n its forehead [MASK]nd is a rare Preclassic lowland Maya portrait[MASK]of a king . Among the contents of the t[MASK]mb were a stingray spine , a spondylus shell and twenty @-@ six ceramic vessels . 
 Burial 116 is the tomb of Jasaw Chan K 'awiil I. It is [MASK] large [MASK]ault[MASK]d chamber deep within the py[MASK]amid , below the leve[MASK] of the Great Plaza . The tomb contained rich offerings of jadeite , ceramics , shell and works o[MASK] art . The body of the king was covered with large quantities of jade ornaments including an enormou[MASK] n[MASK]cklace with especially large beads , as depicted in sculpted p[MASK]rtraits of the ki[MASK]g . One of the outstanding pieces recovered from the tomb w[MASK]s an ornate jade [MASK]osaic vessel with the lid bearing a sculpt[MASK]d portrait of the king himself . 
 Burial 195 was flooded wi[MASK]h mud in antiquity . This flood had covered wooden o[MASK]jects that had completely rotted away by the time the tomb was excavated , leaving [MASK]ollows in the dried mud . Archae[MASK]logists filled these hollows with stucco [MASK]nd thus excavated four effigies of the god K 'awiil , the wooden originals long gone [MASK] 
 Burial 19[MASK] is a Late Classic ro[MASK]al tomb th[MASK]t contained a jade mosaic vessel topped [MASK]ith the head of the Maize God . 
 
 
 = Tropical Storm Josephine ( 2008 ) = 
 
 Tropical Storm Josephine was the tenth tropical storm of the 2008 Atlantic hurricane season[MASK]. Josephine developed out of a s[MASK]rong tropical wave which moved off the African coast on August 31 . The wave quickly became organized and was declared Tropical Depression Ten while located 170 mi ( 270 km ) to the south @-@ southeast of the Cape Verde Islands on September 2 . The depre[MASK]sion was quickly upgraded to Tropical Storm Josephine around noon the same day .[MASK]Over the next several days , Josephine moved in a genera[MASK] wes[MASK] @-@ northw[MASK]st direction and reached its peak intensity early on September 3 . Strong wind s[MASK]ea[MASK] , some due to the outflow[MASK]of Hurricane Ike , and dry air caused the storm to weaken . On S[MASK]ptember 6 , t[MASK]e combination of wind shear[MASK], dry air , and [MASK]o[MASK]ling waters ca[MASK]sed Josephine to weaken into a tropical depression . Josep[MASK]ine deteriorated into a remnant low shortly after as convection continued to dissipate around th[MASK] storm . The low ultimately dissipated while located 520 mi ( 83[MASK] [MASK]m ) east of Guadeloupe on September 10 . However , the re[MASK]nant moisture led to minor flooding on the i[MASK]land of St. Croix .

 Tropical Storm Josephine formed as a tropical wave that emerged off the west coast of Africa near the end of August 2008 . It tracked south of Cape Verde and slowly developed , and on September 2 the disturbance became[MASK]Tropical Depression Ten while located south @-@ southeast of the Cape[MASK]Verde islands . As the depression became more organized[MASK], an eye @-@ like fe[MASK]ture developed in the upper levels [MASK]f the system[MASK]. The depres[MASK]ion [MASK]as upgraded[MASK]to Trop[MASK]cal Storm Jo[MASK]ephine six hours after forming . Josephine was located in an area which was supportive for rapid intensification but was n[MASK]t forecast to intensify quickly . [MASK] Josephine continued to intensify throughout the [MASK]fternoon as the storm became more [MASK]ymmetrical . However , due to the location of the storm , there was a lack of accurate wind spee[MASK] readings , and the National Hurricane Center was uncertain of its actual intensity . Despite the lack of wind shear around the storm , the center became s[MASK]ightly exposed and ceased further intensification . The storm w[MASK]s also heading into an area where shear was forecasted [MASK]o significantly i[MASK]crease due to an upper @-@ level troug[MASK] diving southward . Despite convection being partially [MASK]emoved from the ce[MASK]ter of Josephine , the storm intensified slightly in the early morning hours on September 3 as thunderstorm acti[MASK]ity to the so[MASK]th of the center became more org[MASK]nized . The intensification was forecast to be sh[MASK]rt in[MASK]duration as the trough to the north was deepening ,[MASK]causing the wind shear to the west to become [MASK]tronger . 
 Josephine [MASK]eached its peak intensity of[MASK]65 mph[MASK]( 100 km / h ) around 8 a.m. ( EDT ) as it continued to[MASK]become more organized . However , there were indi[MASK]ations that it had[MASK]already [MASK]egun to weaken . Outflow towards the north was becoming restrict[MASK]d and arc clouds began emanating from the storm , a sign [MASK]hat dry air was entering the syst[MASK]m . During the afternoon hours , the structure of Josephine began to rapidly deteriorate as strong wind[MASK]shear and dry air took their toll . By the late n[MASK]ght , the center [MASK]as almost completely exposed and only a band of co[MASK]vection persisted near the center . 
 Despite continuing[MASK]effects from the strong wind shear , a large , deep burst of[MASK]convection [MASK]ormed in the northern semicircle of Josephine . The center was fou[MASK]d to have shifted towards the new convection leading to an increase in intensity . The forecast showed a slight decrease in win[MASK] shear as Josephine contin[MASK]ed westward and no change in intensity over the 5 [MASK]-@ day forecast was [MASK]red[MASK]cted . However , the convection decreased once more and the low became completely exposed by the late morning[MASK]hours and Josephine weakened again . By the afternoon , the center of Jos[MASK]phine was only a swirl of[MASK]clouds , devoi[MASK] of convection . During the overnight hours on September 4 into the morning of September 5 , conve[MASK]tion associated with J[MASK]sephine began to redevelop somewhat , mostly to the north of[MASK]the circulation , due to the strong southerly wi[MASK]d shear . By mid @-@ morning , Josephine re @-@ intensifie[MASK] slightly due to the redevelopment of some conv[MASK]ction . However [MASK] t[MASK][MASK] redevelopment was short lived and[MASK]win[MASK] shear again[MASK]t[MASK]ok its to[MASK]l on [MASK]os[MASK]phine by late morning[MASK]. The convection around the system became dislocat[MASK]d from the center[MASK]and Josephine weakened slightly . 
 The weakening trend continued th[MASK]ough the afternoon as th[MASK] storm was being affected by strong southerly shear . Josephine became almost fully devoid of any conv[MASK]c[MASK]ion by mid @-@ afternoon and the storm weakened to 40 mph ( 65 km / h[MASK]) , barely holding on to tropical storm status [MASK] Josephine regained a small amount of convection in the late night hours [MASK] but not enough to still be classified a tropical storm . Due to the lack of convection , Josephine was downgraded to a Tropical Depression at 11p.m. ( EDT ) with winds of 35 mph ( 55 km / h ) . Since there [MASK]as no convec[MASK]ion around the system , it [MASK]ould have normally been classified a remnant low but , due to the possibility of the storm regenerating over the next several days , it was co[MASK]sidered a tropical depression . The next morning , J[MASK]sephine was downgraded to a remnant[MASK]low as strong wind s[MASK]ear and dry air caused the demise of the storm . No redevelopment was expected with Josephine as it began to move over colder waters a[MASK]d rem[MASK]in under strong wind shear until it dissipated .

 As Josephine passed to the south of the Cape Verde islands on September 2 , outer rain bands produced minor rainfall , totalin[MASK] around 0 @.@ 5[MASK] inches ( 14 mm ) . There were no reports of damage or flooding from the rain and overall effects were minor . 
 Several[MASK]days after the low dissipated , the remnant moistur[MASK] from Jos[MASK]phine brought showers and thunderstorms to St. Croix where up to 1 in ( 25 @.@ 4 mm [MASK] of rai[MASK] fell .

 Mount Elbert is the highest summit of the Rocky Moun[MASK]ains o[MASK] North America and the hi[MASK]hest point in the U.S.[MASK]state of Colorado a[MASK]d [MASK]he [MASK]ntire Mississipp[MASK] River drainage b[MASK]sin . The ult[MASK]a @-@ [MASK]rominent 14 @,@ 440 @-@ fo[MASK]t ( 4401 @.@ 2 m ) fourteener is [MASK]he highest peak in the Sawatch Range a[MASK]d the se[MASK]ond @-@ highest summit in the contiguous United States after Mount Whitney . Mount Elbert is l[MASK]cated in S[MASK]n Isabel National Forest , 12 @.@ 1 miles ( 19 @.@ 4 km ) southwest ( bearing 22[MASK] ° ) of the City of Le[MASK]dville in Lake County , Colorado . 
 The mountain was named in honor[MASK]of Colorado statesman Samuel Hitt Elbert , who was active in the formative period of the state and Governor of the Territory of Colorado from 1873 to 1874 . Henry W. Stuckle of the Hayden Survey was the first to record an ascent of the peak , in 1874 . The ea[MASK]iest and most popular climbing routes are categorized as Class 1 to 2 or A + in mountaineeri[MASK]g parlance . [MASK]ount Elbert is therefore often referred to as the " gentle giant " that tops al[MASK] others in the Rocky Mountains .

 M[MASK]unt Elbert is visible to the southwest of Leadville , often snow [MASK]-@ capped even in the summer . Many other fourteeners surround Elbert in all directions , an[MASK] it is very close to central Colorado 's Collegiate Peaks . The neighboring Mount M[MASK][MASK]sive , to the north , is the second @-@ highest peak in the Rocky Mountains and the third @-@ highest in the contiguous United States , and La Plata [MASK]eak , t[MASK] the south , is the fifth @-@ highest in the Rockies . The community of Twin Lakes lies at the base of Mount El[MASK]ert , Denver is about 130 miles[MASK]( 20[MASK] km ) to the east , Vail is 50 miles ( 80 km ) to the no[MASK]th , and Aspen is 40 miles ( 64 km ) to the west . Lead[MASK]ille , about 16 miles ( 26 km ) to the northeast , is the nearest large town . Elber[MASK] 's parent peak i[MASK] Mount Whitney in California . Including Alaska and Hawaii , Mou[MASK]t Elbert is the fourteenth @-@ highest mountain in the [MASK]nited States . 
 Weather conditions often change[MASK]rapidly , and afternoon thunderstorms are com[MASK]on in the summertime ; hailstorms and snow are possible year @-@ round . An electrical storm on the mountain 's summit was considered remarkable enough to be reported in the July 1894 issue of Scienc[MASK] . 
 
 = = Geology = = 
 
 Mount Elb[MASK]rt is part of the Sawatch Range [MASK] an uplift of the Laramide Orogeny which separated from the Mosquito Range to the east around 28 milli[MASK]n years ago . The tops of this range were heavily glaciated , leaving[MASK]behind character[MASK]stic summit features and oth[MASK]r such clues . For example , the base of Elbe[MASK]t on the eastern side exhibits large igneous and metamorphic rocks deposited whe[MASK] t[MASK]e glaciers receded , which lie on a lateral moraine . Further up the eastern side there[MASK]is a large cirque with a small tarn . There are also l[MASK]kes to both the north and south , Turq[MASK]oise and Twin Lakes respectively ; the Twin Lakes are a result of the natural dam of end moraines , and Turquoise La[MASK]e was created by the manmade Sugar Loaf Dam . 
 Mount Elbert is composed la[MASK]gely of quartzite . However , the summit ridge consists of metamorphic ba[MASK]ement rock , which is Pre @-@ Camb[MASK]ian in origin and abo[MASK]t 1 @.@ 7 billion years old . There are various ign[MASK]ous intrusions including pegmatite , as well as " bands " of gneiss and schist . Unlike [MASK]ountains of similar altitude elsewhere , Elbert lacks both a [MASK]ermanent snowpack and a prominent north @-@ facing cirque , which can be attributed to its position amongst other mountains of similar height , causing i[MASK][MASK]to receive relatively small quantities of precipitat[MASK]on [MASK] 
 
 = = History = = 
 
 Mount Elbert was nam[MASK]d by min[MASK]rs in honor [MASK]f Samue[MASK] Hitt Elbert , the governo[MASK] of the then @-@ Territory of Colorado , because he brokered a treaty in September 1873 with the Ute tribe tha[MASK] opened up more than[MASK]3 @,@ 000 @,@ 000 acres ( 12 @,@ 000 km2 ) of reservation land to mining and railroad activity . The first recorded ascent of the peak was[MASK]by H.W.[MASK]Stuckle in 1874 , who was surveying the mountain as part of the Hayden Survey . 
 Originally measured as 1[MASK] @,@ 433 feet ( 4 @,@ 399 m ) in height , Mount Elbert 's ele[MASK]ation was later adjusted to 14 @,@ 440 feet ( 4 @,@ 4[MASK]0 m ) following a re @-@ evaluation of m[MASK]pped elevations , whic[MASK] sparked protests . The actual change was made in 1988 as a result of the North American[MASK]Vertical Datum of 1988 ; it seems the original measurement resulted from the Sea Level Datum of[MASK]1929 . A matter of some contention arose after the [MASK]reat Depression over the heights of Elbert [MASK]nd its neighbor , Mount Massive , which differ i[MASK] elevation by only 12 feet ( 3 @.@ 7 m ) . This led to an ongoing dispute that came to a head with the Mount Massive supporte[MASK]s building large piles[MASK]of stones [MASK]n the summit to boost its height , only to ha[MASK]e the Mount [MASK]lbert proponents demolish [MASK]hem . The effort was ultimately un[MASK]uccess[MASK]ul and Mount Elbert has remained the highest peak in Colorado . The f[MASK]rst motorized ascent of Elbert occurre[MASK] in 1949 , when a Jeep was driven t[MASK] the summit , apparently to judge suitability for skiing development .

 The summit of Mount Elber[MASK] is an alpine environment , featuring plants such as Phaceli[MASK] sericea ( sky @-@ pilot ) , Hymenoxys grandiflora ( old @-@ man @-@ of [MASK]-@ the @-@ mountain ) , and Geum rossii[MASK]( alpine avens ) . Also noted are Car[MASK]x atrata var. pullata [MASK] Salix des[MASK]rtorum , Platanthera hyperborea , Thalictrum fendleri , Aquilegia canadensis , Chenopodium album , Gentiana detonsa var. hallii , and Bigelovia pa[MASK]ryi . Below tre[MASK]line the mountain is heavily forested , w[MASK]th the lower slopes covered with a mixture of lodgepole pine , spruce ,[MASK]aspen and fir . 
 Some of the fauna reported on the climb to the[MASK]summit include black[MASK]bears , marmots , mule deer , pikas , and pocket goph[MASK]rs[MASK]; there are also many species of avifauna . Elk , grouse , turkey and bi[MASK]horn sheep are present in[MASK]the area during the summer .

 There are thr[MASK]e main routes which ascend the mountain , all of wh[MASK]ch gain over 4 @,@ 100 feet ( 1 @,@ 200 m ) of elevation .

 The Church of Scientology has been present in Germany since 1970 . Germ[MASK]n authorit[MASK]es esti[MASK]ate that there are 4 @,@ 000 active Scie[MASK]tologists in Germany today[MASK]; the Church of Scientology gives a membership figure of around 12 [MASK],@ 000 . The Church of Scientology [MASK]as encountered particular antagonism fro[MASK] the German press and government and occupies a precarious legal , social and cultural position in Germany . 
 German courts have so far not resolved whether Scientology should be accorded [MASK][MASK]e legal status of a religious or worldview community , and different courts ha[MASK]e reached contradictory conclusions . The German domestic intelligence service has monitored the organization 's activities . The German gov[MASK]rnment does not recognize Scientology as a religio[MASK] . It views it as an abusive b[MASK]siness[MASK]masquerading as a religion and believes that i[MASK] pursues political goals that conflict with[MASK]the values enshrined in the German constitu[MASK]ion . This stance has been criticized , most n[MASK]tably by the U.S. government , which recognizes Scientology as a religion and has raised [MASK]oncerns abo[MASK]t the violation of individual rights posed by sect [MASK]ilters . 
 Scientologists in Germany f[MASK]ce specific political and economic res[MASK]rictions . They are barred [MASK][MASK]om[MASK]members[MASK]ip in some major political parties , and business[MASK]s and other employers use so @-[MASK] called " sect fi[MASK]ters " to expose a prospective business partner 's or employee 's association with the organization . German f[MASK][MASK]eral and state in[MASK]erior ministers started [MASK] process aimed at banning Scientology in late 2007 , but abandoned the[MASK]initiative a year later , finding insufficient[MASK]legal grounds . Despite this , pol[MASK]s suggest that most Germans favor banning Scientology[MASK]altogether . 
 
 = = Background = = 
 
 Scientology , founded in the early 1950s in the United States by [MASK]. Ron Hubbard and today cla[MASK]ming to be represented in 150 countrie[MASK] , has been a very controvers[MASK]al new religious movement . Its stated[MASK]utopian aim is to " clear [MASK]he p[MASK]anet " , to bring about an enlightened age in which every[MASK]individual has overcome their psychologic[MASK]l limitations . Scientology teaches that[MASK]the source of people 's unhappiness[MASK]lies in " engrams " , psychological burdens acquired in the course of painful experiences , wh[MASK]ch can be clear[MASK]d through a type of counselling called " auditing " made [MASK]vailable by the Church of Scientology[MASK]. 
 The fact that Scientologists have to pay large fees for auditing and other Scientology services has brought controversy to Scientology throughout much of its history , with governments classing it as a profit @-@ making enterprise rather than as a religion . Critics maintain that Scientology[MASK]is " a business @-@ drive[MASK] , psychologically manipulative , total[MASK]tarian ideol[MASK]gy with world @-@ dominating aspirations " , and that it tricks its members into parting with significant sums of [MASK]oney for Scientology courses . Scient[MASK]logy has fought innumerable lawsuits to defend itself against such charges and to pursue legal recognition as a r[MASK]ligion . These efforts have been partly su[MASK]cessful [MASK] S[MASK]ientology has gained recognition as a tax @-@ exempt religious group in a number of countries , most no[MASK]ably in Australia in 1983 and the United States in 1993 , and [MASK]n 2007 won an important case [MASK]t the European Court of Human Rights , which censured Russia for failing to register Scientology as a r[MASK]ligion . 
 The Germ[MASK]n government has said that it doe[MASK] not consider Scientology a r[MASK]ligio[MASK] , but a " commercial enterprise with a history of taking advantage of vulnerable individuals and an extreme dislike of any criticism " whose " totalitarian structure and methods may pose a risk[MASK]to Germany 's democratic so[MASK]iety " . Acco[MASK]dingly , the German government has taken a very strong stance against the [MASK]rganization . Germany is[MASK]not alone in opposing Sc[MASK]entology ; in France , the Church of Scientology was convicted of organized fraud in October 2009 [MASK] after a court[MASK]found that members ha[MASK] been manipulated into paying large [MASK]ums for Scientology products , and the Church only narrowly escaped being banned altogether . Scientology is similarly controversial in Belgium , Greece and the UK . 
 On the subject of Scientology 's status as a religion , the German government has pointed to a 1995 decis[MASK]on by the Federal Labor Court of Germany . That [MASK]ourt , noting Hubbard 's[MASK]instruction that Scientologists should[MASK]"[MASK]make money , make more money – [MASK]ake other people produce [MASK]o as to make more money " , came to the conclusion that " Scientology purports to be a ' church ' merely as a cover to pursue its economic interests " . In the same decision , the court also found that Scientology uses " inhuman and totalitarian practices " . Given the lessons of Germany '[MASK] 20th @-@ century [MASK]istory , in which the country ca[MASK]e to be dominated by a fascist movement that started from similarly small be[MASK]innings , Germany is very wary of any ideologica[MASK] [MASK]ovement that mi[MASK]ht appear to be seeking a p[MASK]sition of absolute power . Referenc[MASK]s in S[MASK]ientology[MASK]writings to the elimination of " parasites " and " antisocial " people who stand in[MASK]the way of progress towards Scientol[MASK]gy [MASK]s utopian world " without insanity[MASK], without[MASK]criminals and without war " evoke uncomfortable parallels with Nazism , and have led to Scientology being c[MASK]assified as an " extremist political movement " . 
 To fur[MASK]her justify its stance , the German government[MASK]has also pointed to the long his[MASK]ory of U.S. court cases involving Scientology , includ[MASK]ng the [MASK]onviction of 11 top Scientologis[MASK]s in 1979 and 1980 for a conspirac[MASK] involving the infiltration of U.S. government agencies , wiretapping and the theft of government documents[MASK], a[MASK]1994 U.S. Supreme Court finding that Scientology practices t[MASK]ok place in a " coercive environment " , and Scientology[MASK]'s track record of pursuing its critics through malicious court cases and private investigators . In e[MASK]amining the potential threat posed by Scientology the German gove[MASK]nment has note[MASK] that Scientology orga[MASK]izations a[MASK]e " structured so as to make the individual psychologica[MASK]ly and financially dependent on a Scientology system " , [MASK]nd that members often abandon contact w[MASK]th friends and f[MASK]mily .

 Sci[MASK]ntology first became active in Germany in 1970 . By 2007 , there were ten major cen[MASK]res ( " Scientology Churches " ) , as well as fourteen minor centres ( " Scientology Missions " ) in Germa[MASK]y . The German Sciento[MASK]ogy Ch[MASK]rc[MASK]es are located in the big cities – Munich , Hamburg , Berlin , Düsseldorf , [MASK]rankfurt am Main , Hanover and Stuttgart . Of the Scientology Missions , nine are in Baden @-@ Württemberg , and[MASK]thr[MASK]e in Bavaria . Following German re @-@ unification , Sci[MASK]ntology proved unable to gain significant numbers of followers in the territories of the former German Democratic Republic ; most adherents are found in Baden @-@ Württemberg , Bavaria and [MASK]orth @-@ Rhine Westphalia . [MASK] Scien[MASK]ology is represented by a large number of independ[MASK]nt associations or Vereine in Germany ; their umbrella organisation is the Scientology Kirche Deutschland e.V. Germany 's domestic intelligence service , the Bunde[MASK]amt für Verfassungsschutz ( BfV , or Federal [MASK]ffice[MASK]for the Protection of the Constitution ) , est[MASK]mates that there are 4 @,@ 000 Scientologists in Germany , down from earlier estimates of 5 @,@ 000 to 6 @,@ 000 .[MASK]The Church of Scientology reported around 30 @,@ 000 members from the mid @-@ 1990s onwards ; this number remained stable for many[MASK]years[MASK]. However more recently Scientology has said it has only 12 @,@ 000 members . Discrepancies in Sc[MASK]entology member[MASK]hip [MASK][MASK]mbers arise because the Church of Scientology app[MASK]ies more inclusive criteria in establishing its figures , e[MASK]sentially inc[MASK]uding anyone who has purchas[MASK]d a book or participated in courses , regardless of their subsequent involvement . The number of cont[MASK]actually bound Scient[MASK]logy staff mem[MASK][MASK]rs working in German Scientology organizations is unlikely to exceed a few hundred . 
 Scientology formulated a " Clear Germany " strategy i[MASK] 1994 – similar to equivalent strat[MASK]gies pursued by Sci[MASK]ntology in other countries and regions of the wo[MASK]ld – with the long @-@ term aim of tr[MASK]nsforming German society in line with the Scientological ideal : a non @-@ pluralist society [MASK]n w[MASK]ich Scientology enjoys overriding influence . The programm[MASK] sought to address Scientology 's image problems in Germany ,[MASK]to[MASK]identify weak points in Germany that could be exploited f[MASK]r political gain , su[MASK]h as Germany 's National Socialist history , and to increase both membership figures and political influence in German society , with a speci[MASK]l emphasis on manoeuvring Scient[MASK]lo[MASK]ists into key positions in industry and government . As most religions seek [MASK]o widen th[MASK]ir infl[MASK]ence in society , such a programme could of course also be defended as a[MASK]missionary effort , much like those many religions engage in . Howeve[MASK] , according to the BfV , the strategy has not had[MASK]any significan[MASK] success . By 1998 , [MASK]0 government officials had been suspected of being Scientologi[MASK]ts and in 48 cases the suspicions were[MASK]confirm[MASK]d , but apart [MASK]rom some isolat[MASK]d cases , most of the[MASK]officials concerned had not used their positions to advertis[MASK] Scientology . According t[MASK] Fifka & Sydora ( 2009 ) , it is unknown to what degree the " Clear Germany [MASK] programme is still being pursued .

[MASK]
 Germa[MASK] public discourse does not regard Scientology as a religion ,[MASK]but generally characterizes it as a Sekte[MASK]( cult or sect [MASK] , or as an ex[MASK]loitative pro[MASK]it @-@ making vent[MASK]re preying on vulnerable minds . Public concer[MASK]s about the potential dange[MASK][MASK][MASK]posed by cults date back to the early 1970s , when widespread debate [MASK]ook place about " youth[MASK]religions " such as the Unification Church , ISKCO[MASK] , Children of God , and[MASK]the Divine Light Mission . The most prominent criti[MASK]s of these new religious movements were the " sect commissioners " ( Sektenbeauftragte ) of Germany[MASK]'s Protestant Churches , who also actively promoted th[MASK] establishment of private " in[MASK]tiatives of parents and [MASK]oncerned persons " . Aktion [MASK]ildungsinformation ( " Educational Information Cam[MASK]aign " ) became an important organization dedicated to opposing Scientology ; taking an activist stance , it warne[MASK] people not to get involved with Scientology , filed successful lawsuits against the Church of Scientology over its prosely[MASK]izing in public places , and published an influential book , The Sect[MASK]of Scientology an[MASK] its Front Organizations . In 1981 , the organization 's founder , Ingo Heine[MASK]ann , became the director of Aktion für gei[MASK]tige und psychische Freiheit[MASK]( " Campaign for Intellectual and Psychic Freedom " ) , Germany 's most prominen[MASK] anti @-@ cult organization . Warnings from sect experts about the influence of new religious movements gained media attention which put political pressure on the governmen[MASK] to deal with the situation ; as th[MASK] movements we[MASK]e not do[MASK]ng [MASK]nything illegal , the gover[MASK]ment resorted to issuing a range of leaflets and public state[MASK]ents giv[MASK]ng g[MASK]neral warnings about religious sects , the e[MASK]rliest of these publicati[MASK]ns [MASK]ppearing in 1[MASK]79 . 
 Fueled by events such as t[MASK]e Waco Siege in 1993 , the murders and suicides [MASK]ssociated with the Order of the Sol[MASK]r Temple , and the 1995 Au[MASK] Shinrikyo incidents in Japan , German fears and concerns about new religious movements [MASK]ained in intensity in the 1990s , w[MASK]th Scientology attracting particular attention . Percept[MASK]ons that Scientology had a totalitarian character were reinforced when Robert Vaughn Young[MASK], an Ameri[MASK]an ex @-@ Sci[MASK]ntologist[MASK]and former PR official in the Church of Scientology , visited German officials in late 1995 and wrote an article in Der Spi[MASK]gel , a widely @-@ read weekly magazine , describing Scientology as a totalitarian system operating a gulag [MASK] the Rehabilitation Project Fo[MASK]ce – for members of Scientology 's Sea Org found guilty [MASK]f trans[MASK]ressions . From the mid @-@ 1990s onward [MASK] press articles , reports and[MASK]essays on Scientology appeared on an a[MASK]most dai[MASK]y b[MASK]sis , accompanie[MASK] by books and television p[MASK]ogrammes that reached a mass au[MASK]ienc[MASK] . 
 As noted by the religious scholar Hu[MASK]ert Seiwert , Scientology came to be seen as a " serious political danger that not only threatened to turn ind[MASK]viduals into will @-@ less zombies , but was also conspir[MASK]ng to overthrow the democ[MASK]atic constitution of the state " . [MASK]his view of Scientology as a public enemy , Seiwert adds , " became a matter of political [MASK]orrectness " : senior political figures became involved in launching campaigns[MASK]against Scientology , and being suspected o[MASK] any association with it resu[MASK]ted in social ostracism . Stephen A. Kent , writing in 1998 , noted t[MASK]at officials at all levels of German government shared the insistence that Scientology should be suppressed . Scientology was viewed as " a totalitarian , business @-@ driven organiz[MASK]tion [ ... ] guilty of significant human rights abuses . " Officials exami[MASK]ing primary and se[MASK]ondary sources , legal documents , and the testimony of former members , concluded that the organization was " an[MASK]ithetica[MASK] to a democratic state " . Federal ministries an[MASK] st[MASK]te governments were asked to use all legal mea[MASK]s at their disposal to check the activities of Scientology . 
 G[MASK]vernment public[MASK]tions on the dangers of sects i[MASK]cr[MASK]ased between 1996 and 1998 , and a significant number of them dealt with the C[MASK]urch of Scientology . The Ger[MASK]an courts had approved such publications in 1989 ,[MASK]se[MASK]ing them as part of the government 's responsibility to keep the public informed , and fin[MASK]ing that they did not interfere with religious freedom . In 1996 , the German parliament launched an Enq[MASK]ete ( Enquiry ) Commission to investigate sects and similar g[MASK]oups , in large part because of public concerns about Scientology . Its final rep[MASK]rt , published in June 1998 , conclu[MASK]ed that Scientology , alone among new religious movements , required monitoring b[MASK] Germany 's domestic intelligen[MASK]e services . 
 An area of widespread concern in the German media has been the alleged " infiltration " of businesses by Scientologists , in[MASK]line[MASK]with Scientology 's decl[MASK]red aim to penet[MASK]ate society , politics and business in preparation[MASK]for world domination . Attempts to infiltrate businesses have reportedly been most successful among small and medium [MASK]-[MASK] size companies , such a[MASK] estate agents , management consultants and management @-@ training companies . Management @-@ consultancy firms led by Scientologists often conceal their associ[MASK]tion [MASK]ith Scientology ; once they have recruited members of their clients[MASK]' upper management , thes[MASK] man[MASK]gers may send employees to Scientology trainers , as part of company education and training programmes , without informing t[MASK]em as to the origin of the training methods used . An expensive commercial version of Scientology 's Oxford Capacity Analysis , usually offered free as part of Scientology pr[MASK]selytizing in public places , tem[MASK][MASK]rarily entered some major German companies [MASK] who were unaware of its provenance ) via[MASK]such a management @-@ consultancy firm . 
 In the mid @-@ 200[MASK]s , German sect experts expressed concerns [MASK]hat Scientologists were becoming act[MASK]ve in the German after @-@ school tutoring market . These concerns arose bec[MASK]use customers of around 20 after[MASK]@-@ school tutoring centres operated by Scientologists in Frankfurt , Hamburg , Stuttgart and els[MASK]wher[MASK] might be unaware that their children wer[MASK] being ta[MASK]ght by Scientologist[MASK] , using Scientology [MASK]ethods . Brochures advertising the tutoring s[MASK]rvices would at most mention the name of L. Ron Hubbard , the founder of Scientology , but not Sci[MASK]ntology itse[MASK]f . 
 In early 2008 , Thomas Gandow , Sect Commissioner of the German Lutheran Church in Berlin and Brandenburg , and the historian Guido Knopp [MASK]oth [MASK]ikened the Scientologist Hollywood actor Tom Cruise to Goebbels , the Nazi propaga[MASK]da minister . Gandow and Knopp cited a le[MASK]ked[MASK]Scientology video in whi[MASK]h C[MASK]uise was seen asking the audience whether Scientologists should " clean up "[MASK]the world , the audience responding with enthusiastic cheers – cheers which Gandow a[MASK]d K[MASK]opp felt were reminiscent of the audience 's response to Goebbels ' famous question , " Do you want total wa[MASK] ? " Gandow 's and Knopp 's comments found few critics in German[MASK] . Most Germans consider Scientology a subversive organization . In 1997 , Time reporte[MASK] that 70 % of Germans favoured banning Scientology ; a poll conducted in September 2008 by Der Spiegel found 67 % support [MASK]or a ban . 
 German scholars such as Brig[MASK]tte Schön and Gerald Willms have commented that rhet[MASK]ric dominates public discourse ar[MASK]und Scientology in Germany : in their view , efforts to " frame " in[MASK]ormation in such a way as to shape opinion have long been more important than the underlying realities . In Schön 's words , this includes both the " efforts of German politicians to enhance the[MASK]r popularity with strong @-@ worded statements " and " Scientology 's efforts to present itself as the victim of unjust persec[MASK]tion " ; commen[MASK]ing on foreign reporting on Scientology in Germany , she adds that " the American press may prefer sensationalist news to boring investigation and [MASK]ay frame the issue according to American stereotypes " . Both Willms and Schön assert that the situation is compounded by the gen[MASK]ral paucity of scientifi[MASK] studies of Scientology . Schön as well as Irving Hexham , Professor of Religious[MASK]Studies at the University of Calgary in Canada , have remarked in particular on the lack of academic studies by German scholars . Hexham attributes this situation to t[MASK]e strong influence of the Christian churches in Germany , which has made German academics wary of approaching the subject , because they fear repercussions for their research funding and for their prospects of future emplo[MASK]ment if they involve themselves in the debate . 
 In[MASK]2010 a German public broadcaster , ARD , showed the film Until Nothing Remains , a[MASK]dra[MASK]atized accoun[MASK] of the effect Scientology had on one German family . Said to be based on a true[MASK]story , the film a[MASK]tracted widespread media attention and a viewership of 8 @.@ 69 million .

Two points are contested : first , whether or not the teachings of Scientology qualify as a "[MASK]religion or worldview " ( Religion or Weltanschauung ; these are equal before German law ) , and se[MASK]ondly , whether [MASK]r not these teachings are only used as a pretext[MASK]for purely commercial activ[MASK]ty ; if the latter were the cas[MASK] , th[MASK]s would most likely imply that Scientology would not qualify for protection as a " religious o[MASK] worldview com[MASK]unity " ( Religions- oder Weltanschauungsgemeinschaft ) under Article 4 of the German constitution , w[MASK]ich guarantees th[MASK] freedom of belief , rel[MASK]gion and w[MASK]rldview . Status [MASK]s a " religious or worldview[MASK]community " also affects a broad range of other issues in [MASK]ermany , such as taxation and[MASK]freedom of association . 
 The Federal Court of Justice of Germany has not yet made an explicit decision on the matter , but implicitly assumed in 1980 that Scientology represented a religious or world[MASK]iew community . The[MASK]Upper Administrative Court in Hamburg explici[MASK]ly asserted in 19[MASK]4 that[MASK]Scientology sho[MASK]ld be viewed as a world[MASK]iew community . In 1995 , the Federal Labor Court of Germany decided that the Church of Scientology merely pursued commercial[MASK]aims and did not represent a religious or worldview c[MASK]mmunity entitled to protection under Ar[MASK]icle 4 of the German Consti[MASK]ution , although another decision b[MASK] the same court left the question open again in 2003 . I[MASK] another 2003 decision , the Administrative Court of Baden @-@ Württemberg in Ma[MASK]nheim said there were no indicat[MASK]ons that the teachings of Scientology merely served as a pretext for commercial activity . In 2005 , the Federal Administrative Court of Germany explicitly granted a Scientologist protection under Article 4 @.@ 1 of the Germ[MASK]n Constitution , which declare[MASK] the freedom of religion and worldview i[MASK]violate [MASK] 
 Many courts have declined to [MASK]ssess the reli[MASK]i[MASK]us status of Scientology , finding that the que[MASK]tion was irrelevant to deciding the cas[MASK] at hand . The Federal A[MASK]ministrative Cou[MASK]t for example ruled in 1997 that the question whether or not Scientology was a religion [MASK]as irrele[MASK]ant , and that[MASK]its legal status should[MASK]be judged by its business activities . The German government does not consider the Church [MASK]f Scientology to be a religious or worldview community and asserts that Scientology is a profit @-@ making enterprise , rather than a religion . Rece[MASK]t years have seen [MASK] number of court deci[MASK]ions in Sc[MASK]entology 's favour , despite the very widespread negative attitude to S[MASK]ientology among politicians and the general public .

[MASK]Given the history of Nazism 's rise to power in Germany in the 1930s , the present German state has committed itself to taking active steps to prevent the rise of any ideology that threatens the values enshrined in the German constitution . The BfV domestic intelligence service ( Bund[MASK]samt für Verfassungsschutz , or Federal Office f[MASK]r the Pro[MASK]ection of the Constitution ) regards the aims o[MASK] Scientology as running counter to Germany 's free and democratic order , and has been monitoring Scientology since 1997 , as have the Offices for the Protection [MASK]f the Cons[MASK]i[MASK]ution in a number of German Länder . Minister for[MASK]Famil[MASK] Policy Claudia Nolte instituted the surveillance , say[MASK]ng that the church had totali[MASK]arian tendencies and that she wou[MASK]d oppose Scientology with all the means at her disposal[MASK]. 
 The German Church of Scientology has repeatedly challenged the legality of this surveillance in court . In December 2001 , the Administrative Court in Berlin ruled against the Berlin Office for the Protection of the Constitution and ordered it to stop the recruitment and deployment of staff and mem[MASK]ers of the Church of Scientolo[MASK]y Berlin as pa[MASK]d inform[MASK]nts . The court ruled that the use of infor[MASK]ants was disproportiona[MASK]e . In 2003 , the same cou[MASK]t ruled that it was illegal for the Berlin Office for the Protection of the Constitution t[MASK] in[MASK]lude the activities of Scientology in its report , given that the report did not [MASK]ocument any activities that were opposed to the constitution[MASK]. 
 At the fede[MASK]al level , Scientology lost a complaint against continue[MASK] surveillance by the[MASK]BfV in November 2004 . The federal c[MASK]urt based its opinion on [MASK]ts judgment that the aim[MASK] of Scientology , as outlined by L. Ron Hubbard in his writings , were in[MASK]ompatible with the German constitution . Lawyers acting for the Federal Office fo[MASK] the Protection of the Constitution pointed out that Hubbard had[MASK]written that civil rights , for example ,[MASK]should be restricted to Scientologis[MASK]s , and they asserted that the Scientology organization was taking systemati[MASK] steps to infil[MASK]ra[MASK]e society and government institutions in order to prevent [MASK]nti @-@ Scientology legislation . Opposing counsel acting for the Church o[MASK] Sc[MASK]entology had contended that Scientology was non @-@ political , its aims were the liberation of the human being [MASK] and that Hubbard 's [MASK]nstructions were valid only within the Church of Scientolog[MASK] and were subject to interpretation , and at [MASK]ny rate there was no effort to implement these instru[MASK]tions in Germany . The court disagreed and ruled that many sources , some of them not accessib[MASK]e to the[MASK]general public , indicated that the aims of the Church of Scientology did include the abrogation of the principle of equality and other essent[MASK]al human righ[MASK]s . 
 In Saarland ,[MASK]surveillance was stopped by a court as inapprop[MASK]iate in 2005 , because there is n[MASK] local branch of Scientology and few members . As of 6 May 2008 , the Church of Scientology in Germany dropped the legal battle to prevent surveillance of its activities by the BfV after the North Rhine @-@ Westphalia Higher Admini[MASK]t[MASK]ative Court in Münster refused to hear an a[MASK]peal on the ma[MASK]ter . Being suspected of maintaining [MASK] ambitions against [MASK]he free , democratic basic ord[MASK]r " , the Scientology organization added a d[MASK]claration on human rights and democracy to its bylaws . 
 There is at least one example of surveillance of[MASK]Scientology [MASK]y the German intelligence services outside of Germany . In 1[MASK]98 , the Swiss governm[MASK]nt detained an agent of the German government , charging[MASK]him with " [MASK]arrying out illeg[MASK]l [MASK]usiness for a foreign state , working[MASK]for a pol[MASK]tical infor[MASK]ation servi[MASK]e and fal[MASK]ifying identity documents " . The German[MASK]government posted bail for the agent . He was eventually given a 30 @-@ day suspended jail sentence for spying on Scientology , and the German government apologized to Switzerla[MASK]d for the incident . 
 
 =[MASK]= " Sect filters " = = 
 
 A " sect filter " , also known as a " protective declaration[MASK]" ( Schutzerklärung ) , is a document that requires prospective business partners or employees to acknowledge any association wit[MASK] a sect or new religious movement before entering a business or employment contract . Such sect filt[MASK]rs , prima[MASK]ily used to screen out Scientologists , have been drafted by German government agencies for use by businesses . " Sect commissioner 's " offices exist[MASK]in[MASK]Germany as part of regional [MASK]r local government . 
 A work instruction introd[MASK]ced in 1996 requires government staff in the Arbeitsämter – local employ[MASK]ent agencies and s[MASK]cial security [MASK]ffices operated by the Federal Ministry [MASK]f Labour and Social Affairs – to mark companies owned [MASK]y Scientologists with th[MASK] letter " S " . Where compani[MASK]s are suspected of having Scientologist staff , prosp[MASK]ctive employees are alerted to this fact by government staff . Government offi[MASK]ials have publicised the names of individual Scientologists and conducted media campaigns against th[MASK]ir businesses ; some businesspeople have placed advertisements in the press saying they a[MASK]e not Scientologists in order to avoid the associated stigma . 
 Du[MASK] to conce[MASK]ns about possible govern[MASK]ent i[MASK]filtrati[MASK]n by Scientolo[MASK]ists , applicants for civil service positions in Bava[MASK]i[MASK] are required to declare whether or not the[MASK] are Scientologists , and a similar policy has been instituted in Hesse . [MASK]ompanies tendering for government contracts were likewise required to state they are not Scie[MASK]tologists ; in 2001 , this [MASK]equirement was changed , and firms are no[MASK] asked to sign a form stating that " the technology[MASK]of L. Ron Hubbard will not be[MASK]used in executing the contract " . When it [MASK]ecame known that Microso[MASK]t 's Windows 2000 operating [MASK]ystem[MASK]included a disk defragmenter developed by Executive Software International ( a compa[MASK]y headed by a Scientologist ) , this[MASK]caused concern among German governm[MASK]nt [MASK]fficials and clergy[MASK]over data security and the potential for espionage . To assuage the[MASK]e concerns , Microsoft German[MASK] agreed to provide a means to[MASK]disable the utility . Following letters of complaint about discrimination from Scientology lawyers , some American[MASK]companies such as General Electric , IBM and Ford Motor Company instructed their German subsidiaries to cease the use of protective declarations . [MASK] The city @-@ state of Hamburg set up a full @-@ time office dedicat[MASK]d to opposing Scientolo[MASK]y , the[MASK]Scientology Task Force for the Hamburg Interior Authority , under the leadership of[MASK]Ursula Caberta . In 2005 , in a c[MASK]se brought by a Scientologist , the Federal Administrative Cour[MASK] of Germany ordered the city of Ha[MASK]burg to cease recommending the use of protective declarations to its busi[MASK]ess community , finding that the practice infringed religious freedom . In June 2008 , the Ham[MASK]urg Administrative Court fined the city of Hamburg 5 @,@ 000 Euros ([MASK]$ 7 @,@ 000 ) for not complying with cour[MASK] instructions [MASK]anning the use of " sect filters . " Internet links to sampl[MASK] filters to be used by [MASK]usinesses had conti[MASK]ued to remain[MASK]available . Eileen Barker , a p[MASK]ofessor of sociology at the London School of Economics , has noted that " Ger[MASK]any has gon[MASK] further than any other Western European country in restricting the[MASK]civil rights of Scientologists . " The[MASK]Hamburg task force was closed down in August 2010 as a result of budget cuts ; Caberta mov[MASK]d to a position within the Hambu[MASK]g interior authority , where sh[MASK] continues her work on Scientology . 
 Scientologists have been banned from joining major political p[MASK]rties [MASK]n Germany such as the Christian Democratic Union , the Christian Soci[MASK]l Union of Bavaria , the Social Democratic Party of Germany and the Free Democratic Party . Existing Scientologist members of these parties [MASK]ave been " purged " , according to Time Magazine . Scientologists have been prevente[MASK] fr[MASK]m running em[MASK]loyment and au pair agencies in G[MASK]rmany ; Scie[MASK]tologists who were running such agencies had their permi[MASK]s revoked . In 1995 , a sports scientist and fo[MASK]mer member of [MASK]he German [MASK]ational fencing team was dismissed from[MASK][MASK]is job at the German Oly[MASK]pic fenci[MASK]g centre after he stated in an interview that he h[MASK]d enjoyed reading[MASK]books by L. Ron Hubb[MASK]rd and had participated in a course run by a Scientologist mana[MASK]ement and communication consultancy firm . Thoma[MASK] Gottschalk , a German TV prese[MASK]ter , was falsely acc[MASK]sed in 1993 of having ta[MASK]en part in Scientology courses ; Gottschalk responded by [MASK]nnouncing that he had not , and that he would[MASK]he[MASK]cefo[MASK]th cease all contact with a friend who had links to Scientology . In 2007 [MASK] Günther Oet[MASK]inger , the Minister [MASK]-@ President of the German state of Baden @-@ Württemberg , expressed concern that Scientologist John Travolta was to appear on Gottschalk 's programme , and a[MASK]ked the ZDF TV station to consider revoking the invitation ; the ZDF said that uninv[MASK]ting Travolta would cause greater damage , and that Scientology was not going to be discussed in the programme . 
 In 2010 , the Bavarian Administrative Court r[MASK]led that a woman working in a children 's daycare cent[MASK]e , whose employ[MASK]ent had been terminated[MASK]when her ex[MASK]@-@ husband identified her as a Scientologist , should be reinstated . The woman had demonstrated[MASK]to the court 's[MASK]satisfac[MASK][MASK]on that her Scientological beliefs were [MASK]rrelevant to her work . According to the agreement that concluded the case , she prom[MASK]sed n[MASK]t to use Scientology methods in her[MASK]work , and to inform the child[MASK]en 's parents of her membership in Scientology .[MASK]

 In March 2007 , it was reported that G[MASK]rman authorities were increasing their[MASK]efforts to monitor Scientology in response to the opening of a new Scientology headquarters in Berlin[MASK]. On December 7 , [MASK]007 , German federal and state interior ministers [MASK]xpress[MASK]d[MASK]the opin[MASK]on that the Scientology organization w[MASK]s continuing to pursue[MASK]anti @-@ constituti[MASK]nal goals , restricting " essential basic and human rights like the dignity of man or the right to equal treatment " , and asked Germany 's domestic intelligence agencies to collect and evaluate the information req[MASK]ired for a po[MASK]sible judicial inquiry aimed at banning the organization . 
 The move was criticized by German politicians from all sides of the political spectrum , with legal experts and intelligence agencies expressing concern that[MASK]an attempt to ban the [MASK]rganization would li[MASK]ely fail in the courts . Sabine Weber , president of the Church of Scientology in Berlin , called the accusations " unrealistic " and " absurd " and said th[MASK]t the German interior ministers ' evaluation was based on " a few senten[MASK]es out of 500 @,@ 000 pages of Scientological li[MASK]erature " . She added ,[MASK]" I can also find hu[MASK]dreds of quotes in the[MASK]Bible that are totalitarian b[MASK]t that doesn 't mean I will demand t[MASK]e ban of Christianity . " 
 In November 2008 , the gover[MASK]ment [MASK]bandoned its attempts to ba[MASK] Scientology , a[MASK]ter finding insuffici[MASK]nt evidence of illegal or unconstitutional activity . The report [MASK]y the BfV cited k[MASK]o[MASK]ledge gaps and noted several point[MASK] that would make the[MASK]success of any legal undertaking to ban Scientology doubtful . First , the BfV report s[MASK]ated there was no evidence that Scientology c[MASK]uld [MASK]e viewed as a foreign [MASK]rganization ; there were German churches and missions , a German bo[MASK]rd , German bylaws , and no evidence that the organization was " totally remote @-@ controlled " from the United S[MASK]ates . A foreign organization would have been much easier to ban than a German one . The second argument on whic[MASK] those proposing the ban had counted was Sci[MASK]n[MASK]ology 's aggressive opposition to the [MASK]onstitu[MASK]ion . Here , the report found [MASK]hat Scientology '[MASK] behaviou[MASK] gave no grounds to assume that Scientology aggressively sou[MASK]ht [MASK]o attack and overthrow Germany 's free and democratic basic order[MASK]. " Neither its bylaws n[MASK]r any other utterances " supported[MASK]the " conclusion th[MASK]t the organization had[MASK]criminal aims "[MASK]. The[MASK]BfV also considered whether there were gr[MASK]unds to act[MASK]against the Church of Scientology on the basis that they were practising medicine without a licence , b[MASK]t expressed doubts that a court would accept this reaso[MASK]ing . 
 Commenting on the decision to drop the ban attempt , Ehrhart Körting , Berlin[MASK]'s interior minister , said , " This organization pursues goals – through its writings , its conce[MASK]t and its disrespect for minorities – that we cannot tolerate and that we consider in violation of the constitution . But they put very little of this into practice . The appraisal of th[MASK] Government at the moment is that [ Scientology ] is a lousy organization , but it is[MASK]not[MASK]an organ[MASK]za[MASK]ion that[MASK]we have to take a h[MASK]mmer to . [MASK] [MASK]he Church of Sciento[MASK]ogy expressed satisfaction with the decision , describing it as [MASK]he " only one possible " . M[MASK]nitoring of Scientology 's activities by the German intelligence services continues .[MASK]
 In February 2009 , the Berlin Administrative Court ruled that a poster plac[MASK]d by local city authorities on an [MASK]dvertising column next to a bus stop in front[MASK]o[MASK] the Berlin Scientology headquarters , warning passers @-@ by of the potential dangers Scientology activities posed to de[MASK]ocracy and i[MASK]dividual freedom , [MASK]hould be removed[MASK]. The decision was upheld in July 2009 by the Uppe[MASK] Administrative Court[MASK]of Berlin @-@[MASK]Brandenburg which ruled that the poster violated Scientologists ' basic religious rights .

 The U[MASK]ited States media , while generally reporting negatively on Scientology in domestic news , has taken an at least partially su[MASK]portive stanc[MASK] towards Sci[MASK]ntology in relation to Germany . Richard Co[MASK]en for exa[MASK]ple , wr[MASK]ting in the Washington Post , said[MASK]in 1996 : " Scientology might be one weird religion , but the German [MASK]eaction to it is weirder still – not to mention[MASK]disturbing . " Alan Cowe[MASK]l , writing in the New York Times , wrote [MASK]n 1997 that the German response to [MASK]cientology – motivated by officia[MASK]s ' fear that [MASK]cientology " was a totalitarian[MASK]movement growing , like the Nazi part[MASK] , from inconsequential beginn[MASK]ngs " – was itsel[MASK] redolent of " the Nazi era[MASK]'s au[MASK]horit[MASK]rianism " . 
 The U.S. Department of[MASK]State [MASK]as repeatedly claimed that Germany 's a[MASK]tions constitute g[MASK]vernment and societal discrimination against minority religious groups and ex[MASK]ressed it[MASK] concerns over the violation[MASK]of Sciento[MASK]o[MASK]ists ' i[MASK][MASK]ividual rights posed by sect filters . The U.S. Department of State began to include the issue of Scientology[MASK]in Germany in it[MASK] annual human rights reports after [MASK]h[MASK] 1993 agreement between the Church of Scientology and the U.S. Internal Revenue Service , through which Scientol[MASK]gy gained the status of a tax @-@ exempt religion in[MASK]the United States . That decision also marked the beginning of more intense lobbying efforts [MASK]y the Church of Scientology in Washington , using paid lobbyists . The[MASK]State Department 's 1996 human rights report on Ger[MASK]any , released in January 1997 , warned that artists and businesses with Scientology connections " may face boycotts and discrimination , sometime[MASK] with government approval . " Past targets of such actions had included Scientologist actors Tom Cruise and John Travolta , as well as jazz pianist Chic[MASK] Corea . 
 Also in [MASK]anuary 1997 , [MASK]n open let[MASK]er[MASK]to then[MASK]@-@ Chancellor Helmut Kohl appeare[MASK] , published as a newspap[MASK]r advertisement in th[MASK] International Her[MASK]ld Tribune , dra[MASK]ing parallels betwe[MASK]n the " organized oppression [MASK] of Scientologists in Germany and Nazi policies espoused by Germany [MASK]n the 1930s . The letter was[MASK]conceived and paid for by Hollywood lawyer Bertram Fields , whose clie[MASK]ts have incl[MASK]ded Tom Cruise and John Travolta , a[MASK]d was[MASK]si[MASK]ned by 34 prominent figures in the U.S. entertainment industry , including the top executives of MGM , Warner Bros. , Paramount , Universal and Sony Picture[MASK] Entertainment as well as acto[MASK]s Dustin Hoffman and Goldie Hawn , director Oliver Ston[MASK] , writers Mario[MASK]Puzo and Gore Vidal and talk [MASK]-@ show host Larry King . It echoe[MASK][MASK]simil[MASK]r p[MASK]rallels drawn by the Church of Scientology itself , which until then had received scant notice , and wa[MASK] followed by lobbying efforts of Scientology cel[MASK]brities in Washington . 
 U.S. Department of State spokesman Nicholas Burns rejected the Nazi comparisons in the open letter as " outr[MASK]geous " and [MASK]istanced [MASK]he U.S. gov[MASK]rnment from Nazi co[MASK]parisons made by the Church of Scientology , sayi[MASK]g , " We have criticized the Germans on this , but we aren 't going to support the Scientologists ' terror tactics against the German government . " Chancellor Kohl , commentin[MASK] on the letter , said that those who signed it " don 't know a thing about Germany and don 't want to know . " G[MASK]rm[MASK]n officials arg[MASK]ed that " the whole fuss was cranked up by the Scientologists to achieve what we won 't give them : tax @-@ exempt status as a religion . This is intimidation , pure and sim[MASK]le . " Officials explained that precisely because of Germany 's Nazi past , Germany took[MASK]a determined stance against all " radic[MASK]l cults and sects , in[MASK]luding right @-@ wi[MASK]g Nazi g[MASK]oups " , and not just against Scientology . Kohl 's Christian Democratic Union party denounced the letter as " absurd " and cited[MASK]German court rulings stating[MASK]that Scientology had primarily econ[MASK]mic goals and could legitimately be referred to using phrases such as a " contemptuous cartel of oppression " . 
 In February 1997 , a[MASK]United States immigration court judg[MASK] granted asylum to a[MASK]German Scientologist who claimed she would be subject to religious persecution in [MASK]er homeland . In April 1997 , John Travolta met perso[MASK]ally with U.S. President Bill Clinton at a conference i[MASK] Phil[MASK]delphia .[MASK]Travolta later said Clinton assured him that he would " really love to help " with the " issue over in Germany with Scientology " . According to Travolta , Clinton recalled that " he had a roommate years ago [MASK]ho was a Scientologist and had really liked [MASK]im , and respected his views on it " , stating [MASK]hat Scientologists " were given an unfair hand in [ Germany ] and that he wanted to fix it " . In Sep[MASK]ember 1997 , John Travol[MASK]a , Chick Corea and f[MASK]llow[MASK]Scientologist Isaac Hayes were heard[MASK]by [MASK]he Commission on Security and Cooperation in [MASK]urope ( CSCE , also known as the H[MASK]lsinki Commission ) , voicing their complaints about the treatment of Sc[MASK]entologists in [MASK]erman[MASK] , and had a briefing with Unit[MASK]d States National Security Advisor Sandy Berger , whom Clinton had assigned to be [MASK] the administration 's Scientology point person " . The German ambas[MASK]ador responded with a letter to the CSCE stating that the German government had come to t[MASK]e conclusion that Scien[MASK]ology 's " pseudo @-@ s[MASK]ientific courses can[MASK]seriously jeopardize individuals ' mental and physical health and that it exploits its members " , adding that " membership can lead to psychological and physical dependency , to financial ruin , and even to suicide . In addition , there are indicat[MASK]ons that Scientology poses a threat to G[MASK]rma[MASK]y 's basic polit[MASK]cal principles . " 
 A United Nations report [MASK]n April 1998 raised concerns about the violation of individual rights posed by se[MASK]t filters . However , it rejected the compa[MASK]ison of the treatment of Scientologists with that of Jews during t[MASK]e Nazi era . 
 In 2000 , the German Stern ma[MASK]azine published the results of its investigation of the asylum[MASK]case . It asserted that several rej[MASK]ction letters which the woman had submitted as part of her asylum application – ostensibly from potential employers who [MASK]ere[MASK]rejecting her because she was a Scientologist – had in fact been written by fellow Scientologists at her request and that o[MASK] Scientology '[MASK] Offic[MASK] of Special Affairs , and that she was in personal financial trouble and about to go on trial for tax evasion at the time she applied for asylum . On a 2000 visit[MASK]to Clearwater , Florida , Ursula Caberta of the Scientology Task Force for the Hamburg Interior[MASK]Authority likewise alleged that the asylum case had been part of an " orchestrated [MASK]ffort " by[MASK]Scientology und[MASK]rtaken " for political [MASK]ain " , and " a spectacular abuse of the U.S[MASK] system " . German expatriate Scientologists resident in Clearwater , in turn , accused Caberta of stoking a " hate campaign " in Germany that had " ruined the lives and for[MASK]unes of scores of Scientologists " and mainta[MASK]ned that S[MASK]ientologists had not " exaggerated their plight for political gai[MASK] in the United States . "[MASK]Mark Rathbun , a ( former [MASK] top Church of Scientolog[MASK] official ,[MASK]said that although S[MASK]ientology had not orchestrated the case , " there would have been nothing improper if it h[MASK]d . " 
 In 2003 , Joachim Güntner , writing in the Swiss Neue Zürcher Zeitung , noted that Gerhard B[MASK]sier , [MASK] German Christian theologian , director[MASK]of the Hannah Arendt Insti[MASK]ute for Research into Totalitarianism in Dresden and recipient [MASK]f an honorary doctorate from Lund University , Sweden , for his champi[MASK]ning o[MASK] religious freedom , had be[MASK]n pressured [MASK]o forego publication of[MASK]his scientific study of Scientology after having found himself the subject of widespread criticism in the [MASK]e[MASK]man media for advocating a more tolerant attitude t[MASK]wards Scientology . Güntner concluded that " alarmism " had " triumphed " over [MASK]cience and noted a[MASK] apparent lack of conf[MASK]dence in Germany 's [MASK]bility to engage in open public discourse on the matter . 
 The U.S. Department of State 's 2012 report o[MASK] religious freedom in Germany , published in 2013 , stated that " The status of the Church of Scientology remains in limbo . The Constitutional Court and various courts at [MASK]he state level have not [MASK]xplicitly ruled [MASK]hat Scientology is a religion . Government agencies [MASK]t the fed[MASK]ral and state level have rules and procedures that discriminate against[MASK]Scientology as [MASK] [MASK]roup and [MASK]gainst its members . Four of the major political parties ( the Christian Democratic Union , Christian Social Union , Social Democratic Party , and Free Democra[MASK]ic Party ) ban Scientologists from party membership . [ ... ] Scientologists reported instances of gover[MASK][MASK]ental discrimination . Although courts at the stat[MASK] and federal[MASK]le[MASK]el cond[MASK]mned the improper use of so @-@ called ' sect filters ' to blacklis[MASK] and boycott Scientologists , they remained i[MASK] use in the public sector . ' Sect filters ' typically asked potential new employees to confirm in writing that they had no contact with Scientology , did n[MASK]t p[MASK]rticipate in its training cou[MASK]ses , an[MASK] rejected[MASK][MASK]ts doctrines . [ ... ] Catholic and Protestant churches cont[MASK]nued to oppose Scientology publically [ sic ] , although press reporting and public reactions to Scientology decreased . Several private organizations issued warnings about after @-@ school study programs run by Scientologists . "

 [MASK] Japanese [MASK]attl[MASK]ship Asahi = 
 
 Asahi ( 朝日 , Asahi ) was a pre @-@ dreadnought battlesh[MASK]p built for the Imperial Japanese Navy ( IJN ) in the late 1890s . As Japan lacked the industrial capacity to build such warships itself , t[MASK]e ship was designed [MASK]nd built[MASK]in the United Kingdom . Shortly after her arrival in Japan , she became flagship of the Standing Fleet ,[MASK]the IJN 's primary combat fleet . She participated in every major naval batt[MASK]e of th[MASK] Russo @-@ Japanese War of 1904 – 05 and was l[MASK]ghtly damaged during the Battle of the Yellow Sea and the Battle of Tsushima . Asahi sa[MASK] no combat during World [MASK]ar I , although the ship participa[MASK]ed in the Si[MASK]erian Intervention in 1918 [MASK] 
[MASK]Reclassified as a coastal defence ship in 1921 , Asahi was disarmed two years l[MASK]ter to meet the terms of the Washington Naval Treaty , after which she served as a tra[MASK]ning and s[MASK]bma[MASK][MASK]ne depot ship . She was modified into a submarine sal[MASK]age and rescue ship before being placed in reserve in 1928 . Asahi was recommissioned in late 1937 ,[MASK]after the start of the Second Sino @-@ Japane[MASK]e War [MASK] and [MASK]sed to transp[MASK]rt Japanese troops . In 1938 , she was conv[MASK]rted into a [MASK]epair ship and based first at Japanese @-@ occupied Sh[MASK]nghai , China[MASK], and then Cam Ranh Bay [MASK][MASK]Frenc[MASK] Indochina , from late [MASK]938 to 1941 . The ship was transferred to occupied Singapore in early 1942 to repair a damaged light cruiser and ordered to return home[MASK]in May . She was sunk en route by the American submarine USS Salmon , although most of her cre[MASK] survived .

 Comb[MASK][MASK] experience in the First Sino @-@ Japan[MASK]se War of 1894 – 95 convinced the Imperial Japanese Navy of weaknesses in the Jeune École naval philosop[MASK]y , which emphasi[MASK][MASK]d torpedo boats and commerce raiding to offset expensive heavily armoured ships . Therefore , Japan promulgated a ten @-@ year nava[MASK] buil[MASK] @-@ up in early 1896 , to modernize and expand its fleet in preparation fo[MASK] further confrontation[MASK] , with [MASK]he construction of six battleships and six armoured cruisers at its core . These ships were paid for from the £ 30 @,@ 000[MASK]@,[MASK] 000 indemnity [MASK]aid by China after losing the First Sino @-@ Japa[MASK]ese War . As with the earlier Fuji and Shikishima classes , Japan lacked the technology and capability to construct[MASK]its own [MASK]attleships , and turned again to the Unite[MASK] Kingdom for the fo[MASK]r remaining battl[MASK]ships of the programme .[MASK][MASK]sahi , the fifth Japanese battlesh[MASK]p to be built in Britain , was ordered from the Clydebank Engineering[MASK]& Ship[MASK]uilding Company shipyard in Clydebank , Scotland in the 1897 annual naval programme .

The ship h[MASK]d an overa[MASK]l length of 425 feet 3 inches ( 12[MASK] @.@ 6 m ) , a beam of 75 f[MASK]et ( 22 @.@ 9 m ) , and a normal drau[MASK]ht of 27 feet 3 inches ( 8 @.@ [MASK] m ) . She di[MASK]placed 15 @,@ 200 long tons ( 15 @,@ 400 t ) at normal load . Asahi had a complete double bottom with 55 wa[MASK]ertight compartme[MASK]ts . Her hull was also subdivided into 223 wat[MASK]rtight compartments . She was f[MASK]tted as a flagship [MASK]nd her crew numbered about 773 officers and enlisted men , including the admiral 's staff . 
 The ship was powered by two vertic[MASK]l[MASK]triple @-@ expansion steam engines built by Humphrys , Tennant , each driving one pr[MASK]peller , using steam generated[MASK]by 25 Belleville boilers at a working pr[MASK]ssure of 17 @.@ 03 bar ( 1 @,@ 703 kPa [MASK] 247 psi ) . T[MASK]e engines were[MASK]rated at 15 @,@ 000 indicated horsepower ( 11 @,@ 000 kW ) , using forced draught , and designed to reach a[MASK]top speed of 18 knots ( 33 km / h ; 21 mph [MASK] although Asahi reached 18 @.@ 3 [MASK]nots ( 33 @.@ 9 km / h [MASK] [MASK]1 @.@ 1 mph ) from 16 @,@ 335[MASK][MASK]ndicated horsepower ( 12 @,@ 181 kW ) during her sea trials on 23 March 1900 . S[MASK]e carried a maximum of 2 @,@ 000 long tons ( 2 @,@ 032 t ) of coal w[MASK]ich allowed her to steam for 9 @,@ 000 nautical miles ( 17 @,@ 000 km ; 10 @,@ 000 mi ) at a speed of 10 knots ( 19 km / h ; 12 m[MASK]h ) . The ship was fitted with three steam @-@ drive[MASK] 4 @.@ 8 @-@ kilowatt ( 6 @.@ [MASK] hp ) dynamos . 
 Asahi 's main battery consisted of the same four Els[MASK]ick Ordnance Company 40 @-@ calibre twelve @-@ inch guns used in a[MASK]l of Japan 's[MASK]pr[MASK]ceding battleships . They were mounted in twin @-@ gun turrets fore and aft of the superstructure . The[MASK]hydraulically powered mountings allowed the guns to be loaded at all angles of trave[MASK]se , at a fixed elevation of + 13 @.@ 5 ° . Each mount could trave[MASK]se a tot[MASK]l of 240 degrees . They fired 850 @-[MASK] pound ( 386 kg ) projecti[MASK]es at a muzzle velocity of 2 @,@ 400 ft [MASK] s ( 730 m /[MASK]s ) . 
 The ship 's secondary armament consisted of fourteen 45 @-@ calibre 6 @-[MASK] inch ( 152 mm ) quick @-@ firing ( QF ) guns mounted in casemates . Eight of these guns[MASK]were positioned on the main deck and the other six guns were placed above th[MASK]m in the superstructure . They fired [MASK]00 @-@ pound ( 45 kg ) shells a[MASK] a muzzle velocity of 2 @,@ 300 ft / s ( 700 m / s ) . Protection against torpedo @-@ boat attacks was provided[MASK]by twenty QF 12 @-@ pounder 12 cwt guns . The 12 @-@ pounders fired 3 @-@ inch ( 76 mm ) , 12 @.@ 5 @-@ pound ( 5 @.@ 7 kg ) projectiles at a muzzle velocity of 2 @,@ 359 ft / s ( 719 m / s ) . Lighter guns consisted[MASK]of eight 47 @[MASK]@ millimetre ( 1 @.@ 9 in ) three @-@ pounder Hotchkiss guns and four 47 @-@ millimetre 2 @.@ 5[MASK]@-@ pounder Hotchkiss guns . The former were mounted in the superstructure and the latter in t[MASK]e fighting tops . The three @-@ pounder gun fired 3 @.@ 19 @[MASK]@ pound [MASK] 1 @.@ 45 kg ) projectiles at a m[MASK]zzle velocity of 1 @,@ 927 ft / [MASK] ( 587 m / s ) , while the[MASK]2 @.@[MASK]5 @-@ pounder f[MASK]red 2 @.@ 5 @[MASK]@ pound ( 1 @.@ 1 kg ) shells at a muzzle [MASK]elocity of 1 @,@ 420 ft / s ( 430 m / s[MASK]) . The ship was also equipped with four submerged 18 @-[MASK] inch torpedo tubes , two on each broadside . 
 The waterline main belt of Asahi consisted of Harvey armour 8 feet [MASK] 2 @.@ 44 m ) hig[MASK] , of which 3 feet [MASK] inc[MASK]es ( 1 @.@ 11 m ) was above th[MASK] waterline at normal load , and had a maximum thickness of 9 inches ( 229 mm ) for the middle 224 feet ( 68 @.@ 28 m ) of the ship . It was only 4 inch[MASK]s ( 102 mm ) thick at the ends of the ship and was surmounted by a six @-@ inch strake o[MASK] armour that ran between the barbettes . The barbettes were 14 inches ( 356 mm ) thick [MASK] but only 10 inches ( [MASK]54 mm ) behind the upper armour strake . The barb[MASK]tte hoods were protected by 10 inches of armour [MASK]n their face while their sides were[MASK]6 inches thick and the roof was 1 @.@ 5 inches ( 38 mm ) t[MASK]ick . Diagonal bulkhe[MASK]ds connecting the barbette[MASK] to the side armour were 12 [MASK] 14 inches thic[MASK] , but only 6 inches thick at the lower deck [MASK]evel . The frontal armour of the casemates protecting the secondary armament was also 6 inches thick with the rear protected by 2 @-@ inch ( 51 mm [MASK] armour plates . T[MASK]e flat portion of the deck armour was 2 @.@ 5 inches ( 64 mm ) thick and 4 inches ( 102 mm ) thick where it [MASK]loped down[MASK]to the sides of the ship . The conning tower was prote[MASK]ted by 14 inches[MASK]of armour . 
 Asahi[MASK],[MASK]like all t[MASK]e other Japanese battleships of the time , was fitted with four[MASK]Barr and[MASK]Stroud FA3 co[MASK]ncidence rangefinders tha[MASK] had an effective range of 8 @,@ 000 yards ([MASK]7 @,@ 300 m ) . The ships [MASK]ere also fitted with 24 @-@ power magnification telescopic gunsight[MASK] .[MASK]

 Asahi[MASK], meaning " rising sun " , a poetic name for J[MASK]p[MASK]n from a stanza of waka poetry , was laid down on 1 August 1898 in Clydebank , Scotland , by the Clydebank Engineering & Sh[MASK]pbuilding Co. and completed by John Brown & [MASK]ompany , which purchased the f[MASK]rm before Asahi was completed . She was launched on 13 March 1899 and completed on 31 July 1900 . Her completion was delayed by a[MASK]out [MASK]hree months w[MASK]en her bottom p[MASK]ating requ[MASK]r[MASK]d repairs after running aground off Southsea following sea trials . The ship departed England , after repairs in Portsmouth , on the day of her completion , and arrived at Yokosu[MASK]a , Japan , on 23 October 1900 . Asahi[MASK]became flagship of the Standing Fleet [MASK]n 22 May [MASK]901 and was assig[MASK]ed to the 1s[MASK] Battleship Divis[MASK]on of the 1st Fleet when the Combined Fleet was re @-@ formed on 28 December 1903 . 
 At the [MASK]tart of the Russo @-@ Japanese War , Asahi , commanded by Captain Hikohachi Yamada , wa[MASK] assigned to t[MASK]e 1st Division of the 1st Fleet . Sh[MASK] participated in the Battle of Port Arthur on 9 February 1904 , when Vice Admiral Tō[MASK]ō Heihachirō led the 1st Fleet in an attack on the Russian ships o[MASK] the Pacific Squadron anchored just outside Port Arthur . Tōgō had expected the surprise night attack by his destroyers to be much more successful[MASK]than it was , anticipating that the Russians would be badly disorganized and weakened ,[MASK]but they had recover[MASK]d from their surprise and were ready for his attack . The Japanese ships were sp[MASK]tted by the protected cruiser Boyarin , which was patrolling offshore and alerted the Russian defences . Tōgō chose to attack the Russian coastal defences with his [MASK]ain armament and engage the ships with his secondary guns . Split[MASK]ing his fire proved to be a poor decision as the Japanes[MASK] e[MASK]ght @-@ inch ( 203 mm ) and six[MASK]@-@ i[MASK]ch guns inflict[MASK]d little damage on the Russian sh[MASK]ps , which concentrated all their fire on the Japanese ships with some effect . Although many ships on both sides were hit , Russian casualties numbered only 17 , while the Japanese suffered 60 killed and wounded before Tōgō disengaged . Asahi wa[MASK] not hit during the engagement . 
 The ship participated in the action of 13 April , when Tōgō successf[MASK]lly lured out a portion of the Pacific Squadron , including Vice Admiral Stepan Makarov 's flagship , the battleship Petropavlovsk . When Makarov sp[MASK]tted the f[MASK]ve battleships of the 1st Division , he turned back [MASK]or Port Arthur and Petropavlovsk struck a minefi[MASK]ld laid by the Japanese the previous ni[MASK]ht .[MASK]The Russian battleship sank in less than two minutes after one of her magazines exploded , and Makarov was one of th[MASK] 677 killed . Emboldened by his success , Tōgō resumed long @-@ ra[MASK]ge bombardment mis[MASK]ions[MASK], [MASK]rompting the Russians to lay more minefields , which sank two Japanese b[MASK]ttleships the following month .[MASK]
 During the Battle of the Yellow Sea on 10 August , Asahi , now commanded by Captain Tsunaakira Nomoto , was second in line of the column of Japa[MASK]ese battleships , behind [MASK]ikasa , and [MASK]as one of the p[MASK]imary targets of the Russi[MASK]n ships . She was onl[MASK] hit by a single 12 @-@ inch shell [MASK]hat [MASK]o[MASK]nded two crewmen . Both guns in h[MASK]r[MASK]aft 12 @-@ inch gu[MASK] turr[MASK]t , however , were disabled by shell[MASK] [MASK]hat deto[MASK]ated prematurely in their barrels[MASK]. In turn she concentrated most of her fire upon the battleships Poltava and Tsesarevich although both ships w[MASK]re only lightly[MASK][MASK]amaged by the Japanese shells , which generally failed to penetrate any armour and detona[MASK]e[MASK] on impact[MASK]. The ship made the critical hits of the battle , however , when two[MASK]of her 12 @-@ inch shells struck the bridge of Tsesarevich , killing the Russian squadron comm[MASK]nder , Vice Admiral Wilgelm Vitgeft , two of his staff officers and the shi[MASK] [MASK]s quartermaster . Th[MASK] ship 's wheel was jammed to port by w[MASK]eckage and then slowed to a halt which [MASK]hrew the rest of the Russian ships into tota[MASK] confusion . Th[MASK] second @-@ in @-@ command , Rear Admiral Prince Pavel[MASK]Ukhtomsky , eventually gained control of the remainde[MASK] of the squadron and headed back to Port Arthur . Slightly more than two months later , on 26 October , Asahi struck a mine off Port Arthur while on blockade duty . Severely damaged , she was under repair at Sasebo Naval Arsenal [MASK]rom November 1904 to April 1905 . Russian naval forces in th[MASK] Far East had been destroyed o[MASK] neutra[MASK]ized by th[MASK]s time and the Russians were forced to transfer ships fro[MASK] the Baltic Fleet that did not arrive until May . 
 
 = = = Battle of Tsushima = = = 
 [MASK] At the Battle of Tsushima on 27 May 1905 , Asahi again followed the battleship Mikasa into combat , this time against the Second and Third Pacific Squadrons . Mikasa opened fire at the battleship Knyaz Suvorov , [MASK]he Russian flagship , at 14 : 10 , and was joined b[MASK] Asahi and the armoured cruiser Azuma shortly afterwards . Within an hour the Japanese ships had started a serious fire aboard the Russian ship [MASK] badly[MASK]wounded the fleet commander , Vice Admiral [MASK]inovy Rozhestven[MASK]ky , knocked [MASK]ut her rear 12 @-@ inch gun turret , and jammed Knyaz Suvorov 's steering so [MASK]hat s[MASK]e[MASK]fell out of f[MASK]rmation . Th[MASK] Russian ships were concentrating their fi[MASK]e on Mikasa during the early[MASK]part of the battle and Asahi was no[MASK] damaged during this time . Tōgō was able to cross the T of the Russ[MASK]an squadrons . Knyaz Suvorov 's steering was later repaired , but she blundered [MASK]etween the Japanese and Russian fleets several times l[MASK]ter [MASK]n the battle and was heavily damaged . Asahi seems to h[MASK]ve mostly engaged [MASK]he battleships Borodino and Oryol in the late stages of the battle , although Fuji fired the shots that cause[MASK] the[MASK]Borodino 's magazines to explode and sink her . Asahi fired more twelve @-@ inch shells , 142 , than any other ship during the ba[MASK]tle . In total , the ship was hit six times during the battle , but none of them damaged her significantly . While Asahi [MASK]s casualties are not precisely known , the Japanese only lost 110 men killed and 590 wounded to all ca[MASK]ses during the battle . The ba[MASK]tle was a[MASK]total Japanese victory with five Russian battleships captured and incorporated[MASK]into the IJN . 
 Captain W. C. Pakenham , the Royal Navy 's official militar[MASK] observer under the Anglo @-@ Japanese Alliance , took n[MASK]tes of the battle 's progress from a deck chair on Asahi 's exposed quarterdeck . His report confirmed the superiority of Japan[MASK]se training and tactics and p[MASK]bl[MASK]cized [MASK]he[MASK]victory [MASK]n the West .

[MASK]In 1908 , Asahi was part of the Japanese fleet that escorted the American Grea[MASK] White[MASK]Fleet through Japanese waters during its round @-@ the @-@ globe voyage[MASK]. The ship was assigned[MASK]to the 1st Fleet in 1908 and 1910 – 11 . Asahi became a gunnery [MASK]raining ship in 1914 , an[MASK] was re @-@ armed in 1917 with Japanese gun[MASK] replacing her or[MASK]ginal British @-@ made guns . The same yea[MASK] , she was assigned to the 5th Division of the 3r[MASK] Fleet . In 1918 , Asahi became flagship of her division and participated in the Japanese intervention in the Russian Civil War . She escorted tr[MASK]op convoys to the [MASK]ussian Far East and was guard ship at Kamchatka from January to August 1918 . As[MASK]hi was reclassified as a first @-@ class coastal defence ship on 1 Se[MASK]tember 1921 , and began disarmament in 1922 at Yokosuka in compliance with the terms of the Washington Naval Treaty . She was reclassified as a training and submarine depot s[MASK]ip on 1 April 192[MASK] and her disarmament was completed in July of that same year . Her displacement dropped to [MASK]1 @,@ 441 long t[MASK]ns ( 11 @,@ 62[MASK] t ) with the [MASK]oss of her armour and guns[MASK], and her s[MASK]eed was limited to 12 knots ( 22 km / h ; 14 mph ) . 
 The navy decided to convert Asahi i[MASK]to a submarine salvage ship a[MASK]d she began the first stage of her conversion w[MASK]th the installation of specialized salvage equipment from February to August 1925 . From 1926 to October 1927 , the ship 's 25 Bellev[MASK]l[MASK]e boilers were replaced with four Kanpon Typ[MASK] RO boilers at Kure Naval Arsenal . One of her two funnels was also rem[MASK]ved , and two large lift[MASK]ng frames were installe[MASK] as par[MASK] of the second stage of her conversion . The ship [MASK]onducted experiments in submarine re[MASK]cue using the old German[MASK]submarine 0 @-@ 1 ( ex @-@ U @-@ 125 ) . In May 1928 , Asahi was fitted with a 62 @-@ foot @-@ 4 @-@ inch ( 19 m ) compressed @-@ air aircraft catapult [MASK]n her forecastle and successfully launched an E2N1 Ty[MASK]e 15 seaplane . After repeated accidents , the cata[MASK]ult was replaced by one powered by gunpowder . On the completion of tes[MASK]ing in 1928 , Asahi was placed in reserve . 
 Reclassified as a repair ship on 16 August 1937 , Asa[MASK]i was taken out of reserve in November , after the Marco Polo Bridge Incident that started the Second Sino @-@ Japa[MASK]ese War[MASK], and was used as a tr[MASK]nsport to land troops in an amphibious l[MASK]nding at Hangzhou Bay . Afterwards s[MASK]e began conversion at Kure , Japan , into a repair ship ; this was completed on[MASK]18 December 1938 [MASK] Asah[MASK] was fit[MASK]ed with a dummy w[MASK]oden[MASK]main battery fore and aft to resemble an old[MASK]battleship after her arrival in Shanghai on 29 December . In May 1939 she was modified to act as a t[MASK]rpedo depot ship and carried out patrols be[MASK]ween 29 May and 7 November 1[MASK]40 . She was [MASK]ransferred to Camranh Bay , French Indochina , on 15 November 1940 and later transpo[MASK]ted the 11th Base Unit from Kure to Camranh Bay 19 Nov[MASK]mber – 7 December 1941 . 
 From 13 March 1942 , Asahi was stationed at Singapore , and [MASK]n April her crew performed repairs on the light cruiser Naka , which had been torpedoed by t[MASK]e submarine USS Seawolf off Christma[MASK] Island . Departing Singapore for Ku[MASK]e on 22 May , esc[MASK]rted by the subchaser CH @-@ 9 , Asahi was sighted by the submarine USS Salmon on the night of 25 / 26 May 1942 , 100 miles ( 160 km ) southeast of Cape Padaran , Indo[MASK][MASK]ina . Of Salmon 's four torpedoes , [MASK]wo hit the ship in her port central boiler room and aft spaces . At 01 : 03 , moments after being hit , Asahi [MASK]ank at 10 ° 00 ′ N 110 ° 00 ′ E. Sixteen men were killed in the attack ; the ship 's captain and 582 crewmen were rescued[MASK]by CH @-@ 9 .

 Michael is waiting in a hotel bar for his replacement Deangelo Vickers ( Will Ferrell ) to show up . While waiting , he meets a man at t[MASK]e bar and the[MASK]two instantly hi[MASK] it off . When Michael calls Vickers to see where he is , it is revealed that the man Michael has been talking to is actually Deangelo , though it takes [MASK]he two some time to actuall[MASK] realize this . 
 Deangelo comes to the branch the next day , and most o[MASK] the staff is eager to make a good first impression . Kevin wears his toupee , Jim and Pam believe they have started off well by mentioning their baby , and Deangelo designates Andy as the office " funny guy " when he reveal[MASK] that he carries name tags around to avoid situations like the one Deangelo and Michael were in . Meanwhil[MASK] , Dwight[MASK]is not pleased that he was not [MASK]elected to replace Michael , believing that Michael put in a good[MASK]recommendation for him . Michael becomes disturbe[MASK] , however [MASK] when Deangelo wan[MASK]s to make some changes , such as how Erin answe[MASK]s the phone . 
 While Deangelo gets annoyed with Jim and Pam , he loves the antics of Andy , who has resorted to[MASK]physical comedy when his jokes fall fl[MASK]t , getting to the point where he pour[MASK] hot coffee on his pants and ( at Deangelo 's urging ) eats soap ; Andy tells the camera with dazed [MASK]adness that " this is my life now " . Deangelo 's popularity with the employees causes Michael to get jealous t[MASK] th[MASK] po[MASK]nt where he passes out peanut butter sandwiches , despite Deangelo '[MASK] peanut allergy . Deangelo then a[MASK]sembles t[MASK]e staff in the " multipurpose room " , including Dwight , who learned from Gabe that Michael did not put in a [MASK]ecommendation a[MASK]d thus snubs Michael . Jim quietly tells Michael that he chose to resign his job and needs to come to terms with both that choice and the fact that life is goin[MASK] to go on at th[MASK] office . Deangelo then step[MASK] out of his meeting and asks Michael for advice for how to run the meeting , saying that [MASK]e 's a good manager and Dunder M[MASK]fflin won 't be the same without him . The two make up with a reverse hug , Deangel[MASK] telling him that he should s[MASK]art enjoying his retirement . Michael returns to his office while Deangelo conducts his meeting in the confere[MASK][MASK]e room . 
 In ano[MASK]her effort to impress [MASK]eangelo , Jim and Pam bring in Cece , to[MASK]which Deangelo reacts positively .[MASK]While they celebrate getting back on his good[MASK]side , Deangelo reveals to the c[MASK]mera that he is in fact indifferent to Cece and was just being polite .

 The epi[MASK]ode was written by co @-@ executive producer Daniel Chun , his fourth writing cre[MASK]it of the series . It was directed by[MASK]then @-@ showrunner Paul Lieberstein , his sixth[MASK]direc[MASK]ing credit of the series[MASK]. The episode marked the first appearance of Wil[MASK] Ferrell 's four @-@ episode arc on the series and is also o[MASK]e of series star[MASK], Carell 's last episodes as [MASK] regular on the series . Ferrell signed on to appear in Steve Ca[MASK]ell 's final t[MASK]ree episodes , and the first episode without Carell , " The Inner Cir[MASK]le " , to make [MASK]arell 's [MASK]ransit[MASK]on easier . Carell had decided to leave the series , because " I just think it 's time ... I want [MASK]o fulfill my contract . When I first signed on I had a contract for seven seasons , and this coming year is[MASK]my seventh . I[MASK]just thought it was time for my character to g[MASK] " .

 " Training Day " received mixed reviews from te[MASK]evision critics . IGN writer Cindy White wrote that Deangelo w[MASK]s not given a proper introduction a[MASK]d that he wasn 't dist[MASK]nguished from Michael 's character . Sh[MASK] [MASK]lso went on to criticize Jim ,[MASK]Pam and Dwight 's reaction to Deangelo[MASK]as th[MASK] new manager , particular that of Jim[MASK]and Pam , writing that " it 's becoming painfully ob[MASK]ious that the longtime writers don 't kn[MASK]w what to do with them anymore " . However , she concluded that[MASK]the episode continued the seventh season 's improvement over the sixth , and that it showed potential for future episodes of the season . She ultimately gave the episode a 7 @.@ 5 out of 10 rating , de[MASK]oting[MASK]a " good " episode . The A.V. Club reviewer Myles McNutt [MASK]raised Mic[MASK]ael 's reactions to[MASK]the office easily ignoring him for Deangelo , ca[MASK]ling[MASK]the final shot of him walking into[MASK]his office alone " quite effective " , and that Dwight 's reaction to not being suggested to be Michael 's replacement made it more " meaningful "[MASK]. Despite this , he continu[MASK]d by saying that the series was not " sophisticate[MASK] [MASK] enough to use this pl[MASK]tline effectively and criticized the writing for the cast , which made th[MASK]m look " s[MASK]upid " for " cheap humor " and a " enormously shallow laughter " [MASK] He ultimately gave the episode a[MASK]" C + " . Alan Sepinwall , a columnist for HitFix , complimented the chemi[MASK]try between Ferrell and C[MASK]rell , but criticized the storyline which eventually came down to Michael " being petulant a[MASK]out not being the center of attention every minute of every day " , negativel[MASK] comparing it to " Viewing Party " . D[MASK]spite this , he not[MASK]d that Ferrell 's presenc[MASK] did involve several[MASK]f[MASK]nny moments . 
 Bonnie Stiernberg , f[MASK]r Paste , was more positive , [MASK]riting [MASK]hat she preferred the use of comedy , following[MASK]the emotiona[MASK] episode , " G[MASK]rage Sale " . She ultim[MASK]tely gave it an 8 @.@ 7 out of 10 . Will Ferrell 's perfor[MASK]ance was especially noted by critics . McNutt compliment[MASK]d Ferrell 's " nuanced " performance , but called his character " uninte[MASK]esting[MASK]" . Stiernberg prai[MASK]ed his dynamic with Carell , comparing it to their prev[MASK]ous rol[MASK]s in Anchorman . His later appearances in the series also received similar mixed r[MASK]views For instance , McNutt called Ferrell 's scenes a " momentum killer " in " Goodbye , Michael " , whereas Rob Sheffield of Rolling Stone called his per[MASK]ormance in the same episode " pure magic " .

 John Crepps Wickliffe Beckham ( August 5 , 1869 – January[MASK]9 , 1940 ) was[MASK]th[MASK] 35th Governor of Kentuc[MASK]y and a United States Senator f[MASK]om Kentucky . He was the state[MASK]'s first popularly el[MASK]cted senator fol[MASK]owing passage of the Seventeenth Amendment . 
 Descended [MASK]rom a prominent politi[MASK]al family , Beckham was chos[MASK]n as Democrat William Goebel 's running mate in the gubernatorial election of 1899 despite the fact that he was not yet of legal age to serve as governor if called to do so . Goebel lost the [MASK]lection to Republican William S. Taylor , but the Kent[MASK]cky General Assembly disputed the election results . During the political wrangling that followed , an unknown as[MASK]assin shot Goebel . A day later the General Assembly invalid[MASK]ted enough votes to give the election to Goebel , who was sworn into offi[MASK]e on his[MASK]deathbed . Taylor claimed the election had been stolen by the Democratic majority in the General Assembly and a legal fight ensu[MASK]d between him and Beckham over the governorship . Beckham ultimately prevail[MASK]d and Taylor fled the state . 
 Following his term as go[MASK]ernor , Beckham made a bid to become a U.S. Senator . His stance in favor of prohibition cost him the votes o[MASK] four legislators in his own party and the seat went to Republi[MASK]an William O. Bradley . Six years later Beckham secured the seat by popular election , but he lost his re @-@ election bid largely because of his pro @-@ temperance views and his opposition to wo[MASK]en 's su[MASK]frage . Though he continued to play an active role in state politics for another two decades , he never returne[MASK] to elected office , failing i[MASK] his gubernatorial bid in 192[MASK] and his senatorial campaign in 1936 . He died in Louisv[MASK]lle on January 9 , 19[MASK]0 . 
 
 = = Early life[MASK]= = 
 
 J. C. W. Beckham was born at Wickland , ne[MASK]r Bardstown in Nelson County , Kent[MASK]cky , son of William Netherton and Julia Tevis ( Wickliffe ) Beckham . His maternal grandfather , Charles A. Wickliffe , was governor of Kentucky from 1839 to 1840 and se[MASK]ved as postmaster g[MASK]neral in the administration [MASK]f John Tyler . His uncle , Robert C. Wickliffe[MASK], served as governor of Louisiana . 
 Beckham obtained his early edu[MASK]ation at Roseland Academy in Bardstown . In 1881 he served as a page in the Kentucky House of Represen[MASK]atives at the age of 12 . Later , he enrolled at Central University ([MASK]now [MASK]astern Kentu[MASK]ky University ) in[MASK]Ri[MASK]hmond , Kentucky but was forced to quit school at the age of 17 to support[MASK]his widowed mother . Two years later , [MASK]e became principal of Bardstown public schools , serving from 1888 to 1893 . Concurrently , he studied law at the U[MASK]iv[MASK]rsity of Kentucky , where he earn[MASK]d his law [MASK]egree in 1889 . He was admitted to the bar , and commenced practice in Bardstown in 1893 . He[MASK]also served as president of the Young Democrats ' Club of Nelson County .

 Beckham 's political career began in 1894 when he was elected without opposition to[MASK]t[MASK]e Kentucky House of Representatives . He served [MASK]our consecutive terms and was S[MASK]eaker of the House in 18[MASK]8 , his final year in the House . He also served as a delegate to every Democratic National Convention from 1900 to 1920 .

 Democrat William Goebel chose Beckham as his running mate in the Kentucky gubernatorial election of 1899 . Goebel was hesitant about the selection becau[MASK]e he wanted someone who could deliver the vote[MASK]of his home county in the general election , and Beckham 's native Nelson County was already committed[MASK]to a rival candidate . But friends of Goebel assured him[MASK]that Beckham would be[MASK]loyal to Goebel 's reform agenda , whereas [MASK][MASK]e two other men Goebel was considering as running mates would " stack the Senate committees against him . " Beckham[MASK]was not yet 30 , the minimum age to serve as go[MASK]ernor , at the time of his selection . 
 Goebel lost a close election to Republican William S. Taylor . When the Genera[MASK] Assembly 's session opened on January 2 , 1900 [MASK] the [MASK]lection results were immediately challenged . With Democrats in control of[MASK]both houses of the A[MASK]sembly , the results see[MASK]ed sure t[MASK] be reversed . The Assembly was still deliberating on January 30 , 1900 , when Goebel was[MASK]shot by an unknown assailant as he entered the state capitol building . The following[MASK]day , as Goebel was being treated for his wounds at a local hotel , [MASK]he General Assembly invalidate[MASK] enough votes to g[MASK]ve h[MASK]m the electio[MASK] . He was sworn [MASK]nto office from his bed the same day . Three days [MASK]ater Goebel died , never having risen from the bed . 
 Legislative chaos ensued as Taylor refused to acknowledge the As[MASK]embly 's decision and vacate the governors[MASK]ip . The Repub[MASK]icans in the legisl[MASK]ture[MASK]obeyed Taylor 's[MASK]orders , while the Democrats ignored Taylor and followed the orders of their lead[MASK]rship . Finally , on February[MASK]21 , 1900 , Taylor and Beckham agreed to let the court[MASK] settle the m[MASK]tter . The case first went before the Louisville Circuit Court , which found in favor of Beckham . Republicans appealed to the Kentucky Court of Appeals , at that time the court of last resort in[MASK]the sta[MASK]e . On April 6 , 1900 , the Court of Appeals upheld the ruling of the lower court . Taylor appealed to the Supreme[MASK]Court of the United States , which declined to hear the[MASK]case on May 21 , [MASK]900 .[MASK]Taylor 's only supporter on the court was Kentuckian John Marshall Harlan . 
 Following the Supreme Court ruling , Taylor fled to Indianapolis , Indiana , fearing he would be implicated in Goebel 's assassi[MASK]atio[MASK] . Beckham became acting governor , but be[MASK]ause of the unusual [MASK]ircumstances surrounding the election , a special election w[MASK]s held November 6 , 1900 , to determine who would complete Goe[MASK]e[MASK] 's unexpired term . Beckham ( now of age ) won the election over Republica[MASK] John W. Yerkes by fewer than 4 @,@ 000 votes . Shortly following the special election , Beckham married Jean Raphael Fuqua of Owensboro . The couple had two sons . 
 As governor Beckham sought to unite his [MASK]arty and the state . As part of[MASK]this effor[MASK] he supported changes to the blatantly partisan [MASK]oebel Election[MASK]Law , authored by his late running mate while the latter [MASK]as a[MASK]member of the General Assembly . He s[MASK]ressed[MASK]non @-@ controversial issues such as improvements to roads and the stat[MASK] 's educationa[MASK] system . He recommended passage of a law to set uniform school textbook pr[MASK]ces , [MASK] reform both he and Goebel had advocated during the gubernatorial campaign . However , his passive leadership ensured that the General Assembly did little[MASK]to address his agenda . T[MASK]e only major pieces of legislation passed during Beckham 's term were a tax increase that [MASK]dded a half million dollars to the st[MASK]te 's revenue and a child labor law that for[MASK]ade c[MASK]ildren under 14 to work without their parents ' consent .

 Although the Kentucky Constitution prohibited governors from serving consecutive terms , Beckham announced[MASK]he would seek a full [MASK]erm as governor[MASK]in 1903 . His candidacy was challenged in court , but the court ruled Beckham had not served a full first term and was eligib[MASK]e to run . Due to his record of reconciliation and supporting non @-@ controversial reforms , h[MASK] had no significant opposition in winning his party 's nominati[MASK]n . His record also deprived his Republican opponent , Morris B. Bel[MASK]nap , of any significant campaign issue in the general election . Beckham defeated Belknap and three minor candidates . 
 In his message to the[MASK]legislature in 1904 [MASK] Beckham again raise[MASK] the issue of a uniform s[MASK]hool textbook law , which had not passed during his first term . The law was one o[MASK] few significant reforms that passed during the 1904 sess[MASK]on . During the session funds were approved for building a new capitol building and a memorial to the late[MASK]Governor Goebel . 
 In March 1904 , Beckham sign[MASK]d the D[MASK]y [MASK]a[MASK] mandating racial segregation of all schools in Kentucky . Berea College , a p[MASK]iv[MASK]te college in ea[MASK]tern Kentucky that had been integrated since the 1850s , immediately filed suit to challenge the law . The sub[MASK]tance of the law was[MASK]upheld in the circuit c[MASK]urt and the Kentucky Court of Appeals . Berea appealed to the Supreme Court , and in 1908 the c[MASK]urt handed down an 8 – [MASK] decision aga[MASK]nst the colle[MASK]e . Only John Marshall[MASK]Harlan dissented . 
 Near the clo[MASK]e of the 1904 ses[MASK]ion , legislators app[MASK]oved the creation of Beckham Co[MASK]nty from parts of Carter , Elliott , and Lewis counties . Olive Hill [MASK]as made the county seat . Soon the county 's existe[MASK]ce was challen[MASK]ed in court on grounds that it fel[MASK] short of the 400 square miles ( 1 @,@ 000 km2 ) required by the state c[MASK]nstitution and that it reduced the counties it was carved from to less than 4[MASK]0 square [MASK]iles ( 1 @,@ 000 km2 ) .[MASK]Carter Cou[MASK]ty joined the lawsuit , claiming the border of Beckham County passed[MASK]too close[MASK]to Grayson , the seat of Carter County , and V[MASK]nceburg , the seat of Lewis County . The state constitution forbade county borders to pass within 10 miles ( 16 km ) of a county seat . On April 29 , 1904 , the Ke[MASK]tucky Cou[MASK]t of Appeals found in favor of the plaintiffs and dissolved Beckham Co[MASK]nty . 
 During the 1906 legislative ses[MASK]ion , Beckham urged investigation and pr[MASK][MASK]ecution of corrupt insurance companies , following th[MASK] lead of New York attorney[MASK]C[MASK]a[MASK]les Evans Hughes . In particular , he recommend[MASK]d reducing the practice of deferred dividends , which allowed the insurance companies to keep large sto[MASK]es of cash on @-@ hand for illegal pu[MASK]poses . He further advocated th[MASK]t i[MASK]surance[MASK]companies d[MASK]ing business in the state be required to invest a certain percentage of the[MASK]r earnings in Kentucky ,[MASK]bolstering the its economy an[MASK] providing policyholders some protection against f[MASK]aud . 
 Beckham [MASK]efused to send troops into the western part of the state to [MASK]uell the ongoing Black Patch Tobac[MASK]o Wars . He cited constitutional reasons for his refu[MASK]al , but more probably his reasons were political – the Democra[MASK]s were dominant in this region and h[MASK] didn 't want to challenge his o[MASK]n [MASK]arty . By collecting some old Civil War debts from the federal government , Beckham virtually eliminated the state 's debt [MASK] Encouraged by the state 's improved finances , the General Assembly voted to expand[MASK][MASK]wo of the state 's normal schools , Wester[MASK] [MASK]tate Teachers College in Bowling Green ( later Western Ke[MASK]tucky Uni[MASK]ersity ) and Eastern State Teacher[MASK] College in Richmond ( later part of Eastern Kentucky University ) . 
 With a s[MASK]ccessful legislative session behind him , B[MASK]ckham made a bold political move in June 1906 : he orchestrated an effort to set the Democratic gubernatorial and senatorial primaries in November – a ful[MASK] year b[MASK]fore the gubernatorial election and two years before the senatorial elect[MASK]on . Beckham wanted the Senate seat , and moving the primary up[MASK]two year[MASK] would allow him to secure his party 's nomination while he was still governor . It also allowed him to use his influence as governor to swa[MASK] the party 's cho[MASK]ce of his potential suc[MASK]essor as governor . State Auditor Samuel Wilb[MASK]r Hager was Beckham 's c[MASK]oice for governor and easily won the ea[MASK]ly prima[MASK]y over challenger N.B. Hays . Former governor James B. McCreary challenged Beckham for th[MASK] senatorial nomination , but Beckham won by more than 11 [MASK],@ 000 votes .

 Beckham 's term as governor ended December 10 , 1907 . In January 1908 he faced the legislature as the Democratic nominee for a seat in the U.S. Senate by virtue of the primar[MASK] held two years earlier [MASK] The Republicans [MASK]ominated fo[MASK]mer governor William O. Bra[MASK]ley . On the first ballot Beckham secured 66 of the needed 69 votes ; Bradley received 64 votes . Seven Democrats had not voted for Beckham . Over the next six weeks , 25 more votes were taken with ne[MASK]ther man secu[MASK]in[MASK] a majority , even though William Jennings Bryan , the Dem[MASK]cratic nominee for president , campaigned for Be[MASK]kham . S[MASK]me Democrats pressured Beckham to withdraw[MASK]and allow a more palatable Demo[MASK]rat to run , but he refu[MASK]ed . On the 29th ballot , taken near the e[MASK]d of February 1908 , Bradley finally secure[MASK] a major[MASK]ty after four Democrats crossed party lines to vote for him . 
 Beckham 's ardent support of prohibition likely cost him the election . His[MASK]position put him at odds with Henry[MASK]Watterson , editor of the powerful Louisville Cou[MASK]ier @-@ Journal . As governor Beckham had crossed t[MASK]e liquor interests and the political machiner[MASK] in Lo[MASK][MASK]sville . When the Kentucky Court of Appeals invalidated the results of Louisville 's municipal elections due to interference by the city 's " whiskey ring [MASK] in May 1907 , Beckham app[MASK]inted Robert Worth Bingham , a young lawyer and fellow prohibitionist , as interim mayor until elections could be held in November . Bingham e[MASK]iminated graft[MASK]ng in the police department ,[MASK]closed gambling houses and enforced blue laws closing saloons on Sunday . Following this , the whiskey ring announced Beckham had [MASK]orfeited the support of Louisville 's legislators . In the senatorial election in 1908 , three of the four Democrats who voted against Beckham were from Louisville .[MASK]Following his defeat , [MASK]eckham returned to his law[MASK]practice . 
 Six years later Beckh[MASK]m again attempted to win [MASK]he Senate seat . Due to the passage of the Seventeenth Amendment , the senator would not be elected by the legislature , but by popular vote [MASK] In the Democratic primary [MASK]eckham defeated Augustus O. Stanley , a 12 @-@ year veteran congressm[MASK]n . The Republican nominee was form[MASK]r [MASK][MASK]vernor Augustus E. Willson . Bolstered by his support of President Woodrow Wilson , Beckham won the el[MASK]ction by 32 @,@ 0[MASK]0 votes . 
 Beckham served as chairman of the Senate Committee on Expenditures in the Department of Labor from 1915 to 1917 and on the Senate Committee on Military Affa[MASK]rs . In the latter position he was influential in securing two large military trainin[MASK] posts for[MASK]Kentucky , Camp Zachary Taylor and Fort Knox . Though Camp Zachary Taylor was abandoned after World War I , Fort[MASK]Knox bec[MASK]me the home of the United States Bullion Depository . When the United States entered World War I , Beckham continued to back President Wilson and supported the League of [MASK]ations . 
 True to his prohibitionist stance , B[MASK]ckham supported passage of the Eighteenth Amendment forbidding the import and sale of alcohol in the United Sta[MASK]es . The amendment was ratified and became effective in January [MASK]920 . Believing women s[MASK]ould be protected from i[MASK]volvement in politics , Beckh[MASK]m opposed the Nineteenth Amendment , which granted women 's suffrage . The amendment fai[MASK]ed on February 10 , 1919 , but passed on June 4 , 1919 . Beckham[MASK]voted against it both times . 
 The Democrats renominat[MASK]d Beckham without opposition in 1920 . His opponent in the general election was Republ[MASK]can Richard P. Ernst . Prohibitio[MASK] had destroyed the distilling industry and the salo[MASK]n business in the sta[MASK]e , and in ar[MASK]as where these industries were prominent Beckham received more than 5 @,@ 000 fewer votes than Democratic presidenti[MASK]l nominee James M. Cox . [MASK]e was also hurt by the women 's vote and[MASK]by his support of President Wilson , who had lost popularity since Beckham 's election in 1914 . Ernst won the election by fewer than 5 @,@ 000 vote[MASK] , winning the race with 50 @.@ 3[MASK]percent of the vote to Be[MASK]kham 's 49 @.@ 7 percent . During his single term in the Senate Beckham served alongsid[MASK] three ot[MASK]er U.S. Senators from Kentucky : Ollie M. James , George[MASK]B. Martin and Augustus O. Stanley .

 Follo[MASK]ing his te[MASK]m in the Sen[MASK]te , Beckham resumed his legal practice in Louisville . He so[MASK]ght another term as go[MASK]ernor in 1927 . This time he ha[MASK] the support of th[MASK] Louisville Courier @[MASK]@ Journal , which had been purc[MASK]ased by his ally , Robert W. Bingham . He was opposed by a powerful political machine known as the Jockey Club , whose main interest was securing legislation to allow parimutuel betting at the state [MASK]s horse [MASK]acetracks . 
 The[MASK]Jockey Club ran a candidate in both parties ' prima[MASK]y elections . In the Democratic primary Beckham defeated the [MASK]lub 's relatively obscure candidate , Robert T. Crowe . Flem D. Sampson , the Club 's nomin[MASK]e in the Republican primary , won his party 's nomination . [MASK]n the general election Beckham could not secure[MASK]the[MASK]support of Democratic governor William J. Fields , who had been elected with the help of the Jockey Club . Despite the Democrats w[MASK]nning every other contest on the ballot , including the r[MASK]ce for l[MASK]eutenant governor , Beckham lo[MASK]t to Sampson by[MASK]more than 32 @,@ 0[MASK]0 votes . It was esti[MASK]ated that the Club spent over $ 500 @,@ 00[MASK] to defeat him . 
[MASK]Beckham was expected to be the Democrats ' nominee for governor in 1935 , but the death of his son in la[MASK]e 1934 left him distraught and his wife opposed to another campaign . The Democrats turned to A. B. " Happy " Chandler of [MASK]enderson , who won the election . Beckham supporte[MASK] Chandler 's b[MASK]d , and in return Chandler appointed him to the K[MASK]ntucky Public Servi[MASK]e Commission i[MASK] 1936 . Beckham also served on t[MASK]e D[MASK]partment of Business Regulations Commission and chaired the State Government Reorganiz[MASK]tion [MASK]ommission . [MASK] Beckham attempted [MASK]o retu[MASK]n to the Senate in[MASK]1936 . The head of the Jockey Club , James B. Brown , had lost his fortune and influence when his banking empire crashed in 1930 . In 1933 Beckham 's ally , Robert Bingham , had been appointed ambassador to the Court of St. James 's , increasing his prominen[MASK]e and influence . Beckham als[MASK] en[MASK]oyed the support of the United Mine Workers and Louisville mayor Neville Miller . The race[MASK]was compli[MASK]ated , though , by the entry of John Y. Brown , a Democ[MASK]at who was a U.S. Representative and former Speaker o[MASK] the Kentucky House of Representatives . He had agreed to support Chandler 's bid for th[MASK] g[MASK]vernorship in exchange for Chandler 's support in his run for the Senate . How[MASK]ver , Chandler threw his support to Beckham , and while Brown[MASK]was not able to win the seat without the support [MASK]f Bingham and Chandler , he did garner 85 @,@ 000 votes , most of them at Beckham 's expense . Democratic incumbent M. M. Logan retained the seat by 2 @,@ 385 votes . 
 Beckham died in Louisville on Janua[MASK]y 9 , 1940 , and was buried in Frankfor[MASK] Cemetery in Frankfort , Kentucky .

 = 1888 – 89 New Zealand Native football team = 
 
 The 1888 – 89 New Zealand Native football team was a New Zealand rugby union team that toured Britain , Ireland , Australia and New Zealand in 1888 and 1889 . It mostly comprised play[MASK]rs of Māori ancestry , and al[MASK]o included some[MASK]Pākehā ( white New Zealanders ) . A wholly private endeavour , the tour was not under the auspices of any [MASK]fficial rugby authority ; it was or[MASK]anised by New Zealand international pla[MASK]er Joseph Warbrick , promoted[MASK]by civil servant Thomas Eyton , and managed by James Scott , a publican . The Natives were the first New Zealand team to perf[MASK]rm a haka , and also the first to wear all black . They played 107 rugby matches during the tour , as well as [MASK] small number of Victorian Rules football and association [MASK]ootbal[MASK] mat[MASK]hes in Australia . Having made a significant impact on the dev[MASK]lopment of New Zealand rugby , the Natives were inducted into the International Rugby[MASK]Board Hall of Fame in 2008 . 
 After a preliminary tour of New Zealand in 1888 , the side travelled to England via [MASK]elbourne an[MASK] Suez . The Māori players initially provo[MASK]ed curiosity due to their race , but the British press subsequently expressed some surprise that the side was not as[MASK]" Māori " as they had expected[MASK]. Playing their first match , on 3 [MASK]ctober against Surr[MASK]y , the team was subjected to a taxing match schedule , and frequently played[MASK]three matches per week . Their early m[MASK]tches includ[MASK]d a 9 – 0 loss to Middlesex , but their form improved in November , when t[MASK]ey won 10 of their 13 matches .[MASK]The team played its first international match on 1 December [MASK] against Ireland , and won 13 – 4 . This was followed by a win over one of the s[MASK]rongest English county teams , Yorkshire , and a 5 [MASK] 0 defeat against the Wales national team . By January 188[MASK] the Natives had played 36 matches in less than three months , winning 2[MASK] of them ; they had spent most of their time in the north of England , where the playing strength[MASK]was strongest a[MASK]d the crowds largest and most profi[MASK]able . 
 In a return match on 19 Ja[MASK]uary , Yorkshire fielded a stronger side than in the first match and inflicted one of the Natives ' heaviest losses , a[MASK]16 – 4 defeat . The tea[MASK] then went undefeated until 16[MASK]Fe[MASK]ruary , when they faced England . Of[MASK]icials [MASK]f the strictly amateur Rugby Football Union ( RFU ) had be[MASK]ome incre[MASK]singly concerned at the behaviour of the N[MASK]w Zealanders , rega[MASK]ding them as unsportsmanlike , and tensions reached a nadi[MASK] in the afterma[MASK]h of the England international , during which the RFU secretary [MASK]eorge Rowland Hill ,[MASK]refereeing the game , award[MASK]d a number of controversial tries to En[MASK]land , prompting [MASK]hree of the Natives to temporarily leave the fi[MASK]ld in pro[MASK]est ; England eventually won 7 – 0 .[MASK]The Natives apologised afterwards for[MASK]their behaviour , but the dam[MASK]ge was not[MASK]repa[MASK]red . The New Zealanders left England wit[MASK]out an of[MASK]icial send @-@ off , and travelled to Australia where they toured Victoria , New South Wales and Queensland . [MASK]hey then returned to New [MASK]ealand , where they displayed a level of combination not seen in their home country before . They went 31 games undefeated before losing their final match , on 24 August 1889 , 7 – 2 to Auckland . 
 The Natives ' final record in rugby matches was 78 wins , 6 draws and 23 losses . They introduced a number of tactical inno[MASK]ations to New Zealand[MASK]rugby on their return home , and their tour contributed to the formation of the New Zealand Rugby Football Union in 1[MASK]92 . Seventeen of the team 's 26 players went on to play provincially in New Zealand , and two , Thomas Elliso[MASK] and D[MASK]vid Gage , subsequently captained the New Zealand national rugby team . 
 
 = = Background = = 
 
 The idea for asse[MASK]bling [MASK] team of Māori footballers to tour Britain was conceived by Joseph Warbric[MASK] , a rugby player who had toured with t[MASK]e first New Zealand national team in 1884 . He initially proposed a team of Māori or part @-@ Māori to play the touring British side in 1888 ; this developed into a ventu[MASK]e to have a Māori te[MASK]m tour Britain if a preliminary tour[MASK]of New Zealand were successful . Hearing of Warbrick 's [MASK]lans , civil servant Thomas Eyton contacted hi[MASK] to offer help manag[MASK]ng the tour , which W[MASK]r[MASK]rick accepted . When James Scott , a publican , subsequen[MASK]ly joined the partnership , the thre[MASK] men decided that War[MASK]rick would be the team 's captain , Scott its manager and Eyton its promot[MASK]r . 
 Warbrick started assembling a team for the tour in ear[MASK]y 1888 . He had difficulti[MASK]s assembling a squad due to player availabi[MASK]ity , and failed to secure the talented Jack Taiaroa due to his university commitm[MASK]nts . Some Māori players who initially agreed to play later pulled out wh[MASK]n the eligibility criteria were relaxed to allow squad members wh[MASK] were only part @-@ Māori . Twenty Māori or part @-@ Māori players joined the squad ; five Pākehā ( white New Zealand [MASK] players were added after [MASK]he team lost to Auckland . Due to the inclusion of these Pākehā players the team was renamed from the " New Zealand Maori " to the " [MASK]ew Zealand Native Football Representatives " . The final squad comprised 26 players ( including Warbrick ) ; of these at least five were full @-@ blooded Māori , while fourteen had a Māori mother and a Pākehā father . The parentage of some of the players is unknown . 
 The team toured New Zealand [MASK]e[MASK]or[MASK] departing overseas , playing [MASK]gain[MASK]t[MASK]Ha[MASK]ke 's Bay [MASK] Auckl[MASK]nd , Nelson , Wellington , Canterbury , South Canterbury , a[MASK]d Otago . The first[MASK]game was contested against Hawke 's Bay in Napier on 23 June 188[MASK] . They played nine g[MASK]mes in their pr[MASK]liminary tour of New Zea[MASK]and , and won seven of them . T[MASK]eir last New Zealand match before departure , against Otago played in Dunedin on 31 July 1888 , [MASK]as won by one try to nil . 
 The team sailed for Australia from Dunedin , leaving on 1 August 1888 . In Melbourne , Scott recruited Jack Lawlor to train the pl[MASK]yers in Vic[MASK]orian [MASK]ules footb[MASK]ll in Britain as preparation for possible [MASK]ictorian [MASK]ules matches on their r[MASK]tur[MASK] to Australia . The team[MASK]played two rugby matches against the Melbourne Rugby U[MASK]ion team , winning the first and drawing the second , before continuing to Britai[MASK] via Suez . They arrived in London on 27 September 1888 .

 The team were met in Britain by local rugby administrators , includin[MASK] an official of[MASK]England 's Rugby Football Union ( RFU ) . The first match of the tour was against Surrey[MASK], where the team became the[MASK]first New Zealand side to perform a haka , and also the first to wear an all black uniform . That the team was predominantly Māori provoked curiosity from the[MASK]British press – at the time , most Britons had not seen non @-@ white people – but [MASK]here was some surprise that the team [MASK]e[MASK]e [MASK]ot as " Māori " as had been expected . " They are not unlike Europeans , " a Scottish reporter wrote in November 1888 ; " that is their resemblance is great when one remember[MASK] that they were a savage tribe no further back than a generation " . The Surrey match , which was refereed by the RFU secretary Georg[MASK] Rowland H[MASK]ll , was won 4 – 1 by the Natives after they scored two tries . 
 The Natives next defeated[MASK]both Northampto[MASK]shire and Kent , before defeats by Moseley and Burto[MASK] @-@ on @-@ Trent . Both defeats were unexpected , and in the Moseley match , injuries played a part – the tourists played most of the match at least two men down , as replacements were then not allowed . The team recov[MASK]red to[MASK]win their next game , against Midlands Counties in Birmingham . Their next fixtur[MASK] was against Middlesex in a match not open to the public , and hosted by the Earl of Sheffield at Sheffield Park , Uckfield . T[MASK]e Middlesex side contained a number of international players , including Arthur Gould . Middlesex won easily , with the Natives play characterised by poor tackling . The final score was 9 – 0 , with three tries[MASK]conc[MASK]ded by the New Zealanders . Prior to the match both si[MASK]es had enjoyed lunch with wine – an indulgence the Natives were not used to . A report[MASK][MASK]n the Auckland Star had this to say of the game : 
 The New Zealanders expected to meet a mere exhibition 15 of scratch players [MASK] whereas Mr Rowland Hill had carefully coll[MASK]cted the best possible team available .[MASK]Such " passing " as the Home men displayed the Maoris frankly admit they have never previously witnessed . Said McCausland whilst we were on the pl[MASK]tfor[MASK] waiting for the London train , " I think [MASK]hey would have just beaten us[MASK], even if we had been in good form . " 
 Following the match against Middlesex , the team tr[MASK]velled to the north , where the strongest En[MASK][MASK]ish rugby teams were base[MASK] . Yorkshire and Lancashire dominated the county championship until many of the[MASK]r respective member clubs split from[MASK]the RFU in 1895 over the issue of " broken t[MASK]me " payments . The New Zealanders lost to Hull 1 – 0 , defeated Dewsbury , then lost to Wak[MASK]field . After their first draw of the tour ( against Northumberland Coun[MASK]y ) they defeated Stockton @-@ on @-@ Tees and Tynemouth . Joe Warbrick appeared in the match against Tynemouth , but[MASK]aggravated the foot injury that [MASK]ad kept him out of the side until that point . These victories were followed by a 13 – 4 defeat to Halifa[MASK] on[MASK]1[MASK] November . Th[MASK] team then won seven matches in a row , including one against Hawick RFC , their only Scottish opposition of the tour . The last two matches that month were a loss[MASK]to Swinton and a 9 – 0 victory over Liverpool and District . The team had played thirteen fixtu[MASK]es during N[MASK]vembe[MASK] and won ten of them . By this point , the[MASK]team was beset by injuries – of the fifteen players that played against Westmorl[MASK]nd C[MASK]unt[MASK] on 24 November , five had injuries . The squad comprised only 26 players , and the tourists were oft[MASK]n struggling to[MASK]field a side . Nevertheless , their heavy schedule continued ; on 30 November 1888 they left for Dublin , where a match had been organised against the Ireland national team . [MASK]

 The Ireland fixture was played at Lansdowne Road , Dublin , on 1 December 1888 . Both teams had a number of leading playe[MASK]s out injured – the Irish were fo[MASK]ced to make four changes to their o[MASK]iginal se[MASK]ection . Ireland led 3 – 0 at [MASK]alf @-@ time after sc[MASK]ring a converted tr[MASK] , but the Natives improve[MASK] considerably in the second @[MASK]@ half , scoring four tries . Patrick Keogh scored the first two tries , and[MASK]his play was praised by the local press . The third try scored was by Thomas[MASK]Ellison after a counter @-@ attack by Geo[MASK]ge Williams . The try was not converted , but the strong finish from the New Zealanders gave the visitors a 13 – 4 victory . The Irish press were surprised by the loss and strongly criticised their team , but Ireland did go on to defeat Wales two tries to nil [MASK]n the 1889 Home Nations Championship . Followin[MASK] their defeat of Ireland[MASK], the Natives played Trinity College and then North of Ireland . The match against Trinity College[MASK]was drawn 4 – 4 , and despite Ke[MASK]gh not playing , the Native side played much [MASK]etter than thei[MASK] previous fixture . The team then travelled to Belfast , where they defeated North of Irelan[MASK] 2 – 0 on 5 December ; scoring two tries to nil . 
 A[MASK]ter returning to England , the Natives [MASK]aced Lancashire in Manchester , where they lost 1 – 0 . Two days later they drew with Batley Bulldogs , despite their opposition scoring five[MASK]tries . Their next[MASK]match was against Yorkshire , who were one of the strongest counties in the coun[MASK]ry , and went on [MASK]o win the inaugura[MASK] County Championship that season . Yorkshire f[MASK]elded a weakened team , a[MASK]d we[MASK]e [MASK]ubsequently defeated 10 – 6 by the Natives , who sc[MASK]red six tries . After a further two victories , the team travelled to Wales , where they lost 3 – 0 to Llanelli , before facing Wa[MASK]es on 22 D[MASK]cember . 
 At the start of the match the home crowd were fairly hostile towards the Welsh team due to fans of both Swansea and Llanelli feeling sli[MASK]hted by the lack of selecti[MASK]n of [MASK]heir players . Four teams dominated Welsh international selection at the time , and out of the 15 @-@ [MASK]an team only William Towers and William Bowen of Swan[MASK]ea and Dan Griffiths of Llane[MASK]li had bee[MASK] selected [MASK] The match was played in Swansea , and the lack of local players may have contributed to a poor crowd , with ga[MASK]e receipts [MASK]f only £ 120 recorded . The crowd '[MASK] [MASK]ostility impacted on the players , and debutant Norman Big[MASK]s[MASK]was " palpably nervous " at the start of the mat[MASK]h . Biggs , aged 18 years and 49 days , became the youngest[MASK]Welsh international p[MASK]ayer – a record he held until the debut[MASK]of Tom Prydie in 2010 . D[MASK]spite the heckles aimed primarily at Biggs , Charlie Arthur and George Thomas , the Welsh team produced an excellent effort , especially from the forwards . 
 Towers scored the first Welsh try , whi[MASK]h was converted by Jim Webb . The Natives replied with a sp[MASK]rited run by Ellison , but he fai[MASK]ed to break through the Welsh defence .[MASK]The tourists trailed even further after George Thomas scored a breaka[MASK]ay try frrm the half @-@ way line , w[MASK]ich went some way to silence the heckles f[MASK]om the crow[MASK] . Webb , playing in out of p[MASK]sition [MASK]t full @-@ back , missed the conversion [MASK]nd then failed at a l[MASK]ng distance goal from a mark . The Natives continued to push , with Elliot coming within five @-@ yards of the tr[MASK] [MASK]ine , and when Ell[MASK]son di[MASK] manage[MASK]to cross the line he was carried back into the 25 @-@ yard line before he could[MASK]tou[MASK]h down . In the second[MASK]half Wales continued to p[MASK]sh their advantage when Alexander Bland dribble[MASK] the ball into the Natives ' 25 ; this was collected by Sydney Nicholls , who managed to get the ball acros[MASK] the t[MASK]y line , allowing Jim Hannan to sc[MASK][MASK]e . War[MASK]rick for the Natives and Stadden for Wales both subsequently came close to scoring tries , but there were no further sco[MASK]es in the game . 
 The match was also of his[MASK]orical importance because of the Welsh tactics employe[MASK] . In the 1886 Home Nations Championsh[MASK]p Wales had trialled the four three @-@ quarter system , wherein the team would play with eight forwards rather than nine , and instead employ an extra centre three @-@ quarter . The sys[MASK]em was deemed a failure and was particularly unpopular with star Welsh player Arthur Gould , whose formidable ability as a back allowed his club team Newport to retain the additional forward . With Gould working in[MASK]the West Indies , Wales again tried the four three @-@ quarter system against the Natives , and its success saw the team permanent[MASK]y adopt the system . Within six years the other three Home Countries had adopted four three @-@ quarter style of play . 
 Before they [MASK]eft Wales , the Natives played Swansea and two other local clubs , [MASK]ewport , and Ca[MASK]diff . They defeated Swansea for th[MASK]ir firs[MASK] win in Wa[MASK]es , and fol[MASK]owed this up with a victory over Newport [MASK]n front of 8 @,@ 000 spectators . They finished their [MASK]elsh matches , [MASK]nd the year , with a 4 – 1 loss to Cardiff in front of a partisan crowd[MASK].

 The side entered 1889 having played 36 matches for 22 wins and three[MASK]draws . The Natives ' play had improved th[MASK]oughout Novemb[MASK]r and December following poorer form in their Oc[MASK]ober matches ; positive press reports reflecte[MASK] this impro[MASK]ement . The[MASK]team would go on to play a further 17 matches before their 16 February international against England . January started w[MASK]th a 4 – 1 loss to Bradford , duri[MASK]g which 25 police officers w[MASK]re required to keep many of the 12 @,@ 000 spectators , many[MASK]of them non @-@ paying , in order . This was followed by victories over Leeds Parish Church , Kirkstall , Brighouse Ran[MASK]ers , and H[MASK]ddersfield . Following[MASK]further matc[MASK]es against Stockport , Cast[MASK]eford , and Warrington , where the team drew , lost , then won , the side faced Yorkshire for[MASK]a[MASK]second time . 
 Yorkshire had been criticised i[MASK] the press for fie[MASK]ding a[MASK]weakened line @-@ up against the Natives when the sides f[MASK]rst met in De[MASK]ember . After the un[MASK]xpected loss , [MASK]orkshire were determined to ma[MASK]e amends and a stro[MASK]g[MASK]side was selected for the county , including Fred Bonsor , Richard Lockwood[MASK]and Joh[MASK] Willie Sutcliffe , all o[MASK] whom would appear [MASK]o[MASK] England against the Natives l[MASK]ter that season . Described as " kno[MASK]ked about " and " stale " , the Natives struggled to compete against such strong opp[MASK]sition , and Yorkshire scored three converted tries before a try to Ellison left the scores at 9 – 1 at half @-@ time . The second @-@ half was little better fo[MASK] the Natives ; they conceded a further two tries as well as [MASK] dro[MASK] @-@ go[MASK]l . The second of these tries was scored b[MASK] Lockwood after he ran the ball from his own half . [MASK]llis[MASK]n s[MASK]ored a converted try late in the match , but this didn 't prevent the Natives suffering their largest defe[MASK]t of the tour : 16 – 4 to the Yorkshiremen . Ellison later described the match as " without a murmur , the biggest beating we received in ou[MASK] whole tour " . 
 After a victory over Spen Valley District , [MASK]he te[MASK]m travelled west to play Somersetshire , Devonshire , Taunton ,[MASK]and Gloucestershire , and won all five games . The vic[MASK]ory[MASK]over Somerset was the New Zeala[MASK][MASK]ers [MASK] largest of the tour ; they scored nine tries in a 17 – 4 victory . Half @-@ back Keo[MASK]h play[MASK]d outsta[MASK]dingly for the Natives , while the entire side demonstrated superior p[MASK]ssing and combination to their opposition . Devon[MASK]hire [MASK]nd Tauton suffered heavy defeats by the New Zealanders , [MASK]efore a strong Gloucestershire side was dismissed . After defeating Midland Counties , the Natives returned to London . 
 The team had two further matches before their international against England . The first was against one of the strongest c[MASK]ubs in England , Blackheath . Andrew Stoddart , who had toured New Zealand and Australia with th[MASK] 1888 British Isles side , played for the club in their 9 – 3 defeat to the Na[MASK]ives . The New Zealanders won having scored four tries , including two by Keogh . Their next[MASK]opposition was a United Services side mainly comprisin[MASK] Royal Navy players . The Natives were again victorious , this time 10 – 0 . The match against Oxford University was [MASK]ostponed due to heavy frost , and so the team had a seven @-@ day break from playing – their longest of the tour . 
 
 = = England international = = 
 
 The match against England was causing the Natives ' players and management problems bef[MASK]re it had even begun . The team manager , Scott , was in dispute with the RFU over where the m[MASK]tch sho[MASK]ld be pla[MASK]ed – the RFU wer[MASK] adamant that the match should take plac[MASK] at Blackheath 's ground , but Scott[MASK]wanted the game to proceed at The Oval , where a larger crowd , and therefore higher gate receipts , could be secured . The strictly ama[MASK]eur RFU establishment were alre[MASK]dy suspicious of the profit[MASK]@-@ making motives of the Natives , and were unwilling to yield on the selection of v[MASK]nue . The RF[MASK] was also in dispute[MASK]with the other Home Unions over the formation of the International [MASK]ugby Footba[MASK]l Boa[MASK]d ( IRFB ) . Following a [MASK]isputed try in an England – Scotland international match in 1888 , the Scottish authoriti[MASK]s had pushed for the establishment of an international body to overse[MASK] the game , but [MASK]he RFU insisted that they would[MASK]only join if they held a deciding vo[MASK]e , arguing that they deserved this as they were , the[MASK] asserted , the [MASK]enior body , and had the most member clubs . Ireland , Wales and S[MASK]otland consequently re[MASK]used to play aga[MASK]nst England until 1891 , when , following a[MASK]bitrat[MASK]on , the RFU relented and joined the[MASK]IRFB [MASK] The absence of international [MASK]atches was a factor in England agreeing to f[MASK]ce the Natives on 16 February 1889 . 
 The line @-@ ups selected for the 16 February match were both s[MASK]rong , and close to full strength . T[MASK][MASK]ugh 12 of the England side had not played internationally before , all were experienced at domestic level . The match was refereed by Rowland Hill , who had also officiated the Natives ' first match in Britain , against Surrey . The opening of th[MASK] first half was a scoreless affair , with much tacklin[MASK] and scrummagin[MASK] on the heavy ground . Later in the half England scored two tries thr[MASK]ug[MASK] Harry Bedford , but both were disput[MASK]d by the Natives , who claimed that one of their players had grounded the[MASK]ball in @-@ goal . England took the two @-@[MASK]try advantage into the second half . 
 Early in the second h[MASK]lf a third disputed tr[MASK] was sc[MASK]red by the English . The try [MASK]nd i[MASK]s af[MASK]ermath caused controversy and a rift between the Natives and the [MASK]FU . Ell[MASK]son [MASK]ttempted to tackle the English player Stod[MASK]a[MASK]t , and in the process ripped his shorts off . The Natives quickly formed a circle around Stoddart to a[MASK]low him to replace his clothing without being seen . While this was happening one of the Eng[MASK]ish players , Frank Evershed ,[MASK]picked[MASK]up the ball and scored a try . The New Zealand[MASK]rs protested , believing that play had stopped after claiming [MASK]toddart had called " dead ball " – but Hill awarded the try , prompting t[MASK]re[MASK] of the Native players , Dick Taiaroa , Williams , and Sherry Wynyard , to [MASK][MASK]ave[MASK]the field in p[MASK]otest . The aggrieved players were eventual[MASK]y pe[MASK]suaded to return , but not before Hill had restarted play . Ellison was very criti[MASK]al of Hill , particularly[MASK]because he was also Secretary of the RFU . Ellison wrote after the tour that " gross as[MASK]these errors were , they were insignificant when compared wi[MASK][MASK] another that Mr Hill commi[MASK]ted at the outset of the ga[MASK]e , viz , refereeing[MASK]at all in that game " . The disputed try was follow[MASK][MASK] by[MASK]a final try for the English , who ultimately[MASK]won [MASK] – 0 . 
 The RFU , at Hill 's instigation , promptly demanded an apolo[MASK]y from the Natives ' captain of the day , Edward McCausla[MASK]d , who had led the team as Joe Warbrick was injured . The English authorities[MASK]of the time believed that the decision of a referee w[MASK]s above question , and that p[MASK]otesting a decision as the New Zealanders had done was unsports[MASK]anlike . The RFU threatened to bar any of their affiliated playe[MASK]s – in other [MASK]o[MASK][MASK]s , the entire rugby playing population of England – from facing the Natives if they did not apologise[MASK]. McCausland sw[MASK]ftly sent an apology[MASK]b[MASK] telegram , bu[MASK] this was deemed inadequate ; he therefore sent anot[MASK]er , four days [MASK]fter the game : 
 The London establishment that governed the game wer[MASK] disturbed by the New Zealander[MASK] ' app[MASK]oach to the game ; reports of rough and over @-@ aggressive play by the Natives had steadily increase[MASK] in frequency since their arrival in Britain . In the nor[MASK]h of England[MASK], criticism [MASK]f the visitors ' sportsmanship was rarer ; the tourists we[MASK]e accepted as playing the [MASK]ame in the same spirit as their loc[MASK]l opponents , which in the north was a more working class sport than in the south . Some of the Natives , including Joe Warbrick , accused the RFU and the Engl[MASK]sh press of hypocrisy , claiming t[MASK]at they were quick to criticise the New Zealanders for rou[MASK]h play , yet tolerant of similar behaviour from their own player[MASK] .

 The Natives remained in Lon[MASK]on following the England in[MASK]ernation[MASK]l . They defeated London Welsh on 18 February , before losing first to Cambridge , then Oxford University[MASK]. From there they travelled north and won two m[MASK]tches before los[MASK]ng to Leigh . After a win over Runcorn , there was a defeat to Oldham , played on a ground Eyton said was so f[MASK]ozen it was dangerous . After reversing their previous loss to Halifax with a 6 – 0 win , the Natives suffered a loss to Barrow and District on 7 March . The New Zealand[MASK]rs then had a run of seven straight wins before a 1 – 1 dr[MASK]w with Hull . Widnes were then [MASK]efe[MASK]t[MASK]d for the second time in two weeks in t[MASK]e tourists ' last match in [MASK]orthern England . 
 The team struggled to find an opponent for their final match in Britain . They event[MASK]ally played Southern Counties , and beat them 3 – 1 . This was their 74th match in the British Isles and their 49th victory . The authorities and press in London [MASK]ontinued to [MASK]iew the team [MASK]egativel[MASK] , and the Natives boarded ship without a formal farewell . This perceived affront from the RFU pr[MASK]vo[MASK]ed some criticism from the press[MASK]outside London , as[MASK]well as from the team manager Scott , w[MASK]o felt[MASK]that with the team 's official apology after[MASK]the England match , the controversy should have put to rest .

[MASK]The majority of the Na[MASK]ives left P[MASK]ymouth on 29 March ( Eyton[MASK]and Pie Wynyard followed a week later ) . They arrived in Melbourne in May , where the team played mostly Victorian Rules football , hoping to make more money that way . Although the[MASK]side had employed Jack Lawlor to coa[MASK]h t[MASK]em in Victo[MASK]ian Rules during t[MASK]eir tour of the British Isles , the heavy schedule and high injury count had left little time and energy for suc[MASK] training . As a result , the Victorian Rules matches w[MASK]re a failure ; the players ' unfam[MASK]liarity with the rules , combined with the fact that most of the Natives were rugby forwards ( and therefore less suited to the [MASK]ore open Victorian Rules ) , ensured that they failed to perform well on the field an[MASK] struggled to attract large crowds . The side p[MASK]ayed nine Victorian Rules matches in t[MASK]tal , including one in Ne[MASK] South Wales , but won only three of[MASK]them , all against relatively weak oppo[MASK]ition . 
 The side 's success in their rugby matches contrasted to their failure in Victorian Rules – the New Zealanders played three rugby matches while in Victoria : against M[MASK]lbourne [MASK] a Navy selection , and Victoria . The matches were all won , with their game against Victoria a 19 – 0 victory . After[MASK]this they left for Sydney for further rugby matches , and defeated New South Wales 12 – 9 . After two furthe[MASK] victories , the side [MASK]gain faced New South Wales , and won the match 16 – 12 . Another two victories follo[MASK]ed , before the team played their on[MASK]y association football matches of the tour – both defeats . 
 The team [MASK]ravelled north to Queensland , where , as in New South Wales , rugby was t[MASK]e dominant code of football . Con[MASK]equently , th[MASK] team exclusively played rugby while in th[MASK] region .[MASK]The Natives faced Queensland at the Association Ground in[MASK]Bri[MASK]bane . The 8000 spectators witnessed the New Zea[MASK]anders overwhelm the Queenslanders to win 22 [MASK] 0 ; the Natives did not exert themselves in the win , and the sc[MASK]re did not reflect their dominance . Af[MASK]er a further[MASK]two matches , against Toowoomba and Ipswich ( both of whom were comfortably defeated ) , the team returned to Brisbane for a rematch [MASK]ith Queenslan[MASK] . In contrast to their first meeting , the fir[MASK]t @-@ half was a close affair , and the two sides were tied at the conclusion[MASK]of the half . Billy Warbrick suffered a ki[MASK]k to the head , and had to retire early in the secon[MASK] @-@ half . Following the los[MASK] of Warbrick , the play of the Natives improved and they recovered to win 11 – 7 . Not long after the gam[MASK] concluded rumours[MASK]circulated [MASK]hat som[MASK] of the players had been offered ₤ 50 by bookmakers to throw the game . Eyton later said : 
 It was on the occasion o[MASK][MASK]this match that four of our players were thought , i[MASK] racing parlance , to be playing " stiff " , and that they had been got by some boo[MASK]ies ;[MASK]at all event[MASK] , when ac[MASK]used of it at half @-@ t[MASK]me and cau[MASK]ioned , they played a different game in the second half . 
 [MASK]he response from the team 's management was to suspen[MASK] four players . The team travelled to Toowoomba , where they defeated the locals 19 – 0 . The Natives included a replacement player for only the second time , Charles Speakman , after the suspensions reduced the playing strength of the side . The team then travelled back to New Zealand , and arrived in Invercargill on 5 August .

 Two days[MASK]after their return , the Natives faced Southl[MASK]nd , who they defeated 5 – 1 in front of a crowd of 2 @,@ 000 . The side suffered further injury , to Harry Lee , and recruited[MASK]Southlander W. Hirst for their match against Mataura District on 8 August . Despite playing the match two players down , the Natives comfortably defeated Mataura 16 – 3 . Following the side 's return to New Z[MASK]a[MASK]and , the Otago Rugby Football Union d[MASK]mand[MASK]d that the team 's management explain the accusations levelled at them in Queensland .[MASK]Eyton responded by insisting that the [MASK]layers had only been suspended while an investiga[MASK]ion was conducted , and that the management was confident no wrongdoing had occurred . The Northern Rugby Union ( since re[MASK]amed Queenslan[MASK] Ru[MASK]by Union ) summarised the [MASK]ncident and aftermath in the 188[MASK] Queensland Rugby Union Annual : 
 ... it was [MASK]pparent to a judge of the game that something was wron[MASK] with the Maori , [MASK]s they were not showing their usual dash and combination . Four [MASK]embers of [MASK]he team were suspended , a charge b[MASK]ing made against them of attempting the sell the ma[MASK]ch . The ma[MASK]ter was bough[MASK] before the Otago[MASK]Union , who p[MASK][MASK]sed the following resolution : That , havin[MASK] heard all available evidence regarding the charges a[MASK]ains[MASK] certain members of the Native Team , and having received an expl[MASK]cit denial of charge[MASK] f[MASK]om the accused membe[MASK]s and a satisfactory ex[MASK]lanation from the management , we are of op[MASK]nion that there are no facts before [MASK]s justifying the allegations ... 
 It is unlikely , given the attitude of the Otag[MASK] Rugby Union to the Natives before their departure [MASK] that they would have dismissed the allegations if incrimina[MASK]i[MASK]g evidence had existed . The side was back to full strength following t[MASK]e return of their suspended players when the side faced Otago in Dunedin [MASK] The Natives outscored their opponents five tries to two , and won 11 – 8 . The side 's star player and h[MASK]lf @-@ b[MASK]ck , Keogh , stayed in Dunedin when the team departed for Christchur[MASK]h . The side faced Hawke 's Bay , who were touring , in Christchurch , and handily defeated them 13 – 2 . The Natives ' play was praised by The Press : " ... the wearers of the black passed with remarkable accuracy and quickne[MASK]s between their[MASK]legs [MASK] over their shoulders , under their arms and with their feet " . The side then faced Canterb[MASK]ry [MASK]n 17 August , who they thrashed 15 – 0 . The report published [MASK]n The Press said of the Natives '[MASK]performance : 
 The play show[MASK]d on Saturday afternoon was a fine exhibition of what several months[MASK]of combination and practice [MASK]ill do ... it must be admitted they were far and away too good for our local men . In the loose , in the scrum , dribbling , [MASK]assing , collaring , or running they were very much indeed Canterbury 's superior . Such runs as were made b[MASK] Warbrick at full back , by[MASK]Madigan , Gage , and W. Wynyard , the passing of H. Wynyar[MASK] , F. Warbrick , and all the backs as well as several forwards , the rushe[MASK] of Alf Warbrick , Maynard , Taare , Taiaroa , and Rene , and[MASK]the dodging and fending powers of nearly every one , non[MASK]lu[MASK]sed their opponents ... 
 The side left Christchurch[MASK]and [MASK]ravelled north [MASK]here [MASK]hey played Wairarapa in Masterton . The match was won 10 – 8 , and the ne[MASK]t day they faced Wellington , who they also defeated . T[MASK]e [MASK]ixt[MASK]re against We[MASK]l[MASK]ngton was nearly abandoned because Scott [MASK]nd the Wellington Rugby U[MASK]ion could not agree on a venue ; the match went ahead only when the Well[MASK]ngton officials agreed to c[MASK]de the Natives all profit fro[MASK] the match . After this the Natives travelled to Auckland where [MASK]hey played their last match , against [MASK]he province on 24 August . The match was lost 7 – 2 after each team scored two tries each , but the Auckland[MASK]rs kicked a drop @-[MASK] goal and a conversion . The loss ended a r[MASK]markable run of match[MASK]s – the Natives had a 31 @-@ game unbeaten streak in rugb[MASK] matches that started with their victory over Widnes on 9 March ; the side won 30 , and drew one match betwe[MASK]n the defeats . 
 
 = = Impact and legacy = = 
 
 Th[MASK] tour had a significant impact on the development of rugby within New Zealand . It was the first tour of the British Isles by a team from the S[MASK]uthern He[MASK]isphere , and the longe[MASK]t in the history of the sport . By the time the Natives retu[MASK]ned to N[MASK]w Zealand , they had developed into a side superior to any in the country , and introduced a number o[MASK] tactical innovations . Seventeen of the 26 playe[MASK]s went on to play provincially in New Zealand , and two[MASK], Ellison and David Gage , subsequently captained New Zealand . 
 The tour also prompted the eventu[MASK]l formation of the New Zealand Rugby Football Union ( NZRFU , later renamed New Zealand Rugby Union ) in 1892 ; one reason for its form[MASK]tio[MASK] was to ensure greater co[MASK]trol over any future tou[MASK]ing New Zealand sides . The NZRF[MASK] sent an officially sanctioned New [MASK]ealand team , captained by Ellison , to tour Australia [MASK]n 1893 . The Natives are also the forefathers of the Māori All[MASK]Blacks , a representative team organised by the[MASK]NZRFU , that first played in 1910 . The[MASK]Native team , along with Joe Warbrick , was inducted into the IRB Hall of F[MASK]me in 2008 – the seventh inductee .

 Éva Gauthier ([MASK]September[MASK]20 , 1885 – December 20 , 1958 ) wa[MASK] a Canadian @-@ American [MASK]ezzo @-@ soprano and voice teacher . She performed and p[MASK]pularised songs by contemporary c[MASK]mposers throughout her career an[MASK] sang in the American premieres of several works by[MASK][MASK]rik Satie , Mau[MASK]ice[MASK]Ravel and I[MASK]or Stravinsky , including th[MASK] title role in the latter 's Perséph[MASK]ne . 
 The niece of Lady Laurier and Sir Wilfrid Laurier , who also were her patron[MASK] , she initially trained and performed in Europe . She then travelled to Java and for four years immersed herself in its native music , which she introduced[MASK]to North American audiences on her return . She retired [MASK]rom performing in 1937 , and opened a voice studio[MASK]in New York , where she became a founding member of the American Guild of Musical Ar[MASK]is[MASK]s and[MASK]served on its board of governors . Gauthier was praised for the many qualities her s[MASK]nging brought to[MASK]music . The [MASK]itation from the Campion Society of Sa[MASK] Fr[MASK]ncisco , which she received i[MASK] 1949 , said : " ... her rare open @[MASK]@ mindedness and u[MASK]o[MASK]thodox e[MASK]thusia[MASK]m having been initially responsible for the recogni[MASK]ion of many vital and important modern composers "

 Born in Ottawa , Ontario , Gauthier received mus[MASK]cal lessons as a child , in ha[MASK]mony , voice , and piano . The[MASK]custom of the time dictated [MASK]hat North America[MASK] musi[MASK]ians travel to [MASK]urope for training if they desired a reputable professional career , and in July 1902 [MASK] at the age of seventeen , Gauthier set out for Europ[MASK] , financed by her aunt and uncle , Lady Zoé Laurier and Sir[MASK]Wilfrid Laurier .[MASK]

 Gauthier travelled to France , where she received [MASK]rivate voice lessons from Auguste @-@ Jean Dubulle of the Paris Conservato[MASK]y . Nodules on her vocal cords were pro[MASK]lematic , but they were removed surgically . She later began training under Jacques Bouhy , whom she would later credit for her vocal technique . In 1906 , Gauthier was retained by fellow Canadian singer Emma Albani to accompany her on a tour of England and her Canadian farewell tour . Albani provided a degre[MASK] o[MASK] mentorship to Gauthier during the 30 week tour of Canada . 
 Lord S[MASK]rathcona awarded Gauthier[MASK]a scholarship in 1906 that allowed her to return to Europe and co[MASK]tinue her vocal studies . She retur[MASK]ed there and continued bot[MASK] to study and give performanc[MASK]s . Her first operatic performance came in 1909 in Pavia , Italy as[MASK]Micaëla in Bizet 's Carmen . She landed a second operatic role as Mallika in Delibes ' Lakmé , which was being performed by the London Covent Garden opera compan[MASK] . The opera opened in June 1910 . Supposed[MASK]y , Luisa Tetrazzini , the prima donna soprano of the company[MASK], feared that Gauthier 's voice would outshine her own , and demand[MASK]d that Gauthier be removed from the opera . The company 's directo[MASK] acquiesced to Tetr[MASK]zzini 's demands , informing Gauthier on opening night that she wo[MASK]ld not be performing . Gauthier reacted badly , and quit opera entirely .

 Disappointe[MASK] by her blocked entry into the operatic scene , Gauthier departed Europe and travelle[MASK] to Java . There , she met a Dutch importer and plantat[MASK]o[MASK] manager[MASK]named Frans Knoote . Gauthier and Knoote married on Ma[MASK] 22 , 1911 . Gauthier studied the m[MASK]sic of Java , and began to include this in her repertoire .[MASK]Her accompanying pianist was Paul Seelig , who had previously been the conductor for the Kraton of Surakarta , which afforded Gauthier a number of oppor[MASK]unities[MASK]. On permission of the Javanese court , she studied th[MASK] gamela[MASK] , probably being the first western wo[MASK]an [MASK]ith a classical music education to be afforded this opportunity . While living in Java , Gauthier travelled extensively , givin[MASK] performances in China , Japan , Singapore , Malaya , Austra[MASK]ia , and New Zealand . [MASK]he remained in Java for four years , but with the outbreak of Wor[MASK]d War I she d[MASK]cid[MASK]d to travel back to North America [MASK] arriving in New York City [MASK]n the fall of 1915 . 
 
 = = = Return to North America = = = 
 
 Arriving in New York , Gauthier struggled to find a niche in an already crowded music scene . She put on a performance in Vaudevil[MASK]e entitled Songmotion ,[MASK]which c[MASK]mbine[MASK] Javan music with dancers . New York was already h[MASK]me to many North American and European musical performers , so G[MASK]uthier focused on her Javan musical repertoire , which she combined with knowledge and skill in modernist western singing . Gauthier began giving annual recitals at Aeolian Hall , and in Novem[MASK]er 1917 her performance there caught the eye of many leading composers . She developed her own reputation quickly , known as[MASK]a " ... sensitive purveyor of interesting , untried songs " [MASK] She[MASK]gave renditions of three songs by Maur[MASK]ce Ravel . Her performance then also included American premieres of Stravinsky 's Three Japanese Lyrics an[MASK] Griffes ' Five Poems of Anc[MASK]ent China and Ja[MASK]an . The performance was a great success , and she began to receive [MASK]nvitations to perform[MASK]premieres of songs by contemporary [MASK]omposers . Stravinsky arranged to have Gauthier to premiere all of his voc[MASK]l piece[MASK] . 
 Ga[MASK]thier travelled to Paris in 1920 at the behest of th[MASK] Music League of America . Sent there to arrange a tour of North America by Maurice Ravel , she struck u[MASK] a friendship and professional correspondence not [MASK]nly with him , but also with Erik Satie and Les six . This led to more music being sent to her by vario[MASK]s composers that she would premiere in concert . She accepted and premiered almost all works sent to her , the only exception being a refusal to perform Pierrot Lu[MASK]aire by Arnold Schoenberg . Thro[MASK]gh this , Gauthier performed larg[MASK] amounts of contempor[MASK]ry Fr[MASK]nch music across the United States . She also in[MASK]luded American music in all of her concerts . Gauthier toured America frequently and returned to Europe in 1922 , and again in 1923 . She began to explore J[MASK]zz music in concert as well , ear[MASK]ing[MASK]her negati[MASK]e re[MASK]iews by many musical critics[MASK]. 
 Her 1923 annual perfo[MASK]mance at Aeolian Hall entitled " Reci[MASK]al of Ancient and Modern Music fo[MASK] Voice " became a historic occasion w[MASK]en she presented the works of George Ge[MASK]shwin , the first time his works were performe[MASK] by a classical singer in concert . T[MASK]e first ha[MASK]f of the programme pre[MASK]ented works considered serious music at the time . She performed both classical works by Vincenzo Bellini and Henry Purcell , mixing them with modernist and neoclassical works by Arnold Schoenberg , Darius Milhaud , Béla Bartók , and Paul Hindemith . The second half of her perf[MASK]rmance would upset the musical establishment , however . She opened with Alexander 's Ragtime Band by Irving Berlin , then [MASK]erformed works by Jerome Kern and Walter Donaldson , and finally finished with three works by George Gershwin : I 'll Build a Stairway to Paradise , Innocent Ingénue Baby , and Swan[MASK]e . Gershwin played the piano for [MASK]hese pieces . Importan[MASK] figures in the audience includ[MASK]d Ernestine Schumann @-@ Heink , Virgil Thomson , and Paul Whiteman . Although some musical critics panned her decision to include Jazz music , the performance was overall a huge success ,[MASK]and provoked serious dis[MASK]ussion among conserv[MASK]tive[MASK]audiences whether jazz mus[MASK]c could be considered[MASK]serious art . 
 Gauthier continued to present music that wa[MASK] thought poorly of by conservative audiences . On so[MASK]e occasions , such as her performances of Gershwin in New[MASK]York in 1923 and 1925[MASK], as well as in London in 1925 , this was quite successful . A critic in Vienna welcomed[MASK]her musical selection as a reprieve from the usual fare of classical performances - Schubert , Brahms , Wolf , Richard Strau[MASK]s - while praising h[MASK]r skill with more classical choices . Other performances suffered [MASK] she was booed while performing works by Heitor Villa @[MASK]@ Lobos at the Festival of the International Society of Contemporary Music in Venice . She became a celebrity , and continued giving performances across the United States , Europe , and her native Canada . On the [MASK]ixtieth anniversary of C[MASK]nadian Confederation in 1927 , she gave a performance in Ottawa which was the first transcontinental radio broadcast in Canada[MASK]. Although she toured Canada from time to time , and [MASK]ttended performances of Canadian music in New York , she held a n[MASK]gative opinion of Canada 's treatment of native musicia[MASK]s , saying " Canadians . . . would rather listen to foreigners than their own people .[MASK]" 
 
 = = = Retirement[MASK]from th[MASK] stage = = = 
 
 Illness fo[MASK][MASK]ed Gauthier to halt giving performa[MASK]ce[MASK] in the late 1920s , but she would return to the stage in 1931 , giv[MASK]ng a c[MASK]ncert in Havana , Cuba . As time passed she began to[MASK]engage more and more[MASK]in teac[MASK]ing , and less and less in stage pe[MASK]forming .[MASK]Her income from teach[MASK]ng was substantial[MASK]y better tha[MASK] from touring . She retired from [MASK]erforming [MASK]ntirely in 1937 [MASK] and opened a music studio in New York . There she became a founding member of the Ame[MASK]ican Guild of Musical Artists[MASK], serving on its board of governors . She died on December 20 , 1958 . 
 
 = = Views of critics and audiences = = 
 [MASK] Gauthier was a controversial musician in her time . Her choice of music for performance was often condemned , and[MASK]often praised . The appropriateness of jazz music for a classically trained singer , combined with the performances taking place in concert halls lead some cr[MASK][MASK][MASK]cs to cheer her for promoting otherwise overlooked m[MASK]sic , and others to condemn her for taking lowbrow music into a highbrow v[MASK]nue . 
 A M[MASK]y 1 , 1917 review by the New York Times praised her natural talent , with some reservati[MASK]ns abou[MASK] the unpolished[MASK]quality of her voice . Her ability to capture the spirit of the pieces was also praised : " ... her singing of songs by Frenchmen of today and the day before yesterday [MASK]ave pleasure because of her under[MASK]tandin[MASK] of them and the a[MASK]propriate expression which she found for them . " 
 A November 12 , 19[MASK]3 Time review of her performance of historic [MASK]talian so[MASK]gs , as well as modern English[MASK], French , Austrian , German and A[MASK]er[MASK]can numbers[MASK]focused on her choice to include selections of[MASK]contemporary jazz music . The critic [MASK]ema[MASK]ked " Her voice was much too good for jazz . " Here she was pra[MASK]sed as a serious , scholarly artist whose perform[MASK]nce was " [MASK].. neat and exp[MASK]essive . " The audience r[MASK]ceived the concert very enthusias[MASK]ically . 
 Her performance in Fargo in 1923 resulted in a headline in the Fargo[MASK]Forum [MASK]he next day that was headed Eva Gauthier[MASK]’ s Program Sets Whole Town Buzzing : Many People Ar[MASK] of Two M[MASK]nds Regarding Jazz Numbers – Some [MASK]eluctantly Admit T[MASK]at They Like Them – Others Keep Silent or Condemn Them .

[MASK]= Battle of Sullivan 's Island = 
 
 The Battle of [MASK]ullivan 's Island or the Battle of Fort Sullivan was fought on June 28 , 1776 , during the A[MASK]erican Revolu[MASK]ionary War . It took place near Charleston , South [MASK]arolina , during the first[MASK]British attempt to captu[MASK]e the c[MASK]ty from A[MASK]erican[MASK]rebels . It is also sometimes referred to as the First Siege of Charleston , owing to a more successful British siege in 1780 . 
 The British [MASK]rganized an expedition in e[MASK]rly 1[MASK]76 for operations in the rebellious southern colonies of Nor[MASK]h America . Delayed by logis[MASK]ical concerns and bad weather , the expe[MASK]ition reac[MASK]ed the coast of North Carolina in May 1776[MASK]. Finding conditions unsuitable fo[MASK] their o[MASK]era[MASK]ions , General Henry Clinton and Adm[MASK]ral[MASK]S[MASK]r Peter Parker decided instead to act against Charleston . Arriving there in early June , troops were landed on Long[MASK]Island , near Sullivan 's Island where Colonel William Moultrie commanded a partially constr[MASK]cted fort , in preparation for a naval bombardment and land assaul[MASK] . General Charles Lee , commanding the southern Continental theater of t[MASK]e war , would provide s[MASK]pervision . 
 The land assault was [MASK]rustrated when the channel between the two islands was found to be too deep to wade , and the American defenses prevented an amphibious landing[MASK]. The naval bombardment had littl[MASK] effect due to the sandy soil and the spongy natur[MASK] of the fort 's palmetto log construction . Careful fire by the defenders wrought sign[MASK]ficant damage on the British fleet , which withdrew afte[MASK] an entire day 's bombardment . The British withdrew their expedition force to New York , and did not return to South Carolina until 1780 . 
 
 = = Background = =[MASK]
 
 When the American Revolutionar[MASK] War broke out in 1775 , the city of Charleston in the colony of South Carolina was a center of commerce in sou[MASK]hern North America . The city 's citizens joined other colonists in opposing the British parliament 's attempts to tax them , an[MASK] militia recruitment increased when word arrived of the April 1775 Battles of Le[MASK]ington and Concord . Throughout 1775 an[MASK] into 1776 [MASK] militia recruits arriv[MASK]d in the city from the colony 's backcountry [MASK] the city 's manufacturers and tradesmen[MASK]began producing war materie[MASK] , and defensive fortifi[MASK]ations began to take shape around [MASK]he city . 
 
 = = = British o[MASK]erations = = = 
 
 British army forces in North America wer[MASK] primarily tied up with the Siege of Boston[MASK]i[MASK] 1775 . Seeking bases of operat[MASK]ons where they had more control , the British planned an expedition to the southern colonies . Major General Henry Clinton , the[MASK] in Bo[MASK]ton , was to travel to Cape Fear , North Carolina ,[MASK]where he would join with largel[MASK] Scottish Loyalists raised in th[MASK] North Carolin[MASK] back[MASK]oun[MASK]ry , and a force of 2 [MASK],@ 000 men from Ireland under the comm[MASK]nd of Major General [MASK]harles Cornwallis . 
 The plan was beset by difficulties from[MASK]the start . The Irish expedition , orig[MASK]nall[MASK] supposed to [MASK]epart at the beginning of December 1775 , was delayed by logisti[MASK]al difficulties , and its 2 @,@ 500 troops did not depart u[MASK]til February 13 , 1776 , escorted by 11 warships under the command of Admiral Sir Peter Parker . Clinton left Boston on January 20 with two companies of light infantry , an[MASK] first stopped at New York City to confer with William Tryon , New York 's royal governor . Ma[MASK]or [MASK]eneral Charles Lee , sent by Major G[MASK]neral George Washington to see to the defense of[MASK]New York , coincidentally arrived there the sam[MASK] day as Clin[MASK]on . New Yo[MASK]k was at that time extremely tense ; Patriot forces were beginning to disarm and[MASK]evict L[MASK]yalists , and the British fleet anchore[MASK] there was having difficulty acquiring provisions[MASK]. Despite this , Clinton made no secret[MASK]that his final target was in the south . Lee observed that this was " certainly a droll [MASK]ay of proceeding ; to communicate his full plan to the enemy is too novel to be credited . " This was not even the first notice of the expedition to the colonists ; a letter intercepted in December had already provided intelligenc[MASK] that the British wer[MASK] planning[MASK]to go to the South . 
 Clinton arrived at Cape Fear on[MASK]March 12 , expecti[MASK]g to find the European convoy already there . He met w[MASK]th the [MASK]oyal governors of North and South Carolina , Josiah Martin and[MASK]William Campbe[MASK]l , and learned that the recruited Scottish Loyalists had been defeated at Moore 's Creek Br[MASK]dge two weeks earlier . Clinton also received pleas [MASK]or assistance from the royal governor of Georgia , James[MASK]Wright ,[MASK]who had been arrested , and th[MASK]n escaped to a navy ship . 
 Parker 's fl[MASK]et had an ext[MASK]emely difficult crossing . Battered by storms and [MASK]igh seas , the [MASK]irst ships of the fle[MASK]t did not arrive at Cape Fear until April 18 [MASK] and Cornwallis did not arrive until May 3 . After several weeks there , in which the British troops raided Pat[MASK]iot properties , Clinton , Cornwallis and[MASK]Parker concluded [MASK]hat Cape Fear was not a suitable base [MASK]or further operations . Parker had sent out some ship[MASK] on scouting exp[MASK]ditions up and down the [MASK]oast , and reports on the part[MASK]ally finished condition of the Charleston defenses were sufficiently promising [MASK]hat the de[MASK]ision was made to go there . 
 
 = = = American defenses = = = 
 
 John Rutledge , recently elected president of the General Assembly that remained as the backbone of South Carolina 's revolutionary government [MASK] organized a defense force under the command of 46 @-@ year @-@ old Colonel William Moultrie , a former [MASK]iliti[MASK]man and Indian fighter . These forces comprised three infantry regiments , two rifle regiments , and a small artillery regiment ; they were augmented by three independent art[MASK]llery companies , and th[MASK] total force numbered ab[MASK]ut 2 @[MASK][MASK][MASK]000 . These forces were further au[MASK]ment[MASK]d by the arrival of Continenta[MASK] regiments fr[MASK]m North Carolina and Virgin[MASK]a ( 1 @,@ 900 troops ) , as well as militia numbering 2 @,@ 700 from Charleston and the surrounding backcountry . 
 Moultrie saw Sullivan 's Island , a sandy spit of land at the entrance to Charleston Harbor extending north ab[MASK]ut 4 miles ( 6 @.@ 4 km ) long and a [MASK]ew hundred yard[MASK] wide , as a place well suited to build a fort that coul[MASK] protect the entrance from intru[MASK]ing enemy warships . A large vessel sailing into Charleston first had to cross Charleston Bar , a series of submerged shoals lying about 8 miles[MASK]( 13 km ) southeast of the city , and then pass by the southern end of Sullivan 's Island as it e[MASK]tered the channel to the inner harbor . Late[MASK] it would also have to pass the northern end of James Island , where Fort Johnson c[MASK]mmanded[MASK]the southeastern approach to t[MASK]e[MASK]city . Mo[MASK]ltrie and his 2nd South Carolina Regiment arrived on Sullivan 's Island in March 1776 , and began[MASK]con[MASK]truction of a fortress to defend[MASK]the island and the channel into Charleston Harbor . The construction moved slowly ; Captain Peter Horry of the Patr[MASK][MASK]t n[MASK]val deta[MASK]hment described the site as " an immense pen 500 feet long , and 16 feet wide , filled [MASK]ith sand to s[MASK]op the shot " . The gun platforms were made of planks two inches thick and fastened with wooden spikes . 
 Congress had appointe[MASK] General L[MASK]e to comman[MASK] the Continental Army troops in the southern colon[MASK]es , and his[MASK]movements by land shadowed those of Clinton 's fle[MASK][MASK] as it sailed [MASK]outh . Lee [MASK]rote from Wilmington on June 1 that the fleet had sailed , but that he did not know whether it was sailing for Virginia or South Carolina . He headed for Charleston , sayin[MASK] " [ I ] confes[MASK] I know not whether I shall go to or from the en[MASK]my . " He arrived in Charleston shortly after the fl[MASK]e[MASK] anchored outside the harbor , and took command of the city 's defenses . He immediately ran into a problem : the Sout[MASK] Carolina troops ( mil[MASK]tia or the colonial regiments ) were not[MASK]on the Con[MASK]inental line , and thus not formally under his authority . Some South Carolina troops resiste[MASK] his instructions , and Rutledge had to intervene by proclaiming Lee in command of all South Caroli[MASK]a f[MASK]rces . 
 Square[MASK]@-@ sh[MASK]ped Fort Sull[MASK]van consisted only of [MASK]he c[MASK]mpleted seaward [MASK]all , with walls[MASK]made from palmetto logs 20 feet ( 6 @.@ 1 m ) hi[MASK]h and [MASK]6 feet ( 4 @.@ 9 m ) wide . The walls were filled with sand , and rose 10 feet ( 3 @.@ 0 m ) above the wooden platfor[MASK]s [MASK]n which the artillery were mo[MASK]nted . A hastily er[MASK]cted palisade of thick planks helped guard the powder magazine a[MASK]d unfinished northern walls . An assortment of 31 can[MASK]on , rang[MASK]ng from 9- and 12 @-@ pounders to a few Briti[MASK]h 18 @-@ pounders and French 26 @-@ pounders ,[MASK]dotted the front and rear walls . Gener[MASK]l Lee , w[MASK]en he had seen its unfinished state , had recommended abandoning the fort , calling i[MASK] a " sl[MASK]ughter pen " . President Rutledge refuse[MASK] , and spe[MASK]ifically ordered Colonel Mou[MASK]trie to " obey [ Lee ] in everything , except in leaving Fort Sullivan " . Moultrie 's delaying tactics so angered Lee that [MASK]e decided on J[MASK]ne[MASK]27 that he would [MASK]eplace Moultrie ;[MASK]the battle began the next day before he could do so . Lee did[MASK]make plans for an orderly retre[MASK]t to Haddrell 's Point[MASK].

 The British fleet wei[MASK]he[MASK] anc[MASK]or at Cape Fear on May 31 , and arrived outside Charleston Harbor the next day . Moult[MASK]ie noticed a British scout boat apparently looking for pos[MASK]ible landing poi[MASK]ts on nearby Long Island ( now known as the Isle of Palms ) , just a few hundred yards from Sullivan 's Island ; troops were consequen[MASK]ly sent to occupy the northern end of Sullivan 's . By June 8 , most of the British fleet had cro[MASK]sed the bar and anchored in Five Fathom Hole , an anchorage between the bar and the harb[MASK]r entrance . With [MASK]he fort on Sullivan 's Island only [MASK]alf complete , Admiral Parker expressed confidence that his warship[MASK] would easily breach its walls . Optimistically believing he would not even need Clinton 's land forces , he wrote to Clinton that after the fort 's guns were knocked out , he would " land seamen and marines ( which I have practiced for the purpose ) under the guns " and that the[MASK] could " keep possession till you send as many troops as you thin[MASK] proper " . 
 The British fleet was co[MASK]posed of nine man @-@ of @[MASK]@ war ships : the flagship 50 @-@ gun Bristol , as well as the 5[MASK] @-@ gun Exper[MASK][MASK]ent and frigates Actaeon , Active , Solebay , Siren , Sphinx , Friendship and the bomb vessel Thunder , in total mounting nearly 300 cannon . The[MASK]army forces in the expedition consisted of the 15th , 28th , 33rd , 37th , 54th , and 57th Regiments of Foot , and part of the 46th . On June 7 , Clinton issued [MASK] proclamation calling on the r[MASK]bel colonists to lay down their arms . However , the inexperienced defenders fired on the boat sent[MASK]to de[MASK]iver it ( which was flying a truce flag ) , and it was not delivered until the next day . That same day , Clinton began landing 2 @,@ 200 troops on Long Isl[MASK]nd . The intent was that these troops would wa[MASK]e across [MASK]he channel ( now k[MASK]own as Breach Inlet ) betwe[MASK]n Long and Sullivan 's , which the British beli[MASK]ved to be suff[MASK]ciently shallow to do so , while the fleet bombarded Fort Sullivan . 
 General Lee responded to the British landing with several actions .[MASK]He began reinforcing positions on [MASK]he mainland in case the British were intending to launch an attack directly on Charleston . He also at[MASK]empted to build a bridge of boats to provide an avenue of retreat for the fort 's [MASK]arrison , but this failed becau[MASK]e there were not enough boats to bridge the ro[MASK]ghly one mile ( 1 @.@ 6 km ) channel separati[MASK]g the island from Charleston ; the unwillingness of M[MASK]ultrie and Rutledge to support the effort may also have played a role . [MASK]he Amer[MASK]cans also constructed an entrenchment at the nor[MASK]hern end of Sullivan 's Island , which was [MASK]anned by more than 7[MASK]0 men and three small cannons , and began to fortify a guard post at H[MASK]ddrell 's Point on the mainland opposite Fort Sullivan . 
 General Clinto[MASK] encountered the first major problem of the attack plan on June 17 . An attempt to wade the[MASK]channel [MASK]etween the two islands established that part of the channel was at least shoulder @-@ deep , too deep for troops to cross even without the prospect of ene[MASK]y oppositi[MASK]n . He considered u[MASK]ing boats to ferry the troops across [MASK] but the America[MASK]s , with[MASK]timely advice from General Lee ,[MASK]adopted a strong defensive position that was virtu[MASK]lly impossibl[MASK] to bombard [MASK]rom ships or th[MASK] Long Island position . As a result[MASK], the British and American forces faced each other across the channel , engaging in occasional and largely inconsequential cannon fire at long range . Clinton reported that this meant that Admiral Parker would have " the glory of being defeated alone . " The attack was o[MASK]iginally planned for J[MASK]ne 24 , but bad weather and contrary wind conditions prompted Parker to call it off for several days . [MASK] 
 = = Batt[MASK]e = = 
 
 On[MASK]the morning of June 28 , Fort Sullivan was defended by Colonel Moult[MASK]ie , commanding th[MASK] 2nd South Carolina Regiment and a company of the 4th South Carolina Artillery , numbering 435 men . A[MASK] around 9 : 00 am that morni[MASK]g , a British ship fired a signal gun indicating all was ready for the attack . Less t[MASK]an an hour later , nine warships had sailed into positi[MASK]ns facing the fort . Thunder and Friendship anchored about 1 @.@ 5 [MASK]iles ( 2 @.@ 4 km ) from the fort while Parker took [MASK]ctive , Bristol , Experimen[MASK] and Solebay to a closer position about 400 yards ( 370 m ) from Sullivan 's Isl[MASK]nd , where they anchored facing broadside to the fort . Each[MASK]of these ships began to fire upon the fort when it reach[MASK]d its position , and the defenders returned the fire . Although many of Thunder 's shots landed in or near the fort , they had little effect ; according to Moultrie , " We had a morass in the middle , that swa[MASK]lowed them up instantly , and those that fell in the s[MASK]nd in and about the fort , were immediately buried " . Thunder 's role in the action was also relatively short @-@ lived ; she had anchored too far away from t[MASK]e fort , and the o[MASK]erloading of her mortars with ex[MASK]ra pow[MASK]er to increase their range [MASK]ventually led to them breaking out of their mounts . Owing [MASK]o shortage of gunpowder , Moultrie 's men were deliberat[MASK] i[MASK] the pace of their gunfire , and only a few officers actually a[MASK]med the [MASK]annons . They also fired[MASK]in small volleys , four cannon at a tim[MASK] . One British observer wrote , " Their fire was surpr[MASK]singly well served " and it was " slow , but decisive indeed ; they were very cool and took care not to fire except their guns were exceedingly well directed . " 
 General Clinton began movements to cross over to the northern end of Sullivan 's Island . [MASK]ssisted by two [MASK]loops of war , [MASK]he flotilla of longboats carrying his troops came un[MASK]er fire f[MASK]om Colone[MASK] William Thomson 's defenses . Facing a with[MASK]ring barrag[MASK] of grape shot and rifle fire , Clinton abandoned the attempt . 
 Around noon t[MASK]e frigates Sphinx , Syren , and Actae[MASK]n w[MASK]re sent on a roundabout route[MASK], avoiding some shoals , to [MASK]ake a position from which[MASK]they could enfilade the fort 's main firing platform [MASK]nd also cover one of the main escape routes from the fort . However , all three ships grounded on an uncharted sandb[MASK]r , and the riggings o[MASK] Actaeon and Sphinx became[MASK]entangled in the process . T[MASK]e British managed to refloat Sphinx and Syren , [MASK]ut Acteon remain[MASK]d groun[MASK]ed , having moved too far onto the s[MASK]bmerged sand[MASK]ar . Consequently , none of these ships reached its intended position , a piece of go[MASK]d fo[MASK]tune not lost on Colonel Moultrie : " Had these three ships effected their p[MASK]rpose , they would have enfiladed us in such a manner , as to have dri[MASK]en us from our guns . " 
 At the fort , Moultrie ordered his men to concentr[MASK]te their fire on the two large man @-@ of @-@ war ships , Bristol and Experiment , which took hit after hit from the fort 's guns . Chain shot fired at Bristol eventually destroyed much of her ri[MASK]ging and severely damaged both the main- and mizzenmasts . One round [MASK]it her quarterdeck , slightly wounding Parker[MASK]in th[MASK] k[MASK]ee and thigh . The shot a[MASK]so tore off part of his britches , leaving his backside exposed . By mid @-@ afternoon , the defenders were running out of gunpowder , and their fire was briefly suspended . Howe[MASK]er , Lee sent more ammunition and gunpowder over from th[MASK] mainland , and the defenders resumed firing at the British ships ; Lee even briefly visited the fort late in the day , telling Colonel Moultrie , " I see you are d[MASK]ing very well here , you have no occasion for me , I will go up to the tow[MASK] again . " Admiral[MASK]Parker eventuall[MASK] sought to destroy the fort 's walls with persistent broadside cannonades .[MASK]This strategy failed due to the spongy nat[MASK]re of the [MASK]almetto wood used in its constructions[MASK]; the structure would quiv[MASK]r , and it absorbed the cannonballs rather than splintering . The exchange continued[MASK]until around 9 :[MASK]00 [MASK]m , w[MASK]en darkness forced a cessation of hostilities , and the fleet finally withdrew out of range . 
 At one point during[MASK]the b[MASK]ttle , the flag Moultrie had desig[MASK]ed and raised over[MASK]the fort was shot down . Sergeant William Jasper reportedly ran to the battlement and raised the flag again , holding it up and rallying the troops until a flag stand could be provided . He was credited by Moultrie with reviving the troops ' spirit[MASK] , and later given c[MASK]mmendations for bravery . A painting of this event ( pictured above ) depicts Jasper 's action[MASK] . 
 Count[MASK]ng casual[MASK]ies , Par[MASK]er reported 40 sa[MASK]lors killed and 71 wounded aboard Bristol , which was hit more than 70 times wi[MASK]h much damage to the hull , yards , and rigging . Experiment [MASK]as also badly damaged with 23 sailors killed and 56 wounded [MASK] Active and Solebay reported 15 ca[MASK]ualties each . The Americans rep[MASK]rted their casualties at only 12 killed and [MASK]5 wounded . The following morning , the British , unable to [MASK]rag the grounded Acteon off the sandbar , set fire to the ship to preve[MASK]t her from falling into enemy hands . Patri[MASK]ts in small boats sailed out[MASK]to the burning ship , fired some of its cannons[MASK]at[MASK]the British ships , took what stores and loot they could , and retreated shortly before the ship 's powder magazine exploded .

 The British did no[MASK][MASK]attempt to take the fort again . Within days of the battle , Charlestonians learned of the signing of [MASK]he Declaration of Independence in Philadelphia . The Br[MASK]tish troops were reembarked on [MASK]heir transports , and on July 21[MASK]the British fleet withdrew nor[MASK]hward to help the main British army in its campaig[MASK] against New Y[MASK]rk City . To a[MASK]d insult t[MASK] injury , one of the British transports grounded off Long Island and was c[MASK]ptured by Patriot forces . 
 The British did not[MASK]return to Charleston until 1780 , when General Clinton successfu[MASK]ly besieged the city and captured an entire army . Until the South again became a focus of the war in late 1778 , its states provided military s[MASK]pplies [MASK]o the northern war effort and produced trade goods that brought in valuable hard currency to fund the war effort . 
 Admiral Parker and General Clinton engaged in a war of wo[MASK]ds after the battle , each seeking to cast the blame on the other for the expedition 's failures . Although Clinton was not blamed by the government [MASK] popular opinion held him responsible , and Parker was lauded for his persona[MASK] bravery .

 Fort Sullivan was renam[MASK]d Fort Moultrie shortly after the batt[MASK]e t[MASK] honor Colonel William Moultrie for his successful defense of the fort and the city of Charleston [MASK] Extensi[MASK]ely modified in the years after t[MASK]e battle , it was supplanted by Fort Su[MASK]t[MASK]r as the principal defense of Charleston prior to the outbreak of the American Civil War . In 1876 , to celebrate the centennial , compani[MASK]s from Savannah , Augusta , Macon , Columbi[MASK] , New York and Boston w[MASK][MASK]e invited to Charleston . The site was turned over to the National Park Service in 1960 , and is now part of Fort Sumter National Monument . 
 A smal[MASK] monumen[MASK] to the Battle of Sullivan 's Isl[MASK]nd has been pla[MASK]ed at the northeastern tip of the island , over[MASK]ooking the inlet where General Clinton 's soldie[MASK]s had h[MASK]ped to cross . The monument includes historical markers describing the events surrounding the engagement . 
 One[MASK]iconic emb[MASK]em of th[MASK] battle was the flag designed[MASK]by Colonel[MASK]Moult[MASK]ie . Commissioned by the c[MASK][MASK]onial government , he designed a blue flag with a white crescent in the top left corner , which was flown at the fort during the battle . Despite being shot down during the siege , it[MASK]was seen as a symbol of this successful defense ( and famously raised during victory ) . It[MASK]came to be known as the Moultrie flag or Liberty Flag . When Charleston ( lost t[MASK] the Bri[MASK]ish in the 1780 siege ) was reclaimed by American forces[MASK]at the end of the war , the flag was returned to the[MASK]city by General Nathanael Greene . 
 
 
 = Hu Zhengyan = 
 
 Hu [MASK]hengyan ( [MASK]hine[MASK]e : 胡正言 ; c . 1584 – 1674 ) was a Chinese artist , printmaker and p[MASK]blisher . He w[MASK]rked in calli[MASK]r[MASK]phy , traditional Chinese p[MASK]inting , and seal @-@ carving , but was primarily a publisher , producing academic texts as well as records of his own work . 
 Hu lived in Nanjing during the transition from th[MASK] Ming dynast[MASK] to the Qing dynasty . A Ming loyalist , he was offered a[MASK]position at the rump court of the Hongguang Emperor , but declined the post , and never held anythi[MASK]g mo[MASK]e than minor political[MASK]office . He did , however , design the Hongguang Emperor 's[MASK]perso[MASK]al seal , and his loyalty to the dynasty was such that he largely retired fro[MASK] society after the emperor 's capture and death in 1645 .[MASK]He own[MASK]d and operated an academic publishing house called the Ten Bamboo Studio , in which he practised various multi @-@ colour printing and embossing techniques , and he employed several members of his f[MASK]mily in this enterprise . Hu 's work at the Ten Bamboo Studio pioneered new [MASK]echniques in colour printmaking , leading to delicate gradations of colour w[MASK]ich w[MASK]re not previously achiev[MASK]bl[MASK] in [MASK]his art form . 
 Hu is bes[MASK] known for his manual of painting entitled The Ten Bamboo Studio Man[MASK]al of Painting and Calligraphy , an artist 's primer which rema[MASK]ned in print for around 200 years . His studio also published seal catalogues , ac[MASK]demic and medical texts , books on poetry , and decorative writing papers . Many of these were edited and prefaced by Hu and his broth[MASK]rs . 
 
 = = Biography = = 
 
 Hu was born in Xiuning Cou[MASK]ty , Anhui Province in 1584 or [MASK]arly 1585 . Both his [MASK]ather and elder brother Zhengxin ( 正心 , art name Wusuo , 無所 ) were physicians , and after he turned 30 he travelle[MASK] with them while they practised medicine in the areas around[MASK]Lu 'an and Huoshan . It is commonly stated that Zhengyan himself wa[MASK] also a doctor , though the earliest sources atte[MASK]ting to this[MASK]occur only in t[MASK]e second half of the 19th century . 
 By 1619 , Hu had moved to Nanjing where he lived with his wife Wu . Their home on Jilongshan ( 雞籠[MASK] , now also known as B[MASK]iji Ge ) ,[MASK]a hill located just wit[MASK]in the northern city wa[MASK]l , served as a meeting @-@ house for like @-@ mi[MASK]ded artists .[MASK]H[MASK] named it the Ten Bamboo [MASK]tudio ( Shizhuz[MASK]a[MASK] , 十竹齋 ) , after the ten bamboo plants that grew in front of the property . It fu[MASK]ctioned as the headquarters for [MASK]is printing business , where he emplo[MASK]ed ten artisans including his two brothers[MASK]Zhen[MASK]xin and Zhengxing ( 正行 , art name Zizhu , 子著 ) and his sons Qipu ( 其樸 ) and Qiyi ( 其毅 , courtesy name 致果 ) . 
 During Hu 's lifetime , the Ming dynasty , which ha[MASK] ruled China for over 250 years , was overthrown and replaced by China 's last imperial dynasty , the Qing . Following the fall of the capital Beijing in 1644 , remnants of the imperial[MASK]family and a few minister[MASK] set up a Ming loyalist regime in N[MASK]njing with Zhu Yousong on the thron[MASK] as the Hong[MASK]uang Emperor .[MASK]Hu , who was noted for his seal @-@ carving and facility with seal script , created a seal for the new Emperor . The court offered him the position of Drafter for the Secretariat[MASK]( zhongshu sheren , 中書舍人 ) as a reward , but [MASK]e did not accept the role ( although he did accord hims[MASK]l[MASK] the title of zh[MASK][MASK]gshu sheren in some of his subsequent persona[MASK] seals ) . 
 According to Wen Ruilin 's Lost[MASK]History of the South ( Nanjiang Yishi , 南疆繹史 ) , prior to the Qing invasion of Nanjing Hu studied at the National University there , and wh[MASK]lst a student was employed by the Ministry of Rites to record official proclamations ; he produced the Imperial Promo[MASK]ion of Minor Learning ( Qin Ban Xiaoxue , 御頒小學 ) and [MASK]he Record of Displa[MASK]ed Loyalty ( Biaozhong Ji , 表忠記 ) as par[MASK] of this work . As a result , he was promoted to the Ministry of Personnel and gained admittance to the Hanlin Academy , but before he could take up this appointment , Beijing had fallen to the Manchu rebellion . Sinc[MASK] contemporaneous biograp[MASK]ies ( Wen 's work was not published [MASK]ntil 1830 ) make no mention of these events , it has been suggested that they were fabricated after Hu 's death . 
 Hu retired from pu[MASK]lic life[MASK]and went into seclusi[MASK]n in 1646 , after the[MASK]end of the Ming dynasty . Xiao Yuncong and Lü Liuliang recorded visiting him dur[MASK]ng his later years , in 1667 and 1673 respectively . He died in poverty [MASK]t the age of 90 , sometime around late 1673 or early 1674 . 
[MASK]
 = = Seal @-@ carving = = 
 
 H[MASK][MASK]Zhengyan was a noted seal @-@ carver , producing personal seals[MASK]for numerous dignitaries . His style was rooted in the classical seal script of the Han dynasty , and he followed the Huizhou school of carving founded by his contemporary He Zhen [MASK] Hu 's calligraphy , although balanced and with a cl[MASK]ar compositional structure , is somewh[MASK]t more angular and rigid than the classical models he fol[MASK]owed . Hu[MASK]zhou seals a[MASK]tempt to impart an ancient , weathered impression , a[MASK]though unlike other Huizhou artists Hu di[MASK] not make a regular practice of artificially aging his s[MASK]als . 
 Hu 's work was known outside his local area[MASK]. Zhou Lianggong , a poet who lived in Nanjing around the same time as Hu and was a noted art connoisseur , stated in his Biography of Seal @-@ Carvers ( Y[MASK]nren Zhuan , 印人傳 ) that Hu " creates miniature stone [MASK]arvings with ancient seal inscriptions for tra[MASK]ellers to fight over and treasure " , implying that his carvings were popular with visitors and t[MASK]avellers passing through Nanjing . 
 In 1644 , Hu took[MASK]it upon himself to create a new Imperial seal for the Hongguang Emperor , which h[MASK] carved after a period of fasting and pr[MASK]yer . He presented his creation with an essay , the Great Exhortation of the Seal ( Dabao Zhen , 大寶印 ) , in which he bemoan[MASK]d the l[MASK]ss of the Chongzhen Emperor[MASK]'s seal and begged Heaven 's favour in restoring it . Hu was concerned that his essay would be overlooked because he had not writt[MASK]n it in the form of rhyming , equ[MASK]lly @-@ footed couplets ( pianti , 駢體 ) used[MASK]in the Imperial examinations , but his submission and[MASK]the seal itself were ne[MASK]e[MASK]theless both accepted by[MASK]the Southern Ming c[MASK]urt . 
 
 = = Ten Bamboo Studio = = 
 
 Despite his reputation as an artist and seal @-@ carver , Hu was primarily a publisher . H[MASK]s publishing ho[MASK]se , the Ten Bamboo Studio , produced reference works on calligraphy , poetry and[MASK]art ; medical textbooks ; books on etymology and pho[MASK]etics ; and copies of as well as commentaries on the Confucian Classics . Unlike o[MASK]her publisher[MASK] in the area , the Te[MASK] Bamboo Studio did not pub[MASK]ish works o[MASK] [MASK]arrative fiction such as plays or novels . This bias towards academia was likely a consequence of the studio 's loc[MASK]tion : the mountain on which Hu took up residence was just to the north of the Nanjing G[MASK]ozijian ( National Academy ) , which provided a captiv[MASK] m[MASK]rket for academic texts . Between 1627 a[MASK]d[MASK]1644 , [MASK]he Ten Bamboo Studio produced over twenty printed books of this kind , aimed at a wealthy , literary audience . The studio 's earlie[MASK]t publications were medical textbooks , the first of which , Tested Prescriptions for Myriad Illnesses ( Wanbing Yanfang , 萬病驗方 ) was published in 1631 and proved popular enough to be reissued [MASK]en years later . Hu 's brother Zhengxin was a medical[MASK]practitioner and appears to have been the author of these books . 
 Durin[MASK][MASK]the 1630s the Ten Bamboo Studio also produced politica[MASK] works extollin[MASK] the rule of the Ming ; these in[MASK]luded the Imperial Ming Record of Loyalty ( Huang Ming Biaozhong Ji , 皇明表忠紀 ) , a biography of l[MASK]yal Ming officials , and th[MASK] Edicts [MASK]f the Imperial Ming ( Huang Ming Zha[MASK]zhi , 皇明詔制 ) , a list of Imperial proclamat[MASK]ons . After the fall of the Ming Dynasty , Hu renamed the studio the Hall Rooted in the Past ([MASK]Digutang , 迪古堂 ) as a sign of his affiliation with the prev[MASK]ous dynasty , althoug[MASK] the Ten Bamboo imprint continued to be used . Despite Hu 's withdrawal from society after 1646 , the studio continued to publish [MASK]ell into the Qing dynasty[MASK], for the most part focussing on seal impression catalogues showcas[MASK]ng Hu 's carving work . 
 The Ming dynasty had seen considerable advancement in the process of colour printing in China . At his studio , Hu Zhengyan experi[MASK]en[MASK]ed with various forms of woodblock printing , creating processes for producing multi @-@ coloured prints and embossed printed designs . As a result , he was able to produce some of China 's first printed publication[MASK] i[MASK] colo[MASK]r , using a block printing technique known as " assorted block printing " ( douban yinshua , 饾板印刷 ) . This system made use of m[MASK]lti[MASK]le blocks ,[MASK]each car[MASK]ed with a different part of the final image and each bearing a dif[MASK]erent c[MASK]lour . It was a lengthy , pai[MASK]staking process , requiring t[MASK]irty to fifty engraved [MASK]rinting blocks and up to [MASK]eventy inkings and impressions to crea[MASK]e[MASK]a single image . Hu also employed a related form of multiple @-@ block printing called " set @-@ block printing " ( taoban yinshua , 套板印刷 ) , which had existed since the [MASK]uan period some 200 years earlier but had only recently come into fashion again . He refined these block[MASK]printing techniques by de[MASK]eloping a process for wiping some of the ink off the blocks before printi[MASK]g ; this enabled h[MASK]m to achieve gradation and modulation[MASK]of shades whi[MASK]h were not previously possible . 
 In some images , Hu employed a blind embossing techni[MASK]ue ( know[MASK] [MASK]s " embossed designs " ( gonghua , 拱花 ) or " embossed blocks " ( gongban , 拱板 ) , using an uninked , imprinted block to stamp designs onto paper . He used this to create white relief effects for clouds and for high[MASK]ights on water or plants . This was a relatively new process , havin[MASK] been invented by Hu 's contemporary Wu Faxia[MASK]g , who was also a Nanjing @-@ based publisher . Wu[MASK]had used this technique for the first time in his book Wist[MASK]ria St[MASK]dio Letter Pap[MASK]r ( Luoxuan Biangu Jianpu , 蘿軒變古箋譜 ) , published in 1626 . Both Hu a[MASK]d Wu used embossing to cre[MASK]te decorat[MASK]ve[MASK]writ[MASK]ng papers , the sale of which provided a sideline i[MASK]come for the Ten Bamboo Studio . 
 
 = = [MASK]ajor works = = 
 
 Hu 's most n[MASK]table work is the Ten Bamboo Studio Manual of Painting and Calligraphy ( Shizhu[MASK]hai Shuhuapu , 十竹齋書畫譜 ) , an anthology of around 320 pr[MASK]nts by ar[MASK]und thirty different artists ( including Hu[MASK]himself ) , published in 1633 . It consists of eight sections , covering calligraphy , bamboo , flowers , rocks , birds and animals , plums , orchids and fruit . Some of these se[MASK]tions ha[MASK] been relea[MASK]ed previously as single volumes . As well as a collection of artworks , it was also intended as an artistic primer , with instructio[MASK]s on correct brush position a[MASK]d technique and several pictures designed for beginners to copy . Although these instructions only appear in the sections on orchids and bamboo , the book still remains the f[MASK]rst example of a categ[MASK]rical and analytic[MASK][MASK] approach to Chinese painting . In this b[MASK]ok , Hu used his multiple @-@ block pri[MASK]ting methods to obtain gradations of colour in the images , rather than obvious outlines or overlaps . The manual is bound in the " butterfly binding " ( hudie zhuang , 蝴蝶裝 ) style , [MASK]hereby whole @-@ foli[MASK] illust[MASK]ations are folded so t[MASK]at each occupies a double @-@[MASK]page spread . Th[MASK]s [MASK]inding style allows the reader to lay the [MASK]ook flat in [MASK]rder to look at a par[MASK]icular image . Cambridge University Library released a com[MASK][MASK]ete digital scan of the manual , including all[MASK]writings and illustrations in August , 2015 . Said Charles Ayl[MASK]er , Head of the Cambridge University Chinese Department , " The binding is so fragile , and the manual so delicate , that until it was digitized , we have never been a[MASK]le to let anyone look through it or study it – despite its undoubted importance to s[MASK]holars . " 
 This volume went on to influence colour printing across[MASK]China [MASK] where it paved the way for the later but b[MASK]tter @-@ known Manual of the Mustard Seed Garden ( Jieziyuan Huazhuan 芥子園畫傳 ) , and also in Japan[MASK], where it was reprinted and foreshadowed the development in ukiyo @-@ e of the colour woodblock[MASK]printing proc[MASK]ss known as nishiki @-@ e 錦絵 . The popularit[MASK] of the Ten Bamboo Studio Manual was such that print run[MASK] continued to be produced all the way through to the late Qing dynasty . 
 Hu also produced the work Ten Bamboo Studio Letter Paper ( Shizhuzhai Jianpu , 十竹齋箋譜 ) , a collection of[MASK]paper samples , whic[MASK] made use of the gonghua stampe[MASK] embossing technique to make the illustrations stand o[MASK]t in relief . Whilst pr[MASK]marily a catalogue of deco[MASK]ative writing papers , it also contained p[MASK]intings of rocks , people , ritual vessels and other sub[MASK]ects . The bo[MASK]k was bound in[MASK]the " wrapped back " ( baobei zhuang , 包背裝 [MASK] style ,[MASK]in wh[MASK]ch[MASK]the folio pages ar[MASK] folded , stacked , and sewn along the open edges . Originally published in 1644 , it was reissued in four volumes between 1934 and 1941 by Zheng Zhenduo and Lu Xun , and revised and republished again in 1952 .

 Other works produced by Hu 's studio included a reprint of Zhou Boqi '[MASK] manual of seal @-@ scrip[MASK] calligraphy ,[MASK]The Six Styles of Calligraphy , Correc[MASK] and Erroneous ( Lius[MASK]u Zheng 'e , 六書正譌 ) and the related Necessary Investigations int[MASK] Calligraphy ( Shufa Bi Ji , 書法必稽 ) , which discussed comm[MASK]n errors in th[MASK] formation of characters . With his brother Zhengxin , Hu edited a new introductory edition of the Confucian classics , entitled The St[MASK]ndardised Te[MASK]t of the Four Books , Identified and Corrected ( Sishu Dingben Bianzheng [MASK] 四書定[MASK]辨正 ) ( 1640 ) , giving the correct formation and pronunciation of the text . A similar approach was taken with th[MASK] Essentials of the Thousand Character C[MASK]assic in Six[MASK]Scripts ( Qianwen Liushu Tongyao , 千文六書統要 ) ( 1663 ) , which Hu compiled with the aid of his calligraphy teacher , Li Den[MASK] . It was published after[MASK]Li 's[MASK]death , partly in homage to him . 
 The three Hu brot[MASK]ers worked together to co[MASK]late a student primer on poetry by their contemporary Ye Tingxiu , wh[MASK]ch was called[MASK]sim[MASK]ly the Discussion of Poetry ( Shi Tan , 詩譚 ) ( 1635 ) . Other works on poetry from the studio included Helpful Principles to the Subtle Workings of Selected Ta[MASK]g Poems ( Leixuan Tang Shi Zhudao Weiji , 類選唐詩助道微機 ) , [MASK]hich was a compilation of several works on poetry and incl[MASK]ded[MASK]colophons by[MASK]Hu Zhengyan himself [MASK] 
 Among the studio 's more obscure publications was[MASK]a text on Chinese dominoes entitled Pai[MASK]ong Fuyu ( 牌統浮玉 ) , written under a pseudonym but [MASK]ith a preface by Hu Zhengyan .

 = Raid on Manila ( 1798 ) = 
 
 The Raid on Manila of January 1798 was a Royal Navy false flag[MASK]milita[MASK]y operation during the Frenc[MASK] Revoluti[MASK]nary Wars intended to scout the st[MASK]ength of the defences of Manila , capital of the Spanish Philippines , capture a Manila galleon and assess the condition of the Spanish Navy squa[MASK]ron maintained in the port . Spain had transfo[MASK]med from an ally[MASK]of Great B[MASK]itain in the War of the First Coalition into an enemy in 1796 . Thus the presence of a po[MASK]erful Spanish squadron at Manila posed a threat to the Chin[MASK] Fle[MASK]t , an annual [MASK]onvoy of East[MASK]Indiaman merchant ships from Macau in Qin[MASK] Dynasty China to Britain , which was of vital economic importanc[MASK] to Britain . So severe was this threat that a major invasion of the Spanish Philippines had been [MASK]lanned from Britis[MASK] India during 1797 , but [MASK]ad been called[MASK]off following the [MASK]reaty[MASK]of Campo For[MASK]io in Eur[MASK]pe and [MASK]he possibility of a major war in India between the British East I[MASK]dia Company and t[MASK]e Kingdom of Mysore . 
 To ensure the safety of the merchant ships gathering at Macau in the winter of 179[MASK][MASK]– 98 , the British commander in the East Indies , Rear @-@ Admiral Peter Rainier , sent a convoy to China escorted by the frigates HMS Sybille and HMS Fox and commanded[MASK]by Captain Edward Cooke . After co[MASK]pleting his mission Cooke decided to [MASK]nvestigate the state of readiness o[MASK] Spanish forces in Manila himself . He was al[MASK]o intrigued[MASK]by reports that a ship carrying treasure was due to sail from Manila , which would make a valuable prize . Sailing in Sybille and accompanied by Captain [MASK]ulteney Malcolm in Fox , Cooke reached the Spanish capital [MASK]n 13 January 1798 . 
 Anchored in Manila Bay , Cooke pretended that his ships were French[MASK]vessels and[MASK]successf[MASK]lly lured successive boatloads of Spanish officials aboard , taking them prisoner in tur[MASK] . Once he had determined from his captives the state of defences in Manila , that the treasure ship had been unloaded at Cavite and that the Spanish squadron was undergoi[MASK]g extensive repairs and thus unavailable for operations , he sent a raiding pa[MASK]ty against a squadron of gun[MASK]oats in the mouth of the Pasig River . Captu[MASK]ing the gunboats in a b[MASK]oodless at[MASK]ack[MASK], Cooke then released his prisoners and sailed southwards , unsuccessfully assaulting Zamboan[MASK]a before return[MASK]ng to Macau .

 In 1796 , after three y[MASK][MASK]rs of the French Revolutionary Wars , Spain and the French Republic signe[MASK] the Treaty of San Ildefonso . The sec[MASK]et terms of this treaty required Spain to renounce its allian[MASK]e with Great Britain and subsequently to declare war on its former ally . In the East Indies this shift of political allegiance me[MASK]nt that the dominant B[MASK]itish forces in the region were face[MASK] with the threat of attack fr[MASK]m the Spanish Philippines to the east . Britain dominated the East Indies in 1796 , controlling the trade routes through the[MASK]Indian Ocean from the ports of Bombay , Madras a[MASK]d[MASK]Calcutta . D[MASK]tch Ceylon , the Dutch Cape Colony and parts of the Dutch [MASK]ast Indies had been captured in 1795 , and the French presence in the region had been confined to Île de France and a few subsidiary islands in the Western Indian Ocean . 
 Some of the most important trade routes began at Canton and Ma[MASK]au [MASK]n Qing Dynasty China . Early in each year a large [MASK]onvoy kno[MASK]n as the[MASK]" Chin[MASK] Fleet " , composed of large East[MASK]Indiaman merchant ships in the employ of the British East India Company , sailed westwards to Euro[MASK]e from Macau laden with tea and other commercial cargo . This convoy was economically s[MASK]g[MASK]ificant to Britain :[MASK]one convoy in 1804 was valued at over £ 8 million ( the equivalen[MASK] of £ 600 @,@ 000 @,@ 000 as of 20[MASK]6 ) . In January [MASK]797 the convoy had been attacked by the French squadron in the East Indies , comprising six frigates commande[MASK] by Contre @-@ amiral Pierre César Charles de Sercey . In the ensuing Bali Strait Incident the commander deceived Sercey into believing th[MASK]t the unescor[MASK]ed convoy contained disguised ships of the line and the French admiral retre[MASK]ted , only learning of his error on his return to Île de France . There was considerable concern in India that Sercey might try again in 179[MASK] , or that the Spanish , who maintained a p[MASK]werful squ[MASK]dron at Cavite [MASK] might make an attempt of [MASK]heir o[MASK]n . 
 Rainier 's initial impulse on [MASK]earning in November 1796 of the impending d[MASK]claration of war between Britain and Spain was to draw [MASK]p plans for[MASK]a major invasion of the Phil[MASK]ppines , centred on M[MASK]nila in repeti[MASK]ion of the successful British [MASK]apture o[MASK] Ma[MASK][MASK]la in 1762 . Co @-@ operating with the Governor @-@ Ge[MASK]eral of India Sir John Shore and Colonel Arthur Welleley among others , a sub[MASK]tantial naval and military forces were earmarke[MASK] for the ope[MASK]at[MASK]on which was in th[MASK] advance planning [MASK]tages , when unexpected news arrived[MASK]in India in August 1797 [MASK]nnouncing the Treaty[MASK][MASK]f Camp[MASK] Formio[MASK]which brought the War of the First Coalition to an end . Britain[MASK]now[MASK]faced Fran[MASK]e and Spain alone , while emissaries from the Tipu Sultan of the Kingdom of Mysore , an old opponent of Britain in So[MASK]thern India , were seeking French ass[MASK]stance wi[MASK]h a renewed outbreak of hostil[MASK]ties .[MASK]The [MASK]esources planned for the operation aga[MASK]nst Manila were therefore retai[MASK]ed in India and the ope[MASK]ation cancelled , but the p[MASK]otectio[MASK] of the China Fleet was still essential and Rainier diverted some of his squa[MASK]ron eastwards to China . 
 A number of merchant ships had gathered at Bombay in the spring of 1797 in preparation for the trip to Macau to loa[MASK] trade goods and join the China Fleet . To escort this force , Rainier provided the 40 @-@ gun frigate HMS [MASK]ybille , captured from the French at the Battle of Mykonos in 1794 , a[MASK]d the 50 @-@ gun HMS Centurion , [MASK]hich sailed with the convoy in July [MASK] taking pas[MASK]age through the Straits o[MASK] Malacca , joined there by the ships of the line HMS Vi[MASK]torious and HMS Trident and the 32 @-@ gun frigate HMS Fox unde[MASK] Captain Pulteney Malcolm for the[MASK]final voy[MASK]ge to Macau . The convoy arrived without incident on 13 December 17[MASK]7 , although the crew[MASK] had been subst[MASK]ntially weakened by tropical illnesses .

 With his convoy safely at [MASK]nchor in Macau and the China Fleet several weeks from sailing , Cooke decided to reconnoitre [MASK]anila and mak[MASK] obse[MASK]vati[MASK]ns on the port and the Spanish squadron[MASK]based there . As an added motivation , rumours in Macau suggested tha[MASK] the annual Manila galleon was du[MASK] to arrive . This ship brought up to two million Spanish silver dollars[MASK]from Acapulco a[MASK]ross the Pacific Oce[MASK]n stopping at Guam on its way to Manila . Depositing its dollars in the Philippines , the ship then loaded trade goods from the East Indies for the return journey to New Spain . This round trip was essential to the maintenance of the Spanish Empire in[MASK]th[MASK] East Indi[MASK]s , which[MASK]operated at an enormous financial lo[MASK]s only mitigated by the substantial subsidy f[MASK]om New S[MASK]ain . S[MASK]anish dollars were the accepted currency across [MASK]ost of the East Indies , and disrup[MASK]ion of this [MASK]inancial system could have profou[MASK]d effects on re[MASK]ional trade ; but British sailors had nevertheless been attacking t[MASK]e Manila galleons since Thomas Cavendish in 1587 . 
 Leaving the heavier w[MASK]rships at Macau , Cooke sailed on 5 January 1798 only with Sybille and Fox , the latter carrying a Mr. Bernard , an experience[MASK] linguist . Passing Luzon , Cooke 's ships encountered[MASK]a small Spanish merchant vessel , which was lured towards the frigates , which [MASK]ere flying French tricolors . [MASK]eizing the Spanish vessel , Cooke closely questioned the [MASK]aptain and [MASK]earned that most of the Spanish squa[MASK]ron in Manila were undergoing extensive repairs at Cavite and were unfit to s[MASK]il . Cooke rewarded the captain by releasing his vessel with its cargo intact , although he did remove 3 @,@ 900 silver dollars . The Spanish squadr[MASK]n had suffere[MASK] badly in a typhoon in April 1797 and much of the damage had still not been repaired by the time Cooke 's small squadron arrived off Manila . Cooke had taken precautions to disguise his s[MASK]ips as French vessels , modelling Sybil[MASK]e o[MASK] th[MASK] powerful 40 @-@ gun Forte and Fox on the smaller Prudente .

 Late in the afternoon of 13 January 1798 , [MASK]ybille and Fox arrived in Manila Bay , slipping unchallenged past the fortress of Corregidor and then sailing across the bay on the [MASK]orning of 14 January , anchoring betwee[MASK] Manila and Cavite . From his vantage point Cooke could see the Spanish squadron disma[MASK]ted and under repair in Cavite , the ships of the line San Pedro , Eur[MASK]pa and Mo[MASK]tañés and the frigates Maria [MASK]e la Cabeya and Luisa [MASK]n dock and unfit for action .[MASK]To[MASK]Cooke 's disappointment he could also see t[MASK]e Manila galleon , Marquesetta being unloaded at the Cavite docks and another valuable merchant ship Rey Carlos aground in the harbour . The Span[MASK]sh had learne[MASK] only shortly before Cooke 's arrival that the British frigate HMS Resistance under Cap[MASK]ain Edward Pakenham was in P[MASK]ilippine wat[MASK]rs and h[MASK]d decided to remove the valuable cargo from the treasure ship rather than risk an attack . 
 Fox was the first British ship into the anchorage , and was consequen[MASK]ly approached by the[MASK]guardb[MASK]at , who[MASK]e crew came aboard [MASK] Malcolm , lik[MASK] [MASK]ooke , spoke French fluently and w[MASK]th Bernard translatin[MASK] was able to[MASK]persuade the officer in charge that the new arrivals were Forte and Prudente seeking supplies and Spanish re[MASK]nforcements for[MASK]commerce raiding operations . The officer offered supplies but cautioned that none of the Spanish ships would be [MASK]n a position to sail until March at the earliest . Cooke [MASK]hen joined the party on the deck of Fox , claiming to be Commodore Latour , a French officer who , [MASK]nknown to the S[MASK]anish , had been killed in the Action of 9 September 1796 off Sumatra . The[MASK]Spanish officer was now completely convinced by the ruse , which h[MASK]d been augmented by fake French uniforms . Inviting the visitor below decks , Cooke the[MASK] passed wine arou[MASK]d and together they drank a series of toasts , includin[MASK] " the do[MASK]nfall of England " . 
 For an hour the officer[MASK] drank , Malcolm and Cooke le[MASK]rning detailed informat[MASK]o[MASK] about the state of the defences and squadron in the Philippines , until a second boat p[MASK]lled alongside Fox containing more officers keen to greet the French arrivals . This vessel was the personal barge of the Spanish commander at Cavite , Rear @-@ Ad[MASK]iral Don Ignacio María de Álava , who was not aboard , [MASK]ut who se[MASK]t a message[MASK]via an aide in a third boat . Eac[MASK] time , the officers were [MASK]scorted below to join the festivities whereupon their crews were[MASK]seized at gunpoint and taken be[MASK]ow decks as prisoners [MASK]f war . In Malcolm 's cabin , the captured officers were informed of their situation , promised release [MASK]efore the British frigates sailed , and offered mo[MASK]e wine . The crew of Fox meanwhil[MASK] forced the captured Spanish sailors to strip and donned the[MASK]r clothing . Climbin[MASK] into the Spanish boats this pa[MASK]ty rowed for the mou[MASK]h of the nearby P[MASK]sig River , where they had learned that three heavy gunboats were moored . Taking the crews b[MASK] surprise , the B[MASK]itis[MASK] boarding parties drove off the Spanish without a fight and brought all thr[MASK]e boa[MASK]s al[MASK]ngside Fox . These[MASK]vessels normally carried crews [MASK]f thirty and were well @-@ armed ,[MASK]one with a 32 @-@ pounder long gun and two with 24 @-@ pounder long guns , each supplemented by four swivel guns . 
 The harbour captain reached Fox shortly afterwards [MASK] furious at the seizure of the gunboats and de[MASK]anding they be returned . Malcolm received him with a tirade of near incomprehensible Fr[MASK]nch[MASK]and brought him to join the other captured officers in his cabin , while [MASK]he boat 's crew were imprisoned below decks . Shortly afterwards , at 16 : 00 , Cooke and Malcolm hosted a large dinner fo[MASK] their officer captives and sent[MASK]food and grog to the crew , the total number of Spanish sailors on Fox now numbering approximately 200 . Once the me[MASK]l was finished , Cooke allowed al[MASK] of the captives to return to their boats and row for shore without the conditions of parole , alth[MASK]ugh he retained the captur[MASK]d gunboats .

 Cooke[MASK]led his small squadron past Corregidor on 15 January and turn[MASK]d south . Four days[MASK]later in a storm one of the gunboats broke its tow line and was neve[MASK] seen again , lost with its twelve crew . The f[MASK]igates subsequ[MASK]ntly scouted Mindanao before reaching Zamboanga on 22 January . There Cooke raised Spanish colo[MASK]rs in an attempt to deceive the authorities into supplying food and water to his squadron but Sybille grounded on a san[MASK]bank at the entrance to the po[MASK]t which raised th[MASK] suspi[MASK]ions of a guardboat sent by the governor of Zamboanga , Raymundo Español . The captain[MASK]of the Spanish boat asked the British ships the names of their captains , an[MASK] on recei[MASK]ing no answer but [MASK] volley of rifle fire , he put the [MASK]own on alert [MASK] With the defenders fore[MASK]arned , Cooke abandoned his ruse and after ref[MASK]oati[MASK]g Sybille the following morning , ordered a bo[MASK]bardment of[MASK]the fort protecting the harbour . This had little effect , though late[MASK] the Spanish recovered at least 450 cannonballs from different calibers , [MASK]nd Malcolm then attempted an amphibious landing in order to stor[MASK] the landward side of the fort . The boats came under heavy fire , one smashed by a cannonball , killing two and wounding four . Another boat gr[MASK]unded on a sandbar and became stuck ; so with his force in [MASK]isarray , as 250 villagers armed with lances ambushed and drove the British from the [MASK]each , Malcolm called off the operation . After ex[MASK]hanging shot for an hour both friga[MASK]es cut their anch[MASK]r cables and retreated out of range , wit[MASK] two de[MASK]d and one w[MASK]unded on Sybille and eight wounded on Fo[MASK] , in addition to [MASK]hose lost i[MASK] the b[MASK]ats . The defender[MASK] lo[MASK]t a single man killed and 4 wounded . 
 With his frigates now requiring[MASK]repairs , Cooke withdraw half a league from Zamboanga and spent three days refitting the masts and rigging of the ships . Then[MASK]he sailed north , scuttling the two remaining gunboats as he did not believe they would survive th[MASK] return journey to Canton . Four days later ,[MASK]on 27 January the squadron halted at a village named " Pullock " in the north of the Sultanate of Maguindanao to collect fresh water . On the beach a boat party from[MASK]Sybille was set upon by Lumad tribesmen [MASK] Two were killed and nine others taken ca[MASK]tive and d[MASK]agged into the forest before rescuers could arrive [MASK] Cooke complained to Sultan Kibab Sahriyal at Kuta Wato and th[MASK] capt[MASK]red sailors were eventually recovered , although not [MASK]efore [MASK]ybill[MASK] and[MASK]Fox had sailed for China to escort the merchant convoy back to India .

 Cooke 's opportunistic diversion had determined that the Spanish forces in the Philippines posed no immediate threat , although the mission had cost 18 lives : Admiral Rainier later expressed his satisfaction with the outcome in a letter to the Admiralty [MASK][MASK]More might have been achieved with reinforcements : Histori[MASK]n C. Northc[MASK][MASK]e Parkinson suggests that had Cooke 's squadron united with Resistance together they may have [MASK]een able to destroy the disarm[MASK]d Spanish warships at Cavite . He also notes however that[MASK]in this scen[MASK]rio P[MASK]ke[MASK]ham would hav[MASK] been commanding officer , a man wit[MASK] considerably less imagination and guile than Cooke . Historian Richard Woodman was criti[MASK]al of[MASK]the mission , cons[MASK]dering the operation to have " no glorious outcome " and citing the failure to capture the treasure[MASK]ships as its greatest[MASK]short @-@ coming . 
 The 1798 China Fleet sailed wi[MASK]hout further incident [MASK] During the ensuing year Resistan[MASK]e was destroyed by an accidental[MASK]explosi[MASK]n in July in the Bangka Strait , a[MASK]d the majority of Rainier 's force[MASK] were focused on disrupting the French occupation of[MASK]Suez in the Red Sea . This diversion of British resources created gaps in the c[MASK]verage in merchant shipping and Ser[MASK]ey was able [MASK]o send the frigate Preneuse and corvette Brûle @-@ Gueule to Mani[MASK]a late in the year to join the repaired Spanish squadro[MASK] . At the beginning of February 1799[MASK], this combined force sailed to Macau , taking the British defences by surprise . The Britis[MASK] commander Capt[MASK]in[MASK]Wil[MASK]iam Hargood counterattack[MASK]d , advancing on the Franco @-[MASK] Spanish force which retreated during the day and disappeared under cover of darkness that evening in the Wanshan Archipelago . The combined squadron then dispersed and the China Fle[MASK]t was not atta[MASK]ked again until the Battle of Pulo Aura in 1804 , at which a French squadron was again driven off [MASK]n confusion . The frigates Cooke had mimicked , Forte and Prudente were sent to operate independently agai[MASK]st British trade in the Indian Ocean in early 1799 . Prudente [MASK]as captured by HMS Daedalus at the Action of 9 February 1799 near Southern Africa , and Forte was intercepted by HMS Sybille under Cooke on 2[MASK] February near Balasore in Bengal . In the ensuin[MASK] ba[MASK]tle Forte was captured but Cooke mortally wounded , dying on[MASK]25 May . 
 
 
 = B of the Bang = 
 
 B of t[MASK]e B[MASK]ng was a sculpture by Thomas Heatherwick next to the City of Manchester Stadium in Manche[MASK][MASK]er , Eng[MASK]and , which was commissioned to mark the 2002 Commonwealth [MASK]ames ; it was one of the talle[MASK]t structures in Manches[MASK]er and the tallest sculpture in the UK until the completion of Aspire in 2008 . It was taller[MASK]and leaned at a greater angle t[MASK]an the Leaning[MASK]Tower of Pisa . The sculptu[MASK]e took its name from a quotation of British sprinter Linford Christie , in which he said that he starte[MASK] his races not merely at the " bang " [MASK]f the starting pistol , but at " the B of the Bang " . 
 The sculpture was commissioned in 2003 ; construction overran and the official unveiling was delayed until 12 January 2005 . Six days before the launch , the sculpture suffered the first of three visible structural problems as the tip of one [MASK]f the spikes detached and fell to the ground . Legal action start[MASK]d a year later , resulting in [MASK]n out @-@ of @-@ court settlement totalling £ 1 @.@ 7 milli[MASK]n . 
 In Februa[MASK]y 2009 , Manchester City Council announ[MASK]ed that the sculpture w[MASK]uld be dismantled and placed in storage . Despite the [MASK]romise of storage and potential reassembly , the core and legs of the sculpt[MASK]re were cut apart during removal . The core was sold for s[MASK]rap in July 2012 , while the 180 spikes remain in [MASK]torage . 
 
 = = Design and statistics = = 
 
 B of the Bang originally stood 56 metres ( 184 ft ) tall with 180 hollow tapered steel columns or spikes radiating from a central core . It was angled at[MASK]30 degrees and supporte[MASK] by five 25 m ( 82 ft ) l[MASK]ng , tapered steel legs which connected to the spikes 22 m[MASK]( 72 ft ) above the ground . The sculpture weighed 165 tonnes , with the concrete in the foundations weig[MASK]ing over 1 @,@ 000 tonnes , including a 400 m2 ( 4 @,@ 300 sq ft ) reinforced concrete slab . The foundati[MASK]ns are 20 m ( 66 ft ) [MASK]eep . 
 The sculpture was made from the same weat[MASK]ering steel ( also known as Cor @-@ Ten ) as the Angel of the North sculpture , which gradually develops a tightly adhering oxide layer as it is exposed to the elements . This layer inhibits f[MASK]rther corrosion by reducing its permeabili[MASK]y to water[MASK]. As part of the des[MASK]gn , the spikes swayed slightly in the wind [MASK]n order t[MASK] withstand gusts in exc[MASK]ss of 100 mph ( 160 km / h ) . At the time of construction a time caps[MASK]le was placed in one of the [MASK]pikes of the sculpture , containing children 's poems and paintings , due to be opened c[MASK]rca 2300 . The[MASK]location of the time capsule after disman[MASK]ling is curren[MASK]ly unknown . 
 B of the Bang[MASK]was located next to the City of Manchester Stadium at Sportcity , in Beswick , at the cor[MASK]er of Alan Turing Way and Ashton New Road ; . It took its name [MASK]rom a quotation of British sprinter Linford Christie in which he said that he started his races not merely at the ' bang ' of the [MASK]tartin[MASK] pistol , but at ' The B of the Bang ' . The artwork had been nicknamed KerPlunk by the locals after the popular child[MASK]en 's game from the 1970s . 
 Prior to[MASK]the construction of Aspire at the University of Nottingh[MASK]m , B of t[MASK]e Bang was Britain 's tallest sculpture at well over twice the height of the Angel of the N[MASK]rth , which stan[MASK]s[MASK]at 66 feet ( 20 m ) . It was designed to look like an exp[MASK]oding firework and was taller and leaned at a greater [MASK]ngle than [MASK]he Leaning Tower of Pisa . It[MASK]was commissioned by[MASK]New East Manchester Limited to commemorate the 2002 Commonwealth Games . The design was selected by a panel consisting of both local residents and art experts via a competition in 2002 and was designed by Thomas Heatherwick .

 The sculpture was constructed in Sheffield [MASK]y Thomas He[MASK]therwick Studio , Packman Lucas , Flint and Neill and Westbury Structures . It was approved at the start of 2003 , with the central core arriving in Manc[MASK]ester on 13 June 2004 . T[MASK]is was the largest load that could be transfe[MASK]red via road from the factory , and required a police escort . This central core was lifted into place in August 2004 , after which the 180[MASK]spikes could begin being attached . Early estimates had [MASK]iven an[MASK]optimistic completion date o[MASK] July 2003 , which contributed to the sculpture gaining the nickname G of the Bang . 
 The off[MASK]cial unveiling by Linford Christie took place[MASK][MASK]n 12 January 2005 . 
 In total the sculpture cost £ 1 @.@ 42 million t[MASK] design and construct — twice the original estimate , as the initial costing had neglected to include installation costs . Funding was sourced from a European Regional Development Fu[MASK]d contribution of £ 700[MASK]@,@ 000 , the North West Develop[MASK]ent Agency[MASK], contributing £ 500[MASK]@,@ 000 , and Manch[MASK]ster City Council providing £ 120 @,@ 000 .

 The tip of one of the 2 @.@ 1 m ( 6 @.@ 9 ft ) spikes detached and fell from the sculpture on 6 January 2005 , only six days before the off[MASK]ci[MASK]l unveiling . [MASK]fter inspection , the event went ahead as planned . 
 Four months later , in May 2005 , a s[MASK]cond spike had to be cut off by firefighters after it was discovered hanging loose . At that time the sculpture was closed off to the public , and the[MASK]junction and pathway near the sculpture were temporarily closed . As a result , some of the j[MASK]ints were re @-@ welded , with[MASK]equipment put in place to prevent excessive movement . This consisted of retrofitting tip weights to 70 % of the spikes ' weights . 
 Despite thes[MASK] modifications , B of the Ba[MASK]g remained fenced off , prompting a local newspaper campaign to ' Get It Sorted ' . In May[MASK]2006 a total of nine spikes were remove[MASK] from the sculpture and taken awa[MASK] for metallurgical[MASK]analysis , to discover the stresses being placed on the steel . 
 It was announced in October 200[MASK] that Manchester City Council [MASK]ere t[MASK]king legal action against the makers [MASK]f the sculpture , with the aim of completing the necessary repairs to the sculpture . In Novembe[MASK] 2008 this[MASK]culmina[MASK]ed in an out @-@ of @-@ court settlement being rea[MASK]hed between Manchester City Council , the project 's desi[MASK]ners Thomas Heat[MASK]erwick Studio Ltd , and the engineering and construction subcontractors Packman Lucas[MASK]L[MASK]d , Flint and Neill Partnership and Westbury Struct[MASK]res Ltd . The agreement was to pay the council £ 1.7m in damage[MASK] for br[MASK]ach of contract and negligence . [MASK]

 Acting on a report [MASK]n January 2009 , the city council recommend[MASK][MASK] that B of the [MASK]ang should[MASK]be dismantled and placed in storage until funds could be raised for its safe reinstatement . [MASK]he report recognised[MASK]the sculpture 's aes[MASK]hetic value for Manchester an[MASK] Manchester City Council committed itself to working with the artist to reach a l[MASK]ng @-@ term solution . One [MASK]os[MASK]ibility involved the repla[MASK]ement of the steel spikes with altern[MASK]tives made from carbon fibre , although the report underlined th[MASK] necessity for e[MASK]tensive testing . 
 In January 2009 , Antony Gormley , creator of the Angel of the North [MASK] to which B of the Bang is often compared — spoke out in support of the sculp[MASK]ure , stating that , " It is a gr[MASK]at tribute to Manchester that this ground @-@ [MASK]reaking work was commissioned . To allow it to disappear would be a loss not just of an inspirational artwork but also of the council 's nerve . " 
 Despite Gormle[MASK] 's plea , removal of B of the Bang [MASK]e[MASK]an in April 2009 . More substantial hoarding was erected arou[MASK]d the site and demolition firm Connell [MASK]rothers Limited began removing the spikes with oxyacetylene cutting equipment . 
 Although the council[MASK]had promised to store the complex central[MASK]core and legs , these too were cut apart during removal , casting doubt on future prospects for the landmark sculpture 's return[MASK], and in ea[MASK]ly July 2012 the core was sold a[MASK] scrap for £ 17 @,@ 000 .

 The Battle [MASK]f the Hongorai River took place duri[MASK][MASK] the Second World War and involved Au[MASK]tralian[MASK], New Zealand and Japa[MASK]ese forces . Part of the wider Boug[MASK]inville Campaign of the Pacific[MASK]theatre , the battle [MASK]as fought[MASK]in the southern sector of Bougainville[MASK]Island . Coming after the Battle of [MASK]later 's Knoll[MASK]in which a strong Japanes[MASK] counterattack was defeated , the battle occurred in two distinct[MASK]periods between 17 April and 22 May 1945 , as elemen[MASK]s of the Australian 15th Brigade advanced south along the Buin Road . 
 The initial phase saw the Australians advance towards the Hongorai River . Fol[MASK]owing the end of the early fighting , the Austra[MASK]ian advance towards the main Japanese co[MASK]centration[MASK]at Buin continued as they stru[MASK]k out towards the Hari and Mivo Rivers . This continued until torrential rain and flooding brought the[MASK]advance to a halt s[MASK]ort of the[MASK]objective , washing away many bridges and roads upon which the Australians relied for supplies . As the Australian advance stalled , the Japanese began harassing the Australian line of communications , and as t[MASK]e rain stopped and the flooding subsided in late @-@ July and into August , the Australians began making preparations to resume the advance[MASK]towa[MASK]ds Buin again . Ultimately , though , the war came to an end before the final Australian advance began , bringing the[MASK]campaign to an [MASK]n[MASK] .

 Japanese forces had landed on Bougainville in early 1942 , captu[MASK][MASK][MASK]g it from the small force of Aus[MASK]ralians garrisoning the island . They had subsequently developed several airbases on the i[MASK]land[MASK], using it to [MASK]onduct operations in the northern Solomon I[MASK]l[MASK]nds and to attack the Allied lines of communication between the United States , Australia and the Southwest Paci[MASK]ic Area . Th[MASK]se bases also helped protect Rabaul , the major Japanese garrison and naval base in Papua New Guinea , and th[MASK]oughout 1943 , Allied planners determined that Bougainville was vital for neutralising the Japanese base around Rabaul . 
 US Marines [MASK]onducte[MASK] an amp[MASK]ibious landin[MASK] at Cape[MASK]Torokina , on the western c[MASK]ast of [MASK]he island , north of Empress Augusta Bay , in November 1943 . After an initial cou[MASK]ter @-@ attack , the US Marines had been repla[MASK]ed by a garrison of US Army troops who began con[MASK]olidating their position arou[MASK]d Torokina , establishing a strong perimete[MASK] . In March 1944 , the Japanese launched [MASK] heavy counter @-@ attack , which was turned[MASK]back with heavy casualties . After this , the situation on Bougainv[MASK]lle became largely static , as the Japanese [MASK]ocused primarily on s[MASK]bsistence , and the US forces chose to adopt a mainly defensive postu[MASK]e focused on main[MASK]aining the perimeter around Torokina . 
 In late [MASK]944 , as [MASK]art of plans to free US troops up for the [MASK]hilippines campaign , the Australian II Corps — c[MASK]nsisting of mainly Militi[MASK] troops under the command of Lieutenant General Stanley Savige — took over[MASK]responsibility fo[MASK] [MASK]llied operatio[MASK]s on Bougainville from the American XIV Corps . Australian forces began arriving[MASK]on the island between November and December 1944 ,[MASK]initially establishing themselves around the US base at Torok[MASK]na . Due to[MASK]inaccurate intelligence , Savige mistakenly believed that the Japanese forces on the island numbered just 17 @,@ 500 men , and he consequently decided that the Australians would pursue an aggressive campaign to clear the Japanese from Bougainville in order to fr[MASK]e their troops for subsequent operations elsewhere ,[MASK]rather than maintaining t[MASK]e defensive[MASK]post[MASK]re the US forces had [MASK]dopted . However , Allied estimates of Japanese strength were l[MASK]ter found t[MASK] be grossly inaccurate a[MASK]d a[MASK]ter the war it was found that the number of Japanese on the island at this time was closer to 40 @,@ 000 . 
 The campaign that Austr[MASK][MASK]ian planners developed entailed thre[MASK] separate drives : in the north , it was planned that Japanese f[MASK]rces would be forced into [MASK]he narrow Bonis Peninsula and con[MASK]ained ; in the centre the seizure of Pearl Rid[MASK]e would give the Australians control of the east – west avenues of approach , as well as affording them prote[MASK]tion against further coun[MASK]er @-@ attac[MASK]s , while also opening the way for a drive to the east coast ; and the main campa[MASK]gn in the south , where the bulk of the Japanese forces were concentrated around Buin[MASK].

 Following the capture of Pearl Ridge in December 1944 , the[MASK]Australian 7th Brigade had been moved south and al[MASK]ocated to the drive towards Buin . In[MASK]late March a[MASK]d early April 1945 , they had fought the Battle of Slater 's Knoll after which a brief lull followed as the Australians paused to shorten their supply lines . Meanwhile ,[MASK]the survivors of the Japanese force , heavily demoralise[MASK] by [MASK]heir defeat , withdrew towards the Hongo[MASK]ai River . The Australian 3rd Division was then ordered to resume its a[MASK]vance sou[MASK]h , being tasked with capturing the Hari River , while the Hongorai [MASK]as also included as an " in[MASK]ermediate objective " . Japanese stren[MASK]th[MASK]in the southern sector was estimat[MASK]d by the Australians at about 10 @,@ 500 men , of which 2 @,@ 300 were beli[MASK]ved to be[MASK]directly opposing t[MASK]e 3rd Division . The 15th Brigade was considered to be the m[MASK]st experienced of the Australian units on Bougainville at the time and was moved [MASK]p to relieve the 7th [MASK]rigade , which was in need of rest . 
 Under the command of Brigadier Heathcote Hammer the 15th Brigade consisted of t[MASK]ree infantry battalion[MASK] as well as two troops of tanks from the 2 / 4th Armoured Regiment , engineer[MASK] from the 15th Field Company , a battery of 155 @-@ mm guns from ' U ' Heavy Battery , field artillery from the 2nd Field Regiment , and a number of smaller support units . The 58th / 59th Infantry Battalion took over responsibility for Slater [MASK]s Knoll replacing the 25th Infantry Battalion while the 24th Infantry Battalion took [MASK]p a position across the Buin Road . The brigade 's third battalion — [MASK]he 57th / 60th Infantry Battalion — did not join them until the beginning of May , and so the 7th Brigade 's 9th Infantry Battalion continued patrolling operations north of the Huio River , in the Rumiki area , until the 57th / 60th could dispatch[MASK]elements to relieve [MASK]h[MASK]m . Further inland , the 2 / 8th Commando Squa[MASK]ron advanced in a wide arc to the s[MASK]uth @-@ east [MASK] defending th[MASK] brigade[MASK]'s left , or eastern , flank . 
 The Japanese forces opposing the Australians belonged to the 6th Division , under the command of Lieutenant General Tsutomu Akinaga . Akinaga had been ordered to dela[MASK] the Australian advance between the Hongorai and the Hari for as long as possible , and with th[MASK]se orders in m[MASK]nd he had installed a nu[MASK]ber of stron[MASK] points along the Australian 's expected line of advance . The division 's infantry had suffered heavily in the previous battle [MASK]roun[MASK] Slater 's Knoll and as a consequence [MASK] several units had to be reorganized or amal[MASK]amated . The front line [MASK]ositions were assigned to the 6th Field Artillery Regiment , while the 13th Infantry Regiment was to[MASK]hold five strongpoints to their rear along [MASK]nd astride the Buin Road , designated ' A ' th[MASK]ough to ' E ' . The 6th Field and 4th Field Heavy Artillery Regi[MASK]ents both held strongpoints further back , designated ' F ' and ' G ' . [MASK]he 23rd Infantry Regiment was placed in the rear , where it [MASK]as [MASK]eing re[MASK]onstituted following losses suffered during the attack on Slater 's Knoll .

 The 15th Brigade took over the forward pos[MASK]tions from the 7th Briga[MASK]e on 17 April . Initial dispositions had the 24th Infantry Battalion on t[MASK]e Buin Road around Kero Creek , with the 58th / 59th around Barara , [MASK]orth @-@ eas[MASK] of Slater 's Knol[MASK] , and the 57th / 60th , when it arrived to relieve the 9th , would be positioned further east astride a seco[MASK]dary [MASK] parallel track known to the Australians a[MASK] the Commando Road . Two days later[MASK], Hammer received the order to commence the advance towards the Hongor[MASK]i from Sa[MASK]ige , who offered him the support of the 29th Brigade as a mobile reserve in case of sudden count[MASK]r @-@ attack . In a change to the tac[MASK]ics th[MASK]t the[MASK]Australians had pr[MASK]viously employed prior to the fighting around Slater 's Knoll , from early May they advanced on a two @-@ battalion front , instead of one . The 24th Infantry Battalion was in the van , moving along the Buin Road with the 58th / 59th protecting its flank and[MASK]rear ; while 5 [MASK],@ 000 yd ( 4 @,@[MASK]600 m ) further inland the[MASK]57th / 60th Infantry Battalion[MASK], com[MASK]encing on 3 May , advanced along the Commando Road from Rumiki , after t[MASK]king over from the 9th Infantry Battalion . 
 Moving forward under a creeping barrage as they moved beyond Tokinotu , the 24th Infantry Battalion was the first to contact the Japanese , carrying out an attack against Japanese positions around Dawe 's Creek on 17 April . Sup[MASK]orted by a troop of Matilda tanks from the 2 / 4th Armoured Regiment , an artillery barrage which fired over 700 shells , two infantry companies — ' C ' and ' D ' — from the 24th attacked the position while another — ' A ' Compa[MASK]y — carried out a flanking manoeuvre to cut another tra[MASK]k further north towards Kindara and Hat[MASK]i . The left forward company — '[MASK]D ' Company — reached it[MASK] objective without trouble[MASK]; however , ' C ' Company — on the right along [MASK]ith the troop o[MASK] tanks — came up against stiff Japanese resistance and became bogged down[MASK]. ' A ' Company also became embroiled in heavy fighting along the Hatai track . In support of ' A ' Company , Mat[MASK]lidas came forward and raked the jungle , hacking through the undergrowth to reveal several Japanese pillboxes , which were destroyed by the Australian armour . As nigh[MASK] fell , ' C ' Company dug in before resuming the attack the next morning[MASK]. Engineers were brought forward , as was a bulldozer , and the ga[MASK] was bridged . Amidst heavy fighting , the Australians forced their way across the creek . By the time that the p[MASK]sition had been taken in the afternoon and the infantry had advanc[MASK]d to the line of exploitation 400 yd [MASK] 370 m ) beyond the creek , 37 Japanese had been[MASK]kil[MASK]ed for the loss o[MASK] seven Australians killed and 19 wounded . After [MASK]his , the Austral[MASK]ans continued thei[MASK] advance towards S[MASK]ndou Creek , which was a further 1 mi ( 1 @.@ [MASK] km ) to the southeast . In response , the Japanese launched a number of determined counterattacks over the course of the fol[MASK]owing week , althoug[MASK] these were turned back . During this time , the Australians sent a number of patrols out in front of the[MASK]r[MASK]forward element[MASK] , on[MASK] of whic[MASK] managed to slip through the Japanese defensive positions either side of the Buin Road and carried out a reconnaissance of the Hongorai River about 1[MASK]@,@ 000 yd ( 910 m ) south of the main crossing . Further patrol[MASK] were carried out , as well as a numbe[MASK] of ambushes , before the advance was resumed on 26 April . 
 Resuming their advance , the Australians were supported by three squadrons of Corsairs from t[MASK]e Royal New Ze[MASK]land Air Force — Nos. 14 , 22 and 26 Squadrons — w[MASK]ich bombed and strafed the ground in front of the advancing infantry , as well as a creeping barrage[MASK]of artillery and mortar fire . With suc[MASK] strong support the Japanese offered little resistance and over the[MASK]course of two days the 24th Infantry Battalion covere[MASK] almost a third of the di[MASK]tanc[MASK] to the Hongorai , [MASK]or just one man[MASK]wounded . Further progress was made [MASK]ver the next week , but on 4 May [MASK]he advance was slowed when the[MASK] encountered a roadblock defended by a field gun along wi[MASK]h a machine gun , mines and othe[MASK] improvised explos[MASK]ve devices . After this , the 15t[MASK] Brigade 's engineer support w[MASK]re called upon to regularly carry out route cleara[MASK]ce and proving operations as the Japanese became increasingly desperate to destroy the Australian armour , to the extent that they were prepared to sacrifice an artillery piece in order t[MASK] lure the Australian tanks into a trap where they could be destroyed by mines . The Japanese began to adapt their tactics in other ways also . To negate the effectiveness of the Australian ta[MASK]ks , the Japanese began to position themselves [MASK]ff the r[MASK]ads , forcin[MASK] the infantry to fight without their armoure[MASK] support . Additionally , the Japanese began to concentrate their[MASK]artillery with increa[MASK]ing accuracy upon the advancing infantry , which they kept under constant observation and fire . 
 Meanwhile [MASK] the previous day , 3 May , the 57th / 60th Infan[MASK]ry Battalion had begun operati[MASK]g along the parallel Commando Road to the north . Here they had a number of encounters and suffered casualties due to their inexperience[MASK]in patrolling , which resulted in them being ambushed . They also kept up a steady advance and eventually[MASK]beat the main force in reaching , and cr[MASK]ssing the river , arriving there [MASK]n 6 M[MASK]y . On 5 May , [MASK]long the Buin Road , th[MASK] 24th Infantry Battalion had pressed forward again . Advancing wit[MASK] a tank troop in support , they came up against a concealed field gun d[MASK]fended by approximately 100 Japanese . After the lead Matilda 's machine gu[MASK] jammed , the field gun opened fire on it , damaging it and wounding its crew . Moving around the stricken tank , t[MASK]e second Matilda , armed with a howitzer , opened fire and destroyed t[MASK]e field gun before sw[MASK]eping the Japanese defenders from the position . That night , the[MASK]Japanese artillery opened up on the Austra[MASK]ian position with a heavy barrage , and the following morning put in a company @-@ sized counter @-@ attack . [MASK]he fighting lasted for over two @-@ and @-@ a @-@ half hou[MASK]s , but whe[MASK] it was over the Australians remained in possession of the position having repulsed the attack . In doing so , they suffered one killed and nine wounded , while the attacking Japanese had suffered heavily , losing 58 men killed . It was the biggest loss s[MASK]nce the action at Slater 's Kno[MASK]l and it spelt[MASK]the end of [MASK]heir attempt[MASK]to defend the Hon[MASK]orai . 
 After this , the Australians were able to resume their advance to the river on 7 May without further opposition . Th[MASK] previous three wee[MASK]s in[MASK]which they had [MASK]dvanced 7 @,@ 000 [MASK]d ( 6 @,@ 400 m ) to the Hongorai had[MASK]been c[MASK]stly for them , h[MASK]wever , with th[MASK] Austral[MASK]an 24th Infantry Battalion losing 25 killed and 95 wound[MASK]d . Against this , the Japanese had lost at[MASK]least 169 killed . 
 
 = = = Crossing the Hongorai = = = 
 
 Following the advance to the Ho[MASK]gorai , there was a pa[MASK]se of about a[MASK]week as the Australians had to wait for roads to be improved an[MASK] supplies to be brought up , before a[MASK]tempting to cross the Hongorai en ma[MASK]se . This allowed Savige to[MASK]re @-@ evaluate the situation and to issue new orders for the advance towards the Hari and Mivo Rivers . As they waited for the advance to resume , the Australians carried out reconnaissance patrols [MASK]eep into Japanese held territory and there were a c[MASK][MASK]ple of significant engageme[MASK]ts during this time . As a part of these , the 24th Inf[MASK]ntry Battalion sent a company across the Hongorai and subsequently located a strong Japanese position on a feature that became known as Egan 's Ridge , which , due to its location , commanded the main Australian axis of advance . 
 The main crossing was planned for 20 May , with the 58th / 5[MASK]th Infantry Battalion on the right tasked to cut the Bu[MASK]n Road and the Aitara Track to the eas[MASK] of the river[MASK], while on the left the 57th / 60th Infantry Battalion would divert the a[MASK]tention of the Japanese [MASK]ff the 24th Infantry Battalion which would make the main frontal assault from the centre of the Australian line , crossing [MASK]t the Pororei ford , advancing stra[MASK]ght up the Buin Road .[MASK]Preliminary moves began before this , and on 15 M[MASK]y a platoon from the 24th Infan[MASK]ry Battalion along with two tanks attempt[MASK]d to carry out an attack on Egan 's Ridge .[MASK]After one of the tanks was held up and knocked out by a Japanese field gun , they were forced to withdraw . Meanwhile[MASK], th[MASK] RNZAF[MASK]Corsair squadrons — now reinforced by No[MASK][MASK]16 Squadron — began an eight @-@ day aerial campaign , attacking along the length of the Buin and Commando Roads . During this period , the New Zealanders flew 381 sorties , while artillery and mortars fired " thou[MASK]ands of rounds " . 
 T[MASK]o days later , on [MASK]7 [MASK]ay , the 57th / 60th Infantry Battali[MASK]n began its div[MASK]rsionary move on th[MASK] left flank , crossing the Hongorai inland and advanci[MASK]g along the Commando Road with 32 Corsairs and two batteries of[MASK]a[MASK]tiller[MASK] in support . Cros[MASK]ing 500 yd ( 460 m ) north of the ford , the centre company [MASK]arried out an [MASK]ttack along the far bank of[MASK]the river withou[MASK] i[MASK]s armoured support which had been unable to negotiate the crossing . Nevertheless , shortly before noon they had secured the crossing and began to fan o[MASK]t , carrying[MASK]out further flanking move[MASK] before establishing a firm base t[MASK] receive[MASK]supplies and [MASK]rom wher[MASK] it began patr[MASK]lling operations on 20 May . 
 In the centre , th[MASK] main a[MASK]tack along the Buin Road began at 08 : 30 on 20[MASK]May af[MASK]er 20 minutes of strafing by New Zealand Corsairs had prepared the ground . Advancing under a creeping barrage , and with morta[MASK] and machine gun support , th[MASK] 24th Infantry Battali[MASK]n moved forward with three compan[MASK]es up front and o[MASK]e held back in reserve , along with two troops of Matilda tanks . Mostly the forward companies reach[MASK]d their objec[MASK]ives , but one of the companies was halted just short of their objective and was forced to dig @-@ in overnight aft[MASK]r coming under heavy small arms and artillery fire and losing four killed and five w[MASK]unded . The attack was resumed the following day , and the Australians [MASK]ere able to advance to the Por[MASK]rei ford ; h[MASK]wever , they were prevented from moving [MASK]ny further as the Japanese were still conc[MASK]ntrated in large numbers furt[MASK]e[MASK] to the west where an Australian patrol encountered 70 Japanese and were forced to go to ground . Finally , a company from the 24th Infantry Battalion was able to move on to the high ground on Egan 's Ridge , which they found to be heavily mined and booby t[MASK]apped . Engi[MASK]eers and a[MASK]sault pioneers were called up to clear[MASK]the feature . 
 On the rig[MASK]t flank , the 58th / 59th Infantry Battali[MASK]n carried out a wide flanking move along a track that had been carved out of the west bank of the Hongorai by bulldozer . Beginning their move two days earlier , a number of patrols had had contacts with t[MASK]e Japanese . Meanwhile , using tractors to drag the tanks through the mud , the A[MASK]stralian armour had crossed the river also and by 16 :[MASK]00 on 20 M[MASK]y the battalion had[MASK]manag[MASK]d to est[MASK]blish itself in an assembly area to th[MASK] east of the river , [MASK]nbeknown to the Japanese [MASK] The following day , the battalion left the line of departure and began to advance on its primary objective , which it[MASK]reached in the early afternoon d[MASK]spite being held up while the tanks attempted to affect a creek crossing , and further[MASK]delayed by stiff resistance . Later , after one of the battalion 's patrols came under heavy fire , the tanks moved up and[MASK]attacked a Japanese gun position which the defenders[MASK]quickl[MASK] abandoned , leaving behind a 7[MASK] mm gun and a large amount of ammuni[MASK]ion . 
 By 22 Ma[MASK] , although there were still a number of Japanese in the area which continued to harass and ambush their line of communications , most [MASK]f the Austra[MASK]ian objectives had been secured and mopping up operations began . The last remaining defensive location before the Hongorai was Egan 's Ridge , where the Japanese were sheltering i[MASK] tunnels . A heavy aerial and artillery bombardment devastated the position and forced them [MASK]o aban[MASK]on the ridge . It was subsequently occupied by a company of Australian infantry . Wi[MASK]hin a short perio[MASK] of [MASK]ime the Buin Road was subsequently opened , providing the [MASK]ustralians with[MASK]the means with which to bring up sup[MASK]lies for the next stage of the campaign , bei[MASK]g the advance to the Hari , Mobiai , and Mivo Rivers . The final phase of the battle cost the Japanese 106 killed , while the Australians lost 13 killed and 64 wounded . 
 
 = = Aftermath = = 
 
 During the course of the fighting around the Hong[MASK]rai , the Australians lo[MASK]t 38 m[MASK]n killed and 159 wounded , while the Japanese lost at least 275 men k[MASK]lled . Following the battle , the Aus[MASK]ralians continued their advance towards Buin at the southern end of the island [MASK] Throughout the rem[MASK]inder of the month and[MASK]into June , the 15th Brigade advanced along the Buin Road , crossing the Hari on [MASK]0 June . Beyond the river , the Japanese resolve[MASK] to hold the food growing areas in orde[MASK] to protect t[MASK]eir precarious food supply , and they consequently occupied a series of deep entrenchments . Thes[MASK] were steadily reduced with airstrikes and artillery , and the 15th Brigade s[MASK]bsequently crossed Mobiai River before b[MASK]ing relieved by Brigadier Noel [MASK]impson 's 29th Brigade in[MASK]early July . 
 As [MASK]he 29t[MASK] Bri[MASK]ade advanced toward the Mivo River , torrential [MASK]ain and flood[MASK]ng ultimately brought the advance to a[MASK]halt . The height of the riv[MASK]r rose 2 metres ( 6 @.@ 6 ft ) . [MASK]he Buin Road was reduced , in the words of Gavin Long , "[MASK]t[MASK] a sea of mud " [MASK]nd many of the bridges upon which the Australian supply system was dependent were [MASK]ashed away[MASK]. This rendered large @-@ scale offensive infantry operat[MASK]ons impossible and as the situation worsened [MASK]or a period of time [MASK]he Australians even ceased patrolling operations across the Mivo ; meanwhile , the Japanese continued to harass the Australians , probing[MASK]their positions and setting mines and traps , targeting the Australian line of communications . On 9 July , the 15th I[MASK]fantry Batta[MASK]ion fought off a series of attacks aro[MASK]nd Siskatekori , at the junction of the Mivo River and th[MASK][MASK]Buin Road , which included a heavy Japanese artillery bomb[MASK]rdment . Australian patrols were resumed in[MASK]late July and continued into August . These attacks proved very costly , particularly amongst the[MASK]Australian engineers that were tasked with rebuilding the bridges and roads that had been destroyed in the flooding . 
 Fighting in the northern sector cont[MASK]nued during this time also , and although preparations in the south for the final advance towards Buin co[MASK]tinued into August , combat operations on the island ceased as the war[MASK]came to an end before these were completed . As a result , the final Australian operations on Bougainville took place on the Ratsua front i[MASK] the northern sector , where the Australians had been conducting a holding action since the failed landing at Porton Plantation ha[MASK] force[MASK] them to abandon plans for an advance into the Bonis Penin[MASK]ula . By mid @-@ August , however , following the dropping of two atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki and Japan 's subsequent unconditional surrender , a cease fire [MASK]as ordered on the island and[MASK]although there were minor clashe[MASK] following this , [MASK]t spelt an end[MASK]to major combat operations . 
 Following the end[MASK]of the war , the Australian Army awarded three battle honours for the fig[MASK]ting around the Hongorai River . The 2 / 4th Armoured Regiment , and the 9th , 24th , 57th[MASK]/ 60th and 58th / 59th Infantry Battalions received the battle hono[MASK]r " Hongorai River " . A second battle honour — "[MASK]Egan 's Ridge – Hongorai F[MASK]r[MASK] " — was also awarded to the 2 / 4th Armoured Regiment , and the 24th and 58th[MASK]/ 59th Infantry Battalions fo[MASK] the second stage of the fighting , while the 57th / 60th Infantry Battalion received the separate battle honour of " Commando Road " for this period . 
 
 
 = Sonic [MASK]he Hedgehog ( 1991 v[MASK]deo game ) = 
 
 Sonic the Hedge[MASK]og is a platform video game developed by Sonic Team and publ[MASK]shed by Sega for the Sega Genesis console . The game was first released in North Ameri[MASK]a , Europe a[MASK]d Australia in June 1991 [MASK] and in Japan the following month . The game features an [MASK]nthropomorphic hedgehog named Sonic i[MASK] a quest to defeat Dr. R[MASK]b[MASK]tnik , a scientist who has imprisoned animals in robots and stolen the magical Chaos Emeralds . Sonic the Hedgehog 's gameplay involves collecting rings as a form of health and a simple control scheme , with jumping and attacking[MASK]controlled by a single butt[MASK]n . 
 The game 's development began in 1990 , when Sega or[MASK]ered its AM8 development team to create a game featuring a mascot for the co[MASK]pany . After considering a n[MASK]mber of suggestions , the[MASK]developers decided on a blue hedgehog wi[MASK]h spikes along his head and spine and renamed them[MASK]elv[MASK]s " S[MASK]nic Team " to match their character . Sonic the[MASK]Hedgehog , designed for fast gameplay , w[MASK]s influen[MASK]ed by the games of Super Mario series creator , Shigeru Miyamoto . Sonic the Hedgehog uses a novel technique that allows Sonic 's sprite to roll a[MASK]ong cur[MASK]ed scenery , which originated in a tech [MASK]emo created by the game 's programmer , Yuji Naka . 
 The game was well received[MASK]by critics , who prais[MASK]d its visual[MASK] , m[MASK]sic [MASK] and speed of gamep[MASK]ay . The game was also commercially successful , establishing the [MASK]enesi[MASK] as a key pl[MASK]yer in the 16 @-@ bit era and allowing it to compete with Nintendo and their Super NES console . It has been ported a number of times , and inspired several clones , a successful franchise , and adaptations by other media . 
 
 = = Plot = = 
 
 In an attempt to steal the s[MASK]x Chaos Emeralds and harness their power , the game 's antagonist , Dr. Ivo Ro[MASK]otnik , h[MASK]s trapped the animal inhabitants of South Island in aggressive robots and stationary metal capsules . The pla[MASK]er controls Sonic , who aims to halt Robotnik 's plans by freeing his animal friends and collecti[MASK][MASK] the emeralds himself . 
 If the player collects all the Chaos Emeralds and completes the game , a reward ending [MASK]equence is shown . If a[MASK]l the emeralds are not c[MASK]llected , Robotnik taunts the player while juggling the Chaos Emeralds instead . 
[MASK][MASK] = = Gameplay = = 
 
 Sonic the Hedgehog is a 2D , side @-@ scrolling platformer , whose gameplay centers around[MASK]Sonic '[MASK] ability to run at high speed through levels incorporating springs , slopes , high falls , and loop @-@ the @[MASK]@ loops . The levels contain hazards in the form of robots ( " bad[MASK]iks " in the Western game manuals )[MASK]inside of which Dr. Robotnik has trapped animals . Although destroying a robot frees the animal w[MASK]thin , [MASK]his is not required to complete the game . The player mu[MASK]t avoid rows of sharp spikes , falling into bottomless pits , being crushed by moving wall[MASK] or platforms , and drowning ( which can [MASK]e avoided by breathing air bubbles per[MASK]odically released from ven[MASK]s ) . Sonic 's main attack is his spin , where he curls into a ball and rotates rapidly ( damaging enemies and some obstacles ) . This can be performed by jumping in the air or rolling on the ground . 
 Scattere[MASK] around each level map are gold rings , and collecting 100 rings [MASK]ewards the player with [MASK]n extra life .[MASK]Rings are a layer of protection ag[MASK]inst haz[MASK]rds ; if Sonic has at le[MASK]st one ring when he[MASK]collides with an enemy ( or ob[MASK]tacle ) , he will survive . However [MASK] all his rings will be scattered ; they will flicker and disap[MASK]ear in a few seconds if they are not picked up [MASK]gain . [MASK]f Sonic is hit [MASK]ithout any rings [MASK] he loses a life . Altho[MASK]gh shields and temporary invincibility may[MASK]be collected [MASK]o provide additional protection , certain hazards ( such as drowning , being crushed , falling down [MASK] bottomless pit or ru[MASK]ning out of time ) will cost Sonic [MASK] life regardless[MASK]of rings or other protection . 
 The game is divided into six zones ( Green Hill , Marble , Spr[MASK]ng Y[MASK]rd , Labyrinth , Star Light , [MASK]nd Scrap Brain ) , each with its own visual style and enemi[MASK]s . A player must navigate thr[MASK]ugh each zone ( subdivide[MASK] into three acts ) to progress . At the end of each zone 's third[MASK]act , the player co[MASK]fronts Dr. Robotnik ( who [MASK]ilots a different vehicle each time ) in[MASK]a boss f[MASK]ght . After the sixth zone , the player continues directly to the Final[MASK]Zone for a last encount[MASK]r with Robotnik . 
 The player begins with three lives ( power @-@ ups and rings add more ) , which are [MASK]ost when Sonic collides with hazardous enemies ( or objects ) without rings , fall[MASK] off [MASK]-@[MASK]screen or exceeds an act 's ten @-@ minute time limit[MASK]. Lampposts acting as checkpoints allow Sonic to return to the most @-@ recently activated post when he loses a life . If he loses a life as a result of tim[MASK] run[MASK]ing out but has [MASK]nother life , the timer will reset to 0 : 00 when he returns to the checkpoint . If all lives are lost at [MASK]ny point in the game , the game over screen will appear ( when the player can r[MASK]turn to the beginning of th[MASK] act with thr[MASK]e[MASK]lives , if they have any continues ) . 
 When Sonic reaches the end of act one or act two of a zone with at least fifty rings , a large ring appears through which he can jump to enter a Special Stage ( a " Secret Zone " in the original Genesis manual ) [MASK] In each of six Special Stages , Sonic bounces off the bump[MASK]rs and walls of a rotating maze in spin attack . Although the player earns a continue with each 50 rings found , their main goal i[MASK] to obta[MASK][MASK] the Chaos E[MASK]erald at the end of the maze without colliding with[MASK]a [MASK] goal block " ( which ends the level ) .

 In 1990 , Sega ordered its in @-@ house development studio , AM8 , to develop a game featuri[MASK]g a mascot for th[MASK] company . This was a po[MASK]ition [MASK]lready held by the character Alex Kidd , but he was considered simi[MASK]ar to Mario and deemed unsatisfactory ; Sega p[MASK]eside[MASK]t Hayao Nakayama wanted a character as iconic as Mickey Mouse . Sega had competitio[MASK] from Nintendo and its mascot , Mario , in mind ; Nintendo was dominant at the time , particularly after the release of the successful Super Mario[MASK]Bros. 3 , and Sega wanted a foot[MASK]old in the industry . Althou[MASK]h the company had some [MASK]uccess with Gene[MASK]is ports of its arcade titles , it knew this would not be enough .[MASK]
 AM8 developed ideas for characters , an engine , and gam[MASK]play mechanics . Development emphasized speed , so AM8 eliminated character designs not assoc[MASK]ated [MASK]ith fast animals , as wel[MASK] as f[MASK]st creatures like kangaroos and squirrels . One idea , a rabbit able to grasp objects with[MASK]prehensile ears , showed promise at first but was too complex for the available hardware . The team narrowed its search to[MASK]anim[MASK]ls that can roll into a ball , their idea for an attacking move . Designers then realized that this would not seem aggressive enough , so they f[MASK]cused on two [MASK]nimal[MASK] with s[MASK]ikes : armadillos and hedgehogs . The hedgehog character , fir[MASK]t proposed by Naoto Ohshima , prevailed , although the a[MASK]madillo would later become the basis for Mighty the [MASK]rmadillo ( who firs[MASK] appeared in 1993 's SegaSonic the Hedgehog ) . Ohshima has admitted since th[MASK]t he created Sonic 's basic design by c[MASK]m[MASK]ining Felix the Cat 's head with Mickey Mouse 's body . 
 Sonic was originally teal @-@ colored , t[MASK]en a light shade of blue , but he [MASK]as changed to dark blue so he would stand out against certain background[MASK] and to match the Sega logo . His shoes were colored [MASK]ed through the inspiration of Michael Jackson 's boots on the al[MASK]um cover for Bad and the outfit of Santa Claus , whom Ohshima saw as the most " famo[MASK]s character in the worl[MASK] " . Sonic 's spikes were emphasized to make him look sleeker , and he was given the ability to spin while jumping ( so attacking and jumping could be controlled with one butto[MASK] ) . The ne[MASK] character was originally named " Mr. Needlemouse " , but the eight @-@ member AM8 changed his name to " Sonic " and their studios to Sonic Team . Ideas proposed to fl[MASK]sh out the character included pl[MASK]cing him in a rock b[MASK]nd , giving him vampire fangs , and giving him a human girlfriend n[MASK]med Madonna , but Sega of America scrapped these ideas to keep his identity simple . Sega of America also expre[MASK]sed concerns that most Americans would not know what a hedgehog is [MASK]nd in[MASK]tially proposed a full @-@ scale recreation[MASK]of the character , but compromised with Sonic Team to simply make design changes . The antagonist ended up being named " Dr. Eggman " in Japan and " Dr. Robotnik " in other regions as a result of a dispute between Sega 's Ameri[MASK]an and Japanese divisions . 
 
 = = = Programming and prototyping = = = 
 
 With a satisfying protagonist com[MASK]leted , Sega turned to esteemed programmer Yuji Naka , who had impr[MASK]ssed them through his work on Phantasy Star and the G[MASK]nesis port of Ghouls ' n Ghosts . The gamepl[MASK]y originate[MASK] with a tech demo by Naka , who developed an algorithm allowing a sprite to move smoo[MASK]hly on a curve by determining its position with a dot matrix . Naka 's prototype was a platform game with a fa[MASK]t @-@ moving character rolling in a ball throug[MASK] a long , winding tube , and this concept was fleshed out with Ohshima 's character designs and level[MASK] by designer Hirokazu Yasuhara . Yasuhara originally intended to work on the game for three months due to the delay of hi[MASK] p[MASK]anned move to the United States by the outbreak of the Gulf War , but was engros[MASK]ed in the project for nearly a year . His designs for levels were intended to a[MASK]tract both hardcore and casual gamers by integrating occasional challenging set pieces into the mos[MASK]ly accessible level des[MASK][MASK]n . The game 's col[MASK]r scheme was influenced by th[MASK] work of pop artist Eizin Suzuki[MASK], and the[MASK]aesthetics of Green Hill were influenced by the geogra[MASK][MASK]y of California . 
 In designing the game mechanics , Naka was inspired by Shigeru Miyamoto , whose games he had enjoyed playing years e[MASK]rlier . Admiring the simplicity of Miyamo[MASK]o 's [MASK]echanics in complex environments , Naka decided that Sonic would be controlled with only a directional pad for movement and a single button for jumping . He also wanted his creation to be more action @-@ oriented than the Mario series ; while playing Super M[MASK]rio Bros. ,[MASK]he had wondered why the levels could not be cleared more quick[MASK]y . [MASK]ue to the need t[MASK] demonstrate the Ge[MASK]esis ' technological prowess , the developing game[MASK]underwent extensive testing and rede[MASK]ign , a process taking over six months . Th[MASK] developers ' effo[MASK]ts were rewarded ; according to [MASK]uji Naka , the game had t[MASK]e fastest @-@ ever character s[MASK]eed in a video game and a rotation effect in t[MASK]e special stages that was considered impossible on the co[MASK]sole . The team inte[MASK]ded to add a two @-@ player mode displayed via split[MASK]@-@ screen , but Naka 's programming knowledge was insufficient to implement this feature . However , such a mo[MASK]e would later appear in sequel Sonic the Hedgehog 2 ( 1992 ) , where the[MASK]secon[MASK] player would control Sonic 's b[MASK]st friend Miles " Tails " Prower . Na[MASK]a , Oshi[MASK]a , and Yasuhara work[MASK]d 19 hours a day[MASK]on the project for several months . 
 Naka 's relatio[MASK][MASK]hip with Sega of Japan was tenuous during this time ; he received little credit for his involve[MASK]ent in the game . He left the company shortly after the game 's r[MASK]lease , although Sega of America hired him later . B[MASK][MASK]o[MASK]e leaving , however , he def[MASK]ed Sega of Japan 's prohibition of developer credits b[MASK] displaying a f[MASK]w names in black text on a black background , ide[MASK]tifiable only by lookin[MASK] at the game 's code . 
 
 = = = Music = = = 
 
 The music[MASK]for Sonic the Hedgehog was composed and produced by Masato Nakamura[MASK], bassist an[MASK] lead songwriter of the J @-@ pop band Dreams Come True . The game uses onboard Yamaha YM2612 and SN76489 programmable sound generators to produce a variety of stereo sound effects and music . I[MASK] was originally intended to have a sound test menu with anim[MASK]tions of Sonic breakdancing to[MASK]the music of a " Sonic Band " of Sharps Chicken on guitar , Max Mo[MASK]key on bass , Mach R[MASK]bbit [MASK]n drums , an[MASK] Vector the Crocodile on keyboard . The playable Vector became a recurring character in the s[MASK]ries , also appearing in Knuckles ' Chaotix , Sonic Heroes , and Sonic Free Riders[MASK]. The development schedule sc[MASK]apped the feature , and Yuji Naka replaced the test with the " Se @-[MASK] ga ! " chant used in TV commercials ( which reportedly used one @-@ eighth of the memory of the four @-@ megabit cartridg[MASK] ) . 
 On October 19 , 2011 , twenty years after the game 's release , a three @-@ disc compilation of music from Sonic the Hedgehog an[MASK] Soni[MASK] the Hedgehog 2 was released in Japan . The first disc features original tracks[MASK]from bo[MASK]h games , the second contains Masato Nakam[MASK]ra 's demo recordings and the third comprises songs by Dreams Come True and their Akon remixes .

 Game @-@ package illustrator Akira Watana[MASK]e said that his goal was to make the characters " colorful [MASK] , [MASK]sing clear lines and gradation to " finish them neatly " . According to Watanabe , the developers asked him to crea[MASK]e a package design " similar to pop art ... without being particular to convent[MASK]onal packages " – something " origin[MASK]l " and " stylish " . The game was released in North America , Europe , and Australia on June[MASK]23 , 1991 , and in Japan on July 26 . Sega of America packaged it with American Genesis consoles , replacing Altered Beast . Genesis owne[MASK]s who bought their consol[MASK]s before the switch could request free co[MASK]ies of Sonic the[MASK]Hedgehog by mail . Sega of America created a large @-@ scale marketing campaign to promote the game and Sonic as a mascot for the company .

 Soni[MASK] the Hedgehog was critically praised at its release and in retrospective reviews , with an 86 @-@ percent approval rating at the review aggregator GameRankings based on nine[MASK]reviews . The game rivaled the Mario series , particularly Super Mario World ( which was recently released for Genesis rival Super Nintendo Entertainment S[MASK]ste[MASK] ) . Paul Rand of Computer and Video Games compared [MASK]he two in dep[MASK]h and chara[MASK]terized Sonic the Hedgehog as being faster , with br[MASK]ghter co[MASK]ors , and Super Mario World as having more " depth[MASK]of play " . 
 Reviewers noted the game 's col[MASK]rful , detailed graphics . Rand [MASK]alled its color scheme " lively , but ne[MASK]er garish " , praising the interaction of color with detail in the sprites , backgrounds , and animation[MASK] and describing its graphics as the b[MASK]st available for the Genesis . Reviewer Boogie Man of GamePro called the intricate backgrounds " eye @-@ p[MASK]pping " and " gorgeous " , which was echoed by Mean Machine[MASK] . According to the Le[MASK]sers ( Hartley , Patricia , and Kirk ) of Dragon , " The graphics and animation in Sonic the Hedgehog make this a serious contender for the best video game of the year " and GameZone called the animation " some of the smoothest and fastest ... ever seen " . The music and sound effects were also well received ; Dragon called them " great " , and GameZone " amazing " . Rand noted " stacks of catchy tunes and jingles " , calling some of th[MASK] sound effects " absolutely brilliant " . Alt[MASK]ough Mean Machines called the songs " vaguely appealing " , the game 's sound effects were better appreciated . 
 Critics cited the fast gameplay , unprecedented in platformers . GamePro 's Boogie Man noted its " lightning @-@ fast action " and , according to Electronic Gaming Monthly ( EGM ) , " If you thought the Enterprise was quick , wait till you see Sonic at warp speed . " The game[MASK]'s difficulty was disputed , described as " impossible " by Rand and " average " by EGM . Rand said about the gameplay in general that it " pla[MASK]s like a dream " ; acc[MASK]rding[MASK]to Game[MASK]one it would enchant players for hours , and Boogie Man praised Sonic Team 's ability[MASK]to provide an engaging experience primarily from running and jump[MASK]ng . Although EGM , Dragon , and Paul of Mean Machines praised the level design ( especially the hidden rooms ) ,[MASK]Paul found losing all of one 's rings f[MASK]ustrating . 
 Sonic[MASK]the Hedgehog has maintained its popularity , appearing[MASK]on lists of the greatest video games of [MASK]ll time . Frank Provo of GameSpot described the game as " one of the[MASK]best platformers[MASK]of all time " , noting that despite technical[MASK]issues in the Game Boy Adv[MASK]nce port [MASK] after all these years , the unde[MASK]lying gr[MASK]phics , audio , and gam[MASK][MASK]lay still hold up " . Lucas M. Thomas of IGN agreed that[MASK]it stood the test of time : " You '[MASK]l be impressed by the clarity and color that come through ... Few[MASK]people realize ho[MASK] difficult it was to[MASK]create Sonic 's graphics engine , which all[MASK]wed for the incredible rat[MASK] of speed the game 's known for . But the technical achievement impressed back in ' 91 [MASK] and still does so today . " Mega ranked the g[MASK]me its third @-@ favorite Genesis title , and in 2001 Game Informer called it the 24th @-@ greatest game of all time . Sonic the Hedgehog has been a commercial success ; the o[MASK]iginal[MASK]Genesis version sold o[MASK]er 15 million cop[MASK]es by F[MASK]bruary 2009 , and the mobile version had eight million [MASK][MASK]id downloads by 2008 [MASK]

 Prima[MASK]ily because of its Genesis bundling , Sonic [MASK]he Hedgeho[MASK] [MASK]o[MASK]tributed to the console 's[MASK]North American popularity . During Octob[MASK]r – December 1991 , the Genesis outsold the Super NES by a two @-@ to @-@ one ratio , an[MASK] at its J[MASK]nuary 1992 peak claimed 65 percent of t[MASK]e market for 16 @-@ bit consoles . Although Nintendo eventua[MASK]ly[MASK]again overtook Sega , this was the first[MASK]time since December 1[MASK]85 that the company di[MASK] not lead the console market . 
 Sonic the Hedgehog added speed and m[MASK]mentum @-@ based physics to the standard platform [MASK]ormula . Set @-@ pieces and mec[MASK]anics introduced by the game ( such as loops , springs , and acceleration pads ) have a[MASK]peared in other games a[MASK]d become associated with the Sonic series . 
 A flood of " animal with attitude " platformers , each featuring a[MASK]cartoon mascot , were released aft[MASK]r Sonic the He[MASK]gehog : Bubsy , A[MASK]ro the Acro @-@[MASK]Ba[MASK] , James Pond 3 , Earthworm Jim , Zero the Kamikaze Squirrel , [MASK]we[MASK]ome Possum , Ty the Tasma[MASK]ian Tiger , Gex . This carried into the PlayStation era with games [MASK]ike [MASK]unky Skunk a[MASK]d Crash Bandicoot .

 The game 's success led Sega to develop an extensive media franchise . A 1992 sequel , Sonic the Hed[MASK]e[MASK]og 2 , gave Sonic[MASK]a best friend ( and sidekick )[MASK]named[MASK]Miles " Tails " Prower and[MASK]continued the fight against Dr. Robotnik [MASK] S[MASK]nic has generated[MASK]doz[MASK]ns of additional games and a large cast of recurring characters ( keeping Sonic and[MASK]Robo[MASK]nik as m[MASK]insta[MASK]s ) , sur[MASK]iving the end of Sega console manufacturing after the Dreamcast . The series has ventured from platformers to fighting , racing , role @-@ playing , and sports games , and has expanded into anime and manga , cartoons and comic books , n[MASK]vels , and toys . Sonic the Hed[MASK]ehog has become one of [MASK]he best @-@ s[MASK]lling video game franchises of [MASK]ll ti[MASK]e , with over 150 million copies sold by May 2014 . The game 's first stage , Green Hill Zone , has[MASK]also bee[MASK] re @-@ purposed for use in several oth[MASK]r titles such as Sonic Adventure 2 , Son[MASK]c Generations and the Super Smash Bros. series .

[MASK]" The Same Old Story " is the [MASK]econd episode of the [MASK]irst season of the American science fiction drama television series Fringe . The episode was written by executive producer Jeff Pinkner an[MASK] co @[MASK]@ creators J. J. Abrams ,[MASK]Alex Kurtzman , and Roberto Orci . When developing the s[MASK]ries , they sought to find a med[MASK]um between serialized drama and the crim[MASK] procedural . " The Same Old [MASK]tory " wa[MASK] the first regular episode of Fringe , and journalists viewed it as[MASK]an exam[MASK]le of what they could expect from the series . It was directed [MASK]y Paul A. Edwards . 
 After a newborn baby[MASK]r[MASK]pidly ages into an 80 @-@ ye[MASK]r @-@ old[MASK]man , Fringe division agent Olivia Dun[MASK]am ( Anna Torv ) and [MASK]onsultants Peter ( Joshua Jackson ) and Walter Bis[MASK]op ( John Noble ) investigate . They tie the case to the murders of young women , who have all [MASK]ad th[MASK]ir pituitary glands rem[MASK]ved . It is revealed that Dr. Claus Penrose ( Mark Blum ) , an expert in progeria , is working to help his son Christ[MASK]pher ( Derek Cecil ) stay [MASK]live , as he suffers from rapid aging syndrome . 
 " The Same Old Story " first aired in the United States on September 16 , 2008 on Fox . An estimated 13 @.@ 272 million viewers watched the episode , a 45 percent increase from the series premiere . The episode r[MASK]ceived mixed reviews from television critics – reviewer[MASK] thought it was an improvement from the pre[MASK]ious episode but faulted it for containing plot contrivances . 
 
 [MASK] = Plot [MASK] = 
 
 A prostitute is abandoned by an unknown man at a hospital , dan[MASK]erously in labor . She dies[MASK]as the doctors perform a caesarean section , but the child ages rapidly in minutes , soon dead having aged to the likes of an 80 @-@ year @-@ old man . Olivia Dunham ( Anna Torv ) , Peter Bishop ( Joshua Jackson ) , and Walter Bishop ( John Noble ) , new members of the Frin[MASK]e division , are ca[MASK]led to investigate by division head Phillip Broyles ( Lance Reddick ) , believing the case to be part of " The Pattern " ,[MASK]a string of mysterious incidents . The woman is identi[MASK]ied as ha[MASK]ing recently left a local motel , and Olivia finds evidence that points to a past [MASK]erial murder case she and her former partner John[MASK][MASK]cott were not able to solve . Olivia explains to Peter [MASK]hat their murderer would paralyze his victims , young women , then make [MASK]n incision along [MASK]heir face to extract a piece of brain material , [MASK]i[MASK]ling the victim[MASK]in the process . Walter t[MASK]kes [MASK]oth corpses back to his lab an[MASK] determines that the woman had only been pregnant minutes before giving birth , her child having accelerated agi[MASK]g disease . Walter is reminded of having previously done work in this field , and remembers where he stashed his car that contains the related files . Once they are[MASK]retrieved , Olivia makes a connection[MASK]to the pituitary gland which controls growth in humans , and informs Charlie F[MASK]ancis ( Kirk Acevedo ) to monitor r[MASK]cent cases where the victims ' pituitary gland has been removed . 
 Olivia and Peter turn to an expert in progeria [MASK] Dr. Penrose ( Mark Blum ) , to trying t[MASK] learn more about rapid aging , but Dr. Penrose cannot help t[MASK]em further , though Peter s[MASK]sp[MASK]cts he is hiding something . Uns[MASK]en by the Fringe division , Dr. Penrose visits an abandoned warehouse and meets the murderer , Christopher ( Derek Cecil ) , his son , who suffers from rapid aging syndrome . Penrose warns Christopher to be careful and that they only need one more woman to [MASK]omplete the process . B[MASK] this time , Charlie has found a recent murder victim killed in [MASK]he same fashion as Olivia 's serial murdere[MASK] . At Walter 's [MASK]ab , th[MASK]y identify the pituitary gland has bee[MASK] removed . The[MASK] rationalize the murderer must extract hormones from the glands to slow down his own[MASK]aging process . Walter hypothesizes they can discov[MASK]r the location of the crime by looking at the im[MASK]ges left in the woman 's optical nerves induced by the paralyzing sedative . Borr[MASK]wing an electronic pulse[MASK]camera from Massi[MASK]e Dynamic , they discover the image of a suspension bridge[MASK]near Stoughton and identif[MASK] the likely location from which it was viewed — the same warehouse that Dr. Penrose visited . The FBI[MASK]converge on the building , and Olivia and Peter find Penrose abou[MASK] to cu[MASK] i[MASK]to another victim . Ol[MASK]via chases off after Christopher , who eventual[MASK]y succumbs to his rapid aging and dies , while Peter , after nicking Penrose with a bullet , confers with Wa[MASK]ter to apply a makeshift defibrillator to bri[MASK]g the victim back to life . 
 As they wrap up the case , Olivia , Peter , and Walter complete forms to finalize their position in the Fringe division . When Peter is out of earshot , Walter learns from Olivia that the FBI medical files on Peter 's childhood are void of any details .

 Co @-@ creators J. J. Abrams , Alex Kurtzman and Roberto Orci , and executive producer Jeff Pinkner w[MASK]ote the ep[MASK]sode . Paul A. Edwards s[MASK]rved as th[MASK] director , his first such credi[MASK] for the serie[MASK] . In developing Fringe , the co @-@ creators did not want to make[MASK]the series too serialized , as[MASK]th[MASK]s was a co[MASK]plaint often directed at Abrams ' television series Alias . T[MASK]ey wanted to find a balance between standalone stories and serialized content , and studied p[MASK]ocedural dramas such as Law and Order and CSI : Crime Scene Investigation for inspiration . Kurztman explained , " While we make sure that our episodes are sel[MASK] @-@ contained – have a beginning , a middle , and an end – the c[MASK]aracter stories can be serialized . They don 't h[MASK]ve to resolve[MASK]themselves over the course of on[MASK] show . " " The Same Old Story " was Fringe 's first regular episode , an[MASK] some journalists viewed it as an example of how the series would be structured . 
 The episode was based [MASK]n actual rece[MASK]t[MASK]research and involved much collaboration among the ser[MASK]es ' different departments . For the s[MASK]ene in wh[MASK]ch they remove the victim 's[MASK]eyeball , the special effect[MASK] crew created a mold based on actress Elizabeth[MASK]Stanl[MASK]y 's head . Using plaster to mak[MASK] a prosthetic , they " drilled out the eyeball and sculpt [ ed ] it open and [ went ] through a series of molds . " Stanley stated that " it 's really cool to see the head because it really do[MASK]s look just [MASK]ike me , even though it 's very gruesome because the eyeball 's popping out . " The prop department rigged [MASK] weap[MASK][MASK] which they called a " photon gun " ; according to pro[MASK] master Peter Gelfman , this gun was based on real [MASK]evices employed in airport security that look th[MASK]ough people[MASK]'[MASK] clothing for concealed weapons . VFX Supervisor Christopher Scollard explained that for the eye 's last v[MASK]sion , t[MASK]ey used " a lot [MASK]f actual photo[MASK]raphic referen[MASK]e on the [MASK]et and on the location , " which they then used to " take that imag[MASK]ry and composite it into the various computer monitors and dis[MASK]lays in the lab .[MASK]" 
 " The Same Ol[MASK] Story " featured guest appearances by actors Der[MASK]k Cecil as Christopher Penrose and Mark Blum as his father , Dr. Claus Penrose .

 " The Same Old Story " received mixed reviews from television critics . TV Squad writer Jane Boursaw thought [MASK]he episode seemed " all over the place " , and wasn 't sure what to think . She stated the two most interesting parts of the episode were when Walter remo[MASK]ed the girl 's eye in order to iden[MASK]ity her killer , and the cliffhanger at[MASK]the very end , when Walter states " If yo[MASK] 've read [MASK]y file , then you know the t[MASK]uth about Peter 's m[MASK]dical histor[MASK] " . Travis Fickett of IGN thought it was better than the pil[MASK]t ; though it[MASK]was " laden with lots of clunky[MASK]ex[MASK]osition and clichéd dial[MASK]gue , " Fickett understood that it was needed to acquaint new viewers to the show . Fickett concluded his review by[MASK]saying Fringe has t[MASK]e potential to be a " gre[MASK]t show " , and he a[MASK]so praised the[MASK]production level as " top notch " , and Torv 's performance as " very good " as she " brings a unique presence to t[MASK]e show " . The A.V. Club critic[MASK]Noel Murray ga[MASK][MASK] the episode a C + , while Television Without Pity graded it with a B. 
 Josh Jackson of [MASK]aste Magazine disliked the " deus ex machina " as[MASK]ects that " neatly solved the puzzles of the first two episodes " , and also criticized per[MASK]eived " plot[MASK]contrivances " like how the serial[MASK]murderer immediately began aging once interr[MASK]pted from killing his last [MASK]ictim . Despite these flaws , Jackson said he would tune in[MASK]next week because he would " rat[MASK]er hav[MASK] a show err on the side of unbelievable than unremarkable ,[MASK]and I 'm interested to[MASK]see if Abrams has any more tricks up his sleeve " . Erin Fox of TV Guide also liked " The Same[MASK]Old Story " better than the pilot because[MASK]she thought that it " had really cool special effects , awesome Walter @-@ isms , and actual chemistry forming between [MASK]livia and Peter " , and " we also got to delve more into the conne[MASK]tions [MASK]etween Walter , Nina Sharp , Massive Dynamic and the government and the experiments they conducted before Walter was institutionalized " . 
 A UGO Network[MASK] columnist was concerned that the expensive pilot would be har[MASK] to translate into weekly episodes , but " after sitting down to w[MASK]tch Fringe 's secon[MASK] episode , [MASK] The Same Old Story " , my concerns have vanished . Fri[MASK][MASK]e 's second episode represents all that is holy about genre programming without sacrificing any of Fringe 's eleven @-@ herbs and spices . In fact , the subtle framework of what makes Fringe not X @-@ Files is[MASK]even bette[MASK] defined in the first weekly @-@ episode . I 'd struggl[MASK]d to find the word to describe it , and the winner is[MASK]' condensed ' . " The Same Old Story " has all of the sense of mystery , discov[MASK]ry , and humor that the pilot[MASK]had [MASK]ust in a smaller , mo[MASK]e combustible space . " Another UGO writer , Alex Zalben , later compared " The Same Old Story " to the similarly @-@ plotted The X @-@ Files episode " Død Kalm " .

 The Randy Blythe manslaughter case w[MASK]s a court case in the Czech Republic , stemming from a 2010 Lamb of God concert in Prague , wherein[MASK]19 @-@ year @-@ [MASK]ld fan Daniel Nosek sustained head injuries leading to a coma and[MASK]subseque[MASK]t death . During the inve[MASK]tigat[MASK]on , Czech police unsuccessfully asked United States authorities for cooperation [MASK] When the band returned to th[MASK] [MASK]zech Republic for anot[MASK]er concert [MASK]wo years later , [MASK]ts vocalist Randy Blythe was arrested , charged[MASK]with causing Nosek 's de[MASK]th , and remanded in custody for five weeks . 
 According to a ver[MASK]ict delivered by the Municipal Court in Prague on[MASK]March 5 , 2013 , it was[MASK]p[MASK]oven that Blythe had thrown Nosek offstage and thus had moral responsibility for his death . However , d[MASK]e to the circumstances , Blythe was not held criminally liable , and most of the blame lay with promoters and security members . The acquittal was upheld b[MASK] the Prague High C[MASK]urt on June 5 , 2013 .

 During a concert on May 24 [MASK] 2010[MASK], in the Prague club , Abato[MASK] , Blythe was invo[MASK]ved in an incident that resulted in the death of Daniel Nosek , a 19 @-@ year @-@ old attending fan . According to eyewitness statemen[MASK]s cited by the Czech online daily newspaper aktuálně.cz following Blythe 's arrest , Blythe was chanting " Come on up " between songs , which , the newspape[MASK] stated , may have been intended to invite applause from the aud[MASK]ence and n[MASK]t a direct invitation [MASK]o fans . The newspaper went on to report that the fan tried to climb [MASK]n[MASK]tage and was thrown by the singer from the stage , falling backwards directly on his head . According to the same paper , Nosek was not under the influence o[MASK] drugs[MASK]or alcohol[MASK], suffered serious brain trauma , fell into a coma , and died weeks later from his injuries . 
 A report about the concert at[MASK]issue released on May 26 , 2010 by topzine.cz stated that " one of the things that was unexpected was the behavior of the singer Randall Blythe , w[MASK]o on a few occasions struck some fans in a relatively[MASK]brut[MASK]l way off the stage . " The article also contains pictures , one of them showing Blythe holding a fan down on the ground . Meanwhile , another[MASK]report released two days after the concert by metalopolis.net alleged that " Randy in a totally uncompromising way took down an impertinent fan , who has climbed the podium several times . The front @-@ man clearly showed that it is his te[MASK]ritory , he struck the intruder down , punched him a couple of times and sent him through the air off [MASK]he podium , without even stopping singing ([MASK]! ) " On May 28 , 2010 , t[MASK]e report b[MASK] marastmusic.com stated that " some [MASK]roken head was a testimony to the fact that the band does not like anybody on the stage " , while abysszine.com stated th[MASK]t " the only negative thin[MASK] [MASK]bout the concert was , to say it mildly ,[MASK]disputable approach of the band towards the stage[MASK]@-@ divers ... when somebody t[MASK]ied to climb t[MASK]e stage , he w[MASK]s brutally swept down . " 
 Follow[MASK]ng Blythe 's arrest , Tomáš Fiala , a promoter of the concert , said that there was no fight between the fan and Blythe , and that " it was an unfortunate incident which [MASK]appened during the concert when someone climbed onto the stage whe[MASK]e he was not supposed to be . " According to the Lamb of God publicist Adrenaline[MASK]PR , " [ the ] incident[MASK]deals with a fan that three times [MASK]uring[MASK]the[MASK]c[MASK]ncert jumped the barricade and rushed Randy during the performance . It i[MASK] alleged that the third time , security was not able to reach him and that Randy pushed h[MASK]m back into [MASK]he audience where supposedly he [MASK]ell and hit[MASK]his head . " However , it was[MASK]revealed during the trial [MASK]hat it was a different fan who previously got into contact with Blythe than Nosek . Guitarist Willie Adler said , " I can 't recall that particular show , let alone a fan being beaten on the stage . I think I w[MASK]uld 've noticed somethi[MASK]g like that considering the Dime thing [MASK] " 
 According to Blythe 's attorney Martin Radvan , the police launched an investigati[MASK]n following the death of Nosek , about a month after the concert and following a coma . [MASK]fter in[MASK]erviewing several eyewitnesses from the concert , the police asked the United States Department of Justice to take part in the investigation ; however , they refused to coo[MASK][MASK]rate and , moreover , did not notify anyone from L[MASK]mb of God or its management .

 On June 30 , 2012 , the St[MASK]te Attorney brought a motion to reman[MASK] Blythe in pre @-@ trial detention , as he considered Blythe a flight risk .

After this , the State Attorney had three working days to either accept the bail or to challenge it by f[MASK]ling a complaint . Due to public holidays it was not until July 9 , 2012 , that the State [MASK]ttorney filed his complaint , which was to be deal[MASK] with by appellate court , the Prague Municipal Court . 
 On July 17 , 2012 , Prague Municipal Court 's panel of three judges headed by ju[MASK]ge Luboš Vrba overturned the bail decision by doubling the bail amount to CZK 8 million ( ~ US $ 400 @,@ 000 ) .

Two weeks later , a judge set the trial to commence on February 4 , 2013 , with a[MASK]plan to conduct the hearings in four consecutive days .

 The case was heard by a panel of the Pragu[MASK] Municipal Court , consisting of presiding professional judge Tomáš Kubovec and two[MASK]lay judges[MASK]. Trials in the Czech Republic are public .

A former partner at Baker & McKenzie , Rad[MASK]an established Radvan &[MASK]Co. in 1996 . He [MASK]s also a member of board of directors of Forum 2000 . 
 Jablonský gained fame a[MASK] attorney of Y[MASK]kta Uzunoglu , a Kurdish national who was first charged in 1994 with preparing to commit three murders and [MASK]ommitting blackmail and torture . It became one of the longest cr[MASK]minal cases in the Czech history , as the witnes[MASK]es and alleg[MASK]d victims gradually withdrew or changed their testimonies against Uzunoglu until h[MASK] was exonerated by the Municipal Court in Prague in 2007 . [MASK]he court held that although the crimes did[MASK]take place , there is no evidence that Uzunoglu took part in it . He was also defending judge Pavel Nagy , who was indicted of accepting a bribe . The proceedings ended with Nagy being found insan[MASK] and[MASK]criminally not liable . Jablonský also acted as a defense attorney in the case of a hairdresser of Czech VIPs indicted on [MASK]harge[MASK] of rape and torture . During the procee[MASK]ings , the judge sent Jablonský to fac[MASK] the disciplinary commission of the Czech bar association for what he perceived a[MASK] " beha[MASK]iour bordering on contempt " .

 The trial started on February 4 , 2013 . Blythe testified that when [MASK]e wanted to see the club before the concert , La[MASK]b of God 's technician told him[MASK]that the club was terrible and messy . According to Blythe , the technician went on , saying that the stage was [MASK]mall ,[MASK]there were too many people , and that it was rather danger[MASK]us . 
 Blythe , who is nearsighted , took off his glasses be[MASK]ore entering th[MASK] stage , which together with the smoke and light effects allegedly left him half @-@ blind . Blythe said[MASK]that people co[MASK]ld easily reach the band members or climb up [MASK]o [MASK]he stage . One of the fans , who was identified as Milan Pořádek by Czech newspapers , and who w[MASK]s scheduled to testify la[MASK]er during the proceedings , managed to[MASK]climb the stage twice without being stopped by security . Blythe testified that during t[MASK]e first attempt , Pořádek rushed the stage and started waving [MASK]is arms before stage diving . The second time , he tried to put his arms around Blythe in an attempt to h[MASK]g him[MASK]. Blythe , who according to his own words perceived this as a danger , caught Pořádek 's collar , pushed him on the ground , knelt on him and repeatedly told him to stop . He then led the fan by his hair to the[MASK]edge of the stage , where the fan jumped off . It was only after watching a video of the incident that Blythe found out that a se[MASK]urity officer [MASK]as actually pushing the fan from back . Blythe[MASK]fur[MASK]her said that he saw Pořádek trying to reach the stage yet again before finally being stopped by security . 
 Later , when another fan tried to climb the stage , Blythe thought that[MASK]it was Pořádek again . Blythe testified that he approached the fan and pushe[MASK] him with both hands out of the stage in the belief that the crowd would catch him , which [MASK]t did not . Jiří Choroš , author of video which caught the previous incidents with Pořádek , testified that the fan was for a moment lying on th[MASK] ground with nobody helping him . Blythe further commented that he[MASK]saw the fan get up and that other fans showed him thumbs up . Blythe i[MASK]sisted that he never saw Nosek nor came into contact[MASK]with him . It was not un[MASK]il the a[MASK]rest two years later that he found out about Nosek 's death [MASK] 
 Blythe further testified that he was not under the influence of alcohol during the concert and that he had never used any dr[MASK]gs . Ch[MASK]is Adler ,[MASK]Lamb of God 's drummer , testified that he had not seen anything from the back of the stage and further proclaimed that Blythe 's aggressiveness is only a stage act . According to Adler , Blythe is a calm , mode[MASK]ate , and well @-@ r[MASK]ad perso[MASK] . The defense also p[MASK]esented videos fr[MASK]m various Lamb of God concerts in order to demonstrate that metal music is very energetic and that Blythe regularly cheers to the crowd , but[MASK]not to encourage people to climb th[MASK] stage . 
 Blythe also alleged that after learning about Nosek 's death , he had written a letter to the Nosek family , in which he offered help and a meeting in @-@ person .[MASK]Daniel Nosek[MASK]'s father , however , testified that the family has not been contacted by anyone from the band nor by the defense[MASK]team . Nosek 's father confirmed that his son had been healthy[MASK]up until the day of the [MASK]ncident . The Nosek family 's repr[MASK]sentative brought a claim for damages in the amount of CZK 10 @[MASK]@ 000 @,@ 000 ( approx[MASK]. US $ 530 @,@ 000 ) .

[MASK]
 Altogether , eight witnesses del[MASK]vered their testimonies on February 5 , 2013 . Among them were friends of Daniel Nosek . Nosek and three friends had come to attend[MASK]the concert from Vrchlabí , a town in mountains some 130 kilometres ( 81 mi ) nort[MASK]west of Prague . They described Nosek as a huge fan of Lamb of God who had been able to secure an autograph from a guitar player before the concert had started . 
 Nosek 's friend Jan Jebavý testified that[MASK]Nosek climbed[MASK]the stage , and as he turned around to[MASK]ards the crowd he was pushed by Blythe off the st[MASK]ge . He said he was " 100 % sure Blythe pushed Nosek with both hands . " He further said that Blythe 's behavior devia[MASK]ed from all the concerts he had attended in the p[MASK]st , commenting that Blythe was visibly furious . He further claimed that Nosek was not the first person to be chased off the stage by Blythe , with [MASK]nother fan being k[MASK]cked , choked and receiving a punch from Blythe . Jebavý corrobo[MASK]ated Blythe 's testimony that Blythe asked " Ar[MASK] you okay ? " after Nosek fell an[MASK] that the crowd g[MASK]ve him a positive reply . However , as Nosek fell s[MASK]ck after the concert , they called him an ambulance . Ac[MASK]ording to Jebavý , the band had not warned the fans against getting on stage and the security guards did not pay much attention to it [MASK] 
 Nosek 's other friend Ondře[MASK] Vlach testified that Nosek 's fall happened in a [MASK]reak between the end of concert an[MASK] the encore . No[MASK]ek climbed the stage together with another fan as the band members were leaving to [MASK]o backstage . According to him , Blythe ran into the two[MASK]fans and pushed them [MASK]oth off . While the other fan was caught by a couple of fans remainin[MASK] under the stage , Nosek fell di[MASK]ectly[MASK]on the ground . Acco[MASK]ding [MASK]o Vlach , there wer[MASK] fewer fans in front of the stage due[MASK]to the break[MASK]. Vlach furth[MASK]r testified that after the fall , [MASK]osek we[MASK]t to [MASK]it on a bench , where he was fetched a water bottle . Nosek began vomiting about half an h[MASK]ur after t[MASK]e fall and as[MASK]his f[MASK]iends rea[MASK]ized that he[MASK]had a bulge at the back of his [MASK]ead , they cal[MASK]ed an ambulance for fear[MASK]he might have a concussion . Vlac[MASK] said that he un[MASK]erstood Bly[MASK]he 's gestur[MASK] in the b[MASK]eak as an invitation to the stage . 
 A[MASK]other perso[MASK] to testify was[MASK]Robert Havelka , who worked[MASK]as a security guard[MASK]the night of the inciden[MASK] . Havelka [MASK]aid that the [MASK]uardrail was too close to the stage[MASK], but n[MASK]t so close as[MASK]to make a platform for climbing the stage . He testified that he pulled one person off the stage and that anoth[MASK]r person fell off before he could be secu[MASK]ed . He further [MASK]aid that the fan 's fall might have been helped by someone else , perhaps the singer , though he did not see it precisely . 
 Blythe 's defense team attacked differences between the testimonies th[MASK] witnesses gave after the incident in 2010 and at the court . Among other things , one of the witness[MASK]s originally alleged that Nosek and Blythe shook hands or that one of them o[MASK]fered hand to a[MASK]other on stage ; however , at the court hear[MASK]ng , he testified that there was no prior contact between them . Blyt[MASK]e also argued that vi[MASK]eo evidence[MASK]shown in court refuted claims ab[MASK]ut[MASK]his aggressive behavior . 
 
 = = [MASK] Day 3 of the trial = = = 
 
 Milan Pořádek , the fan whom Blythe admitted to shoving off the stage , testified on the third day of the [MASK]rial . Pořádek said h[MASK] climbed the stage twice in order to stage dive ; he changed his min[MASK] during the third attempt to get on stage . Pořádek testified that Blythe knocked him down , kn[MASK]lt on him and held him down for a moment [MASK] but Blythe definitely did not choke him . He also admitted that taking [MASK]nto account the fact that he ( Pořádek ) was[MASK]drunk and the way he acted , Blythe 's reaction was adequate . He commented that he grasped the fact that he was not wanted on stage . 
 Another witness who had attended the concert at the[MASK]rear of the crowd testif[MASK]ed that Blythe 's behavior was standard to metal concerts , saying that metal bands always put on angry and tough acts and the concert at issue was no exception . She said that it was evident that Blythe did not want any fans on the stage . Neither the tw[MASK] nor any other witne[MASK]s who took the stand [MASK]hat day gave a testimony as to[MASK]the moment of Nosek 's fall at the[MASK]end of the concert . 
 Th[MASK] judge also read a sworn statement from Abaton 's former producer , who stated th[MASK]t she had [MASK]ot known about the incident[MASK]. She was aware that an ambulance was called that evening , but learned about[MASK]the[MASK]reasons for that only later , duri[MASK]g the police investigation . The court further heard that Lamb of God had sent a list of security deman[MASK]s to the concert venue , including that barriers should be placed 1 @.@ 5 metre[MASK] ( 4 @.@ 9 ft ) from the stage . Pr[MASK]moter Tomáš Fiala testified that although this was not the case , the band had not expresse[MASK] any concerns to him either before or after the concert . 
 Randy Blythe was [MASK]alled again to the stand that day . The jud[MASK]e first alerted hi[MASK] that he had the right to remain silent and can deny answering his questions . The judge went again through the Blythe 's te[MASK]timony and , with a view to the previous witness statements , asked [MASK]lythe whether he insi[MASK]ts that [MASK]t was Milan P[MASK]řádek whom Blythe threw off th[MASK] stag[MASK] . Blythe res[MASK]onded [MASK]y[MASK]saying : " To the be[MASK]t [MASK]f my knowledge , it was Milan Pořádek who w[MASK]s coming up [ on stage ] every time . " 
 Also tha[MASK] day , expert medical witness Michal Pogoši took the stand . According to The Prague Post , Pogoši testified that Nosek 's cause of death wa[MASK] pneumonia resulting from a blow to the brainstem . Pogoši added that the " mortality rate from thi[MASK] kind of inju[MASK]y is around 40 percent , and that doctors couldn 't have done more to save the patient . "[MASK]Nosek was initially taken to a [MASK]earby hospital less than a kilometer from the [MASK]enue , where the initial diagn[MASK]sis took place . Since this hospital did not have a spe[MASK]ialized neurology department , Nosek was transferred to another hospital after the diagnosis . There , Nosek underwent two operations , first to tend to [MASK]he injury and second to reduce pressure on brain by removing[MASK]some bone . 
 Finally , defense asked f[MASK]r adjournment as a key witness [MASK]ell ill . The court decided to continue with the hearings the next day , after which the hearin[MASK]s would be adjourned until March 4 , 2013 , in order to hear the defense 's witness . Blythe co[MASK]mitted to retur[MASK] when the trial resumed . 
 
 = = = Day 4 of the trial = = = 
 
 On Febru[MASK]ry 7 , 2013 , only one witness took the s[MASK]and before the hearing was adjourned . Lukáš Havlena contacted the defense af[MASK]er reading about the trial in news[MASK]apers because he " didn 't like the description of the situation " by the previous w[MASK]tnesses . He [MASK]aid he did not think Blythe was aggressive that night , and that fans should realize any aggressive behavior displayed onstage is just part of the show . He also sa[MASK]d[MASK]that each time somebody g[MASK]t on the stage , Blythe demonstrated that they were not allowed there . Havlena testified that he saw how a fan tried to reach the stage three times and that as he was preparing to stage dive [MASK] somebody aid[MASK]d his fall from[MASK]behind . He[MASK]had not seen anybody fall directly on the ground . Havlena had trouble recalling details from the[MASK]show , as he had visited multiple concerts on other dates in Abaton , and thus could not descri[MASK]e , among other things[MASK], the position of the [MASK]uardrail . 
 
 = = = Day 5 of the trial = = = 
 
 The trial resumed on March 4 , 2013 with testimonies from expert witn[MASK]sses in the fields of criminal psychology ( Tereza Soukupová , appointed by the court ) and psychiatry ( Alena Gayová , appointed by the defense ) . Blythe returned to attend the hearin[MASK]s in person , even though the presiding judge had[MASK]told him that at this point they may be undertaken in his absence . T[MASK]e two expert witnesses agreed that Blythe[MASK][MASK]s not aggressive ; nevertheless , he[MASK]may have issues with controlling his emotions under stress . The court further heard testimonies from two eyewitnesses . [MASK]ne[MASK]of them was a bodyguard who wa[MASK] present at the concert but did not see the fall . He testified [MASK]hat when by the exit , he saw two men tak[MASK]ng a third man out of the building to fresh air .[MASK]He said that he was told by them that the person [MASK]ell off the stage . The[MASK]ambulance ar[MASK]ived 5 – 10 minutes later . 
 Another eyewitness was a fan , [MASK]lena Rozsíval[MASK]vá , who testified that she saw[MASK]Blythe s[MASK]ove Nosek , saying " [ h [MASK] e climbed onto the stage , and when he tried to stand up , Blythe shoved him . " According to her , the shove was strong enough for Nosek to fall behind the front row of the fans into a place where no[MASK]fans were staying at the [MASK]oment . Sh[MASK] testified that Nosek fell backwards . Anot[MASK]er attendee of [MASK]he concer[MASK] who took the stand tha[MASK] day did not[MASK]recall seeing any fall by the end[MASK]of the concert . 
 
 = = = Day 6 of the trial = = = 
 
 A [MASK]efense @-@ appointed expert witness in the field of biomechanics testified on Mar[MASK]h 5 that Nosek co[MASK]ld not turn 180 degrees during the fall and that should he be falling for[MASK]ard , he could not have sustained an i[MASK]jury to the back of his head . He further[MASK]said that if Nosek fell over the first row of the fans , he must have been not only pushed , but must have jumped himself . The State Attorney im[MASK]ed[MASK]ately attacked this testimon[MASK] , cla[MASK]ming that the expert witnes[MASK] omitted the conditions at the place and [MASK]ime , as well as som[MASK] of the eyewitness testimonies , according to which Nosek[MASK]fell onto hi[MASK] back [MASK]rom the beginning a[MASK]d did not turn during the fall . The presiding judge agreed with the State Attorney on some of his points . 
 In his closing speech , the State Attorney asked t[MASK]e court to incarcerate Blythe for 5 [MASK]ears , claiming that " even children in the kindergarten a[MASK]e aware [MASK]ha[MASK] a fall from height may lead to an injury . " 
 A Nosek family representative said[MASK]t[MASK]at b[MASK]sed on the witness testimon[MASK]es , the family did not believe that Blythe was solely responsible . He c[MASK]ntinued that he would not be substantiating the requested amount , as no money c[MASK]uld replace the loss the family [MASK]as suffered . He further added that Daniel had died[MASK]on his father 's [MASK]irthday , and his mother has consequently become a psychiatry pat[MASK]ent unable to work . 
 In his closing word , Blythe said that he did not wish to avoid any responsibility and that if he felt guilty he woul[MASK] have pleaded so . He further commented that in case of acquittal [MASK] measures would be undertaken to avoid anythin[MASK] similar from hap[MASK]ening at Lamb of God concerts again . [MASK] 
 = = = First instance verdict = = = 
 
 On [MASK]arch 5 , 2013 , the court delivered a verdict , according to which Blythe was not criminally liable for Nosek 's death , even though he had the moral responsibility for it . Consequently , the court dismi[MASK]sed the d[MASK]mages claim and ordered t[MASK]e return of Blythe 's b[MASK]il . 
 T[MASK]e court held that it was proven that Blythe had thr[MASK]wn Nosek off the stage . Howev[MASK]r , Blythe , due to his nearsightedness , cou[MASK]d have mistaken[MASK]Nosek for the other fan[MASK]who had repeatedly gotten over the guardrail . According to the court , the largest part of the blame lies[MASK]with the promoters and security members . Judge Kubovec further reproached Blythe f[MASK]r not having met with the Nosek family . 
 The State Attorney announced that he would appeal the verdict [MASK] 
 
 = = = Appeals verdict = = = 
 
[MASK]The State Atto[MASK]ney 's appeal was heard[MASK]by a panel[MASK]of three judges of the Prague High Court , chaired by judge Jiří Lněnička . The hearing took place in Blythe 's absence . Blythe 's acquittal was upheld by the panel on June 5 , 2013 . 
 The verdict may have been a[MASK]pealed by the Supreme State Attorn[MASK]y ( SSA [MASK] to the Supreme Court . As the appeal hasn 't been lodged by SS[MASK] within two months of the delivery of written second instance verdict , it has become final . 
 In 2015 Blythe demanded ca CZK 15 millions for damages but the Municipa[MASK] Court for[MASK]Prague 2 dismissed the suit .

 In reaction to the arrest and detention ,[MASK]a fan created a petition at the official White House pet[MASK]tion site . By the ti[MASK]e Blythe was released on bail , it gathered over 27 @,@ 5[MASK]0 signatures . 
 [MASK]n July 7 , 2012 , there w[MASK]s a vigi[MASK] organized in Lamb of God 's h[MASK]metown of Richmond , Virgin[MASK]a , by[MASK]a f[MASK]iend [MASK]f Blythe 's . At t[MASK]e event , Gwar ( who are also from Richmond [MASK] frontman Dave Brockie said : “ I don ’[MASK]t think it was right for him to be arrested . I don ’ t think it was right for him to be locked up .... This stuff could have all [MASK]een work[MASK]d out diplomatically or legally before h[MASK] got there . ” In additio[MASK] to Brockie , other notable figures in hea[MASK]y [MASK]etal , such as Tom Araya and David Draiman , have also come out in support of Blythe . 
 In a post to his blog , Blythe[MASK]explained that he met the Nosek family [MASK]n[MASK]private after the tri[MASK]l , a[MASK]d promised the[MASK] to[MASK]be " a spokesperson[MASK]for safer shows " . He emphasized that the family never attacked him a[MASK]d " just[MASK]wanted to kn[MASK]w the truth of what had happened to their s[MASK]n " .

 US Hig[MASK][MASK]ay 2 ( US 2 ) is a component of the United States Numbered Highway System that connects Everett , Washing[MASK]on , to the Upper Peninsula ( UP ) o[MASK] the US state of Michigan , with a separ[MASK]te se[MASK]ment that runs from Rouses Point , [MASK]ew York , to Hoult[MASK]n , M[MASK]ine . In Michigan , the highway runs through the UP in two segments as a part of the state trunkline highway system , entering[MASK]the state at Ironwood and ending at St. Ignace [MASK] in betw[MASK]en , US 2 briefly traverses the state of Wisconsin . [MASK]s one of the major transportation arteries in the UP , US 2 is a major conduit for traffic through the state and neighboring no[MASK]thern Midwest states . Two sections of the roadway are included as part of the Great Lakes Circle Tours , and o[MASK]her segmen[MASK]s are listed as [MASK]tate @-@ designated Pure Michigan Byways . There are several memorial highway designations and historic bridges along US 2 t[MASK]at date to the 1910s and[MASK]1920s . The highway runs through rural sections of the UP , passing through two national and two state[MASK]f[MASK]rests [MASK]n the p[MASK]ocess . 
 The route of what became US 2 was used as part of two Indian trails before European settlers came to the UP , and as part of the Michigan segmen[MASK]s of the Theodore Roosevelt International Highway and the King 's International Highway auto trails in the early 20th century . The state later included these trails as part of M ‑ [MASK]2 when the first state highway trunklines were designated[MASK]in [MASK][MASK]19 . Most of M ‑ 12 wa[MASK] redesigna[MASK]ed as part of US 2[MASK]when the US Highway System was created on Novemb[MASK]r 11 , 1926 . Since the 1930s , several changes have[MASK]reshaped the highway 's routing through the UP . One such alteration eventually created [MASK] business loop that connected across the state line with Hurley , Wisconsin , and others pushed an originally inland routing of US 2 closer to the Lake Michigan shoreline . With the creation[MASK]of the Interstate Highway System , pa[MASK]t of US 2 [MASK]as rerouted to coincide with t[MASK]e new I[MASK]terstate[MASK]75 ( I ‑ 75 ) , though in the 1980s , th[MASK] U[MASK]S.[MASK]Highway [MASK]as truncate[MASK] and removed from [MASK]he I ‑ 75 freeway , resulting in today 's basic form .

 Acco[MASK]ding [MASK]o a 2006 regional planning committe[MASK] report , US 2 is a key highway for Michigan , providing its main western gateway . The roadway plays " an important role in the transportation of goods across the northern ti[MASK]r of states in the Midwest " , and is listed o[MASK][MASK]the Nat[MASK]onal Highway System ([MASK]NHS ) for its entire leng[MASK]h . The NHS is a network of roadways important to the country 's economy , defense , and mobility . Together with M ‑ 28 , US 2 is part of a pair of primary trunklines that bridge the eastern and western sides of the UP . Th[MASK] 305 @.@ 151 mile[MASK] ( 491 @.@ 093 km ) o[MASK] roadway in Michigan is divided into a 109 @.@ 177 [MASK]-@ mile ( 175 @.@ 703 km ) western segment and a 195 @.@ 97[MASK][MASK]@-@ mile ( 315 @.@ 390 km ) eastern segment , interr[MASK]pted by a section that runs for 14 @.@ 460 miles ( 23 @.@ 271 km ) in the state of Wisconsin .

 US 2 enters Michigan from Wisconsin for the [MASK]irst time north of downtown Hurley , Wisconsin , and Ironwood , Michigan , over the state line that runs along the Montreal River . The highway [MASK]rosses the river into [MASK]ogebic County and passes a welcome ce[MASK]ter on the way into a c[MASK]mmercial distr[MASK]ct north of downtown . Running along Clov[MASK]rland Drive , US 2 meets its[MASK]only business route in Michigan at D[MASK]uglas Boule[MASK]ard . The business[MASK]route was pr[MASK]viously a full loop that ran west through downtown Ironwood and crossed the border into Hurley and back to the main highway . The Wisconsin Department of Transportation has removed [MASK]he signage on their [MASK]ide of the border , which reduced the loop to a[MASK]business spur that ends at the state line . US 2 continues eastward through UP woodlands to the city of Bessemer . While bypassing the community of Ramsay , the highway crosses a branch of the Black River . The roadway enters Wakefi[MASK]ld on the south[MASK]side of Sunday Lake , meeting M ‑ 28 at a stoplight in tow[MASK] . As the US Highway leaves Wakefield , it turns southeasterly through the Ottawa National Forest , cros[MASK]ing Jackson Creek and two branches of the Presq[MASK]e Isle River . US[MASK]2 and M ‑ 64 merge and run concurrently over the secon[MASK] branch of the Presque Isle in the community of Marenisco . This concurre[MASK]cy has the lowest traffic volume along the entir[MASK] length of the highway within the state ; in 2010 the Michigan Department of Transportation ( MDOT ) recorded a daily average usage along the stretch of 770 vehicles , compared [MASK]o the overall average [MASK]f 5 @,@ 188 vehicles for the highway . At the end of the concurrency , M ‑ 64 turns northerly to run along Lake Gogebic . 
 The highway continues parallel [MASK]o[MASK]t[MASK]e state line f[MASK]om th[MASK] Marensico area through the national forest toward Watersme[MASK]t . That unincorporated community is[MASK]the home of the Watersmeet High School Nimrods , the bas[MASK]etball team featured on a series of ESPN commercials and a documentary series on the Sundan[MASK]e Channel . The area is also w[MASK]ere the [MASK]aters meet ; the rolling hills drain to Lake Superior via the Ontona[MASK]on Riv[MASK]r , to Lake Michigan via the Brule and Menominee rivers , or to the Gulf of Mexico via the Wisconsin and Mississippi rivers . Al[MASK]o located in the area are the Sylvania Wilderness , and the Lac Vieux Desert In[MASK]ian Reservation , which includes the Lac Vieux Desert Casino and Resort . The highway tr[MASK]vels southeasterly from Watersmeet around the many lakes and streams in the area and crosses into rural Iron County . US 2 intersects Federal Forest Highway 16 ( FFH 16 ) near Golden Lake in Stambaugh Township in the middle of the national forest . The [MASK]runkline then runs along the Iron River as i[MASK] approaches the city of the sam[MASK] name and meets M ‑ 73 . In town[MASK], US 2 intersects M ‑ 189 before crossing the river and turning northeast out of[MASK]the city .[MASK]
 US 2 leav[MASK]s the Ottawa[MASK]National F[MASK]rest at Iron River , and the highway continues eastward through forest lands near [MASK]everal small lakes to Crystal Falls , the county seat of Iron County . On the west side of town , US 2 meets US 141 ; [MASK]he two[MASK]highways run concu[MASK]rently along Crystal Avenue . The combined highway turns south onto 5th[MASK]Street and meets M ‑ 69 's eastern terminus at the interse[MASK][MASK]ion between 5th Street an[MASK] Superior Avenue nex[MASK] to the county courthouse at the top of the hill . US 2 / US 141 runs south out of [MASK]rystal Falls to the west of , and parallel to , the Paint River .

 US 2 / US 141 re @-@ enters Michigan [MASK]here it crosses the Menominee River and subsequently meets M ‑[MASK]95 in Breitung Township north of I[MASK]on Mountain and Kingsford . The highways merge in a triple concurrency and run south on Stephenson Avenue into [MASK]ron Mountain along the west side of Lake Antoine , parallel to a b[MASK]anch line of the Escanaba and Lake Superior Railroad ( ELS Railroad ) . The road crosses through a retail corridor[MASK]and over a[MASK]flooded pit of the Chapin Mine . In downtown Iron[MASK]Mountain at Ludin[MASK]to[MASK] [MASK]treet [MASK] M ‑ 95 turns west off Stephenson Avenue to run across town to Kingsford .

The trunkline runs alon[MASK] the main street of Norway , where the highway meets the eastern terminus of US 8 .[MASK]Then US 2 co[MASK]tin[MASK]es east through rural Dickinson County to Vulcan , passing north [MASK]f Hanbury Lake through the Copper Count[MASK]y State Forest , before crossing the Sturgeon River in Loretto and passing into Menominee County . 
 In Menominee County , the environment takes on a more agricultural character along US 2 . The highway passes through th[MASK] edge[MASK]of the community of Hermansville before entering Powers[MASK]. US 2 comes to a three @-@ way intersection and turns northeast merging onto US 41 .

 US 2 / US 41 widens to four lanes[MASK]along Ludington Street ,[MASK]which forms the [MASK]ast – west axis of the Escanaba s[MASK]reet grid . Nea[MASK] downtown , the highway meets M ‑ 35 [MASK] which runs along the city 's north – south axis , Lincoln Avenue . The trunklines merge and run north , bypassing the traditional central business distric[MASK] for a different business corri[MASK]or . Lincoln [MASK]venue runs north carryin[MASK] four lanes of traffic past the Upper Peninsula State Fairgrounds , site[MASK]of one of th[MASK] two state fairs for the state of Michigan , the only[MASK]state to have twin fairs . US 2 / US 41 / M ‑ 35 continues north on Lincoln Avenue past the campus of Bay de Noc Community College . The four @-@ lane highway crosses the Escanaba River just upstream from its mouth near the large Mead Pap[MASK]r Mill [MASK]nd shifts to run immediately next to Little Bay de Noc . The section h[MASK]re ca[MASK]ried the highest traffic counts along all of US 2 in the state : an average of 23 @,@ 977 vehicles used this segment of roadway daily in 2011 . 
 The road turns inland again , [MASK]nd US 2 / U[MASK] 41 / M ‑ 35 passes to the west of downtown Gladstone . The highway through here is an expressway , four lanes divided by a central median[MASK]and no driveway access [MASK] Unlike a freeway , the expressway has standard intersections and not interchanges . The highway intersects the eastern terminus of County Road 426 ( CR 426 ) [MASK]nd crosses the ELS Rai[MASK]road south of the stoplight for 4th Avenue North , where M ‑ 35 separates from[MASK]the US Highways and turns to the n[MASK]rthwest . The expressway continu[MASK]s north parallel to the CN Railway , crossing the Days River . Through this area , the trunkline carries a speed limit of 6[MASK] mph ( [MASK]05 km / h ) for car traffic . This is the only road in the UP with a speed limit higher than 55[MASK]mph ( 89 km / h ) besides I @-@ 75 ,[MASK]which has a speed limit of 70 mph ( 11[MASK] km / h ) . The expressway [MASK][MASK]gment runs around the upper end of Little Bay de Noc before ending at Rapid River . In this [MASK]ocation , US 41 separates[MASK]to the nor[MASK][MASK] , and US 2 retu[MASK]ns to an easterly track as a two @-@ lane[MASK]road , crossing the Rapid and Whitefish rivers and turning southeast around the head of the bay . As US 2 crosses southern Delta County , it passes through the western unit of the Hiawatha National [MASK]orest . Near Garden C[MASK]rners , the highway runs along the shore of Big Bay de Noc . Af[MASK]er the intersection with the northern terminus of M ‑ 183 , US 2 turns inland cutting across the base of the Garden Peninsula and enters School[MASK]raft County . 
 As the highway approaches Thompson , US 2 [MASK][MASK]aves the western unit of the Hiawat[MASK]a National Forest and ente[MASK]s the Lake Superior State Forest . The road[MASK]ay runs along Lake Michigan to Manistique , crossing the Manist[MASK]que[MASK]River . The trunkline turns inland app[MASK]oaching Gulliver and then turns north @-@ northeast to[MASK]Blaney Park . The community there is a former logging town @-@ turned @[MASK]@ resort at t[MASK]e southern terminus of M ‑ 77 [MASK] the resor[MASK] was a[MASK]tive from the late 1920s but declined by the 198[MASK]s . From Blaney Park[MASK], US 2 turns due east and crosses into Mackinac County west of Gould City [MASK] W[MASK]ere it intersects a former routing , the main highway crosses the CN Railway one last time and runs to the south [MASK]f Engadine to follow the Lake Michigan shor[MASK]line through Naubinway . After passing the community of Epoufette , US 2 crosses the Cut Ri[MASK]er Bridge , 147 feet ( 45 m ) over the [MASK]ut[MASK]River . The highway crosses into the eastern unit of the Hiawath[MASK] National Forest near Brevort , running between Lake Michigan and Br[MASK]vort Lake in the pro[MASK]e[MASK]s . The road contin[MASK]es along the [MASK]ake Michigan shoreline , passing Mystery Sp[MASK]t near Gros Cap and turning inland immediately west of St. Ignace . The US 2 [MASK]esignati[MASK]n ends at the[MASK]highway 's partial cloverleaf interchange with I ‑ 75[MASK]. The roadway continues easterly into downtown St. Ignace as Business Loop I ‑ 75 ( BL I ‑ 75 ) .

 In 1701 , the first trans[MASK]ortation routes through what became the [MASK]tate of Mic[MASK]igan were the lakes , river[MASK] and Indian trails . Two of these trails followed parts of the future US 2 . The[MASK]Sault – Green Bay Trail roughly followed the Lake Michigan shoreline[MASK]routing of US 2 between Escanaba and St. Ignace . The Mackinac T[MASK]ail connected St. Ignace with Sault Ste . Marie . 
 In the age of the auto trail , the roads that[MASK]later formed US 2 through the UP were given a few different highway names . When the or[MASK]ginal roadways betwee[MASK] [MASK]ronwood and Iron River were completed in late 1915 , the Upper Peninsula Develo[MASK]ment Bureau ( UPDB ) named the area Cloverland and the highway the Cloverland [MASK]rail . Later the name w[MASK]s extended ove[MASK] th[MASK] high[MASK]ay to Escanaba , and [MASK]o all highways in the area in the early 1920s ; the name was phased out by the UPDB completely in 1927 . The roadways were also used for the Theodore Roosevelt International Highway , named for for[MASK]er US president Theodore Roosevelt after his death in 1919 .[MASK][MASK]vera[MASK]l , this highway [MASK]an from Portland , Oregon , t[MASK] Portland , Maine , by way of Mi[MASK]higan and the Canadian province of Ontar[MASK]o . Through the UP , the southern branch followed the immediate predecessors [MASK]o US 2 , including the section through Florence [MASK]ounty , Wisconsin . 
 The Great Lakes Automobile Route was [MASK]stablished in 1917 by the UPDB . A predecessor of the Great L[MASK]kes Circ[MASK]e Tours by[MASK]seventy years , the route followed " a circular journe[MASK] along the banks of lakes Michigan and Superior and Green Bay ... " This route followed the modern US 2 from Ironwood to the M ‑ 94 junction in Manistique , using the modern M ‑ 69 and M ‑ [MASK]5 to sta[MASK] in Michigan . Bran[MASK]hes of the route followed US 41 and [MASK] ‑ 35 between Powers and Escanaba . The route was originall[MASK] intended to entice motorists to drive around Lake Michigan .[MASK]The name fell out of use before its first anniversary because o[MASK] World War I. 
 One Canadian auto tr[MASK]il was routed through the UP as well . In 1920 , the[MASK]King 's International Highway linked [MASK]ancouver[MASK], British Columbia , to Halifax , Nova Scotia , bu[MASK] there was no highway to carry it around the north side of Lake Superior . Motorists h[MASK]d to shi[MASK] their cars by boat between Sault Ste . Marie ,[MASK]Ontario , and Thunder Bay or enter the United States to continue along the auto trai[MASK] . The routings vari[MASK]d on the maps of the time , bu[MASK] its basic route used US 2 through [MASK]he UP from Ironwood to Sault Ste . Marie until a highway north [MASK]f Lake Superior was opened[MASK]in 1960 ; by that time , the auto trail had taken on the Trans @-@ C[MASK]nada Highway name . 
 
 = = = State trunkline = = = 
 
 The first [MASK][MASK]ate trunkline highway designated along the path of the modern US 2 was M ‑ 12 , a designation that was in use by July 1 , 1919 , between Ironwood and Sault Ste . Marie . The first roadside park in the country was created by Herbert Larson nea[MASK] what is[MASK]now US 2 n[MASK]ar Iron Rive[MASK] in[MASK]1919 – 20 , although other sour[MASK]es state that the first was a picnic table alongside US 16 ( [MASK]rand River Avenue ) in 1929 south of Saranac . When the US High[MASK]ay System was c[MASK]eated on November 11 , 1926 ,[MASK]US 2 partially replaced [MASK] @-@ 1[MASK] . Between Crystal Falls and Iron Mounta[MASK]n , US 2 was routed thro[MASK]gh Florence , Wisconsin . The former routi[MASK]g of M ‑ 12 from Crystal Falls to Sagola became a new M ‑ 69 when the former M ‑ 69 became [MASK]S 102 [MASK] now U[MASK] 141 ) . M ‑ 12[MASK]from[MASK]Sagola south to Iron Mountain was made[MASK]a part of an extended M [MASK] 45 , which is now M ‑ 95 . By the next year , M ‑ 48 was added al[MASK][MASK]g US 2 from Rexton to Garnet as part of a larger extension . 
 The first changes to the routing of US 2 itself were ma[MASK]e in[MASK]1930 with a bypass of downtown Escanaba . A larger rerouting was completed in 1933 between Rogers Park an[MASK] Sault Ste . Marie . The new ro[MASK]ting followed Mackinac Trail[MASK]instead of turn[MASK]ng east to Cedarville and north to Sault Ste . Marie ; the former routing[MASK]was given the M[MASK]‑ 121 designat[MASK]on . Another realignment in the Iron Mountain area shifted US 2 / US 141 to a new bridge over the Menomine[MASK] River between[MASK]1932 and 1934 . Downtown Ironwood was bypassed in [MASK]934 , and the former route was initially designated M ‑ 54 . 
 The Michigan State Highway Departme[MASK]t ( MSHD ) changed the routin[MASK]s and designations o[MASK] the highways around Cooks , Thompson and Manisti[MASK][MASK]e in the mid @-@ 1930s . The agency rerouted [MASK]S 2 between Cooks and M ‑ 149 in Thompson , turning the old [MASK]oad back to county control . The section [MASK]etween M ‑ 149 and M ‑ 125 was redesignated as an extension of M ‑ 149 to Thompson , and M ‑ 125 was replaced by a further extension of M ‑ 149 . The las[MASK] change was to route US 2 along its current alignment in the area , completing the changes on August 2 , 1936 . 
 The MSH[MASK] started construction in 1936 on a new r[MASK]ad that rerouted US 2 into St. Ignace for the first time . Between Brevort and Moran , US 2 previously followed Wort[MASK] Road inland to the Tahquamenon Trail to meet the northern extension of US 31 into the Upper Peninsula . The new routing took US 2 along the lakeshore into St. Ignace .[MASK]US 31[MASK]was trunc[MASK]te[MASK] to the sta[MASK]e ferry docks in Macki[MASK]aw City an[MASK] US 2 was routed through St. Ignace along th[MASK] former US 31 to Rogers Park ; the[MASK]connection in [MASK]t. Ignace to the stat[MASK] ferry docks b[MASK]came M ‑ 122 . Furthe[MASK] changes in the early 1940s straighten[MASK]d the roadway ou[MASK] near Watersmeet and Cr[MASK]stal Falls . 
 Additional realignments were completed by the MSHD t[MASK] move US 2 to its modern lakeshore routing between Gould City and Epoufette in 1941 . The ne[MASK] highway [MASK]raveled due east from Gould City to Naubinway and then along the lake to Epoufette . The former[MASK]route through Engadine was turned back to local control as far east as Garnet . From there east , it was numbered just M ‑ 48 , removing US 2 from a concurrency . Another former section into Epoufette was added to extend M ‑ 117 . The new highway was detoured around the [MASK]ut River Bridge until it was completed in 1946 after construction delays over steel shortages dur[MASK]ng World War II . 
 The western end of US 2[MASK]took on two[MASK]changes in the 1940s . M ‑ 28 was extended along US 2 to the state line at Ironwood from its western terminus at Wakef[MASK]eld . A similar extension was made from M ‑ 28 's east[MASK]rn terminus to Sault Ste . Marie in 1948 . The M ‑ 54 designation was renumbered as Business US 2 by 1945 . The eastern M ‑ 28 extension was reversed in 1950 , and the western extension [MASK]o the state line was shifted to a new locat[MASK]on by 1952 . 
 
 = = = Interstate era = = = 
 
 With the coming of t[MASK]e Interstate Highway System in Michigan , the MSHD planned to convert the eastern section of US 2 to a freeway between St. [MASK]gna[MASK]e and Sault St. Marie . In planning maps from 1947 , this highway co[MASK]ridor was included i[MASK] the syst[MASK]m that later became the Interstates . It was also included in the Gene[MASK]al Locat[MASK]on of National System of Interstate Highw[MASK]ys Including All Additio[MASK]al Routes at Urban Areas Designa[MASK]ed in September 1955 , or Yellow[MASK]Book after the cover color , that was released in 1955 as the federal government readied plans for the freeway system . The propo[MASK]ed number in 1958 was Interstate 75 ( I ‑ 75 ) . 
 The first section of freeway was built in late 1957 or early 1958 between Evergre[MASK]n Shores and M ‑ 123 north of St. I[MASK]nace . The Mack[MASK]nac Bridge was opened to traffic on November 1 , 1957 ; a new section [MASK]f freeway and an interchange connected US 2 to the bridge . In 1961 , an[MASK]the[MASK] new freeway segment closed the gap between the[MASK]Mackinac Brid[MASK]e and Evergreen [MASK]hores section[MASK] . At the time , the I ‑ 75 designation supplanted US 27 on the bridge , and U[MASK] 2 was shifted to follow I ‑ 75 along the fre[MASK]ways in the St. Ignace area . The former routing of US 2 in downtown St. Ignace was redesignated BL I ‑ 75 . More sections of freeway were opened in 1962 [MASK]mmediately to the south of the newly constructed International Bridge in Sault Ste . Marie as well as between Dafter and Kinross . The last two sections opened in 1963 connected the northern end of the freeway at M ‑ 123 to Kinross , and t[MASK]e section between Dafter and Sault Ste . Marie . At this time , all o[MASK] US 2 's former routing became a county road known as Mackinac Trail ( [MASK] @[MASK]@ 63 ) . 
 The Department of State Highways expanded US 2 / US 41 into[MASK]an expressway be[MASK]ween Gladstone[MASK]and Rapid River in 1971 . The state built a new bridge over the Manistique Rive[MASK] in 1983 , bypassing downtown .[MASK]MDOT disposed of the former routing of US 2 into downtown in two ways . The western[MASK]half was initially an unnumbered sta[MASK]e hi[MASK]hway until it was later transferred to local control . An extension of M ‑ 94[MASK]replaced[MASK]the remainder[MASK], including the Siphon B[MASK]idge , through[MASK]downtown . In that same yea[MASK][MASK], the department truncated US 2 to end in St. Ignace by removing it from the I ‑ 75 freeway . The last changes were made to US 2 's routing through Iron River in 1998 , bypassin[MASK] the bridge that formerly carried the hi[MASK]hway over the river in town . I[MASK] 2011 , MDOT raised the speed limi[MASK] along the expressway section i[MASK] Delta County f[MASK]om 5[MASK] to 65 mph ( 89 to 105 km /[MASK]h ) , although[MASK]the speed lim[MASK]t for trucks rem[MASK]ins 55 mph ( 89 km / h ) .

 On July 1 , 1924 , the State Administrative Board named M ‑ 12 , the predecessor to US 2 in Michigan , the Bohn Highw[MASK]y to honor Frank P. Bohn , a prominent local citizen who later served in Congress fro[MASK] 1927 to 1933 . In 1929 , the residents of Escanaba created a memorial to the veterans of World War[MASK]I called Memory Lane . The project consisted of elm and maple trees planted along US 2 / US 41 west of tow[MASK] . The American Legion sold the trees to local businesses and individuals who could honor specific soldiers . Later in 1949 , the Bessemer Women 's Club created a tribute in [MASK]he form of a permanent livi[MASK]g memorial to the area veterans . Also called Memory[MASK]Lane , the group planted 140 elms and 1 @,@ 840 evergreens , trees and shrubs as a landscaped parkway along 2 @.@ 3 miles ( 3 @.@ 7 km ) of US 2 e[MASK]st of Bessemer . 
 Most of US 2 , along w[MASK]th US 23 in the Lower Peni[MASK]sula , was designated the United Spanish War Veterans Memorial Highway in 1949 . To connect the [MASK]ap in the routing where US 2 cuts through Wisconsin , M ‑ 95 and M ‑ 69 were used in place of US 2 between[MASK]Iron Mountain and Crystal Falls . Signs marki[MASK]g the highway were not er[MASK]cted until 1968 when Governor George W. Romney had them in[MASK]talle[MASK] . 
 The Am[MASK]ets M[MASK]morial Drive designation was created for the section of US [MASK] / US 41 / M ‑ 35 between the northern Esca[MASK]aba city limits and County Road 426 ( CR 426 ) in Delta County . The Ame[MASK]ican Veterans ( AMVETS ) organization in Mich[MASK]gan petitioned the Michigan Legislature to grant this designation , which was assigned under Public Act 144 in 1959 [MASK][MASK]
 Two sections of US 2 are part of the overall Great[MASK]Lakes Circle Tour ( GLCT ) : th[MASK] segment from the Wisconsin state line near Ironwood to the M ‑ 28 junction in Wakefield[MASK]is par[MASK] of the Lake Superior Circle Tour ( LSCT ) , and the segment from the southern M ‑ 35 junction in Escanaba to[MASK]the eastern terminus in St. Ignace is part of the Lake Michigan Circle Tour[MASK]( LMCT ) . These two tours were created[MASK]in May 1986 through a joint effort between MDOT and it[MASK] counterparts in Wisconsin , Minnesota and Ontario . The section of US 2 between Iron River and Crystal F[MASK]lls has been named the [MASK]ron County Heritage Trail . This Pure Michigan Byway [MASK]as designated to honor the " rich history of two industries that built a state and nation : mining and [MASK]ogging . " On August[MASK]26 , 2007 , MDOT announced that the section of US 2 that r[MASK]ns concurrently with M ‑ 35 in Delta County was being included in the UP Hid[MASK]en [MASK]oast Recreational Heritage Trail . 
 
 = = Historic bridges =[MASK]= [MASK] 
 There[MASK]are six bridges along current or former section[MASK] of US 2 that MDOT has added [MASK]o its listing of Michigan 's Historic Bridges ; two of t[MASK]ese are also listed on the National Register of Historic Places ( NRHP ) . A third bridge added to the NRHP in late 2012 has not been[MASK]added to MDOT 's listin[MASK] however . Th[MASK] first of t[MASK]ese historic bridges is the crossi[MASK]g of [MASK]he Iron R[MASK]ver , which has since been[MASK]bypassed by a new bridge . The original struc[MASK]ure , dating to 1918 , is a 55 @-@ foot @-@ long ( 17 m ) spandrel arch span that was built by the MSHD as Trunk Li[MASK]e Bridge No. 191 . The structure was listed on[MASK]the NRHP on December 9 [MASK] 1999 , for its architectural and engineering [MASK]ignificance . 
 In [MASK]e[MASK]ember 2012 , the Nat[MASK]onal Park Service approved the listing of the[MASK]Upper Twin Falls Bridge that crosses the Menominee River north[MASK]est of Iron Mountain . The [MASK]tructure is a single [MASK]-@[MASK]span , pin @-@ connected , camelback [MASK] through @-@ truss bridge , and[MASK]it is the only known example of its type in Michigan . It was built bet[MASK]een 1909 and 1910 because the Twin Falls Power Dam would flood an existing river crossing . The span cost $ 5 @,@ 10[MASK] ( equivalent to $ 780 @,@ 000 in 2015 ) , paid equally by Dickinson and[MASK]Florence counties . Until the 1930s , the Upper Twin Fal[MASK]s Bridge carried U[MASK] 2 across the[MASK]Menominee River . In 1934 , a new bridge was built about a mile downstream , and the highway was rerouted over the new [MASK]pan .[MASK]The bridge closed to automobile traffic in[MASK]September 1971[MASK],[MASK]and the[MASK]nomination process for inclusion o[MASK] the National Register of Historic Places[MASK]began in 2012 . 
 In 2003 , MDOT re[MASK]laced the Sturgeon River [MASK]ridge i[MASK] Waucedah Towns[MASK]ip , Dickinson County . As of October 2011 , even though the old bridge was demo[MASK]ished and replaced , MDOT retained it on the[MASK]r historic bridge list . I[MASK] was built in 1929 . 
 Before 1983 , US 2 used a[MASK]different routing[MASK]through Manistique and crossed the Manistique River on what is [MASK]icknamed the " Siphon Bridge " . Built as a part of a raceway flume on the river , th[MASK] water [MASK]evel is[MASK]actually higher than the r[MASK]ad surface . This produces [MASK] siphon effect , giving the bridge its nickname . The Manistique Pulp an[MASK] Paper Company was organized in 1916 and needed a dam on the Manistique River to su[MASK]ply their mill [MASK] This dam w[MASK]uld requir[MASK] a large section of the city to be flooded , and shallow river banks meant difficulties in any bridge constr[MASK]ction . Ins[MASK]ead of expensive dikes , a concrete ta[MASK]k was built lengthwise in the riv[MASK]r bed ; the sides of this tank pro[MASK]ided man @-@ mad[MASK] banks highe[MASK] than the natural banks .[MASK]The Michi[MASK]an[MASK]Works Progress Administration described th[MASK] bridge as having " concrete bulkheads , formed by the side spans of the bridge , [ that ] allow the mill to maintain the water level several feet above the roadbed . " The Man[MASK]stique Tourism Cou[MASK]cil stated : " At one time , the bridge itself was partially supported b[MASK] [MASK]he water tha[MASK] was atmospherically forced under it , " and that the bridge ha[MASK] been featured in Ripley 's Believe It or Not ! . The eight @-@ span structure is 294 feet ( 90 m )[MASK]long . 
 The Cut [MASK]iver Bridge carries[MASK]US 2 across the Cut River in Hendricks Township , Mackinac County . This structure was built during World War II but completion was delayed due to war @-@ induced steel shortages . The span uses 888 short tons ( 793 long tons ; 806 t ) of structural steel to bridge the 641 feet ( 195 m ) over the river and its gorge at a height of 147 feet ( 45 m )[MASK]above the river . The Cut River Bridge is [MASK]n[MASK] of only two cantilevered deck truss bridges in the st[MASK]te . On either side of the bridge , there are p[MASK]cni[MASK] areas and trails down to the river . 
 Listed on the NRHP on December 17 , 1999 , the Mackinac Trail –[MASK]Carp River Bridge carries H @-@ 63 , the modern successor to US 2 , over the Carp River no[MASK]th of St. Ignace . The bridge is another spandrel arch struc[MASK]ure 60 feet ( 18 m ) in leng[MASK]h and built in 1920[MASK]. Inc[MASK]easi[MASK]g traffic along Mackinac Trail prompted the MSHD to " widen its deck by five feet [ 1 @.@ 5 m ] and install new guardrails in the 1929 – 1930 biennium " along with the addition of deco[MASK]ative retaining walls . 
 The last of the histori[MASK] bridges along a former segment of US 2 is the structure carrying Ashmun Street ([MASK]BS I ‑ 75 ) over the Power Canal in Sault Ste [MASK] Marie . B[MASK]ilt in 1934 [MASK] it is one of only three steel arch bridges in the state . The 42 @-@ foot @-@ wide ( 13 m ) and 257 @-@ foot @-@ lo[MASK]g ( 78 m ) s[MASK]ructure is described by MDOT as " massive " with an " innovative " construction method : the previous st[MASK]ucture was used[MASK]as a [MASK]alsework for the current bridge before removal .

During 1997 , after the co[MASK]mercially and c[MASK]itically successful release of Butterfly , Carey had not planned [MASK]o [MASK]our once again , due to th[MASK] long travel times and strain on her voice . However , due to overwhe[MASK]ming demand by fans , Carey agreed to p[MASK]rform in Asia once again , only extending the tour to Taiwan an[MASK] Australia , as well as one last show in the United S[MASK]ates . Rehearsals for the show began shortly after Christmas 1997 , extending for a period of[MASK]two weeks .

 The show began wi[MASK]h Carey standing on a small elevated [MASK]ent[MASK]rpiece on stage , surrounded by several long draped curtains . Carey featured three background vocalists throughout [MASK]he tour , Trey Lorenz , Melodie Daniels and Kelly P[MASK]ice . As the introduction began with " E[MASK]otions " , each of the curtains were slowly draped , revealing Carey atop [MASK]he platform , dressed in a bei[MASK]e mini @-@ dress and matching sheer blouse and stiletto heels .[MASK]As she be[MASK]an performing " Emotions " , the platform was lowered so Carey could [MASK]ccess the other sections of the sta[MASK]e throughout the song 's performance[MASK]. After [MASK]n intimate performance with dimmed lights for " The [MASK]oof ( Back [MASK]n Time ) " , Carey was [MASK]oined on @-@ stage by a Peruvian guitar player , who played the Latin @-@ inspired guitar melodies during her performance[MASK]of " My[MASK]All " . Afterwards , Carey sang " Close My[MASK]Eyes " , t[MASK]e only sitting performance of the show . During the song , several male backup dancer[MASK] performed slow and ample dance routines behind Carey on a higher level of the [MASK]tage . 
 For the second part of the [MASK]how , Carey had the sec[MASK]nd costume change of the even[MASK]ng , donning a long sequined bla[MASK]k go[MASK]n and semi @-@ teas[MASK]d hair . For the performance of " Dreamlover " , [MASK]arey w[MASK]s joined by three female back @-@ up dancers , who mimicked her light dance routines during the song . The next song on the set @-@ list was " Hero " , which featured Carey alone on @-@ stage , without any vocal back @-@ up . After the song 's performance , Carey[MASK]was joined on @-@ stage by Lorenz , who performed " I 'll[MASK]Be There " alongside her . Next came " Make It Happen " , a song which accompanied yet anot[MASK]er wa[MASK]drobe change for Carey . She donned a shor[MASK] mini @-@ skir[MASK] , alongside a sleeveless white blouse [MASK]nd loose golden curls .[MASK]O[MASK] @-@ stage , Carey was joined by a full church choir , all dresse[MASK] in lon[MASK] black garments . After the song 's recital , Carey performed " One Sweet Day " , alongside a previously recorded video of Boyz II Men during their live perf[MASK]rman[MASK]e of the song w[MASK]th Carey at Madison Square Garden in 1995 . 
 After completing the song , Carey changed to a pair of leg @-@ hugging blue jeans and a tank top . Her next performance was t[MASK]e " Fantasy[MASK]" remix , fea[MASK]uring Ol ' Dirty Bastard on a la[MASK][MASK]e pr[MASK]jection screen behind the sta[MASK]e , as Carey performed light chair dance @-[MASK] routines alongside several male dancer[MASK] . The performance featured the most i[MASK]tricate choreography Carey performed on the tour . After a low @-@ key performance of " Babydoll " ,[MASK]or " Whenever You Call " in other countries , Carey was once again[MASK]joined by several male dancers , as she sang " H[MASK]ney " , [MASK]hile re @-@ enacting the music video during a small skit [MASK] Carey once again changed to a [MASK]eige e[MASK]semble similar to her first outfit before performing her debut single , " Vision of Love " . The fina[MASK] song on the tour was " Butt[MASK]rfly " , which featured large stills of butterflies and flowers p[MASK]ojected onto the large screen behind Carey . She donned a long brown sequine[MASK] gown for the performance , being joined on stage once again by h[MASK]r trio of back @-@ up sing[MASK]rs . Durin[MASK] the shows in Japan , Carey performed her h[MASK]liday classic " All I Want for Christmas [MASK]s You " , al[MASK]ngside var[MASK]ous male and female dancers on stage who performed light dance routines alongside Carey . During the song , [MASK]arey donned a Santa suit and matching h[MASK]t ,[MASK]while being carried on a large stage prop by the dancers .

 Virtually [MASK]he entire tour was an instant sell @-@ out ; the four shows at Ja[MASK]an 's largest stadium , Tokyo Dome , broke Care[MASK] '[MASK] p[MASK]evious ticket @-@ sales record , sell[MASK]ng out all 200 @,@ 000 tickets in under one hour . Additionally , the entire Australian leg sold out within hours , leading Carey to extend the tour one more da[MASK]e in the United States . The show at Hawaii 's 50 @,@[MASK]000 c[MASK][MASK]acit[MASK] Aloha Stadium sold ou[MASK] as well , making her one of [MASK]he[MASK]few acts in the stadium[MASK] history to [MASK]ell out the entire venue . Aside from its commercial success , [MASK]ans and critics raved about the show 's visuals , as well as Carey 's vocal delivery .

[MASK]= Thelnetham Windmill = 
 
 Thelnetham Windmill , also known as Button 's Mill is a Grad[MASK] II * list[MASK]d tower mill [MASK]onstructed of brick . The windmill is [MASK]ocated[MASK]at Thelnetham , Suffolk , England . It[MASK]was built in the early nineteenth century to grind wheat into f[MASK]our . Thelnetham w[MASK]ndmill worked by wind po[MASK]er until 1924 , latterly on two sails , after which it became derelict . 
 In 1979 , a [MASK]rou[MASK] of enthusiasts purchase[MASK] Thelnetham windmill fo[MASK] restoration . Numerous volunteers help[MASK]d to [MASK]e[MASK]tore the mill to ful[MASK] working order over an eight @-@ year period . The mill is open to the public , and flour ground at the mill can be bought at the site . 
 The mill[MASK]is[MASK]a small four storey tower mill with Patent sails and winded by a fantail . It drives two pairs of millstones , with a third pair driven by an auxiliary engine . 
 
 = = History = = 
 
 The windmill at Thelnetham was built by millwright George Bloo[MASK]field for William Button in 1819 . It replaced a post mill which had been move[MASK] to Sandy Lane , Diss , Norfolk the previous year . The mill was [MASK]et to work on Christmas Day 1819 . I[MASK] 1832 , the mill was modernised by the fitting of [MASK] cast @-@ iron windshaft , Patent sails and a fantail . The new windshaft was fitted on 16 July 1832 .[MASK]It was made by J Aickman , the Kings Lynn millwright , and weighs 1 ¾ tons ( 1 @,@ 780 kg ) . A new stock was fitted in September 1836 .[MASK]William Button died on 11 February 1837[MASK]. The mil[MASK] passed[MASK]jointly to his widow Rebec[MASK]a and [MASK]heir son Richard . Richard Button worked the mill until 1860 , at which date it was conveyed to his sons Richard and William , who sold it to Richard Pever[MASK]tt from Kenninghall , Norfolk in 1862 . 
 Th[MASK] mill was worked by Stephen Peverett[MASK], Richard 's son . He inherited the mill on the deat[MASK] of his father in 1875 and leased it to Henry Bryant in 187[MASK] . In 1884 , the mill was sold by auction , and Henry Bryant purchased the freehold . Bryant rebuilt the floors of the mill . From 1892 , a portable steam engine was used as auxilia[MASK]y power , driving an extra pair of mills[MASK]ones on the ground floor . This was replaced in 1914 by a Hornsby o[MASK]l engine . Bryant ran th[MASK] mill until 1920 when he[MASK]sold it to Alphonso Vincent , a retired millwright from Garboldisham , Norfolk . The Hornsb[MASK] engine w[MASK]s sold in the early 1920s . The mill was tailwinded c1920 , and as a result one pair of sails was removed . Vincent carried out som[MASK] repairs to the mill and ran it until he retired in 1924 . One of the remaining two sails was wrecked in 1926 when the mill was again tailwinded . 
 On the death of Alphonso Vincent in 1932 , his son George inherited the prope[MASK]ty . He lived at the site in an old lorry until his de[MASK]th in 1973 . The mill passed to his daughter , who sold it[MASK]in 1974 to Mr and Mrs Humphries , who [MASK]ntended to convert it into a house . They later[MASK]changed their minds and offered it for sale for restor[MASK]tion . In 197[MASK] ,[MASK]the cap of the mill was blown to pieces[MASK]in a g[MASK]le . Thelnetham windmill was purchased by five members of the Suffolk Mills Group in November 1979 , and plans for rest[MASK]ra[MASK]ion were mad[MASK] . The consortium consisted of Mark [MASK]arnard , Charles Dolman , Peter Dolman , David Pearce and Ch[MASK]is Seago . The d[MASK]relic[MASK] mill and an acre of land cost £ 6 @,@ 000 . 
 
 = = Restoration = = 
 
 The mill was restored over a period of six years . Much [MASK]f the work was carried[MASK]out by enthusiasts who used wor[MASK]ing hol[MASK]days to repair the mill . 
 
 = = = 1979 – 1980 = = = 
 
 The consortium[MASK]took possession of the mill in November 1979 . The first priority was to mak[MASK] the mill as weathertight as possible . Polythene sheets were spread on the dust floo[MASK] of the mill to prevent [MASK]urther water penetration of the structure . The mi[MASK]l was surveyed and recorded . In spring 1980 , the dust flo[MASK]r partially collapsed and was removed as a safety measure . Scaffolding was erected t[MASK] allow the fanstage to be dismantled , and the cap[MASK]centering wheel[MASK] were removed in prepara[MASK]ion for the rem[MASK]val of the cap frame . 
 A t[MASK]o @-@ week work @-@ in was held at the end of July and beginning o[MASK] August 1980 . Thirty @-@ three volunteers worked on the mill over the work @-@ in . Two new main floor beams for th[MASK] dust floor were made from baulks of pitc[MASK] pine which had previously been in a maltings at Bury St Edmunds . On 3 August 1980 , the windshaft and remaining sail fra[MASK]ments were remo[MASK]ed by a mobile crane , f[MASK]llowed by th[MASK] c[MASK]p [MASK]rame and th[MASK] cast @-[MASK] iron [MASK]urb sections . 
 New oak joists were laid on the dust floor and temporary boarding l[MASK]id to provide a working platform for repairs to the top of the mill towe[MASK] . The bin f[MASK]oor was removed , apart from[MASK]one oak main beam which was repairable . A r[MASK]placement main beam[MASK]was made fr[MASK]m pitch pine , and the oa[MASK] beam was repaired . New oak joists were fitted , along with some salvaged from the [MASK]riginal floor which were fit to be reused . One of these had previously been [MASK] whip from a Common sail . Some of the jo[MASK]sts were made fro[MASK] pitch pin[MASK] [MASK]rom the Eastbridge Windpump , which , follow[MASK]ng its collap[MASK]e on 19 February 1977 , ha[MASK] been re @-@ erected at the Museum of East Anglian Life , Stowmarket . The sack hoist was dismantled to enable its repair , brickwork wa[MASK] repaired , a[MASK]d [MASK]ew [MASK]intels were made for some [MASK]f the windows . A tarpaulin was secured over the mill tower to keep the weath[MASK]r out over winter . The floorboards on the bin floor were replaced and one of the two pairs of millstones was removed . 
 The work was financed by grants of £ 500 [MASK]rom the Council for the Preservation of Rural Essex , £ 250 from St Edmundsbury [MASK]orough Council , £ 200 from the Scarfe Trust , and £ 200 from the Suffolk Mills Group . Other donations and income amounted to £ 65 , with the balance o[MASK] expenditure being me[MASK] jointly by the five owners . 
 The " work @-@ in " was reported in both local and national media , including BBC Look East , Bury Free P[MASK]ess[MASK], Eastern Daily Press , Ea[MASK]t Anglian Daily Times , Daily Telegr[MASK]ph , and Radio Orwell . 
 
 = = = 1981 = = = 
 
 In the 1981 season two separate work @-@ ins were hel[MASK] , the first from 25 July to 2 August and the second from 22 August to 30[MASK]August . A total of 37 volunteers participated over the two weeks . 
 The millstones were removed from the stone floor , which wa[MASK] then repair[MASK]d . One of the main beams was found to have been attacked by Death Watch beetles , and over a third o[MASK] the elm beam [MASK]as rep[MASK]aced with oak . The six supports for the h[MASK]rst frame were repaired[MASK]one at a time , as they bore the whole of the weig[MASK]t of the machinery above . One post required replacement . It had rott[MASK]d and the floor had sunk[MASK]by 4 inches ( 100 mm ) causing the sec[MASK]nd main floor beam to fracture . When th[MASK]s work had been completed , the stone floor was removed , including the second main floor bea[MASK] , which was removed in one piece so that the most suitable route to install its r[MASK]placement could be assessed . 
 The new main beam[MASK]for the sto[MASK]e floor was installed and the ground floor was concreted . The stone[MASK]floor was re[MASK]onstructed , reusing the old stone bearers an[MASK] those joists that were fit for reuse . Other joists were made new from oak or pitch pine . New floorboards w[MASK]re laid in the dust floor , the 1 1 ⁄ 4 inches ( 32 mm ) thick elm boards being double @-@ [MASK]rooved with a metal[MASK]tongue between them . Those on the bin floor are of a similar configuration . Th[MASK] top four courses of brickwork of the mill tow[MASK]r were removed and work began on rebuilding them [MASK] aided by a trammel attac[MASK]ed to the upright sha[MASK]t[MASK]. 
 D[MASK]ring the second work @-@ in , the remainder of the ston[MASK] floor was boarded , agai[MASK] using double @-@ grooved board[MASK] with a metal tongue between them . The window on the dust floor was rebuilt and the reconstruction of the top four courses of brickwork continued . The top two courses were rebuilt with red engineering bricks . The dust floor window had a reinforced concrete lintel cast as the tower was weak at[MASK]thi[MASK] point and had distorted .[MASK]The windshaf[MASK] , the curb s[MASK]gments and fantail gear[MASK]ng were given two coats of red lead paint . A new finial for [MASK]he cap was mad[MASK] from a piece of oak 3 feet ([MASK]910 mm ) long by 16 inches ( 410 mm ) diam[MASK]ter . A start [MASK]as made on remo[MASK]ing the old pointing on the[MASK]brickwork and repointing with gau[MASK]ed mortar . 
 After [MASK]he work @-@ in had finished , the boardi[MASK]g of [MASK]he stone floor wa[MASK] completed and the mill thoroughly cleaned in preparation for an open[MASK][MASK]ay which was held in late autumn . The work done in 1981 cost £ 3 @,@ 250 . Donations r[MASK]ceive[MASK] were £ 2 @,@ 000 f[MASK]om Rank Xerox , £ 1 @,@ 704 from the Historic Building[MASK] Council and £ 130 from St Edmundsbury Borough Co[MASK]ncil . Other donations and income[MASK]received amounted to £ 70 . The proje[MASK]t received further coverage in local media , the Eastern Daily Press , and South Norfolk News .

 The 1982 work @-@ ins took place from 24 July t[MASK] 1 [MASK]ugust and 21 August to 29 August . The work pla[MASK]ned included the complet[MASK]on of the brickwor[MASK] at the top of the tower , inst[MASK]llation of the Elm curb , a start on the constr[MASK]ction of the new cap , installing machiner[MASK] and making and fitting[MASK]various[MASK]doors and windows . The cap fram[MASK] was constructed , incorporating two beams from the original cap frame that were[MASK]fit to be re[MASK]sed . The cap frame was completed in autumn 1982 . It had been constructed upside down and a[MASK]mobile crane was used to turn it over and place the[MASK]windshaft in[MASK]o p[MASK]sitio[MASK] . 
 
[MASK]= = = 1983 = = = 
 
 Work in the early part of 1[MASK]83[MASK]was[MASK]mainly confined t[MASK] smaller jobs such as casting various brasses and overhaul of the var[MASK]ous parts of the fantail driv[MASK]train and mechanism for control[MASK]ing the Patent sails . The mill was generally made as safe as possible inside in preparation for schedule[MASK] visits , including one from the Wind and Watermill Section of the Society for the Protection of Ancient Buildings .[MASK][MASK]ther work included [MASK]he o[MASK]erhaul of the final drive to the 4 feet 7 [MASK]nches ( 1 @.[MASK] 40 m[MASK]) stones , including dismantling the stone nut and replacement of th[MASK]ee cogs in be[MASK]ch . [MASK] When the weather improved , work commenced outside . The cap circle was mostly constructed before the firs[MASK] work @-@ in commenced . The wor[MASK] @-@ ins took place over two separate weeks in July and August , with [MASK]5 people participating . D[MASK]ring the first work @-@ in , the fantail posts and braces were fitted . The oak cap ribs , which had been prefabricated[MASK]offsite were fitted and the finial was supp[MASK]rted by scaffolding ready for final fitting . Inte[MASK][MASK]diate noggings of[MASK]oak were fitted and the[MASK]finial was p[MASK]lled into position using a[MASK]windlass . The [MASK]ap frame was competed with the fitting of intermediate ribs and noggings . The[MASK]rear of the cap circle was also completed during this time . 
 Between [MASK]he two work @-@[MASK]ins , the rear dormer was completed and the fitting of noggings to the [MASK]ap frame completed . This enabled a start to be made on boarding the cap on the Monday of the[MASK]se[MASK]ond work @-@ in . The boards f[MASK]r the cap are ½ inch ( 13 mm ) thick and 9 inches ( 230 mm ) wide at the petticoat , tapering toward[MASK][MASK]the top . A new neck bearing was i[MASK]stalled under the windshaft , not without difficulty and much machining before it would fit . When the boarding of the cap was completed , the cover strips were fi[MASK]ted over the joints . The petticoat was drawn into position using a rope and windlass , and the galvanised steel reinforcing band screwed into position , produ[MASK]ing a sturdy structure . The striking rod was fitted through the windshaft and the axle for the fantail fitted in position on top [MASK]f the fantail posts . At the top of the mill t[MASK]wer , the curb was prepared [MASK]o accept the cap , and the[MASK]cast iron curb track plates bolted into position [MASK][MASK]Re[MASK]ointing of the brickwork of the tower continued , wit[MASK] nearly half of it completed at the end of the [MASK]econd wor[MASK] @-@ in[MASK]. 
[MASK][MASK]fter the wo[MASK]k @-@ ins had ended , work continued on[MASK]finishing the [MASK]ap which was scheduled for lift @-@ on in October . The weather hampered the work initially , but the application of a modern microporous paint , designed to withstand normal movement of the timber and yet remain waterproof , was completed in time for the lift @-@ on .[MASK]A m[MASK]ni work @-@ in was held the weekend before [MASK]he cap was lifted , with 17 people p[MASK]rticipating over the [MASK]eekend . Final work was done to the cap and a new window was fitted to the stone floor of the mill . The tarpaulin was removed and t[MASK]e trammel[MASK]dismantled . The 5[MASK]@-@ ton cap was lifted into place by a mobil[MASK] [MASK]rane [MASK]n 24 October 1983 , watched by a crowd of some 70 people . The fitting of the cap was [MASK]oasted with b[MASK]er from Ad[MASK]ams Brewery , Southwold . 
 Restoration work in 1983 cost £ 1 @,@ 408 [MASK] Grants were received from the Association of Independent Museums , Blo ' Norton Women 's Instit[MASK]te , Ipswich Historical Transport Society , the National Association for Gifted Children , Mr D. Porter and the Society for the Protec[MASK]ion of[MASK]Ancient Buildings .[MASK]Further income came from the sale of guide books and a drawing of the mill by Wilf Foreman . 
 
 = = = 1984 [MASK] = = 
 
 Four [MASK]ork @-@ ins were held during 1984 . The first two were by apprentices[MASK]from Eastern Electricity Board . Thelnetham Windmi[MASK]l was chosen at the project to benefit from the Young Person 's Development Project for that year . Pakenham Watermi[MASK]l [MASK]ad previously benefited from the project , and its owners , the Suffol[MASK] Preservation Trust , had suggeste[MASK] that Thelnetham Windmil[MASK] wo[MASK]ld be a good candidate for the scheme . Two separate parties spen[MASK] a week each at the mill . A mains electricity supply was provided .[MASK]An underground[MASK]cable was laid with assistance from Bri[MASK]ish Telecom who were trialling a thrust bore[MASK] which had been developed at their research facility at Martlesham Heath . The thrust borer laid 25 [MASK]ards ( 23 m ) of ducting through which the mains cable was pulled into position . The mill was then supplied with lights and sockets on each floor . 
 Other work undertaken b[MASK] the appr[MASK]ntices involved repairing some fros[MASK] damage to th[MASK] foundation brickwork , digging a drainage trench[MASK]around the mill and moving the aux[MASK]liary engine into position . A concrete path ar[MASK]und the tower was trapping moisture , leading to[MASK]rising damp . A Fren[MASK]h drain was constructed around th[MASK] mill to remedy these problem . A 21 horsepower ( 16 kW ) Ruston & Hornsby 4YHR diesel engin[MASK] had been[MASK]purchased in 1981 and was fitted onto a permanent concrete base with the aid of a mobile crane . After fit[MASK]ing it [MASK]as then painted . Some missing or broken parts[MASK]were made or repaired as necessary . 
 Off @-@ site , the new brake wheel and fantail were made . The original brake wheel was too rotte[MASK] to repair , and showed evidence that it had been [MASK]lter[MASK]d from t[MASK]e original o[MASK]e installed in 1819 . The original brake wheel w[MASK]s 6 feet ( 1 @.@ 83 m ) diameter to al[MASK]ow the Common [MASK][MASK]ils to run at their optimum speed [MASK] When the mill was modernised in[MASK]1832 it was necessary to alter the gear ratios within the mill , as Patent sails [MASK]un at a slower speed tha[MASK] Common sails . The great spur wheel was increased in diameter and[MASK]the stone nuts reduced in diameter . The bra[MASK]e wheel was also rebuilt , with a[MASK]cast iron segment ring fitted in place of the original cogs , resulting in a wheel 7 feet 2 inches ( 2 @.@[MASK]18 m ) in diameter . The opinion of professional millwrights was sought , and it was decided that a scaled @-@ up version of [MASK]he original brake wheel would be made , b[MASK]t retaining the cast iron teeth segments . The remains of the original brake wheel were retained as an exhibit in the mill . The original iron segments were all broken , so a pattern was made and[MASK]new [MASK]egments were cast i[MASK] heat @-@ treated malleable cast iron . When the [MASK]rak[MASK] wheel w[MASK]s completed i[MASK] was dismantled and transported to t[MASK]e mill ready for reassembly . 
 The fantai[MASK] was made . Some[MASK]of the smal[MASK] gears were replac[MASK]d . The stocks were made from [MASK]itch pine and the blades from Douglas fir . Work at the mill over the winter included repairs to the brickwork and w[MASK]ndows , with only one window s[MASK]ill needing attention when the first work @-@ in began . New beech cogs were fitted to the cro[MASK][MASK] wheel , wh[MASK]ch[MASK]was restored to its correct positio[MASK] on the upri[MASK]ht shaft . 
 The stocks and sails were made during the two work @-@ ins held in July and August , a total of 41 peo[MASK]le attending[MASK]over the two weeks . A second @-@ hand stock had been bought in the 1920s and preserved at the mill , but upon examinat[MASK]on i[MASK] was fo[MASK]nd to be unfit for use . Thus two new stocks were required instead of one . Modern steel stocks had already been discounted on cost and durability grounds , leaving two options . Tra[MASK]itional stocks made from a si[MASK]gle piece of timber , or laminated stocks . Good quality pitch pine was not obtainable in the[MASK]lengt[MASK]s required . Douglas fir was obtainable in such lengths but[MASK]w[MASK]s discounted o[MASK] st[MASK]ength and durability grounds . A Douglas fir stock on a nearby mill had rotted[MASK]after only seven years . Thus it was decided that laminated stocks would be made . 
 The 52 [MASK]eet ( 15 @.@ 85 m ) lo[MASK][MASK] stocks were made from Douglas fir . All timber had[MASK]been pressure treate[MASK] with prese[MASK]vative and well seasoned . It was es[MASK]imated that a laminated stock [MASK]ould be up to 20 % stronger than a similar stock of solid timber .[MASK]The timber used was 1 1 ⁄ 2 inches ( 38 mm ) thick and nine laminations were required at the centre , where the stock passes through [MASK]he poll end of t[MASK]e win[MASK]shaft . Careful at[MASK]ention[MASK]was paid to where individual joints occurred between different pieces of timber . Both stocks were made during the work @-@ in , with one of them being trimmed and finished ready for use . The stocks were the firs[MASK] laminated stocks made by amateurs . 
 The f[MASK]ur sails were made . The originals being s[MASK]ightly different pairs . Those on the inner stock having bays o[MASK] 3 feet ( 910 mm ) pitch and those on the outer stock having bays of 3 [MASK]eet[MASK]2 inches ( 970 mm ) pitch . It was decided that the new sails wo[MASK]ld be identical , at the larg[MASK]r pitch . Fou[MASK] 27 feet ( 8 @.@ 23 m ) long whips were cut from a baulk of pitch pine obtained from a demolished maltings at Bury St Edmunds . The wh[MASK]ps are 6 inches ( 150 mm ) square at their inner end . Sail bars and uplongs were made from modern pitch pine , selected for quality . The mo[MASK]tices for the sail bars were cut . That at the heel of the sail being at[MASK]27 ° [MASK]nd that at the tip being 15 ° , decreasing by 1 ½ ° at each sai[MASK] bar . Three of the four sails [MASK]ad been completed at the end of the work[MASK][MASK]n .[MASK]
 The fantail and associated gearing was fitted to the mill . At the end of the secon[MASK] work @-@ in , the cap could be turned by means of t[MASK]e hand c[MASK]ank . The fantail itself , with the blades painted red , white and blue was installed [MASK]hortly afterwards . The clasp arm brake wheel was assembled aroun[MASK] the windshaft . It was found that the w[MASK]llower was eccentric on the upright shaft by ½ inch ( 13 mm ) .[MASK]When this was corrected the brake wheel[MASK]was within 1 / 16 th of an inch ( less than 1 mm ) of true . The clamps for the stocks were sawn from [MASK] baulk of pit[MASK]h pine ready for completion later in the year . Other work included[MASK]a new frame for one of the ground floor doors , cleaning and painting ironwork an[MASK] further repointing on the brickwork . The four sails were fitted to the mill with the aid of a mobile crane at the end of the sec[MASK]nd work @-@ in . The stock , with one sail attached was carefully inserted thr[MASK]ugh t[MASK]e poll end of the windshaft and when wedged in position and the clamps had[MASK]been attached the second sail was fitted to the stock . The process was [MASK]epeated for[MASK]the secon[MASK] pair of sails . The mill turned by wind again on the las[MASK] day of the second work @-@ in . 
 Work later in the year included the finishing of [MASK]he fourth sail , balan[MASK]ing the [MASK]antail and sorti[MASK]g out teething troubles with the fantail gearing . The brake[MASK]and brake lever were made and installed and shutte[MASK] cranks for the sails were cast .

 As built in 1819 
 A four[MASK]@-@ storey tower mill with Common sails carried on a wooden windsh[MASK]ft , driving two p[MASK]irs of overdrift mi[MASK]lstones . Brake wheel 6 feet ( 1 @.@ 83 m ) diameter . Winding wa[MASK] by hand . 
 As restored 
 [MASK]he four @-@ st[MASK]rey tower is built of brick , and stands 31 [MASK]eet 5 inches ( 9 @.@ 58 m ) from ground level to the curb . The walls are 2 feet ([MASK]610 mm ) thick at ground level . The mill is d[MASK]scribed from the top down .[MASK]
 The pepperpot cap sits on top of the tower , giving the m[MASK]ll an overall height of 45 feet ( 13 @.@ 72 m ) to the f[MASK]nial . It houses the cast @-@ iron windshaft and 7 feet 2 inches ( 2 @.@ 18 m ) diameter w[MASK]oden brake wheel internally . Ext[MASK]rnally the four double Paten[MASK] sails span 64 feet ( 19 @.@ 51 m ) . They are 9 feet ( 2 @.@ 74 m )[MASK]wide and can develop 30 horsepower ( 22 kW ) . The eight bladed fantail keeps the mill turned into wind . 
[MASK]The top floor of the [MASK]ill is the dust floor . It could be used for stor[MASK]ge of grain and gives internal access to the [MASK]ap . The cast @-@ iron wallower[MASK], which is driven by the brake wheel is carr[MASK]ed at the top of the upright shaft , in the centre[MASK]of the mill . 
 The bin floor is where the grain is stored before b[MASK]ing ground into flour . The sack hoist mechanism is housed on this floor , d[MASK]iven from the wooden crown wheel on the floor below by belt . 
 The stone floor is where the two pairs of underdrift French Burr[MASK]millstones are located . Th[MASK] stones are 4 feet 4 inches ( 1 @.@ 32 m ) and 4 feet 7 inches ( 1 @.@ 40 m ) diameter .

 " Sailor Mouth " was directed by Andrew Overtoom , and was written by Walt Dohrn , Paul Tibbitt , and Merriwether Williams . Dohrn an[MASK] [MASK]ibbitt also served as storyboard directors , and[MASK]Carson Kugler[MASK], William Reiss and Erik Wiese worked as storyboard[MASK]artists . Series creator Stephen Hillenburg has described the episode plot as " a classic thing all kids go through . " Much of the storyline for the episode was ins[MASK]ired by the writers ' own experiences f[MASK]om childhood . The episo[MASK]e originally aired on Nickelodeon in the United States on September 21 , 2[MASK]01 . The episode marks the intro[MASK]uction of Mr. Krabs ' mother , Mama Krabs , who was voiced by former SpongeBob SquarePants creative prod[MASK]cer and current exe[MASK]utive producer[MASK]Paul Tibbitt . 
 The writing staff used their individual childhood ex[MASK]eriences as inspirations to come up with much of the story lines for this episode . The idea for " Sailor Mouth " was inspired[MASK]by creative dire[MASK]tor Derek[MASK]Drymon 's experience " [ when ] I got in trouble for saying the f @-@ word in front of my mother . " Drymon said , " The scene where Patrick is running to [MASK]r. Krabs to tattle , with SpongeBob chasing him [MASK] is pretty much how it happened in real life . " The end of the e[MASK]isode , where Mr.[MASK]Krabs uses more p[MASK]ofanity than SpongeBob and Patrick , [MASK]as also inspired " by the fact th[MASK]t my [ Drymon [MASK]s ] mother has a sailor mouth hers[MASK]lf . " 
 The scene where [MASK]po[MASK]geBob and Patrick playing a game [MASK]f Eels and Escalators , which is a parody of Snakes and Ladders , was difficult for the crew to animate , since many shots featured certain board pieces changing location . According to the series ' sea[MASK]on 2 DVD commentary , it was planned to have a scene that[MASK]had SpongeBob saying " Go ' dolphin noise ' yourself " followed[MASK]by Patrick saying " ' Dolphin noise ' you too ! " during the Eels and Escalato[MASK]s game . It was removed in the final episode check because it would have been inappropriate for the younger [MASK]udience . 
 " Sailor Mouth " was released on the DVD compilation called SpongeBob S[MASK]uarePants : Sea Stories on March 12 , 2002 . It was [MASK]lso included in the SpongeBob Sq[MASK]arePants : The Complete 2nd Season DVD released on October 19 , 2004 .

She[MASK]said " ' Sailor Mouth ' just barely missed being in[MASK]the numbe[MASK] one slot . " Basile praised the episode 's plot and called it " genius [ ... ] because child[MASK]en can relate to the forbidden thrill of using curse words , and [MASK]dults can laugh at the parody of TV censorship . " In an in[MASK]erview with Paul Tibbitt , one of the episode 's writers , he told that " Sailor Mouth " is his second favorite SpongeBob episode .

 According to a report titled Wolves in Sheep 's Clothing [MASK] which d[MASK]cuments[MASK]the incre[MASK]se in potentially violent , profane , and sexual content in children 's programming , the Parents Television [MASK]ouncil , a wa[MASK]chdog media group , and fans believed the SpongeBob SquarePan[MASK]s episode " Sai[MASK]or Mouth " was an implicit attempt to promote and satir[MASK]ze use of profanity among[MASK]children . The e[MASK]isode originally aired during the 2001 – 02 television season , ironically the season in which the PTC nam[MASK]d SpongeBob SquarePants among the best programs on cable television , but the report cited a repeat broad[MASK]ast of the episode from 2005 to prove its point that it promoted use of p[MASK]ofanity [MASK]mong children . In a[MASK]later report , several members of the PTC listed " Sailor Mouth " as an example of how levels of profane , sexual , and violent activity has increased in children 's television program[MASK]ing . Nickelodeon , in response to the incident , said " It 's sad and a little desperate that they stooped to literally putting profane language in the [MASK]ouths[MASK]of our characters to make a point .

 = Military history of Australia = 
 
 The military history of Australia spans the nation 's 220 @-@ year modern history , from the e[MASK]rly Australian frontier wars between Aboriginals and Europeans to the ongoing conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan in the early 21st century . Alt[MASK]ough t[MASK]i[MASK] history is short wh[MASK]n compared to that of many other nations , Austra[MASK]ia has been involved in numerous conflicts and war[MASK] , [MASK]n[MASK] war and military service have been significant influences on Australian society and national identity , including the Anzac spirit . The relationship between war and Australian society has also been sha[MASK]ed by[MASK]the enduring themes of Australian st[MASK]ategic culture a[MASK]d its unique security dilemma . 
 As British offshoots , the Aust[MASK]ali[MASK]n [MASK]ol[MASK]nies participated in Britain 's small wars of the 19th century , while later as a federated dominion , and t[MASK]en an independent n[MASK]tion , Australia fought in the First World War and Second World War , as well as in the wars in Korea , Malaya[MASK], Borneo and Vietnam d[MASK]ring the Cold[MASK]War . In the Post @-@[MASK]Vietnam era Australia[MASK] forces have been involved in numerous international peacekeeping missions , through the United Nations [MASK]nd other agen[MASK]ies , including in the Sinai , Pe[MASK]sian Gulf , Rwanda , Somalia , East Timor and the Solomon Islands , while more recently they have also fought as part [MASK]f multi @-@ lateral forces in Iraq and Afghanistan . In total , nearly 103 @,@ 000 Australians died during the [MASK][MASK]urse of these c[MASK]nflicts . 
 
 = = War and Australian society = = [MASK] 
 For most of the l[MASK]st century military service[MASK]has be[MASK]n one of the single greatest shared experiences of white Australian males , and alth[MASK]ugh this is now changi[MASK]g due to the pro[MASK]essionalisation of the m[MASK]litary and the absence of major wars during the second half of the 20th century , it continues to influence[MASK]Australian society to this day . War and military servi[MASK]e h[MASK]ve been defining influences in Au[MASK]tralian history , wh[MASK]l[MASK] a major part of the national identity has been built on an idealised conception of the Australian experience of war and[MASK]of soldiering , known as the Anzac spirit . [MASK]hese ideals include no[MASK]ions of endurance , courage , ingenuity , humour , larrikinism , egalitarianism and mateship ; traits which , ac[MASK]ording to popular thought , de[MASK]ined the behaviour of Austr[MASK]lian soldiers fighting at Gallipoli during the First World War .[MASK]The Gal[MASK]ipoli campaign was one o[MASK] the first internation[MASK]l events that saw [MASK]ustralians taking part as Australians and has been seen as[MASK]a key event i[MASK] forging a sense of national identity . 
 The relationship between war a[MASK]d Australian society has been shaped by two of the more [MASK]nduring themes of Australian strategic culture : bandwagoning with a power[MASK]ul ally and expeditionary w[MASK]rfare .[MASK]Indeed , Australian defence policy was closely [MASK]inked to Britain until [MASK]he Japanese crisis of 1942 , while since then an alliance with the United States has underwri[MASK]ten its security . Arguably , this pattern of bandwagoning — both for cultural reasons such as shared values and beliefs , as well as for more pragmatic security concer[MASK]s — has ensured that Australian strategic policy has often been defined by relations with its allies . Regardless , a tendency towards strategic complacency has also been evident , with [MASK]ustralians often reluctant to think about defence [MASK]ssues or to allocate resources until a crisis arises ; a trait which ha[MASK] historically resul[MASK]ed in unpreparedness for major military challenges . 
 R[MASK]flecting[MASK]both the realist and liberal paradigms of international relations and the conception of national interests , a nu[MASK]ber of other important themes in Australian strat[MASK]gic cultu[MASK]e are also obvious . Such t[MASK]e[MASK]es include : an acceptance of the state as the key actor in internationa[MASK] politics , [MASK]he centrality of notions o[MASK] Westphalian sovereignty , a belief in the enduring relevance and legiti[MASK]acy of armed force as a guarantor of security , and the proposition that the status quo in internat[MASK]onal [MASK]ffairs should only be changed peac[MASK]fully . Likewise , multilateralism , collectiv[MASK] security and defence se[MASK]f @-@ reliance have also been important th[MASK]mes . Change has been more evolutionary than revolutionary and these strategic behaviours have persisted throughout its history , being the product of Australian society '[MASK] democratic political tradition and Judaeo @-[MASK] Christian [MASK]nglo @-@ European heritage , as well its associated values , beli[MASK]fs and economic , political and religious ideology . These behaviours are also refl[MASK]ctive of its unique security dilemma as a largely European island on the edge of the Asia @-@ Pacific , and the geopolitical c[MASK]rcumstances of a middle power physica[MASK][MASK]y removed from the centres of world power . To be sure , during threats to th[MASK] core Australia has often found itself defending the periphery and perhaps a[MASK] a result , it has frequently beco[MASK]e i[MASK]volved in fore[MASK]gn wars . Throughout these conflicts [MASK]ustralian soldiers — known colloquially as Diggers — have often b[MASK][MASK]n noted , somewhat paradoxically [MASK] for both their fighting abilities and their huma[MASK]itarian qualities .

[MASK]From 1788 until 1870 the defence of the[MASK]Australi[MASK]n colonies was [MASK]ostly[MASK]pro[MASK]ided by British Army regular force[MASK] . Originally Ma[MASK]ines protected the early settlements at Sydney Cove a[MASK]d Norfo[MASK]k Island , however they were relieved of these duties in 1790 by a British Army unit specifically recruited for colonial service , known as the [MASK]ew South Wales Corps . The New So[MASK]th Wales Corps subsequent[MASK]y was involved in putting down a rebellion of Irish convicts at Castle Hill in 1804 . Soon however shortcoming[MASK] in the c[MASK]rps convinced the War Office of the need for a more reliable garrison in New South Wales and Van Diemen 's Land . Chief of these shortcoming[MASK] wa[MASK] the Rum Rebellion , a coup mounted by its officers in 1808 . As a r[MASK]sult , i[MASK] January 1810 the 73rd ( Perths[MASK]ire ) Regiment of F[MASK]ot arrived in Australia . By 1870 , 25 British infan[MASK]ry regiments h[MASK]d served in Austral[MASK]a , as[MASK]had a small number of[MASK]artillery [MASK]nd[MASK]engineer u[MASK]its . 
 Although the primary role of[MASK]the British Army[MASK]was to protect the colo[MASK]ies against external attack , no actual threat ever material[MASK]sed . The British Army wa[MASK] instead used in policing , guarding convicts at penal institutions , co[MASK]ba[MASK]ing bushranging , putting d[MASK]wn convict rebellions — as [MASK]ccurred at Bathurst in 1830 — and to suppress Aboriginal[MASK]resistance to the extension of E[MASK]ropean settleme[MASK]t . Notably [MASK]ritish soldiers were involved in the[MASK]battle at the Eureka Sto[MASK]ka[MASK]e in 1854 on the Victorian[MASK]goldfields . Members of British regiments stationed in Australia also saw action in India , Afghanistan , New Zealand and the Sudan [MASK] 
 During th[MASK] early years of settlement the naval defence of [MASK]u[MASK]tralia was provided by detached Royal Navy units of the East Indies Station ,[MASK]based in Sydney . Howeve[MASK] , in 1859 Australia was established as a separate squadron under the command of a comm[MASK]dore , marking the first occasion that Royal Navy ships had been permanently stationed[MASK]in Australia . The[MASK]Royal Navy remained the primary naval force[MASK]in Australian waters until 1913 , when the Australia Station ceased and responsibility handed ov[MASK]r to the [MASK]oyal Australi[MASK]n Navy ; the Roya[MASK] Navy 's depots , doc[MASK]yards and structures were given to the Australian people . 
 
 = = = Frontier warfare , 1788 – 1934 = = = 
 
 The reaction[MASK] of the native Aboriginal inhabitants to the sudden arrival of British settlers in Australia were v[MASK]ried , but were inevitably hosti[MASK]e when the settler 's presence led to competition over resources , and to the occupation of the indigenous inhabitants ' lands . European diseases decimated Aboriginal popul[MASK]tions , and the occupation or destruction of lands and food resources sometimes led to starvat[MASK]on . By and large neither the British nor the Aborigines approached the conflict in an organised sense and conflict occurred between groups of settlers and individual tribes rather tha[MASK] systemati[MASK] warfare . At times , howe[MASK][MASK]r , the frontier wars[MASK]did see the involvement of British soldiers and later mounted pol[MASK]ce units . Not all Aboriginal groups resisted white encroachment on their lands , while many Aborigines served in mounted police [MASK]nits and were involved in attacks on other tribes . 
 Fight[MASK]ng between Aborigines and Europeans was localised a[MASK] the Aborigines did not form confederations capable of sus[MASK]ained resistance . As a result , there was not a single war , but rather a series of violent engagements and massacres across the continent . Organised or disorganised however , a pattern of frontier warfare emerged with Aboriginal resistance beginning in the 18th century and continuing into the early 20th century[MASK]. This warfare contradicts t[MASK]e popular and at times academic " myth " of peaceful settlement in Australia . Faced wi[MASK]h Aboriginal resistance settlers often reacted with viole[MASK]ce , resulting in a number of indiscriminate massacres . Among[MASK][MASK]he [MASK]ost famous is the Battle of Pinjarra [MASK]n Western Australia in 1834 [MASK] Such incidents were not o[MASK]f[MASK]cially sanctioned however[MASK], and after t[MASK]e Myall Creek ma[MASK]sacre in New South[MASK]Wales in 1838 seven Europeans were han[MASK]ed for their[MASK]part in the[MASK]killings . However , in Tasmania the so @-@ called Black War was [MASK]ought between 1828 and 1832 , and aimed at driving most of the [MASK]sland 's native inhabi[MASK]an[MASK]s onto a number of isolated peni[MASK]sulas . Although it began in failure for the British , it ultimately resulted in considerable casualties[MASK]amongst the native population . 
 It may be inaccurate though to depict the conflict a[MASK] one sided and mainly perpetrated by Europeans on Aborigines . Although many more Aborigines died than British , this may have had more to do with the technological and logistic advantages enjoyed by the Europeans . Aboriginal tactics varied , but were mainly based on pre @-[MASK] existing hunting and fighting pract[MASK]ces — using spears , clubs and other primitive weapons . Unlike the indigenous peoples of New Zeal[MASK]nd and [MASK]orth America , on the main Aborigines failed to adapt to meet the challenge of the Europeans . Although there were some instances of in[MASK]ividuals and gr[MASK]ups acquiring and usin[MASK] firearms , this wa[MASK] not wides[MASK]read . The Aborigines were never a serious military threat to European settlers , regardless of how much the settlers may have feared them . On occasio[MASK]s large [MASK]roups [MASK]f Aborigines attacked the[MASK]settlers in open terrain and [MASK] conventional battle ensued , during which the[MASK]Aborigines would a[MASK]tempt to use superior [MASK]umbers to their advantage . This could sometimes be effective , with reports of [MASK]hem advancing in crescent formation in an attempt to outflank[MASK]and surround their opponents , waitin[MASK] out the first volley of shots and then hurling their sp[MASK]ars while the settlers reloaded . However , such open warf[MASK]re usually proved more costly fo[MASK][MASK]the Aborigines t[MASK]an the Europeans . 
 Central to the success of the Eu[MASK]opeans was [MASK][MASK]e use of firear[MASK]s .[MASK]How[MASK]ver , the advantages afforde[MASK] by firearms have often b[MASK]en overstated . Prior to[MASK]the late 19th century , firearms were often cumbersome muzzle @-@ loading , smooth @-@ bor[MASK] , single shot muskets with flint @-@ lock mechan[MASK]sms . Such weapons produced a low rate of fire , while suffering from a high rate of failure and were only accurate within 50 me[MASK]res ( 160 ft[MASK]) . These [MASK]eficiencies may have initially given the Aborigines an advantage , allowing them to move in close and engage with [MASK]pears or clubs . Yet [MASK]y 1850 significant advances in firearms gave the Europeans a distinct advantage , with the six @-@ shot Colt re[MASK]olver , t[MASK]e Snider single shot breech @-@ loading rifle and later the Mart[MASK]ni @-@ Henry rifle , as well as rapid @-@ fire rifles such as the Winchester rifle , becoming [MASK]vailable . These weapons , when used on open g[MASK]oun[MASK] and combined with the superior mobility provided by horses to surround and engage groups of Aborigines , often proved successful . The Europeans also had to adapt their tactics to [MASK]ight their fast @-@ moving , often hi[MASK]den enemies . Tactics employed included night @-@ time surprise a[MASK]tacks , and positio[MASK][MASK]ng f[MASK]rces to drive the natives off cliffs or force them to [MASK]etreat into rivers while attacking from both banks . 
 The conflict lasted for over 150 years and followed the patter[MASK] of British settlement in Australia . Beginning in New South Wales with the arrival of the first Euro[MASK]eans in Ma[MASK] 1788 , it continued in Sydney[MASK]and its surrounds until the 1820s . As the frontier moved west so did the conflict , pushing into outback New [MASK]outh Wal[MASK]s in th[MASK] 1840s . In Tasmania , fighting can be [MASK]raced from 1804 to the 1830s , while in Victoria and the southern parts of South Australia , the majority of the violence occurred[MASK]duri[MASK]g the 1830s and 1840s . The south @-@ west of Western Australia experienced warfare from 1829 [MASK]o 1850 .[MASK]The war in Queensland began in[MASK]the area around Brisbane in [MASK]he 1840s and continued until 1860 , moving to central Que[MASK]nsland in the 1850s and 1860s , and then to northern Queensland from the 1860[MASK] to 1900 . In Western Aus[MASK]ralia , the violence moved north with European settlement , reaching the Kimberley region by 1880 , with violent clashes continuing until the 1920s . In the Northern Territory conflict l[MASK]sted even later still , especially in central Australia , c[MASK]nt[MASK]nuing[MASK]from t[MASK]e [MASK]880s to the 1930s [MASK] One estimate of casualties plac[MASK]s Eur[MASK]pean deaths at 2 @,@ 500 , while at least 20 @,@ 000 Aborigines are believed to have perished . Far more devastating though was the effect of disease which significantly reduced th[MASK] Aboriginal population by the beginning o[MASK] the 20th[MASK]century ; a fact which may also have limited their ability to resist[MASK].

 = = = Colonial military forces , 1870 – 1901 = = = 
 
 From 1870 until 1901 , each of the six colonial governments was responsible for their [MASK]wn defence . The colonies had gained responsible government between [MASK]855 and 1890 , and while the Colonial Office i[MASK] London retained control of some affairs , the Governor of the ea[MASK]h colony was[MASK]require[MASK] to raise their own colonial militia . To do this , they were g[MASK]anted the authority from the Britis[MASK] crown to raise military and naval forces . Initially these were militia[MASK] in support of British regulars , [MASK][MASK]t when military support for the coloni[MASK]s ended in 1870 , the colonies assumed their [MASK]wn defence responsibiliti[MASK]s . Th[MASK] colonial milita[MASK]y forces inclu[MASK]ed unpaid volunteer militia , paid citizen s[MASK]ldiers , and a small permanent component . They were mainly infantry , cavalry and mounted infantry , a[MASK][MASK] were[MASK]neither housed in barrack[MASK] nor subj[MASK]ct to[MASK]full military discipline . Even[MASK]after si[MASK]nificant reform[MASK] in the 1870s —[MASK]including the expansion of the permanent forces to include engineer and arti[MASK]lery units — they remained too small and unbalanced to be con[MASK]idered armies i[MASK] the modern sense . By 18[MASK]5 , the forces numbered 21 @,@ 00[MASK] m[MASK]n . Although [MASK][MASK]ey cou[MASK]d not be compelled to serve overseas many volu[MASK]teers subsequently did see action in a number conflicts of the British Empire during the 19th century , with the colonies raising continge[MASK]ts to serve in Sudan , South Africa and China . 
 Despite a reputation o[MASK] colonial inferiority , many of th[MASK] locally raised units [MASK]ere highly organised ,[MASK]discip[MASK]ined , professional , and well trained . During this period , defences in Austra[MASK]ia mainly revolved around[MASK]static defenc[MASK] by combined infantry and artillery , based on garrisoned coastal [MASK]orts . However , by the 1890s , improved railway communications b[MASK]tween [MASK]he mainland eastern colonies led Major General James Edwards — who had recently completed a survey [MASK]f colonial military forces — t[MASK] the belief that [MASK]he colonies c[MASK]uld be defended by the rapid mobilisation of brigades of infantry .[MASK]As a consequence he called for a restructure of defences , and defensive agreements to be made between the colonies . Edwards argued for the colonial forces to be federated and for professional units — obliged to serve anywhere in the South Pacific — to replace the volunteer forces . [MASK]hese views found support in the influential New South Wales Commandant , Major General Edward Hutton , however suspicions held by the smaller colonies towards New South Wales and Victoria stifle[MASK] the proposal . These[MASK]reforms remaining unresolved however , and defence [MASK]ssues were generally given little attention in the debate on the political federation of the colonies . 
 With the exception of Western Australia , the colon[MASK]es also operated their own navies . [MASK]n 1856 , Vic[MASK]oria received its own[MASK]naval vessel , HMCSS Victoria , and its deployment to New Zea[MASK]and in 1860 during the First [MASK]aranaki War marked the first occasion that an Aust[MASK]al[MASK]an warship had been deployed ov[MASK]rseas . The colonial navies were expanded greatly in the mid @-@ 1880s and consisted of a numb[MASK]r of gunboats and torpedo @-@ boats for the defence of ha[MASK]bours and rivers[MASK], as well as naval brigades to man vessels and fo[MASK]ts . Victoria[MASK]b[MASK]came the most powerful of all the [MASK]olonial navies , with the ironclad HMVS Cerberus in service from 1870 , as well as the steam @-@ sail warship [MASK]MS Nelson on loan from the Royal Navy , three small gunboats and[MASK]five torpedo @-@ boats . New South Wales formed a Naval Brigade in 1863 and by the sta[MASK]t of the 20th century had two small torpedo @-@ boats[MASK]and a corvette . The Queensland Maritime Defence For[MASK]e was established i[MASK] 1885 , while South Australia operated a single ship , [MASK]MCS Protector . Tasmania had[MASK]also a small Torpedo Corps , while Western Australia 's only naval defences included the Fremantle Naval Ar[MASK]illery . Naval personnel from New South Wales and Victoria took part in the suppression of the Boxer Rebellion in China in 1900 , while HMCS Protector was sent by South Austral[MASK]a but saw no action .[MASK]The separate [MASK]olonies maintained control over their military and naval forces until Federation in 1901 , when th[MASK]y were amalgamated and placed under the control of the new Commonwealth of Australia . 
 
[MASK]= = = Sudan , 1885 = = = 
 
 During the early years of the 1880s , an Egyptian regime in the [MASK]udan , backed by [MASK][MASK]e British , came under threat from rebellion under the leadership of native Muha[MASK]mad Ahmad ( or Ahmed ) , known as Mahd[MASK] to his fol[MASK]owers . In 1883 , as part of the Mahdist War , the Egyptians sent an army to deal wit[MASK] the revolt , but they were defeated and faced a diffi[MASK][MASK]lt campaign o[MASK] extracting their[MASK]forces . The[MASK]British instru[MASK]t[MASK]d the Egy[MASK]tians to abandon the Sudan , a[MASK]d sent General Charles Gordon to co @-@ ordinate the evacuation , but he w[MASK]s killed in January[MASK]1885 . When news of his death arrived in New South Wales in February 1885 , the go[MASK]ernment offered to send fo[MASK]ce[MASK] and meet the contingent 's expenses . The New South Wales Contingent co[MASK]sisted of an infantry bat[MASK]alion[MASK]of 522 men[MASK]and 24 officers , and an artillery battery of [MASK]12 men a[MASK]d sai[MASK]ed[MASK]from Sydney on 3 Marc[MASK] 1885 . 
 The contingent arrived in Suakin on 29 March a[MASK]d were attached [MASK]o a brigade that consisted of Scots , Grenadier and Coldstream Guar[MASK]s . They subsequ[MASK]n[MASK]ly marched for Tamai in a l[MASK]rge " square " formation made up of 10 @,@ 000 men . Reaching the village , they burned huts and returned to Suakin : three[MASK]Australians we[MASK]e wounded in mi[MASK]or fighting . Most of the contingent was then sent to work [MASK]n a railway line that was being laid across the desert towards Berber , on the Nile . The Australians were then assigned to guard duties , but soon a camel corps was raised and 50 men volunteered . They rode on a reconnaissance to Takdul on 6 M[MASK]y and were heavily involved in[MASK]a skirmish during which more than 100 Arabs were kill[MASK]d or captured . On 15 May , they made one last sortie to bury the dead from the fighting of the previo[MASK]s March . Meanwhile , the artillery were posted at Handoub and drilled for a month , but t[MASK]ey soon rejoined the camp at Suakin . 
 Eventually the B[MASK]itish gover[MASK]ment decided that[MASK]the campai[MASK]n in Sudan was not[MASK]worth the effort required and left a garrison in Suakin . The New South Wales Contingent sailed for home on 17 May ,[MASK]arriving in Sydney on 19 June 1885 . Approximat[MASK]ly 770 Australians served in Sudan ; nine subseque[MASK]tly died of disease during the return journey while three had been wounded during the campaign . 
 
 = = = Second Boer War , 1899 – 1902 = = = 
 
 British e[MASK]croachment into areas of South Africa already settled by the Afrikaner B[MASK]ers and the com[MASK]etition for resources and land that developed between them as a result , led to t[MASK]e Second Boer War in 1899 . P[MASK]e @-@ empting the deployment of British f[MASK]rce[MASK] [MASK] the Afrikaner Republics of the Orange Free State and the Transvaal Republic under President Paul Kruger[MASK]declared war on 11 October 1899 , striking deep[MASK]into the British te[MASK]ritories of Natal and the Cape Colony . After the outbreak of war , plans for the dispatch of a combined Australian force were subsequently set aside by the British War Office and each of the six colonial gover[MASK]ments sent separate contingents to serve w[MASK]th British formations , with two squadrons each of 125 men fr[MASK]m New South Wales a[MASK]d Victo[MASK]ia , and one each from the other colonies . The first troops a[MASK]rived [MASK]hree weeks later , with the New South Wales Lan[MASK]ers — who had been training in England before the war , hurriedly diverted to South A[MASK]rica . On 22 November , the Lancers came under fire for the fi[MASK]st time near Belmont , and they subsequently forced their attackers to wi[MASK]hdraw afte[MASK] inflicting significant casualties on them . 
 Following a series of minor victories , the British suffered a major setback during Black Week between 10 – 17 December 18[MASK][MASK] , although no Australian[MASK]units wer[MASK] involved [MASK] The first contingents of infantry from Victoria , South Australia , Western Australia , and Tasmania arrived in Cape Town on 26 November and were designated the Australian Regiment under the command of Colonel John Charles Hoad . With a need for increased mobility , they were soon converted into mounted infantry . Further units from Queensland and New South Wales arrived in December and were soon committed to the front . The first casualties occurred soon after at Sunnyside on 1 January 1900 , after 250 Quee[MASK]sland Mounted Infantry and a column of Canadian[MASK] , British and artillery attacked a Boer laager at Belmont . Troopers David McLeod and Victor Jones were killed when their patrol clashed with the Boer forward sentries . Regardless ,[MASK]the Boers were surprised and during two hours of heavy fighting , mor[MASK] than 50 were killed and anoth[MASK]r 40 taken prisoner . Five hundred Queenslanders and the New[MASK]South Wales Lancers subsequently took part in the S[MASK]ege of Kimberley in February 1900 . 
 Despite serious set @-[MASK] backs at Colenso , Stormberg[MASK], Magersfontein , and Spion Kop in January — and with Ladysmith s[MASK]ill under siege — the British mounted [MASK] five division cou[MASK]ter @-@ invasion of[MASK]the Orange Free State in February . The attacking force included a division of cavalry commanded by Lieutenant General John French with the New South Wales Lancers , Queensland Mounted Infantry an[MASK] New South Wales Army Medical Corps atta[MASK]hed . First ,[MASK]Kimberley was relieved foll[MASK]wing the [MASK]attles of Modder River and Magersfontein , and the retreating Boers defeated at Paardeberg , with the New South Wales Mounted Rifle[MASK] loc[MASK]ting the Boer general , Piet Cronjé . The British entered Bloemfontein on 13 March 1900 , [MASK]hile Ladysmith was relieved [MASK][MASK]Disease began to take its toll and scores of men died . Still the advance c[MASK]ntinued , with the drive to Pr[MASK]toria in May including more than 3 @,@ 000 Australian[MASK] . Johannesburg fell on 30 May , and the[MASK]Boers withdrew from Pretoria on[MASK]3 June . T[MASK]e New South W[MASK]les Mou[MASK]ted Rifles and Western Australians saw a[MASK]tion again at Di[MASK]mond Hill on 12 June . Mafeking was relieved[MASK]on 17 May . 
 Following th[MASK] defeat of the Afrikaner republics still the Boers held out , forming small commando units and conducting a campaign of guerrilla warfare to disrupt British troop movements and lines of supply . This new phase of resistance led to further recruiting in the Australian colonies and the raising of the Bushmen 's Contingents , with these soldier[MASK] usually being volunteers with horse @-@ riding and shooti[MASK]g skills , but[MASK]little military experience . After Federation in 1901 , eight Australian Commonwealt[MASK] Horse battalions of the newly created Australian Army w[MASK]re also sent to South Afri[MASK]a , a[MASK]t[MASK]ough they saw litt[MASK]e fighting [MASK]efore the war ended [MASK] Some Australians later jo[MASK]ned local South African irregular units , instead of returning home after discharge . These soldiers were part of the British Army , and were subject to B[MASK]it[MASK]sh military discipli[MASK]e . Su[MASK]h units included the Bushveldt Carbineers which gained notoriety a[MASK] the un[MASK]t in which Harry " Breaker " Morant and Peter Handcock served in before their court martial and execution f[MASK]r war crimes . 
 With the guerrillas requiring supplies , Koos[MASK]de la Rey lead a force of 3 @,@ 000 Boers against Brakfontei[MASK] , on the Elands River in Weste[MASK]n Transvaal . The post held a large quantity of stores and was defended by 300 Australians and 200 Rhodesia[MASK]s .[MASK]The attack began on 4 August 1900 with[MASK]heavy shelling causing 32 casualties . During the night the d[MASK]fenders dug in , en[MASK]uring shelling and rifle fire .[MASK]A relief force was stopped by the Boers , while a second column turned back believing tha[MASK] the post had alread[MASK] been re[MASK]ieved . The siege lasted 11 days , during which more than 1 @,@ 800 shells were fired into [MASK]he post . After calls to surrender were ignored by [MASK]he[MASK]defenders , [MASK]nd not prepared to risk a frontal attack , the Boers [MASK]ventually retired . The Siege of Elands[MASK]River w[MASK]s one of the major achievements of the Australi[MASK]ns during the war , with the[MASK]post finally relieved on 16 August . 
 In response[MASK]the British adopted counter @-@ insurgency tacti[MASK]s ,[MASK]including a scorch[MASK]d earth policy involving the bur[MASK]ing of houses and crops , the establishment of co[MASK]centration camps for Boer women and children ,[MASK]and a system of blockhouses and field obstacles to limit Boer mobility and t[MASK] protect railway[MASK]communications . Such measures required considerable expenditure , a[MASK]d caused much bitterness towards the British , however they soon yielded results . By m[MASK]d @-@ 1901 , the bulk of the fighting was over , and British mounted units would ride at night to attack Boer farmhouses or encampments , overwhelming them with superior numbers . Indicative [MASK]f warfare in last months of 1901 , the New South Wales Mounted Rifles travelled 1 @,@ 814 miles ( [MASK] @,@ 919 km ) and were involved in 1[MASK] skirmishes , killing 2[MASK] Boers , woundi[MASK]g 15 , and capturing[MASK]196 for the loss of five dea[MASK] and 19 wounded . Other notable Australi[MASK]n actions included Slingersfontein , Pink Hill , Rhenosterkop and Haartebeestefontein . 
 Australians were not [MASK]lways successful however , suffering a number of heavy losses late in the war . On 12 June 1901 , the 5th [MASK]ictorian Mounted Rifles lost 19 killed and 42 wounded at Wilmansrust , near Middleburg after poor sec[MASK]rity allowed a force of 150 Boers to surprise[MASK]them . On 30 October 1901 , Victorians of the Scottish Horse Regiment also suffered heavy casualties at Gun Hill , al[MASK]hough 60 Boers were also[MASK]k[MASK]lled in the engagement [MASK] Meanwhile , at Onverwacht on 4 January 1902 , the 5th Quee[MASK]sland Imperial Bushmen lost 13 killed and 17 wounded . Ultimately the Boers were defeated , and the war ended on 31 May 1902 . In al[MASK] 16 @,@ 175 A[MASK]stralians served in S[MASK]ut[MASK] Africa , and perhaps[MASK]another 10 @,@ 000 enlisted as individuals in Imperial units ; casualties included 25[MASK] killed in action , 267 died of diseas[MASK] and 43 missing in action ,[MASK]while a further[MASK]735 were wounded .

 The Boxe[MASK] Rebell[MASK]on in China began in 1900 , and a number of western nations — including many European powers , the United [MASK]tates , and Japan — soon sent forces as part of the China Field Force to protect their[MASK]interests . In Ju[MASK]e , the British government sought permission from the Australian colonies to dispatch ships from the Australian Squadron to China . T[MASK]e colon[MASK]es also offered to assist further , but as most of their troops were still engaged in[MASK]South Africa , they had to rely on naval forces f[MASK]r manpower . The force dispatched was a modest one[MASK], wit[MASK][MASK]Britain accepting 200 men fr[MASK]m Victoria , 260 from New South [MASK]ales and the South Aus[MASK]ralian ship HMCS Protector , under the command of Cap[MASK]ain [MASK]illiam Cresw[MASK]ll .[MASK]Most of these forces[MASK]were made up of naval brigade reservists , who had been trained in both ship handling and soldiering to fu[MASK]fil their coastal defence role . Amongst the naval contingent from New South Wales were 200 naval officers and[MASK]sailors and 50 permanent sold[MASK]ers headquartered at Victoria Barracks , Sydney who originally enlisted for the Second Boer War . The soldiers were keen [MASK]o [MASK]o to Chi[MASK]a but refused to be enlisted as sailo[MASK]s [MASK] wh[MASK]le the New South [MASK]ales Nava[MASK] Brigade objected to havin[MASK] soldiers in their [MASK]anks . The Army and Navy compromised and titled the contingent the NSW Marine Light Infan[MASK]ry . 
 The contingents from New South Wales and Victoria sailed for China on [MASK] August 1900 . Arriving in Tientsin , the Austral[MASK]ans provided 300 men to [MASK]n 8 @,@ 000 @-@ strong multinational force tasked with capturing the Chinese forts at Pei Tang , which dominated a key railway . They arrived too l[MASK]te to take part in the battle , but were involved in the attack on the fortress at Pao @-@ ting Fu , where the Chinese government was believed to have foun[MASK] asylum after[MASK]Peking was captured by western forces . The Victorians joined a force o[MASK] 7 @,@ 500 men on a ten @-@ day march to the fort , [MASK]nce again only to find that [MASK]t had already surre[MASK]dered .

They left China in March 1901 , having played only a minor role in a few offensives and punitive expedit[MASK]ons and in the restoration of civil order . Six Australians died from sickness and injury , but none were killed as a result of enemy action .

 = = Australian military forces at Federation , 1901 = = 
 
 The Commonwealth of Australia came into existence on 1 [MASK]anuary 1901 as a resu[MASK]t of the federation of[MASK]the Australian colonies . Under the Constitution of Australia , defence responsibility was [MASK]ow vested in the n[MASK]w federal government . The co @-@ ordination of Australia @-@ wide defensive efforts in the face of Imperial German interest in the Pa[MASK]ific Ocean was one of driving forc[MASK]s behind federalism , and the Department of Defence immediately came into being as a resu[MASK]t , while [MASK]he Commo[MASK]wealth Military Forces ( early forerunne[MASK] of the Australian Army ) and Commonwealth Naval Force were also soon established . 
 The Australian Commonwealth Military Forces came into being on 1 March 1901 and all t[MASK]e colonial forces — including those still in South Afric[MASK] — became part of the new force . 28 @,@ 923 colonial soldiers , including 1 @,@ 457 professional soldiers , 18[MASK]@,@ 603 paid militia and[MASK]8 @,@ 863 unpaid volunteers , were subsequently[MASK]transferred . The individual units continued to be administered under the various colonial A[MASK]ts until the Defence Act 1903 brought all the units under one piece of legislation .[MASK]This Act also prevented the raising of standing infantry units and specified that mi[MASK]itia forces could not be[MASK]used in industrial disputes or serve outside Australia . However , the majority of soldiers remained in militia units , known as the Citizen Military Forces ( CMF ) . Major General Sir Edward Hutton — a former commander of the New South Wales Military Forces — subse[MASK][MASK]ently became the first commander of the Commonwealth Military Forces on 26 December and set to [MASK]ork devising an integrated structure for the new army . In 1911 , following a report by Lord Kitchener the Royal Military College , Duntroon was established , as was a s[MASK][MASK]tem of universal National Service . 
 Prior to federation each self @-@ gov[MASK]rning co[MASK]ony had[MASK]opera[MASK]ed its own naval force . These navies were small[MASK]and lacke[MASK] blue water capabilities , forcing the separate colonies to subsidise the cost of a British naval squadron in their [MASK]aters for decades . The[MASK]colonies maintained control over their respectiv[MASK] navies until 1 March 1901 , when the Commonwealth Naval Force was created . [MASK]his new force also lacked blue wate[MASK] capable ships , and ul[MASK]imately did not lead to a change in Australian naval policy . In 1907 Prime Minister Alfred Deakin and Creswell , while attending[MASK]the Imperial Con[MASK]erence in London , sought the British Government 's agreement to end the subsidy system and deve[MASK]op an Aust[MASK]alian navy . The Admiralty rejected and resented the challenge , but suggested diplo[MASK]atically that a small fleet of destroyers and su[MASK]marines would be sufficient . Deakin was unimpressed , and in 1908 invited the American Great White Fleet to [MASK]isit Australia . This visit fired public enthusiasm[MASK]for a[MASK]mo[MASK]ern na[MASK]y and in part led to the order of two 700 @-@ ton River @-@ class destr[MASK]yers . The [MASK]urge in German [MASK]aval [MASK]onstruction prompted the Admiralty to change their position however and the Royal Australian Navy was subsequently formed in 1911[MASK], absorbing the Commonwealth Naval Force . On 4 October 191[MASK] , [MASK]he new fleet steamed t[MASK]rough Sydney Heads , consisting of the battlecruiser HMAS Australia , three light cruisers , and three destroyers , while several o[MASK]her ships were still under construction . [MASK]nd as a cons[MASK]quence the navy entered the First World War as a formidable [MASK]orce . 
 The Australian Flyin[MASK] Corps ( AFC ) wa[MASK] established as par[MASK] of the Commonwealth Military Forces in 1912 , prior to the formation of the Australian Mili[MASK][MASK]ry Forces in 1916 and was [MASK]ater s[MASK]parated in 1921 to form th[MASK] Royal Australian Air Force , making it the second oldest air force in the world . Regardless , the service branches were not [MASK]ink[MASK]d by [MASK] single chain of command however , and eac[MASK] reported to their own minister and had separate administrative arrangements and government departments .

 When Britain declared war on Germany at the star[MASK] of the First World War , the Australian govern[MASK]ent rapidly followed s[MASK]it , with Prime Minister Joseph Cook declaring on 5 August 1914 that "[MASK]...[MASK]when the Empire is at war , so also is Australia "[MASK]and[MASK]reflecting the sentiment of many [MASK]ustralians that any declaration of [MASK]ar by Britain[MASK]automatically included Australia [MASK] This was itself in part due to the large number of British @-@ born citiz[MASK]ns a[MASK]d first generation Anglo @-@ Australians that made up the Australian population at the time . Indeed , by [MASK]he end of the war almost 20 % of those who served in the Austral[MASK]an forces had been born in Britain . 
 As the existing militia forces were unable to serve overseas und[MASK]r the provisions of the D[MASK]fence Act 1903 , an all @-@[MASK]volunteer expeditionary force known as the Australian Imperial Force ( AIF ) was formed and recruitment began on 10 August 1914 . The government pledged 20 @,@ 000 men , organised as one infa[MASK]try division and one light horse brigade plus supporting units . [MASK]nlistment and organisation was primarily regi[MASK]nall[MASK] based and was [MASK]ndertaken under mobilisation plans drawn up in 1912 . The first commander was Major General William Br[MASK]dges , who also assumed command of the 1s[MASK] Division . Throughout the course of the conflict Australian efforts [MASK]ere predominantly focused upon the ground[MASK]war , although small air and naval forces[MASK]were also committed .

 Following the outbreak of war Australian forces moved quickly to reduce t[MASK]e threat to s[MASK]i[MASK]ping posed by the proximity of Germany 's Pacific colonies . The Australia[MASK] Naval and Military Expeditionary Force ( AN & MEF ) , a [MASK]000 @[MASK]@ man volunteer force — separate from the AIF — and consisting of an infantry [MASK]attalion plus 500 naval rese[MASK]vists and ex [MASK]-@ sailors , was rapidly formed under the command of [MASK]illia[MASK] Holmes . The objectives of the force were the wireless sta[MASK]ions[MASK]on Nauru , and [MASK]hose at Yap in the Ca[MASK]oline Islands , and at[MASK]Rabaul in German Ne[MASK] Guinea . The force reached Rabaul on 11 September 1914 and occupied it th[MASK] [MASK]ext day[MASK], encountering only b[MASK]ief resistance from the German and native defenders during fighting at Bita Paka and Toma . German New Guinea surrendered on 17 September 1914 . Australian losses were light , including six killed during the fighting , but were compounded by the mysterious loss offshore o[MASK] the submarine AE1 with all 35 men aboard .

 The AIF departed by ship in a single convoy from Albany on 1 Novembe[MASK] 1914 .

 Aiming to knock Turkey out of the war the British then decided to stage an amphibious lodgement at Gallipoli [MASK]n[MASK] following a period of training and reorganisation the Australians were included amon[MASK]st the British , Indian and French forc[MASK]s comm[MASK]tted to the campaign .

Although promising to transform the war if successful , the Gallipoli Campaign was ill [MASK]-@ conceived and ultimately lasted eight months of bloody stalemate[MASK], without achieving its objectives . Australian casualties totalled 26 @,@ 111 , including 8 @,@ 141 killed . 
 For Austral[MASK]ans and New Zealanders the Gallipoli campaign came to symbolise an important milestone in the emergenc[MASK] of both nations as independent actors on the worl[MASK] stage and the development of a sense of na[MASK]ional identity . Today , the date of the initia[MASK] landings , 25 April , is known as Anzac[MASK]Day in Australia a[MASK]d N[MASK]w Zealand and [MASK]very year thousands of [MASK]eople gather at memorials in both nations , as well as Turkey , to honour the bravery and sacrifice of the original Anzacs[MASK], and of all those who have subsequently lost their lives in war .

 After the withdrawal from Gallipoli the Aus[MASK]ralians returned to Egypt and the AIF underwent a major expa[MASK]sio[MASK] . In 1916 the in[MASK]antry began to move to France while the cavalry units remaine[MASK] in the Middle Ea[MASK]t to fight the Turks . Australian troops of the Anzac Mounted D[MASK]vision and the Australian Mounted Division saw action in all the major battles of the Sinai and Palesti[MASK]e Campai[MASK]n , playing a pivotal role in fighting the Turkish troops that were threatening British control of Egypt . The Australian 's first saw combat du[MASK]i[MASK]g the Senus[MASK]i uprising in the [MASK]ibyan Desert and the Nile Valley , during which the combined British forces[MASK]s[MASK]ccessfully pu[MASK] down the primitive pro @-@ Turkish Islamic sec[MASK] with heavy c[MASK]s[MASK]alties . The Anzac Mounted Division subsequently[MASK]saw considerable action in the Battle of Romani against the Turkish betwee[MASK] 3 – 5 August 1916 , with the Turks eventually pus[MASK]ed back . Following this victory the [MASK]ritish forces went on t[MASK]e offensive in the Sinai , although the pace of the advance was governed by the speed [MASK]y which the railway and water pipelin[MASK] could be constructed from the Suez Canal . Rafa was captu[MASK]ed on 9 January 1917 , while the last of the small Turkish garrisons in the Sinai were eliminat[MASK]d in February . 
 The advance entered Pale[MASK]tine and an initial , unsuccessful attempt was made to capture Gaza on 26 March 1917 , while a s[MASK]cond an[MASK] e[MASK]ually unsuccessful attempt was launched on 19 April . A[MASK]third assault occu[MASK]red between 31 October[MASK]and 7 November and this [MASK]ime bot[MASK] the Anzac Mounted Division and the Australian Moun[MASK]ed Divi[MASK]ion took part . The battle was a complete success for the British , over @-@ running the Gaza @-@ Beersheba line and capturing 12 @,@ 000 Turkish so[MASK]diers . The critical momen[MASK] was the capture of Beersheba on the first day , after the Australian 4th Light Horse Brigade charged more than 4 miles ( 6 @.@ 4 km ) . The[MASK]Turkish trenches were overrun[MASK], with the Austral[MASK]ans[MASK]capturing the wells [MASK]t Beers[MASK]eeba and securing t[MASK]e valuable water th[MASK]y contained along with over 700 prisoners f[MASK]r the loss of 31 kille[MASK] and 36 wounded . Later , Australian troops assisted in pushing the Turkish forces o[MASK]t of Palest[MASK]ne and took part in actions at Mu[MASK]har [MASK]idge , Jerusalem and the Me[MASK]iddo . The Turkish government surrende[MASK]ed on 30 October 1918 . Uni[MASK]s of the Light Horse were subsequently used to help put down a [MASK]ationalist revolt in Egypt in 1919 and did so with efficiency and brutality , although they su[MASK]fered a number of fatalities in the process . 
 Meanwhile , the AFC had undergone remarkable development , and its independen[MASK]e as a separate national force was unique among the Dominions . Deploying just a s[MASK]ngle aircraft to German New Gu[MASK]nea[MASK]in 1914 , the first operational flight did not occur until 27 May 1915 however , when the Mesopotamian Hal[MASK] Flight was called upon to assist in protecting British oil [MASK]nterests in Iraq . The AF[MASK] was soon expanded and four squadrons later saw actio[MASK] in Egypt , Palestine and on the Western Front , where they performed well .

 Five infantry divisions of the AIF saw action[MASK]in France and Bel[MASK]ium , leaving Egypt in March[MASK]1916 . I Anzac Corps subsequently took up positions in a qu[MASK]et sector south of Armentières on 7 April 1916 and for the next two and a half years the AIF participated in most of the major battles o[MASK] the Western Front , earning a formidable reputation . Although spared from the disastrous first day of the Battle of the Somme , within weeks four Australian divisions had been committed . The 5th Division , positioned on the left flank , was the first in action duri[MASK]g the Battle of Fromelles[MASK]on 19 July 1916 , [MASK]uffering 5 @,@ 533 casua[MASK]ties in a single day . The 1st Division entered the li[MASK]e [MASK]n 23 July , assaulting Pozieres , and by the time that they were relieved by the[MASK]2nd Division on 27 July , they had[MASK]suffe[MASK]ed 5 @,@ 286 casualties . Mouquet Farm was attacked in August [MASK] with casualties totalling 6 @,@ 300 men . By the time the AIF was withdrawn from the Somme to re @-@ organise , they had suffered 23 @,[MASK] 000 casualtie[MASK] in ju[MASK]t 45 days . 
[MASK]In March 1917 , the 2nd and 5th Divisions pursued the Germans back to the Hindenburg [MASK]ine[MASK], capturing the town of Bapaume . On 11 April , the 4th Division assaulted the [MASK]indenburg Line in the disastrous First Battle of Bullecourt , losing over 3 @,@ 000 casual[MASK]ies and 1 @,@ 170 captured . On 15 April , the 1st and 2nd Div[MASK]sions were counter @-[MASK] attacked near Lagnicourt and were forced to abandon the town , before recapturing it[MASK]again . The 2nd Divisio[MASK] then took part in the Second Battle of Bullecourt , beginning on 3 May[MASK], and succeeded in taking se[MASK]tions of[MASK]the Hindenburg[MASK]Line and holding them until relieved by the 1st Division . Finally , on 7 May the 5th Division relie[MASK]ed the 1st , [MASK]emaining in the line un[MASK]il the battle ended in mid @-@ May . Combined these efforts cost 7 @,@ 482 Australian casualties . 
 On 7 June 1917 , the II [MASK]nzac Corps — along with two B[MASK]itish corps — launched an operation[MASK]in Flanders to eliminate a salient south of Ypres . The attack commenced with the detonation of a mil[MASK]ion pounds ( 454 @,@ 545 k[MASK] ) of explosives that had b[MASK]en placed underneath the Messines ridge , destroying t[MASK]e German trenches . The advance was virtually unopposed , and despite strong German counterattacks the next day , it succeeded . Australian casual[MASK]ies during[MASK]the Ba[MASK]tle of Messines included nearly 6 @,@ 800 men . I Anzac Corps then took par[MASK] in the Third Battle of Ypres in Belgium as part of the campaign to capture the Gheluv[MASK]lt Plateau , bet[MASK]een Sept[MASK]mber and November 1917 . Individual actions took pla[MASK]e at Menin Road [MASK] Polygon Wood , Broodseinde , Poelcap[MASK]elle and Passchendaele and over the course of eight weeks fighting th[MASK] Australians suffered 38 @,@ 000 casualties . 
 On 21 [MASK]arch 1918 the German Army launched its Spring[MASK]Offensive in a last @-@ ditched ef[MASK]ort to win the war , unlea[MASK]hing sixty @-@ three divisions over a 70 miles ( 110 km[MASK][MASK] front . A[MASK] the [MASK]llies fell back the 3rd a[MASK]d 4th Divisions were rushed south to Amiens on the Somme . The offen[MASK]ive lasted for the next five months and all five AIF divisions in [MASK]rance were engaged in th[MASK] attempt to stem the tide . By late May th[MASK] Germans had pushed to within 50 miles ( 80 km ) of Paris . During this time the Australians fought at Dernacourt , Morlancourt , Villers @-@ Bretonneux , Hangard Wood , Hazebrouck , and Hamel . At Hamel the commander of the Australian Corps , Lieutenant General John[MASK]Monash , successfully used combined arms — including aircraft , artillery and armour — in [MASK]n attack for th[MASK] first time . 
 The German offensive ground to[MASK]a halt in mid @-@ July and a [MASK]rief lull follow[MASK]d , during which the Australians undertook a ser[MASK]es of r[MASK]ids , known as Peaceful Penetrations . The Allies soon launched thei[MASK] own offensive — [MASK]he Hundred Days Offensive — ultimatel[MASK] ending the war . Beginning on 8 August 1918 the offensive included four Austr[MASK]lian divisions str[MASK]king at Amiens . Using the combined arms techniques developed earlier at Hamel , significant gai[MASK]s were made on what became known as the " Black Day " of the German Army . The offensi[MASK]e continued for four months , and during Second Battle of th[MASK] Somme the Australian Corps fought actions at Lihons , Etine[MASK]em , Proyart , Chuignes , and Mont St Quentin , before their [MASK]inal engagement of the war on 5 October 1918 at Montbrehain . The AIF was subsequently out of the line when the armistice was declared on 11[MASK]November 1918 . 
 In[MASK]all 416 @,@ 806 Australi[MASK]ns [MASK]nlisted in the AIF during the [MASK]ar and 333 @,@ 000 served overseas . 61 @,@ 508 were kille[MASK] and another 155 @,@ 000 were wounded ( a total casualty rate of 65 % ) . The financial cost to the Australian government was calculated at £ 376 @,@ 9[MASK]3 @,@ 052 . Two referendums on [MASK]onscription for overseas[MASK]service had been defeated during the war , preserving the volunteer status of the Australian force , but stretching the reserves of m[MASK]npower available , particularly to[MASK]ards the end of[MASK]the fighting . Consequently , Australia remained one of only two armies on eith[MASK]r[MASK]side not to resort to conscription during the war . [MASK] The war had a profound effect on Australian society in other ways also . Indeed , for many Australians the nation 's involvement is seen as[MASK]a symbol of its emergence as an international actor , whi[MASK]e many of the notions of Australian character and nationhood that exist today have their origins in the war . 64 Australians were awarded the[MASK]Victoria Cros[MASK] during the First World War .

 The Russian Civil War began after the Russian provisional government collapsed and the Bolshevik party assumed power in October 1917 [MASK] Following th[MASK] end of the First World War , the western powers — incl[MASK]ding Britain — intervened , giving half @-@ hearte[MASK] support to the pro @-@ [MASK]sarist , anti @-@ Bo[MASK]shevik White Russian forces . Although the Aust[MASK]alian gover[MASK]m[MASK]nt refu[MASK]ed to commit forces , many Australians serving with the British Army became involved in the[MASK]fighting . A small number served as advisors to White Russian units with the Nort[MASK] Russian Expeditionary Forc[MASK] ( NREF ) . Awaiting repatriation in Eng[MASK]and , about 150 Australians subsequently enlisted in the British North Russia Relief Force ( NRRF ) , where t[MASK]ey were in[MASK]olved in a number of sharp battles and several were killed . 
 The Royal Australian Navy destroyer HMAS Swan was also briefly engaged , carrying out [MASK]n intelligence gathering mission in the Black Sea i[MASK] late 1918 . Other Aust[MASK]alians served as advisers with the British Militar[MASK] Mission to the White Russian Ge[MASK]eral , Anton D[MASK]nikin in [MASK]outh Russia , while several more advised Admiral Aleksandr Kolchak in Siberia . Later , they als[MASK] served in Mesopotami[MASK] as part of Dunsterforce and the Malleson Mission , although these [MASK]issions were aimed at prevent[MASK]n[MASK] Turkish access to the Middle East and India , and did little fighting . 
 Although the motivatio[MASK]s of those Australian 's that volunteered to fight in Russia can only be guessed at , it seems unlike[MASK]y to ha[MASK]e been political . Regardless , they confirmed a rep[MASK]tation for audacity and coura[MASK]e , winning the only two Victoria Crosses of the land campaign , despite their[MASK]small numbe[MASK]s . Yet Australian involvement was ba[MASK]ely noticed at home at the time and made little difference to the outcome[MASK]of the war . Total casualties included 10 killed and 40 wounded , with most deaths being from disease during op[MASK]rations in Mesopotamia .

 A small number of Austra[MASK]ian volunteers fought on both sides of the Spanish Civil War [MASK] although they predominantly supported the Spanish Republic through the International Brigades . The Australians were su[MASK]sequently allocated to the battalions of other nationalities , such as the Brit[MASK]sh Battalion and the Lincoln Battali[MASK]n , rather than forming their own units . Most were[MASK]radicals motivated by ideological reasons , while a number were [MASK][MASK]anish @-@ born migrants who returned to fight in their country of ori[MASK]in . At least 66 Australians volunteered , with only one — Nugent Bull , a conservative catholic who[MASK]was la[MASK]er killed serving in the RAF during [MASK]he Second World War — known to have fought for General[MASK]Francis[MASK]o Franco 's N[MASK]tionalist forces . 
[MASK]While a celebrated caus[MASK] for the Australian left — parti[MASK]ularly the Communist Party[MASK]of Australia and the trade union movement — the war failed to s[MASK]ark particular public interest and the government maintained its neutrality . Australian opposition to the Republican cause was marshalled by B.A. Santamaria on an anti @-@ communist basis , rather than a pro @-@ [MASK]a[MASK]ionalist basis . Equally , although individual right wing Australia[MASK]s may hav[MASK] served with the Nationalist rebels , they received no public support . Service in a foreign armed force was illegal at the t[MASK]me , however as the government received no reports of Australians travelling to Spain to enlist , no action was taken . Consequently , returned veterans were neither recogn[MASK]sed by the[MASK]gover[MASK]ment or the [MASK]eturned and Servic[MASK]s League of Australia ( RSL ) . Although the number of Australian volunteers was relatively small compared to those from other countries , at least 14 were killed .

 Australia entered the Second World W[MASK]r on 3 September 1939 . At the time of the dec[MASK]aration of war against Germany the Australian military was small a[MASK]d un[MASK]eady for war . Recruiting for a Second Austr[MASK]lian Imperial Force ( 2nd AIF ) b[MASK]gan in mid @-@ September . While there was no rush of volunteers like the Fi[MASK]st World War , a high proportion of Australian men of military age had enlisted b[MASK] mid @[MASK]@ 1940 . Four infantry divisions were formed during 19[MASK]9 and 1940 , three of which w[MASK]re dispatched to the Middle East . The RAAF 's res[MASK]urces were initially mainly devoted [MASK]o training airmen for service with the Commonwealth air forces through the Empire Air Training Scheme ( EATS ) , through which almost 28 @,@ 000 Australians were trained during the [MASK]ar . 
 The Au[MASK]t[MASK]alian military 's first major engagements of the war were ag[MASK]inst It[MASK]lian forces in the Mediterranean and North Africa . During 1940 the light cruiser HMAS Sydney and five elderly destroyers ( [MASK]ubbed the "[MASK]Scrap Iron Flotilla " by Nazi Propaganda Minister Joseph Goebbels — a title proudly accepted by the ships ) took part in a series of operations as part of the British Mediterranean[MASK]Fleet , and sank several Italian warships . The Army fi[MASK]st saw action in January 1941 , when the 6[MASK]h Division formed p[MASK]rt of the Commonwealth fo[MASK][MASK]es during Operation Compass .[MASK]The division assaulte[MASK] and captured Bardia on 5 January and Tobruk on 2[MASK] January , with tens of thousands of Italian troops surrendering at both towns . The 6th Division took[MASK]part in the pursuit of the Italian Army[MASK]and captured Ben[MASK]hazi on 4 F[MASK]bruary . In late February it was withdrawn for service [MASK]n Gree[MASK]e , and was[MASK]replaced by the[MASK]9th Division [MASK] 
 The Aus[MASK]ralia[MASK] f[MASK]rces in the Mediterranean endured a number of campaigns during 1941 . During April , the 6th Divisi[MASK]n , other elements of I Corps and several Australian warships formed part of the Allied force which unsuccessfully at[MASK]empted [MASK]o defend Greece from German invasion during the Battle of Greece . At the end of this campaign , the 6th Division was evacuated to Egypt and Crete . The force at Crete subsequently fought [MASK]n the Battle of Crete during Ma[MASK] , which also ended in defeat for the Allies . Over 5 @,@ 000 Australians were capture[MASK] in these campaigns , and the 6th Division required a long period of rebuilding before it was again re[MASK]dy for combat . The Germans and Italians also went on the offensive in North Africa at the end of March and drove the Commonwealth force there back to near[MASK]the border with Egypt . T[MASK]e 9th Division and a brigade[MASK]of the 7th Division were besieged at Tobruk ; successfully defending the key por[MASK] town until they[MASK]were replaced by British units in October . During June , the main body of the 7th Division , a brigade of the 6th Division and the I Corps headquarters took part in the Syria[MASK]@-@ L[MASK]banon Campaign again[MASK]t the Vichy French . Resistance was stronger than expected ; Austra[MASK]ians were involved in most of the fighting and sustained most of the[MASK]casualties before the French capitulated in[MASK]early July . 
 The majority of Australia[MASK] units in the Mediterranean returned to Australia in early 1942 , after the outbreak of the Pacific W[MASK]r . The 9th Division was the largest unit to remain in the Middle East , and played a key role in the First Battle of El[MASK]Alamein during June and[MASK]the Second Battl[MASK] of El Alamein in October . The division returned to Australia in early 1943 , but several RAAF squadrons and RAN warships took part[MASK]in [MASK]he subsequent Tunisia Campaign and the Italian Ca[MASK]paign from 1943 until the end of the war . 
 The RAAF 's role in the strategic air offensive in Europe formed [MASK]ustralia 's main contribution to the defeat of Germany . Approximately 13 @,@ 000 Australian air[MASK]en served in dozens of [MASK]r[MASK]tish and five Australian squadrons in RAF Bomber Command between 1940 and the end of the w[MASK]r . Australians took part in all of Bomber Command 's ma[MASK]or offensives and suffered heavy losses [MASK]uring raids on [MASK]erman cities and targets in France . Au[MASK]tralian aircrew in Bomber[MASK]Command had one of the high[MASK]st casualty rates of[MASK]any part of the Australian military during the Second World War and sustained almost 20 percent of all Australia[MASK] deaths in combat ; 3 @,@ 486 were kil[MASK]ed and hundreds [MASK]ore were taken prisoner . Australian airmen in light bomber and fighter squadrons also participated in the liberation of Western Europe during 1944 and 1945 and t[MASK]o RAAF maritime patrol squ[MASK]drons served in the Battle of the Atlantic . 
 
 = = = Asia and the Pacif[MASK]c = = = 
 
 From the 1920s Australia 's defence thinking was dominated [MASK]y British Imperial defence policy , which wa[MASK] embodied by the " Singapore stra[MASK]egy " . This strategy involved the construction and defence of a major n[MASK]val base at[MASK]Singapore from which a large British fleet would respond to Japanese a[MASK]gression in the region . To this end , a high [MASK]roportion of Australian forces in Asia were concentrated[MASK]in Malaya during 1940 and 1941 as the[MASK]threat from Japan incr[MASK]ased . However , as a result of the emphasis on co @-@ operation with Britain , [MASK]elatively few Australian military units had been retained i[MASK] Australia and the [MASK]sia @-@ Pacific region . Measures were taken to improve Australia 's defences as war with Japan loomed in 1941 , but these [MASK]roved inadequate . In Decem[MASK]er 1941 , the Australian Army in the Pacific comprised the 8th Division , most of w[MASK]ich was stationed in Malaya , and eig[MASK]t partially trained and equipped divisions in Australia . [MASK]he RAAF was equipped with 373 aircraft , most of which were obsolete trainers , and the RAN had three cruis[MASK]rs and two destroyers in Australian waters . 
 The Australian military suffered a series of defeats during the early mo[MASK]ths of the Pacific War . The 8th Division and RAA[MASK] squadrons in Malaya formed a part of the Briti[MASK]h Commonwealth forces which were unable to stop a smaller Japanese invasion f[MASK]rce w[MASK]ich[MASK]landed on 7 December . The British Commonwealth force withdrew to Singap[MASK]re at the end of January , but was force[MASK] to surrender on 15 Febr[MASK]ary after the Jap[MASK]nese captured much of the island . Sm[MASK]l[MASK]er Australian forces were also overwhelmed and defeated during early 1942 at Rabaul ,[MASK]a[MASK]d in Ambon , Timor , and Java . The Australian town of Darwin was heavi[MASK]y bombed by t[MASK]e Japanese on 19 February , to prevent it from being used as an Allied base . Ove[MASK] 22 @,@ 000 Australians were taken prisoner in e[MASK]rly 1942 and endured harsh conditions [MASK]n Japanese captivity . The prisone[MASK]s were subjected to malnutrition , denied medical treatment and frequently[MASK]beaten and killed by their guards . As a result , 8 @,@ 29[MASK] Australian prisoners died in captivity . 
 The rapid Allied defeat in the Pacific caused many Australians to fear that the Japanese would invade the Australian mainland . While elements of the Imperial Japanese Navy p[MASK]oposed this in early 1942 , it was judged to be impossible by the Japan[MASK]se Imperial General Headquarters , which instead adopted a strategy of isolating Australia from the United States by capturing New Guinea ,[MASK]the Solomon Islands , Fiji , Samoa , and New Caledonia .[MASK]This fact was not known by the Allies at the time , and the Australian military was greatly expanded to meet the threat[MASK]of invasion . Large number[MASK] of United States Army and Army Air Forces units arrived in Australia in early[MASK]1942 , and the Australian military was placed under the overall command of Gener[MASK]l Douglas MacArthur in March . 
 Australians played a ce[MASK]tral role i[MASK] the New Guinea campaign during 1942 and 1943 . After an a[MASK]tempt to land troops at Port Moresby was d[MASK]feated in the Battle of the Coral Sea , the Japanese attempted[MASK]to capture the strategically important town by advancing overl[MASK]nd across the Owen Stanle[MASK] Ranges and M[MASK][MASK]ne Bay . Australian Army units defeated these offensives[MASK]in the Kokoda Track campaign and Battle of Milne Bay [MASK]ith the [MASK]upport of the RAAF and USAAF . Australian a[MASK]d US Army units subsequently assaulted and captured the Japanese bases on the north coast of Papua in the hard @-@ fought Battle of Buna @-@ Gona . The Australian Army also defeated a Japanese attempt to capture the town of Wau in January 1943 and went onto the offensive in the Salamaua @-@ Lae campaign in April . In late 1943 , the 7th and 9th Divisions played an important role in Operation Cartwheel , when they landed to the east and west of Lae a[MASK]d secured the Huon Peninsula during t[MASK]e Huon Peninsula campaign and Finisterre Range campaign . 
 The Australian main[MASK]and came under attack during 1942 and 1943 . Japanese submarines operated off Australia from May to August 1942 and January to June 1943 . T[MASK]e[MASK][MASK] attacks so[MASK]ght to cut the Allied sup[MASK]ly lines between Australia and the US and Australia and New [MASK]uinea , but were unsucce[MASK]sful . Japanese aircraft also conducted air raid[MASK] ag[MASK][MASK]nst Allied bases in northern Aust[MASK][MASK]lia whi[MASK]h were being used to mount the North Western Area Campai[MASK]n against Japanese positions in the Netherlands East Indies ( NEI ) . 
 Australia 's role in the Pacific W[MASK]r decline[MASK] from 1944 . The increasing size of the US forces in the Pacific rendered the Australia[MASK] military superfluous and labour [MASK]hortages forced the Governm[MASK]nt [MASK]o reduce the size of the armed forces to boost war production . N[MASK]vertheless , the Govern[MASK]ent wanted the Australian military to remain active , and agreed to MacArthur 's proposals that [MASK]t be used in relativ[MASK]ly unimportant campaigns . In late 1944 , Australian troops[MASK]and RAAF squadrons replaced US garrisons in eastern New Guinea , New Britain , and Bougainville , and launched offensives aimed at destroying or cont[MASK]ining the remaining J[MASK]pan[MASK]se forces ther[MASK] . In May 1945 , I[MASK]Corps , the Australian First Tactical Air Force and USAAF and USN units began the Borneo Campaign , wh[MASK]ch continued until the end of the war . These cam[MASK]aigns contributed li[MASK]tle to Japan 's defeat and remain controversial . 
 Following Japan 's surr[MASK]nder on 15 August 1945 Australia assumed re[MASK]ponsibility for occupying much of Borneo and the eastern Netherlands East Indies until British and Dutch colonial rule was restored[MASK]. Australian authorities also conducted a number of[MASK]war crimes trials of Japanese personnel . 993 @,@ 000 Australians enlisted during the war , while 557 @,@ 000 served overseas . Casualties included 39 @,@ 767 killed and another 66 @,@ 553 [MASK]ere [MASK]ounded . 20 Victoria Crosses were awarded to Australians .

 The demobilisation of the Australian military following the end of the Second World W[MASK]r wa[MASK] c[MASK]mpleted in[MASK]1947 . Plans for post @-@ [MASK]ar defence a[MASK]rangements were predicated on maintainin[MASK] a relatively strong peacetime force .

The Royal Australian Air Force would have a stre[MASK]gth of 16 squadrons , including four manned by the Citizen Air Force . Meanwhile , in a significant departure from previous Australian defence policy whi[MASK]h had previously relied on citizen forc[MASK]s , the Au[MASK]tralia[MASK] Army would in[MASK]lude a[MASK]permanent field force of 19 @,@ 000 regulars organised into a brigade of thre[MASK] infantry battalions with armoured support[MASK], serv[MASK]ng alongside a part @-@ time force of 50 @,@ 000 men in the Citizen Military Forces .

At its height in 1946 the Australian component [MASK]onsisted of an infantry brigade , four warships and three fighter squadrons , totalling 13 @,@ 500 personnel . The Australian Army component initially[MASK]consisted of the 34th Brigade which arrived in Japan in February 1946 and was based in Hiroshima Prefecture [MASK] The three i[MASK][MASK]antry battalions raised fo[MASK] occupation duties were designated the 1st , 2nd and 3rd battalions of the Royal Australian Regiment in 1949 , and the 34th Brigade became the 1st Brigade when it retu[MASK]ned to Au[MASK]tralia in December 1948 , forming the basis of the post @-@ war Regular Army . From that time the Australian Army[MASK]contributio[MASK] to the occupation of Japan was reduced to a single under @-@ strength battalion .

The RAAF component consisted of Nos. 76 , 77 [MASK]n[MASK] 82 Squadrons a[MASK] part of No. 81 Wing RAAF flying P @-[MASK] 51 Mustangs , initially based at Bofu from March 1946 , before transferring to [MASK]wakuni in 1948 . However , by 1[MASK]50 [MASK]nly No. 77 Squadron remained in Japan . A total of ten R[MASK]N warships served in Japan during this period , including HMA Ships Australia , Hobart , Shr[MASK]pshire , Arunta , Bataan , Culgoa , Murchison , Shoalhaven ,[MASK]Quadrant and Quiberon , while HMAS Ships Manoora , Westralia and Kanim[MASK]la also provided suppo[MASK]t .

 During the early years of the Cold War , Australian defence planning assumed that in the event of the outbreak o[MASK] a global war between the Western world and Eastern bloc countries[MASK]it would n[MASK]ed to contribute forces und[MASK]r collective security arr[MASK]ngements [MASK]s part of the United Nations , o[MASK] a coalition led by either the United States or Britain . The Middle East was consider[MASK]d the most likely area of operations [MASK]or Australian forces , where they would most likely operate with British forces . Early commitments included the involvement of RAAF aircrew d[MASK]ring the Berlin Airlift in 1948 [MASK] 49 and the deployment of No. 78 Wing RAAF to Malta i[MASK] the Mediterranean from 1952 to 1954 . Meanwhi[MASK]e , defence prep[MASK]r[MASK]dness initiatives included the introduction[MASK]of a National Service Scheme in 1951 to provide manpower for the citizen forces of the [MASK]rmy , RAAF[MASK]and RAN .

 On 25 Ju[MASK]e 1950 , the North Korean Army ( KPA ) crossed the border into South Korea and[MASK]advanced for the capital Seoul , which fell in less than a we[MASK]k . North Korean forces continued toward the port of Pusan and two days later the United States offered its assistance to South Korea . In response the Unit[MASK]d [MASK]ations Security Council requested members to assist in repelling the North Korean attack . Australia initially contr[MASK]bute[MASK] P @-@ 51 Mustang fighter @-@ bomber aircraft fro[MASK] No. 77 Squadron RAAF and infantry from the[MASK]3rd Battalion[MASK], Royal Australian Regiment ( 3 RAR ) , both of which were stationed in Japan as part of the BCOF . In addition , it provided the majority of supply and support personnel to the British Commonwealth Forces Korea . The RAN frigate HMAS Shoalhaven , and the destroyer HMA[MASK] Bataan , were also committed . Later , an aircraft carrier strike group aboard HMAS Sydney was added[MASK]to the force . 
 By the[MASK]time 3 RAR arrived in Pusan on 28 September , the North [MASK]oreans were in retreat following the Inchon landings . As a par[MASK] of the invasion force under the UN Supreme Commander , General Douglas MacArthur , the bat[MASK]alion moved nor[MASK]h a[MASK]d was involved in [MASK]ts first major action at Battle of Yongju near Pyongyang on 22 [MASK]ctober , before advancing toward[MASK] the Yal[MASK] River . Further successful actions followed at Kujin on 25 – 26 October 1950 and at Chongju o[MASK] 29 October 1950 . North Korean casualties were heavy , while Australian losses included their com[MASK]anding officer , Lieutenant Colone[MASK] Charles[MASK]Green , who was wounded in the s[MASK]omach by a[MASK]tillery fire after t[MASK]e battle and succumbed to his wounds and died two days later on 1 November . Meanwhile , during the last weeks of October the Chinese had moved 18 divisions[MASK]of the Pe[MASK]ple 's Volunteer Army across the Yal[MASK] [MASK]iver to reinforce the remnants of the KPA . Undetected by US and South Korean[MASK]intelligence , the 13th Army Group crossed the border on 16 October and pen[MASK]trated up to 100 kilometres ( [MASK]2 mi ) into North Korea , an[MASK] were reinforced in early November by 12 divisions f[MASK]om the 9th Army Group ; in total 30 divisions composed of 380 @,@ 000 men . 3 RAR fought its first action against the Chinese a[MASK] Pakchon on 5 Novem[MASK]er . The fighting cost the battalion hea[MASK]ily and despite halting a Chinese divi[MASK]io[MASK] the new battalion commander was dis[MASK]issed in the wake . Following the Chinese intervention , the UN forces were defeated in successive battles and 3 RAR was forced to withdraw to t[MASK]e 38th parallel . 
[MASK]A series of battles[MASK]followed at Uijeongbu on 1 – 4 January 1951 , as the British and Australians occupied defensive positions in an attempt to sec[MASK]re the northern approaches to[MASK]the South Korean capital . Further fighting occurred at Chuam @-@ ni on 14 – 17 February 1951 following another Chinese advance , and later at Maehwa @-@ San between 7 – 12 March 1951 as the UN[MASK]resumed the offensive . Australian troops [MASK]ubsequently participated in two more major battles in 1951 , with the first taki[MASK]g place during fighting which later became known as the Battle of K[MASK]pyong . On 22 April , Chinese force[MASK] attacked the Kapyong valley and forced the South Korean defenders to withdraw . Australian and[MASK]Canadian troops were ordered to halt this Chinese advance . After a night of fighting the Australians recaptured their positions , at the [MASK]ost[MASK]of 32 men killed and 59 wounded . In July 1951 , the Australian battalion beca[MASK]e part of the combined Canadian , British , Australian , New Zealand , and Indian 1st [MASK]ommonwealth Division . The second maj[MASK]r battle took place du[MASK]ing Operation Co[MASK]mando and occurred after the Chinese attac[MASK]ed a [MASK]alient in a bend of th[MASK] Imjin River . The 1st Commonw[MASK]alth Division counter @-@ att[MASK]cked on 3 October , capturing a num[MASK]er of objectives including Hill 355 [MASK]nd Hill 317 during the Battle of Maryang San ;[MASK]after five days the Chines[MASK] retreated . [MASK][MASK]stralian casua[MASK]ties included 20 dead and 104 wounded . 
 The [MASK]elligerents then became locked in static trench warfare akin to the First World War , in which men lived in tunnels , redoubts , and sandbagged forts behind barbed wire defences . From 1951[MASK]until the end of the war , 3 RAR held tre[MASK]ches on the eastern side of the division 's positions in the hills northeast of the Imji[MASK] Rive[MASK] . Across from them[MASK][MASK]ere heavily fortified Chin[MASK]se positions . In March 1952 , Australia increased its ground commitment to two battalions , sending 1 RAR . This battalion remained in Korea fo[MASK] 12[MASK]months , before being repl[MASK]ced by 2 RAR [MASK]n April 1953[MASK]. The Australians fough[MASK] their last battle during 24 – 26 July 195[MASK] , [MASK]ith 2 RAR holding off a concerted Chinese attack along the [MASK]amichon [MASK]iver and inflicting significant casualties for the loss of five k[MASK]ll[MASK]d and 24 wounded .

 = = = Malayan Emergency , 1950 – 60 = = = 
 
 The Malayan Emergency was declared on 18 June 1948 , after three[MASK]est[MASK]te ma[MASK]agers were murdered by members of the Malayan Communist Party ( MCP ) . Australian involve[MASK]ent began in Ju[MASK]e 1950 , when in response to a British request , six Lincolns from No. 1[MASK]Squadron and a[MASK]flight of[MASK]Dakotas from No. 38 Squ[MASK]dron [MASK]rrived in Singapore to form part of the Britis[MASK] Commonwealth Far East Air Fo[MASK]ce ( FEAF ) . The Dakotas were subsequently used on cargo runs , troop movement , as well as paratroop and l[MASK]aflet dro[MASK]s , while the Lincoln bombers carried out b[MASK]mbing raids against the Communist Terrorist ( CT ) jungle bases . The RAAF were particularly successful , and in one such mission known as Operation Termite , five Lincoln bombers destroyed 181 communist camps , killed 13 communists and forced one into surren[MASK]er , in a joint operation with the RAF and ground troops . The Lincolns were withdrawn in 1958 , and were re[MASK]laced by Canberra bombers from No.[MASK]2 Squa[MASK]ron and CAC Sabres from No. 78 Wing . Based at RAAF Base Butterworth they also carrie[MASK] out a n[MASK]mber ground attack missions a[MASK]ainst the guerrillas . 
 Australian ground forces were deployed to Malaya i[MASK] October 1955 as part of the Far East Strategic Reserve . In January 1[MASK]56 , the first Australian ground forces were deployed on Malaysian peninsula , consisting of the 2nd B[MASK]ttalion , Royal Australian[MASK]Regiment ( 2 RAR ) . 2 RAR mainly participated in " mopping up " operations over the next 20 months , conducting extensive patrolling in and near the [MASK]T jungle bases , as part of 28th British Commonwealth Bri[MASK]ade . Contact with the ene[MASK]y was infrequent and results small , achieving relatively few kills . 2 RAR left Malaysia October 1957 to be replaced by 3 RAR . 3 RAR underwent six weeks of jungle training and began dr[MASK]ving MCP insurgents back into[MASK]the jungle of Perak and Kedah . The new battalion[MASK]extensi[MASK]ely patrolled and was involved in food denial operations a[MASK]d ambushes . Again contact was limit[MASK]d , a[MASK]though 3 RAR had more success than its predecessor . By late 1959 , operations against the MCP were in th[MASK]ir final phase , and most communists had been pushed back and across the Thailand border . 3 RAR left Malaysia October 1959 and wa[MASK] repl[MASK]ced by 1 RAR . Though patrolling the border 1 RAR did not [MASK]ake contact with the insurgents , an[MASK][MASK]in October 1960 it was replaced b[MASK] 2 RAR , which stayed in Malaysia[MASK]until August 1963 . The Malayan Emergency officially ended on 31 Ju[MASK]y 1960 . 
 Australia also provided artillery and engineer [MASK]upport , along with an air @-@[MASK]field construction squadron . The Royal Australian Navy also served in Malayan waters , firing on suspected communist[MASK]positio[MASK]s between 1956 and 1957 . The Emergenc[MASK] was the longest continued commitment i[MASK] Australian military history ; 7 @,@ 000 Australians served and 51 died in Ma[MASK]aya — although only 15 were [MASK]n operations — and an[MASK]t[MASK]er 27 w[MASK]re wounded . 
 
 = = = Military and Naval growth during the 1960s = = = 
 
 At the start of[MASK]the 1960s , Prime Minister Robe[MASK]t Menzies greatly expanded the Australian military so that it cou[MASK]d carry out the Government 's policy of " Forward Defence " in South East Asia . In 1964 , Menzies announced a large increase[MASK]in defence spendi[MASK]g . The strength of the Australian Army would be i[MASK]creas[MASK]d by [MASK]0 % [MASK]ver three years[MASK]fro[MASK] 22 @,@ 000 t[MASK] 33 @,@ 000 ; providing a full three @-@ brig[MASK]de division with [MASK]ine battalions . The RAAF and[MASK]RAN would al[MASK]o both be increase[MASK] by 25 % . In 1964 , conscription or National Service was re @-@ introduced [MASK]nder the Nationa[MASK] Service Act , for selected 20 @-@ year @-@ olds based on date of birth , for a period of two years ' continuous full @-@ time service ( the previous scheme having been suspended in 1959 ) . 
 In 1961 , [MASK]hre[MASK] Charles F. Adams @-@ class destroyers were purchased from the United Sta[MASK]es to replace the ageing Q @-@ class destroyers . Traditionally , the RAN had purchased designs based on those of the Royal Navy and the purchase of American destroyers was significant[MASK]. HMAS Perth and[MASK]HMAS Hobart joined the fleet in 1965 , followed by HMAS Brisbane in 1967 . Other [MASK]r[MASK]jects included the construction of six River @-@ class frigates , the conversion of the aircraft carrier [MASK]MAS Melbourne to an anti @-@ submarine role , the acquisition of ten Wess[MASK]x helicopters , and the purchase of six Oberon @-@ [MASK]lass submarines . 
 The RAAF took delivery of their firs[MASK] Mirage fighters in 1967 , eq[MASK]ipping No. 3 , No. 75 and No. 77 Squadrons with them . The service also rec[MASK]ived American F @-@ 111 strike aircraft ,[MASK]C @-@ 130 Hercule[MASK] [MASK]ransports , P @-@ 3 Orion maritime reconnaissance ai[MASK]craft a[MASK]d Italian Macchi trainers . 
 
 = = = Indonesia @-@ Malaysia Confrontation , 1962 – 66 = = [MASK] 
 
 The Indonesia @-@ Malaysia confrontation was fought from 1962 to 1966 betw[MASK]en th[MASK] British Commonwealth and Indone[MASK]ia over the creation of the Federation[MASK]of Malaysia , with the Common[MASK]ealth attempting to s[MASK]fegu[MASK]rd the security of the new state . The war remained limited , and was fought primarily on the island of Borneo , although a number of Indonesian seaborne and a[MASK]rborne incursions onto the Malay Penins[MASK]la did occur . As part[MASK]of Australia 's continuing milita[MASK]y commitment to the[MASK]securit[MASK] of Malaysia , army , naval and airforce units were based there as [MASK]art of the Far E[MASK]st Strategic Reserve . Regardless the [MASK]ustralian government was wary of[MASK]i[MASK]volvement in a [MASK]ar[MASK]with Indonesia and initially limited its involvement to t[MASK]e defence of the Malayan peninsula only . On two occasions Austral[MASK]an troops from 3 RAR wer[MASK] used to help mop up infiltrators [MASK][MASK]om seaborne and airborne incursions at Labis and Pontian , in September and October 1964 . 
 Following these raids the go[MASK]ernment conceded to Britis[MASK] and Malaysian requests to deploy an infantry[MASK]battalion to Borneo . During the early phases , British and Mal[MASK]ysian troops[MASK]had attempted only to control the Malaysian / Indonesian border , and to protect popula[MASK]ion centres . However , by t[MASK]e time the Austra[MASK]ian battalion deployed the British had decided on more aggressive action , crossing the border into Kalimantan to obtain information and conduct ambushes to force the Indo[MASK]esians to remain on the defensive , under the codename Operation Claret . The fighting took place in mountainous , jungle @-@ clad terrain , and a debilit[MASK]ting climate[MASK], with operations characterised by the extensive use of company bases sited along the border , cros[MASK] @-@ border operations , the use of helicopters for troop movement a[MASK]d re[MASK]upply , and the role of human and signals intelligenc[MASK] to determine [MASK]ne[MASK]y movements and intentions . 
 3 RAR deployed to Borneo in March 1965 , a[MASK]d served in Sarawak until the end of July , operating on both sides of the border . The battalion had four major contacts with Indonesian forces and sever[MASK]l smaller ones — including at Sungei Koemba , Kindau and Babang during which they inflicted heavy casualties on the Indonesians — as well as suffering casualties in two mine incidents . 4 RAR served a less @-@ eventful tour [MASK]etween April and August 1966 , and also opera[MASK]ed over the border , successfully clashing with the Indonesian[MASK] on a number of occasions . A squadron of t[MASK]e Special Air Service Regiment ( SASR ) was[MASK]a[MASK]so deployed in 19[MASK]5 and again in 1966 , taking part in cross @-@ border operations and inflicting significant casualti[MASK]s on the Indonesians , even though they were often tasked with [MASK]overt reconnaissance . Ot[MASK]er units included artillery and engineers , while a number of [MASK]AN shi[MASK]s were involved in shelli[MASK]g I[MASK]donesian positio[MASK]s in Borneo and in repellin[MASK] infiltrators in th[MASK] Singapore Strait . The RAAF played a relatively minor role , although it would have been used far m[MASK]re extensively had the war escalated . 
 Ope[MASK]ations in Borneo were extremely se[MASK]sitive and they received little press coverage in [MASK]ustralia , while official acknowledgement of inv[MASK]lvement in cross @-@ border missions only occurred in 1996 . Following a military coup in Indonesia in early 1966 which brought General Suhart[MASK] t[MASK] powe[MASK] , a peace treaty was signed in August 1966 which ended the conflict . 3 @,@[MASK]500 Australians served during Confrontation ; casualties included 16 [MASK]ead , with seven killed in action and eight wounded . 
 
 = = = Vietnam War [MASK] 1962 – 73 = = = 
 
 Australia 's involvement in the Vietnam War was driven largely by the rise of communism in Southeast Asia after the Secon[MASK] Worl[MASK] War , and the fear of its spread which developed in Australia d[MASK]ring the 1950s and early 1960s . As a [MASK]onsequence , Australia [MASK]upported South Vietnam throughout the ear[MASK]y 1960s . In 1961 and 1962 , [MASK]he leader of the South Vietnamese government ,[MASK]Ngo Di[MASK]h Diem , asked for assistance from the US and its allies in response to a[MASK]growing insurgency supported by communist [MASK]orth Vietnam . Australia offered 30 military advisors from [MASK]he Australian Army T[MASK]ain[MASK]ng Team Vietnam , which became known simply as " The Team " . They arrived in July and August 1962 , beginning Australia 's involvement in the war . Later in August 1964 , the RAAF sent a flight of Caribou transport aircraft to the port city of Vung Tau . 
 However , with the security situation in South Vietnam continuing to deteriorate , the US increas[MASK]d its involvement to 200 @,@ 000 combat troops by early 1965 [MASK] Australia also committed ground forces , dis[MASK]atching the 1 RAR to serve with the US 173rd Airborne[MASK]Brigade in Bien Hoa province in June 1965 and it subsequently fought a number of significant actions , including Gang Toi , Operation Crimp and Suo[MASK] Bong Trang . In M[MASK]rch 1966[MASK], the Austral[MASK]an government announced the deployment of a [MASK]rigade @-@ s[MASK]zed unit — the 1st Australian Task Force ( 1 ATF ) — to replace 1 RAR . Included were a large number of conscripts , under the increasingly controversial National Service Scheme . Consisting of two infantry battalions a[MASK][MASK]well as armour ,[MASK]aviation , artillery and other support arms , th[MASK] task force was assigned primary responsibility for its own area and was bas[MASK]d at Nui Dat , in Phuoc Tuy Province . Included were the Iroquois helicopters of No. 9 Squadron RAAF . At the Battle of Long Tan on 18 August 1966 , D Company , 6[MASK]RAR with considerable artillery support held off and defeated a Viet Cong force that was a[MASK] least six times bigger than itself . 18 Aus[MASK]ralians were killed and 24 wounded , while 245 communist dead were later recovered from the battlefie[MASK]d . The battle allowed the Aus[MASK]ralians to gain dominance over Phuoc Tuy Province and 1 ATF was not fundamentally challenged again . Regardless , during February 1967 the Australians suffered their heaviest casualties[MASK]in the war t[MASK] that point , losing 16 men killed and 55 wounded in a single week , th[MASK] bulk during[MASK]Operation Bribie . 
 Yet with the Phuoc Tuy province coming progressively und[MASK]r control throughout 1967 , the Australians increasingly spent a significant period of time condu[MASK]ting[MASK]operations further afield . 1 ATF was subsequently deployed astride infiltration routes leading to Saigon to interdict communist movement against the capital as part of Operation Coburg during the 1968 [MASK]et Offensive and later during the Battle of Coral – Balmoral in May and June 1968 . At Fire Support Bases Coral and Ba[MASK]mora[MASK] the A[MASK]st[MASK]alians had clashed with regular North Vietnamese Army and V[MASK]et Cong main force units [MASK]perating in battalion an[MASK] regimental stre[MASK]gth for the first time in near conven[MASK]ional warfare , ultimately fighting their largest , most hazardous and most sustained batt[MASK]e of the war . During 26 days[MASK]of fighting Australian casualties included 25 killed and 99 wounded , while communist casualties incl[MASK]ded 267 killed confirmed by body c[MASK]unt , 60 possibly killed , 7 wounded and 11 captured . Other significant Australian actions included Binh Ba in June 1969 , Hat Dich in late @-@ December 19[MASK]8 and early 1969 and Long Khanh in June 1971 . At the height of the Australian commitment , 1 ATF numbered 8 @,@ 500 troops , including three i[MASK]fa[MASK]try battalions ,[MASK]armour , artillery , engineer[MASK] , logist[MASK]cs and aviation units in support[MASK].[MASK]A third RAAF unit , No. 2 Squadron RAAF , flying Canberra bo[MASK]bers , was sent in 1967 , and four RAN destroyers joined US patrols [MASK]n the wat[MASK]rs off North Vietnam . 
 The Australian withdrawal effec[MASK]ively commenced in November 1970 . As a conseque[MASK]ce of the overall allied strategy of Vietnamiz[MASK]tion and with the Australian government keen to[MASK]reduce its own commitment to the war , 8 RAR was not replaced at the[MASK]end o[MASK] its tour of duty . 1 ATF was again reduced to just two infantr[MASK] battalions[MASK], albeit with significant armour , artillery and aviation support rema[MASK]ning . Australian combat forces[MASK]were fu[MASK]ther reduced during 1971 as part of a phased withdrawal , and 1 ATF ceased opera[MASK]ions in October . Mea[MASK]while , the advisors remained to train South Vietnamese troops until withdrawn on 18 [MASK]ecember 1972 by the newly elected L[MASK]bor government of Gough Whitlam . The last Australian forces were finally withdrawn in 1973 . The Vietnam War was Australia '[MASK] longest and[MASK]most controversial war and although initially enjoying broad support , as the nation 's military involvement increased a[MASK]vocal anti @-@ war movement developed . More than 50 @,@ 000 Australians served in Vietnam ; 519 wer[MASK] killed and 2 @,@ 398 were wounded . Four were awarded[MASK]the Victoria Cross .

 Although the importance of ' joint ' warfare had been highlighted during Second World War when Australian naval , ground and air units frequently served as part of single commands , the absence of a central authority continued to result in poor co @-@ ordination[MASK]between the services in the p[MASK]st @-@ war era , with each organising and operating on [MASK]he basis of a different military doctrine . The need for an integrated command [MASK]tructure received more emphasis during the Aust[MASK]alian military 's ex[MASK]eriences in the Vietnam War . In 1973 , the Secretary of the Department of Defence , Arthur Tange , subm[MASK]tted a report to the Governm[MASK]nt that recommended the unification of the separate departmen[MASK]s supporting each service into a single departme[MASK]t and the crea[MASK]ion of the post of Chi[MASK]f of the Defence Force Staff . 
 The Whitlam La[MASK]or Government subsequently amalgamated the five defence ministries ( Defence , Navy , Army , Air Force , and Supply ) into a s[MASK]ngle Department of Defence i[MASK] 1973 , while conscription under the National Service scheme was abo[MASK]ished . On 1 January 197[MASK][MASK], the three branches of the Australian military wer[MASK] brought tog[MASK]ther as a unified , all @-@ vol[MASK]nteer , professional force known as the Australian Defence Force ( ADF ) . T[MASK]day , the ADF is headquartered at Russell Offices in Canberra and is divided into Air , Land , Maritime and S[MASK]ecial Opera[MASK]ions [MASK]o[MASK]mands .

 = = = Defence of Australia , 1980s and 1[MASK]90s = = = 
[MASK]
 Until the 1970s , Australi[MASK] 's military strategy centred on the concept of Forward Defence , in which the role of Australian military and naval forces were to co @-@ operate with Allied force[MASK] to cou[MASK]ter threats in Australia 's region . Following the adoption of the Guam Doctrine by the Un[MASK]ted States in 1969 , and the British withdrawal ' east of Suez ' in the early 1970s , Australia developed a defence polic[MASK] emphasising self @-@ reliance and the defence of the Austral[MASK]an continent . Known as the Defence of Australia Policy , it focused Australian defence planning on protecting the nation 's northern maritime approaches ( the ' air @-@ sea gap ' ) against possible attack . 
 In line with this goal , the ADF was restructured to increase its ability to strike at enemy forces from [MASK]u[MASK]tralian bases[MASK]and to counter raids on continental Australia . This was achieved by increasing the capabilities of the RAN and RAAF ,[MASK]and relocating regular Army units to Northe[MASK]n Australia . During this time the ADF had no military units on operational deployment outside Australia . However , in 1987 the ADF made its first operational deployment as part of Operation Morris Dance , in which several warships and a rifle company deployed to the waters [MASK]ff Fiji in response to the 1987 Fiji[MASK]n coups d 'état . While broadly successful , this deployment highlighted the need for[MASK]the ADF to improve its capability to [MASK]apid[MASK]y respond to unforese[MASK]n[MASK]events .[MASK]
 During this period Australia conti[MASK]ued to retain forces in Malaysia as part of the Five Power Defence Arran[MASK]ements ( FPDA ) agreed in 1971 to defend it in the event of external attack , with this commitment initi[MASK]lly inclu[MASK]ing significant air , ground and naval forces . However , these forces were gradually reduced with the infantry battalion withdrawn from Singapor[MASK] in 1973 , and the two Mirage fighter squadrons in 1988 . Sin[MASK]e then a detachment of Orion maritime patrol a[MASK]rcraft , sup[MASK]ort per[MASK]onnel , and an infantry company known as Rifle Company Butterworth have been ma[MASK]ntained , as well[MASK]as occasional deploymen[MASK]s of F / A @-@ 18 Hornet fighter aircraft . Australian submarines w[MASK]re reportedly also involved[MASK]in a number of[MASK]cl[MASK]ndestine surveillan[MASK]e missions throughout Asian waters in t[MASK]e [MASK]ast decades of the Cold War [MASK] Airforce a[MASK]d Navy units were also involved in tracking Soviet ship and submarine movements in the region . Since then the Orions have continued to participate[MASK]in maritime[MASK]security operations as part of Operation Gateway , conducting patrols over the Indian Ocean [MASK] Strait of Malacca and Sout[MASK] China Sea . They have reportedly also been involved[MASK]in freedom of navigation fl[MASK]ghts .

 Australia was a member of the internationa[MASK] coalition wh[MASK]ch [MASK]ontribut[MASK]d military forces to the 1991 Gulf War , deploying a na[MASK]al task group of two wa[MASK]ship[MASK] , a support shi[MASK] and [MASK] cl[MASK]arance diving team ; in total about 750 personnel[MASK]. The Australian contribut[MASK]on was the first time Australian personnel were[MASK]deployed to an active war zone since the establ[MASK]shment of the ADF and the deployment tested its capabilities and command structure . However , the Australian force did[MASK]not see combat , and instead playing a significant role in enforcing the sanctions put in place against[MASK]I[MASK]aq following the invasion of Kuwait . Some ADF personnel servin[MASK] on exch[MASK]n[MASK]e with Briti[MASK]h and American units did see combat , and a few were later decorated for their actions . Following the wa[MASK] , the Navy regularly deployed a fri[MASK]at[MASK] to the Persian Gulf or Red Sea to enforce the trade [MASK]anctions which continued to be applied to Iraq .

 = = = Global security , late @-@ 1990s = = = [MASK] 
 Since the [MASK]ate 1980s , the Australian government had increasingly called upon the ADF to contribute forces to peacekeeping missions around the w[MASK]rld . While most of these d[MASK]ployments involved only small numbers of specialists , several led to the deployment of hundreds of personnel . Large peacekeeping deployments were made to Namibia in early 1989 , Cambodia between 1992 and 1993 , Somalia in 1993 , Rwanda between 1994 and 1995 an[MASK] Boug[MASK]inv[MASK]lle in 1994 and from 1997 onwards . The 1996 election of the Howard L[MASK]beral government resulted in significant reforms to the ADF 's force structure and role , with the ne[MASK] government 's defence strategy plac[MASK]d less singular emphasis on defending Australia from direct attack and greater emphas[MASK]s on w[MASK]rking in co @-@ operation with regional states and Australia 's allies to manage potential security threats in recognition of Australia 's global security interests . In line with this new focus , the ADF 's force structure changed[MASK]in an attempt to increase the proportion of combat units to support units and to improve the ADF 's combat effectiveness .

However , following the announcement of the results pro[MASK]@-@ Indonesian militias supported by elements [MASK]f the Indonesian milit[MASK]ry , launched a campaign of violence , looting and arson and many East Timorese were killed , w[MASK]ile perhaps more than 500 @,@ 000 were displaced [MASK] Una[MASK]le to control the violence [MASK] Indonesia subsequently agreed to the deployment of a multinatio[MASK]al peacekeeping force . Australia , which had contributed police to UNAMET , organised and le[MASK] an international military coalition , known as the International Force for East Timor ( INTERFET ) , a non @-@ UN force operating i[MASK] accordance[MASK]with UN resolutions . The total size of the Australian force committed numbered 5 @,@ 500 personnel , and included a significant ground force , supported by air and naval forces[MASK], in the largest single deploym[MASK]nt of[MASK]Australian f[MASK]rces since 1945 . 
 Under the overall c[MASK]mmand of Australian Major General [MASK]eter Cosgrove , INTERFET began arriving on 12 September[MASK]1999 and was tasked with rest[MASK]ring peace and security , protecting [MASK]nd suppor[MASK]ing UNAMET , and facilitating humanitarian assistance operations . With[MASK]the with[MASK]rawal of the Indonesian armed forces , police and government officials from East Timor , UNAMET re @-@ establish[MASK]d its headquarters in Dili on 28 Sep[MASK]ember . On 19 October 1999 , Indonesia formally recognised the result of the refer[MASK]ndum and shortly there[MASK]fter a UN pe[MASK]cekeeping force , the United Nations [MASK]ransitional Ad[MASK]inistration in East Timor ( UNTAET ) was established , becoming fully respon[MASK]ible for the administration of East Timor during its transition to independence . The han[MASK] @-@ ov[MASK]r of command of military operations from INTERFET to UNTAET w[MASK]s completed on 28 February 2000 . Australia continued to support the UN peacekeeping operation with between 1 @,@ 500 and 2 @,@ 000 personnel , as well as landi[MASK]g craft and Blackhawk helicopters and remained the [MASK]argest contributor of personnel to the peacekeeping missi[MASK]n . During the[MASK]e operations Australian forces regularly clashed with pro @-@ Ind[MASK]nesian militia and on a number of occasions Indonesian forces as well , [MASK]specially along the border with West Timor . Significant actions occurred in Suai , Mota 'ain and at Aidabasalala in October 1999[MASK]. However , with the security situation stabilised the b[MASK]lk of the Australian and UN forces were withdrawn by 2005 . Two Australians died from non @-@ battle related c[MASK]uses , while a nu[MASK]ber were wounded in action . 
 The unexpected deployment to East Timor in 1999 led to significant changes in Austr[MASK]lian defence policy and to an enhancement of the ADF '[MASK] ability to conduct operati[MASK]ns outside Australia . This successful deployment was the first time a l[MASK]rge Australian military force had operated outside of[MASK]Australia since the Vietnam War and revealed shortcomings in the ADF 's ability to mount and sustain such operations . In response , the 2000 Defence White Paper placed a greater emphasis on preparing the [MASK]DF for overseas deplo[MASK]ments . The Australian go[MASK]ernment committed to improve the ADF 's capabilities by[MASK]improving the readiness and equipment of ADF units , ex[MASK]anding the ADF to 57 @,@ 000 full @-@ time personnel and increasing real Defence expendit[MASK]re by 3 % per year . 
 In May 2006 , 2 @,@ 000 ADF personnel[MASK]were again deployed to East Timor as part of Opera[MASK][MASK]on Astute , following unrest between e[MASK]e[MASK]ents of the Timor Leste Def[MASK]nce Force . Austr[MASK]lian forces were involved in a number skirmishes during this tim[MASK] , including a heavy clash with rebels [MASK]ommanded by Alfredo Re[MASK]nado at Same on 4 March 2007 . However , by early @-@ 2010 the s[MASK]curity sit[MASK][MASK]tion had been stabilised and just 400 Australian personnel remained to train the local security forces as part of a small international force . Following a drawdown , the International Stabilisation Force commenced withdrawing from Timor @-@ [MASK]este in November 2012 , a process which was[MASK]completed in April 2013 .

 Shortly after the Islamist inspired terrorist attacks in New York and Washington on 11 September 2001 , Australian forces were c[MASK]mmitted to the American @-@[MASK]led international coalition against terrorism . The ADF 's most visible contribution —[MASK]codenamed Operation Slipper — has been a special forces task group operating i[MASK] Afghanistan from 2001 to 200[MASK] [MASK]nd again from mid @-[MASK] 2005 to fight against the Taliban . Over time the Australian commitment has grown ,[MASK]with the addition of further ground forces in the fo[MASK]m of a Reconstruction Task Force from 2006 to [MASK]rovide security , reconstruction and to mentor and train the Afghan N[MASK]tional Army . Australia has also contributed a frigate[MASK]and two AP @-@ 3C [MASK]rion sur[MASK]eilla[MASK][MASK]e aircraft and three C @-@ 1[MASK]0 Hercules transport aircraft to international operations in the Persian Gulf and Indian Ocean since 2001 , supporting both the operations in[MASK]Af[MASK]hanistan a[MASK]d th[MASK]se in Iraq under Oper[MASK]tion Catalyst . A detachment of four F / A @-@ 18 Hornet fighter @-@ bombers was based at Diego Garcia from la[MASK]e @[MASK]@ 2001 to mid @-@ 2002 , while two Boein[MASK] 707 air @-@ to @-@ air refuelling aircraft were also based in Manas[MASK]A[MASK]r Bas[MASK] in Kyrgyzstan t[MASK] provide support to coali[MASK]ion aircraft operating in Afghan[MASK]airspace but were later withdrawn . A Special Operations Task Group was deployed to support the Reconstruction Taskforce in April 2007 . In addition to radar crews , logistics and intelligence officers , and security personnel , this brought the number of Australian personnel in Afgha[MASK]istan to 950 by mid @-@ 2007 , with further small increases to 1 @,@ 000 in mid @-@ 20[MASK]8 , 1 @,@ 100 in early 2009 and 1 @,@ 550 in mid @-@ 2009 . 
 A modest[MASK]force remained in Afghanistan over this time and was involved in counter @-@ insurgency operations in Uru[MASK]gan Province in conjunction United States and other coalition for[MASK]es , including the Dutch prior to their withdrawal . The[MASK]force consisted[MASK]of motorised infantry , special for[MASK]es , engineers , cavalry , artillery and aviation elements . By 2010 it included a combined arm[MASK] battalion @-@ sized battle group known as the Mentorin[MASK] Task Force , and the Special Operations Task Group [MASK] both based at Forward Operation Base Ripley outside of Tarin Kowt , as well as the Rotary Wing Group[MASK]flying CH @-@ 47D Chinooks [MASK] the Force Logistics Asset and an RAAF air surveillance radar unit based in Kandahar . In addition , a further 800 Australian logistic[MASK]personnel w[MASK]re also based in the Middle East in support , but are located outside of Afghanistan . Meanwhile , detachments of maritime patrol and transport aircraft continued to support operations in Iraq and [MASK]fghanistan , based out of Al Minhad Air Base in the United Arab Emirates . Also included is the deployment of one of the RAN 's frigates t[MASK] the Arabian [MASK]ea and Gulf of Aden on co[MASK]nter piracy and maritime interdiction duties . 
 [MASK]ustr[MASK]lian forces were at times involved in heavy fighting , and significant actions included Operation Anaconda in 2[MASK]02 and Operation Perth in[MASK]2006 , as well as actions [MASK]n Chora in 2007 , Kakarak in 2009 , the Shah Wali Kot and Derapet in 2010 , and Doan in 2011 ; although others have yet to be publicly acknowledged due to operational security requirements . Casualties include 41 killed and 256 wounded , while another Australian also died serving with the British Army . Four Australians have been awarded the Victoria Cross for Australia , the first such decorations in forty years . Following a drawdown in forces , the last combat troops were withdrawn on 15 Decem[MASK]er 2013 ; however , approximately 400 personnel remain in Afghanistan as trainers and[MASK]advisers[MASK], and are stati[MASK]ned in Kandahar and Kabul [MASK] Over 2[MASK] @,@ 0[MASK]0 Australian pe[MASK]sonnel have served in Afghanistan .

 Australian forces later joined British and American fo[MASK]ces during the 2003 invasion of Iraq . The init[MASK]al contribution was also a modest one , consis[MASK]ing of just 2 @,@ 058 personnel — co[MASK]enamed Operation Falconer . Major force elements included special forces , rotary and fixed wing aviation and nav[MASK]l units . Army units in[MASK]luded elements from the SASR and 4th[MASK]Battalion , Royal Australian Regiment ( Commando[MASK]) , a CH @-@ 47 Chinook detachment and a [MASK]umber of othe[MASK] specialist [MASK]nits . RAN units included the amphibious sh[MASK]p HMAS Kanimbla and the frigates HMAS Darwin and HMAS Anzac , while the RAAF deployed 14 F / A @-@ 18 Hornets from No. 75 Squadron , a number o[MASK] AP @-@ 3C Orions and C @-@ 130 Hercules . [MASK]he Australian Special Forces Task Force was one[MASK]of the first coalition units forces to cross the border into [MASK]raq , while for a few days , the closest ground troops to Baghdad were from the SASR . During the inva[MASK]ion the RAAF also flew its first combat missions since the Vietnam War , with No. 75 Squadron flying a to[MASK]al of 350 sorties and dropping 122 laser @-@ gu[MASK]ded bombs . 
 The Iraqi military quickly proved no match for coalitio[MASK] military power , and with their defeat the bulk of Australian forces were withdrawn . While[MASK]Australia did not initially take part in the post[MASK]@-@ war occupation of Iraq , an Australian Army light armoured battlegroup — designated th[MASK] Al Muthanna Task Group[MASK]and including 40 ASLAV light armoured vehicles and infantry — was later deployed to Southern Iraq in[MASK]April 2[MASK][MASK]5 as part of Oper[MASK]tion Catalyst . The role of this force was to protect the Japanese engineer contingen[MASK] in the region and [MASK]upport the training of New Iraqi Army units . The AMTG later became the Overwatch Battle Group ( West ) ( OBG ( W ) ) , following the hand back of Al Muthanna pr[MASK]vince to Iraqi control[MASK]. Force levels [MASK]ea[MASK]ed[MASK]at 1 @,@ 400 personnel in May 2007 including the OBG ( W ) in Southern [MASK]raq , the Security Detachment in Bagh[MASK]ad and the Australian Army Training Team — Iraq [MASK] A RAN frigat[MASK] was based in the North Persian Gulf , while RAA[MASK] assets included C[MASK]@-@ 130H Hercules and AP @-@ 3C elements . Following the election of a new Labor government under Prime Minister Kevin Rudd the bulk of these forces were withdrawn by mid @-@ 2009 , while RAAF and[MASK]RAN operations were redirected to other parts [MASK]f the Middle East Area of[MASK]Operati[MASK]ns as part of Operation Slipper . 
 Low @-@ level operations continued , however , with a small Australian force of 80 soldiers remai[MASK]ing in Iraq to protect the Australian Em[MASK]assy in Baghdad as part of SEC[MASK]ET under Operation Kruger . SECDET was finally withd[MASK]awn in A[MASK]gust 2011 , and was replaced by a p[MASK]ivate militar[MASK] company which took over responsibility for providing security for Australia 's diplomatic presence [MASK]n Iraq [MASK] Although mo[MASK]e than 17 @,@ 000 personnel ser[MASK]ed during operations[MASK]in Iraq[MASK], Australian casualties were relatively light , with two s[MASK]ldiers accidentally killed , while[MASK]a thi[MASK]d Austral[MASK]an died serving with the British Royal Air Force . A further [MASK]7 personnel were[MASK]wounded . Two officers remained in Iraq attached to the United Nations Assistance Mission for Iraq as part of Operation Rive[MASK]bank .

 In June 2014 [MASK] small number of[MASK]SASR personnel were deployed[MASK]to Iraq to protect[MASK]the Australian embassy when the security of Baghdad was thre[MASK][MASK]ened by the 2014 Northern Iraq offensive[MASK]. Later , in August and September a number[MASK]of RAAF C @-@ 17 and C @-@ 130J[MASK]transport aircraft based in the Middle East were used to c[MASK]nduct aird[MASK]o[MASK]s of humanitarian aid to trapped civilians and to airlift arms and munitions to forces in Kurdish @-@ controlled northern Iraq . In late September 2014 an Air Task Group ( ATG ) and Special Operations Task Group ( SOTG[MASK]) were deployed to Al Minhad Air Base in the United Arab Emirates as part of the coal[MASK]tion to combat Islamic State forces in Iraq .

 = Ward Churchill = 
 
 Ward LeRoy Chur[MASK]hill ( born 1947 ) is a[MASK] American author and political activist . He was a pro[MASK]essor of ethnic studies at the University of Colorado Boulder from 1990 until 2007 . The primary focus of his work is on the historical treatment of political dissenters and Native Americans by the U[MASK]ited States governmen[MASK] . His work features controv[MASK]rsial and provoc[MASK]tive views , written in a direct , often confrontational styl[MASK] . 
 In January 2005[MASK], Churchill 's work attracted controversy because of the[MASK]circulation of a 2001 essay , " On the[MASK]Justice of Roosting Chickens " , in [MASK]hich he argued the September 11 attacks were a natural and unavoidable consequen[MASK]e of unlawfu[MASK] US foreign policy over the latter half of the 20th century ; the essay is well known for Churchill 's use of the ph[MASK]ase " little Eichmanns " to describe the " technocratic corps " working in the World Trade Center . 
 In March 2005 the University of Colorado bega[MASK] investigating allegations that Churchill had engaged in rese[MASK]rch misconduct ; it report[MASK]d in June 2006 [MASK]hat he had done so . Churchill was fired on July 24 , 2007 , leading to a claim by some scholars that he was fired because of the " Little Eichmanns " comment . Churchill filed a lawsuit against the University of Colorado for un[MASK]awful termination of employment . In April 2009 a[MASK]Denver jury f[MASK]und that C[MASK]urchill was wrongly fired , awarding him $ 1 in[MASK]damages . In July 2009 , a[MASK]District Cou[MASK]t judge vacated the monetary award and declined Churchill 's request to order his reinstatement , decidin[MASK] the u[MASK]iversity has " quasi @-@ judicial immunity " . In February 2010 , Churchill appealed the judge 's [MASK]ecision . In November 2010 , the C[MASK]lorad[MASK] Court of Appeals upheld the lower @-@ court 's ruling . In September 10 , 2012 , the Colorado [MASK]upreme Court uphel[MASK] the lower courts[MASK]' decisi[MASK]ns in favor of the University of Colora[MASK]o . On [MASK]pril 1[MASK], 2013 , the United States Supreme Court declined to hear the case . 
 In a February 2014 interview , Churchill commented that after living more than forty years in the n[MASK]rthern plains / Colorado region , he had relocated to Atlanta , Georgia in 2013 . Churchill also stated that he had a[MASK]half @-@ dozen uncompleted books which he intended to finish[MASK]and publish in the next three years . 
 
 = = Ea[MASK]ly life and education = = 
 
 Churchill was born in U[MASK]bana , Illinois , to Jack LeRo[MASK] Churchill and Maralyn Lucretia Allen . His parents divorced before he was two , and he grew up in Elmwood , where he attended local schools . 
 In 1966 , he was drafted into the United States[MASK]Army . On his [MASK]980 resume [MASK] he said he served as a public [MASK]-@ information specialist who " wrote and edited the battalion newsletter and wrote news releases . " 
 In a 1987 profile on Churchill , the Denver Post reported th[MASK]t he w[MASK]s drafted , went to paratrooper school ,[MASK]then[MASK]volunteer[MASK]d for Viet[MASK]am , where he served a 10 @-@ month tour as Long Range Reconnaissance Patrol ( [MASK]RRP ) , one of a six @-@ man team sent out to track down the enemy . The Post article[MASK]also reported that Chur[MASK]hill was politically radicalized[MASK]as a result of his experienc[MASK]s in Vietnam . Churchill told the Post that he had spent some time at the Chicago off[MASK]ce of the Students for a Democratic Society ( SDS ) in the late 1960s , and briefly taught members of the Weather Undergr[MASK]und how to build bombs and fire weapons . 
 In 2005 , the Denver Post reported that Churchill 's military records show he was t[MASK]ained as a film projection[MASK]st and light truck driver , but they do not reflect par[MASK]trooper school or LRRP training . The 75th Ranger Regiment Association found no record of Churchill having been a member of the unit , or a LRRP team . 
 Churchill received his B.A. in technological communications in 1974[MASK]and M.A. in communications theory in 1975 , bo[MASK]h from[MASK]Sangamon State University , now[MASK]th[MASK] University of Illinois a[MASK] Springfield . 
 
 = = Career = = 
 
 In 1978 , Churchill began working at the University of Colorado Bould[MASK]r as an affirmati[MASK]e action officer in the university admini[MASK]tration . He also lectured on American Indian issu[MASK]s in the ethnic studies program . In 1990 , the University of Colorado hired him as an associate profes[MASK]or , although he did not possess the academic doctorate usually required for[MASK]the position . The following year he was granted tenure in the Communications department , without the usual six @-@ year probationary period , after having been declined by the Sociology and Political Science departments . 
 He has lon[MASK] been interested in issues associated with the Dawes Act , which broke up the communal reservation lands and assigned plots to indi[MASK]idual households [MASK] Connected with that was the federal government 's f[MASK]rst use of " blood quantum " to define individual membership in trib[MASK]s , for what became known as the Dawes Rolls . Since re @-@ establishing self @-@ governments , fed[MASK]rally recognized tribes have established their own criteria for enrollment as members , o[MASK]ten related t[MASK] descent[MASK]from recognized historical lists , but less[MASK]often re[MASK]uiring proofs of blood quantum . So[MASK]e of his published works address these iss[MASK]es , which he has interprete[MASK] as part of the feder[MASK]l government 's poli[MASK]y of genocide against N[MASK]tive Americans .[MASK]
 In 1995 Churchill discussed his views with David Barsamian in an [MASK]nterview :[MASK]
 [MASK]ou could say that five hundred years ago was the basis of blood quantum in[MASK]Ibero @-@ America . But in Anglo @-@ America , while there was some preoc[MASK]upation with it , it was not formalized until the passage of the General Allotment A[MASK]t , m[MASK]d @-@ 1880s . At that [MASK]oint they began to define In[MASK]ian as being someone who was demonstrably and doc[MASK]mentably of at lea[MASK]t one @-@ quarter by quantum bloo[MASK] [MASK]ndigenous in a given group . You couldn 't be an eighth Cheyenne and an eighth Arapaho and be an Indian . You had to be a quarter Cheyenne or a quarter Arapaho or hopefully a quarter and a quarter . The reason for this was quite[MASK]clear [MASK] They were identify[MASK]ng Indians for purposes of allotting them i[MASK]dividual p[MASK]rcels of land in the existing reservation base at that p[MASK]int . If they ran out of Indians identifiabl[MASK] as such , then the rest of[MASK]the la[MASK]d would be declared surplus . So it was clearly in the interests[MASK]of the government to cre[MASK]te a definition of Indianness that would minimiz[MASK] the number of Indians that were available . It wa[MASK] an economic motivation for the application of this genetic criter[MASK]a to Indianness in the first plac[MASK] . It 's become increas[MASK]ngly so ever since . " ( David Barsamian ( December 1995 ) . " Interview with Ward Churchill : Historical and Current Perspectives " . Z Magazine . ) 
 In 1996 , Churchill moved to the new Eth[MASK]ic Studies Department of the University of Colorado . In 1997 , he was promoted to full professor . He was selected as chairman of the department in June 2002 . 
 In January 2005 , during the controversy over his 9 / 11 remarks , Churchill resigned as c[MASK]airman of the ethnic studies depar[MASK][MASK]ent at the University of Colorado — his term as chair was schedu[MASK]e[MASK] t[MASK] expire in June of that year . On May 16 , 200[MASK] , the Investigative Committee of the Standin[MASK] Committee on Research Misconduct at the Uni[MASK]ersity of Colorado concluded that Churchill h[MASK]d committed mul[MASK]iple c[MASK]unts of academic misconduct , specifically plagiarism , fabrication , and falsi[MASK]ication . On July 24 , 2007 , Churchill was fired for academic misconduct in an eight to one vote by the University of Colorado 's Board of Regents .

 In 2003 , Churchill stated , " I am myself of Muscogee and Creek[MASK]descent on my father 's side , Cherokee on my mother 's , and am an enrolled member o[MASK] the United Keetoowah Band of[MASK]Cherokee Indians . " In 1992 , Churchill wrote elsewhere that he is one @-@ eighth Creek and one @-@ sixteenth Cherokee . I[MASK] 1993 , Chu[MASK]chill told the Colorado[MASK]Daily that " he was one @-@ sixteenth Creek and Cherokee . " Churchill told the Denver Post in February 2005 that he is three @-@ sixteenths Ch[MASK]rokee . 
 In a statem[MASK]nt dated May 9 , 20[MASK]5 , and posted on its we[MASK]site , the United Keetoowah Band initially[MASK]said , 
 " The United Keetoowah Band would like to make it clear that Mr. Churchill IS NOT a me[MASK]ber of the Keetoowah Band and was only given an honorar[MASK] ' associate membership ' in the early 1990s [MASK]ecause he could not prove any Cherokee ance[MASK]try . " The tribe s[MASK]id that all of Churchi[MASK]l 's [MASK] past , present[MASK]and[MASK]future claims or assertions of Keetoowah ' enrollm[MASK]nt , ' written or spoken , including but not limited to ; biographies , cur[MASK]iculum vitae , lectures , applica[MASK]ions for employme[MASK]t [MASK] or any other reference not listed herein , are deemed fraudulent by the United Keeto[MASK]wah Band . " 
 Two days later[MASK], t[MASK]e United Keetoowah Band replaced its statement and acknowledged Churchill 's " alleged ancestry [MASK] of being Cherokee : 
 " Because Mr. Churchill had genealogical information regarding his alleged ancestry , and his wi[MASK]lingness to assist the UKB in pro[MASK]oting the tribe an[MASK] its causes , he was awarded an ' Associate Membership [MASK] as an honor , " the tribe 's website now said . " Ho[MASK]ever , Mr. Churchill may possess eligibility status for Cherokee Nation of Oklahoma , since he claims 1 / 16 Cherokee . " 
 The tribe 's spokesperson , Lisa Stopp , stated the tribe enrolls only me[MASK]bers with certified one @-@ quarter American Indian blood . The website statement furthe[MASK] clar[MASK]fie[MASK] that Chu[MASK]chill " was no[MASK] eligible for tr[MASK]bal membership due to the fact that he does not possess a ' Certificate of Degree of Indian Blood ( CDIB ) " , and the associa[MASK]e membership did not entitle an individual to voting rights or enrollment in the tribe . 
[MASK]Churchill has never asked for CDIB certification , and finds the idea of [MASK]eing " vetted " by[MASK]the US government offensive . 
 In June 1994 , the United Keetoowah Ban[MASK] had voted to stop[MASK]award[MASK]ng associate memberships . Such honorary associa[MASK]e membership recognizes an individual 's assistance to the tribe , but it [MASK]as nothing to do[MASK]wit[MASK] Indian ancestry , an[MASK] it does not e[MASK]t[MASK]tle an individual to vote in the tribe as [MASK] member . The [MASK]eetoowah Band states that Churchill stil[MASK] holds the associate membership and it has not been rescinded . In a separate interview , Ernestine Berry , formerly on t[MASK]e tribe 's enrollment committee and four years [MASK]n its council , said that Churchill had never [MASK]ulfilled a promise to [MASK]elp the tribe . 
 In June 2005 , the Rocky Mountain News published an article about Churchill 's genealogy and family history . It " turn[MASK]d up no evidence of a singl[MASK] Indian a[MASK]cestor " among 142 direct ances[MASK]ors [ of Churchill 's ] identified from records . The News reported that both Churchill 's birth parents were listed as w[MASK]ite on the 1930 census [MASK] as were all but two of h[MASK]s great @-@ great @-@ [MASK]randparents listed on previous census and other official documents . The News found that some of Churchill 's accounts of where his ance[MASK]tors had lived did[MASK]not agree with documented records . Numerous member[MASK] of Churc[MASK]ill 's extended family have longstanding family leg[MASK]nds of Indian ancestry among ance[MASK]tors ; but , none [MASK]as confirmed among the 142 direct forebears of Churchill who w[MASK]re identif[MASK]ed[MASK]. 
 Docu[MASK]ents in Churchill 's university personnel [MASK]ile show [MASK]hat he was granted tenure in a " special opportunity position . " In 1994 , then CU @-@ Boulder Chancellor James Corbridge refused to take action on allegations [MASK]hat Churchill was fraudulently claim[MASK]ng to be an Indian , sayin[MASK] " it has alw[MASK]ys been university poli[MASK]y that a person 's race or ethnicity is self @-@ proving . " 
 Some of Churchi[MASK]l 's[MASK]Native Ameri[MASK]an critics , such as Vernon Bellecourt ( White Earth Oji[MASK]we ) and Suzan Shown Harjo ( Southern Cheyenne [MASK]-@ Muscogee C[MASK]eek ) , argue that his assertion of Native American ancestr[MASK] without[MASK]the ability to prove it might co[MASK]stitute misrepresentation and gro[MASK]nds for termination . The University has said that it does not hire on the basis of ethnicity . The Univ[MASK]rsity of Colorado 's Research Misconduct Committee conducted a preliminary investigation into whether Churchill misrepresented his ethnicity to " add credibility and publi[MASK] acceptance to his scholarship . " The committee concluded that the allegation was not " appropriate for further investigation under the definition of research misconduct . " 
 In a 2005 int[MASK]rview in The Rocky Mounta[MASK]n News , Churchill said , " I have never been confirmed as having one @-@ quarter blood , and never said I was . An[MASK] even if [ the critics [MASK] are absolutely right , w[MASK]at does that have to do with this issue ? I have never claimed to be goddamned Si[MASK]ting Bull . " The longtime indigenous activist Russell Means said in February of that year[MASK], " So I want [MASK] from this day forward , every media perso[MASK] nationally , internationally and locally to know that we have ascertained that Wa[MASK]d Churchill is a full @-@ blooded Indian l[MASK]ader . " 
 
 = = = Bloo[MASK] quantum = = = 
 
 Churchill has [MASK]esponded to requests[MASK]for verification of his claimed Indian heritage in various ways , including attacking the blood quantum upon which some Native Americ[MASK]n tribes establish their membership requirements . Churchill argues that the United States instituted bloo[MASK] quantum laws based upon rules of descendancy in order to further goals of personal enrichment and political expediency . 
 For decades in his writings , Churchill has argued that blood quantum laws ha[MASK]e an inherent genocidal purpose . He says , 
 " Set the blood quantum at one @-@ quarter , hold to it as a rigid definition of Indians , let intermarriage proceed as it [ has ] and eventually Indian[MASK] will be defined out of e[MASK]istence " . 
 Church[MASK]ll 's assertions have been raised as one of the several resear[MASK]h @-@ misconduct allegations that were brought against him in [MASK]005 ( see below ) . He has been accused of using his interp[MASK]etation of the Dawes Act to attack tribal governments that would not recognize him as a member .

 C[MASK]urchil[MASK] has written on American [MASK]ndian history and culture , and speaks about genocide inflicted on t[MASK]e indigenous people of[MASK]t[MASK]e Americas by European settlers and what he describes as the repression of native people[MASK] that continues to t[MASK]is day . 
 As [MASK]f 2007 , according to a report submitted o[MASK] his behalf , Churchill has w[MASK]itten 10 books on his own and co @-@ auth[MASK]red 4 . Some have been reprinted with updates . He has [MASK]ritte[MASK] 51 book[MASK]chapters , 3 law reviews , [MASK]nd 50 scholarly essays ; 27 of these were ref[MASK]reed . He has edited 4 volumes and co [MASK]-@ edited 3 more . 
 Accor[MASK]ing to the Univers[MASK]ty of [MASK]olorado in[MASK]estigation , " His academic pub[MASK]ications are nearly all works of synthesis and reinterpretation , drawing upon studies by other scholars[MASK], not monographs describing new research ba[MASK]ed on prima[MASK]y sources . " The investigation also no[MASK]ed that " he has decided to publish lar[MASK]ely in alternative presses or journals , not in the university presses or mainst[MASK]eam peer @-@ reviewed journals often favored by more conventional academics [MASK] " In additio[MASK] to his academic writing , Chu[MASK]chill has written for several general readership [MASK]agazines o[MASK] political[MASK]opi[MASK]io[MASK] . 
 In 1986 , Churchill wrote an essay[MASK]titled Pacifism as Pathology : Notes on an American Pseudopraxis critic[MASK]zing pacifist politics within the U.S. left as being hypocritical , de facto racist and ineffectual . In 1998 , Arbeiter Ring Publishi[MASK]g published the essay in a book entitled P[MASK]cifis[MASK] as Pathology : Reflections on the Role of Armed Struggle in North America and [MASK]isting Ward Churchill as the author . The book included a preface by Ed Mead ,[MASK]a new int[MASK]oduction t[MASK] the essay by Churchill and a commentary by Mike Ryan . The book sparked much debate in leftist circles [MASK]nd inspired more aggressive tactics within the anti @-@ globalization movement in the following few years . 
 Agents of Repression ( [MASK]988 ) , co @-@ authored by Jim Vand[MASK]r Wall , describes what the authors claim was a secret war against the Black Panther Party and American Indian Movement carried out during th[MASK] late [MASK]960[MASK] and '[MASK]70s by the FBI unde[MASK] the COINTELPRO program . The COINTELPRO Papers ( 1990 ; reissued 2002 ) , also co @-@ autho[MASK]ed [MASK]ith Jim Vander Wall , exa[MASK]ines a series of original FBI memos that detail the Bureau 's activities against various leftist groups , from the U.S. C[MASK][MASK]munist Party in the 1950s to activists c[MASK]ncerned with Central American issue[MASK] in the 1980s . 
 In Fant[MASK]sies of the Master Rac[MASK] ( 1992 ) , Churchill ex[MASK]mines the portrayal of American Indians and the use of American Indian symbols in pop[MASK]lar American culture . He focuses on such p[MASK]enomena as Tony [MASK]illerman[MASK]'s mystery[MASK]novels , the[MASK]film Dances with Wolves , and the New Age movement[MASK], finding examples of cultural imperialism and exp[MASK]oitation . Churchill calls auth[MASK]r Carlos Castaneda 's claims of revealing the teachings of a Yaqui Indian [MASK]ha[MASK]a[MASK] , the " greatest hoax since Piltdown Man . " 
 Struggle for the Land ( 1993 ; reis[MASK]ued 2002 ) is a collect[MASK]on of essays in wh[MASK]ch Churchill chronicles what he describes as [MASK]he U.S. government 's systematic exploitation of Native lands and the killing or displacement of American Indians . He det[MASK]ils Native American efforts[MASK]in the 19th and 20th centuries to prevent defoliation and industrial practices such as surface[MASK]mining . 
 Churchill 's Indians Are Us ? ( 1994 ) , a sequel to Fantasies of the Master Race , further explores American Indian issues in popular culture and politics . He examines the movie Black Robe , the Pine Ridge Indian Reserv[MASK]tion killings[MASK], the prosecution of Leon[MASK]rd Peltier , sports mascots , the Indian Arts and Crafts Act of 1990 , and blood quantum law[MASK] , c[MASK]lling t[MASK]em tools of genocide . Churchill is particularly outspoken [MASK]bout New Age exploitations [MASK]f shamanism and American Indian sacred traditions , and th[MASK] " do @-@ it @-@ yourself Indianism " of [MASK]ertain contemporary authors . John P. LaVelle of the University of New Mexico School of Law publish[MASK]d a rev[MASK][MASK]w[MASK]of Indians Are Us ? in The American Indian[MASK]Quarterly . Professor LaVelle , an enrolled member of the Santee Sioux N[MASK]tion , states that Indians [MASK]re Us ? twists histo[MASK]ical facts and is hostile toward Indian tribes . It was in this book tha[MASK] Churchill first made the clai[MASK] that the United States distributed " smallpox @-@ infested blankets " to Indian tribes , a claim [MASK]hich he repeated several times over the next decade . The claim has been criticized as a falsification . Churchill h[MASK]s , however , received support from some scholars . 
 From a Native Son : Se[MASK]ected Essays on Indigenism , 1985 – 1995 ( 1996 ) is a collection of 23 prev[MASK]ously published essays on Native American history , culture , and p[MASK]litical activism . In [MASK]is introduction to this volume , Howard Zinn lauds " the emergence of a new generation of Native @-@ American scholars " and describes Churchill 's writing [MASK]s " powerful , eloquent , [MASK][MASK]sparing of ca[MASK]t and deception " . 
 Church[MASK]ll 's A Little Matter of Genocide ( 1997 ) is a survey of [MASK]thnic cleansing in the Americas from 1492 to the present . He compares[MASK]the treatment o[MASK] North American Indians to historical instances of genocide by the Khmer Rouge in Cambodia , Turks against Armenians , and Europeans against the Gypsies , as well as Nazis against the Poles and [MASK]ews . 
 In Perversions of Justice ( 2002 ) , Churchill argues that the U.S. ' s legal s[MASK]stem was adapt[MASK]d to gain control over [MASK]ative American people . Tracing the evolution of federal Indian law , Churchill argues that the principles set forth were not only app[MASK]ied to non @-@ Indians in the U.S. , but later adapted for application abroad . He concludes that [MASK]his demonstrates the developm[MASK]nt of t[MASK]e U.S. ' s " imperial logic , " which depends on a " corrupt form of legalism " to establish colonia[MASK] control and empire . 
 Churchill 's controversial essay on 9 / 11 was expanded into a book @-@ length manuscript , published as On the[MASK]Justice of Roosting Chickens : Reflections on the Consequences of U.S. I[MASK]perial Arrogance and Criminality ( 2003 ) by AK Press . The book features two other chapters , one listing US m[MASK]litary interventions[MASK], another list[MASK]ng what Churchill believes to be US violations of inter[MASK]ational law . The original es[MASK]ay takes the " roosting chickens " of the title from a 1963 Malcolm X speech , in which Malcolm X linked the assassination of U.S. president John F. Kennedy to the violence which Kennedy perpetuated as " merely a case of chickens coming home to roost . " Churchill 's essays in this book address the worldwide forms of resistance that he posits were and con[MASK]inue to be provok[MASK]d by U.S. imperialism of [MASK]he 20th and 21st centuries . 
 In Kill the Ind[MASK]an , Save the [MASK]an : The Genocidal I[MASK][MASK]act of A[MASK]erican Indian [MASK]esidential Schools ( 2004 ) , Churchill traces the history of removing American Indian childr[MASK]n fro[MASK] their homes to residential schools ( in Canada ) or Indian boarding schools ( in the USA ) as part of gov[MASK]rnment policies ( 1880s – 1980s ) which he r[MASK]gards as g[MASK]nocidal .

 Churchill has been active since at least[MASK]1984 as the co @-@ director of the Denver @-@ based American Indian Movement of Colorado , now an autonomou[MASK] chapter of the American Indian Movement . In 1993 , he and other local AIM leaders , including Russell Means , Glenn T. Morris , Robert Robideau , an[MASK] David Hill , broke with the national AIM leadership , including Denni[MASK] Banks and the brothers Vernon a[MASK]d Clyde Bellecourt , claiming that all AIM chapters are [MASK]utonomous . The AI[MASK] Grand Governing Council is based in Minneapolis and retains the name of the national group[MASK]. It says that the schism arose when [MASK]eans , Churchill , Glenn T. Morris and othe[MASK]s openly[MASK]supported the Miskito Indian group Misurasata , who were allied with the anti @-@ revolutionary , CIA @-@ backed Contras . 
 Journalists such as Harlan McKosato attributed the split to Means and other AIM members dividing over opposition to the [MASK]ellecourt brothers because of their alleged involvement in the executi[MASK]n of Anna Mae Aq[MASK]ash in December 1975 , who was then the highest @-@ ran[MASK]ing woman in A[MASK]M but had[MASK]been suspected of being an informa[MASK]t . It was a year in which other FBI informants had been discovered in AIM . On November 3 , 1999 , Means held a press conference in Denve[MASK] , Colorado in which [MASK]e accused the Bellecourt brothers of complicity in Aquash 's d[MASK]ath , and named th[MASK]ee lower @-@ [MASK]evel AIM members involved in her death : Arlo Looking Cloud[MASK], John Graham , and Theda Nelson Clark . This was the first time that an AIM leade[MASK] active at the time of the Aquash murder had publicly accused AIM of having been involve[MASK] . 
 Looking Cloud and Graham w[MASK]re convicted of murder in 2004 and 2010 , by federal and South Dako[MASK]a state juries , respectively . By then Clark was being cared for in a nursing home and was not indicted . Means a[MASK]tributed the split in AIM to divi[MASK]ions[MASK]in the aftermath of Aquash 's murder . The journali[MASK]t Harlan McKosato said in 1999 , " ... her [ Aquash 's ] death has divided the American Indian Mo[MASK]emen[MASK] ... " 
 The schism continued , with the nati[MASK]nal AIM leadership claiming that the local AIM leaders , such as Churchill , are tools of the U.S. governme[MASK]t used against other American Indians . Th[MASK] leaders of the national AIM organization , now called AIM Grand Governing Council , claim that Churchill has worked in the past as an undergrou[MASK]d counter @-@ intelligence source for the U.S. government , for example the FBI , and loc[MASK]l , non @-@ Indian , police forces , to subvert the national AI[MASK] organization . Specifically , they refer to a 1993 Boulder , Colorado interview with Jodi Rave , a former colum[MASK]ist for the Denver Post , in which Churchill stated that he " was teaching the Rapid City Police Department about the American Indian Movement . " In[MASK]addition , Vernon Bellecourt accused Chur[MASK]hill of having ' fraudulently represented himself as an Indian ' to bolster his credentials . Bellecourt said he complained to the University of Colorado about this as early as 1986 . 
 Churchill has been a leader of Colorado AIM 's an[MASK]ual protests in Den[MASK][MASK]r against the Columbus Day holiday and i[MASK]s associated parade . Colorado[MASK]AIM 's lea[MASK]ership has come into conflict with some leaders in t[MASK]e Denver Italian Americ[MASK]n community , the main supporters of the parade . As early as 2004 [MASK] Churchill had claimed that such pa[MASK]ades are unconstituti[MASK]nal , ar[MASK]uing that the Ninth Amendment[MASK]to the Constitution provides Nati[MASK]e Americans with a right not to be subjected [MASK]o such displays , overriding the First Amendment rights of non @-@ [MASK]ative Americans . 
 
 [MASK] = 9 / 11 essay controversy = = 
 
 Churchill wrote an essay in September 2001 entitled On the Justice of Roosting Chickens . I[MASK] it , he argued that the September 11 attacks were provoked by U.S. foreign poli[MASK]y . He[MASK]compared the role of fina[MASK]cial workers[MASK]at the Wor[MASK]d Trade Center i[MASK] " ongoing genocidal American imperialism " to the role played by Adolf Eic[MASK]mann in organizing the Holocau[MASK]t . In 2005 , this essay was widely publicized w[MASK]en Hamilton College invited Churchill to speak . This led to both condemnations of Churchill and counter @-@ accusations of McCarthyism by Churchill and supporters . Following the controversy , t[MASK]e University of Colorado interim Chancellor Phil DiStefano said , " While Professo[MASK] Churchill has the constitutiona[MASK] right to express his political views , his essay[MASK][MASK]n 9 / 11 has outraged and appalled us and the general public . " 
 A documentary called Shouting Fire : [MASK]tories from the Edge of Fre[MASK] Speech , broadcast on HBO , prominently features Churchill 's case in addressing the iss[MASK]es of free speech and First Amendment rights .

 [MASK] The controversy attracted increased acad[MASK]mic atte[MASK]tion to Churchill 's research , which had already been criticized by the legal scholar Jo[MASK]n LaVelle and h[MASK]storian Guenter Lewy . Additional critics w[MASK]re the soc[MASK]ologist Thomas Brown , who had [MASK]een preparing an article on Churchill 's work , and[MASK]the historians R.G. Robertson and Ru[MASK]sell Thornton , who claimed that Churchill had misrepres[MASK]nted their work . In 2005 , University of Colo[MASK]ado Boulder adm[MASK]nistrators[MASK]ordered an investigation into seven allegations of research misconduc[MASK] , including three al[MASK]egations of plagiarism , and four allegations of fabrication or falsification regarding the history of [MASK]he Dawes Act , the Indian Art[MASK] and Crafts Act of 1990 , and statements that smallpox was intentionally spread to Native Americans by John Smith in[MASK]1614 and by the United States Army at Fort Clark in 1837 ( not to be confused w[MASK]th the well @-@ documented use of smallpox @-@ infected blankets at F[MASK]rt Pitt in 1764 ) . 
 On May 16 , 2006 the University released their findings ; the Invest[MASK]gative Committee agreed unanimously that Churchill h[MASK]d engaged in " serious research misconduct " , including falsification , fabrication , and two of the three allega[MASK]ions of plagiarism . The committee was divided on the appropriat[MASK] level of sanctions . The Stan[MASK]ing Committee on Research Misconduct accepted the fin[MASK]ings of the Investigat[MASK]ve Committee but a[MASK]so disagreed on what sanctions should be imposed . Churchill 's ap[MASK]eal against his proposed dismissal was considered by a panel of[MASK]the University 's Privilege and Tenure[MASK]Committee , which found that two of the seven [MASK]indings of misconduct di[MASK] not constitute dismissible offences . Three members recommended that the pen[MASK]lty should be demotion and one year 's suspension without pay , while two favored dismissal . 
 On July 24[MASK], 2007 [MASK] the U[MASK][MASK]versity regents voted seven to two to uphold all seven[MASK]of the findings of research m[MASK]sconduct , overruling the recommendation of [MASK]rivilege and Tenure[MASK]panel that two be dismisse[MASK] [MASK][MASK][MASK]y a vote[MASK]of eight to one , th[MASK] regents determined to fire Church[MASK]ll . [MASK] The nex[MASK] day , Churchill file[MASK] a law[MASK]uit in state court claiming that the firing was retribution for his expressing politically unpopular views . The jury in Churchill 's suit for reinstatement weigh[MASK]d the university 's claims of academic misconduct per jury i[MASK]structions it received [MASK]n the case . As Stanley Fish said , " [MASK]t was the jury ’ s task to determine whether Chu[MASK]chill ’ s dismissal wo[MASK]ld have[MASK]occurred independently of the adverse politi[MASK]al response to his co[MASK]stitutionally protected statements . " The[MASK]jury found that the a[MASK]leged misconduct would not have led to Churchill 's firing and reje[MASK]ted the university 's academic misconduct claim as[MASK]the grounds for dismissal . On April 1 , 2009 , a Colo[MASK]ado jury found that Churchill had been wrongly fired , and awarded $ [MASK] in damages . As one of the juror[MASK] said later i[MASK] a press interview , " it wasn 't a slap in his face [MASK]r anything like that when we didn 't give him any money . It '[MASK] just that [ Churchill 's attorney ] David La[MASK]e kept saying this wasn 't about the money , and in the end , we took his wor[MASK] for that . " Chu[MASK]chill 's counsel asked Chief Judge Larry J. Naves of the Denver District Court to order reinstatement in light of the verdict . 
 On July[MASK]7 , 2009 , Judge Naves found that the defendants ( university ) were entitled to quasi @-@ judici[MASK]l immunit[MASK] as a matter of law , vacated the jury[MASK]verdict and determined that the University did not owe Ch[MASK]rchill [MASK]ny financial comp[MASK]nsati[MASK]n . Naves denied Churchill 's request for reinstatement at CU . 
 Churchill appealed both decisions [MASK] On November 24 , 2010 [MASK] a three @-@ judge panel [MASK]f the Colorado Court of Appeals affirme[MASK] the trial court 's decis[MASK]on . In February 2011 , Churchill [MASK]iled a petition for writ of certiorari with the Colorado Supreme Court . In late May 2011 , the Colorado Supreme Court agreed to hear [MASK]is case . Court [MASK]ecords indicate that oral arguments began June 7 , 2012 . On September 10 , 2012 , the court ruled that the University had " quasi @-@ judicial immunity " , [MASK]pholding the trial court 's ruling . On April 1 , 2013 , the U.S. Supreme Court declined to hear an ap[MASK]eal from Churchill .

 " Exit Thro[MASK]gh the Kwik @-@ E @-@ Ma[MASK]t " was written by Marc Wilmore and directed by Steven Dean Moore as part of the twenty [MASK]-@ third season[MASK]of The Simpsons ( 2011 – 12 ) . It spoofs the debated status of street art [MASK]s a true form of art . The title is a r[MASK]ference to Exit Through the Gift Shop , a 2010 street art documentary by graffiti a[MASK]tist Banksy who produced the opening sequence of an earlier Simpsons ep[MASK]sode titled " MoneyBART " ( 201[MASK] [MASK] . The Richard Ha[MASK]ley song " Tonight T[MASK]e Streets Are Ours " , which is the theme song of Exit Through the Gift Shop , is included in the epis[MASK]de during a montage of Bart painting g[MASK]affiti in Springfield . Hayden Childs of The A.[MASK]. Club noted in his review of " Exit Through the Kwik @-@ E @-@ Mart " that the " reveal that the art show[MASK]was a police sting gives the show a moment to joke about the anti @-[MASK] a[MASK]t market theme from Exit Through The Gift Shop . W[MASK]ggum asks who would be st[MASK]pid enough to pay for work that an amateur puts up f[MASK]r free [MASK]n public , and the an[MASK]wer is ,[MASK]as in Banksy ’ s movie , the very wealthy , here represented by Mr. Burns . " 
 American street artist [MASK]airey guest starred in " Exit Through the Kwik @-@ E @-@ Mart " as himself . Th[MASK] graffiti art featuring Homer 's face and the word " dope " that[MASK]Bart creates in the episode is a reference to Fairey 's Barack Obama " Hope " poster and his OBEY Giant imag[MASK] . Fairey has s[MASK]id that The Simpsons has bee[MASK] one of his favorite television shows since the early 1990s because of its " blend of humor and social commentary " , and he felt " deeply [MASK]onored " to be included in an episode . Fairey wrote on his website that [MASK] Part of being on The Simpsons , is you ’ re being honored as a refer[MASK]nce point in cul[MASK]ure . " He described the plot of the episode as " great " , [MASK]dding that the staff members of the show " were kind enoug[MASK] to indu[MASK]ge a co[MASK]ple of my [MASK]ialogue suggestions designed to make the social commentary more pointed [MASK] even though I had to make fun of m[MASK]self to do so ) . " This was F[MASK]irey 's first acting [MASK]erformance . Street artists English , Scharf , and Conal als[MASK] guest [MASK]tarred in the episode a[MASK] thems[MASK]lves . 
 The traditional [MASK]impsons opening sequence was replaced in this episode with a redesigned vers[MASK]on that spoofed the opening sequence of the HBO medieval fantasy series Game of Thrones . The Game of Thrones opening shows the various [MASK]ocations featured in the series on a th[MASK]ee [MASK]-@ dimensional map of the fictional continent Westeros . In the Simpsons opening , these l[MASK]cation[MASK] were substituted with places in Springfield , and The[MASK]Wall was replaced with the[MASK]Simpson family 's couch . The theme song featured in the Game of Thrones opening sequence was arranged by The Simpsons composer Alf Clausen and[MASK]used in the Simpsons opening as well . Nicholas McKaig , known for uploading a cappella co[MASK]er[MASK] of famous songs on YouTube , performed the Simpsons theme song over the closing credits of " Exit Through the Kwik @-@ E @-@ Mart " . He was recruited after a staff member of the show saw his cover of the Simpsons theme on YouTube .

 = Fort Scott National Historic Site = 
 
 Fort Scott National Historic Site is a historical area under the control of the United States National Park Service in Bourbon County , Kansas [MASK] United States . Named after General Winfield Scott , who achieved renown during the Mexican @-@ Ameri[MASK]an War , during the middle of the 19th century the fort served as a military base for US Army action in what was the edge of settlement in 1850 . For the n[MASK]xt quarter century , it was used as a[MASK]su[MASK]ply base and to [MASK]rovide securi[MASK]y in turbulent areas during the opening of the West to settlement , a per[MASK]od which included Bleeding Kansas and the American Civil War . 
 The current national historic site protects 20 his[MASK][MASK]ric structures , a parade ground , and five acres ( 20 @,@ 000 m ² ) of restored tallgrass[MASK]prairie , inside the city of Fort Scott . It is open to visitors most days of the year .

 In 1842 , Fort Scott was named after Winfield Scott , w[MASK]s established on t[MASK]e Am[MASK]rican frontier[MASK]on the military road in eastern Kansas between Fo[MASK]t Leavenworth [MASK]nd Fort Gibson . It was establis[MASK]ed to provide protection to the[MASK]rapidly increasing number of[MASK]settlers , who were migrating from the Eastern United States . Fort Scott became one of a chain[MASK]of forts intended to protect t[MASK]e new settlers from the Plains [MASK]ndians , as we[MASK]l as to protect the Indians from the settlers ' encroachment . 
 The United States government inte[MASK]tion to reserve permanent Indian lands west of the Miss[MASK]uri River gave way to the competition of settlers continuing to encroach on the Indian[MASK]settlements . Fort Scott[MASK][MASK]s most active days were between 1842 and 1853 , although it wa[MASK] also used during the Civil War . 
 
 = = = Army days = = = 
 
 The Cherokee of Indian Territory ( now Oklahoma ) were upset to have Fort Wayne in t[MASK]eir proximity . After some delay , the US Army decided to a[MASK]andon Fort Wayne and move its soldiers to a new f[MASK]rt to be built between F[MASK]rt Leaven[MASK]orth and the site . The Army both wanted to pl[MASK]cat[MASK] the Cherokee ( who were supervised by the Department of Defense ) and provide more defense for white[MASK]settlers and other Indians against the Osage , who had been conducting frequent raids in the area . On April 1 , 1842 , some soldiers of Fort Wa[MASK]ne left their fort and on Ap[MASK]il 22 arrived where Fort Scott would be built , in the Osage C[MASK]estas section of modern @-@ day Kansas[MASK]. After haggling with the Cherokees to acquire[MASK]t[MASK]e land , the r[MASK]st of Fort Wayne 's garrison left the[MASK]fort on May 26 and arrived at the Fort Scott site on May 30 . 
 Unlike most fort[MASK] for military use , the fort did not have[MASK]defensive walls or structures when first built ; the wi[MASK]e @-@ open ar[MASK]a and the avai[MASK]able artillery made an enclosed fort unnecessary . The s[MASK]ldiers concentrated on building structures for lodging the men , animals , and equipment . Thes[MASK] buildings were on the edges of a 350 @-@ foot ( 110 m ) parade ground . 
 The post quar[MASK]ermaster , Captain Thomas Swords , was in cha[MASK]ge of building Fort Scott 's structures , and had to deal with the problems of construction on the Kansas prairie , which had few trees . He had only two bricklayers and three carpente[MASK]s to re[MASK]y on , a[MASK] there were few civilians and most of [MASK]he soldiers had other duties to perform . Wood was available , but the mill was built 1 @.@ 5 miles ( 2 @.@ 4 km ) away [MASK] [MASK]aking transport time consuming . Swords found his efforts [MASK]lagued by lack of wood , skilled labor and working equipment . Freak accidents d[MASK]stroyed much of the wood intende[MASK] for the fort 's construction . As a result , only one duplex of the five planned officers quarters ( four duplexes and post commandant 's [MASK]ouse ) was built [MASK]y 1[MASK]44 , and the intended enlisted barracks were not co[MASK]pleted [MASK] In his 1844 inspection of the fort , Colonel [MASK]eorge Croghan reporte[MASK] that , in comparison to other frontier forts , he considered Fort Scott " above averag[MASK] " . 
 Due to the rising tensions that esca[MASK]ated in the Mexican @-@ American War , the US Army redeployed troops to the Southwest . With Fort Scott still [MASK]ncompleted , official[MASK] decided on April 25 , 1850 , that no more construction would be done there [MASK] after eight years and $ 35 @,@ 000 . By the time it [MASK]as finished , it was obsolete ; three years later , it was abandoned by the military in favor [MASK]f the more wes[MASK]ern Fort Riley . 
 For the average soldier , life at the fort was " monotonous " . Until the permanent structures were [MASK]uilt , soldiers h[MASK]d to live in tents , which lacked comfort . Aside from a few whiskey peddlers and prostitutes , few civilians lived[MASK]at the fort . Officers[MASK]had brought their personal slaves [MASK]ith them , including Captain Swords . Five miles [MASK]ast in Missouri w[MASK]s a grog sh[MASK]p that supplied soldiers , and qui[MASK]e a few [MASK]ourts @-@ martial followed soldiers ' going AWOL at the shop . The dese[MASK]tion rate from the fort ranged from 12 %[MASK]-16 [MASK] , [MASK]ue to boredom , irregular[MASK]pay , and hatred for military life . As no combat took place near the fort , it seemed more of a frontier village than a military base . Hunting was a popular pastime ; acco[MASK]ding to Captain Sword[MASK] , " wolf chasing and duck hunting " was the only way one officer could tolera[MASK]e the place . 
 
 = = = Bleeding Kansas = = = 
 
 Tw[MASK] years after the army abando[MASK]ed the fort , the buildings were sold by auction to civilians , with two being converted to hotels . In 1854 the Kansas @-@ Nebraska Act repea[MASK]ed the Missouri Compromise of 1820 , which had kept [MASK][MASK]avery out of Kansas . Missourians in [MASK]avor of slavery soon moved to Kansas to try to sway the vote of whether or [MASK]ot Kansas would permit slavery . Settlers from New England arrived equally determined to keep it out . Each of the two competing factions of the Bleeding Kansas conflict claimed one of the hotels at Fort [MASK]cott : Free @-@ Soil at the Fort Scott [MASK]otel and Pro @-@ Slavery at [MASK]he Western Hotel . Mos[MASK] of the residents in Fort Scott supported slavery , but those outside the town tended t[MASK] the free @-@ soil side . During this time ,[MASK]there were[MASK]local incidents of murder and attem[MASK]ted arson ,[MASK]typical element[MASK] of the [MASK]uerrilla conflicts that[MASK]were prevalent in the fighting .

 During the American Civil War , the fort was rene[MASK]e[MASK] as a US military post . In August 1861 , the Union Army took command of Fort Scott , and readied it for the war times . The United States Army also took over severa[MASK] blocks within the t[MASK]wn fo[MASK] commis[MASK]ary and quartermas[MASK]er functions . The Union [MASK]rmy rented the properties from the current c[MASK]vilian owners . Troops from Indiana , Iowa , Colorado , Ohio , a[MASK]d Wisconsin would come to the f[MASK]rt , and either stayed by the fort , or traveled farther , to subjugate Missouri [MASK] Arkan[MASK]as , or the Indian Territory . Fort Scott was one of the few installations that re[MASK]ruite[MASK] and trained blac[MASK] soldiers for the United Sta[MASK]es Colored Troops of the Union Army . 
[MASK]A major supply depot was situated at the fort . Confe[MASK]erate general Sterlin[MASK] Price hoped to [MASK]apture the town , but the closest the Confederate force came to t[MASK]e garrison was 10 miles ( 16 km ) away at Battle of Dry W[MASK]od Creek . The site was strategically important as it was within a Southern @-@ sympathizing area and close t[MASK] the Confederate state of Arka[MASK]sas and the " unstable " Indian Territory ( present @-@ day state of Oklahoma ) , where[MASK]many of the members o[MASK] the Five Civilized Tribes were[MASK]allied with the Conf[MASK]derates . The fort served as a " general hospital " ( large military hospital ) and prison until after the war . Following the end of the war , in Oc[MASK]ober 1865 the US Army left the facilities [MASK]nd sold off by auction what they controlled . 
 On J[MASK]nuary 14 , 1870 , the Army returned with the formation of the Post of Southeast Kansa[MASK] . The Post was based at Fort Scott , but the [MASK]oldiers camped along the rail tracks , and sel[MASK]om used the original fort . They were sent to protect the railroad[MASK] and workers from settlers . Some of the latter feared that[MASK]the railroad , which had been awarded land for development by the US Government in rights @-@ of @-@ way , would evic[MASK] t[MASK]em from their squatter homes . The settlers considered the [MASK]roops lacke[MASK]s to the railroads , and lumped both as enemies . 
 Settlers also h[MASK]d some continuing conflicts with Indians and insurge[MASK]ts using the recent Confederate cause as excuse for robbery . By th[MASK] spring of 1873 , the[MASK]US Army withdrew the troops from Fort Scott for good . From 1873 to 1965 , the bu[MASK]ldings of the fort were l[MASK]ft unattended , and slowly deteriora[MASK]ed .[MASK]Many military buildings were razed and replaced with structures built for civilian use .

 With the Act of August 31 , 1965 , the National Park Service g[MASK]ve the city government of Fo[MASK]t [MASK]cott , Kansas the necessary funds and technical knowledge to restore the fort . 
 On October 19 , 1978 , Fort Scott became a National Historic Site under the supervision of the National Park Service , encompassing 17 acres ( 69[MASK]@,@ 000 m2 ) . Today the fort is open throug[MASK]out the year , sa[MASK]e for Thanksgiving , Christmas , and New Year[MASK] Day . Visitation has declined in recent years .

 Slammiversary featured seven prof[MASK]ssional w[MASK]estling matches and one pre @-@ show match that involved [MASK]ifferen[MASK] wr[MASK]s[MASK]lers from pre @-@ existing [MASK]cri[MASK]ted feuds and storylines . Wrestlers portrayed villains , heroes , or less distinguishable characte[MASK]s in the scripted events that built[MASK]tension and culminated in a wrestling match or series of matches . 
 [MASK]he[MASK]main event at Slammiversary was a King of the Mountain match for the TNA World Heavyweight Championsh[MASK]p , in which the[MASK] @-@ champion S[MASK]moa Joe defended the title against four other competitors .

 A total of 2 @,@ 000 people attended Slamm[MASK]versary[MASK], while the The Wrestli[MASK]g Observer N[MASK]wsletter r[MASK]ported that 20 @,@ 000 peopl[MASK] bought the [MASK]vent . Canadian Online Explorer writer Jon Waldman rated the entire event a 7 out of 10 , which was lower than the 8 out of 10 gi[MASK]e[MASK] to the 2007 edition by Jason Clevett . The 7 out of 10 was the same rating given to the 2009 edition by Chris and Bryan Sokol . The previous PPV event Sacrific[MASK] and TNA 's next PPV e[MASK]ent Victory Road both received a 7 out of 10 by Chris Sokol an[MASK] Bob Kapur , respectively . Compared to rival World Wrestling E[MASK]tertainment 's ( WWE ) On[MASK] Night Stand PPV event on June 1 , both performed equally , as One Night Stand received the same rating from Matt Mackinder . [MASK] Wa[MASK][MASK]man felt that " TNA put on a stro[MASK]g PPV " that was in " l[MASK]rge part to little gimmickery . " Regarding the main even[MASK] ,[MASK]Waldman ga[MASK]e it a 6 out[MASK]of 10 , while th[MASK] World T[MASK]g Team Championship match recei[MASK]ed a 4 out of 10 . He gav[MASK] the Six Woman Tag Team match a 4 @.@ 5 out of[MASK]10 and the A.J. Styles versus Kurt Angle bout a 9 out of 10 . Th[MASK] X [MASK]ivision Championship contest was given a 7 out of 10 . 
 Wade Keller of the Pro Wrestling Torch Newsletter review[MASK]d the show . He felt the main event had " lots of action and [MASK]rama , " but that having to hang the belt on a hook does n[MASK]t make for a " particularly dramatic end to a match as it seems[MASK]l[MASK]ke someone hanging a pla[MASK]t in the corner " than " beating s[MASK]meone to win a fight . " Keller said the World Tag Team Championship contest was a " solid tag match " with some [MASK] e[MASK]aborate sequences " that were " well executed . " Keller stated that th[MASK] X Division Championship match was a " very good opener . " Regarding the Styles and Angle bout , Keller commented that [MASK]t was a "[MASK]good[MASK]match , but [MASK][MASK]ort of a classic must @-@ see match in part because there were to[MASK] many chinlocks mid @-@ match from Angle that took the crowd out of it . " 
 Jame[MASK] Caldwell , also of the Pro Wrestling [MASK]orch Newsletter , posted a review of the show in which he felt the main event was a " slow , plodding match " with an " anticlimacti[MASK] finish . " Caldwell stat[MASK]d that the Styles versus Angle contest was a [MASK] fine spotlight singles ma[MASK]ch , " but was a " bit underwhelmi[MASK]g when the expectations were reasonably high for two of TNA 's best wrestlers in a featured singles match . " He[MASK]went on to say that he felt it was " missing something " and that it " s[MASK]emed like the match just never moved out of[MASK]second gear . Caldwell felt the X Divisio[MASK] Championship bout was a " very go[MASK]d opening match , " which " could have been a fe[MASK]tured match to sell a few additional PPV buys , but TNA didn 't give the X Division any foc[MASK]s until the fi[MASK]al show before the PPV . " Caldwell stated the World Tag Tea[MASK] Championship was " just a slow , plodding tag match [MASK] " Regarding the marriage segment during the s[MASK]ow , Caldwell[MASK]said " it was just a bad , ba[MASK] , bad segment that died slowly and painfully in front of the live audience . " Overall , Caldwell felt that " TNA showcased the[MASK]X Division in the opening match , " b[MASK]t needed more " athleticism on the show to bal[MASK]nce the slow , plodding forme[MASK] WWE heavyweight wrestlers in the main [MASK]vent slots .

 Home[MASK]Made M[MASK]nce Pie is a 1910 American silent short comedy produced by the Thanhouser Company . The film is a comedy of circumstances , in which the Gale[MASK]family is going to host a [MASK]inner . The focus of the humor is in a mince pie that brandy is added to in an attempt to make it more apprecia[MASK]le , but three[MASK]people each add brandy to the pie . Everyone becomes tipsy[MASK]upon eating the pie , including the family c[MASK]t , and the film concludes . No cas[MASK] or staff c[MASK]edits for this film are known[MASK]. The film was released [MASK]n September 27 , 1910 , to mixed reviews in trade publications . Reviewers mentioned [MASK]hat the fi[MASK]m[MASK]was too l[MASK]ng and it was unbelievable [MASK]hat one pie split [MASK]ight ways would be able to impact everyone . The film is presumed lost . 
 
 = = Plot = = 
 
 Tho[MASK]gh t[MASK]e film is presumed lo[MASK]t , a synopsis survives in[MASK]The Moving Picture World from Septemb[MASK]r 24 , 1910 . It states : " Life in a [MASK]ount[MASK]y town is often tedious and[MASK]tiresome , and were it not for the little d[MASK]nners and t[MASK]as the townsfolk are [MASK]onstantly [MASK]ive[MASK] , ex[MASK]stence in some[MASK]localities wo[MASK]ld b[MASK] a very dreary thing indeed . So the time honored get @-@ togethers of the small town are an established feature to the social calendar ; they are just as mu[MASK]h a matt[MASK]r of necessity and as such have come to stay . The Ga[MASK]es thought well of this estab[MASK]ished featur[MASK] . They made it a joyous occasion for themselves as well as their guests . They were hardly an overly wealthy family , and their table was never notable for an oversupply of the good things of life ,[MASK]but whenever they gave a dinner they[MASK]cast all thoughts of economy to the country winds and worked to the one end th[MASK]t their guests have a pleasant time . " 
 " On the night before such an event neither Mamma , Pappa , or Daughter Gale could get those minutes ' solid sleep f[MASK]r thought that t[MASK]ey might have overlooked some essential in the guests ' comfort . At the first crow of the rooster they would come [MASK]opping down to [MASK]he kitche[MASK] to get the larder into shape . S[MASK] little wonder that on [MASK]ccasion of the dinner here[MASK]pictur[MASK]d - when the prize dis[MASK] was a splendid homemade mince pie - the Gales were ever looking after the need of the said pie . F[MASK]rst Mamma Gale would tiptoe to the table w[MASK]ereupon it sat in solemn state , [MASK]nd give it [MASK] stir ; then Pappa Gale woul[MASK] tiptoe over and give it a stir ; finally Da[MASK]ghter Gale would have to come over and honor [MASK]t likewise . Then arrived the[MASK]guests . The Minister and the Mrs. Minister , they were , and some neighbors . W[MASK]ile she was rece[MASK]ving them the recollect[MASK]on came to Mamma Gale that the beloved mince pie had not received its flavorin[MASK] . Off s[MASK]e speeds to a decanter of whiskey in the kitchen . She pours into the pie the right proportion of liquor , and goes back to her guests . Then Pappa G[MASK]le remembers that the pie has not been flavored . He , too , excuses himself an[MASK] a moment later is found pouring whiskey into the sacred mince . No sooner has [MASK]e ceased and returned to his g[MASK]est than Daughter Gale , who has just remembered about [MASK]he forgotten flavoring , rushes in and makes for [MASK]he whiskey .[MASK]She pours ' the right proportion ' in , too .

 The writer[MASK]of t[MASK]e scenario is unk[MASK]own , but it was [MASK]ost likely Lloyd Lonergan . He was an experienced newspaperman employed by The New York[MASK]Evening World while [MASK]riting scripts for the Tha[MASK]houser product[MASK]ons . The film director is unknown , but it may have been Barry O 'Neil . Film historian Q. David Bowers does not attribute a camer[MASK]man for t[MASK]is production[MASK], but at least two possible candidates exist . Blair Smith was the first cameraman of the Thanhouser c[MASK]mpany , but he was soon joine[MASK] by Carl Louis Gregory who had y[MASK]ars of experien[MASK]e as a st[MASK]ll and motion picture photographer . The role of the cameraman was uncredited in 1910 productions . The cast credits are unknown[MASK], but many 1910[MASK]Th[MASK]nhouser productions are fragmentary . In late 1910 , the Thanh[MASK]user c[MASK]mpany released a list of the important personalities in their films . The list include[MASK] G.W. Abbe , Justus D. Barnes , Frank H.

 The single reel comedy , approximately 1 @,@ 000 feet long ,[MASK]was released on September 27 , 1910 . The film likely had [MASK] wide national release , with advertisements i[MASK] theaters known in Indiana , Kansas , Wisconsin , and Pennsylvania . The film wou[MASK]d also b[MASK] shown in Vancouver , Canada and was met with praise by t[MASK]e audie[MASK]ce at the Province Theatre . In 1917 [MASK] years after the film 's release , the film was approved without censorship by the Pennsylvania State Board of Censors of Moving Pictures .[MASK]
 The The Moving Picture Wo[MASK]ld reviewer found the subject to be too long , but did no[MASK] find it to be a fault . The reviewer states , " A domestic co[MASK]edy with a differ[MASK]nt flavor . In fact ,[MASK]with a mince pie for a basis the flavor comes to resemble brandy very st[MASK]ongly by the time that the[MASK]cook , the maid and the mistress of th[MASK] house and her daughte[MASK] have added the pro[MASK]er proportion of flavoring , neither one knowing that the[MASK]others have done lik[MASK]wise . The humor in this piece centers around this pie . What happened to the guests who partook of it certainly draws upon the [MASK]magina[MASK]ion . Imagine eight people [MASK] not to speak of the cat , getting drunk on the brandy in one mi[MASK]ce pie ! ... We do not single out this subject as bei[MASK]g m[MASK]re[MASK]eviden[MASK]ly padded than others shown on the screen this week . Licensed as well as Independents were guilty[MASK]and it [MASK]s time that the manuf[MASK]cturers realize the importance of the scenario end of matters . The [MASK]ince pie episode was well done[MASK], which is the faint praise that we do [MASK]ot like to mete out to an[MASK]one . " Walton of The Moving Picture News was not amused by t[MASK]e plot and stated , "[MASK]To me the last scene had no humor . It was only[MASK]the necessary ending to the beginning . Tr[MASK]e humor does not emanate from cognac . " The N[MASK]w York Dramatic Mirror stated , " This is the old story of too[MASK]many cooks , and it is quite funny after the first s[MASK]enes are out of the way . The early part of the film takes too much time with trivial details l[MASK]ading up to the final situation . ... A weak point [MASK]n the story is the fact t[MASK]at the pie is cut into eight small pieces , making it difficult to believe in its remarkable power . Two pies would have been as easy to make as one and would have been mor[MASK] convincing . The character parts are all we[MASK]l taken , although the cook would have been better if she had not seized so many opportunities to [MASK]alk directly at the camera . "

Starr 's former Beat[MASK]es bandmate George Harrison produced the recording , which took place in London shortly a[MASK]ter the two had app[MASK]ared t[MASK]gether at Harrison 's Concert for Bangladesh shows in August 1971 . The single was a follow @-@ up to Starr 's 1971[MASK]hit song " It Don 't Come Easy " and continued his successful run as a solo artist . " Back Off Boogaloo " peaked at number 2 in Britain and Canada , and number 9 on America 's Billboard Hot 100 . It remains Starr 's highest @-@ charting single in the United Kingdom . 
[MASK]The title [MASK]or the song was in[MASK]pired by English singer @-@ songwriter Marc Bolan . Some comment[MASK]tors[MASK]have suggested that the lyrics were directed at Paul McCartney , reflecting Starr 's disdain for the mu[MASK]ic M[MASK]Cartney had made as a solo artist over[MASK]the previous two ye[MASK]rs . " Back Off Boogaloo " demonstrates the influence of glam rock on Starr , who directed a documentary film , Born to Boogie ( 1972 ) ,[MASK]about Bolan 's [MASK]and T. Re[MASK] around this time . Described b[MASK] one author as a " high @-@ energy [MASK]n @-@ your @-@ face rocker " , the son[MASK] features a prominent slide guitar pa[MASK]t by Harrison and contributions from musicians Gary Wright and Klaus Voormann . 
 Starr re @-@ recorded " Back Off B[MASK]ogaloo " f[MASK]r his 1981 album Stop and Smell the Roses , in a collaboration with American singer Harry Nilsson that incorporates lyrics from Beatles songs such as " With [MASK] Little Help from My Friends " , " Good Day Sunshine " and " Baby , You 're a Rich Man " . The original version [MASK]as appeared on Starr 's compilation albums Blast from Your Past and Photograph [MASK] The Very Best of Ringo Starr , [MASK]nd[MASK]as a bonus track on his remastered 1974 studio[MASK]album Goodnight Vienna [MASK] Since his return[MASK]to touring in 198[MASK] , S[MASK]arr [MASK]as performed " Back Off Boogaloo " regularly in concert with the various incarnations of his All @-@ Starr Band .

 Ringo[MASK]Starr identified his initial ins[MASK]iration for " Back Off Boogaloo " as having come from Marc Bol[MASK]n , the singer and guitarist with English glam r[MASK]ck[MASK]band T. Rex . In a 2001 interview with Mojo editor Paul Du Noye[MASK] , Starr described Bolan as [MASK] a dear friend who used to come into the office when I was running Apple Movies , a bi[MASK] offi[MASK]e in town , and the hang @-@ o[MASK]t for myself , Harry Nilsson[MASK]and Keith Moon " . Over dinner one evening at [MASK]tarr 's home outsi[MASK]e London , Bolan had used the word " boogaloo " so often th[MASK]t it stuck in Starr 's mind , after which the bea[MASK] and melody for the song [MASK]ame to him overnight . When discussing the composit[MASK]on on VH1 Storytellers in May 1998 , Starr explained : " [ Bolan ] was an energised guy . He used to speak : ' Back off boog[MASK]loo ... ooh you , boogaloo . ' ' Do you want some potatoes ? ' ' Ooh you , [MASK]oogaloo ! ' " Starr a[MASK]so recalled having to take the batteries out of his children 's toys that night , in order to power a tape recorder and m[MASK]ke a recording of the new song . 
 The lyrics to the middle eight of " Back Off Boo[MASK]aloo " came to Starr while watching London Weekend Television 's[MASK]foot[MASK]all show , The Big Match . The program 's host , Jimmy Hill , ofte[MASK] referred to a footballer 's pl[MASK][MASK]ing as " tasty " , a catchphrase that [MASK]tar[MASK] incorporated into his song lyrics : 
 Get yourself together now 
 And give me something tasty 
 Everything you try to do 
 You know it sure sounds wasted . 
 [MASK]ommentators have interpreted th[MASK] [MASK]ong , and particularly this statement , as an attack by Starr on his former[MASK]Beatles bandmate Paul McCartney . Starr has denied any such interpretation , instead " claiming that the song was inspired by Bolan and nothing more " , Beatles biogra[MASK][MASK]er Robert Rodriguez writes . Starr had [MASK]ublicly criticised M[MASK]Cartney 's solo alb[MASK]ms Mc[MASK]artney ( 1970 ) an[MASK] Ram ( 1[MASK]71 ) on release , and author B[MASK]uce Spizer paraphrase[MASK] the message of the [MASK]iddle ei[MASK]ht as " a plea for Paul to [MASK]roduce better music " . The mention of " sound [ [MASK]ng ] wasted " could also be a reference to McCartney 's overindulgence[MASK]with cannabis , Rodriguez suggests . A further example of Starr 's allegedly anti @-@ McCartney message exists in the song[MASK]'s first verse : 
 Wake up , meathead 
 Don 't pretend that [MASK]ou are dead 
 Get yourself up off the cart . 
 The same commentators suggest t[MASK]at here Starr could be ref[MASK]rri[MASK]g to the 1969 " Paul Is Dead " hoax . The latter rumour circulated during September and October of that year while McCartney hid away on his S[MASK]ottish farm , disconsolate after John Lennon had told him and Starr that he [MASK]anted a " divorce " fr[MASK]m[MASK]the Beatles . 
 In addition to these sup[MASK]osed m[MASK]ssages in " Back Off Boogaloo " , observers have viewed the song title as Starr 's rebuke to McCartney to abandon his legal stand against the Bea[MASK]les and Apple Corps , which[MASK]was placed in receivership in March 1971 after a High Court judge found in M[MASK]Cartney 's favour . Author Keith [MASK]adman writes that " Boogaloo " had " long been cited as Paul 's nickname " from his former bandmates Starr , Lennon and George Harrison . While acknowledging that [MASK]n subsequent years Starr might have chosen to minimise any ill @-@ feeling towards McCartney , Rodriguez notes that the lyrics " just ha[MASK]pened to fit[MASK]perfectly into the ' us vs. Paul ' minds[MASK]t " following the Beatles ' b[MASK]eak @-@ up , to the extent that " Back Off Boogaloo " was " as damning as ' Early 1970 ' had been conciliatory " . When tailoring his 1970 composition " I 'm the[MASK]Greatest " for Starr to record on the album Ringo ( 1973 ) , Lennon referenced the song ti[MASK]le w[MASK]th the lines " Now I 'm only thirty @-@ two / And all I want to do is boogaloo " . 
 Although " T Rex devotees " , in the words of Starr biographer Alan C[MASK]ayson , claimed that Bolan had ghost @-@ written " Back Off Boogaloo [MASK] , Starr later acknowledged that Harrison co @-@ wrote the song by adding some chords and finishing the melody . As on Starr 's 1971 [MASK]it single " It Don 't Come Easy " , Harrison was not credited for his song[MASK]riting cont[MASK]ibution . Starr origi[MASK]a[MASK]ly offered " Back Off Boogaloo " to fello[MASK] Liverpudlian Cilla Black to record , but she declined , hoping instead to record[MASK]another new Starr – Harrison composition , " Photograph " .

 Having earmarked the song as his next single [MASK] Starr recorded "[MASK]Back O[MASK]f Boogaloo " in September 1971 , following his a[MASK]pearance at the Harrison @-@ organised Concert for Bangladesh in New York . The sessions took place at Apple S[MASK]udio in central Lo[MASK]don , with Harrison producing , as he had on " It Don 't Come Easy " . The recording reflects the influence of glam rock on Starr through what [MASK]uthors Chip Madinger and Mark Easter term [MASK] its big drum sound and repetitious nature " , with a line @-@ up comprising Starr ( vocals , drums , percussion ) , Harriso[MASK] ( guitars ) , Gary Wright ( piano ) and Klau[MASK] Voormann ( bass , saxophone ) . 
 Rodriguez describes Starr 's " martial @-@ sounding opening " [MASK]s a rare " showcase f[MASK]r his own drumming " , while Harrison biographer Sim[MASK]n Leng writes of " a roaring series of Ha[MASK]rison slide breaks that brought to mind Duane Allman " . Further overdubs included contributions from[MASK]thre[MASK] backing vocalists , led by American soul [MASK]inger Madeline Bell .

 For the single 's B @-@ side , Starr had already written and recorded " Bli[MASK]dman " , the theme song for th[MASK] Ferdinando Baldi @-@ directed Spaghetti Western of the same name , filming for which Starr had interrupted in order to perform at the Concert for Bangladesh . Starr produced the track with Voormann . The sess[MASK]ons for " Blindman [MASK] took place at Apple on 18 – 19 August , with Badfinger guitarist Pete Ham assisting Starr and Voo[MASK]mann . Like the film Blindman ( 1971 ) , the so[MASK]g i[MASK] held in low re[MASK]ard by critics ; Spizer describes it as " a muddy @-@ sounding dirge with little to recomme[MASK]d " .

 Apple Records issued the single on 17 March 1972 in Britain , as Apple R 5944 , with a US release taking place three days later , as Apple 1849 . It w[MASK]s Starr 's first release since " It Don 't Come Easy " , a year be[MASK]ore . During this period , his priority had been to develop a career as an actor in films suc[MASK] as 200 Motels ( 1971 ) [MASK]nd Blindman . Further aligning [MASK]imself [MASK]it[MASK] Britain 's glam rock movement , Starr ma[MASK]e his directorial debut with Born[MASK]to Boogie ([MASK]1972 ) , a film starring Bolan that included Starr 's footage of a T. Rex concert held at W[MASK]m[MASK]ley on 18 March . With " Back Off Boogaloo " , NME cr[MASK]tic Bob Woffinden noted Starr 's success in esta[MASK]lishing [MASK]imself in [MASK]he two years since the Beatles '[MASK]break @-@ up , and wrote that the single " confirmed that he and Harrison [MASK] dark horses both , were the ones [MASK]ho had managed their solo careers more purposefully and i[MASK]telligently " compared with McCartney and Lennon . 
 The song was a hit in the US , reaching number 9 o[MASK] the Billboard[MASK]Hot 100 [MASK] a[MASK]d achieved Starr 's best position on [MASK]he UK Singles Chart[MASK],[MASK]where it reached number 2 . A promotional video for " B[MASK]ck Off B[MASK]ogaloo " was shot on 20 [MASK]arch at Lennon 's Tittenhurst P[MASK][MASK]k residence while Starr was looking after t[MASK]e property . The video , whi[MASK]h shows Starr walking around an outdoor structure and followed by[MASK]a Frankenstein @-@ like[MASK]monster , was direct[MASK]d by[MASK]Tom Taylor and financed by Caravel Films . A simil[MASK]r monster appeared on the single 's picture sleeve , holding a cigarette . 
 Alan Cl[MASK]yson writes of reviewers criticising " Back Off Boogaloo " for being repetitious , leading Starr to respond in a 1973 interview : " Play me a po[MASK] song that isn 't . " On release , Chris Welch wrote in Melody Maker : " A Number One hit could easily be in store for the maestro of rock drums . There 's a touch of the Marc Bolans in this highly playable rhythmic excursion ... It 's hypnotic and effect[MASK]ve , ideal for jukeboxes and liable to send us all mad by the end[MASK]of the week . " Woffinden described the single as " every bit as ebull[MASK]ent " as[MASK]" It Don 't Co[MASK]e Easy "[MASK], although " slightly inferior " , while Mike DeG[MASK]gne of AllMusic views it as a son[MASK] where " [ [MASK] ][MASK]he [MASK]ovial spirit of Ringo Starr shines through " . In a 1974 article for the NME , Char[MASK]es Shaar Murray highlighted " Back Off Boogaloo " as a " great radio and juke @-@ box tu[MASK]e " . 
 Among Beatle b[MASK]ographers[MASK], Simon Leng terms it " a rocking , soccer[MASK]crowd chant that suited Sta[MASK]r 's talents well " , and Bruce Spizer praises the track as a " high @-@ energy in @-@ your @-@ face rocker [MASK]ropelled by R[MASK]ngo 's thundering drums and George 's stinging slide guitar " . In the[MASK]2005 publ[MASK]cation NME Originals : Beatles – The Solo Years 1970 – 1980 , Paul Moody listed " Back Off Bo[MASK]ga[MASK]oo " first among Starr 's " ten solo gems " and described it as " Good time rock 'n'droll to match the Faces " . Guitar World editor Damian Fanelli includes the song on his list of Harrison 's ten best post @-@ Beatles " Guitar[MASK]Moments " , saying of the recording : " the main event is clearly Harrison 's slightly wild , wacky – and very bouncy – slide guitar solo , which includes an alternate melody line that 's even catchier than the melody Ringo is singing . " 
 Re @-@ relea[MASK]es for " Back O[MASK]f Boogaloo " include Starr 's 1975 greatest hits al[MASK]um , Blast from Your Past , and , along with " Blindman " , as a bonus track on the 1992 reissue of his [MASK]oodnight [MASK]ienna album ( 1974 ) . " Back Off Boogaloo " also appeared on his 2007 compilation Photograph : The Very Best of Ringo Starr , the collector 's edition of which included his 1972 video for the song .

 Starr recorded a new version of " Back[MASK]Off Booga[MASK]oo " for his 1981 album on Boardwalk Records , Stop and Smell the Roses . The son[MASK] was produced by Starr 's friend , singer Harry Nilsson , and features a musical arrangement by Van Dyke Parks .[MASK]Similar to Nilsson 's 1968 cover of the Beatles ' " You Can 't Do That " , the remake incorporates lyri[MASK]s from a number of the band 's songs – in this case , " With [MASK] Little Hel[MASK] from My Friends " , " Help[MASK]! " , " Lady Madonna " , "[MASK]Good Day Sunshine " and " Baby , You 're[MASK]a Rich Man " , as well as Star[MASK] 's " It D[MASK]n 't Come Easy " . In [MASK] further reference to his past , the 1981 vers[MASK]on of " Back Off Boogaloo " opens with the same guitar riff that Harri[MASK]on had played on " It Do[MASK] 't Come Easy " ten years before[MASK]. [MASK] [MASK][MASK]arr taped the basic tr[MASK]ck at Evergre[MASK]n Recording Studios in Los Angeles on 4 November 1980 , with additional [MASK]ecording taking place on 1 – 5[MASK]De[MASK]em[MASK]er at Nassau 's[MASK]Compass Point Studios . Among the large cast of musicians supporting Starr were Nilsson ( vocals ) , Jim Keltner ( drums ) , Jane Getz ( pia[MASK]o ) , D[MASK]nnis Budimir and Richie Zito ( guitars ) , and a four @-@ piece horn se[MASK]tion led by saxophonist Jerry Jumonville . 
 Starr overdubbed his vocals on 4 December , four days before the murder of John Lennon , who had been due to record his [MASK]ontributions to Stop and Smell the Roses in January 1981 . Contrasting with his success[MASK]as a solo artist in 1971 – 73 , the album continued Starr 's run of commercial and criti[MASK]al failu[MASK]es since 1976 ; Rodrig[MASK]ez writes that " [ m ] ost people eithe[MASK] love or hate the revamping " of " Ba[MASK]k Off Boogaloo[MASK]" .

 " Where the Streets Have No Name " is a song by I[MASK]ish r[MASK]ck band U2 . It is the opening track from their 1987 album The Joshua Tree and was r[MASK]leased as the album 's third single in August 1987 . The song[MASK]'s hook is a repeating guitar arpeggio using a delay effec[MASK] , played during the song 's introduction and[MASK]again at the end . Lead vocalist[MASK]Bono wrote the lyrics[MASK]in response to the notion that it is [MASK]ossible to identify a person 's religion and income based on the street on which they lived , particularly in Belfast . During the band 's di[MASK]ficulties recording the song , producer Brian Eno considered erasing the s[MASK]ng 's tapes to have them start from scratch . 
 " Where the Streets Have No Name " was praised by c[MASK]itics a[MASK]d became a commercial success , peaking at number thirteen in the US , number fourteen in [MASK]anada , number ten in the[MASK]Net[MASK]erlands , and number four in the United Kingdom . The song has remained a staple of their live act since the song debuted in 1987 on The Joshua Tree Tour . The song was[MASK]performed on a Los Angeles rooftop for the filming of its[MASK]music video , which won a Grammy Award for Best Performance Music Video . 
 
 = = Writing and recording = = 
 
 The music for " Where the Streets Have N[MASK] Name " originated from a demo that guitarist The Edge composed the night before the group resumed The Joshua Tree sessions . In[MASK]an upstairs room at Melbeach House — his newly purch[MASK]sed home — The Edge used[MASK]a[MASK]four @-@ track tape machine to reco[MASK]d an arrangement[MASK]of ke[MASK]boards , b[MASK]ss , gui[MASK]ar , and a drum machine[MASK]. Realising t[MASK]at the album sessions we[MASK]e approaching th[MASK] end and that the band wer[MASK] short on exceptional live son[MASK]s [MASK] The Edge wanted to " conjure up the ultimate U2 live @-@ song " , so he imagined what he would like to hear at a future U2 show if he were a fan . After finishing the rough mix , he felt he had come up with " the most amazing[MASK]guitar part and song of [ hi[MASK] ] life " . With no one in the house to share the d[MASK]mo[MASK]with , The E[MASK]ge recalls dancing around and punching the air in celebration . 
 Although the band liked the demo , it was difficult for them to record the song . Bassist Adam Clayton said [MASK] " At the time it sounded like a foreign language , whereas now we understand how it works " . The arrangement , w[MASK]th two time signatu[MASK]e shifts and frequent chord changes , w[MASK]s rehear[MASK]ed many times , but the group struggled to get a pe[MASK]formance they liked . According to co @-@ producer Daniel Lanois , " that was the science project song [MASK] I remember having this massive schoolhouse blackboard [MASK][MASK]as we call them . I was holding a poi[MASK]ter , like a college professor , walking the band through the chord changes like a fucking nerd . It wa[MASK] ri[MASK]iculous . " Co @-@ producer Brian Eno est[MASK]mates that half of the album sessions were spent tr[MASK][MASK]ng t[MASK] record a suitable version of " Where the Streets Have No Name " . The band[MASK]worked on a [MASK]ingle take for weeks , but as Eno explained , that particul[MASK]r ver[MASK]ion[MASK]had a lot of p[MASK]oblems wi[MASK]h it and the group cont[MASK]nued trying to [MASK]ix it up . Through [MASK]ll of their work , they had gradual[MASK]y replaced each instrument take until [MASK][MASK][MASK]hing remained from the original performance . 
 So much time had be[MASK]n spent on " screwdriver work " that Eno tho[MASK]ght it would be best to start fr[MASK]m scratch . His idea was to " stage an accident " and have the s[MASK]ng 's tapes erased . He said that this was [MASK]ot to force abando[MASK]ment of the song , but rather that it would be more effect[MASK]ve to start again with a fresh performance . At one point , Eno had the ta[MASK]es[MASK]cued up and re[MASK]dy [MASK]o be r[MASK]corded over , but this erasure never took place[MASK]; according to engineer Flood [MASK][MASK]fellow engineer Pat McCarthy returne[MASK] to the [MASK]ontrol room and upon seeing Eno ready to erase the[MASK]tapes , dropped the tray of tea he was carrying and physically restrained Eno . 
 The studio version of the[MASK]song was compiled [MASK]rom several different takes . It was one of several songs mixed by S[MASK]eve Lillywhite in the final months of recordin[MASK] [MASK]he Joshua Tree . Drummer Larry Mullen , Jr. later said of the song , " It took so long to get that s[MASK]ng righ[MASK] , it was difficult for us to make any[MASK]sense of it .[MASK]It only became a truly great song through playing live . On the record , mu[MASK]ically , it 's not half the song i[MASK] is live . " 
 
 = = Composition = = 
 
 " Where the Streets Have No Name " is played at a tempo of 126 beats per minute . The introduction and[MASK]outro are played in a 3 / 4 time signature , while the remainder of the song is in a common 4 / 4 sign[MASK]ture .[MASK][MASK]he songs opens with an instrumental section , starting with chorale[MASK]@-@ like sustained synthesiser notes [MASK] The guitar fades in after 42 seconds ; this part consists of a repeated " chiming " six @-@ note ar[MASK]eggio . A " dotted eighth " delay effect is used[MASK]to [MASK] play " each note in the arpeggio twice , thus creating a rich sound . The bass and drums enter at 1 : 10 . 
 The introduction , following a I – IV – I – IV – vi – V – I chord progression , creates a " wall of sound "[MASK], as desc[MASK]ibed[MASK]by Ma[MASK]k Butler , against which the vocals emerge after nearly two minutes . The guitar part played for the remainder [MASK]f t[MASK]e song features The Edge strumming percussive sixteenth notes . The bass and drums contin[MASK]e in regular eighth and sixteenth notes , respectively , while Bono 's vocal performance , in con[MASK]rast , varies greatly in its ti[MASK]bre , ( " he sighs ; he moans ; he grunts ; he exh[MASK]les audibly ; he allows his voice to [MASK]rack " ) as well as timing by his usage of r[MASK]bato to slightl[MASK][MASK]off[MASK]et the notes he sings from the beat [MASK] 
 This develo[MASK]ment reaches a climax during[MASK]the first chorus at the line " burning down love " ( A – G – F ♯ – D ) ; the melody progresses through a series of scale degrees that lead to the highest not[MASK] in[MASK]the song , the A4[MASK]at[MASK]" burning " . In later choruses , Bono sings " blown by the wind " with the[MASK]same melody , stretching the same note even longer . After the third chorus , the song 's outro is played , the instrumentat[MASK]on revert[MASK]ng to the same state as it was in the introduction , with a six @-@ n[MASK]te guitar arpeggio [MASK]layed against sustained synthesiser notes . 
 
 = = Lyrics = = 
 
 The lyrics were inspired by a story that Bono heard about the streets of Belf[MASK]st , Northern Ireland , [MASK]here a person 's reli[MASK]ion and income are evident by the street they live on . He contra[MASK]ted this with the anonymity he felt [MASK]hen visiting Ethiopia , saying[MASK]: " ... the g[MASK]y in[MASK]the song recognizes this contrast a[MASK]d thinks ab[MASK]ut [MASK] world where there aren 't such division[MASK] , a place where the streets have no name . To me , that 's the way a great rock ' n ' roll concert should be : a place where everyone [MASK]omes t[MASK]gether ... Maybe that 's the dream of all art : to break down the barriers and the divisions between people and touch upon the things that matter the most to us all . " Bono wr[MASK]te the lyrics while on a humanitarian v[MASK]si[MASK] [MASK]o Ethiopia with his wife , Ali Hewson ; he first wrote them down on an airsickness bag while staying in a village . 
 According to him , the song is ostensibly about " Transcendence , elevation , [MASK]hatever you want to call it . " Bono , w[MASK]o compared many of hi[MASK] lyric[MASK] prior to The Josh[MASK]a Tree to " sketches " , said that " '[MASK]Whe[MASK]e the Streets Have No Name ' is more like the U2 of old than a[MASK]y of the other songs[MASK]on the LP , because it 's a sketch — I was just trying to sketch [MASK] location , [MASK]aybe a spiritual location , maybe a roman[MASK]ic location . I was trying to sketch a fe[MASK]ling . " 
 The open @-@ en[MASK]ed nature of the lyrics has led to many interpretat[MASK]ons . Journalist Michael Campbell believed the lyrics send[MASK]" a message of hope " and wish for a " world that is not divided by c[MASK]ass , wealth , race , or any other arbitrary criterion " . With regard to the place Bono was referring to in the song , he said , " I 'm not sure , really , about that . I used to think it w[MASK]s Belfast ... " Journalist Niall Stokes believes the title was influenced by Bono 's and his wife Ali 's visit to Ethiopia as volunteer aid @-@ workers . Bono has expressed mixed opinions about the op[MASK]n @-@ ended lyric[MASK] : " I can look at it now and recognize that [ the song ] has one of the most banal couplets in the history of pop music . But it also contains some of the biggest ideas . In a curious way , that seems to work . If you get[MASK]any way heavy about these things , you don 't communicate . But if you 're flip or throwaway about it , [MASK]hen you do . That 's one of the paradox[MASK]s I 've come[MASK]to terms with . "

A backup generator was put on the[MASK]roof so the sho[MASK]ting could continue in th[MASK] event that the authorities shut off the power on the primary generator , which happened during filmin[MASK] . 
[MASK]The d[MASK]piction of the police[MASK]attempting to shut down the video shoot due to safe[MASK]y concerns actually happened during filming , just as seen in the video . Hamlyn was almost arrested following a confrontation with the police . According to Avis , the events depicted in the video show what actually happened that day " almost in r[MASK]al time " , [MASK]nd that " get[MASK]ing busted was an integral part of the plan . " Band manager Paul McGuinness revealed in 2007 that much of the confrontation with[MASK]the police w[MASK][MASK] exaggerated ; the [MASK]roup were hoping to get shut down by the authorities in order to dramatize the music video , but the police continually gave them extensions for shooting the video . In the backgrou[MASK]d of the video is a sign for The Million Dollar Hotel , which was rebuilt to create some interest , in case no one showed up at the[MASK]film shoot . Although the video is of a live performance , t[MASK]e audio used is from the studio @-@ r[MASK]corded version of the song[MASK]. The video won the Gram[MASK]y Award for Best Perf[MASK]r[MASK]ance Music Vid[MASK]o at the 1989 Grammy Awards .

 " Race Against Time " was released on the 12 @-@ inch[MASK], cassette , and CD versions [MASK]f the single . The song deve[MASK]op[MASK]d from the band 's interest [MASK]n urban funk[MASK], and was described by The Edge as " a kind of Afro @-@ rhythmic piece " and " a s[MASK]udy in rhythm . " The bass riff in the song , inspired by the bodhrán , was played by The[MASK]E[MASK][MASK]e , but stemmed fr[MASK]m some of Clayton 's unused bass p[MASK]rts . Mullen 's drum part was recorded in a single [MASK]ake . The song is primarily an instrumental piece but do[MASK]s contain some lyrics inspired by Bono 's trip to Ethiopia after Live Aid and his witnessing firsthand the famine in occurrence ; these lyrical references include Bono singing in an Ethiopian language and following it with the phrase " Race aga[MASK]nst time " . Bono said of the[MASK]song , " It r[MASK]minds me of the desert . The deser[MASK] is so empty[MASK], but it aches with a strange kind of fullness . " John Hutchinson of Musician magazine descri[MASK]ed the so[MASK]g as having an " African flavour " and as being reminiscent of Peter Gabriel . The track was used in the Miami Vice episode " Child 's Play "[MASK], and is [MASK]he only one of the single 's B @-@ si[MASK]es that was never[MASK]played live . 
 " Silver and Gold "[MASK]was written in support of the Artists United Against [MASK]pa[MASK]theid project , which protested the South African apartheid . In 1985 , Bono participated in Steven Van Zandt 's anti @-@ apartheid Sun City project and [MASK]pent time with Keith[MASK]Richards and Mick Jagger of The Rolling Stones . When Richa[MASK]ds and Jagge[MASK] played blu[MASK]s , Bono was embarrassed by his lack of familiarity with the genre , as most of U[MASK] 's musical know[MASK]edge began with[MASK]punk rock in their youth in th[MASK] mid @-@ 1970s . Bono realised that U2 " had no tradition " , and he felt as if they " were from outer space " . This inspired him to wr[MASK]te the blues @-@ influenced song " Silver and Gold " , which he recorded with Richards and Ronnie Wood . It was re @-@ recorded by U2 for the " Where the Streets Have No Name " single while the band [MASK]eturned to Dublin during in May 1[MASK]87 during a break between the first and second legs [MASK]f The Joshua Tree Tour .[MASK]The song was described by Musician as " tough and raw , with Bono in husky and confident voice , underpinne[MASK][MASK][MASK]y a sinuous bass line , and with The Edge demonstrating his newfound prowess in blues @-@ based guitar . " " Silver and Gold " was played live on The Joshua Tree Tour several times , one performance of which was featured on the band 's 1988 album and rockumentary , Rattle and Hu[MASK] . Both the stu[MASK]io recor[MASK]ing and the Sun City versions [MASK]ere [MASK]ater fea[MASK]ured on the bonus disc of the 20th anniversar[MASK] [MASK]dition of The Joshua Tree . The studio version was also included on the limited edition B @-@ sides bo[MASK]us disk of the band 's first compilati[MASK]n album , The Best of 1980 – 1990 . 
 " Sweetest Thing " was written by Bono as[MASK]an apology to his wife for forgetting h[MASK]r birthday . The s[MASK]ng opens with a [MASK]hort piano piec[MASK] befor[MASK] the rest of the band begins to play . Some of Bono [MASK]s lyr[MASK]cs have been descr[MASK]bed as reminiscent of John Lennon . The Edge descri[MASK]ed it as " a beautiful song ... which is pop as it should be — not produced out of existence , but pop produced with a real intimacy and purity " [MASK] also noting that[MASK]" It 's very new[MASK]for us . " It was re @-@ recorded with some lyrical alterations and released in 1998 as a single in its own right for The Best of 1980 – 1990 .[MASK]Hot Press editor Niall Stokes [MASK]tated that this track , along with " Race Against Time " , is " an indicat[MASK]r of what U2 might have made instead of The Joshua Tree . "

 Upon [MASK]he release of The Joshua Tree , critics praised " Where the Streets Have No Name " . Steve Morse of The Boston Globe noted the " bell @[MASK]@ like tones from the Edge fram [ [MASK] ] a search for heaven "[MASK]and along with the subsequent track on the album , " I Still Haven 't Fo[MASK][MASK]d What I 'm Looking For " , these songs showed how the group were " pilgrims still on a quest ; not preachers who claim to have found answers " . The Bergen Record echoed t[MASK]ese sentiments , saying the tracks demonstrated how the band wa[MASK] on a personal and spirit[MASK]al quest . Rolling Stone called it " as[MASK]ertive rock " i[MASK] their review of The Joshua Tree . The San Diego Union @-@ Tribune said o[MASK] " Where the Streets Have No Na[MASK]e [MASK] , " [MASK]he music ch[MASK]rges , like someone fleeing for life " . The Washingt[MASK]n Post said the track is " a bit oblique lyrically , but the imp[MASK]ica[MASK]ions are [MASK]lear in Bono 's re[MASK]olute delivery[MASK], Dave ( the Edge ) Evan 's quavering guitar , Adam Clay[MASK]on 's cathedral bass and Larry Mullen 's rolling thunder drums " . 
 NME lauded the song as the opening track by saying the album " starts by spitting furiously " . The publication praised Bono 's impassioned singing and The Edge 's guitar playing , which t[MASK]an[MASK]formed the instrument int[MASK] " something more than an endlessly abused piece of wood "[MASK]. The review comme[MASK]ted that th[MASK] " [MASK]ast t[MASK]n seconds are breathtakingly beautiful " . The Rocket wrote that the song builds a " wal[MASK] of sound " that Bono 's vocals[MASK]cut through with[MASK]a " wail[MASK]of desperatio[MASK] , as the lyrics ago[MASK]ize the need for personal spirituality " . The reviewer compared the opening riff to Simple Minds ' " Ghostdancing " . Reviewing The Joshua Tree , Stephen Thomas Erlewine of Allmusic called the song an[MASK]" epic opener " . The service 's Steve Huey , in a review of the song , prai[MASK]ed its " insistent , propulsive rhythmi[MASK] drive and anthemic chorus " [MASK] qualities he singled out for making it [MASK] fan favorite . He called the song the " perfect album @-@ opener " , crediting the " slow build of its arrangement toward a climactic pe[MASK]k " . Huey also called Bono 's delivery " passionate[MASK]and grandiose " and " his commitment to the material unshakable " . He believed the combination of his vocals and the band 's " sonic p[MASK]wer "[MASK]is what gav[MASK] U2 its " tremendous force " .

 " Where the Streets[MASK]Have No Name " made its concert debut on 2 April 1987 in Tempe , Arizona on the opening[MASK]night of[MASK]The Joshua Tree Tour . It has since been played at nearly every full @-@ length concert that U2 has headlined , total[MASK]ng over 700 performances as of 2011 . The so[MASK]g is widely regarded as one of the group 's most popular live songs . [MASK]o[MASK]o said of it , " We can [MASK]e in the middle of the worst gig in our lives , but when we go into that song , everything changes . The audience is on its feet , singing along with every word . It 's like God sud[MASK]enly wa[MASK]ks through the room . " 
 On The Joshua Tree Tour , " Where the Streets Have No Name " was most often used to open concerts . Fans and critics [MASK]esponded favourably t[MASK] the song in a live setting . The San Diego Union @-@ Tribune wrote that , " From the lof[MASK]y sonic opening strains of [ the song ] , [MASK]his audience was up , ecstatic and infla[MASK]ed . " NME wrote that the song is one such[MASK]occasion where " the power afforded their songs is s[MASK]ary " , noting that during the song 's opening , " the arena [MASK]RUPTS " . In other reviews , the song was ca[MASK]led : " uplifting " , " exhilarating " , and " powerful " . Out[MASK]of the 109 shows during Th[MASK] Joshua Tree Tour , " Streets " was played at all except 12 of the concerts . During the Lovetown Tour which took place in 1989 and the beginning of 1990 , " Streets " was only left out of the set list at one of the 47 concerts . 
 The song was performed at every show on the 1992 – 1993 Zoo TV Tour . Co[MASK]certs from this tour were elaborate multimedia spectacles that Bono performed as a variety of characters , but f[MASK]r the end of the main set , the group reverted to playing classics , including " Whe[MASK]e the Streets Have No Name " , straight . S[MASK]me of these performances of the song were accompanied by footage of the group in the desert from The Joshua Tree 's photo shoot[MASK][MASK] The[MASK]video was speed[MASK]d up for humorous effect — NME described the effect as giving it a " si[MASK]ly , Charlie Chaplin quality " — and Bono often acknowledged his young[MASK]r self on the video screens . This video would make a return du[MASK]ing performances on the 2010 and 2011 legs of the U2 360 ° Tour . Some of the Zoo TV performances of the song had a more electronic dance music arrangement that bore a r[MASK]semblance to the Pet Sh[MASK]p Boys ' synthpop cover of the song ( titled " Where the Streets Have No Name ( I [MASK]an 't Take My Eyes off You ) " ) . Bono parodied this by occasionally adopting the deadpan vocal style used in the Pet Shop Boys ' co[MASK]er . Critics welcomed the song in the group 's setlist : The Independent sai[MASK] the song " induces instant eup[MASK]or[MASK]a , as U2 do what they 're best at , slipping into epic rock mode , playing music made for the arena " . In tw[MASK] other local newspaper reviews , critics praised the song 's inclusion in a sequence of greatest hits . 
 For the P[MASK]pMart Tour of 1997 – 1998 ,[MASK][MASK]2 returned to the electronic dance arrangement they occasionally played on the Zoo TV Tour . The set 's massive video screen[MASK]displaye[MASK] a video that Hot[MASK]Press described as an " astonishing , 2001 @-@ style trip into[MASK]the heart of a swirling , psychedelic tunnel that suc[MASK]s the audience in towards a horizonta[MASK] monolith " . Near the end of the song , peace doves w[MASK]re shown on the screen a[MASK]d bright beams of light flanking the set 's golden arch were projected upwards . Hot Press said [MASK]he effect transfor[MASK]ed the stadi[MASK]m into a " UFO[MASK]landing[MASK]site " . 
 Shortly before the third leg of the Elevation Tour , the September 11 attacks occurred in New Y[MASK]rk City and Washington D.C. During the band 's first show in[MASK]New York[MASK]Ci[MASK]y following the attacks , the band performe[MASK] " Where the Streets Have No Name " , an[MASK] when the stage lights illuminated the audience , th[MASK] band saw [MASK]ears st[MASK]eaming down the faces of m[MASK]ny fans . The experience was one inspiration for the song " City of Blinding Lights " . The [MASK]and paid tribute to the 9 / 11 victims during their performance of the song[MASK]at the Supe[MASK] Bowl XXXVI [MASK]alftime show on 3 February 2002 . The performance featured the names of the September 11 victims projected onto a large white banner behind the band . U2 's appeara[MASK]ce was later ranked number 1 on Sports Illustrated 's list of " Top 10 Super [MASK]owl Halftime Shows " . 
 For the Vertigo Tou[MASK] , the group originally considered dropping the song from their setlists , but Mullen and Clayton successfully ar[MASK]ued against th[MASK]s . All 131 of the Vertigo Tour concerts featured a[MASK]performance of the song , which were accompanied by the stag[MASK] 's LED video curtains displaying African flags . On the tour 's ope[MASK]ing[MASK]night , this reminded Bono that he ha[MASK] originally written the lyrics in an Ethiopian village . He thought this visual accompaniment made the son[MASK] come full circle , saying [MASK] " And here it was , nearly twenty years later , coming back to Africa , all the stuff about parched lands and deserts making sense for the first time . " The song was also played at the preview screening of the band 's c[MASK]ncert film U2 3D at the 2007 Cannes Film Festival[MASK]. At the Glastonbury Festival 2010 , The Ed[MASK]e [MASK]ccompanied rock band Muse for a live cover version of the track , later playing it with U2 [MASK]hile headlining Glastonbury in 2011 . 
 Live performances of " Where the Streets Have[MASK]No Name " appear in the concert video releases Rattle and Hum , Zoo TV : Live from Sydney , and PopMart : Live from Mexico City , as well as the respective a[MASK]dio releases of the [MASK]atter two concerts , Zoo TV Live[MASK]and Hasta la Vista Baby ! U2 Live from Mexico City . A second version from th[MASK] PopMart Tour was featured on Please : PopHeart Live EP , and later on the U.S. " P[MASK]ease " single . A live recording from Boston during the Elevation Tour was featured i[MASK] the concert film Elevation 2001 : Liv[MASK][MASK]from Boston , and o[MASK] the " Walk On " and " Electrical [MASK]torm " singles . The concert video and album U2 Go Home : Live fr[MASK]m Slane Castle , Ireland featured another performance from the Elevation Tour , and later performances were featur[MASK]d in the concert films Vertigo 2005 : Live from Chicago a[MASK]d U2 3D ( Vertigo Tour ) , and U2 360 ° at the Rose Bowl ( U2 360 ° Tour ) . The 2004[MASK]digital album , Live from the Point Depot , contains a performance from the Lovetown Tour[MASK], only available as part of The Complete U2 digital box set .

 = Nazarov c[MASK]clization rea[MASK]tion = 
 
 The Nazarov cyclization reaction ( often referred to as simply the Nazarov cyclization ) is a chemical reaction used[MASK]in organic chemistry for the [MASK][MASK]nthesis of cyclopentenones[MASK]. The reaction[MASK]is typically divided into classical and modern variants , depending on the reagents and substrates employed .[MASK]It was o[MASK]i[MASK]inally discovered by Ivan Nikolaev[MASK]ch Nazar[MASK]v ( 1906 – 1957[MASK]) in 1941 while study[MASK]ng the rea[MASK]rangements of al[MASK]yl vin[MASK]l ketones . 
 As originally des[MASK]ribed , the Nazarov cyclization involves [MASK]he activation of a divinyl ketone using a stoichiometric Lewis acid or protic ac[MASK]d promoter .[MASK]The key st[MASK]p of the reaction mechanism involves a cationic 4π @-@ electrocyclic r[MASK]ng closure which forms the cyclopen[MASK]enone product ( See Mechanism below[MASK]) . As the reaction has been deve[MASK]oped , variants i[MASK]volving substrates other than divinyl [MASK]etones and promoters other than Lewis acids have been subsumed under the name Nazarov cyclization provided that they follow a similar m[MASK]chanistic pathwa[MASK] . 
 The success of the Nazarov cyclization as a tool in organic synth[MASK]sis stems from the utility and ubiquity of cyclopentenones as both motifs in natural products ( including[MASK]jasmone , the aflatoxins , and a sub[MASK]lass of prostaglandins ) and as useful synthetic intermediates for total [MASK]ynthesis . The re[MASK]ction has[MASK]been used in several total syntheses and several revie[MASK]s ha[MASK]e been published . 
 
 = =[MASK]Mechanism = = 
 
 The mechanism of the classical Nazarov cyclization reaction was first demonstrated experimentally by Shoppe to be an intramolecular electrocycliza[MASK]ion and is outline[MASK] below . Activation of the ketone by the acid catalyst generates a pentadienyl cat[MASK]on which undergoes a thermally al[MASK]owed 4π conrotatory electrocyclizatio[MASK] as dictated by the Woodward @-@ Hoffman rules . This generates an oxyallyl cation which undergoes an elimination reaction to lose a β @-@ hydrogen .[MASK]Subsequent tautomeriza[MASK]ion of the enolate produces the cyclopentenone prod[MASK]ct . 
 [MASK]s noted above [MASK] variant[MASK] t[MASK]at deviate from [MASK]his template are known ; what designates a Nazarov cyclization in particular is the g[MASK]nerat[MASK]on of the pentadienyl cation followed by [MASK]lectrocyclic ring closure to an oxyallyl cation . In order to achieve this transformation , the molecule must be in the s @-@[MASK]trans /[MASK]s @-@ trans conformation , placing the vinyl groups in an appropriate orientation . The prop[MASK]nsity of the [MASK]ystem to enter this conformation dramatically influences reaction rate , with α @-@ substituted substrates having an increased population of the requisite conform[MASK]r due to allylic strain . Coordin[MASK]tion of an electron donatin[MASK] α @-@ substituent by the catalyst can likewise increase the react[MASK]on rate by enforcing th[MASK]s conformatio[MASK] . 
 Similarly , β [MASK]-@ substitution directed inward restricts the s @-@ trans conformation so severely that E @-@ Z isomeri[MASK][MASK]tion has been shown to occur in adva[MASK]ce of cycliza[MASK]ion on a wide range of substrates , yielding the trans cyclopentenone regardless of initial config[MASK]ration . In this way , the Nazarov cyclization is a rare example of a stereo[MASK]elective pericyclic reaction , whereas[MASK]most electrocyclizations are stereospe[MASK]ific . The example bel[MASK]w[MASK]uses triethylsilyl hydride to [MASK]rap the oxyallyl cation so [MASK]hat [MASK]o elimination occurs . ( See Int[MASK]rrupted cyclizations below ) 
 Along this same vein , allenyl vinyl ketones of the type studied extensively by Marcus Tius of the University of Hawaii sho[MASK] dramatic rate acceleration due to the remov[MASK]l of β [MASK]-@ hydrogens , obviating a large amount of steric strain in the s @-@ cis conformer . 
 
[MASK]= = Classical Nazarov cyclizations = = 
 
 Though cyclizatio[MASK]s[MASK]following the general templat[MASK] above had [MASK]een observed prior to Nazarov '[MASK] involvement , it was his[MASK]s[MASK]ud[MASK] of the rearrangements of allyl vinyl [MASK]etones that [MASK]arked the first major examination of this process . Nazarov correctly reasoned that the allylic olefin isomerized in situ to form a divinyl ketone before ring closure to the cyclopen[MASK]enone product . The rea[MASK]tion shown below involves an alkyne oxyme[MASK]curation reaction to generate the requisite[MASK]ke[MASK]one . 
 [MASK]esearch involving the reaction[MASK]was relatively quiet in subsequent years , until in the mid @-@ 1980s when several synthes[MASK]s employing the Nazarov cyc[MASK]ization were published . Shown below are key steps in the syntheses of [MASK]richodiene and Nor [MASK]-@ Sterepolide[MASK], the latter of which is thought to proceed via an unusual alkyne @-@ allene isomerization that generates the divinyl ketone . 
 
 = = = Shortcomings = = = 
 
 The cl[MASK]ssical version of the Nazarov cyclization suffers from several drawbacks which modern var[MASK]ants attempt to circumvent . The first two are not e[MASK]ident from the mechanism alone , but are indicative[MASK]of the barriers to cyclization ; the last three stem from sele[MASK]tivity issues relating to elimination and protonation of the interm[MASK]diate .[MASK]
 Strong Lewis or protic acids are typically required for the reaction ( e.g. TiCl4[MASK], B[MASK]3 , MeSO3H ) . These promoters are not compatible with sensitive functional groups , limiting the substrate scop[MASK] . 
 Despite the mechanistic possibility [MASK]or catalys[MASK]s , multi[MASK]le equiva[MASK]ents [MASK]f the promoter are often required in order to effect th[MASK][MASK]reaction . This limits the atom[MASK]economy of the reaction . 
 The elimination step is not regioselective ; if multiple β @-@ hydrogens are av[MASK]ilable for eli[MASK]ination , various products a[MASK]e often observed as mixtures . This is highly undesirable from an efficiency standpoint as [MASK]rduous separation [MASK]s typically required . 
 Elimination destroys a potential stereocenter , decreasing the potentia[MASK] usefulness of the reaction . 
 Protonation of the enolate is sometimes not stereoselective , meaning [MASK]hat products can b[MASK] formed as mixtures of epimers . 
 
 = = Modern variants = = 
 
 The shortcomings noted above limit[MASK]the usefulness of the Nazarov cyclization reaction in its canonical form . However , modifications to the reaction f[MASK]cused on remedying its issues continue to be an ac[MASK]ive area of academic research . In particular , the research has focused o[MASK][MASK]a few key areas : rendering the reaction catalyti[MASK] in the promoter , effecti[MASK]g the[MASK]reaction with more mild promoters to improve functional group tolerance , directing the regioselectivity of the elimination step , and improving the overal[MASK] stereoselectivity . These have been suc[MASK]essful to varying degrees . 
 Additionally , modifications focused on altering the progress of the reaction , either by generating the pentadienyl cati[MASK]n in an unorthodox fashion or by having the oxya[MASK]lyl cation " intercepted " in various ways . Furthermore , enantioselecti[MASK]e variants of various kin[MASK]s h[MASK]ve been developed . The sheer volume of literature on the subject prevents a comprehensive examination of this [MASK]ield ; key examples are given below .[MASK]
 
 = = = Silicon @-@ direct[MASK]d cyclization = = = 
 
 T[MASK]e earliest efforts to improve the se[MASK]ectivity of the Nazarov cyclization took advantage of the β @-@ silicon effect in order to dire[MASK]t the regioselectivity of the elimination step . This [MASK]hemistry was developed most extensively[MASK]b[MASK] Professor Scott Denmark of the University of Illinois , Urbana @-@ Champ[MASK]ign in the mid @-@ 1[MASK]80s and u[MASK]ilizes stoichiometric [MASK]mounts of iron trichloride to promote the [MASK]eact[MASK]on . W[MASK]th bicyclic produc[MASK]s , the cis isomer was selected for to varying [MASK]egrees . 
 The silicon @-@ directed Nazarov cyclization reaction was subsequen[MASK]ly empl[MASK]yed in the synthesis of the natural pr[MASK]duct Silphinene [MASK] shown below . The cyclization t[MASK]kes place before e[MASK]imination of the benzyl alcohol moiety , so that the resulting stereochemistry of the newly formed ring a[MASK]ises from approac[MASK][MASK]of the silyl alk[MASK]ne anti to the ether . 
 
 = = = Polarization = = = 
 
 Draw[MASK]ng on [MASK]he substituent effects compiled over various trials of the reaction , Professor Alison Frontier of the Univers[MASK]ty of Rochester developed [MASK] paradigm for " polarized " Nazarov cyclizations in which electron donating and electron withdrawing groups are used to improve the overall selectivity of the reaction[MASK]. Creation of an effective vinyl nucleophile and vinyl [MASK]lectrophile in the substrate al[MASK]ows catalytic activation with copper triflate and regioselective elimi[MASK]a[MASK]ion[MASK]. In addition , the electron withdrawing group increases the acidity of the α @[MASK]@ proton , allowing[MASK]selective formation of th[MASK] trans @[MASK]@ α @-@ epimer via equilibration . 
 It is often possi[MASK]le to achieve catalytic activation us[MASK]ng a donating[MASK]or withdraw[MASK]ng group alone , although the efficiency of the reaction ( yield , reaction time , etc . ) is typically lower . 
 
[MASK]= = = Alternative cati[MASK]n generation = = = 
 
 By exten[MASK]ion , any pentadienyl cation regardles[MASK] of its origin is capable of undergoing a Nazarov cyclization . There have [MASK]een a large number of e[MASK]amples published w[MASK]ere the requisite cation is arrived at by a variety of rearrangements . One such example involves th[MASK] silver catalyzed ca[MASK]ionic ring opening of allylic d[MASK]chloro cylopropanes . The silver salt facilitate[MASK] lo[MASK]s of chloride via precipitation of insoluble silver chloride . 
 In the total synthesis of rocaglamide , epoxidation of a vinyl alkoxyallenyl stann[MASK]ne likewise generates [MASK] pentadienyl cation via ring opening of the resultant epoxide . 
 
 = = = Interru[MASK]ted cyclization = = = 
 
 Once the cyclization has occurred , an oxyallyl cation is formed [MASK] As discussed extensively above , the typica[MASK] course for this intermediate is elimination followed by enolate tautomerization . Howev[MASK]r , these two steps can be interrupted by various [MASK]ucleophiles and electrophiles , respectively . Oxyallyl cati[MASK]n trapping has been developed extensively by Fredrick G.[MASK]West of the University of Alber[MASK]a and his review covers the field . The oxyallyl cation can be trapped with heteroatom and carbon nucleophiles and can also undergo cationic cycloadditions with various te[MASK]hered partners . Shown below is a cascade reaction in which successive cation tra[MASK]ping g[MASK]nerates a pentacyclic core in one step with complete diastereoselectivity . 
 Enolate trapping w[MASK]th various electrophiles is decidedly less [MASK]ommon . In on[MASK] study , the Nazarov cyclization is paired with a Michael r[MASK]action using an iridi[MASK]m ca[MASK]alyst[MASK]to initia[MASK]e nucleophilic conjugate addition of the enolate to β @-@ [MASK]itrostyrene . In this tandem[MASK]reaction the[MASK]iridium catalyst is required for both conversions : it acts as the Lewis acid [MASK]n the Nazarov cyclization and in the next step the nit[MASK]o group [MASK]f nitrostyrene first [MASK]oordinates to iridium in a ligand exchange with the carbonyl ester oxygen atom before the actual Michael addition takes place to the opposite [MASK]ace of the R @-@ group . 
 
 = = = Enantioselective variants = = [MASK] 
 
 The development of an enantioselecti[MASK]e Nazarov cyclization is a desirable addition to the repe[MASK]toire of Nazarov cyc[MASK]ization reactions . To that end , several[MASK]variations have b[MASK]en developed utilizing chiral auxiliaries and chiral catalysts . Diastereoselective cyclizations are also known , in which extant ste[MASK]eocenters direct the [MASK]yclization . Almost all of the attemp[MASK]s are based on the idea o[MASK] torquoselectivity ; selecting one direction for the vinyl groups to " rotate " in turn sets [MASK]he stereochemistry as shown below . 
 Silicon @-@ directed Nazarov cyclizations can exhibit induced dias[MASK]ereoselectiv[MASK]ty in this way . In the example below , the silyl @-@ group acts to d[MASK]rect the cyclization by preventing the distant alkene from rotating " towards " it via unfavorabl[MASK][MASK]steric interaction . In this way the[MASK]silicon acts as a traceless auxiliary [MASK] ( The starting material is not e[MASK]antiopure but the retention of enantiomeric excess s[MASK]ggests that the auxiliary dire[MASK]ts the cyclization . ) 
 Tius 's allenyl substrates can exhibit axial to tetr[MASK]hedral chirality transfer if enantiopure allenes are used . The example below genera[MASK]es a chiral diosphenpol in 64 % yield an[MASK] 95 % enantiomeric excess .

 The first chiral Lew[MASK]s acid promoted asymmetric Nazarov cyclization was reported by Varinder Aggarwal and utilized copper ( II ) bisoxazoline ligand complexes with up to 98 % ee . The enantiomeric excess was [MASK]naffected by use o[MASK] 50 mol % of the copp[MASK]r compl[MASK]x but the yi[MASK]ld was s[MASK]gnificantly decreased .

Harken discovers Bobby 's cellphone in his be[MASK]room and uses it to find his address , suspecting his wife Rhonda ( Julie Bowen ) is having an affair .[MASK]He drives over and kills Bobby , with Nick as a secret witness . 
 Nick flees at high speed , setting off a traffic camera . The trio meet to discuss their reservations about continuing with their plan . They are arrested by the police , who believe the camera footage makes them suspects in Bobby 's murder . Lacking evidence , the police are forced to[MASK]let the trio go f[MASK]ee . The trio consult with Jones again , but learn that he never actually killed anyone , h[MASK]ving been imprisoned for[MASK]bootlegging the film Snow Falling o[MASK] Cedars . Jones suggests that they get Harken to co[MASK]fess and secretly tape it . The three accidentally crash Harken 's surprise birthday party , where Nick and Dale get Harken to confess to the murder[MASK]before realizing that Kurt , who has the a[MASK]dio recorder , is else[MASK]here having sex with Rhonda . Harken threate[MASK]s to kill all three for attempting to blackmail him . They flee by car , but Harken gives[MASK]chase and repeatedly rams their vehicle .

 = = = Design = = = 
 
 Produ[MASK]tion designe[MASK] Shepherd Fr[MASK]nkel specifically set out to create distinctly different environments for the three employees and their respective bosses ' homes and offices . Nick and Harken 's workplace is [MASK]he " Comnidyne " bullpen , which was designed to " enhance the discomfort an[MASK] anxiety of lower @-@ level employees clustered in the center of the room where every movement is m[MASK]nitored by the boss from his corner office[MASK]. " The design team[MASK]met with financial strategists and management companies to learn about the architecture of their office layouts to visually represent the experience of starting from a low @-@ r[MASK]nking po[MASK]ition in a cubicle and aspiring to[MASK]an o[MASK][MASK]ice . Costume designer Carol Ramsey worked with Frankel and set decorator Jan Pascale to match Harken 's suit to that of th[MASK] surrounding " cold grey and blue " colo[MASK] palette of his office[MASK]. Harken 's home was d[MASK]scribed as " equally lackin[MASK] in warmth " as the office but more lavishly decorated and " for show " , including an intentionally oversized portrait of him with his " trophy wife " . 
 De[MASK]igning Julia 's office was descr[MASK]bed as a [MASK] challenge " , i[MASK]fusing a " sensual vibe " into a denta[MASK] office . Frankel approached the design through Julia 's mentality , stating , " She 's a Type A pro[MASK]essional at the top of her game [MASK] who likes to play cat @-@ and @-@ mous[MASK] , so it 's a completely controlled environment , with [MASK]pertures and views into other rooms so she alway[MASK] knows what 's g[MASK]ing on " . " It 's highly designed , with rich wallpaper and tones , sumptuous artwork and subtle lighting — all very disarming till you step into her private office . The blinds close , the door lock[MASK] and you[MASK]think , ' It [MASK]s the Temple of Doo[MASK] . ' " Similarly[MASK]approaching the character 's home , the design allowed for wide windows which face onto a public st[MASK]eet " which afford [MASK]er the[MASK]opportunity to put on the kind of show she cou[MASK]dn 't get away with at work . " 
 Bobby 's environme[MASK]ts were designed with more[MASK]contrast , the characte[MASK] being new to the[MASK]work area . Frankel described the contrast as " the [MASK]ompany reflects [ Jack Pellitt 's ] human touch , whereas [MASK] Bobby Pellitt [MASK]s ] home is a shameless shrine to himself and his hedonistic [MASK]ppetites . " Frankel continued , " It[MASK]featu[MASK]es a mishmash of anything he finds exotic and er[MASK]tic , mostly Egyptian and Asian motifs with an ' 80s Studio 54 vi[MASK]e , a makeshift dojo , lots of mirrors and a massage table . " Some parts of the house design were provided by Farrell and Gordon 's interpretation of the character[MASK]and his " infatuation " with martial arts and " his delusions of prowess " .

 Filming of Horrible Bosses took place in an[MASK] around Los Angeles . The product[MASK]on [MASK]eam attempted to find locations " that people haven '[MASK] already seen a hundred times in movies and on TV " , aimi[MASK]g fo[MASK] the film to appear as if it could be taking place anywhere in America " where people are trying to pursue the [MASK][MASK]er[MASK]can dream but getting stopped by a horrible boss . " " Comnidyine " [MASK]as r[MASK]presented by an office building[MASK]in Torrance , California , with the crew building[MASK]the set on a vacant floor[MASK]. For " Pellitt Chem[MASK]cal " , the production team found[MASK]a " perfect landscap[MASK] of pipes and containers " in Santa Fe Springs , surrounding an unoccupied water clea[MASK]ing and storage facility . To take advanta[MASK]e of the[MASK]surrounding imagery , the warehouse required an extens[MASK]ve series of overhauls , including cutting windows into concrete [MASK]alls and cre[MASK]ti[MASK]g new doorwa[MASK]s to allow for [MASK]isuals of the warehouse [MASK][MASK]terior and provide a settin[MASK] for the final scene of Sutherla[MASK]d 's character . A T.G.I.

 The film was shot digitally using the Panavision Ge[MASK]esis camera . Gordon encouraged the actors to improvise , thoug[MASK] Aniston claimed to not have taken advantage of the offer as much as her co @-@ stars , stating , " My dialogue was[MASK]just so beautifully choreographed that there wasn ’ t much that I needed to do ” .

 The soundtrack was composed by award @-@ winning composer Christopher Lennertz , with music contributed by Mike McCready of Pearl Jam , [MASK]tefan Lessard of Dave Matthews Band and Money Mar[MASK] — a collaborator with the [MASK]east[MASK]e Boys . McCready , Lessard , and Mark worked with musicians Matt Chamberlain , David Levita , Aaron Kaplan , Victor Indrizzo , Chris Chaney , Davey Chegwidden and DJ Cheapshot to develop the music . Major contributions were provi[MASK]ed by Mark on keyboard , McCready and Levita on guitar , Chaney and [MASK]essard on bass , Indrizzo on drums and DJ Cheapshot on t[MASK]rntables . 
 Lennertz recorded the soundtrack at The Village recording studio in West Los Angeles and C[MASK]pitol Records . Lenn[MASK]rtz attempted to remain " authentic " to the characters ' progression from av[MASK]rage worker to calculated killer . To achieve this aim , he decided against recording digitally , instead recording the tracks on two @-@ inch analog tape , intending each musica[MASK] cue to sound as if it was emanating from a vinyl record . He explained , " The idea was to put together a band that would record the score together the same way that they[MASK]would make an alb[MASK]m . It isn 't over @-@ produced or shiny and digital in any way . It 's[MASK]brash , nois[MASK] , and full of bravado and swagger . I knew that if we could harness some of this sonic magic i[MASK] the score , then the toughness and [MASK]onf[MASK]dence of the music would play against Bateman , Sudeik[MASK]s , and Charlie Day to really emphasize and elevate the humor in the situations tha[MASK] transpire . " Lennertz continued , " We tracked through tape before Pro Tools to get that fat sound , and made every ch[MASK]ice based on feel rather than perfection . We even used the same Wurlitzer that Money Mark play[MASK]d on Beck 's classic ‘ Where I[MASK] 's At ’ . At the end of the day , Seth [ Gordon ] and I wanted to produce a score that is [MASK]s irreverent and full of attitude as the movie itself . I think we did it ... and most of all , everyone had [MASK] blast in the process . "

The site 's critical consensus reads , " It 's nasty , uneven , and far from original , but thanks to a smartly assembled cast that [MASK]akes the most of a solid premise , Horrible Bosses works . " Review aggregate Metacriti[MASK] gave the film a score of 57 out of 100 , based on 40 critics , indicating " mixed or average reviews " . 
 Roger Ebert gave [MASK]he film three[MASK]and a half stars out of four , calling it " well @-@ cast " and commending it for playing to each actor 's strengths . Ebert gave particular praise to Spacey , labeling him " superb " , and Aniston ,[MASK]judging her performance to be a " surprise " and a return to form , stating " she has acute comic timing and hilariously[MASK]enacts alarming sexual hungers " . Ebert called Horrible Bosses " cheerful and wicked " . Lisa S[MASK]hwarzbaum of Enter[MASK]ainment Weekly reacted positively , calling the film " a bouncy , well @-@ built , delightfully nasty tale of resentment , desp[MASK]ration , and amoral revenge " and complimented the casting of the protagonists and antagonists . The A.V.

" Rabin singled out Day 's performance as " a potent illustration of how a brilliant character actor with a[MASK]spark of madness can elevate a ramshackle lowbrow farce into a solid mainstream comedy[MASK][MASK]hrough sheer fo[MASK]ce of charisma . " Edward Douglas of ComingSoon.net credited director Seth Gordon with h[MASK]ving assembled " the perf[MASK]ct cast " , claim[MASK]ng " the six leads kill in every scene [MASK] , but echoed Nathan Rabin 's sentiments that Da[MASK] is the " real stan[MASK]out " . Douglas summarize[MASK] the picture as " dark fun that works better t[MASK]an expected due to a well @-@ deve[MASK]oped script , an impeccable cast and a director who knows how to put t[MASK]e two together " . A. O.

[MASK]he review c[MASK]ncluded that " in the ways that count and ev[MASK]n when it shouldn[MASK]’ t , Horrible Bosses works .

Maltin concluded " the movie has just enough raunchiness to identify it as a 2011 comedy , just e[MASK]ough cleverness to admire , and just the right camaraderie [MASK]mong its three male stars , which turns out to be the movie ’ [MASK] greatest strength . " Rolling Stone 's Pet[MASK]r Travers gav[MASK] kudos to the " killer cast " , with s[MASK]ecific credit gi[MASK]en to Bateman and Day , but was critical of the movie , statin[MASK] " it wussies out on a sharp pre[MASK]ise " an[MASK] that it is a " hit @-@ and @-@ [MASK]iss farce that leaves you wishing i[MASK] was funnier than it is[MASK]" The Guardian 's Philip French called Horrible Bosses " [MASK] lumberi[MASK][MASK] , misogynistic affair " , but admitted " I laughed frequently , probably to the detriment of my[MASK]self @-@ respect . " Nicholas Barber of The Independent gave a positive review , complimenting Gordon for not allowing the actors ' i[MASK]provisation to be detrimental to the pacing , b[MASK]t felt the movie was not as " dar[MASK] " as its premise required , saying "[MASK]what edginess the film does h[MASK]ve comes[MASK]instead from the inordinate quantity of swearing , plu[MASK] a smattering of homophobia a[MASK]d misogyny .

 Salon 's Andrew O 'Hehir offered a mixed response , characterizing the film as[MASK]a " lot funnier in theory tha[MASK] in [MASK]ract[MASK]ce , but it won 't ruin you[MASK] Saturday night " .

The Hollywood Reporter 's Kirk Honeycut[MASK] responded negatively , stating the jokes failed to be funny , stating " Seth Gordon shows no flair for[MASK]turning the absurdities and cartoonish characters in the script ... into anything m[MASK]re than a collection of moments in search of laughs . " Karina Longworth of The Village Voice was critical of[MASK]the premise , which she felt lacked any [MASK]egitimate " rage [MASK] ag[MASK]inst the characters ' bosses , stating " ... there 's every sign that , even without these particular emasculators , Dale , Kurt [MASK]nd Nick would still be — for lack of a better word — total pussies .

She [MASK]articularly criticized the all @-@ white , male protagonists and a plo[MASK] she deemed racist and f[MASK]lled with [MASK] stereotypes " . Justin Chang o[MASK] Variety praised the performance of the ensemble cast , but considered the plot to be " predicta[MASK]ly moronic , vulgar and juvenile " .

 The 1985 Rajneeshee ass[MASK]ssination plot was[MASK]a conspiracy by a group of high @-@ ranking followers of Bhagwan Shree Rajneesh ( later known as Osho ) to [MASK]ssassinate Charl[MASK]s Turner , the then @-@ Un[MASK]ted States Attorney for the District of Oregon . Rajneesh 's persona[MASK] secretary and second @-@ in @-@ command , Ma Anand Sheela[MASK]( Sheela Silverman ) , assembled the group after Turner was appointed to investigate il[MASK]egal a[MASK]tivity at Rajneeshpuram . Turner investigated charges of immigration fraud and sham marriages , [MASK]nd later headed the federal prosecu[MASK]ion of the 1984 Rajneeshee bioterror attack in The Dalles , Oregon . 
 The conspirators included : Ma Anand Sheel[MASK] , Sally @-@ Anne Croft , Chief Financial Officer of [MASK]ajneeshpuram ; Susan Hagan , head of security at Rajneeshpuram , Catherine Jane Stork , who bought weapons and silencers and volunteered to be [MASK]he actual murderer ; Ann Phyllis McCarthy , fourth @-@ in @-@ command of Rajneeshpuram ; a[MASK]d co @-@ conspirators Alma Potter [MASK] Carol Matthews , Phyllis Caldwell and Ri[MASK]hard Kevin Langford . The conspirat[MASK]rs obtained false identification to purchase handguns out @-@ [MASK]f @-@ state ,[MASK]stalked Turner , and [MASK]lanned to m[MASK]rder him near his workplace in Portland , Oregon . The assassination plo[MASK] was never carried out and was only discovered later , as a[MASK]result of the investigation by federal law enforcement into the bioterror attack in The Dalles and other illegal acts by the Rajneeshpuram leadership . 
 Prosecution [MASK]f the conspirators began in 1990 , when a federal grand jury brought indictments against several of the key players . Some had [MASK]led [MASK]he country , and ext[MASK]adit[MASK]on proceedings against the perpetrators and subsequ[MASK]nt prosecution and [MASK]onviction was not completed for sixt[MASK]en years . The final conspirator w[MASK]s convicte[MASK] in 2006 , when Catherine Jane Stork agreed to r[MASK]turn to the United States from Germany in order to[MASK]be allowed to visit her ill son in Australia . Eight perpetrators r[MASK]ceived sentences ranging from five years probation to five years in fed[MASK]ral prison and an additional member of the Rajneesh commune pleaded g[MASK]ilty to murder conspiracy . Rajneesh was never prose[MASK][MASK]ted in relati[MASK]n to the conspiracy , [MASK]nd left the United States after ple[MASK]ding guilty to [MASK]mmigration frau[MASK] and agreeing not to reenter the country without permission from the U.S. Attorney General .

 Seven follo[MASK]ers ( called Rajneeshees ) of charismatic leader Bhagwan Shree Rajneesh ( now known as Osho ) , were convicted of a 1985 conspiracy to assassinate Charles Turne[MASK] , and an additional [MASK]nindicted eighth member of the[MASK]Ra[MASK]neesh commune pleaded guilty to murder conspira[MASK]y . The perpetrators were high @-@ ranking followers within the Rajneeshee organization . Prosecutors in the case stated that the perp[MASK]trators had planned to murder Turner after he was appointed to head an inve[MASK]tigation into the group 's activities in Rajneeshpuram , Oregon . Turner 's investigation foc[MASK]sed on sham marriages organized by the group , as well as ot[MASK]er illegal activities including immigration fraud , a[MASK]d he later head[MASK]d the federal prosecution relating to the 1984 Rajneeshee bioterror attack in The D[MASK]lles , [MASK]reg[MASK]n . Oregon Attorney [MASK]eneral Dave Frohn[MASK]ayer was also involve[MASK] in investigations of the group , working alongside Turner . 
 In May 1985 , Rajneesh 's persona[MASK] secretary and second @-@ in @-@ command , Sheela Silverman ( Ma Anand Shee[MASK]a ) , gathered the leader 's key followers and formed a group of conspirators in order to plan the assassination of[MASK]Turner , as well a[MASK] several dissidents among their organization . [MASK]heela stated that Turner 's grand jury investigation " threa[MASK]ened the existence of the commune " , and exposed Rajneesh and several of his disci[MASK]les to criminal p[MASK]osecution . Sheela hoped that [MASK]y murderin[MASK] Turner they would be able to thwart the federal immigration investigation which could have[MASK]resulted in deportat[MASK]on of Rajneeshee leaders . Three former leaders of the commune including Ma Anand Sheela , Dianne Yvonne Onang ( Ma Anand Puja ) , a registered nurse [MASK]rom the Philippines who managed the Raj[MASK]eeshee medica[MASK] corporation , and former treasurer of Rajneesh Foundation International and Catherine Jane Stork ( Ma Shanti Bhadra ) of Australia , put together a hit list which includ[MASK]d U.S. Attorney Charles Turner and Oregon Attorney General David Fro[MASK]nmayer . 
 [MASK]usan Hagan ( Ma Anand Su ) , a top official in the Rajneeshpuram hierarchy , was also a participa[MASK]t in the assassination conspiracy . Hagan was in charge of the security force at Rajneeshpuram , ran the Rajneesh Investment Corporation , and supervised construction on[MASK]the commune . Other conspirators in the assassination plot included Ann Phyllis McCarthy ( [MASK]a [MASK]oga Vidya[MASK]) , president of the Rajneesh commune , and Alma Potter ( Ma Dhyan Yogini ) , Ma A[MASK]and Sheela 's bodyguard and traveling companion . Potter was manager of the Hotel Rajneesh in Portland , Oregon , and a member of the commune 's security force . The Oregonian reported[MASK]that nine people were on the hit li[MASK]t , inc[MASK]uding : Turner , Frohnmayer , former assistant attorney g[MASK]ne[MASK]al Karen H. Gre[MASK]n , Wasco County planning director Daniel C. Durow , Wasco County commissioner James L. Comini , investigative journalist for The Oregonian Leslie L. Zaitz , former member Helen C.

Byron ( Mak[MASK]ma ) , and Rajnees[MASK] 's former secretary Laxmi Thakarsi Kuruwa ( Ma Yoga Laxmi ) .

 Cather[MASK]ne Jane Stork volunteered to be the follower who would actually murder Turner , and bought guns and silencers . Stork was known to fellow follow[MASK]rs as Ma Shanti Bhadra , and was also one of the three " [MASK]ig Mam[MASK]as " in Rajneeshpuram . Sally @-@ Anne Croft ( known by follo[MASK]ers [MASK]s Ma Prem Savita ) , an accountant and the group 's Chief Financial Officer , provided money for the purchase of weapons related to the plot . Phyllis Caldwell [MASK] Ma Deva Ritka ) described in a federal affidavit how members of the murder conspiracy obtained handguns , referring to Cather[MASK]ne Jan[MASK] Stork and [MASK]ally @-@ An[MASK]e Croft : " Shanti B went down to Jesus [MASK]rove , an[MASK] Savita [MASK]ave us several thousand dollars to use to buy guns . " Jesus Gr[MASK]ve referred to a group of trail[MASK]rs where all the leaders of the Rajneesh commune resided , except for Bhagwan Shree Rajneesh . 
 Ma Anand Sheela and three other Rajneesh followers traveled to New Yor[MASK] in the spring [MASK]f 1985 to acquire false identification . According [MASK]o a federal indictment , the perpetrators of the assassination plot used a false birth c[MASK]rtificate to purchase guns . Two members of the grou[MASK] then traveled to Texas to purchase handguns . Caldwell stated she and Catherine Jane Stork flew to [MASK]exas to purchase guns there . They purchased five guns in Texas , but encounte[MASK]ed difficulty purchasing handguns in Texas with[MASK]out @-@ of @-@ state identification and traveled to[MASK]New Mexico instead . Caldwell said they called back to the commune but the women were instructed " not to come back without the[MASK]guns " . 
 In Ne[MASK] Mexico , they obtained [MASK]alse identification , and purchased several [MASK]istols . Their intention was to [MASK]urchase guns which wer[MASK] difficult to trace [MASK] Caldwell said it was ea[MASK]y to obtain guns in New Mexico : " we found it[MASK]was pretty easy to buy guns . All you had to do was show some i[MASK]entification and it was easy to get . " Caldwell said[MASK]she and Stork went to a un[MASK]versity library to find the identity " of someone dying very young " , next we[MASK]t " to public reco[MASK]ds and asked for a copy of a birth certificate "[MASK]and described h[MASK]w " we got a rent receipt book and just made up a rent receipt " . " And then we were ab[MASK]e to go to several differen[MASK] gun shops in Alb[MASK]querque with those two bits of[MASK]identification and buy five different guns and bullets , " said Caldwell . They were able to o[MASK]tain one Colt .38 @-[MASK] caliber revo[MASK]ver , and four Ruger .357 @-@ caliber Security @[MASK]@ Six Magnum revolvers . The conspira[MASK]ors smuggled the guns into Oregon by packing them in lu[MASK]gage and putting the luggage on a Greyhound Lines bus . Caldwell said that she and Stork traveled by bus back to the Rajneesh c[MASK]mmune so as to avoid airport metal detectors .

 After obtaining guns the conspirators returned to Portland , Oregon . They [MASK]ente[MASK] out an apartme[MASK]t in[MASK]Portland to serve as their base of operations for the assassination of Turner . Raj[MASK]eesh follower Carol Matthews ( Ma Prem Samadhi ) used a f[MASK]ke na[MASK]e during the planning of the assassinatio[MASK] plot , in an attempt to obtain the home address of Charles Turner . According to federal prosecutors Matthews[MASK]obtained a college yearbook of Turner 's , and learned his car 's license plate number and his parking location . Court r[MASK]c[MASK]rds state [MASK]hat Matthews and an unindicted[MASK]co @-@ conspirator gave voter registration offi[MASK]ials fake identities and told[MASK]officials they were conducting " a voter survey on President Reagan 's economic plan " , in order to obtain Turner 's route number and post office box number . The two tried repeating the story wi[MASK]h members of the U.S. Postal Service , but the postal officia[MASK]s did not give[MASK]them Turner 's address . They then drove around Turner 's neighborhood [MASK]nd were able to find his home by locating a sign in front o[MASK] his residence that said " Turner " . Matthews[MASK]had [MASK]ictures of Turner 's residen[MASK]e develope[MASK] ; these were later obtained by the Federal Bureau of Investigation [MASK] FBI ) during an investigation of the Ra[MASK]neesh commune , and verified after being shown to Turner . 
 Members of the group of conspirators watched Turne[MASK] 's office , home and car , and discussed methods to assassinate him , hoping that his death would hinder the[MASK]efforts of the f[MASK]deral investigation into Rajneeshp[MASK]ra[MASK] . Their plan was [MASK]o shoot Turner in t[MASK]e garage of the federal office building where he worked , in Port[MASK]and , Oregon , [MASK]ut the conspirators also debated whether to murder[MASK]Turner i[MASK] downtown Portland or cl[MASK]ser to his home . After sp[MASK]nding multiple nights watching Turn[MASK]r 's house , the conspirators decided on the parking garage because they fel[MASK] it would be too risky to murder him on the drive to or from work , or in front of his home . Tur[MASK]er had a reserved parking spot in a [MASK]ederal garage underneath Terry Schrunk Plaza in Portland , Oregon . In an affidavi[MASK] given to the FBI , conspirator Alma [MASK][MASK]ralta described how the perp[MASK]trators decided on the fed[MASK]ral parking garage as the location : " Sha[MASK]ti Bhadra[MASK][ Catherine Jane Stork ] said this seems like a[MASK]good place to bump this fellow off . " 
 The conspirators practiced diffe[MASK]ent ways [MASK]f murdering Turner . According to informant statements to law enforcement , one of the conspirators was to pretend the[MASK]e was car trouble , and the [MASK]thers would then a[MASK]pro[MASK]ch Turner with [MASK]heir guns . Informants later told law enforcement officials that the conspirators intended to hide out at an international[MASK]network of Rajneesh communes if the plan was successful .[MASK]According to The Oregonian the [MASK]ssassinations were not carried out because Ma Anand Sheela became distract[MASK]d by political power plays within t[MASK]e Rajneesh commune and oth[MASK]r member[MASK][MASK]of the organization wh[MASK] were trying to remove her from her position within the group .

 On February 28 , 1985 , Congressman Jam[MASK]s H. Weaver gave a speech in the United States House of Representatives in which he asserted that the Rajneeshees w[MASK]re involved in the bioterror attack [MASK]n Oregon .[MASK]At a series [MASK]f press conferences in September 1985 , Rajneesh accused several of his recently depart[MASK]d lieutenants of i[MASK]volvement in this and o[MASK]her crimes , including the poisoning of Mike Sullivan , a Jefferson County district att[MASK]rney , and ask[MASK]d state and[MASK]federa[MASK] authorities to[MASK]investigate his allegations . The as[MASK]assination plot was uncovered by federal law enforcement as a result of the ensuing investigation into activities at Rajneeshpuram . Turner was [MASK]ever physically harmed , and had retired by 1995 . 
 [MASK][MASK]e Oregonian was informed in [MASK]ctober 1985 by [MASK]ederal law enforcement officials that Leslie L. Zaitz , an investigative journalist who had written a 20 @-@ part series on the[MASK]Rajneesh movement in Oregon , was on a " hit list " which also incl[MASK]ded Turner and Or[MASK]gon Attorney General David Frohnmayer . Assistant U.S. Attorney Robert Weaver prosecu[MASK]ed the case ; the charges were first detailed at an October 1985 bond hearing in North Carolina a[MASK]t[MASK]r Rajneesh and his followers were arrested at an airport in Charlotte . Weaver said in court that followers [MASK]f Bhagwan Shree Rajneesh had plotted to assassinate Turner an[MASK] Frohnmayer . He said these allegations were reasons why releasing R[MASK]jnees[MASK] and his followers from jail w[MASK]uld be " a clear a[MASK]d presen[MASK] danger to public o[MASK]ficials " . The guns purchased by the Rajneesh followers for[MASK]the assassination plot had reportedly been [MASK]umped in a lake at Rancho Rajnee[MASK]h ; the lake was searched by U.S. Navy divers . Scuba divers searched the lake for two days but did not find the guns . 
 Joseph Gr[MASK]ene ,[MASK]a U.S. immigration agent , testified in court that FBI age[MASK]ts had learned of the assassination plot from a member of th[MASK] organizat[MASK]on[MASK]who was in a witn[MASK]ss [MASK]rotection pro[MASK]ram . Greene said [MASK]hat members invol[MASK]ed in the assassination plot included Ma Anand Sheela , Dianne Yvonne Onang , and Alma Peralta . The a[MASK]sassination plot was investigated by the FBI and the Oregon State Police . Informants told law enforcement that Ma Anand Sheela hoped Turner 's de[MASK]th would prevent an Immigration and Naturalization Service investigation which she thought could lead to Rajneesh 's arrest and de[MASK]ortation from the United States . Weaver stated " These attempt[MASK] to assassinate public officials were because they were presentin[MASK] an [MASK]mmigration case that might result in imprisonment " of Rajneesh[MASK]. " There were not simply plans , but at least one ( assas[MASK]ination ) attempt , " said Weaver at the hearin[MASK] . 
 A[MASK]grand jury investigation led by Turner brought charges of " widespread immigration fraud " against members of Rajnee[MASK]hpur[MASK]m . Wiretapping crimes wer[MASK] discovered after Ma Anan[MASK] Sheela had fled the [MASK]o[MASK]mune in September 198[MASK] . In December 1985 , 2[MASK] followers of[MASK]Rajneesh were in[MASK]icted on wiretapping charges . 
 
 [MASK] = = A[MASK]rests and convictions = = = 
 
 [MASK]hi[MASK]f criminal assistant U.S. attorney Baron C. Sheldahl was assigned to prosecute the charges of federal wiretapping , and a special te[MASK]m from the United States Department of Justice[MASK]Crimi[MASK]al Division was tasked with prosecuting the murder conspiracy c[MASK]arges . Four of the perpetrators were [MASK]rr[MASK]sted in September 1990 . Cathe[MASK]ine Jane S[MASK]ork and Richard Kevin Langford were arrested in West Germany , Ann Phyllis McCart[MASK]y w[MASK]s arrested in South Africa , and Susan Hagan was arrested in England . In September 1990 , Alma Peralta pleaded g[MASK]ilty to conspir[MASK]cy to commit murder . Peralta , who had served as Ma Anand Sheela 's bodyguard and co[MASK]fidante , agreed to t[MASK]stify against the other defendants in the murder conspiracy . Under the terms of Peral[MASK]a 's plea agreement she received a[MASK]sentence of two years in federal prison . Carol Matthew[MASK] was arrested in Bade[MASK] @-@ Baden[MASK], Germany in October 1990 on charges of [MASK]iretapping and conspiracy to mu[MASK]der Turner , where she was held along wi[MASK]h three other Rajneeshees . At the time of[MASK]her arrest , Matthews was found in possession of a false British passport , and had been trave[MASK]ing under the fake name of " Daphene Fosberry " . Indictments were brought against Ma Anand Sheela and six other co @-@ conspirators by a federal grand jury in November 1990 . 
 In April 1991 , Carol Matthews and Richard Kevin Langford ( Swami Anugiten ) we[MASK]e extradited from Germany to the United States i[MASK] order to appear in federal court in Portland , Oregon . Law enforcement officials from the United States Marshal[MASK] Service traveled to Frankfurt , Germany and took custody of the Matthews and Langford at Rhine Main Airport . On April 15 , 1991 , Matthews and Langford appeared in federal court in Oregon , and both pleaded innocent to charges of conspiracy to commit murder and carrying out wiretapping . On April 25 , 1991 , Richard Kevin Langfo[MASK]d pleaded guilty in federal court to pa[MASK]ticipating in the murder conspiracy plot against Turner , and in exchange he received a sentence of five years in federal prison and the dismissal of other charges against him relating to firearms and wiretapping . Langford agreed to testify against th[MASK] other members of the murder conspiracy . Langford wrote on his plea agreement form : " In 1985 , meetings were held at the Rancho Rajneesh ... at which time the possible killing of [MASK]he United States Attorney [MASK]or Oregon was discussed . I participated in a number of these meetings and agreed with others [MASK]o work toward that object . " Prosecutor Timothy J. Reardon III stated [MASK]hat Langford had been a member of the Rajneesh commune in Oregon since it[MASK]began in 1981 , and that the gover[MASK]ment w[MASK]s able to prove he joined the mu[MASK]der conspiracy at a point in time after May 25 , 1985 . Reardon said that Langford was a member of a group called[MASK]the " Circle of 38 " , which was the personal security force that guarded Bhagw[MASK]n Shree Rajneesh , and that he had served [MASK]s a [MASK]eapons[MASK]instructor and poli[MASK]eman at the co[MASK]mune . Langford told U.S. District Judge Malcom F. Marsh that he had suggested that guns for the murder conspiracy could be bought in Texas , instructed the c[MASK]nspiractors about[MASK]silencers , took responsibility for the weapo[MASK]s wh[MASK]le they were in the commune ,[MASK]and[MASK]disposed of them when members of the murder conspiracy decided to flee the U.S. for Europe . In Jul[MASK] 1991 , Carol[MASK]Matthews entered a guilty plea and[MASK]was convicted in federal court , she was sentenced to five years in prison . 
 Catherine Jane [MASK]tork was convicted of the attempted murder of Rajneesh[MASK]'s[MASK]physicia[MASK] Dr. George Mere[MASK]ith ( Swami Devaraj ) in 1986 , and served almost three years in [MASK]ail . Af[MASK]er her release , agents from the FBI uncovered the plot to assa[MASK]sinate Turne[MASK] , but Stork had already fled to Germany . She was ind[MASK]cted by a federal grand jury in 1990 . In[MASK]1991 [MASK] the German government [MASK]efused to extradite Stork back to the [MASK]nited States[MASK]. In June 1991 , U.S. prosecutors filed affidavits in t[MASK]e murder conspiracy ca[MASK][MASK] with the Higher Regional Court in Karlsruhe , Germany , as pa[MASK]t of an attempt[MASK]to extradi[MASK]e Catherin Jane Stork [MASK]rom Germany to the [MASK].S. The affidavits stated that all[MASK]of the members in the murder conspiracy plot al[MASK]o belonged to [MASK] group of Rajnee[MASK]h followers at the Oregon[MASK]commune kno[MASK]n as " the 38 " , and were trained in " commando tactics using Uzi semiautomatic rifles and handguns[MASK]" . David Berry Knapp ( known to Rajneesh followers [MASK]s Swami Krishna Deva ) st[MASK]ted in an FBI affidavit tha[MASK] the murder c[MASK]nspiracy was motivated by Ma An[MASK]nd Sheela 's " tremendous ang[MASK]r " towards Turner . 
 Ma Anand Sheela served 2[MASK] months in a minimum security federal pr[MASK]son for charges related to assault , attempted murd[MASK]r , arson , wiretapping and the 1984 bioter[MASK]or attack in The Dal[MASK]es , and moved to Switzerland after her release from prison in 1988 . The assassination conspiracy was discovered after Shee[MASK]a had left the United S[MASK]ates , and as of 1999 she[MASK]wa[MASK] still wanted by [MASK]ederal law enforcement for her role in the plot , and risked extrad[MASK]tion if she [MASK]rossed the Swiss border . Switzerland declined an extradition request from the United States , and instead tried her in a Swiss court . Sheela w[MASK]s[MASK]found guilty of " criminal acts preparatory to the commission of [MASK]urder " in 1999 , and sentenced to time already served . 
 Sally @-@ Anne Croft and Susan Hagan were extradited from Britai[MASK] in [MASK]994 , and were convicted by a jury decision on July 28 , 1995 for their roles in the assassination plot . They had[MASK]unsuccessf[MASK]lly atte[MASK]pted to appeal their extradition from Britain to Home Secretary Michael How[MASK]rd . During their trial the prosecution presented twenty @-@ nine witness[MASK]s , including former followers of Rajneesh who placed [MASK]oth women in planning meetings where they discus[MASK]ed murdering Turner . David Berry Knapp , t[MASK]e former mayor of Rajneeshpuram , testified for the government in the case and implicated Croft and Hagan in the assassin[MASK]tion conspiracy . Ava Kay Avalos ( Ma Ava ) , a Rajneesh disci[MASK]le , testified in the Croft case and[MASK]stated tha[MASK] she had been part of the conspirators th[MASK]t plotted to assassinate Turner . In addition to Knapp and Avalos , co @-@ conspirators Richard Kevin Lan[MASK]ford , Phyllis Caldwell , and Alma Peralta testified in the case pursuant to con[MASK]itional plea or immunity agreements . Both women wer[MASK] sentenced to five years in prison . Croft and Hagan did not [MASK]estif[MASK] during their trial . " We hashed over every[MASK]hin[MASK] –[MASK]evidence , notes , evidence , notes . I think we did an absolutely fabulous job , " said one of the jurors . At the sentencing for Croft and Hagan , the federal Judge Malcolm Marsh described them as " people of obvious goodwill who had committed an extremely serious offense against the criminal justice system . " Prosecutor Tim Reardon called the conspiracy to commit assassination " a deadly [MASK]erious crime aimed [MASK]t the heart of the criminal ju[MASK]tice system . " Croft an[MASK] Hagan were released from impr[MASK]sonment at FC[MASK] Dubl[MASK]n , California in April 1998 , and returned[MASK]to Bri[MASK]ain .

 Die Another Day ( 2002 ) is the twentieth spy film in the James Bond [MASK]eries , and the fourth and final film to star [MASK]ierce Brosnan as the fictional MI6 agent James Bond . The film fo[MASK]lows Bond[MASK]as he leads a mission to North Korea , during which he is betrayed and , a[MASK]ter seemingly killing a rogue North Korean colonel , is captured and imprisoned . Fourteen months later , Bond is released as[MASK]part of a prisoner exchange . Surmising that s[MASK]meone within the British government betrayed him , he attempts to earn redemption by [MASK]racki[MASK]g down his betr[MASK]yer and killing a North Korean agent he believes was involved in his torture . 
 Die Another Day , produced by Michael G. Wilson and Barbara[MASK]Broccoli , and direct[MASK]d by Lee Tamahori , marked the James Bond franchise [MASK]s 40th anniversary .[MASK]The series began in 1962 with Sean Connery starring as Bond in Dr.[MASK]No . Die Another Day includes references to each of the pre[MASK]eding films . 
 The film received mi[MASK]ed reviews[MASK]. Some critics prai[MASK]ed the wor[MASK] of Lee Tama[MASK]ori , while others criticised the film 's hea[MASK]y use of computer @-@ generated imagery , which they found unconvincing and a distraction from the fi[MASK]m 's plot . Nevertheless , Die A[MASK]other Day was the highest @-@ grossing James Bond film up to [MASK]hat time if inflation is not taken i[MASK]to account . 
 
 [MASK] = Plot = = 
 
 MI6 officer James Bond[MASK]— agent 007 — inf[MASK]ltrates a [MASK]orth Korean military base , where Colonel [MASK]an @-@ Sun Moon is illegally trading weapons for African blood diamonds . After Moon 's assistant Zao discovers that Bond is a British agent , the colo[MASK]el attempts t[MASK] kill Bond and a hovercraft chase ensues , which ends with Moon 's apparent death . Bond sur[MASK]ives , but is captured by North Korean soldiers and imprisoned by the Colonel 's father , Gene[MASK]al Moon . 
 After 14 months[MASK]of cap[MASK]ivity and torture , Bond is traded for Zao in a prisoner exch[MASK]nge . He is sedat[MASK]d and taken to meet M , who informs him that his status as a 00 Agent is suspended under suspicion of [MASK]aving[MASK]leaked information under du[MASK]ess . Bond is convinced that he has been set up by a double agent in the British government and decides to avenge his betrayal[MASK]. After escaping from the custody of MI6 , he discovers that[MASK]he is[MASK]in Hong Kong , where he learns from[MASK]a Chinese agent that Zao is in Cuba . 
 In Havana Bond meets NSA agent Gia[MASK]inta ' Jinx ' Johnson and follows her to a gene therapy clinic , where pa[MASK]ients can have t[MASK]eir ap[MASK]earances altered through DNA rest[MASK]ucturing . Bond locates Zao inside the clinic and attempts to kill him , but Zao escapes . He leaves behind a pendant which leads Bond to a cache of diamonds , identified as conflict diamonds , but bea[MASK]ing the crest of the company owned by British billionaire Gustav Graves . 
 At[MASK]Blades Club[MASK]in Lond[MASK][MASK] Bond meets Graves , alon[MASK] with his assistant Miranda Frost , wh[MASK] is also an undercover MI6 agent . After a fencing exercise ( and a litera[MASK] sword @-@ fi[MASK]ht ) , Bond is invited by Graves to Iceland for a scientific demon[MASK]tration . Shortly afterwards , M r[MASK]stores Bond 's Double @-@ 0 status and o[MASK]fers as[MASK]istance in the investig[MASK]tion . 
 At his ice palace in Icel[MASK]nd Graves unveils a new orbital mirr[MASK]r satellite[MASK], " Icar[MASK]s " , which is able to focus solar energy on a small area and provide year @-@ round sunshine for crop development . Du[MASK]ing the night , Jinx infiltrates Graves ' command centre , but is captured by Graves and[MASK]Zao . Bond rescues her and later d[MASK]scovers that Colonel Moon is[MASK]still alive . Moon has used the gene therapy technology to change his appearance , assuming the identity of Gustav Graves . 
 Bond confronts Graves , but Fro[MASK]t arrives to reve[MASK][MASK] herself as the traitor who b[MASK]trayed Bond in North Korea , forcing 007 to escape from Gra[MASK]es ' facility . Bond then returns in his Aston [MASK]artin Vanquish to rescue Jinx , who has been captured once ag[MASK]in . Zao pu[MASK]sues him in his own vehicle , both cars driving inside the rapidly melting ice palace . Bond kills Zao by shooting an ice chandelier onto him , and then revives Ji[MASK]x after she has drowned . 
 Bond and J[MASK]nx pursue Graves and Frost to the Korean peninsula and stow away on Graves ' car[MASK]o plane . Graves reveals his true identity to his father , and the purpose of the Icarus [MASK]atellite : to cut a path through the Korean Demilitarized Zone with concentrated sunlight , allowing North Korean troops to invade South Korea and reunite th[MASK] peninsula[MASK]by force . Horrified , General Moon tries to [MASK]top the plan , but he is murdered by his own son . 
 Bond attempts to shoot Graves but he is prevented by one of the soldiers on board . In their struggle , a gunshot pierces the fuselage ,[MASK]causing the plane to de[MASK]cend rapidly . Bond engages Graves in a fist fight , and Jinx attempts to regain control of the plane . Frost attacks Jinx , forcing her to defend herself in a sword duel . After the plane passes through the Icarus beam and is further damaged , Jinx kills Frost . Graves attempts to escape by parachute , bu[MASK] Bond opens the parachute , causing Graves to be pulled out of the plane and[MASK]into o[MASK]e of its engines , killing him[MASK]and disabling the Icarus beam . Bond and Jinx then escape fr[MASK]m the disintegrating plane in a helicopter from the cargo hold , carryi[MASK]g away Gra[MASK]es ' stash of diamonds in the process .

The s[MASK]enes involving the Cuban locations of Havana and the fictional Isla de Los Organo[MASK] were[MASK]filmed at La Caleta , Spain . 
 The scenes f[MASK]aturing Berry in a bikini were shot in Cád[MASK]z . The l[MASK]cation was reportedly cold and windy , and footage has been released of Berry[MASK]wrapped in thick towels between tak[MASK]s to avoid catching a chill . Berry was injured dur[MASK]ng filming when debris from a smoke grenade flew into her eye[MASK]. The debris was removed in a 30[MASK]@-@ minute operati[MASK]n .

Svalbard , Norway and Jökulsárlón , I[MASK]eland were used for the car chase on the ice with additional scenes filmed at Jostedalsbreen National Park[MASK], Norway and RAF Little Rissington , Gloucestershire ; Manston Airport in Kent was used for the scenes involving the An[MASK]onov cargo pla[MASK]e scenes . The [MASK]cen[MASK] in which Bond surfs the wave created by Icarus when Graves was attempting to kill Bond was[MASK]shot on the blue screen . The waves , along with all the g[MASK]aciers in the scene are compu[MASK]er @-@ generated . 
 The [MASK]angar interior of the[MASK]" US Air Base in South Korea " , shown crow[MASK][MASK]d with Chinook helicopters , was filmed at RAF Odiham in Hampshire , UK , as were the helicopter interior shots during the Switchb[MASK]ade sequence .

The Switchblade was based on a workable model called " PHASST " ( Programmab[MASK]e High Altitude Single Soldier Transport ) . Kinetic Aerospace Inc .

 The soundtrack was composed by David Arnold and rele[MASK]se[MASK] on[MASK]Warner Bros. Records .

[MASK] The title song for Die Another Day was co @-@ written and co @-@ produced by Mirwais Ahmadzai and performed by Madonna[MASK], who also had a ca[MASK]eo in the film as Verity , a [MASK]encing instructor . Thi[MASK] is the first Bond title sequence to dire[MASK]tly reflect the film 's plot since Dr. [MASK]o ; all the [MASK]ther previous Bond titles are stand @-@ alone set pieces .

 Die Another Day had it[MASK] world premiere on 18 November 2002 at the Royal Albert Hall in London . Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Philip were [MASK]uests of honour , making it the second [MASK]ond film premiere to be attended by the Queen , the first one being You Only Live Twice in 1967 . The Royal Albe[MASK]t Hall had a make @-@ over for the screening and [MASK]ad been transformed into an ice palace . Proceeds from the première , about £ 500 @,@ 000 , were donated to the Cin[MASK]ma and Television[MASK]Benevolent Fund of which the Queen is[MASK]patron . On the first day , ticket sales reached[MASK]£ 1 @.@ 2 million . Die Another Day was the highest grossing James[MASK]Bond film until the release of Casino Royale . I[MASK] earned $ 432 million worldwide , beco[MASK]ing the sixth highest grossing film of 200[MASK] . 
 Die Another Day became a c[MASK]ntroversial subject in eastern [MASK]sia . The North Korean government [MASK]isliked th[MASK] portrayal of their state as brutal and war @-@ hungry . The South Koreans boycotted 145 theatres where it was released on 31 December 2002 , as they were offended by the scene in whi[MASK][MASK] an American of[MASK]icer issues orders to the South Korean army[MASK]in [MASK]he defence of thei[MASK] homeland , and by a lovemaking scene near a statue of the Buddha . Th[MASK] Jogye[MASK]Buddhist Order issued a statement that the film was " disrespectful to our religion and does not reflect our value[MASK] and ethic[MASK] " . The Washi[MASK]gton Post reported growi[MASK]g resentment in the nation[MASK]towards[MASK]th[MASK] U[MASK]ite[MASK] States . An official of the South Korean Ministry of Culture and Tourism said th[MASK]t Die Ano[MASK]her Day[MASK]was " the wrong film at the wrong time . " 
 The amount of[MASK]product placement in the film was a point of criticism , specifically from various news o[MASK]tlets such as the BBC , Time and Reu[MASK]ers who all used the pu[MASK] " Buy Another Day " . Reportedly 20 companies , paying $ 70 mi[MASK]lion , had their products[MASK][MASK]eatured in the fil[MASK] , a record at the time , alt[MASK]ough USA Today reported th[MASK]t number to be as high as $ 100 million .

 Rot[MASK]en Toma[MASK][MASK]es liste[MASK] Die Another Day wit[MASK] a 58 % rating .[MASK]Me[MASK]acritic gave th[MASK] film a 56 out [MASK]f 100 rating , representing " mixed or average reviews . " Michael Dequina [MASK]f Film Threat prais[MASK]d the film as the best of the series to star Pierce Brosnan and " the most satisfying installment of the franchise in recent memory . " Larry Carroll of CountingDown.com pr[MASK]ised Lee Tamahori for h[MASK]ving[MASK]" magnificent[MASK]y ba[MASK]anced the film so that it keeps true to the Bond legend , makes[MASK]reference to the classic films that prece[MASK]ed it , but also injects a new zest to it all . " Entertainmen[MASK] Weekly magazine also gave a positive reaction , saying that Tamahori , " a true filmmaker " , has re @-@ esta[MASK]lished the series ' pop sensuality . Dana Stevens of The New York Times called the[MASK]film the best of the Jame[MASK] Bond series since [MASK]he Spy Who Loved Me . Kyle Bell of Movie Freaks 365 stated in his review that the [MASK] first half of Die Another Day is classic Bond " , but that " Things start to go downhill when the ice palace get[MASK] introduced . " 
 However , Die Another Day was strongly criticised by some reviewers who[MASK]felt that the film relie[MASK] too heavily on gadgets and[MASK]special effects , with the plot being ne[MASK]lected[MASK]. James Berardinelli[MASK]of Reelviews[MASK]net said , " This is a train wreck of an action film – a stupefying attempt by the filmma[MASK]ers to force @-@ feed Jame[MASK] Bond into the mindle[MASK]s x[MASK]x [MASK]old and throw 40 years of cinematic histor[MASK] down the toilet in favor of bright flashes and loud bangs . " [MASK]f the action sequences , he said , " Die Another Day is an exercise in loud e[MASK]plosions and e[MASK]cruciatingly bad special effects . The CGI work in this movie is an order of magnitude worse than an[MASK]thing I have seen in a [MASK]ajor motion picture . Co[MASK]pled with lousy production design , Die Another Day looks like it was done on the cheap . Gary Brown of the Houston Community News[MASK]apers also described the weak point of the film as " the seemingly non @-@ stop action sequences and loud explosions that appea[MASK][MASK]to take centre stage[MASK]while the Bond character is almost relegated to second string . " Roger Moore remarked , " I thought it just went too far – a[MASK]d that ’ s from me , the [MASK]irst Bond in space ! Invisible cars[MASK]and d[MASK]dgy CGI footage ? Please ! "

[ .[MASK]. ] I als[MASK] like the fact [MASK]hat there were a lot of politically @-@[MASK]correct boxes being[MASK]ticked , but the writers and producer haven 't been restrained by that . " So , instead of bowing to this altar , they 've said , ' Okay , we have this family that 's half @-@ black , half @-@ white , half @-@ American , half @-@ British . We have a mix of boys and girls , one character who 's mixed @-@ raced and deaf – but [MASK]e 're not going to be restrained by any of that . We 're not going to tiptoe around Martha 's di[MASK]ability or anything . ' I liked that . It wasn 't some sort of reverential hands @-@ off approach to what we 're presenting . " She has also been cast in the film Dredd .

 From 7 February 2006 to 9 December 2008 [MASK] Ayola starr[MASK]d in BBC medical drama Hol[MASK]y City as nurse Kyla Tyson . She had previously appeared in Holby City 's sister show Casualty [MASK] and had made an appearan[MASK]e in Holby City 's fifth series as patie[MASK]t Marianne Lawson . She was approached about returning to the[MASK]show in a more[MASK]permanent role by BBC casting director Julie Harkin . After a series of three meetings , a year a[MASK]ter the birth of her first child , she agreed to assum[MASK] the role of Kyla , despite being " nervous about signing such a long co[MASK]tract " , stating : " I 've been someone who 's lov[MASK]d the uncertainty of acting . I 've loved that one month it 's Sahara [MASK]n Morocco and [MASK]he next I 'm doing a stage play , then it 's a six @-[MASK] part telly thing . But last summer I st[MASK]rted thinking it would be really nice not to ha[MASK]e to look for a job every couple of we[MASK]ks . It would be nice just to stay put for a while . If I [MASK]m going to be a working mu[MASK] I 'd rather just be one rather t[MASK]a[MASK] be one [MASK]ntermittently . And then Holby came along , so I 'm very grateful " . 
 Ayola signed[MASK]a three @-@ [MASK]ear contract to pl[MASK]y Kyla , and described herself as " very similar " to her character , speaking pos[MASK]tively about h[MASK]r working relationship [MASK]ith co @-@ stars Jaye Jacobs and Sharon D. Clarke , as well as the " dream " storylines he[MASK] character was given . She said of t[MASK]e show : 
 " I really love Holby and I 'm surprised[MASK]how much . What thrills me abou[MASK] Holby is that you get back what you put in . The powers that be are only as interested in you as t[MASK]ey think you are in the job . For me it 's about more than turning up and saying the lines . It 's about understanding it and trying to make it better . Tha[MASK] 's actually a lot of fun . What [MASK]s great is nobody says , ' Just shut up [MASK] ' They want you to work at it . [ ... ] I surprise myself sometimes because after two [MASK]nd a half years s[MASK]metimes I see friends on the side of a poster and I think[MASK], ' do I want to do something else ? ' but [MASK] really like this[MASK]job , I never get [MASK]ha[MASK] awful ‘ dread ’ feeling when you really don [MASK] t want to go into work . [MASK] 
 In October 2008 , Ayola announced that she would be depart[MASK]ng from Holby City in o[MASK]der to have a second child[MASK], stating : " I [MASK]ve had a[MASK]great time and I 'll miss it . I made t[MASK]e dec[MASK]sion purely becau[MASK]e I was pregnant , but I wasn 't really ready to put dow[MASK] the character of Kyla . I 'm very sorry to have to let her[MASK]go . "

 Throughout her career , Ayola has been outspoken on the subject of racial discrimination in the entertainme[MASK]t indus[MASK]ry . Describing her motivation , she states : " I am not an o[MASK]e[MASK]tly political person . I just want fairness " . Ayola believ[MASK]s that[MASK]black actor[MASK] receive less recognition than thei[MASK] white counterparts , explaining ; " If you get a show with six stars and one is black you are more likely to see interviews with the five white actor[MASK] . [ ... ] They are not being sold as a reason to watch . "[MASK]She believes that her career would h[MASK]ve taken her in a different direction were she not of ethnic origin , stating : " I could not have played any of the r[MASK]les I have played[MASK]on TV if I was white [ ..[MASK] ] I am very aware of where the glass ceil[MASK]ng is and it 's still[MASK]very low and expectations are still very low " . She has noted having casting directors accept the notion of characters being both bl[MASK]ck and Welsh to be a particular problem , explaining th[MASK]t : " I get offered a lot of very different roles , but they '[MASK]e never [MASK]elsh . [ ... ] The one time I was asked to play a Welsh character on screen was in Tiger Bay for BBC Wales , but I know if that series had been called Radyr Park or Cyncoed Close I [MASK]ouldn 't have been in it " . In 2001 , Ayola founded a production company and directed a short film entitled Persephone 's Playground . She presented the fil[MASK] at the Cann[MASK]s film festival , using it as part of her[MASK]campaign for increased black re[MASK]resentation in theatre , films and television . The project , however , was largely unsuccessful , with Ayola[MASK]stating : " it just made me decide that if there 's anything I don 't want to do , it '[MASK] produce films , because I 'm rubbish at it . I[MASK]was so bad with the budget that I just said yes to everything and then had to worry about how to pay for things at the end . " In 2008 , Ayola o[MASK]fered her sup[MASK]ort to the Action [MASK]or Southern A[MASK]rica campaign Dignity ! Period , aiming to provide affordable sanitary pro[MASK]ection to Zimbabwean wo[MASK]en .
