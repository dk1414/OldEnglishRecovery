 = Du Fu = 
 
 Du Fu ( Wade[MASK]– Giles : Tu Fu ; Chinese : 杜甫 ; 712 – 770 ) was a prominent Ch[MASK]nese poet of the Tang dynasty . Along with Li Bai ( Li Po ) , he is freq[MASK]ently ca[MASK]led th[MASK] great[MASK]st of the Chinese poets . His greatest ambition was to serve his country as a successful civil servant , but he proved unable to make the necessary accommodations . His life , like the whole country , was devastated by the An Lushan Rebellion of 755 , and his last 15 y[MASK]ars were a time of almost constant unr[MASK]st[MASK]. 
 Alth[MASK]ugh initially he was little @-@ know[MASK] to other writers , his works came to be hugely influential in bo[MASK]h Chinese and Japanese liter[MASK]ry culture . Of his poetic writ[MASK]ng[MASK], nearly fifteen h[MASK]ndred poems have been prese[MASK]ved over the ages . He [MASK]as be[MASK]n cal[MASK]ed the " Poet @-@ Historian " and the " Poet @-@ Sage " by Chinese critics , while the r[MASK]nge of his work has all[MASK]wed him to be [MASK]ntroduced to Western readers as " the Chinese Virgil , Horace , Ovid , Shakespeare [MASK] M[MASK]lton , Burns , Wordsworth [MASK] Béranger , Hugo or Baudelaire " . 
 
 = = Life = = 
 
 Tr[MASK]ditional Chinese literary criticism emphasized the life of the author when interpreting a work , a practice which Burton Watson attributes to " the close links that traditional Chinese thought[MASK]posits between art and m[MASK]rality " . Since many of Du Fu 's poems feature morality and history , this practice is particularly important . Another reason , identified by the Chinese historian William Hung , is that Chinese poems are typically concis[MASK] , omitting context that might be rele[MASK]ant , but which an informed contemporary could be assumed to know . For modern Western readers , " The le[MASK]s accurately [MASK]e kn[MASK]w the time , the plac[MASK] and the circumstances in the backgro[MASK]nd , the more liable we are to imagine it incorrectly , an[MASK] the result will be that we either misunderstand the poem or fail to understand it altogether "[MASK]. Stephen Owen suggests a third fac[MASK]or particular to D[MASK] Fu , arguing that the variety of [MASK]he [MASK]oet 's work required con[MASK]iderati[MASK]n of his whole life , rather than the " reductive " cate[MASK]orizations used for more limited [MASK][MASK]ets . 
 
 = = = Early years = = = 
 
 Most o[MASK] what is[MASK]known of Du Fu 's life comes from his poems . His paternal grandf[MASK]ther was Du Shenyan , a noted polit[MASK]cian and poet during the reign of Empress Wu . Du Fu wa[MASK] bo[MASK]n in 712 ; the exact birthplace [MASK]s unknown , except that it was[MASK]near Luoy[MASK]ng , Henan province ( Go[MASK]g county is a favourite candid[MASK]te ) . In l[MASK]ter life , he considered himself to belong to the capital city of Chang 'an , a[MASK]cestral hometown of the Du family . 
 Du Fu 's mother died shortly after he was born , and he was partially raised by his aunt . He had an elder brother , who died young . He also had three half brothers and one half sister , to whom he frequently refers in his poems , although he never mentions his stepmother . 
 The son of a minor scholar @-@ official , his youth was spent on the st[MASK]ndard education of a [MASK]uture civil [MASK]ervant : study and memo[MASK]isation of[MASK]the Confucian classics of philosophy , history and poetry .[MASK]He later claimed to have produced creditable po[MASK]ms by his early teens , but these have b[MASK]en lost . 
 In the early 730s , [MASK]e travelled in the Jiang[MASK]u / Zhejiang area ; his earliest surviving poem , describing a poetry contest , is thought to da[MASK]e from the end of this perio[MASK] , around 735 . [MASK]n that year , h[MASK] took th[MASK] civil service exam , likely in Chang 'an[MASK]. He failed , to his surprise and that of centuries of later crit[MASK]cs . Hung concludes that he probably failed because his prose style a[MASK] the time was too dense and obsc[MASK]re , while Chou suggests his failure to cul[MASK]ivate connections in the capital may ha[MASK]e been to blame . After this [MASK]ailu[MASK]e , he went back to traveling , this time around [MASK]handong and Hebei . 
 His father died around 740 . Du Fu w[MASK]uld have been allowed to enter the [MASK]ivil service because of his father 's rank , but he is thoug[MASK]t to have given up the privilege in favour of one of his half brothers . He spent the next four[MASK]years living in the Luoyan[MASK] area , fulf[MASK]lling his duties in domestic affairs . 
 In[MASK][MASK]he autumn of 744 , he met Li Bai ( Li Po ) for the first time , and the two poets formed a friends[MASK]ip . David Young describes this as " the most significant formative element in Du Fu 's artistic development[MASK]" because it gave him a li[MASK]in[MASK] example of the reclusive poet @-@ scholar life to which he was attracted after [MASK]is failure in [MASK]he civil service exam . The rel[MASK]tionship was somewhat one @-[MASK] sided , however . Du Fu was by some years the younger [MASK] while Li Bai was already a poetic star . We have twelve poems to or about Li Bai from the younger poet , but only one in the other direction . They met again only once , in 745 . 
 In 746 , he moved t[MASK] t[MASK]e capi[MASK]al in an attempt to resurrect his official career . He took the civil service exam a second t[MASK]me during the following year , but all the candidates were failed by the prime minister ( apparently in order to prevent the emergence of possible[MASK]rivals ) . He never again a[MASK]tempted the examinations , instead petitioning the emperor directly in 751 , 754 and probably again in 75[MASK] . He married around 752 , and by[MASK]757 t[MASK]e couple had h[MASK][MASK] five children — thr[MASK]e [MASK]ons and tw[MASK] daughters — but one of the sons died in infancy in 755 . From 754 he began to have lung problems ( probably asthma ) , the first of a series of ailments which dogged him for the rest of his life . It was in that year that Du Fu was forced to move his family due to the turmoi[MASK] of a famine brought about by massive floods in the region . 
 In 755 , [MASK]e received an appointment as Registrar of the Right Commandant 's office of the Cr[MASK]wn Prince 's Pal[MASK]ce . Although[MASK]this was a minor post , in nor[MASK]al ti[MASK]es it would [MASK]av[MASK] been at least the start of an official career . Even before he had begun work , however , the position was swept aw[MASK]y by events . 
 
 = = = War[MASK]= = = 
 
 The An Lushan Rebell[MASK]on began in December 755 , and was[MASK]not completely suppressed for[MASK]almost ei[MASK]ht yea[MASK]s . It caused e[MASK]ormous disruption to Chinese society : the census of 754 rec[MASK]rded 52 @.@ 9 [MASK]illion people , [MASK]ut ten[MASK]years later , the census counted just 16 @.@ 9 million , the remainder having been displaced or killed . During thi[MASK] time , Du Fu led a largely itinerant life unsettle[MASK] by wars , associated fa[MASK]ines and imperial [MASK]ispleasure . This period of unhappiness was the making of Du Fu as [MASK] poet : E[MASK]en Shan C[MASK]ou has written that , " What he saw ar[MASK]und him — the lives of his family , neighbors , a[MASK]d strangers – what he heard , and what he hoped for or feared from the progress [MASK]f various campaigns — these became the enduring themes of his poetry " . Even when he learned of the death [MASK]f his youngest child , he turned to the suffering of others in his poetry instead [MASK]f dwelling upon his[MASK]own misfortunes . Du Fu wrote : 
 Brooding on what I have lived through , if even I know such suffering , the common man must surely be r[MASK]ttled by the[MASK]winds . 
 In 756 , Emperor Xuanzong was forced to flee the capital[MASK]and abdicate . Du Fu , who had been away from the city , took his family to a place[MASK]of safety and attempted to join the court of the new emperor ( Suzong ) , but he was captu[MASK]ed by the rebels and taken to Cha[MASK]g 'an . In the autumn , his youngest son , [MASK]u Zongwu ( Baby Bear ) , was born . Around this time Du Fu is thought to have contracted malaria . 
 He escaped from[MASK]Chang 'an[MASK]the following year , and was appointe[MASK] Reminder when he rejoined the court in May 757 . This post gave access to the emperor but was lar[MASK]ely cerem[MASK]nial . Du Fu 's conscientiousness com[MASK]elled him to try to make use of it [MASK] he caused trouble for himself by protesting[MASK][MASK]he removal of his friend and patron Fang Guan on a petty charge . He was arrested but was pardoned in June . He was granted leave to visit[MASK]his family in September , but he soon re[MASK]oined the [MASK]ourt and on December 8 , 757 , he r[MASK]turned to Chang 'an with the emperor following[MASK]its recapture by government forces . However , his advice continued to be unappreciated , and in the summer of 758[MASK]he was demoted to a post as Commissioner of Education in Huazhou . The position was[MASK]not to his [MASK]a[MASK]te : in one poe[MASK] , he wrote : 
 I am a[MASK]out to scream madly in th[MASK][MASK]office / Especially wh[MASK]n they bring more [MASK]apers to pile higher on my desk . 
 He moved on in the summer of 759 ; th[MASK]s has tra[MASK]itionally been ascribed to famine , but Hung believes that frustration is a [MASK]ore likely reason . He next spent around six weeks in Qinzhou ( now Tianshui , Gansu province ) , where [MASK]e wrote more than sixty poems . 
 
[MASK]= = = Chengdu = = = 
 
 In December 759 , he briefly stayed in Tonggu ( modern Gansu ) . He departed on D[MASK]cember 24 for Chengdu ( S[MASK]chuan province ) , where he was hosted by local[MASK]Prefect and fellow poet Pei Di . Du subsequently based himself in Sichuan for most of the next five years . By the autumn of that year he was [MASK]n fina[MASK]cial trouble , and sent poems begging help to various acquaintances . He was relieved by Yan Wu [MASK] a [MASK]riend and former colleague who wa[MASK] appointed governor general [MASK]t Chengdu . Despite his financial problems , this was one of [MASK]he happiest and most peaceful periods of his[MASK]life . Many of Du 's poems from this period are peaceful depictions of his life at " thatched hut " . In 762 , he left the city to escape [MASK] rebellion , but he returned in summer 764 when he was appointed an advisor to Yan , who was involved in campaigns against the Ti[MASK]etan Empire .

 Lu[MASK]yang , the region of his [MASK]irthplace , was recovered by government forces in the winter of 762 , an[MASK] in the [MASK]pring of 765 Du Fu and his family sailed[MASK]down the Yangtze , apparently with the intention of making their way there . They traveled slowly , held up by his ill @-@ health [MASK] by thi[MASK] time he was suffering from poor eyesight , deafne[MASK]s and general[MASK]old age in addition to his previous [MASK]ilments ) . They stayed in Kuizhou ( in what is now Baidicheng , Chongqing ) at the entra[MASK]ce to the Three Gorges for almost two years from late spring 766 . This period was [MASK]u Fu 's last great poetic flowering , and her[MASK] he wrote 400 poems in his dense , late s[MASK]yle . In autumn 766 , Bo Maolin became governor of the region : he suppo[MASK]ted Du Fu financially and employed[MASK]him as his unofficial secretary . 
 In March 768 , he began his journey again and got as far as Hunan pro[MASK]ince , where he died in Tanz[MASK]ou ( now C[MASK]angsha ) in November or December 770 , in his 58th yea[MASK] . He was survived by his wife and two sons , who remaine[MASK] in the area f[MASK]r some years at [MASK]east . His last known descendant is a gra[MASK]dson who requested a grave inscription for the poet from Yuan Zhen in 813 . 
 Hung summarises his life by concluding that , " He appeared to be a filial son , an affectionate father , a genero[MASK]s brother , a faithful [MASK]usband , a loyal friend , a dutiful offi[MASK]ial , and a patriotic subject . " 
 Below is an example of one of Du Fu 's later works , T[MASK] My Retired [MASK]riend Wei [MASK] Chinese : 贈衛[MASK]處士 ) . Like many other [MASK]oems in the Tang [MASK]t featured the theme of a long parting[MASK]between friends , which was of[MASK]en due to officials being frequ[MASK]ntly transferred to the provinces :

 Criticism of Du Fu 's works has focused on his strong sense of history , his mor[MASK]l engagement , and [MASK]is tech[MASK]ical excellence . 
 
 = = = History = = = 
 
 S[MASK]nce the Song dynasty , critics have call[MASK]d Du Fu the " poet histo[MASK]ian " ( 詩史 shī shǐ ) . The most directly historical of his poems are those commenting on military tactics or the suc[MASK]esses and failures of the government , or the poems of advice which he wrote to the emperor . Indirectly[MASK], he wrote about the effect of the times in [MASK]hich he lived on himself , and on the ordinary people of Chin[MASK] . [MASK]s Watso[MASK] notes , this is information " of a kind seldom found in the officially compiled histories of the era " . 
 Du Fu 's political commen[MASK]s are based on emotion rather than calculation : his prescriptions have been paraphrased as , " Let us all be less s[MASK]lfish , let us all do what we are supposed to do " . Since[MASK]his views were impossible to disagree with , his forcefully expressed truisms enabled his installation as the central figure of Chinese poeti[MASK] history . 
 
 = = = Moral engagement = = = 
 
 A second favourite epithet of Chinese critics is that of " poet sage " ( 詩聖 shī shèng ) , a counterpart to the philosophical sage , Confucius . One of the earliest surviving works , The Song of the W[MASK]gons ( from around 750 ) , gives voice to the sufferings of a conscript so[MASK]dier in the imperial army and a clear @-@ sighted consciousness of suff[MASK]ring . These concerns are continuously[MASK]articulated in poems on the lives of both soldiers an[MASK] civilians produced by Du Fu throughout his life . 
 Altho[MASK]gh Du Fu 's [MASK]requent references to his own diffi[MASK]ulties can give the impression of [MASK]n all @-@ consuming solipsi[MASK]m , Hawkes argues that his "[MASK]famous compassion in[MASK]fact includes himself , viewed quite objectively and almost as an afterthought " . He therefore " lends grandeur " to the wid[MASK]r picture by comparing it to " his own slightly comical triviality " . 
 Du Fu 's compassion , for himself and for others , was part of his general broadening of the scope of poetry : he devoted many works to topics which had previously been co[MASK]sidered unsuitable for poetic treatment . Zhang Jie wrote[MASK]that for D[MASK] Fu , " ever[MASK]thing in this world is poetry " , Du wrote extensively on subjects such as domestic[MASK]life , calligraphy , paintings , animals , and other poems . 
 
 = = = Technical excellence = = = 
 
 Du [MASK][MASK] 's work is notable above all for its range . Chinese critics tra[MASK]itionally used the te[MASK]m 集大成 ( j[MASK]dàchéng- " complete symphony " ) , a reference to Mencius ' description of Confuciu[MASK] . Yuan Zhen was the first to not[MASK] the bre[MASK]dth of Du[MASK]F[MASK] 's achievement , writing in 813 that his predec[MASK]ssor , " united in his work traits which previous men had displayed onl[MASK] singly[MASK]" . He mastered all the forms of Chinese poetry :[MASK]Chou says th[MASK]t in every form he " either made outst[MASK]nding advances or con[MASK]ributed outstanding examples " . Furthermore , his poems use a wide range of registe[MASK]s , from the direct and colloquial to the allusive and self @-@ consciously literary[MASK]. This varie[MASK]y is manifested even within[MASK]individual wor[MASK]s : Owen identifies the , " rapid stylistic and thematic shi[MASK]ts " in [MASK]oems which enable the p[MASK]et to represent d[MASK]fferent facets o[MASK] a[MASK]situation , while Chou uses the term " juxtaposition " [MASK]s the major analytical tool in he[MASK] work . Du Fu is noted for[MASK]having written mo[MASK]e on poetics and painting than any other w[MASK]iter of his time . He wrote eighteen poems on painting alone , more than [MASK]ny other Tang poet[MASK]. Du Fu 's seemingly negative commentary on the prized horse paintings of Ha[MASK] Gan ignited a controversy that has persisted to the present day . 
 The tenor of his work changed as he developed his style and adapted to his[MASK]sur[MASK]o[MASK]ndings ( [MASK] chameleon @-@ like " according to Watson ) : his earliest works are in a relatively derivative , courtly style , but h[MASK] came into his own in the years of the rebellion . Owen comments on the " grim simplicity " of [MASK]he Qi[MASK]zhou poems , which mirrors the desert landscape ; the works from his Chengdu period are " light , often finel[MASK] observed " ; while the poe[MASK]s from the late Kuizhou period have a " density and power of vision " . 
 Although he wrote in all poetic[MASK]forms , Du Fu is [MASK]est known for his lǜshi , a type of poem with strict constraints on form [MASK]nd content , for ex[MASK]mple : 
 About two thirds of Du Fu 's 1500 extant works are in this form , and he is generally considered[MASK]to be its leading exponent . His best lǜshi use the parallelisms require[MASK] by the [MASK]orm to add expressive content rather than as m[MASK]re technical re[MASK]trictions . Hawkes comments [MASK]hat , " i[MASK] is amazing that Tu Fu is able to use so imm[MASK]nsely stylized a f[MASK]rm [MASK]n so natural a manner " . 
 
 = = Influence = = 
 
 According to the Encyclopædia Britannica , Du Fu[MASK]'s writi[MASK]gs are considered by many literary critics to be among the greatest of all time , and it states " his dense , compressed language makes use of all the connotative overtones of a phrase and of all the intonational potentials of the individual word , qualities that no translation can ever reveal . " 
 In his[MASK]lifetime and immediately following his death , Du Fu was not gr[MASK]atly appreciated . [MASK]n part this can be attri[MASK]uted to his stylistic and formal innovations , some of which are still " considered extremely daring and bizarre by Chinese critics . " There are few cont[MASK]mporary references to him — only ele[MASK]en poems from six writers — and these describe [MASK]im in terms of affec[MASK]ion , but not as a paragon of poetic or moral ideals . Du Fu is also poorly represented in contemporary anthologies of poetry . [MASK] However , as Hung notes , he " is the only Chinese poet whose influence grew with time " , and [MASK]is works began to increase in popularity in the ninth century . Early positive comments came [MASK]rom Bai Juyi , [MASK]ho praised the moral sentiments of some of Du Fu 's works ( although he found these in only a small fraction of the poe[MASK]s ) , and from Han Yu , who wrote a piece defending Du Fu and Li Bai on aesthetic grounds from attacks made against them . Both[MASK]th[MASK]se writers showed the influence of Du Fu in their own poetic wo[MASK]k . By the beginn[MASK]ng of the 10th century , Wei Zhuang constructed the first replica of [MASK]is thatched cottage in Sichuan . 
 It was in the 11th century , [MASK]uring the Northern Song era that Du Fu 's reputation reached its [MASK]eak [MASK] In this period a comprehensive re @-@ evaluation of ea[MASK]lier poets t[MASK]ok place , [MASK]n which Wang Wei , Li Bai and Du[MASK]Fu came to be regarded as representing respectively the Buddhist , Daoist and Confucian strands of Chinese culture . At the same time , the development of Neo [MASK]-@ Confucianism ensured that Du Fu , as its poetic exemplar , occupied the paramount[MASK]position . Su Shi famously expressed [MASK]his reasoning when he wrote [MASK]hat Du Fu w[MASK]s " preeminent ... because ... through all his vicis[MASK]itude[MASK] , he never for the space of a meal forgot his sovereign " . His influ[MASK]nce was helped by his ability to reconcile [MASK]ppare[MASK]t opposites : political conservative[MASK] were attrac[MASK]ed by his loyalty to the est[MASK]blished order , while political radicals embraced his concern for the poor . Literary conservatives could look to his technical mastery , while literary[MASK]radicals were inspired by his innovations . Si[MASK]ce the establishment of the People 's Republic of China , Du Fu 's loyalty to the state and concern for the poor have been interpreted as embr[MASK]onic nationalism and socialism , and he has been praised for his use of simp[MASK]e , " people 's language " . 
 Du Fu 's popularity grew to such an extent that it is as hard to measure his infl[MASK]ence as that of Shak[MASK]s[MASK]eare in England : it was hard for any Chinese poet n[MASK]t to be influenced by h[MASK]m . While ther[MASK] was [MASK]ever another Du Fu , i[MASK]dividual poets followed in the traditions of specific aspects of his work : Ba[MASK] Juyi 's concern for the po[MASK]r , Lu You 's patriotism , and Mei Yaochen 's refle[MASK]tions on the[MASK]quotidian are a few examples . More broadly , Du Fu 's work in transforming the lǜshi from mere word p[MASK]ay into " a vehicle for serious poe[MASK]ic utterance " set[MASK]the stage for every subsequent writer in the genre . 
 In the 20th century , he was the favourite poet of Kenneth Rexroth , who has described him as " the grea[MASK]e[MASK]t non @-@ epic , non @-@ dramatic poet who has survived in any language [MASK] , and commented that , " he has made me a better man , as[MASK]a moral agent and as a perceiving organism " . 
 
 = = = Influence on Japanese literature = = = 
 
 Du Fu 's poetry has made a profound impact on Japanese literature , especially on the [MASK]iterature from the Muromachi period and[MASK]on scholars and poets in the Edo period , including Matsuo Bashō , the very greatest of all haiku poets . Even in m[MASK]dern Japanese , the term[MASK]Saint of Poetry ( 詩聖 , shisei ) is mostly synonymous with Du Fu . 
 Until the 13th century , the Japanese preferred Bai Juyi above all poets and there were few references to Du Fu , although his influence can be seen in some kanshi ( " Chinese poetry made by Japanese poets " ) anthologies such a[MASK] Bunka Shūreishū in the 9th c[MASK]ntury . The first notable Japanese appreciator of Du Fu 's poetry was Kokan Shiren ( 1278 – 1346 ) , [MASK] Rinzai Zen patriarch and one of the most prominent authors of the literature of the Five Mounta[MASK]ns ; he highly praised Du Fu and made a commentary on so[MASK]e poems of Du Fu from the perspective of a Zen[MASK]priest in Vol . [MASK]1 of Saihokushū . His student Chūgan Engetsu composed many kanshi which were clearly stated " influenced by Du Fu " in their prefaces . Chūgan 's student Gidō Shū[MASK]hin had close connection with the Court and Ashikaga Shogunate and propagated [MASK]u Fu 's poetry in the mundane world[MASK]; one day Nijō Yoshimoto , the Kampaku regent of the Court and the highest authori[MASK]y of renga poetry , asked Gidō , " Should I [MASK]earn the p[MASK]etry of Du Fu and Li Bai ? " G[MASK]dō dared to reply , " Yes if you do have enough capability . No if do not . " Since then , there had been m[MASK]ny seminars on Du Fu 's p[MASK]etry both in Zen temples and in [MASK]he aristocratic societ[MASK] , and as a result his poetry was often cited in Japanese literature in the Muromachi period , e.g. , Taiheiki , a hist[MASK]rical epic in the[MASK]late 14th century , and some noh [MASK]lays such as Hyakuman , Bashō , and Shunkan . 
 During th[MASK] Kan 'ei era of the Edo[MASK]period ( 1624 – 1643 ) , Shào Chuán ( 邵傳 ) of the Ming Dynasty 's Collective Commentary on Du Fu 's Lǜshi ( 杜律集解 , Toritsu Shikk[MASK]i ) was imported into Japan , a[MASK]d it gained explosive popularity [MASK]n Confucian scholar[MASK] and chōnin ( townspeople ) class . The commentary established Du Fu 's fame as the highest of all poets ;[MASK]for instance , Hayashi Shunsai , a notable[MASK]Confucian scholar [MASK] commented in [MASK]ol . 37 of Gahō Bunshū that Zǐměi [ Du Fu ] was the very best poet in history and praised Shào Chuán 's commentary for its simplicity and readability , while he criticized old commentaries during the Yuan Dynasty were to[MASK] unfathomable . Matsuo Bashō ,[MASK]the greatest haiku poet , was also strongly influenced by Du Fu ; in Oku no Hosomichi , his masterpiece , he cites the first two lines[MASK]of A Spring View ( 春望 ) before a haiku [MASK]s its int[MASK]oduction[MASK]and [MASK]lso many of his other haiku have similar wording and themes . It is said that[MASK]when he died in Osaka during a lo[MASK]g travel , a co[MASK]y of Du Fu 's poetry was [MASK]ound with him as one of a few precious items which he was able to carry around . 
 
 = = Transla[MASK]ion = = 
 
 A variety of styles [MASK]ave been used in efforts to translate Du Fu 's work into English . As Burton Watson remarks [MASK]n The Selected Poems of Du Fu ,[MASK]" There are many different ways to approach the problems involved [MASK]n translating Du Fu , which is why we need as many different translation[MASK] as possible " ( p. xxii ) . The translators have had to[MASK]contend with bringing out the formal constraints of the original without sounding laboured to a Western ear [MASK] pa[MASK]ticula[MASK]ly when translating regulated verse , or lǜshi ) , and accommodating the complex allusions contained particularly[MASK]in the[MASK]later[MASK]w[MASK]rks ( Hawkes writes that " his poems do not as a rule co[MASK]e through very well [MASK]n translation " [MASK] p. ix ) . One extreme on each issue is re[MASK]resented by Kenneth Rexroth 's One Hundred Poems From the Chinese . His are free translations , which seek to conceal the [MASK]arallelisms through enjambement and expansion and contraction of the content ; his responses to the allusions are firstl[MASK] to omit most of the[MASK]e poems from[MASK]his selection , and secondly to " translate out " the references in those works which he does select . 
 O[MASK]her[MASK]translators have placed much greater weight on trying to convey a sense of the p[MASK]etic forms used by [MASK]u Fu . Vikram Seth in Three Chinese Poets uses English @-@ style rhyme schemes , whereas Keith Holyoak in F[MASK]cing the Moon approximates the Chinese rhyme schem[MASK] ; both use end @-@ stopped lines and preserve s[MASK]me degree of parallelism . In The Selected Poems of Du Fu , Burton Watson follows the parallelisms quite strictly , persuading the western [MASK]eader to adapt to the poems rather than vice versa . Similarly , he deals[MASK]with the allusion of [MASK]he later works by combining literal translation with exten[MASK]ive annotation .[MASK]
 In 2015 [MASK] Stephen Owen published translations , with faci[MASK]g Chinese texts , of the complete poetry of Du[MASK]Fu in six volumes , with extensive scholarly apparatus , which emphasized literalness .

 T[MASK]e Ise @-[MASK] class battleships ( 伊勢型戦艦 , Ise @-@ gata senkan ) were a pair of dreadnought battleships built for the Imperial Japanese Navy ( IJN ) during World War I. Originally intended to be repeats [MASK]f the precedin[MASK] Fusō class , they were redesigned before construction began . Both ships ca[MASK]ried supplies for the survivors of the Great Kantō ea[MASK]thquake in 1923 . They were mode[MASK]nized in [MASK]934 [MASK] 37 with improvements to their armour and machinery and a rebuilt superstructure in the pagoda mast style . After[MASK]ards they played a minor role in the Second Sino @-@ Japanese War . 
 Despite the e[MASK]pensive reconstructions , both vessels were considered obsolete[MASK]by the eve of the Pacific War , and neither saw significant action in the early years of the war . Following the loss of most of the IJN 's large aircr[MASK]f[MASK] carriers during th[MASK] Batt[MASK]e of Midway in mid @-@ 1942 , they were rebuilt with a [MASK]light deck replacing the rear pair of gun turrets to give them the a[MASK]ility to operate an air group of floatplanes . A l[MASK]ck of aircraft and qualified pilots , however , meant that they never actually operated their a[MASK]rcraft in combat . While awaiting their air group the [MASK]ister ships were sometimes used to ferry troops and material to Japanese bases . They participated in the Battle of Cape Engaño in late 1944 , where they decoyed the American carrier fleet support[MASK]ng the[MASK]invasion of Leyte away from the landing beaches . Afterwards both ships were transferred to Southeast Asia ; in early 1945 they participated in Operation Kita , where [MASK]he[MASK] transported petrol and other strategic materials to Japan . The sisters were then reduced to[MASK]r[MASK]serve until t[MASK]ey were sunk during American airstrikes in July . After the war they were scrapped in 1946 – 47 . 
 
 = = Background = = 
 
 The design [MASK]f the Fusō @-@ class battleships was shaped bo[MASK]h by the ongoing in[MASK]ernational naval arms race and a desire amon[MASK] Japa[MASK]ese naval planners to maintain a fleet of capital[MASK]ships powerful enough to defeat the United States Navy in an encounter in Japanese territ[MASK]rial wate[MASK]s . The[MASK]IJN 's fleet of batt[MASK]eships had proven highly successful in 1905 , the last year of the Russo @-@ Japanese War [MASK] which culminated in the destruction of the Russian Second and Third Pacific Squadrons at the Battle of Tsushima . 
 In the aft[MASK]rmath , the Japanese [MASK]mpire immediately turned its focus to [MASK]he two remaining rivals for imperial dominance in[MASK]the P[MASK]cific Ocean : Britain a[MASK]d the United States . Satō Tetsu[MASK]arō , a Japanese [MASK]avy admiral and military theorist , speculated that conflict would inevit[MASK]bly arise between Japan[MASK]and at least one of its two main rivals . To that end , he called fo[MASK] the Japanese Navy to maintain a fleet with at least 70[MASK]% as many capital ships as the US Navy . This ratio , Satō theorized , would enable the Imperial[MASK]Japanese N[MASK]vy to defeat the US [MASK]avy in one major battle in Japanese waters in any eventual[MASK]conflict . Accord[MASK]ngly , the 1907 Imperial Defence Policy called for the [MASK]on[MASK]truction of a battle fleet of eight modern battleships , 20 @,@ 000 long tons ( 20 @,@ 321 t ) each , and eight modern armoured cruisers , 18 @,@ 000 long tons ( 18 @,@[MASK]289 t ) [MASK]ach . This was the genesis of the Eight @-@ Eight Fleet Program , the development of a cohesive battle line of sixteen cap[MASK]tal ships . 
 The launch of HMS Dreadnought in 1906 by the Royal Navy raised the stakes , and complic[MASK]ted Japan 's plans . Displ[MASK]cing[MASK]17 [MASK],@ 900 long tons ( 18 @,@ 200 t ) and armed with ten 12 @-@ inch ( 30 @.@ 5 cm ) [MASK]uns , [MASK]readnought rendered all exist[MASK]ng battleships obsolete by comparison . The launch of the battlecruiser HMS Invincible t[MASK][MASK][MASK][MASK]ollowing year was a further setback for Ja[MASK]an 's quest for parity . When the two new Satsuma @-@ class battleships and two Tsukuba @-@ class armoured cruisers , launched[MASK]by 1911 , were outclassed by their British cou[MASK]terparts , the Eight @-@ Eight Fleet Program was restarted . 
 The first battleships built for the renewed [MASK]ight @-@ Eight Fleet Program w[MASK]re the two dreadnoughts of the Kawach[MASK] class , ord[MASK]red in 1907 and laid down in 1908 . In 1910 , the Navy put[MASK]forward a request to the Diet ( parliament ) to secure funding for the entirety of the program at once . Because of economic constraints , only four battlecruisers and a single battleship of the Fusō class were [MASK]ltimately approv[MASK]d by the Diet . Three more Fu[MASK]ō @-@ class ships ( Yamashiro , Ise , and H[MASK]ūga[MASK]) were approved and all t[MASK]ree were ordered in April[MASK]1913 . While Yamashiro was laid d[MASK]wn later that year , the IJN lacked the funding to proceed with the construction of Ise and Hyūga until the Diet authorized additional funding for the ships in July 1914 . 
 
 = = Design and description = = 
 
 The p[MASK]ogress of Fus[MASK] 's construction , while the IJN waited for the funding to be released and foreign developments , caused the IJN to reassess the F[MASK]sō @-@ class design . The distribution of the midships [MASK]un turrets was the most obvious flaw as they complicated the [MASK]rotection of the midships magazine and exposed more of the ship to the blast effects of the guns[MASK]when they fired . Another issue was that Japanes[MASK] sailors had problems maintaining a high rate of fire with the 45 @.@ 36 @-@ kilogram ( 10[MASK] @.@[MASK]0 lb ) shells used in the manually loaded 152 @-@ millimetre ( 6 in ) secondary guns used in the Fusō class and earlier designs . To resolve this issue , the IJN designed a smaller 140 @-@ millimetre ( 5 @.@ 5 in ) gun that offset its light[MASK]r shell weigh[MASK] with a higher rate of fire . It al[MASK]o decided that the barb[MASK]tte a[MASK]mour of the earlier ships was to[MASK] thin and wanted a [MASK]odest inc[MASK]ease in speed to pa[MASK]tially counter the higher speeds of the latest foreign ships [MASK]ike the British Queen Elizabeth @-[MASK] class bat[MASK]leships and Russian Borodino @-@[MASK]class battlecruisers . For financial reasons more p[MASK]werful engines could not be ordered so t[MASK]e new design was lengthened slightly and the boiler rooms enlarged to increase speed by 0 @.@ 5 knots ( [MASK] @.@ 93 km / h ; 0 @.@ 58 mph ) to 23 knots[MASK]( 43 km / h ; 26 mph ) . To save weig[MASK]t the forecastle[MASK]deck was shorte[MASK]ed so that the lower midships gun turret was lower than [MASK]n the Fusō class . This reduced the crew 's accommodations despite a signif[MASK]cant increase in the crew 's numbers and na[MASK]al historian Fukui Shizuo beli[MASK]ved that these ships had the worst habit[MASK]bility o[MASK] any Japanese capita[MASK] [MASK]hip . The final design was designated A @[MASK]@ 92 by the IJN and differed enough from the A @-@ 64 design of the Fusō class that it was considered a separate class . 
 The ships had a length of 208 @.@ 18 metres ( 68[MASK] ft 0 in ) overall , a beam of 2[MASK] @.@ 65 metres ( 94 ft 0 in ) and a draught of 8 @.@ 93 metres ( 29 ft 4 in ) at deep load . They displac[MASK]d 36 @,[MASK] 500 long tons ( 37 @,@ 100 t ) at deep load , [MASK]oughly 650 long tons ( 660 t ) more than[MASK]the preceding class . Their crew consi[MASK]ted of 1 @,@ 360 officers and enlisted men . They had a metacentric height of 1 @.@ 737 metres ( 5 ft 8 @.@ 4 in ) at deep load . 
 During the ships ' modernization dur[MASK]ng the 1930s , their forward superstructures w[MASK]re enlarged with multiple platfor[MASK]s a[MASK]ded to their tripod foremasts . Both s[MASK]ips were also given torpedo bulges to improve their underwater protection and to compensate for the weight of the additional armour . In additio[MASK] , their sterns were lengthened by 7 @.@ 62 metres ( 25 @.@ 0 ft ) . These changes[MASK]increased[MASK]their overall l[MASK]ngth to 213 @.@ 8 metres ( 701 ft ) , their beam to 31 @.@ 75 metres ( 104 ft 2 in ) [MASK]nd their draft to 9 [MASK].@ 45 metres ( 31 ft 0 i[MASK] ) . Their displacement increased over 5 @,@ 000 long tons ( 5 @,@ 100 t ) to 42 @,@ 001 long tons ( 4[MASK] @,@ 675 t ) at deep load [MASK] The crew now numbered 1 @,@ 376 off[MASK]cers and enlisted men . 
 
 = = = Propulsion = = = 
 
 The Ise @-@ clas[MASK] ships had two sets of direct @-@ drive steam turbines , each of which drove two propeller shafts with 3 @.@ 429 @-@ metre ( 11 ft 3 in ) propellers . The high @-@ pressure turbines drove the wi[MASK]g shafts while the low @-@ pressure turbines drove the inner shafts . The turbines were designed to produce a tota[MASK][MASK]of 40 @,@ 000 or 45 @,@ 000 shaft ho[MASK]sepower ( 30 @,@ 000 or 34 @,@ 000[MASK]kW ) ( Hyūga and Ise respectively ) , using steam provided by 24 Kampon Ro Gō water @-@ tube boilers at working pressures of 13 –[MASK]16 @.@ 9 kg / cm2 ( 1 @,@ 275 – 1 @,@ 657 kPa[MASK]; 185 – 240 psi ) . Both ships comfortably exceeded their designed speed of 23 knots ( 43 km /[MASK]h ;[MASK][MASK]6 mph ) du[MASK]ing their sea trials ; Ise reached 23 @.@ 6 knots ( 43 @.@ 7 km / h ; 27 @.@ 2 mph ) from 56 @,@ 498 shp ( 42 @,@ 131 kW ) and Hyūga e[MASK]ceeded that with 24 [MASK]nots ( 44 km / h ; 28 mph ) from 63 @,@ 211 shp ( 47 @,@ 136 kW ) . Ea[MASK]h of the boilers consumed a mixture of coal and oil and the ships had a stowage c[MASK]pacity of 4 @,@ 607 long tons ( 4 @,@ 681 t ) of coal an[MASK] 1 @,@ 411 long tons ( 1 @,@ 434 t ) of fuel oil , which gave them a range of 9 @,@ 680 nautica[MASK] miles ( 17 @,@ 930 km ; 11 @,@ 140 mi ) at a speed of 14 knots ( 26 km / h ; 16 mph ) . Ise and Hyūga had three generators of 150 kilowatts ( 200 hp ) capacit[MASK] and two 250 @-@ kilowatt ( 340 hp ) turbo generators at 225 volts . 
 During their 1930s m[MASK]dernization , the boilers on each ship were replaced by eight new Kampon o[MASK]l @-@ fir[MASK]d boilers , fitted into the former aft boiler room , and the forward funnel was removed . The turbines were replaced by [MASK]our geared Kampon turbines w[MASK]th a designed output of 80 @,@ 000 shp ([MASK]60 @,@ [MASK]0[MASK] kW ) in[MASK]ended to increase their speed to 24 @.@ 5 knots ( 45 @.@ 4 km / h ; 28 @.@ 2 mp[MASK] ) . On her trials , Ise reached a top speed of 25 @.@ 26 knots ( 46 @.@ 78 km / h[MASK]; 29 @.@ 07 mph )[MASK]from 81 @,@ 050 shp ( 60 @,@ 440 kW ) . The fuel storage of the shi[MASK]s was increased to a total of 5 @,@ 113 lo[MASK]g tons ( 5 @,@ 195 t ) of fuel oil that gave them a range of 7 @,@ 870 nautical miles ([MASK]14 @,@ 580 km ; 9 @,@ 060 mi ) at a speed of 16 knots ( 30 km / h ; 18 mph ) .

 The twelve 45 @-@ calibre 35 @.@ 6 cm ( 14 @.@ 0 in ) [MASK]ype 41 guns o[MASK] the Ise class were mounted in three pairs of twin @-@ gun , superfi[MASK]ing turrets . Numbered one thr[MASK]ugh six f[MASK]om front to rear , each turret [MASK]eighed 655 long tons ( 666 t ) . The hydraulically powered turrets ha[MASK] an elevation ca[MASK]ability of − 5 / + 20 degrees . The guns had a rate of fire of 1 @.@ 5[MASK]– 2 rounds per minute and[MASK]could[MASK]be lo[MASK]ded at any angle between -3 an[MASK] + 20 degrees . In 1921 [MASK]he elevation was increased to + 30 degrees and then to + 43 degrees during their mid @-@ 1930s modernization , except for No. 6 turr[MASK]t as its supporting structure could not be lowered . The recoil [MASK][MASK]chanism of the guns was also changed from a hydraulic to a pneumatic system , which allowed for a faster firing cycle of the main guns . 
 By World [MASK]ar II , the [MASK]uns used Type 91 armour @-@ piercing , capped shells . Each of these shells weighed 67[MASK] @.@ 5 kilograms ( 1 @,@ 485 lb ) and was fired at a muzzle velocity of 770 – 775 metres per second ( 2 @,@ 530 – 2 @,@ 540 ft / s ) . They[MASK]had a maximum range of 25 @,@ 000 metr[MASK]s ( 27 @,@ 000 yd ) at + 20 degrees of elevation and 35 @,@ 450 meters ( 38 @,@ 770 yd ) at + 43 degrees after modernization . Also ava[MASK]lable was a 625 @-@ kilogram ( 1 @,@ 378 lb ) high @-@ explosive shell that ha[MASK] a muzzl[MASK] velocity of 805 metres per second ( 2 @,@ 640 ft / s ) . A special Type 3 Sanshikidan incendiary shrapnel shell was developed in the 1930s for anti @-@[MASK]aircraft use . 
 The ships ' secondary armament consisted of twenty 50 @-@ calibre 14 @-@ centimetre Type 3 . Eighteen of these w[MASK]re mounted in casemates in the forecastle and superstructure and the remaining pair wer[MASK] mounted on the deck above them and protected by gun sh[MASK]elds . They had a maximum eleva[MASK]ion of + 20 degrees which gave them ranges of 1[MASK] @,@ 300 metres[MASK][MASK] 17 @,@ 800 yd ) . Each gun had a rate of fire of up to 10 rounds per minute . Anti @-@ aircraft defence was provided by four 40 @-@ calibre 3rd Year Type[MASK]8 @-@ centimetre AA guns i[MASK] single mounts . T[MASK]e 7 @.@ 62 @-@ centimetre ( 3 in [MASK] high @-@ angle guns had a maximum elevation of + 75 degrees , and had a [MASK]ate of fire of 13 to 20 rounds per minute . They fired a 6 kg ( 13 lb ) projectile with a muzzle velo[MASK]ity of 680 m / s ( 2 @,@ 200 ft / s ) to a maximum height of 7 @,@ 500 metres ( 24 [MASK],@ 600 ft ) . The ships were also fitted with six submerged 53 @.@ 3 @-@ centimetre ( 21 @.@ 0 in ) torpedo tub[MASK]s , three on[MASK]each bro[MASK]dside .[MASK]They carried twelve t[MASK] eighteen 6th Year Type[MASK]torpedoes which had a 200 @-@ kilogram ([MASK]440 lb ) war[MASK]ead . [MASK]hey had three settings for range and speed : 15 @,@ 000[MASK]metres ( 16 @,@ 000 yd ) at 26 knot[MASK] ( 48 [MASK]m / h ; 30 mph ) , 10 @,@ 000 metres ( 11 @,@ 000 yd ) at 32 knots ( 59 km /[MASK]h ; 37 mph ) , or 7 @,@ 000 metres ( 7 @,@ 700 yd ) at 37 knots ( 69 km / h ; 43 mph ) . 
 In 1931 – 33 the AA guns were replaced with[MASK]eight 40 @-@ caliber 12 @.@ 7 cm ( 5 @.@ 0 in ) Type 89 dual @-@ purpose guns , fitted on[MASK]both sides of the forward superstructures in four twin @-@ gun mounts . When firing at surface targets , the guns had a range of 14 @,@ 700 metres ( 16 @,@ 100 yd ) ; [MASK]hey had a ceiling of [MASK][MASK]@,@ 440 metres ( 30 @,@ 970 ft ) at their maximum elevation o[MASK] + 90 degrees . Their maximum rate of fire was 14 rounds a minute , but their sustained rate of fire was around eight rounds per minute . Two [MASK]win @-@ gun mounts for license @-@ built [MASK]ickers tw[MASK] @[MASK]@ pound[MASK]r light AA guns were also adde[MASK] . These guns had a maximum elevation of + 80 degrees and a rate of fire[MASK]of 200 rounds per minut[MASK] .[MASK]The pair[MASK]of 14 cm guns on the upper deck were removed at this time . 
 During the mid @-@ 1930s reconstruction the torpedo tubes were [MASK]emoved and th[MASK] Vickers two @-@ pounders were replaced by twenty license @-@ b[MASK]ilt Hotchkiss 25 mm Type 96 light AA guns[MASK]in 10 twin @-@ gun [MASK]ounts . This w[MASK]s the standard Japanese light AA gun during World War II , but it suffered from severe design shor[MASK]comings that rendered it a largely[MASK]ineffective [MASK]eapon . According to historian [MASK]ark Stille , the twin and triple mounts " lacked sufficient speed in train[MASK]or elevation ; the gun sights were unable to handle [MASK]ast targets ; the gun exhibited excessive vibrat[MASK]on ; the magazine was too small , and , finally , the gun produ[MASK]ed excessive muzzle blast " . These 25 @-@ millimetre ( 0 @.@ 98 in ) guns had an effective range of 1 @,@ 500 – 3 @,@ [MASK]00 metres ( 1[MASK]@,@ 6[MASK]0 – 3 @,@ 300 yd ) , and an effective ceiling of 5 @,@ 500 metres ( 18 @,@ 000 ft ) at an elevation [MASK]f 85 degrees . The m[MASK]ximum effective rate of fire was only between 110 and 120 rounds pe[MASK] minute because of the frequent [MASK]eed to change the fifteen @-@ round magazines . In addition the fo[MASK]ward pair of 14 cm gu[MASK]s in the forecastle were removed at this time an[MASK] the maximum elevation of the remaining guns was increased to + 30 degrees . 
 
 = = = Protection = = = 
 
 The Ise @-@ class shi[MASK]s ' waterline protective belt had a maximum thicknes[MASK] of 299 mm ( 11 @.@ 8 in ) of Vickers cemented armour amidships ; below it was a strake of 100 mm ( 3 @.@ 9 in ) armour . The upper armoured deck consist[MASK]d of two layers of high @-@ tensile steel 55 mm ( 2 @.@ 2 in ) thick and the lower armoured deck also consisted of two layers of high @-@ tens[MASK]le steel , but only 30 mm ( 1 @.@ 2 in ) thick . The sides of [MASK]his deck slo[MASK]ed downwards to mee[MASK] the bottom of the lower strake of the belt armour . The ends of th[MASK] belt armour were closed off by bulkheads that rang[MASK][MASK] in thickness from 203 to 102 mm ( 8 to 4 in ) . The turrets were protected with an armour thickness o[MASK] 254 mm[MASK]( 10 in ) on the [MASK]ace and 76 mm on the roof . The casemate armour was 149 mm ( 5 @.@ 9 in ) thick and[MASK]that of the barbettes was 299 mm thick rather than the originally planned 305 mm . The sides of the conning tower were [MASK]05 mm thick [MASK] 
 The Ise class[MASK]were the only Japanese battleships to place the pow[MASK]er magazine above the shell magazine a[MASK] the IJN[MASK]wished to put as m[MASK]c[MASK] space as possible between th[MASK] highly flammable propellant and mine and tor[MASK]edo detonations . The danger from plunging sh[MASK]lls at long [MASK]istances was not[MASK]appreciated until the fatal magazine explosions of three British battlecruisers during the 1916 Battle of Jutland graphically demonstrated the point . To further protect the magazines[MASK]the depth of the double bo[MASK]tom was increased to a total of 3 @.@ 58 metres ( 11 ft 9 in ) underneath the barbett[MASK]s[MASK]and magazines . Additionally , the ves[MASK]els cont[MASK]ined 660 watertig[MASK]t compartments to preserve buoyancy in the event of battle damage . In addition to the[MASK]torpedo bulge added when the ships were modernized , the deck armour over the machinery and magazines was increased to a total th[MASK]ckness of 140 mm . Insi[MASK]e the original skin of the ships , two torpedo [MASK]ulkheads [MASK][MASK]re [MASK]lso added and the tur[MASK]et roofs were increased to a total of 152 millimetres ( 6 in ) o[MASK] armour . 
 
 = = = Fire control and sensors = = = 
 
 Whil[MASK] the details of the ship 's fire @-@ control ins[MASK]ruments are not full[MASK] availa[MASK]le , it is known that the ships were fitted with a fire @-@ control director after completion . No computer was fitted at that time and data from the range[MASK]inders had[MASK]to be processed manually . Turrets 2 [MASK] 3 , and 5 were built with imported 6 @-@ metre ( 19 ft 8 in ) Bausch & Lomb rangefin[MASK]ers . The[MASK]e [MASK]ere felt to be inferior t[MASK] the British Barr & Stroud instruments used on other ships a[MASK]d wer[MASK] remo[MASK]ed in 1920 . They were replaced by either the British rangefinders or domestically built instruments of 6 or [MASK] metres ( 19 ft 8 in or 26 [MASK]t 3 in ) length . In the late 1920s[MASK]the fire @-@ control s[MASK]stems were upgraded and a[MASK]ditional platforms were added to the foremast to accommodate them . A pair of directors for the 12 @.@ 7 cm A[MASK] gu[MASK]s were added , one on each side of the forward superstructure , [MASK]n the early 1930s . The fire @-@ control systems were again upgraded in the mid @-@ 1930s and director[MASK] were[MASK]added for t[MASK]e 25 mm AA guns . Both ships had 10 @-@ metre ( 32 ft 10 in ) rangefinders installed at t[MASK]e top of the pagoda mast [MASK][MASK] that time . Type 21 air @-@ search radars were installed aboard the sisters in mid @-@ 1942 . [MASK]

 Ise was briefly fitted with an aircraft flying @-@ off platform for a Mitsubishi 1MF3 fig[MASK]ter on Turret No. 2 in 1927 . It was replaced by a platform on Turret No. 5 for a Yokosuka E1Y reconnaissance floatplane in 1928 – 29 . A catapult and a collapsible 4 @-@ tonne ([MASK]3 @.@ 9 @-@ long @-@ ton ) crane w[MASK]re fitted on the stern du[MASK]ing the m[MASK]d @-@ 1930s modernization , and the ships were equipped to opera[MASK]e[MASK]three floatplanes , although no hangar was provided .[MASK]The in[MASK]tial Nakajima E4N2 biplanes were replaced by Nakajima E8N2 biplanes in 1938 . 
 
 = = Conversion to hybrid carriers = = 
 
 The sinki[MASK]g of the British cap[MASK]tal ships Prince of Wales and Repulse by Japanese land [MASK]-@ b[MASK]sed aircraft on 10 December 1941 led the IJN t[MASK] realize that battleships could not operate[MASK]in the face of enemy ai[MASK][MASK]raft and required friendly air support to protect them . The los[MASK] of four Japanese aircraft carriers [MASK]u[MASK]ing the Battle of Midway in June 1942 severely limited the ability of th[MASK] IJN to provide any air cover and alternatives were sought . Earlier proposals to convert one or more battleships into carriers had[MASK]been made and rejected at the beginn[MASK]ng of the war , but they were revived aft[MASK]r Midway . Plans for more elaborate conversions were rejected on the grounds of expense and , most critically , time , and the IJN[MASK]settled on removing the r[MASK]ar pair of turrets and replacing them with a flight deck equipped with two catapults to launch floatplanes . The Ise @-@ class ships were selected for the conver[MASK]ion because Hyūga had suffered an explosion in Turret No.[MASK]5 in early May that virtually destroyed the turret and their Turret No. 6 could not ele[MASK]ate to the full[MASK]+ 43 degrees deemed necessary for the long @[MASK]@ range engagement anticipate[MASK] by the IJN . The Fusōs were scheduled to follow once the first two were completed .

 The rear turrets , the barbettes and their s[MASK]pporting structures were removed beginning in early 1943 and the openings in the middle deck were covered by 152 mm plates salvaged from the turret armour . All of the 14 cm guns were removed [MASK]nd the casema[MASK]e openings sealed off . Four additional t[MASK]in 12 @.@ 7 cm mount[MASK] w[MASK]re added , one pai[MASK] abreast the funnel and the other abre[MASK]st the conning tower . The original ten twin 25 mm gun mounts were replaced by triple mounts and nine new triple mounts were added , a t[MASK][MASK]al of 57 guns . Two each Type 94 and Type 95 AA directors were added[MASK]to control[MASK]the additional guns . The ammunition for these new guns wa[MASK][MASK]stored in the magazines originally used for the 1[MASK] cm guns and for [MASK]urret No. 5 . During 1944 , the ships ' AA defences[MASK]were reinforced with an additional dozen triple and eleven sin[MASK]le 2[MASK] mm gun mounts , for a total of 104 barrels , and a pair of Type 13 early warning radars were added . In September six 30 @-@ round AA rocket launchers were added on the sides of the flight deck .

 A 70 @-@ metre @-@ l[MASK]ng ( 229 ft 8 in ) flight deck was built above the stern and stretched forward to the rebuilt aft superstructure . The flight deck was 29 metres ( 95 ft 2 in ) wide at its forward end and 13 [MASK]etres ( 42 ft 8 in ) at the stern . It overhun[MASK] the stern and increased the overall [MASK]ength of[MASK]the[MASK]ships to 219 @.@ 62 metres ( 720 ft 6 in ) . A pair of rot[MASK]ting gunpowder @-[MASK] propelled catapu[MASK]ts were fitted on the sides of the hull , forward of the aft superstructure where they partially restricted the arc of fire of the tw[MASK] amidships turret[MASK] . They could launch aircraft up to 4 @,@ 600 kilograms ( 10 @,@ 100 lb ) in weight and required 30 seconds to launch each aircraft . The flight deck had eight permanent storage positio[MASK]s connected by rails to the catapults and the hydraulically operated aircraft lift that brough[MASK] the aircraft up from the hangar below on the trolleys used to move the floatplanes about . Two aircraft were intended to be sto[MASK]ed on the catapults and three more in temporary positions on the flight deck fo[MASK] a total of thir[MASK]een[MASK]. 
 The 40 @-@ metre @-@ long ( 131 ft 3 in ) hangar was 20 metres ( 65 ft 7 in ) wide forward and 11 metres ( 36 ft 1 in ) at [MASK]he [MASK]ear . It was 6 metres ( 19 ft 8 in ) high and de[MASK]igned to stow nine aircraft . It was fitted with fire fighting foam and carbo[MASK] dioxide dispensers as a result of wartime experience . The ' T ' -shaped lift was 12 @.@ 1 metres ( 3[MASK] ft[MASK]8 in ) wide at its forward end and 6 @.@ 6 metres ( 21 ft 8 in ) wide at the its aft end . It was 12 @.@ 1 metres long and had a capacity of 6 tonnes ( 5 @.@ 9 long tons )[MASK]. Petrol storage tanks with a capacity of 76 tonnes ( 75 long tons ) were installed in the former magazine of Turret No. 6 to provide each aircraft with enough fuel for thr[MASK]e sorties . To recover the aircraft the collapsible crane formerly on th[MASK] stern was moved up t[MASK][MASK]the[MASK]port side of the flight deck . Another crane was intended on the starboard side , but it was never fitted . 
 The ships had an air group of 11 ea[MASK]h of Yokosuka D4Y dive bombers ( Allied reporting name " Judy " ) and Aichi E16A reconnaissance aircraft ( Allied reporting name " Paul " ) Both aircraft had [MASK]evelopment problems and neither air group [MASK]ver had all of[MASK]its intended aircraft . Coupled wit[MASK] a shortage of trained pilots , neither ship ever used its aircr[MASK]ft dur[MASK]ng combat .

 [MASK]fter [MASK]he loss of the fast battleship Hiei at the Naval Battle of Guadalcanal in late 1942 to rudder damage , the IJN decided to reinforce the protection of the steering compartment an[MASK] to [MASK]reate an auxiliary steering compartment . The protection o[MASK] the former[MASK]was str[MASK]ngthened by [MASK]he addition of a concrete wall at least 1 metre ( 3 ft 3 in ) in thickness and some of the armour removed from [MASK]he turrets was used to [MASK]rot[MASK]ct the latter . The double bottom below the former positions of aft turrets was converted to hold fuel oil ; this increased the ships ' endurance to 9 @,@ 500 nautical miles ( 17 @,@ 600 km ; 10 @,@ 900 mi ) at a sp[MASK]ed [MASK]f 16 knots[MASK]. A pair of Type 22 surf[MASK]ce @-@ search radars were also fitted during the conversion . 
 The removal of the seco[MASK]dary armament , the rear turrets and their supporting structur[MASK]s was generally compensated by the addition of the flight deck , hangar , AA guns and more fuel , and the metacentric height increase[MASK] .23 metres ( 9 @.@ 1 in ) to 2 @.@ 81 [MASK]etres ( 9 ft 3 in ) at full load as a result of[MASK]th[MASK] reduction in the displacement by over 2 @,@ 000 tonnes ( 2 @,@ 000[MASK]long tons ) to 40 [MASK],@ 444 tonnes ( 39 @,@ 805 long tons [MASK] . This also reduced the draught to 9 @.@ 03 metres ( 29 ft 8 in ) . The overhang of the flight deck at the stern increased th[MASK] [MASK]verall len[MASK]th[MASK]to 219 @.@ 62 metres ( 720 ft 6 in ) a[MASK]d the beam was slightly reduced to [MASK]1 @.@ 71 metres ( 104 ft 0 in[MASK]) .

 Upon commissioning , the sister ships were assigned to the 1st Battleship Di[MASK]ision of the 1st Fleet . Hyūga had an explosion in one of her [MASK]ain gun turrets that kil[MASK]ed 11 men and injured[MASK]25 in 1919 ; the following year she accidentally collided with and san[MASK] a schooner , losing two crewmen .[MASK]Before the start of the Pacific Wa[MASK][MASK][MASK] both ships frequently exercised off the coasts o[MASK] the Soviet Union , Korea and China in addition to training in Japanese waters . Ise hosted E[MASK]ward , P[MASK]ince of Wales , and his aide @-@[MASK]de @-@ camp Lieutenant Louis Mountbatten [MASK]n 1922 during the prince 's visit to Japan . In Korea Bay when the 1923 [MASK]r[MASK]at Kantō earthquake struck , they sailed to Kyushu where they loaded [MASK]upplies from for the victims on 4 September . Together with two other b[MASK]ttleship[MASK] and a [MASK]air of light [MASK]ruisers , Ise sank [MASK]he destroyer Yayoi in 1926 during gunnery practice[MASK]. Ise[MASK]'s AA armament was upgraded in 1931 and Hyūga 's two years later . The latter ship was modernized in 1934 – 36 and Ise i[MASK] 1935 – 37[MASK], both at Kure Naval Arsenal . During the Second Sino @-@ Japanese [MASK]ar , the sister[MASK] frequently patrolled the Chinese coast in support of the blockade imposed [MASK]y Japan . In August 1937 Hy[MASK]ga ferried two battalions of Spec[MASK]al Naval Landing Fo[MASK]ces to Port Arthur . Three years later , she served as the flagship for the Emperor of the puppet state of Manchukuo , Henry Pu @-@ yi , during his state visit to Japan in June 1940 . On 15 November the ships were transf[MASK]rred to the 2n[MASK] Battleship Division of the 1st Fleet . The siste[MASK]s [MASK]ere refitted in late 1940 in preparation for war , which included the fitting of external degaussing coils and addit[MASK]onal AA directors . [MASK][MASK]

 When Japan began the Pacific War on 8 December , the sisters sortied for the Bonin Islands with f[MASK]ur other battleship[MASK] and the light [MASK]arrier Hōshō as distant cover for the fleet attacking Pearl Harbor , and returned six days [MASK]ater . On 11 March 1942 Ise and Hyūga sortied from their anchorage at Hashirajima to join the unsuccessful search for the American carrier for[MASK]e that had atta[MASK]ked Marcus Island a week earlier . Similarly they pursued but d[MASK]d not catch the Am[MASK]rican carriers that had launched the Doolittle Raid on 18 April . 
 During gunnery training on 5 May , there was a premature detonation in the left gun of Hyūga 's Turret No. 5 that disabled both guns and killed 51 crewmen . Both aft magazines were flooded to douse [MASK]he resulting fire and save the ship . S[MASK]e received t[MASK]mporary repairs during which the turret was removed and replaced by a circular armour plate on which three triple 25 mm gun mounts were positioned . On 11 May a valve in Ise 's No. 2 engine room stuc[MASK] in the open position and[MASK]flooded the engine [MASK]oom . While under repair at Kure[MASK], both ships received prototype [MASK]ype 21 r[MASK]dars . Commanded by Vice @-@ Admiral Shirō Takasu , the 2nd Battleship [MASK]ivision set sail with the Aleutian Support Group on 28 [MASK]ay , at the same time that most of the Imperial Fleet began a[MASK] attack on Midway Island ( O[MASK]eration MI ) . 
 The[MASK] returned hom[MASK] on 14 June and the IJN began preliminary p[MASK]anning to replace[MASK]the lost carriers with hybrid carriers con[MASK]erted fr[MASK]m battleships . T[MASK]e sisters were selected for conversion and det[MASK]ched from the divisi[MASK]n on 14 Jul[MASK][MASK]in preparation . They remained on " standby alert " until the actual conversions began . Ise was converted at Kure Naval Arsenal from 23 February to 5 September 1943 and Hyūga at Sasebo Naval Arsenal from 2 May to 30 November . 
 After completing her sea trials , Ise was attached to the Imperial Japanese Naval Academy at [MASK]tajima and ferried troops and munitions to [MASK]he naval base at Truk in October . In November the ship beg[MASK]n working up , joined by the newly completed Hyūga [MASK]he followi[MASK]g month , and both rejoined the 2nd [MASK]attleship [MASK]ivision . On 1 May 1944 , the[MASK]sisters were transferred to Rear Adm[MASK]ral Matsuda Chiaki 's reformed Fourth Carrier Div[MASK]sion of the 3rd Fleet . The division 's 634th Naval Air Group was formed that same day and conducted its first catapult launches in late June .

 Shortages of airc[MASK]aft and s[MASK]rviceability problems greatly retarded pilot training and the s[MASK]ips only had a total of 17 D4Ys and 18 E16As on hand on 1 October ; of these , only [MASK] and 16 were operational , respectively . The Japanese plan for the defence of the Philippines envisi[MASK]ned that the surviving [MASK]a[MASK]riers would be used to lure the American carrier forces away from the invasion area to a position where the carriers could be attacked by land @-@ based aircraft and [MASK]he transports by the rest of the IJN . The other carri[MASK]r air groups were not in much better shape and the Japanese decided to retain the aircraft ashore for use against the American carriers . The F[MASK]urth Carrier Division was assigned to the Northern Force under the command of Vi[MASK]e Adm[MASK]ral Jisaburō Ozawa and the sisters saile[MASK] from Yas[MASK]ima on 20 October . On the morning of 24 October , the bulk of the few aircraft aboard were launched to attack the American[MASK]carriers as a distrac[MASK]ion . They inflicted no damage and caused the Americans to search in the direction from[MASK]which they had attacked . The Americans finally spotted the Japanese carriers at 16 : 40 , some 200 miles[MASK]( 320 km ) east of Cape Engaño , the northeaster[MASK] tip of Luzon . The American car[MASK]iers were spread ou[MASK] and it was very l[MASK]te in the day to launch an airstrike , [MASK]o Admiral William Halsey , comm[MASK]nder o[MASK] the Third Fleet decided to mass his carriers in a po[MASK]ition to attack the following morning . Ozawa reversed course during the night , correctly believing that the Americans would follow him north . 
 Although they had lost contact during the night , the Americans did find the Japanese carriers at 07 : 35 . They had a[MASK]ready launched an airstrike of 180 aircr[MASK]ft that was orbiting 50 miles ( 80 km ) ahead of the American carriers while waiting for the Japanese ships t[MASK] be located . This was just the first of a total of five ai[MASK]strikes that the Americans launched that day [MASK] The sisters were not heavily engaged by[MASK]the early airstrikes w[MASK]ich are focusing on the group 's aircr[MASK]ft carriers . Ise claimed to have sho[MASK] down five attacking dive bombers from the second wave and one small bomb detonated on Turret No. 2 . Hyūga was lightly da[MASK]aged by[MASK]near misses that rupture some hull plating in her bulge and pepper her superstructure with splinters . She too[MASK] on a 5 @-@ degree list that was quickly corrected[MASK]before she was [MASK]rdered to tow [MASK]he cripple[MASK] carrier Chi[MASK][MASK]da to safety . Her attempt was unsuccessful an[MASK] Chiyoda had to be aband[MASK]ned to her fate . 
 Ise was attacked by 80 @-@ odd aircraft from the fourth wave , but they faile[MASK] to inflict any serious damage . [MASK]he dodged 11 torpedoes and was only hit by a bomb once , on the bulge outboard of the port catapult . Some 34 other bombs nea[MASK] missed her , spraying her with splinters and rupture[MASK] some hull plates that cont[MASK]minated some fuel oil and caused leaks in her port boiler roo[MASK]s . While an exa[MASK]t t[MASK]tal of her casualties is[MASK]not available , it has been estimated that 5 men were killed and some 111 – 121 crewmen were wounded during this attack . [MASK]yūga was unsucce[MASK]sfully attacked by an American submari[MASK]e at 18 : 43 . Around 19 : 00 Ozawa learned about a force [MASK]f d[MASK]stroyers and cruisers that dro[MASK]e [MASK]ff the Japanese dest[MASK]oyers rescuing survivors f[MASK]om some of the carriers lost earlier in the[MASK]day[MASK]and sank Chiyoda . H[MASK] ordered the Fourth Carrier Division to reverse course and engage the Americans , but the battleships were unable to find them , and Ozawa or[MASK]ered the[MASK] to reverse course and head for Amami Ōshima . W[MASK]en they arrived on 27 October , Ozawa transferred to Hyūga and hoisted his flag aboard her . While en route for Kure , the division was unsuccessfully attacked by another submarine . 
 In early November the catapults were removed from b[MASK]th ships , and they loaded troops and munitions later that month . While en ro[MASK]te they were diverted to the Spratly Islands upon reports of heavy ai[MASK][MASK]raids at Manila . After off @-@ loading their cargo , they sailed for Lingga Is[MASK]and , near Singapore , on 20 November . They transferred to Cam Ranh Bay , French Indochina and Hyūga became flagship of the 5th Fl[MASK]et there on 14 December . Th[MASK] division sailed for Singapore on 30 December and Vice Admiral Kiyohide Shima transferred his flag to the light cruiser [MASK]yodo on arrival there the following day . The division continued onwards to Lingga . Its planned return t[MASK] Japa[MASK] was delayed by attacks by the American Third F[MASK]eet on targets in Indochina and souther[MASK] China that sank two oil tankers that were inten[MASK]ed[MASK]to refuel[MASK]the division . 
 The IJN then decided to use the sisters and their[MASK]escorts to bring a load of petrol , rubber , tin [MASK]nd other strategic minerals back to Japan after the American c[MASK]rriers departed the South China Sea ( Operation Kita ) . They loaded [MASK]heir cargoes b[MASK]ginning on 6[MASK]February at Singapore and departed four days later . Also carrying[MASK]some 1 @,@ 150 oilfield workers[MASK],[MASK]they were escorted by Ōyodo and[MASK]three destroyers . Decrypted Japanese radio signals revealed the[MASK]Japanese plan to the Allies , and 15 submarines were [MASK]os[MASK]tioned along their anticipated route in[MASK]an attem[MASK]t to [MASK]ntercept and sink the ships . An additional 11 were moved into posi[MASK]ion while the group was en route , but only thr[MASK]e were ultimately able to attack . None of them were successful before the Japanese reached Kure on 20 February . The Fourth Carrier Division was disbanded on 1 March[MASK]and the sisters were reduced to 1st rank reserve ships . On 19 March Kure was attacked by aircraft from Task Force 58 and Hyūga was [MASK]it three times by bombs that killed 37 men and[MASK]w[MASK]unded 52 . Her [MASK]unners claimed to have shot down one American dive bomber during the attack . Ise was hit twice during the attack , but her casualties , if any , are unknown .[MASK]
 The ships were turned into floating AA batteries over the next several months although it availed them litt[MASK]e when they were attac[MASK]ed again by American carrier aircr[MASK]ft in July . On the 24th Ise was struck by five bombs [MASK]nd near missed multiple times ; all told she lost 50 crewmen killed and many others wounded . The bombs started numerous leaks and Ise began to settle by the[MASK]bow , alth[MASK]ugh she[MASK]was returned to an even keel after three @-@ days pumping . Hyūga was a primary focus of the attack and she received 10 direct hits a[MASK]d up to[MASK]30 near misses . She was badly damaged with some 200 @-[MASK] odd crewmen killed and 600 wounded during the attack . She slowly foundered over the next two days and was[MASK]not attacked when the Americans ret[MASK]rned four days later[MASK]. This tim[MASK] it was Ise 's turn and she was struck 11 or more times with many near misses that put her on the bottom in shallow water with a 15 degree list . T[MASK]e sisters were struck off the Navy List in November and their wrecks w[MASK]re scr[MASK]pped after the w[MASK]r .

 Ri[MASK]hard Gale " Dick " Rifenburg ( August 21 , 1926 – [MASK]ecember 5 , 1994 ) was an American football player and a pioneering t[MASK]levision bro[MASK]d[MASK]aster for the forerunner[MASK]to WIVB @-@ TV in Buffalo [MASK] He playe[MASK] college footbal[MASK] for the University of Michigan Wolverines in 1944 and from 1946 to 1948 . He was a consensus selection at end on the 1948 College Football All @-@ America Team . Rifenburg played professionally in the National Football League ( NFL ) with the Detroit Lions for one season in 1950 . After retiring from football he sett[MASK]ed in Buffalo and became a sports broadcaster . He wo[MASK]ked as a color commentator and as a play @-@ by @-@ play an[MASK]ouncer for the Buffalo Bulls . He hosted various television and radio sports shows and was eventually inducted into the Buffalo Broadcasters Hall of Fame . 
 In college , he led the Big Ten[MASK]Conference in single season receptions during his senior year and set Michigan Wolverines receptions records for both career touchdown an[MASK] single @-@ season touchdowns . He had also been a[MASK]Michigan High School Athletic Association ( MHSAA ) state champion in bo[MASK]h basketball and track and field . His colle[MASK]e car[MASK]er was interrupted by World War II service , and his high school career was also [MASK]ffected b[MASK] the war due to the MHSAA 's cancellatio[MASK] of state championships in all sports in[MASK]1943 .

 Rif[MASK]nburg wa[MASK] born in Petoskey , Michigan , and raised in Kalamazoo , Michig[MASK]n before his family moved to Saginaw , M[MASK]chigan . Rifenburg was a star athlete at Saginaw 's Arthur Hill High School in footba[MASK]l , basketball , and track and field . In 1943 , Michigan canceled boys high sch[MASK]ol tournaments in all sports due to World War II , and they did not return until the fall of 1944 . In 1944 , he led Arthur Hill High to [MASK]he MHSAA Class A high school basketball[MASK]championship ( [MASK]ve[MASK] Kalamazoo Cen[MASK][MASK]al High School ) , sc[MASK]ring 24 points , including 17 in the second hal[MASK] , of the championship game . Rifenburg was also the state champion in 1944 in both the shot put 46 feet 11 inches ( 14 @.@ 30 m ) and high jump 5 feet 8 @.@ 5 inches ( 1 @.@ 74 m ) . He also led Arthur Hill in football , and his h[MASK]gh school ac[MASK]omplishments are featured in Glory : The history of Saginaw County sports by Jack Tany ( ASIN B0006RH9Z6 ) , which is a book on high school sports in Saginaw[MASK]County , Michigan . Ri[MASK]enburg was named All [MASK]tate in football , basketball an[MASK] track . 
 It is ironic that Rifenburg was born in [MASK]eto[MASK]key , Michigan in 1926[MASK]for several reasons . Ted Petoskey preceded Rifenburg as an All @-@ American end on the University of Michigan football team . Petoskey had e[MASK]celled as a representative of Saginaw County in MHSAA competition . Petoskey posted significant football acco[MASK]plishments[MASK]in 1926 making 1926 a significant year for himself as well . Achieving All @-@ American statu[MASK] as an end [MASK]t Michigan wou[MASK]d be Rifenburg 's n[MASK]xt step after excelling in MHSAA compe[MASK]ition .

 In the fall [MASK]f 1944 , Rifenburg enrolled at the University of Michigan . The Uni[MASK]ed Press syndicate ran a feature art[MASK]cle about Rifenburg in Septembe[MASK] 1944 that opened as follows : " A[MASK]o[MASK]her great end has made his appearance on the Big Ten football horizon in the person of Dick Rife[MASK]burg , 18 @-@ year @-@ old Michigan freshman . Every [MASK]o oft[MASK]n a great offensive end comes along ,[MASK]a player who has to l[MASK]arn how to play defense , but who has the natural speed , smooth actions , height and big hands that[MASK]is the mark of an outstanding pass receiver . Rifenburg has laid claim to that rating . A loose @-@ limbed 180 @-@ p[MASK]und freshman from Saginaw , Mich . , [MASK][MASK]fenberg is being boomed as the Big Ten 's next ' freshman sensation[MASK]. ' " As a freshman , h[MASK] caught two touchdo[MASK]n passes in his first co[MASK]lege football game against [MASK]owa . In an article titled " Teens and TNT , " Time reported on Rif[MASK]nburg 's performance : " Of the few [MASK]eams already in action , Michigan 's teens rang the f[MASK]eshman bell loudest last w[MASK]ek by winning their opener , 12 -to @-@ 7 , against the strong Iowa Seahawks ( Naval Pre @-@ Flight ) ; 6 @-@ ft . 4 Freshman End Dick Rifenburg caught passes and ran for[MASK]both Michigan touchdowns . [MASK] 
 Rifenburg 's college career was interrupted b[MASK] World War II service in the United States Navy , but after missin[MASK] the [MASK]945 season , he returned to play for the Wolverines from 1946 to 1948 . Rifenburg played for the Wolver[MASK]nes in consecutive undefeated National Championship season[MASK] in 1947[MASK]and 1948 . He started nine games for the 1947 team . The 1947 team referred to as [MASK] Michigan 's Mad Magicians " is considered to be the greatest University of Michigan football team of all time . Rifenberg and teammate Len Ford had the reputati[MASK]n as the team practical jokers . During the 1947 game against Wisco[MASK]sin , Rife[MASK]burg started calling signals for the Badgers . Wisconsin 's offense proteste[MASK] to officials , who " prowled the Wolverines secondary[MASK]but never caught their man . " Rifenburg cont[MASK]nued to scramble Badger si[MASK]nals , as Rifenburg 's teammates laughed at his scheme . In the January 1[MASK], 1948 Rose Bowl that season , Michigan rolle[MASK] to a 49 – 0 victory over USC , and they outgained the Trojans 491 yards t[MASK] 133 . Rifenburg caught a 29 @-@ yard pass for the game 's final score . 
 In the 1948 championship season , Rifenburg scored eight touchdowns , caught 22 passes , and gained 610 yards ( 508 receiving and 102 rushing ) . Rifenburg was the second highest scoring end in the nati[MASK]n in 1948 , and he was a conse[MASK]sus All @-@ American as a seni[MASK]r , being selected as first team on nine of the 11 All [MASK]-@ American teams . Rifenburg [MASK]ed the Big Ten in receptions . 
 Although Rifenbur[MASK] finished fo[MASK]rth among midwestern[MASK]Heisman voters in 1948 , he did not finish among the top eight . By comparison , Notre Dame end Leon Hart won [MASK]he Heisman Trophy in 1949 but made[MASK]only eight of the 11 All @-@ Am[MASK]rican teams . It is not clear why Rifenburg did not finish higher . However , it is fairl[MASK] clear that sportswriters of that era had a bias aga[MASK]nst Michigan . In the Associated Press poll at the end of the 1947 season , the No[MASK][MASK]e Da[MASK]e Fighting Irish were ranked ahead of the[MASK]University o[MASK] Michigan , though both teams were undefeated . Som[MASK] noted that e[MASK]ery Southern AP voter [MASK]ad vote[MASK] for Notre Dam[MASK] , which had yet to integrate , whereas three of Michigan 's star players ( Bob Mann , Gene Derricotte , and Len Ford ) were African @-@ American . The Southern schools refused even to schedu[MASK]e g[MASK]mes[MASK]agai[MASK]st school[MASK] that played African @-@ American players . 
 [MASK]ifenburg was considered one of the greatest[MASK]Wolverine 's of the 1940s . In four seasons with the Michigan Wolverines , Rifenburg played in 32 game[MASK] and had over 1 @,@ 000 yards of total [MASK]ffense . Rifenburg held the University of Michigan 's single season and career record for touchdown receptions ( eight in a season ; sixtee[MASK] career ) until[MASK]his records were br[MASK]ken by Anthony Carter in[MASK]1980 .

 In 1948 , Rifenburg was drafted by th[MASK] Philadelphia Eag[MASK]es in the 15th round of the NFL draft , and he was also drafted by the New York Yankees of the All[MASK]@-@ America Football Conference[MASK]. He[MASK]had intended to pla[MASK] in 1949 with the Yank[MASK]es , but suffered a knee injury in a practice session for the August 1949 Chicago College All @-@ Star Game . Press accounts at the time noted that the [MASK]njury " will p[MASK]obably keep[MASK]him out of pro football all sea[MASK]on , if not forever . " The incident led to a deb[MASK]te as to whether NFL owners should " bar their men from playin[MASK] with the college [MASK]ll @-@ stars . " 
 Rifenburg landed a[MASK]jo[MASK] at WJR radio in Detroit , but he left his sport[MASK]c[MASK][MASK]ter 's job to join the Detroit Lions . In the 1950 NFL season , Rifenburg came back from his injury to play for the Detroit Lions . H[MASK] played in [MASK]2 games and ha[MASK] ten receptions for [MASK]6 yards and one touchdown for the 1950 Lions . Rifenburg recalled that[MASK]his playing time [MASK]ith the [MASK]ions was [MASK]imited because the Lions also signe[MASK] 1949 Heisman Trophy winn[MASK]r Leon Ha[MASK]t , who played the same position . 
 In May 1951 , he announced he was re[MASK]iring from professional football to become sports director at a radio station in Buffalo . He was hired as a sportscast[MASK]r[MASK]by WBEN ( now known as WIVB ) , which had just started the first television station in Buffalo and the only one serving Southern Ontario . This was an early foray into tele[MASK]ision by th[MASK] B[MASK]ffalo Evening News . In the 1950s , Rif[MASK][MASK]burg hosted a[MASK]popular panel show called " Let [MASK]s Talk Sports " in Buffalo [MASK]nd also pioneered an early morning exercis[MASK] program [MASK] He also wo[MASK]ked for WBEN ( AM ) and WBEN ([MASK]FM ) and as the sideline announcer for Buffalo [MASK]ills games along with Van Miller , the long time Bills play @-@ by @-@ play announc[MASK]r . In addition , he served as t[MASK]e play @-@ [MASK]y @-@ play an[MASK]ouncer for the University of Buffalo Bulls fo[MASK]tball team . As a [MASK]adio broadcaster[MASK], he is rememb[MASK]red for things ranging from ski [MASK]e[MASK]orts , to 17 years worth of " Breakfast At — " programs live from various local restaurants , to 27 years as [MASK]he WBEN @-@ AM All Ni[MASK]ht Show hos[MASK] [MASK] 
 After 30 years with [MASK]BEN and a ch[MASK]nge in ownership for the station , his show was replaced with the Mutual Network 's The Larry King Show . I[MASK] the 1980s , Rifenburg taught communications at Buffalo 's Medaille College and se[MASK]ved as a disc jockey on P[MASK]blic Broadcasti[MASK]g 's radio station WEBR ( now WDCZ ) . He also sold ads for Buffalo Evening News com[MASK]etitor , Buffalo Courier @-@ Express . Rifenburg 's final employer was Erie C[MASK]unty[MASK], who hired him as an inmate training supervisor at t[MASK]e Erie Co[MASK]nty Correctional Facility . 
 Rifenburg was posthumously inducted into the Buffalo Broadcasters Hall of Fame in Se[MASK]t[MASK]mber 2007 . He wa[MASK] given the Golden Age Award which is reserved for " those who did it first , the people who had no pattern to follow . " The Hall of Fame aw[MASK]rd w[MASK]s presented to Rifenburg 's wi[MASK]e , Jane .

 T[MASK]e 1933 Treasure[MASK]Coast hurricane was the second @-@ most intense tropical cyclone to strike the United States during the active 1933 Atlantic hurricane season . The eleventh tropical storm , fifth hurricane , and the third major hurricane of the season , it formed east @-@ northeast of the Leeward Islands on August 31 . The tropical storm moved rapidly west @-@ northwestward , steadily intensifying to a hurricane . It[MASK]acqui[MASK]ed peak winds of 140 m[MASK]les per hour ( 225 km / h ) and passed over portions of the Bahamas on September 3 , including Eleuthera a[MASK]d Harbour Island , causing severe damage to[MASK]crops , buildings , and infrastructure . Winds over 100 mph ( 161 km / h ) affected many[MASK]islands in its path , especially those that encountered its cent[MASK]r , and many wharves were ruined . 
 Subsequently , it weakened and made landfall at Jupiter , Florida , early on September 4 with winds of 125 mph ( 201 km / h ) . The hurricane moved across the state , passing[MASK]near Tampa before moving into Georgia and dissipating . In Florida , the strong winds of the cyclone blew buildings off their foundations , and numero[MASK]s trees were prostrated in citrus groves[MASK]. The Treasure Coast region[MASK]received the most extens[MASK]ve destruction , and Stuart , Jupiter , and Fort Pierce were heavily damaged . I[MASK]land , the cyclone weakened rapidly but produced prodigious amounts of rain , causing a dam to collapse near Tampa . The storm caused $ 3 million in damage ( 1933 U[MASK]D ) after damaging or destroying 6 @,@ 848 homes . 
 Unusually , the storm hit Florida less than 24 hours before another major hurricane bearing 125 @-@ mile [MASK]-@ per @-@ ho[MASK]r ( 201 km / h ) winds struck South Texas ; never have two major cyclones hit[MASK]the United States in such close succession .

 The origins of the hurricane were from a tropical wave t[MASK]at possibly s[MASK]awned a tropical depres[MASK]ion o[MASK] August 27 , although there was minim[MASK]l data over the next few days as it tracked to the west @-@ northwest . On August 31 , a n[MASK]arby ship reported gale force winds , wh[MASK]ch indic[MASK]ted that a tr[MASK]pical storm had developed to t[MASK]e east @-@ northea[MASK]t of the Lesser Antilles . Based on[MASK]continuity , i[MASK] is estimated th[MASK] storm a[MASK]tained hurricane status later that day . Moving quickly to the[MASK]west @-[MASK] northwest , the storm passed north of the Le[MASK]ser Antilles and Puerto Rico . Early on Sept[MASK]mber 2 , a ship called the Gulfwing reported[MASK]a barometric pressure of 97[MASK] mbar ( 28 @.@ 88 inHg ) , which confirmed that the storm attained hurricane status . After passing north of the Turks and Caicos islands , the hurricane struck Eleuthera and Harbour Island in the [MASK]ahamas on September 3 , the latter at 1100 UTC . A station on the latter island re[MASK]orted a pressure of 27 @.@ 90 inHg ( 945 mb ) during the 30 minute passage o[MASK] the eye . Based on the pressure and the small size [MASK]f the storm , it is estimated the [MASK]urricane struck Harbour [MASK]sland with peak winds of 140 mph ( 225 km / h ) , making it the equivalent of a modern Category 4 hurricane on the Saffir @-[MASK] Simpson scale . I[MASK]terpolation suggested that the storm reached major hurr[MASK]cane status , or Category 3 status , on September 2 . 
 The hurricane initially followed the course of another hurricane th[MASK]t passed through the area in late August , which ultimately struck Cuba and Texas . This hurricane instead maintained a general west @-@ northwest track . After moving through the northern B[MASK]hamas , t[MASK]e hurricane [MASK]eakened slightly before making landfall at Jupi[MASK]er , Florida , [MASK]t 0500 UTC on September 4 . A station ther[MASK] reported a pressure of 27 @.@ 9[MASK] [MASK]nHg ( 948[MASK]mb ) during a 40 minute period of [MASK]he eye 's passage ; this sugge[MASK]ted a landfall strength[MASK]of 125 mph ( 201 km / h ) . At the time , the radius of ma[MASK]imum winds was 15 mi ( 24 km ) , which was smaller than average . After landf[MASK]ll [MASK] the hurricane weakened rapidly while crossin[MASK] the state . It briefly emerged into the Gulf[MASK]of Mexi[MASK]o as a tropical storm early on September 5 [MASK] A few hours later while continuing [MASK]o the nor[MASK]hwest , it made anot[MASK]er lan[MASK]fall near Rosewo[MASK]d — a ghost town in [MASK]evy County , east of Cedar Key — with winds of about 65 mph ( 105 km / h ) . Turning to the north , the storm slowly weakened as it crossed into Georgia , dissipating on September 7 near Augusta .

 On September 2 , a fleet of eight aircraft evacuated all white residents from West End , Grand Bahama , to Day[MASK]ona Beach , Florida . While the[MASK]storm was near peak intensity on September 3 , the Weather Bureau issued hurricane warnings from Miami to Melbour[MASK]e , Florida , with storm warnings extending northw[MASK]rd to Jacksonville . Later that day , storm warnings , were issued from Key West to Cedar[MASK]Key . About 2 @,[MASK] 500 people evacuated by train[MASK]from areas around Lake Okeechobee . By evening on September 3 , high ti[MASK]es sent sea spray over coastal seawalls in Palm Beach [MASK]ounty as residents boar[MASK]ed up buildings ; s[MASK]ructures on Clematis Street in West Palm Beach were said to [MASK]e a " solid front " of p[MASK]ywood [MASK] Along the coa[MASK]t , observers reported very rough seas as the eye neared land . 
 The powerful hurr[MASK]cane moved over or near several islands in the Bahamas . Winds on Spanish Wells and Harbour Island were both estimated at around 140 mph ( 225 km / h ) . Winds reached 110 mph ( 177 km / h ) at Governor 's Harbour , 100 mph ( 161 km / h ) on Eleuthera , and 120 mph ( 193 km / h ) on the Abaco Islands . The storm was farther away from Nassau , where winds reached 61 mph ( 98 km / h ) . The hurricane da[MASK]aged a lumber mill on Abaco , washing awa[MASK] a dock . Heavy dam[MASK]ge occurred on Harbour Island , including to seve[MASK]al roofs , the walls of government buildings , a[MASK]d the water system . The hurricane destroye[MASK] four churches and 37 houses , leaving 100 people homeless . A 1 [MASK].@ 5 mi ( 2 @.@ 4 km ) road on Eleuthera was destroyed . Several islands sustained damage to farms , including the total los[MASK] of various fruit t[MASK]ees on Russell Island . D[MASK]spite Category 4 winds o[MASK] Spanish Wells , on[MASK]y five houses were destroy[MASK]d , although most of the remaining dwellings lost their roofs . Collectively between North Point , James Cistern , and Gregory Town on Eleuthera , the sto[MASK]m destroyed 55 houses and damaged ma[MASK]y others . [MASK]n [MASK]rand Bahama , where a 9 to 12 ft ( 2 @.@ 7 to 3 @.@ 7 m ) storm surge was reported , half of the houses were destroyed , as were 13 boats and two planes , and most docks were wrecked . 
 When the storm [MASK]oved ashore in Florida , winds [MASK]eached an estimated 125 mph[MASK]( 201 km / h ) in Jupiter ; these occurred after the ey[MASK] passed . In W[MASK]st Palm Beach , anemometers measured at least 80 @-[MASK] mile @-@ per @-@ hour ( 129 km / h ) winds with gusts to 100 mph ( 161 km / h ) ;[MASK]barometers ranged from 28 @.@ 64 to 28 @.@ 78 inHg ( 970 to 975 mb ) . The storm produced the strongest winds in the city since the 1928 Okeech[MASK]bee hurr[MASK]cane . Winds were not as strong farth[MASK]r from the cente[MASK] ; 40 to 45 mph ( 64 to 72 km [MASK] h ) winds were observed in M[MASK]ami to the south , Titusville to t[MASK]e north , and Tam[MASK]a on the west coast . Fort Pierce estimated peak winds of 80 to [MASK]0 mph ( 129 to 145 km / h ) , and pressures dipped to 29 @.@ 14 inHg ( 987 mb ) . Inla[MASK]d , winds near Lake Okeechobee peaked at only 60 mp[MASK] ( 97 km / h ) . The hurricane dropped heavy rai[MASK]fall along its path , peaking at 17 @.@ 8 in ( 450 mm )[MASK]in[MASK]Clermont . 
 At West Palm Beach , the majority of the damage was confined to vegetation . Several coconut and royal palms th[MASK]t withstood the 1928 hurricane snapped [MASK] littering streets with broken trunks . Winds downed road signs on [MASK]any streets , and floodwaters covered the greens[MASK]on a local golf co[MASK]rse . Some gar[MASK]ges and isolated structures , [MASK]ostly [MASK]ightweigh[MASK] , were partly or totally destroyed , along with a lumber warehouse . Some h[MASK]mes that lost roofi[MASK]g shingles had water damage to their interiors as well . Nea[MASK]by Lake Wort[MASK] sustained extensive breakage of windows , including plate glass , and loss of tile and shingle roofing , but preparations reduced losses to[MASK]just several thousand dollars , and no post @-@ storm accidents took place . Strong winds snapped many light poles in the city , and trees and s[MASK]rubs were broken or uprooted . As in Lake [MASK]orth , officials in West Palm Beach credited preparations and stringent building codes with reduc[MASK]ng overall damage . The[MASK]city had learned from previous experience with severe storms i[MASK] 1926 , 1928 , and 1929 . High tides eroded Ocean Boulev[MASK][MASK]d at several spots [MASK]nd disrupted[MASK]access to several bridges on the Lake Worth Lagoon .[MASK]Winter estates and hotels on Palm Beach generally sustained little material damage , except to vegetation , and county properties went largely uns[MASK]athed . 
 In Martin and St[MASK] [MASK]ucie counties , the storm was considered among the[MASK]worst on record . The storm [MASK][MASK]veled [MASK]ome homes and swept many others off their foundations . At Stuart , winds removed or[MASK]badly damaged 75 % of the roofs in town . The storm destroyed the third floor of the[MASK]building that housed a bowling alley and the Stuart New[MASK] , a local newspaper[MASK]. At Olympia , an aban[MASK]oned settlement also known as [MASK]lympia Beach , strong winds leveled the old Olympia Inn , a gas station , and the second floor of a pharmaceutical building . Winds also to[MASK]e the roof off an ice plant . A bridge leading to the barrier island from Olymp[MASK]a was partly wrecked ; the bridge tender survived[MASK]by gripping the [MASK]ailing during the storm . Wi[MASK]ds leveled his nearby home . According to the Monthly Weather Review , some of the most severe damage f[MASK]om the storm in Fl[MASK]rida was at Olympia .[MASK]The storm left many homes in Hobe So[MASK]nd un[MASK]nhabitable [MASK] forcing crews to[MASK]tear them down . Winter estates on the island , however , were better built and little damaged . While[MASK]Stuart and[MASK]Hobe Sound sustained signif[MASK]cant damage , Port Salerno suffer[MASK]d minimally . In Stuart , the storm left 400 to 500 people homeless , up to nearly 10 % of the population , which was 5 @,@ 100 at the[MASK]time . Betwe[MASK]n Jupiter and Fort Pierce , the storm knocked d[MASK]wn power and telegraph lines . In the latter city , high waves was[MASK]ed[MASK]out a port[MASK]on of the causeway . In the 1980s , an elderly resident r[MASK]called that the storm was the most severe on record in Fort Pierce . 
 Crop damage was worst along the Indian R[MASK]ver Lagoon ; [MASK]everal fa[MASK]ms in Stuart experienced to[MASK]al losses , and statewide , 16 % of the citrus crop , or 4 million boxes , were destroyed . Many chicken coops in Stuart were destroyed , and the lo[MASK]al chicken population was scattered and dispersed as far as Indi[MASK]ntown . Across southeastern [MASK]lorida , the hurricane damaged 6 @,[MASK] [MASK]65 houses and destroyed anot[MASK]er 383 , causing over $ 3 m[MASK]llion in damage . One person , an African American farm worker , was killed when his shack blew d[MASK]wn in Gomez , a brakeman died afte[MASK] seven rail[MASK]ars derailed , and a child was killed by airborne debris . 
 High rainfall caused flooding across Florida , [MASK]otably near Ta[MASK]pa where waters reached [MASK] ft ( 2 @.@ 7 m ) deep . High rainfall of over 7 in ( 180 [MASK]m ) caused a dam operated by Tampa Electric Co. to break 3 mi ( 4 @.@ 8 km ) northeast of Tampa along the Hillsborough River . The break resulted in severe local damage , flooding portions of Sulphur Springs .[MASK][MASK]orkers attempted to save the dam wit[MASK] sandbags[MASK], and after the break , most residents in the area were warne[MASK] of the approaching flood . Over 50 [MASK]o[MASK]es were flooded , forcing a[MASK]out 150 people to evacuat[MASK] . Outside Florida , the storm produced winds of 48 and 51 mph ( 78 and 8[MASK] km[MASK]/ h ) in Savannah , Georgia and Charleston , South Caroli[MASK]a , res[MASK]ectively . In th[MASK] latter city , the storm[MASK]sp[MASK]wne[MASK] a tornado , which caused about $ 10 @,@ 000 in property damage . Heavy rainfall occurred[MASK]along the Georgia and South Carolina coasts , reaching over 12 in ( 300 mm ) . Light rainfa[MASK]l also extended into North[MASK]Carolina .

[MASK]
 The Second Battle of Naktong Bulge was an engagement between United Nati[MASK]ns ( UN ) and North Korean ( NK ) forces early in the Korean War from Septe[MASK]ber 1 to September 15 , 1950 , along the Naktong [MASK]iver in Sou[MASK]h Korea . It[MASK]was a part of t[MASK]e Battle of Pusan Perimeter , and was one of several large engagements fought simultaneously . The battle ended in a victory for the United Nations after large numbers of United States ( US ) and Republic of Korea ( ROK ) troops repelled a strong Nort[MASK] Korean attack . 
[MASK]After the F[MASK]rst Battle of Naktong[MASK]Bulge , the US Army 's 2nd Infantry Division was moved to defend the Naktong River line . The division , which was untried in combat , was struck with a strong attack by several divisions of the Korean People 's Army which cro[MASK]sed th[MASK] river and struck all along the division 's line . The force of the attack split the US 2nd Infantr[MASK] Division in half , and the North Koreans were able to penetrate to Yong[MASK]a[MASK] , promoting a fight there . 
 The urgenc[MASK] of the threat to Pusan Perimeter prompted [MASK]he US Marine Corps 1st Provision[MASK]l Marine Brigade to be brought in to reinforce t[MASK]e US Army troops . In two weeks of heavy fighting , the US forces were able to force the No[MASK]th Koreans out of the Naktong Bulge region . The North Koreans were further repulsed after the UN counteratta[MASK]k at Inchon , which culminated in the virtual destruction of the North Korean army .

 From the outbreak of the Korean War and the invasion of[MASK]South[MASK]Korea by the North , the North Korean People 's Army had enjoyed superiority in both [MASK]anpower and equipment over both the Republic of Korea Army and the United N[MASK]tions forces [MASK]ispatched to South Korea to prevent[MASK]it from collapsing . The Nort[MASK] Korean strategy was to aggressively pursue UN and ROK forces on all avenues of approach south and to engage them aggressively , attacking [MASK]rom the front and initiating a double envelop[MASK]ent of both flanks of the unit , which allowed the[MASK]North Koreans to surround and cut off[MASK]the opposing [MASK]orce , which would[MASK]then be forced to retreat i[MASK] dis[MASK]rray , often leaving behind much of its equipment . From their initial June 25 offensive to fights in July and early August , the North Koreans used this[MASK]strategy to effectively defeat any UN force and [MASK]ush it so[MASK]th . However , when the UN forces , under the Eighth Unite[MASK] States Army , established the Pusan Perimeter in August , the UN troops held a continuous line along the peninsula which North Korean[MASK]troops could not flank , and their [MASK]dva[MASK]tages in numbers decreased daily as the superior UN logistical system brought in [MASK]ore [MASK]roops and supplies to the UN army . 
 When th[MASK] North Koreans approached the Pusan Perimeter on August 5 , they attempted the [MASK]ame frontal assault te[MASK]hnique on the four [MASK]ain avenues of approach into the perimeter . Throughout August , the NK 6th Divi[MASK]ion , and later the NK 7th Division[MASK]engaged the US 25th In[MASK]antry Divisi[MASK]n at the Battle of Masan , initially repelling a UN counteroffensive before countering with battles at Kom[MASK]m @-@ ni [MASK]nd Battle Mountain . These attacks stalled as UN forces , well equipped and with plenty of reserves , repeatedly repelled Nort[MASK] Korean attacks . North of Masan , the NK 4th Division and the US 24th Infantry Division sparred in the Naktong Bulge area . In the First Battle of Naktong Bulge , the North Korean division was unable to hold [MASK]ts bridgehead across the ri[MASK]er as large numbers of US reserve forces were brought in to rep[MASK]l it , and on August 19 , the NK 4th Division was forced back ac[MASK]oss the river with 50 percent casualties . In the Taegu region , five North Korean d[MASK]visions [MASK]ere repulsed by three UN divisions in several attempts to attack the city during the Battle of Taegu . Particularly heavy fighting took plac[MASK] at the Ba[MASK]tle of the Bowling Alley where the NK 13th Division was almost completely destroyed i[MASK] the attack . On the east coast , three more North Korean divisions were repulsed by th[MASK] South Koreans at P 'ohang @-@ dong during the Battle of[MASK]P 'ohang @-@ dong . All along the front , the North Kore[MASK]n troops were reeling from these defeats , [MASK]h[MASK] first time in the war their strategies were not working . 
 
 = = = September push = = = 
 
 In planning its new offensive , the North Kor[MASK]an command decided any attempt to [MASK]lank the UN force was impossible thanks to the support of the UN navy . Instead , they opted to use frontal attack to breach the perimeter and collapse it[MASK]as the only hop[MASK] of achievi[MASK]g success in the battle . Fed by intelligence from the Soviet Union the North Koreans were aware the UN forces were building up [MASK]long th[MASK] Pusan Perimeter and that it must conduct an offen[MASK]ive[MASK]soon or it could not win the battle . A secondary objective was to surround Taegu and destroy the UN and RO[MASK] units in that city . As part of this miss[MASK]on , the North Korean units would[MASK]first cut the[MASK]supply lines to Taegu . 
 On August 20 , the North Korean commands distributed operations orders to their subordi[MASK]ate units . The North Koreans called for a simultaneous five @-@ prong attack against the UN lines . These atta[MASK]ks would overwhelm the UN defenders and allow the North Koreans to break through the lines in [MASK]t least one place to force the UN [MASK]orces back . Five battle [MASK]roupings w[MASK]re ordered . The center attack called for the NK[MASK]9th Division , NK 4th Division , NK 2nd Divisio[MASK] , and NK 10th Division break through the US 2nd Infantry Divisio[MASK] at the Naktong Bulge to M[MASK]ryang and Yongsan .

 During the North Koreans ' September 1 offens[MASK]ve ,[MASK]the US[MASK]25th [MASK]nfantry Division 's U[MASK] 35th Infantry Regiment was heavily engaged in the Battle of Nam River north of Masan . On the 3[MASK]th Regiment 's right flank , just north of the confluence of the Nam River and the Naktong Rive[MASK] , was the US 9th Infantry Regiment , US 2nd Infantry Division . There , in the southernmost part of the 2nd Infantry Division[MASK]zone , the 9th Infantry Regiment held a[MASK]sector more than 20 @,@ 00[MASK] yards ( 18 @,@ 000 m ) long , including the bulge area of the Na[MASK]tong where the First Battle of Naktong Bulge had taken place earlier [MASK]n August . E[MASK]ch US infantry company on the river line here had a front of 3 @,@ 000 feet ( 910 m ) to 4 @,@ 000 feet ( 1 [MASK],@ 200 m ) and they held only key hills and observation points , as the units were extremely spread out along the wide front . 
 During the last week of August , US troops on these hills could see minor North Korean activity across the river , which they thought[MASK]was North Koreans organizing the high ground o[MASK] the west side of the Naktong agains[MASK] a poss[MASK]ble American attack . There were occasion[MASK]l attacks on th[MASK] 9th [MASK]nfantry 's for[MASK]ard positions , but to the men in the front lines this appeared to be only a standard p[MASK]trol action . On August 31 , the UN forces were alerted to a pending attack when much[MASK]of the Korean civilian labor force fled the front lines . Intelligence office[MASK]s reported an attack was coming . 
 On the west si[MASK]e of the Naktong , North Korean Major General Pak Kyo [MASK]am , commanding the NK 9th Div[MASK]sion , issued h[MASK]s operations order to the division on August 28 . Its mission in [MASK]he forthcoming attack was to outflank and destroy the US troops a[MASK] Naktong Bulge by capturing the Mi[MASK]yang and Samnangjin a[MASK]eas to cut off the US 2nd Division 's route of supply and withdrawal between Taegu and Pusan . However , the North Koreans [MASK]eren 't aware that the US 2nd Infantr[MASK] Division had recently replaced the US 24th Infantry [MASK]ivision in positions along the Naktong River . Consequently , they expected lighter resist[MASK]nce ; the 24th troops were exhausted from months of fighting but the 2nd Division men were fresh and newly arrived in Korea . They had only recently been moved into the lin[MASK] . The North Koreans began crossing the Naktong R[MASK]ver under cover of darkness at c[MASK]rtain points .

 On the southern @-@ most[MASK]flank of the 9th Infantry river line , just above t[MASK]e junction of the Nam River with the Naktong , A Company of the 1st Battalion was dug in on [MASK] long finger ridge parallel[MASK]ng the Naktong that terminat[MASK]s in Hill 94 at the Kihang ferry site . The river road from Namji @-@[MASK]ri run[MASK]ing west[MASK]along the Naktong passes[MASK]the southern tip of this ridge a[MASK]d crosses to the west side of the river at the ferry . A small village called Agok lay at the base[MASK]of Hill 94 and 300 yard[MASK] ( 27[MASK] m ) from the river . A patrol of tanks and armored vehicles , together with two infantry squads of A Company[MASK], 9th Infantry , held a roadblock near the ferry and close to Agok . [MASK]n the evening of August 31 , A Company moved from its ridge positions overlooking Agok and the river to new positions along the river below the r[MASK]dge line . 
 That evening Sergeant Er[MASK]est R. Kouma led the patrol of two M26[MASK]Pershing tanks and two M19 Gun Motor Carriages[MASK]in Agok . Kouma placed his patrol on the west side of Agok near the Kihang ferry . At 20 : 00 a heavy fog covered the river , and at 22 : 00 [MASK]ortar shells began f[MASK]lling on the American @-@ held side of[MASK]the[MASK]river . By 22 [MASK] 15 this strike intensified and North Korean mortar preparation struck A Company 's p[MASK]sitions . American mortars and artillery began firing counterbattery . Some of the A Company men reported they[MASK]heard noises[MASK]on the opposite [MASK]ide of the river and splashes in the water . 
 At 22 : 30 t[MASK]e fog lifted and Kouma saw th[MASK]t a North Korean pon[MASK]oon bridge was being laid across the river directly in front of his position . Kouma 's four vehicles attacked this structure , and after about a minute of heavy fire the bridge collapse[MASK] , and the ponton boats used to hold the bridge in place[MASK]were sunk . At 23 : 00 a small arms fight flared around the left side of A Company north [MASK]f the tanks . This gunfire had lasted[MASK]only tw[MASK] or three minutes when the A Company roadblock squads near the [MASK]anks[MASK]r[MASK]ceived word by field telephone that the company was withdrawing to the original ridge[MASK]positions and that they should do likewise . 
 Kouma 's patrol w[MASK]s then ambushed [MASK]y a group of Nor[MASK]h Koreans dressed in US military uniforms . Kouma was woun[MASK]ed and the other three vehicles had to withdraw , but he held the Agok site until 07 : 30 the next morni[MASK]g with his single tank . In the attack against A Company , the[MASK]North Koreans hit the 1st Platoon , which was near Agok , but they did not find [MASK]he 2nd Platoon northward . 
 The NK 9th Division 's infantry crossing of the Naktong and attack on[MASK]its east side near midnight quickly overran the positi[MASK]ns of C[MASK]Company , north of A Company . There the North Koreans assaulted in force , signaled by[MASK]green flares and blowing of whistles . The company held its positions only [MASK][MASK]short time [MASK]nd then attempted to esc[MASK]pe . Many of the men moved south , a few of them coming into A Company 's ridge l[MASK]ne positions near Agok during the night . Most of C Company moved all th[MASK] way to the 25th Division positions south of the Naktong . On September 1 that division repor[MASK]ed that 110 men of C Compa[MASK]y had come into [MASK]ts lines .

 Meanwhile , 5 [MASK]iles[MASK]( 8 @.@ 0 km ) north of Agok and A Company 's position , B Company , 9th Infantry , held a similar position on[MASK]Hill [MASK]09 overlooking the [MASK]aekchin ferry crossing of the river . This ferry was located at the middle of the Naktong Bulge where the Yongsan road ca[MASK]e[MASK]down to the [MASK]aktong and crossed it . The US 2nd Infant[MASK]y Division had planned a reconnaissance mission to start from there the night of August 31 , the same night that the NK I Corps [MASK]ffensive roll[MASK]d across the river . 
 Near the end of the month two reconnaissance patrols from the 9th Infantry had crossed to the west s[MASK]de of the Naktong and observed Nor[MASK]h Korean tank and troop a[MASK]tivity 2 miles ( 3 @.@ 2 km ) west of the river . Information obtained later indicated it was[MASK]in fact the command post of the NK 9th Division . On August 25 , 9th[MASK]Infantry commander Colonel John G. Hill outlined projected " Opera[MASK]ion Manchu , " which was to be a company @-@ [MASK]ized combat patrol to cross the river ,[MASK]advance to the suspected North Korean command post and communicat[MASK]ons center , destroy it , capture [MASK]risoners , and col[MASK]ect intelligence . 
 The 9th Infantry Regiment had planned Task Force Manchu on orders from the 2nd Division commander M[MASK]jor General Laurence B. Keiser , which[MASK]in turn had received instructions fr[MASK]m E[MASK]ghth United States Army commander Lieute[MASK]ant General Walton Walker for aggressive patrollin[MASK] .[MASK]Keiser decided the patrol should cross the river at the Paekchin ferry . T[MASK]e 9th Infantry reserve , E Company , reinforced with one section of light machine guns from H Company , was to be the atta[MASK]k force . The 1st Platoon [MASK] 2nd Engineer Combat Battalion , was to transport it across the river in assault boats the nigh[MASK] [MASK]f August 31 . Two heavy weapon[MASK] comp[MASK]nies , D and H , we[MASK]e each to furnish one section of heavy machine guns , one section of 81 @-@ mm. mor[MASK]ars , and one section of 75 @-@ mm. recoilless[MASK]rifle[MASK] [MASK]or supporting fires .[MASK]A platoon of 4 @.@ [MASK] @-@ in[MASK]h mortars was also to give support . 
 After dark on August 31 [MASK] First Lieutenant Charles I. Caldwell of D Company and First Lieutenant Edward Schmitt of [MASK] Company [MASK] 9th Infantry , moved their men and weapons to the base of Hill 209 , which was within B Company 's[MASK]defense sector and overlooked the Paekchin [MASK]erry crossing of the Naktong River . The raiding force , E[MASK][MASK]ompany , was still in its regimental reserve position about 2 miles ( 3 @.@ 2 km ) west of Yongsan , getting ready with the engineer platoon to move to the crossing site . Colonel Hill went forward in the evening with the 4 @.@ 2 @-@ inch mortar platoon to its position a[MASK] the base of Hil[MASK] 209 where the mortarmen prepared to set up their weapons . 
 By 21 : 00 , the clo[MASK]est front line unit was B Co[MASK]pany[MASK]on top of Hill 209 , 1 mile ( 1 @.@ 6 km ) north of the river road which curved around the hill 's southern base . The re[MASK]imental chaplain , Captain Lewis B. Sheen , had gone for[MASK]ard in t[MASK]e afternoon to B Company[MASK]to hold [MASK]ervi[MASK]es . On to[MASK] of Hill 20[MASK] , Cha[MASK]lain Sheen and men in B C[MASK]mpany after dark heard splashing in the water below them . They soon d[MASK]scovered a long line of North Korean so[MASK]di[MASK]rs wading the river . 
 The first North Korean crossing at the Paekchin ferry caught the Heavy Mortar Platoon unprepared in the act of setting up its weapons . It also caught most of the D and H Company men at th[MASK] base of Hill 209 , .5 miles ( 0 @.@ 80 km ) from the crossing site . The[MASK]N[MASK]rth Koreans killed or captured [MASK]any of the troops there . Hill was there , but escaped to the re[MASK]r just before[MASK]midnight , together with several others , when the division cance[MASK]ed Operation Manchu because of the attacks [MASK] The first heavy weapons carrying party was on its way up the hill when the North Korean attack engulfed the men below . It hurried [MASK]n to t[MASK]e top[MASK]whe[MASK]e the advance group waited and there all h[MASK][MASK]tily dug in on a small perimeter . This [MASK]roup was not attacked during the night . 
 From 21 : 30 until shortly after[MASK]midnight the NK 9th Di[MASK]ision crossed the Naktong at a number of places and cli[MASK]bed the hills quietly toward the 9th Infantry river line p[MASK]sition[MASK] .[MASK]Then , when the artillery barrage pr[MASK]paration lifted , the North Korean infantry were in posi[MASK]ion to launch their assaults . These began in the northern part of the [MASK]egimental sector and quickly spread southward . At each c[MASK]ossing site the North Koreans wou[MASK]d ove[MASK]whelm local UN defenders before building pontoon bridges for thei[MASK] vehicles and armor . 
 At 02 : 00 , B Company was attacked . A truck stopped a[MASK] the bo[MASK]tom of[MASK]the hill , a whi[MASK]tle sounded , then came a shoute[MASK] order , and North Korean s[MASK]ldiers started climbing the slope . The hills on both sides of B Company were already under attack as was also Hill 311 , a rugged terrain feature a 1 @.@ 5 miles ( 2 @.@ 4 km ) from the river and the North Koreans [MASK][MASK]principal immediate objecti[MASK]e . The North Koreans apparently were not aware of the Task Force[MASK]Manchu group lower down on the hill and it was not attacked during[MASK]the night . But[MASK]hig[MASK]er up on Hill 209 the North Koreans drove B Comp[MASK]ny from its position , inflicting very heavy casualties on [MASK]t . Sheen led one group of soldiers back to friendly[MASK]lines on 4 September . 
 At 03 : 00 , 1 September , the 9th Infantry Regiment ordered its only reserve , E Co[MASK]pany to move west along the Yongsan @-@ Naktong River road and take a blocking position at the p[MASK]ss between Cloverleaf Hill and Obong @-@ ni Ridge , 3[MASK]miles ( 4 @.@ 8 km ) from the river and 6 miles ( 9 @.@ [MASK] km [MASK] f[MASK]om Yongsan . This was the critical terrain where so much heavy fighting had taken [MASK]lace in the first battle of [MASK]he Naktong Bulge . Fighting began at the pass at 02 : 30 when an American medium tank of A Company , 72nd Tank Battalion , knocked out a T @-@ 34 at Tugok , also called Morisil . E Company never reached its blocking position . A strong North Korean force surprised and delivered heavy automatic fire on it at 03 : 30 from positions astride the[MASK]road ea[MASK]t of the pass . The company suffered heavy casualties , including the company commander and Keiser '[MASK] [MASK]ide who had accompanied th[MASK] force . With t[MASK]e critical parts of Cloverleaf Hill and Obong @-@ ni Ridge , the best defensive terrain between Yongs[MASK]n and the ri[MASK]er , the North Koreans control[MASK]ed the high g[MASK]ound . The US 2nd Infa[MASK]try Division now had to base its defense of Yongsan on relatively poor defensive terrain , the low hills at the western edge of the town .

 North of the 9th Infantry sector of the 2nd Infantry Division front along the Naktong , the US 23rd Infantry Regiment on August 29 had just relieved the 3rd Battalion of the US 38th Infantry Regiment , which [MASK]n turn had only a few days before relieved the US 21st Infan[MASK]ry Regiment of the US 24th Infantry Division . On August 1 ,[MASK]the 23rd Regiment was in a new sector of which it ha[MASK] [MASK]nly a limited knowledge [MASK] It took over a 16 [MASK],@ 000 yards ( 15 @,@ 000 m ) Nakton[MASK] River front without its 3r[MASK] Battalion which had been attached to the US 1st Cavalry Division to the north . Colonel Paul L. Freeman , the regiment[MASK]l commander , deployed the 1st Battalion on the high ground along the rive[MASK] with the three companies abreast . The 1st Battalion , under US Lieutenant Colonel Claire E. Hutchin , Jr . , [MASK]utposted the hills with platoons and squa[MASK]s . He placed the[MASK]2nd Ba[MASK]talion in a reserve position 8 miles ( 13 km ) beh[MASK]nd the 1st Battalion and in a position where it com[MASK]anded the road net in the regimental sector[MASK]. On August 31h the 2nd Division moved E Company south to a reserve position in the 9th Infantry[MASK]sector . 
 Two road[MASK] ran through the regimental sector from the Naktong River to Changnyong . The main road bent south along t[MASK]e east bank of the river to Pugong @-@ ni and then turned n[MASK]rtheast to Changnyong . A northern secondary road cu[MASK]ved around marshland and lakes , the largest of which [MASK]as Lake U @-@[MASK]p 'o , to Changnyong . In effect , the 1st[MASK]Battalion of the 23rd Regiment guarded these two approach routes to Changnyong . 
 The 42 men of the 2nd P[MASK]atoon , B Company , 23rd Infantry held outpost[MASK]pos[MASK]tions on seven hills [MASK]overing a 2 @,@ 600 yards ( 2 @,@ 400 m ) front along the ea[MASK]t bank of the Naktong [MASK]orth of Pugong @-@ ni . Acr[MASK]ss the river in the r[MASK]ce paddies they could see , in the afternoon of A[MASK]gust 31 ,[MASK]two [MASK]arge groups of North Korean soldier[MASK] . Occasionally artillery fire disperse[MASK] them . Just before dark , the platoon saw a column of North Koreans come[MASK]out of the hills and proceed to[MASK]ard the river . They immediat[MASK]ly reported to the battalion comma[MASK]d post . The artillery forward ob[MASK]erver , who estimated the column at 2 @,@ 000 people , thought they were refugees . Freeman immediately ordered the arti[MASK]lery to fire o[MASK] the column , re[MASK]ucing its number . However the North K[MASK]reans continued[MASK]their advance . 
 At 21 : 00 the fi[MASK]st shells of what proved to be a two @-@ hour North Korean ar[MASK]illery and mortar pr[MASK]paration against the Ameri[MASK]a[MASK] river positions of 2nd Platoon . As the barrage rolled on[MASK], North Kore[MASK]n infantry crossed the river and[MASK]c[MASK]imbed the hills in the darkness under cover of its fire . At 23 : 00 the barrage l[MASK]fted and the North Koreans attacked 2nd Platoon , forci[MASK]g it from the hill after[MASK]a short fight . Similar a[MASK]saults took [MASK]lace elsewhere along the [MASK]attali[MASK]n outpost line . 
 On the regimental left along the main Pugong @-@ ni @-@ Changnyong road North Kore[MASK]n soldiers completely overran C Company by 0300 September 1 . Only seven men of C Company could be accounted for , and three days later , after all the stragglers and those cut o[MASK]f behind North Korean lines had come in , there wer[MASK] only 20 men in the company . As the North Korean [MASK]ttack developed du[MASK]in[MASK] the night , 1st Battalion succeeded in withdrawing a large part of i[MASK]s force , less C Company , just north of Lake U @-@ p 'o[MASK]and the hills there covering the northern road into Changnyong , 3 miles ( 4 @.@ 8 km ) east of the ri[MASK]er a[MASK]d 5 miles ( 8 @.@ 0 km ) wes[MASK] of the town . B Company lost heavily in this action . 
 When word of[MASK]the disaster that had overtaken 1st Battalion reached regimental headquarters[MASK], Freeman obtained the release of G and F Companies from 2nd Division reserve and s[MASK]nt [MASK]he former to help 1st Battalion and the latter on the southern road toward Pugong @-@ [MASK]i and C Com[MASK]any . Major Lloyd K. Jenson , executive officer of the 2nd Battalion , accompanied F Company down the Pugong @-@ ni road . This [MASK]orce was unable to reach C Company , but Jenson collec[MASK]ed stragglers from it and seized high ground astride this main a[MASK]proach to Changnyong near Ponch 'o @-@ ri above Lake Sanorho , an[MASK] went into a defensive p[MASK]sition there . The US 2nd Division released E Compa[MASK]y to the regiment[MASK]and the next day it joined F Company to [MASK]uil[MASK] up what became the[MASK]main defensive position of the 23d[MASK]Regiment in fr[MASK]nt of Changnyong [MASK] North Korean troops during the n[MASK]ght [MASK]assed around the right flank of 1st Battalion 's norther[MASK] blo[MASK]king position and reached the road three miles behind him near the division artillery positions . The 23rd Infantry Headquarters and Service Companies and other miscellaneous regimental units fin[MASK]lly stopped thi[MASK] pen[MASK]tration near the regimental command post 5 miles ( 8 @.[MASK] 0 [MASK]m ) northwest of Changnyong .

 Before the mornin[MASK] of 1 September h[MASK]d passed , reports coming in to US 2nd Division headquarters made it clear that North Koreans had penetrated [MASK]o the no[MASK]th @-@ south Changnyong @-@ Yongsan road and cu[MASK] the division in two ; the 38th and 2[MASK]d Infantry Regiments with the bulk of the division artillery in the north were separated from the division headquarters and the 9th Infantry Regiment in the south . Keiser decided that this situation made it advisable to control and direct the divided division as two special forces . Accordingly , he placed the division artillery commander , Brigadier General Loyal M. Haynes , in command of the northern group . Haynes ' command post was 7 miles ( 11 km )[MASK]north of Changnyong . Task Forc[MASK] Haynes became operational at 10 : 20 , Septe[MASK]be[MASK] 1 . So[MASK]thwa[MASK]d , in the Yongsan area , Keiser placed Brigadier General[MASK]Joseph S. Bradley , Assistant Division Commander , in char[MASK]e of th[MASK] 9th Infantry Regiment , the 2nd Engineer Combat Battalion , most of the 72nd Tank Battalion , and other miscellaneous u[MASK]its of the [MASK]ivision . This southern grouping was known as Ta[MASK]k Force Bradley . 
 All three regiments of the NK 2nd Division @-@ the 4th , [MASK]7th , and 6th , in line from north to south @-@ cross[MASK]d during the night to th[MASK] east side of [MASK]he Naktong River into [MASK]he 23rd Regiment sector . The NK 2n[MASK] Divisi[MASK]n , concentrated in th[MASK] Sinban @-@ ni area west of the river , [MASK]ad , in effect , att[MASK]cked s[MASK]raight east across the river a[MASK]d was trying to seize the two avenues of [MASK]dvance into Changnyong above and belo[MASK] Lake U @-@ p 'o . On August 31 , 1950 , Lake [MASK] @-@ p 'o was a large body of wat[MASK]r although in most places very shallow . 
 At dawn September 1 , Keiser at 2nd Division headqua[MASK]ters in Muan @-@ ni , 7 miles ( 11 km ) east of Yongsan on the Miryang road , [MASK]elt h[MASK]s division was in the midst of a c[MASK]isis . The massive North Korean attack had made deep penetra[MASK]ions everywhere in the division sector except in the no[MASK]th in the zone of the 38th Infantry . The NK 9th Division [MASK]ad effected major crossings of the Naktong at two principal points against the US[MASK]9th Infantry ; the NK 2nd Division in the meantime had made three major crossings against the US 23rd Infantry ; and [MASK]he NK 10th Division had begun crossing more troops i[MASK] the Hill 409 area near Hyongp 'ung in the US 38th Infantry sector . At 08 : 10 Kei[MASK]er telephoned Eighth Army headquarters and reported the heaviest and deepest North Korean penetrations were in th[MASK] 9th Infantry sector . 
 Liaison planes rose from the division strip every hour to observe the North Korean progress and t[MASK] locate US 2nd Infantry Division front @-@ line units . Communication from division and [MASK]egimental headquarters to nearly all the forward uni[MASK]s was broken . Beginning at 09 : 30 and continuing throughout the rest of the day , the light a[MASK]iation section of the divisio[MASK] artil[MASK]ery located front @-@ line units cut off by the North Koreans , and made [MASK]ourteen airdrops [MASK]f ammunition , food , wate[MASK] , and medical supplies . As informa[MASK]ion sl[MASK]wly built up at division headquarters it became apparent that the North Koreans had punched a ho[MASK]e 6 miles ( 9 @.@ 7 km ) wide and 8 miles ( 13 km ) deep in the middle[MASK]of the division lin[MASK] and made [MASK]ess severe penetrations elsewhere . The front @-@ line battalions of the US 9th and 23rd Regiments were in various states of disorganization and some companies had virtually disappeare[MASK] . Keiser hoped he co[MASK]ld organize a defense along [MASK]he Changnyong @-@ Yongsan road east of the Naktong River , and prevent North Korean access to the passes eastward leading to Miryang and Ch 'ongdo .

 At 09 : 00 Walker requ[MASK]sted the US Air Force t[MASK] make a maximum effort along the Naktong River from Toksong @-@ dong , just above the US 2nd Division boundary , southward a[MASK]d to a d[MASK]pth of 15 mile[MASK] ( 24 km ) wes[MASK] of the river . He wan[MASK]ed the Air Force to isolate the battlefield and prevent further North Korean reinfor[MASK]ements and supplies[MASK]from moving across the river[MASK]in support of the North Korean spearhead units . The Far East Command requested the US Na[MASK]y to join in the air effort , and the US Seventh Fleet turned back from [MASK]ts strikes in[MASK]the Inch 'on @-@ Seoul area and sped southward at full st[MASK]am toward the southern battle front . Walk[MASK]r came to the US 2nd Division front at 12 : 00[MASK]and ordered the division to hold at all costs . He had already ordered groun[MASK] reinfor[MASK]ements to the Yongsan area . 
 During the morning of 1 Septe[MASK]ber , Wal[MASK]er weigh[MASK]d the news coming in from his southern front , wavering in [MASK] decision as to which part of the f[MASK]ont most needed his Pusan Perimeter reserves . Since midnight the NK I Corps had broken his Pusan Perimeter in two places @-@ the NK 2nd a[MASK]d 9th Divisions in the US 2nd Division sector , and the NK 7th Division and NK 6th Division in the US 25th Divi[MASK]io[MASK] sector , be[MASK]ow the junction of the Nam and Naktong Rivers . In the US 2nd Division sector North Korean troops were at the edge of Yongsan , the gateway to the corridor lead[MASK]ng 12 [MASK]iles ( 19 km ) eastward to Miryang and the main Pus[MASK]n @-@ Mukden railroad and h[MASK]ghway . 
 Eighth Army had in[MASK]reserve three understrength infantry regiments a[MASK]d th[MASK] 2 @-@ battalion British 27th Infantry Bri[MASK]ade which was not yet [MASK]ompletely equi[MASK]ped an[MASK] ready to be placed in line : The 1st Provisional Marine Brigade at Changwon , 6 miles ( 9 @.@ 7 km ) northeast of Masan , preparing for movement to the port of[MASK]Pusan ; the[MASK]US 27th Infantry Regiment of the 25th Division which had arrived at Masan only the night before at 20 : 30 to relieve the 5th Regimental Combat Team , which was then to join t[MASK]e 24th D[MASK]vision in the Taegu [MASK]rea ; and the US 19th Infantry Regiment of the US 24th Infantry Division , then with that division 's headquarters at Kyongsan southeast of Taegu . Walker[MASK]alerted both the 24th Division hea[MASK]quarters , tog[MASK]ther with its 19th Regiment , and the 1st Provisional Marine Brigade to move at a moment [MASK]s notice ; the 24th Division [MASK]ither to the 2nd or 25th Division fronts , and the marines to an unannounced destination . 
 As the morning passed , General Walker decided that the situation[MASK]was most critical in the Naktong Bulge area of the US 2[MASK]d Divisio[MASK] sect[MASK][MASK] . There the North Koreans threatened Miryang and with[MASK]it the entire Eig[MASK]th Army position . At 11 : 00 Walker or[MASK]ered US Mar[MASK]ne Corps Brigadier General Edward A. Craig , commanding the[MASK]1st Provisional Marine Brigade , to prepare the marines to move at once . The marines made ready to depart for t[MASK]e Naktong Bulge at 13 : 30 . 
 
 [MASK] = = North Korean ad[MASK]ance = = = [MASK] 
 The situation on the front was[MASK]chaotic du[MASK]i[MASK]g the day September 1 . The North Koreans at one place had crossed[MASK]at the Kihang ferry , captured Agok ,[MASK]and sc[MASK]ttered A Company , 9th Infantry at i[MASK]s positions from Agok northward . A Company[MASK]withdrew to positions on the ridge line back [MASK]f the river . From there at daylight the men could see North Korean soldiers on many of the ridge[MASK] surrounding them , m[MASK]st of them moving east . Af[MASK]er several hours [MASK] 2nd Platoon of A Company sen[MASK] a patrol down the hill to Agok to obtain supplies abandoned t[MASK]ere during the night , returning later with much needed water , ra[MASK]ions , and ammunition . 
 Later in the morning North Korean barges crossed the Nakto[MASK]g below A Company . The[MASK]company sent[MASK]a [MASK]quad with a [MASK]ight machine gun to the southern tip of the ridge overlooking A[MASK]ok to take these troops under fire . When the squad [MASK]eached the tip of t[MASK]e ridge they saw that a North Korean force occupied houses at its base . The company hit these houses with artillery . The North Koreans broke from the houses , running for the river . At this the light machine[MASK]gun at the tip of the ridg[MASK] took them under [MASK]ire , as did another across the Naktong to the south in the US 25th In[MASK]antry Division sector . Pro[MASK]imity fuze artillery fire decimated th[MASK]s group . Combined fire from all weapons inflicted an estimated 3[MASK]0 casualties on this North Korean force . In the afternoon [MASK] US aircraft dropped food and ammunition to the c[MASK]mpa[MASK]y ; only part of it was recovered . The 1st Battalion order[MASK]d A Company to withdraw the[MASK]company that night . 
 During the withdraw , howev[MASK]r , A Company ran into a sizabl[MASK] North Korean[MASK]force an[MASK] had scattered in the ensuing fig[MASK]t . Most of the company , including its commander were killed at close range . In this des[MASK]erate action , Private First[MASK]Class Luther H. Story[MASK], a weapons squad leader , fought so tenaci[MASK]usly that he was awarded the Medal of Honor . Badly wound[MASK]d[MASK], Story refused to be a burden to those who might[MASK]escape [MASK] and when last se[MASK]n was still e[MASK]gaging North Korean at close range . Of those in the company , approximatel[MASK] ten men escaped to friendly lines . The next morning , under heavy fog , the group m[MASK]de its way by comp[MASK]ss toward Yongsan[MASK]. Fro[MASK] a hill at 12 : 00 , [MASK]fter the fog had[MASK]lifted , the men [MASK]ooked do[MASK]n on[MASK]the Battle of Y[MASK]ngsan which was then in progress . That afternoon 20 su[MASK]vivors of the company merged into the lines of th[MASK] 72nd Tank Battalion near Yongsan . Stragglers from this position continued to stream in the next few days as well . 
 
 = = = The end of Task Force Manchu[MASK]= = = 
 
 In the meantime[MASK], Task Force Manchu was still holding its position along the Naktong River , about 5[MASK]miles ( 8 @.@ 0 km ) nor[MASK]h of where A Company had been destro[MASK]ed on the southern end of the line . The perimeter position taken by the men of D and H Companies , 9th Infantry , who had starte[MASK] up the hill before the North Koreans struck , was on a southern knob of Hill 2[MASK]9 , 0 @.@ 5[MASK]miles ( 0 @.@ 80 km ) south of B Company 's higher p[MASK]siti[MASK]n . In addition to the D and H Company m[MASK]n , there were a few from the Heavy Mortar Platoon and one or two from B C[MASK]mpany . Altoget[MASK]er , 60 to 70 men were in the group . The[MASK]group had an [MASK]CR [MASK]-@ 300 radio [MASK] a heavy machine gun , two light machine gun , a M1918 Browning Au[MASK]omatic Rifle , about 20 M1 Garand rifles , and about 40 carbines or pistols . [MASK]chmitt assumed command of the group . 
 During the night Sch[MASK]itt established radio communication with the 1st Battalion , 9th infantry . When daylight came S[MASK]hmitt and his group saw that they were surrounded by North Koreans . One for[MASK]e occupied[MASK]the higher kn[MASK]b half a mile above them , forme[MASK]ly held by B Company . Below them , North Koreans co[MASK]tinued crossing the river and moving supplies forward to their comb[MASK]t units , som[MASK] of them already several miles eastward . The North Koreans quickly discov[MASK]red Task Force Manchu group[MASK]. They first attacked it at 14 : 00 that afternoon , and were repulsed [MASK] That night[MASK]an estimated company attacked three times , pressing t[MASK]e fight to close quarters , but failed e[MASK]ch time to penetrate the tight US perimeter . Daylight of the second day disclosed many North Korean dead o[MASK] t[MASK]e steep slopes outside t[MASK]e[MASK]perimeter . 
 In the afternoon of September 2 Schmitt radioed 1st Battali[MASK]n for an airdrop of supplies . A US plane attem[MASK]ted the drop , but the perimeter was so small and the slope[MASK] so steep that virtually all the supplies went into North Korean hands . [MASK]he men in the pe[MASK]imeter did , however , recover from a drop made later at 19 :[MASK]00 some supplies and ammunition . Private First[MASK]Class Joseph R. Ouellette , of H Company , left the perimeter to gath[MASK]r weapons , ammunition , and[MASK]gr[MASK]nades from the North Korean dead . On sev[MASK]ral occasions he was attacked , and on one such occasion a North Korean soldier suddenly attacked Oue[MASK]lette , who killed the North Korean in hand @-@ to @-@ hand combat . [MASK] That same afternoon , the North Korea[MASK]s sent an American pris[MASK]ner up the hill to Schmitt with the message , " You have one hour to surrender or be blown to p[MASK]eces . " Failing in frontal infantry attack to reduce th[MASK] little defending force , the North Koreans now meant to take it under mortar fire . On[MASK]y 45 minutes la[MASK]er North Korean antitank fire came in on the[MASK]knob and two machine guns from positions northward and higher on the slope of Hill 209 swept the perimeter . Soon , mort[MASK]rs emplaced on a neighboring high finger ridge eastward registered on Schmitt 's perimete[MASK] a[MASK]d continued firing until dark [MASK] The machine gun fire forced every man to stay in his foxhole . The[MASK]lifti[MASK]g of the mortar fire aft[MASK]r dark was the sig[MASK]al[MASK]for renewed North Korean infantry attacks , all of which were repulsed . But the number of killed and[MASK]wounded[MASK]within the perimeter was growing [MASK] and supplies were diminishing . There were no medica[MASK] supplies except those carried [MASK]y one aid man . 
 The third day , September 3 , the situation worsened . The weather was hot and ammunition , food and supplies were [MASK]early complete[MASK]y exhausted . Since the previous aftern[MASK]on , North Korean morta[MASK] barrages [MASK]ad alternated with in[MASK]antry assaults against the perimeter . Survivors later estimated there were abo[MASK]t twenty separate infantry attack[MASK] repulsed . Two North Korean machine guns still swept the perimeter whenever anyone showed himself . Dead and dying US troops were in al[MASK]ost every foxhole . Mortar fragments destroyed the radio and this ended all communication with other US units [MASK] Artillery fire and [MASK]ir[MASK]strikes requested by Schmitt never came . Some North Koreans worked their way close to the perimeter and threw grenades into it . Six times[MASK]Ouellette leaped from his foxhole to escape[MASK]grenades thrown into it . In this close action Ouellette was killed . Most of the foxholes of the perimeter received[MASK]one or more direct mortar hits in the cou[MASK]se of the continuing mortar fire . One of these killed Schmitt on September 3 . The command passed now to First Lieutenant Raymond J. McDoniel of D Company , senior surviving officer . 
 At daylight on the morning of [MASK] September on[MASK]y two officers and approximately half the men who h[MASK]d[MASK]assembled on the hill , were alive [MASK] As the day passed , with ammunition down to a[MASK]out one clip[MASK]per man and only a few grenades left and no help in sight , McDoniel decided to aba[MASK]don the position that n[MASK]ght . When it got dark t[MASK]e survivors would split into small group[MASK] and try to get back to frien[MASK]l[MASK] lines . That evening after dark the North Koreans launched [MASK]nother wea[MASK] attack against the position . At 22 : 00 , McDoniel and Caldwell and 27 e[MASK]listed men slipped off the hill in groups of four . Master Sergeant Travis E. Watkins , still alive in his[MASK]paralyzed condition , refused efforts of evacuation , [MASK]a[MASK]ing that he did not want to be a burden to those who had a chance to get away . He asked only [MASK]hat his carbine be loaded and pl[MASK]ced on his chest with the muzzle under his chin . Like Oullette , he would also win the Medal of Honor for his actions . Of the 29 men who came off the hill[MASK]the night of September 4 , 22 escaped to friendly lines , many of them following the Naktong downstream , hiding by day and traveling by night , until they reached the[MASK]lines of the US 25th Infantry Division . 
 Members of[MASK]Task Force Manchu who escaped from Hill 20[MASK] brought back considerable intel[MASK]igence information of North Korean activity in th[MASK] vicinity of the Paekchin ferry crossing site . At the ferry site the North Koreans had put in an underwater bridge . A short distance downstream , each night they placed a ponto[MASK]n bridge across the river and t[MASK][MASK]k it up bef[MASK]re dawn the next morning . Car[MASK]ying parties of 50 civilians guarded by four North Korean soldiers [MASK]rossed the river continuously at night , an estimated total of 800 @-@ 1 @,@ 000 carriers being used at this crossing site .

 North of t[MASK]e US 9th Infantry and the battles[MASK]in t[MASK]e Nakton[MASK] Bulge and around Yongsan , the US 23d Infantry Regiment after [MASK]aylight of Septemb[MASK]r 1 was in a very precarious pos[MASK]tion . Its 1st Battalion had been driven from the river positions and isolated 3 mi[MASK]es ( 4 @.@ 8 km ) westward . Approximately 400 North Koreans now overran the regimental command post , compelling Freeman to wit[MASK]draw it about 600[MASK]yards ( 550 m ) . There , 5 miles ( 8 @.@ 0 km ) northwest of Changnyong , the US 23rd Infantry Headquarters and Headquarters Company , miscellaneous regimental uni[MASK]s [MASK] and regimental staff officers c[MASK]ecked the North Koreans i[MASK] a 3 @-@ hour fight . 
 The[MASK]North Koreans advanced to Changnyong itself during the a[MASK]ternoon of September 2 , and ROK National Police withdrew from the town . North Korea[MASK]s we[MASK]e[MASK]in Changn[MASK]ong that evening . W[MASK]th his communications broken southward to the 2nd Infan[MASK]ry Division headquarters and the 9th Infantry , Haynes dur[MASK]ng the day decided to send a tank patrol down the Yongsan road [MASK]n an effort to re @-@ establish[MASK]communication . C Company , 72nd Tank Battalion , led its tanks southward . They had to fight their way down the road through[MASK]several roadblocks . Of the three tanks that started ,[MASK]only the lead tank got through to Yongsan . There , it de[MASK]ivered an overlay of Task Force Haynes ' p[MASK]sitions to Bradley . 
 Still farther northward in the zone of[MASK]the US 38th Infantry the N[MASK]rth Koreans were also active . After the North Korean b[MASK]eakthrough during the night o[MASK] August 31 , Keiser had o[MASK]dered the 2nd Battalio[MASK] , [MASK]8th Infantry , to move south and help the 23rd Infantry es[MASK]ablish a defensive position west of Changn[MASK]ong . In at[MASK]empting to do this , the battalion found North Korean troops already on the ridges along the [MASK]oad . They had penetrated to Hill 284 overlooking the 38th Infantry command post . This hill and Hill 209 dominated the rear areas of the regiment . At 06 : 00 September 3 , 300 North Kor[MASK]ans launched an attack from Hill 284 against the 38th Regiment command post . The regimental commander organized a defensive perimeter and requested a bombing strike which was denie[MASK] him because t[MASK]e enemy target and h[MASK]s defense perimeter were too close to each other . But the Air Force di[MASK] deliver rocket and strafing strikes[MASK]. 
 This[MASK]fight continued until September 5 . On that day F Company captured Hill 284 killing 150 North Koreans . From[MASK]the crest he and his men watched as many more North Koreans ran into a village below them . Directed artil[MASK]ery fire destroyed the village . Among the abandoned Nort[MASK] Korean ma[MASK]eriel on the hill , [MASK]chauer 's[MASK]men found [MASK]wenty @-[MASK][MASK][MASK]ive Ameri[MASK]an [MASK]ARs and submachine guns , a large American ra[MASK]io , thirty boxes of unopened American fragmentation and concussion grenades , and[MASK]some American [MASK]ations .

 Meanwhile , during these actions in its rear , the 1st Battalion , 23rd Infantry , was cut off 3 miles ( 4 @.@ 8 km ) west of the nearest friendly units . On September 1 the regiment ordered it to wit[MASK]draw to[MASK]the Changnyong area . At 14 : 00 a tank @-[MASK] infantry patrol was sent down [MASK]he road , but it[MASK]reported that an estimated North Korean batta[MASK]ion hel[MASK] the mountain pass just eastward of the batt[MASK]lion 's defense perimeter . Upon receiving this report the battalion c[MASK]mmander requested permission by radio to remain in his present position [MASK]nd try to obstruct the movement of No[MASK]th Korean reinforcements and supplies . Th[MASK]t evening Freeman approved this request , and 1st Battalion spent three days in the isolated positions . During this time C @-@ 47 Skytrain plane[MASK] supplied the battalion by airdrops[MASK]. 
 On the mor[MASK]ing of September 1 , 3rd Battalion , 38th Infantry moved in an attack westward from the 23rd Regim[MASK]nt command post near Mosa[MASK] @-@ ni to open the road to the 1s[MASK] Battalion . On the second day of the fighting at the pass ,[MASK]the relief force broke through the roadblock with the help of air strikes and artillery and tank fire . [MASK]he advanced elements of the battalion joined 1st Battalion at 17 : 00 Septembe[MASK] 2 . That evening , North Koreans strongly attacked the 3rd Battalion , 38th Infantry , on Hill 209 north of the road and opposite 1st Battali[MASK]n , driving one company from its position . 
 On September 4 , Haynes changed the [MASK]oundary between the 3[MASK]th and 23rd Infantry Regime[MASK]ts [MASK] giving the nor[MASK]hern part of the 23rd 's se[MASK]tor to the 38th Infantry , thus releasing[MASK]1st Battalion for movement southward to h[MASK]lp the 2nd Battalion defend the southern approach to Cha[MASK]gnyong . The 1st Battalion , 23r[MASK] Infantry , about 1 @,@ 100 men strong when the attack began , was now down to a strength of approximately 600 men . The 23[MASK]d Infantry[MASK]now made plans to concentrate all its troo[MASK]s on th[MASK] position held by its 2nd Battalion on the Pugong @-@ ni @-[MASK] Changnyong road . The 1st Battal[MASK]on moved there and took a place o[MASK] the left flank of the 2nd Battalion . At the sa[MASK]e time the regimental command post moved to the [MASK]ear [MASK]f this position . In this regimenta[MASK] perime[MASK]er , the 23rd Inf[MASK]ntry [MASK]ought a serie[MASK] of hard[MASK]battles . Simultaneously it had to se[MASK]d combat patrols to its [MASK]ear to clear infiltrating North Koreans f[MASK]om Changnyong and from [MASK]ts supply road . 
 
 = = = Battle [MASK]f Yongsan = = = 
 
 On the morning of September 1 the 1st and 2nd Regiments of the NK 9th Division , in their first offensive of the war , stood only a f[MASK]w m[MASK]les short of Yongsan after a successful river [MASK]rossing and penetration of[MASK]the American line . Th[MASK] 3rd Regiment had been le[MASK]t at Inch 'on , but division commander Major General Pak Kyo Sam felt the chances of capturing Yongsan were strong . 
 O[MASK] the morning of September 1 , with only t[MASK]e[MASK]shattered remnants of E Company at hand , th[MASK] US 9th Infantry Regiment , US 2nd Infantry Division had virtually no troops to defend Yongsan . Keiser in this emergency attached the 2nd Engineer Combat Battalion to the reg[MASK]ment . The US 72nd Tank Battalion and the 2nd Division Reconnaissance Company also were a[MASK]signed positions close to Yongsan[MASK]. The regimental commander planned to[MASK]place the engineers on the chain of low hills that arched around Yo[MASK]gsan on the northwest . 
 A Company , 2nd Engineer[MASK]Comb[MASK]t Battalion , moved to the south side of the Yongsa[MASK] @-@ Naktong River road ; D Com[MASK]any of the 2nd En[MASK]ineer Battalion was on the north side of the road . Approximately 2 miles ( 3 @.@ [MASK] km ) west of Yongsan an est[MASK]mated 300 North Korean troops engaged A Company in a fire fight . M19 Gun Moto[MASK] Carriages of the 82nd AAA Battalion supported the engineers in this action , which lasted several hours . Meanwhile , with the appro[MASK]al [MASK]f General Bradley , D Company moved t[MASK] the hill immediately[MASK]south of and overlooking Yongsan . A platoon of infantry went into po[MASK]ition behind it . A Company was now ordered to fall back to the southeast edge of Yongsan on the left flank [MASK]f D Company . There , A Comp[MASK]ny went [MASK]n[MASK]o position along the road ; on its left[MASK]was C Company of the Engineer battalion , and beyond C Company was the 2nd Division Reconnaissance Company . The hill occupied [MASK]y D[MASK]Company was in reality th[MASK] western tip of a large mountain mass that lay southeast of the town . The road to Miryang came south out of Yongsan , bent around the western tip of t[MASK]is mountain , and then ran eastward along its southern base . In its position , D Company not only commanded the town but also its exit , the road to Miryang . 
 North Koreans had also approa[MASK]hed Yongsan fr[MASK][MASK] the south . The US 2nd Divis[MASK]on Reconn[MASK]issance Company and tanks of the 72nd Tank Battalion opposed[MASK]them in a sharp fight . In thi[MASK] a[MASK]tion , Sergeant First Class Charles W. Turner of the Reconna[MASK]ssance Compa[MASK]y particularly disting[MASK]ished himself . [MASK]e [MASK]ounted a tank , operated its exposed turret machine gun , and directed tank fire which reportedly destroyed seven North Korea[MASK] machine guns . Turner and[MASK]this tank came under heavy North Korean f[MASK]re which shot away the tank 's periscope and antennae and scored more than 50 hits on [MASK]t . Turner , although wounded , remained on the tank until he was killed . That night North Korean soldiers crossed the low ground a[MASK]ound Yongsan and entered the town from the south . 
 At 09 : 35 Septembe[MASK] 2 , while the North Koreans were attempting to destroy the engineer troops at the southern [MASK]dge of Yongsan and clear the road to Miryang , Walker spoke b[MASK] telephone with M[MASK]jor General Doyle O. Hickey , Deputy Chief of Staff , Far East Command in Tokyo . He described the situation around the[MASK]Perimeter and said the most seri[MASK]us threat was along the bo[MASK]ndary[MASK]between the US 2nd and US 25th In[MASK]antry [MASK]ivi[MASK]ions . He described the location of his reserve [MASK]orces and his plans for using them . He s[MASK]id he had started the 1st Provision[MASK]l Marine Brigad[MASK] toward Yongsan but had not yet released them for commitme[MASK]t there and he wanted to be sure that General of the Army Douglas MacArthur approved his use [MASK]f [MASK]hem , [MASK]ince he knew tha[MASK] this would interfere with other plans of the Fa[MASK] East Command . Walker said he did not think he could restore the 2nd Div[MASK]sion lines without using them . Hickey replied t[MASK]at MacArthur had th[MASK] day bef[MASK]re ap[MASK]roved the use of the US Marines if and when Walker considered it necessary . A few hours after th[MASK]s conversa[MASK]ion Walker , at 13 : 15 , attached the 1st Provisional Marine Bri[MASK]ade to the US 2nd [MASK]ivision and ordered[MASK]a c[MASK] @-@ ordinated attack by all available elements of the division and the m[MASK]rines , with the mission of destroying the North Koreans east of the N[MASK]ktong River in the 2n[MASK][MASK]Division sector and of restoring the river line . The marines w[MASK]re to be relea[MASK]ed from 2nd D[MASK]visi[MASK]n c[MASK]ntrol as soon as this mission was accomplished . 
 A decision was r[MASK]ached [MASK]hat the marines would attack west at 08 : 00 on September 3 astride the [MASK]ongsan[MASK]@-@ Naktong River road ; the 9th Infantry , B Com[MASK]any of the 72nd Tank Battalion , and D [MASK]attery of the 82d AAA Battalion[MASK]would attack northwest ab[MASK]ve the marines and attempt to re @-@ establish conta[MASK]t with the US 23rd Infantry ; the 2nd Engineer Combat Battalion , remnants of t[MASK]e 1st Battalion , 9th Infantry , and elements of the 72nd Tank Battalion would attack on the left flank , or south , of the marines to reestablish contact with the 25th[MASK]Division . Eighth Army now ordered the U[MASK] 24th Infantry Divisio[MASK] headqu[MASK]rters and the US 19th Infantry Regiment [MASK]o move to the Susan @-@ ni area , 8 miles ( 13 km ) south of Miryang and 15 mil[MASK]s ( 24 km ) east of the confluence of the Nam River and the Naktong River . There it was to prepare to[MASK]enter the battle in either the 2nd or [MASK]5th Division zone . 
 The American counteroffensive of Sep[MASK]ember 3 – 5 west of Yongsan , according to prisoner st[MASK]tements , resulted in one of the bloodiest debacles of the war for a[MASK]Nort[MASK][MASK]Korean division . Even though remnants of the NK 9th Division , supported by the low strength NK 4th Division [MASK] still held Obong @-@ ni Ridge , Cloverleaf Hill , and t[MASK]e intervening ground back to the Naktong on September 6 , the [MASK]ivision 's offensive strength had been spent at the end of the [MASK]merican counterattack . The NK 9th and 4th d[MASK]visions were not able t[MASK] resume the offensive . [MASK] 
 = = = NK 2nd Division destroyed = = = [MASK] 
 The NK 2nd Division made a new effort ag[MASK]inst th[MASK] 23rd Infantry '[MASK] perimeter[MASK]in the predawn hours of September 8 , in an attempt to break through [MASK]astwar[MASK] . This attack , launched at[MASK]02 : 30 and heavily supported with artillery , penetrated F Company . It was apparent th[MASK]t unless F Company 's position could be restored the en[MASK]ire regimental front wo[MASK]ld collapse . When all its officers became ca[MASK]ualties , First Lieutenant[MASK]Ralph R. Robinson , adjutan[MASK] of the 2nd[MASK]Battalion , assumed command of the company . With North Koreans rapidly infiltrating his company 's position and gaining [MASK]ts rear , Robinson in the darkness made his way through them 500[MASK]yards ( 460 m ) to A Company 's position . There he obtained tha[MASK] company 's re[MASK]e[MASK]ve platoon and brought it back to F Company . He accomplished the dangerous and difficu[MASK]t task of maneuvering it into the gap in F Company 's lines in darkness and heavy rain . 
 The attack tapered off with the coming of daylight , but that night it resumed . The North Koreans struck repeatedly at the d[MASK]fen[MASK]e line . This [MASK]ime they continued the fighting into the daylight hours of 9 Sep[MASK]ember . The Air Force then concentrat[MASK]d strong air s[MASK]pport over th[MASK] regimental perim[MASK]ter to aid the groun[MASK] troops . Casualties came to the aid stations[MASK]from the i[MASK]fantry companies in an almost steady stream during the morning . All availa[MASK]le men from Headquarte[MASK]s Company and special units were formed int[MASK] squads and put into the fight at the[MASK]most critical points . At one time , the regimental reserve was down to six men . When the attack finally ceased shortly after 12 : 00 the 23rd Regiment had an estimated combat efficiency of only 38 percent . 
 This heavy night and day battle cost the NK 2nd Division most of its r[MASK]maining offensive strength . The medical officer of the NK 17th Re[MASK]iment , 2nd Division , captured a few days later , said that [MASK]he divi[MASK]ion evacuated about 300 men nightly to a hospital in Pugong @-@ ni , and th[MASK]t in the first two weeks of September the 2nd Division lost 1 @,@ 300 killed and 2 @,@ 500 wounded in the fighting[MASK]west of Changnyong .

 The North Korean[MASK]2nd and 9th Divisions were almost completely destroyed in [MASK]he battles . The 9th Division had numbered 9 @,@ 350 [MASK]en at[MASK]the beginning of the offensive on September 1 . [MASK]he 2nd Division numbered 6 @,@ 000 .

 By this time , the US 2n[MASK] Infantry Divi[MASK]ion s[MASK]ffered 1 @,@ 120 killed ,[MASK]2 @,@ 563 wounded , 67 ca[MASK]tured and 69 missing during its time at Pusan [MASK][MASK]rimeter .

 Of [MASK]ll the North Korean attacks along [MASK]he Pusan [MASK]erimeter , the Second Battle of Naktong Bulge is seen by histor[MASK]ans as the most serious[MASK]thr[MASK]at[MASK].

Howe[MASK]er , once again the fatal weakness of the North Korean Army had cost it victory after an impressive initial success — its communications a[MASK]d supply were not capable of ex[MASK]loiting a breakthrough and of supporting a continuin[MASK] attack in the face of ma[MASK]sive air , armor , and artillery fire that could be concentrated against its troops at critical points . By September 8 , the North Korean attacks in the area had been repulsed .

 = Ironclad warship = 
 
 An ironclad is a steam @-@ propelled warship prot[MASK]cted by iron or ste[MASK]l armor plates used in the early pa[MASK]t of the second half of the 19th century . The ironclad was developed as a result of the vulnerability of wooden warships to explosive or incendiary shells . The first ironclad battleship , Gloire , was launched by the French Navy in November 1859 . The British Admiralty had[MASK]been considering armored warships since[MASK]1856 and prepared a draft design for an armore[MASK] corvet[MASK]e in 1857 ; i[MASK] ear[MASK]y [MASK]859 the Royal Navy started building [MASK][MASK]o iron @-@ hulled armored frigates , and by 1861 had made the[MASK]decision to move to [MASK]n all @-@ armored battle fleet . After the first clashes of ironclads ( both with wooden[MASK]ships and with one another ) took place in 1862 during the American Civil War , it became clear that the ironclad had replac[MASK]d the unarmored ship of the line as the most powerful warship a[MASK]loat . This type of ship would come to be very[MASK]success[MASK]ul [MASK]n the American Civil War . 
 Ironclads were designed for several roles , including as high seas battleships , coastal defense ships , and long @-@ [MASK]ange cruisers . The r[MASK]pid evolution of warship design in the late 19th century [MASK]ransformed the ironclad from a wooden @-@ h[MASK]lled vessel that carried sails to supplem[MASK]nt its steam[MASK]engines into the steel @-@[MASK]built , turreted b[MASK]ttleships and cruisers familiar in the 20th century . This change was pushed forward by the development o[MASK] heavier naval guns ( the ir[MASK]nclads of the 1880s carried some of the heaviest guns [MASK]ver mounte[MASK] a[MASK] sea ) , more sophisticated steam engines , and advances in metallurgy which made steel shipbuilding possible . 
 The quick pace of change meant that [MASK]any ships were obsolete as soon as they were finish[MASK]d , and that naval tactics wer[MASK] in a stat[MASK] [MASK]f[MASK]flux . Many ironclads were built t[MASK] make use of the ram or the torpedo , which a number of naval designers co[MASK]sidered the important weapons of naval combat . The[MASK]e is no clear end to the ironclad per[MASK]od , but towards the end of the 1890s the term ironclad dropped out of use .[MASK]New ships were increasingly constructed to[MASK]a standard pattern and designated battleships or armored cruisers . 
 
 = = The ironclad = = 
 
[MASK]The ironclad became technically feasible and tactically necessary because of developments in shipbuilding [MASK][MASK] the first half of the 19th[MASK]century . According to naval historian J. Richard Hill : " The ( ironclad ) had three chief charact[MASK]ristics : a metal @-@ skinned hull , steam propu[MASK]sio[MASK] and a main armament of guns capable of firing explosive sh[MASK]lls [MASK] It is only when all three characteristics are present that a fig[MASK]ting ship can p[MASK]operly be[MASK]called an[MASK]ironclad . " Each of[MASK]these developments was introduced separately in the decade before t[MASK]e fir[MASK]t ironclads . 
 [MASK] = = = Steam propulsion = = = 
 
 In the 18th and early 19th centuries fleets had relied on two types of m[MASK]jor warship , t[MASK]e ship of the line and the[MASK]frigate . The first major ch[MASK]nge to these ty[MASK]es was the [MASK]ntroduction of steam[MASK]power for propulsion . While paddle steamer warships had been used from the 1830s onwards , steam pro[MASK]ulsion only became suitable for major warships after the adoption of the screw propeller[MASK]in the 1840s . 
 Steam @-@ powered screw fri[MASK]ates were built in the mi[MASK] @-@ 184[MASK]s , and at the end of the decade the Fr[MASK]nch Navy introduced steam powe[MASK] to its line of battle . The desire fo[MASK] change came from the ambit[MASK]on of Napoleon III to gain greater in[MASK]luence in Europe , which required a challenge to the British at sea . The first purpose @-@ built [MASK]t[MASK]am [MASK]attleship wa[MASK] the 90 @-@ gun Napoléon in 1850 . Napoléon was armed as a conventional ship @-@ of @-[MASK] the @-@ lin[MASK] , but her steam engi[MASK]es could give her a speed of 12 knots ( 22 km / h ) , regardless of t[MASK]e wind conditions : a potentially decisive a[MASK][MASK]anta[MASK]e in a naval engagement . 
 The introduction of the steam ship @-@ of @-@ the @-@ line led to a[MASK]building com[MASK]et[MASK]tion betwe[MASK]n France and Britain . Eight sister ships to Napoléon[MASK]were built in France over a peri[MASK]d of ten years , but the United Kingdom soon managed to take the lead in production . Altogether , France built ten new wooden steam battleships and con[MASK]erted 28 [MASK][MASK]om older ships of the line , while the United Kingdom built 18 and converted 41 . 
 
 = = = Explosive shells = = = 
 
 The er[MASK] of the wooden [MASK]team ship @-@[MASK]of @-@ the @-@ line was brief , because of new , more powerful naval guns . In t[MASK]e 182[MASK]s a[MASK]d 1830s , war[MASK]hips [MASK]egan to mount increasingly heavy guns , replacing 18-[MASK]and 24 @-@ pounder guns with 32 @-@ pounders on sailing ships @-@ of @-@ th[MASK] @-@ line and introducing 68 @-@ pounders on steamers . Then , the first shell guns firing explosive shells were introduced following their development by the French Gén[MASK]ral Henri @-@ Joseph Paixhans , and by the 1840s were part of the stan[MASK]ard armament for naval powers including the French Navy , Royal Navy , Imperial Russian Navy and United States Navy . It is often held that [MASK]he power of explosive shells to smash wooden hulls , as de[MASK]onstrated by the Russian destruction of an Ottoman squadron at the Battle of Sinop , spelle[MASK] the end of the wooden @-@ hulled war[MASK]hip . The more practical threat to wooden[MASK]ships was from c[MASK]nventional cannon firing red @-@ hot shot ,[MASK]which could lodge in the hul[MASK] of a wooden ship and cause a fire or ammunition explosion . Some navies eve[MASK] experimented with hollow shot filled with molten metal for extra incendiary power . 
 
 = = = Iron armor = = =[MASK]
 
 The use of iron instead of wood as the primary material of ships ' hulls began in the 1830s ; the first " warship " with an iron hull was the gunboat Nemesis , built by Laird for the East India Company in 1839 . There followed , also[MASK]from Laird , the first full @-@ blown warships with metal hulls , the 1842 steam frigates Guadelupe and Montezuma for the Mexican navy . But a thin iron skin , while not being susceptible to fire or lethal splintering like wood , was not the same thing as providing iron armor calculat[MASK]d to stop enemy gunfire . 
 Following the demonstration of the power of explosive shells against wooden ships at the Battle of Sinop , and fearing that his own ships would be vulnerable to the Paixhans guns[MASK]of Russian fortifications in the Crimean War , Emperor Napoleon II[MASK] ord[MASK]r[MASK]d the development of light @-@ dr[MASK]ft floating batteries , equipped with heavy g[MASK]ns and protected by heavy armor . Experiments mad[MASK] durin[MASK] the fi[MASK]st half of 1854 proved highly satisfactory , and on 17 July 1854 , the French communicate[MASK] to the British Government that a solution had been found to make [MASK]un @-@ proof vessels and that plans would be communicated . After tests in September 1854 , the British Admiralty agreed to build five armoured floating ba[MASK]teries on the French plans , establishing the important Thames a[MASK]d Millwall Iron Works wit[MASK]in the docks . 
 Th[MASK] French floating batter[MASK]es were deployed in 1855 as a sup[MASK]lement t[MASK] the wooden steam battle fleet in the Crimean War . The role of the battery was to assist unarmored mortar and gunboats bombarding shore fortifications . The [MASK]rench used three of their ironclad batteri[MASK]s ( Lave [MASK] Tonna[MASK]te and Dévastation ) [MASK]n 1855 against the defenses at the Battle of Kinburn on the B[MASK]ack Sea , where they were effective against Russian shore defences . They would[MASK]later be used again during the Italian war in the Adriatic in 1859 . The British floating batteries Glatton and Meteor arrived t[MASK]o late t[MASK] participa[MASK]e to the action at Kinburn .[MASK]The British planned to use theirs in the Baltic Sea against the well @-@ fortified naval base at Kronstadt . 
[MASK]The batteries have a claim to the title of the first iro[MASK]clad warships but they were capable o[MASK] only 4 knots ( 7 km / h ) under their own p[MASK]we[MASK] : [MASK]hey operated under their own powe[MASK] at the Battle of Kinburn , but ha[MASK] to be towed for long range transit . They were also arguably marginal to the work of the navy . The brief success of the floating ironclad batteries convinced France to begi[MASK] work on armored warships for th[MASK]ir battlefleet . 
 
 = = Early ironclad ships and battles = = 
 
 By t[MASK]e end of the 1850s it was clear that France[MASK]was unable to match British b[MASK]ilding of steam warships , and to regain the strategic initiative[MASK]a dr[MASK]matic change was required . The result was the first ocean @-@ going iro[MASK]clad , the Gloire , begun in 1[MASK]57 and launched in 1859 . 
 Gloire 's wooden hull was modelled on that of a steam ship of the line , reduced to one deck[MASK], she[MASK]thed in [MASK]ron [MASK]lates 4 @.@ 5 inches[MASK]( 110 mm ) thick . She w[MASK]s propelled by [MASK] steam engine , driving a sing[MASK]e screw propeller for a [MASK]peed of 13 knots ( 24 km / h ) . She was armed with thi[MASK]ty @-@ six 6 @.@ 4 @-@ inch ( 160 mm ) rifled [MASK]un[MASK] . [MASK]rance proceeded to construct 16 ironclad warships , including two more sister ships to Gloire , and[MASK]the only two @-@ decked broadside ironclads ever built , Magenta and Solférino . 
 The Royal Navy had not been keen to sacrifi[MASK]e its advantage in ste[MASK]m ships of the line , but was d[MASK]termined that the first British ir[MASK]nclad would outmatch the French ships in every respect , particularly s[MASK]eed . A fast ship would have the advantage of being able to choose a range of engagement which could make her invu[MASK]nerable to enemy fire[MASK]. The British specification was more a large , powerful frigate than a ship @-@ of @-@ the @-@ line . The requirement for speed meant a very long vessel , which had to be built from iron . The result wa[MASK] the construction of two Warrior @-@ class[MASK]ironclads ; HMS Warrior and HMS Black Prince . The ships had a successful desig[MASK] , though there were necessarily compro[MASK]ises between ' sea @-@ keepin[MASK] ' , strategic range and armou[MASK] protection ; their [MASK]eapons were more effective than that of Gloire , and with the largest set of steam engines yet fitted to a ship they [MASK]ould steam at 14 @.@ 3 knots ( 26 @.@ 5 km / [MASK] ) . Yet the Gloire and her sisters had full iron @-@ [MASK]rmour protection along the w[MASK]terline and the battery itself . Warrior and Black Prince ( but a[MASK]so the sm[MASK]ller Defence and [MASK]esistance ) wer[MASK] obliged to concentrate their[MASK]armour i[MASK] a central ' citadel ' or ' armoured box ' ,[MASK][MASK]eaving many main deck guns and the fore and aft sect[MASK]ons of the vess[MASK]l unprotected . The us[MASK] of iron in[MASK]the construction of Warrio[MASK] also came with some dra[MASK]backs ; iron hulls required more [MASK]egular and intensive repairs than wooden hulls , and iron was more susceptible[MASK]to fouling by marine life . 
 By 1862 , navies across Europe had adopted ironclads . [MASK]rita[MASK]n and France each had sixteen either completed or under const[MASK]uction , though the British vessels were larger . Austria , Italy , Russia , and Spain w[MASK]re also building ironclads . However , the first battles using[MASK]the new ironclad ships involved neither Britain nor F[MASK]ance , and involved sh[MASK]ps [MASK]ark[MASK]dly differen[MASK] from th[MASK] broadside @-@ firin[MASK] , masted designs of Gloire and Warrior . The use of ironclads by both sides in the American Civil War , and the [MASK]lash of the It[MASK]lian and Austrian fleets at the Battle of Lissa , had an important influence on the development [MASK]f ironclad design [MASK] 
 
 = = = First battles be[MASK]ween ironclads : [MASK]he U.S. Civil War [MASK] = = 
 
[MASK]The first use of ironclads in action came in the U.S. Civil War . The U.S. Navy at the time the war broke out had no ironclads , its most powerful ships being six steam @-@ powered unarmoured frigates . Since the bulk of the Navy remained loyal to the Union , the Con[MASK]ederacy sought to gain advantage in the naval conflict by acquiring modern[MASK]armored ships . In May 1861 , the Confederate Congress voted that $ 2 million be appropriated for the purchase of ironclads from overseas , and in July and August 1861 the Confederacy started work on construction and converting woode[MASK] ships . [MASK] O[MASK] 12 October 1861 , the CSS Manassas became the first ironclad to enter combat , when she fou[MASK]ht Union warships on the Mississippi during the Battle of the Head of Passes . She had been converted from a commercial vessel in New Orleans for river and coastal fighting . In Feb[MASK]uary 1862 , t[MASK]e larger CSS Virginia join[MASK][MASK] the Confederate Navy , having been rebuilt at Norfolk . Constructed on the hull of USS Merrimack , Virginia ori[MASK]inally was a conventional warshi[MASK] made of wood , but she was converted into an iron @-@ covered casem[MASK]te ironclad gunship , when she entered the Confe[MASK]era[MASK]e navy . By th[MASK]s tim[MASK] , the Union had completed seven ironclad gunboats of [MASK]he City class , and was ab[MASK]ut to complete the USS Monit[MASK]r , an[MASK]in[MASK]ovative design proposed by the Swedi[MASK]h i[MASK]ventor John Ericsson . The Union [MASK]as also building a large armored frigate , the USS New Ironsides , and the small[MASK]r USS Galena . 
 The first ba[MASK]tle between ironclads happened on 9 March 1862 , as the armored Monitor was deployed to protect t[MASK]e Union 's[MASK]wooden fleet from the ironclad ram [MASK]irginia and other Confederate warships . In this engagem[MASK]nt , the second day of the Battle of H[MASK]mpton Roads , the two ironclads repeatedly tried to ram one anot[MASK]er while shells bounced[MASK]off their[MASK]armor . The battle attracted attention worldwide , making it clear that the wooden warship was now out of date , with t[MASK]e ironclads destroy[MASK]ng them easily . 
 The Civil War saw more ironclads built by both sides , and they played an increasing role in the naval war alongside the unar[MASK]ored warships , comme[MASK]ce raiders and blockade runners . The Union built a large fleet of fifty m[MASK]nitors modeled on their namesake . The Confederacy built ships desi[MASK]ned as smaller versions of the Virginia , many of which saw action , but their att[MASK]mpts to buy ir[MASK]nclads overseas [MASK]ere frustrated as European nations confiscated ships being built for the Confederacy — especially in Russia , the o[MASK]ly country to openly support the Union through the war . Only CSS Stonewall was completed , and she arrived in A[MASK]erican waters[MASK]just in time f[MASK]r the end of the war . 
 Through the remainder of the war , ironclads saw action in the Union 's attacks on Confederate ports . Seven Unio[MASK] monitors , including USS Montauk , as well as two other [MASK]ronclads , the ironclad frigate New Ironsides and a light @-@ draft U[MASK]S Keoku[MASK] , participated in the f[MASK]iled attack on Char[MASK][MASK]ston ; one was sunk . Two small ironclads , CSS Palmetto State and CSS Chicora participated [MASK]n the defence of the harbor . For the later attack a[MASK] Mo[MASK]ile Bay , the Union asse[MASK]bled four monitors as well as 11 wooden ships , facing the CSS Tenne[MASK]see , [MASK]he Confederacy 's most powerful iro[MASK]clad and the gunboats CSS Morgan , CSS Gaines , CSS Selma . 
 On the western front , the Union built a formidable force of river ironclads[MASK], beginning with seve[MASK]al converted ri[MASK]erboats and then contractin[MASK] engineer James Eads of St. Louis , Mi[MASK]so[MASK]ri to build the City @-@ class ir[MASK]nclads . These excellent ships were built with twin engines and a central paddle wheel , all protected [MASK]y an armored casem[MASK]nt . They had a shallow dra[MASK]t , allowing [MASK]hem to journey up sm[MASK]ller tributaries , and were very well suited for river operations . Eads also pro[MASK]uced monit[MASK]rs for use on the rivers , the first two of which d[MASK]ffered from the ocean @-@ going monitors in that they c[MASK]ntained a paddle wheel ( the USS Neosho and USS Osage ) . 
 Arguably Eads vessels were some of the better ironclads of the W[MASK]stern Flotilla , but there were a number of other vessels that served valiantly with the fleet . All were of [MASK]arying design , some more succes[MASK]ful than others , and so[MASK]e were similar to[MASK]standard riverboats but with armored side @-@ mounted paddle wheels . All were armed with various smoothbore and [MASK]ome rifled guns . If nothing else the experience of the America[MASK] Civil War and its wild variety of comp[MASK]ting ironclad designs ,[MASK]some more successf[MASK]l ( or disastrous )[MASK]than others , confirmed [MASK]he emerging trade @-@ off or compromises required in a[MASK]plying the la[MASK]es[MASK] technolo[MASK]ical adva[MASK]ces in iron armour manufacture , ship construction and gun design — to name[MASK]a few — [MASK]lso going on in Europe . There was no such thing as a ' perfect ' ironclad which could be invincible in every possible encounter ; ship duels , standi[MASK]g up to forts , Brown & Blue @-@ water operations . 
 The Un[MASK]on ironclads played an important role in the Mississ[MASK]ppi and trib[MASK]taries[MASK]by providing tre[MASK]endous fire upon Confederate forts , installations and vessels with relative impunity to enemy fire . They were not as heavily armored as [MASK]he ocean @-@ going monitors of the[MASK]Union , but they were adequate for their intended use . More[MASK]Western Flotilla Union ironclads were sunk by torpedoes ( mines ) than by enemy fire , and the most d[MASK]maging fire for the Union ironclads was from shore installations , not Con[MASK]ederate vessels . 
 
 = = = Lissa : First fleet battle = = = 
 
 The first fleet battle , and the first ocean battle , involving ironclad warships was the Battle of Lissa in 1866 . Waged between the Austrian and Italian navies , th[MASK] battle pitted combined fleets of wooden frigates and corvettes and ironclad warships on both sides in the largest naval battle between the battles of Navarino and[MASK]Tsu[MASK]hima . 
 The Italian fleet consisted of 12 ironclads and a similar number of wood[MASK]n warships , esco[MASK]ting transports whi[MASK]h carried troops intending to land on the Adriatic island of Lissa . Among the Italian ironclads were seve[MASK] broadside ironclad frigates , four small[MASK]r ir[MASK]nclads , and the newly built Affondatore — a double @-@ tur[MASK]etted ram . Opposing them , the Austrian navy had seven ironclad frigate[MASK] . 
 The Austrians believed their ships to have less effective guns than their enemy , so [MASK]ecided to engage the Italians at close [MASK]ange and ram them . The Austrian f[MASK]eet form[MASK]d into an arrowhead formation with the ironclads in the first line , charging at the Italian ironclad squadron . In[MASK]the melée which followed both sides were[MASK]frustrated by the lack of damage inflicted by guns , and by the difficulty of ramm[MASK]ng — nonetheless [MASK] the effective ramming attack being made by the Austr[MASK]an flagship against the Italian attracted great attention in following years . 
 The superior Italian fleet lost i[MASK]s two ironclads , Re d 'I[MASK]alia and Palestro , while the Austrian unarmoured screw two @-@ decker SMS Kaiser remarkably survived close actions with four Italian ironc[MASK]ads . The battle ensured the popularity of the ram as a weapon [MASK]n European ironclads for many years , and the victory[MASK]won by Austria established it as the predominant naval power in the Adriatic . 
 The battles of the American Civil War and at Lissa were very influential on the designs and tactics of the ironclad fleets that followed . In particular , it taught a generation of naval officers the misleadi[MASK]g le[MASK]s[MASK]n that ramming was the best way to s[MASK]nk enemy ironclads . 
 
 = = Armament and tactics = = 
 
 The adoption of iron armor meant that the traditional naval arma[MASK]ent of dozens of light cannon became useless , since their shot would bounce [MASK]ff an armored hull . To penetrate armor , increasingly heavy guns were mounted on ships ; nevertheless , the view that [MASK]amming [MASK]as the only w[MASK]y to sink an ironclad became widespread . The increasing siz[MASK] and weight of guns also meant a movement away fr[MASK]m the shi[MASK]s mounting many guns broadside , in the manner of a ship @-@ of @-@ the @-@ line , towards a handful of guns in turrets for all @-@ round fire . 
 
 = = =[MASK]Ram c[MASK]aze = = = 
 
 From the 1860s to the 1880s many nav[MASK]l designers believed that the development of the ironclad meant that the ram was again the most important weapon in naval warfare . With steam power freeing ships from the wind , and armor making them invulnera[MASK]le to shel[MASK]fire , t[MASK]e ram [MASK]eemed to offer the oppor[MASK]unity to strike a decisive blow . 
 The scant [MASK]amage inflict[MASK][MASK] by the guns [MASK]f Monitor and Virginia at Battle of Hampton Roads and the spectacular but lucky success of the Austrian flagship SMS [MASK]rzherzog Ferdinand Max sinking the Italian Re d 'Italia at Lissa gave strength to the ramming craze . From the [MASK]arly 1870s to early 1880s most British naval officers thought that guns were about to be replaced as the main nav[MASK]l armament by the ram . Those who noted the tiny number of ships that had actually been sunk by ramming struggled to be heard . 
 The revi[MASK]al of ramming had a significant effect on naval tactics . Since the 17t[MASK] century the predom[MASK]nant tactic of naval warfare had been the line of battle , where a fleet formed a long line to give it the best fire[MASK]from its broadside guns . [MASK]his tactic was totally unsuited to ramming , and the ram threw fleet tactics into disarray . The question of how an ironclad fleet should deploy in battle to make best use of the ram was never t[MASK]sted in battle , and if it[MASK]had been , combat might have shown that rams could[MASK]only be used against ships which were already stopped dead in the water . 
 The ram fina[MASK]ly fell out of favour in the 1880s , as the same effect could be achieved wit[MASK] a torpedo , with less vulnerabil[MASK]ty to [MASK]uick [MASK]-@ firing guns . 
 
 = = = Development of naval guns = = = 
 
 The armament of ironclads tended to become concentrated in a small number of powerful guns capable of penetrating the armor of enemy ships at range ; calibre and weight of guns increase[MASK] markedly to achieve greater penetration [MASK] Thro[MASK]ghout the ironclad era navies also grappled with the complexities o[MASK] [MASK]ifled[MASK]versus[MASK]smoothbo[MASK]e guns and breech @[MASK]@ loading versus muz[MASK]le @-@ loading . 
 HMS Warrior carried a mixture of 110 @-@ pounder 7 inch ( 180 mm ) breech @-@ loading rifles and more traditional 68 @-@[MASK]pound[MASK]r smoothbore guns . Warrior highlighted the [MASK]hallenges of picki[MASK]g the[MASK]right armament ; the breech @-@ loaders sh[MASK] car[MASK]ied , designed by Sir William Armstrong , were intended to be the next g[MASK]neration of heavy armament for the Roya[MASK] Navy , but were shortly[MASK][MASK]ithdrawn from service . 
 Breech @-@ loading guns seemed to offer important advantages . A breech @-@ loader could be reloaded[MASK]without moving the gun , a lengthy process particularly if the gun [MASK]hen needed to be re @-@ aimed . The W[MASK]rrior 's Armstrong guns al[MASK]o had the [MASK]irtue of being lighter than a[MASK] [MASK]quivalent smoothbore and , because of their riflin[MASK] , more accurate . Nonetheless , the design was rejected because[MASK]of problems which plagued breech @-@ loaders for decades . 
 The weakness [MASK]f [MASK]he breech @-@ loader was th[MASK] obvious problem of sealing the breech . All guns are powered by the explosive conversion of gunpowder into gas . This explosion propels the shot or shell out of the front of the gun , but also imposes great stresses on the gun @-@ barrel . If the breech — which expe[MASK]iences some of the greatest forces in the gun — is not entirely secure , then there is a risk that either gas will discharge throu[MASK]h the breech or that the bre[MASK]ch will break . This in turn redu[MASK]es the muzzle ve[MASK]ocity of the we[MASK]pon and can also endanger the gun crew . The Warrior 's Armstrong guns suffered from bo[MASK]h prob[MASK]ems ; the shells were unable to penetrate the 4 @.@ 5 in ( 118 mm ) armor of Gloire , while s[MASK]metimes the sc[MASK]ew[MASK]which closed the breech[MASK]flew backwards out of the gun on firing . Similar problems were experienced with the breech @-@ loading guns which became standard in the French and German[MASK]navies . 
 These problems [MASK]nfluenced[MASK]the British t[MASK] equip ships with muzzle @-@ l[MASK]ading weapons of increasing[MASK]po[MASK]er until the 18[MASK]0s . After a[MASK]b[MASK]ief introduction of 100 @-@ pounder or 9 @.@ 5 @-@ inch ( 240 mm ) smoot[MASK]bore Somerset Gun[MASK], which weighed 6 @.@ 5 tons ( 6 @.@ [MASK] t ) , the [MASK]dmiralty introduce[MASK] 7 @-@ inch ( 178 mm ) rifled guns , weighing 7 tons . These were followed by a series of increasingly mammoth weapons — gu[MASK][MASK] weighing 12 , 25 , 25 , 38 and finally 81 tons , with calibre increasing from 8 @-@ inch ( 203 mm ) to 16 @-@ inch ( 406 mm ) . 
 The de[MASK]ision to retain muzzle @-@ loaders until the 1880s has been criticised by historians . However , [MASK]t least until the late 18[MASK]0s , the Bri[MASK]ish muzzle @-@ loaders had superior performance in terms of both range and rate of fire t[MASK]an the [MASK]rench and Prussian breech @-@ loaders , which suff[MASK]red from the same problems as had the first Armstrong guns . 
 From 1875 onwards[MASK], the ba[MASK]ance between breech- and muzzle @-@ loading changed . Capta[MASK]n de Bange invented [MASK] method of reliably sealing a breech , adopted by the French in 1873 . Just as compellingly , the growing size of naval guns made muzzle @-@ l[MASK]ading much more complicated . With guns of such size there was[MASK]no prospect of hauling in the gu[MASK] for[MASK]re @-@ loading , or even re @-@ loading by hand , and complicated hydraulic systems were[MASK]required for re @-@ loading the gun outside the turret without exposing the crew to e[MASK]emy fire . In 1882 , the 81 @-@ ton , 16 @-@ inch ( 406 mm ) guns of H[MASK]S Inflexible fired only[MASK]once every 11 minutes while bombarding Alexan[MASK]ria during t[MASK]e Urabi Revolt . The 100 @-@ ton , 450 mm[MASK]( 17 @.@ 72 inch ) guns of Caio Duilio could each[MASK]fire a round every 15 minutes . 
 In the Royal Navy , the sw[MASK]t[MASK]h to breech @-@ loaders was finally made in 1879 ; as well as the significant advantages in terms of performance , opin[MASK]on was swayed b[MASK] an explosion on board HMS Thunderer cause[MASK] by a gun being double @-@ loade[MASK] , a problem which could only happen with a muzzle @-@ loading gun . 
 The ca[MASK]ibre and weig[MASK]t of guns co[MASK]ld only increase so [MASK]ar . The larger the gun , the slower it would be to load , the greater the stresses on [MASK]he ship 's hull , and the less the stability of the ship . The size of the [MASK]un peaked in the 1880s , with some of the heaviest calibres of gun[MASK]ever used at sea . HMS B[MASK]nbow carried two 16 @.@ 25 @-@ inch ( 413 mm ) breech @-@ loading g[MASK]ns , ea[MASK]h wei[MASK]hing 110 tons — no British battleship would ever carry guns as lar[MASK]e . Th[MASK] Italian 450 mm ( 17 @.@ 72 inch ) guns would be larger than any gun fitted[MASK]to a battleship until the 18 @.@[MASK]1 @-@ i[MASK]ch ( 460 mm ) armament of the [MASK]apanese Yamato class of World War II . One consideration which bec[MASK]me more acute wa[MASK] that even from the original Armstrong models , following the Crimean War , range and hitting power far exceeded simple accuracy , especially at sea where the slightest roll or pitch of th[MASK] vessel as ' floating weapons @-@ pl[MASK]tform[MASK]'[MASK]could ne[MASK]ate the advantage of rifling . American ordnance experts accordingly pref[MASK]rred smoothbore monsters whose round shot could at least ' skip ' along the surface of the water . Actual effective combat ranges , they had learned dur[MASK]ng the Civil War , were comp[MASK]rable to those in the Age of Sail — though a vessel could now be smashed to pieces in[MASK]only a[MASK]few rounds . Smoke and the general chaos of battle only ad[MASK]ed to t[MASK]e problem . As a result ,[MASK]many naval engagements in the ' Age of the Ironclad ' wer[MASK] still fought at ranges within easy eyesight of their targets , and well bel[MASK]w [MASK]he maximum reach of [MASK]heir ships ' guns [MASK][MASK]
 Another method of increasing firepower was to vary the project[MASK]le fired or t[MASK]e nature of the propellant . Early ironcl[MASK]ds used black powd[MASK]r , which expanded rapidly after combustion ; this meant cannons had rela[MASK]ively s[MASK]ort barrel[MASK] , to prevent the barrel its[MASK]lf slowing the shell . The sharpness[MASK]of the black powder explosion also mean[MASK] that guns were subjected to extreme stress . One important step was to press the powder into pellets , al[MASK]owing a slower , more controlled explosion and a longer barrel . A further step forwar[MASK] was the introduction of chemically different brown powd[MASK]r which combusted more slowly again .[MASK]It also put less stress on the insides of the barrel ,[MASK]allowing guns to last longer and to be manufactured to tighter tolerances . 
 The development of smokeless powder , based on nitro[MASK]lycerine or nitrocellulose , by the French inv[MASK]ntor Paul Viell[MASK] in 1884[MASK]was a further step allowing[MASK]small[MASK]r charges of pro[MASK]ellant with longer barrels . The g[MASK]ns of the pre @-@ Dreadnought battleships of the 1890s tended to be smaller in calibre compared to the ships of the [MASK]880s , most often 12 in ( 305 mm ) , but progressively grew in length of barrel , making use of improved propellants to gain gr[MASK]ater muzzle velocity . 
 The nature of the projectiles also changed during the ironclad period . Initially , the best armor @-@ piercing projectile was a solid cast @-@ iron shot . Later , shot of chilled iron , a [MASK]arder iron alloy , gave better armor @-@ pier[MASK]ing qualities . Eventua[MASK]ly the armor @-@ piercing shell was devel[MASK]ped . [MASK]

 = = = = Broadside ironclads = = = = 
 
 The first British , French and Russian ironclads , in a logical development of warship design from the long preceding era of wooden ships of the l[MASK]ne , carrie[MASK] their weapons in a single l[MASK]ne along their [MASK]ides and [MASK]o were called " broadside ironclads . " Both Gloire and HMS Warrior were examp[MASK]es of[MASK]this type . Beca[MASK]se their armo[MASK] was so heavy , they c[MASK]uld only carry a si[MASK]gle row of guns along the main deck on each side [MASK]ather tha[MASK] a row on each deck . 
 A s[MASK]gnificant number of broadside ironclads were built in [MASK]he [MASK]860s , principally in Britain and Fra[MASK]ce , but in smaller numbers by other powers including Italy , Au[MASK]tria , Russia and the United States . The adv[MASK]ntages of mounting guns on both bro[MASK]dsides was that the ship could engage more than one adversary at a time , and the rigging did not impede the field o[MASK] fire . 
 Broadside armament also had disadvantages , which became more serious as ironclad technology developed . Heavier guns to penetrate ever @-@ thick[MASK]r armor meant that fewer guns could be carried . Furthermore , the adoption of ramming as an important tactic meant the n[MASK]ed for ahead and all @-[MASK] round[MASK]fire . These problems led to broadside designs being su[MASK]erseded by designs that gave greater all @-@ [MASK]ound [MASK]ire , which included central @-@ battery , turret , and barbette designs . 
 
 = = = = Turrets , batteries and barbettes = = = = 
 
 There were two main design[MASK]alternatives to th[MASK] broadside . In one design [MASK] the guns were pla[MASK]ed in an armoured casemate amidships : this arrangement was called the ' box @-@ battery ' or [MASK] ce[MASK]tre @-@ battery ' . In the other , th[MASK] [MASK]uns could be placed on a rotating platform to give them a broad field[MASK]of fire ; when fully armored , this arrangement was called a turret and when partially armored or unarmored , a barbette . 
 T[MASK]e centre @-@ battery was the simpler and , during the 1860s and 1870s , the more popula[MASK] method . Concentrating guns amidships meant the ship [MASK]ould be shorter and handier than a broadsid[MASK] type . The first full @-@ scale centre @-@ batte[MASK]y ship was HMS Beller[MASK]phon o[MASK] 1865 ; the F[MASK]ench laid down centre @-@ battery ironclads in 186[MASK] whic[MASK] were not completed until 1870 . Centre @-@ battery ships often , but not always , had a recessed freeboard enabling some of their guns to fire directly ahead . 
 The turret was first u[MASK]ed in naval combat on the USS Monitor in 1862 , with a type of turret designed by the Swedish engineer John Ericsson . A competing turret design was proposed by the British inven[MASK]o[MASK] Cowper C[MASK]les with a prototype of th[MASK]s installed on HMS Trusty in 1861 for testing and evaluation purposes . Ericsson 's turret turned on a central spindle , and Coles 's turned on a ring of bearings . Turrets offered the[MASK]maximum arc of fire from the guns , but there were significant problems with their use in the 1860s . The fire arc of a turret would be considerably limited by ma[MASK]ts and rigging , so they were unsuited to use on the earlier ocean @-@ going ironclads . The second p[MASK]oblem was that turrets were extremel[MASK][MASK]heavy . Ericsson was a[MASK]le to offer the heaviest possible turret ( guns and armour protection ) by delibera[MASK]ely designing a ship with very low freeboard . The weight thus saved from [MASK]aving a high broadside above the waterline [MASK]as diverted to actual guns a[MASK]d armour . Low freeboard , however , also meant a smaller hull and therefore a smaller capacity for coal storage — and therefore range of the vessel . In man[MASK] respects , the turreted , low @-@ [MASK]reeboard Monitor and the[MASK]broadside sailer HMS Warrior represented two opposite extremes in [MASK]hat an ' Ironclad ' was all [MASK]bout . The most dramatic attempt to co[MASK]promise the[MASK]e two extremes , or ' squaring this circle ' , was designed by Captain Cowper Phipps Coles : HMS Captain , a dangerou[MASK]ly low freeboard turret ship [MASK]hich nevertheless car[MASK]ied a full rig of sail , and which subsequently capsized not long after her la[MASK]nch in 1870 . Her half @-@ sister HMS Monarch was[MASK]restricted to firing from her turrets only on the p[MASK]rt and starb[MASK]ard bea[MASK]s [MASK] The third Royal Navy ship to combine turrets and masts was HMS Inflexible of[MASK]1876 , which carried two turrets on either side of the centr[MASK] @-@ line , allowing both t[MASK] fire fore , aft and broadside . 
 A lighter alternative to the turret , particul[MASK]rly popular with the Fren[MASK]h navy , was the barbette . These were fixed armored towers which held a gun on a turntable . The crew was sheltered fr[MASK]m dire[MASK]t fire , but vulnerable to plunging fire , for instance from shore emplacements . The[MASK]barbette was lighter than[MASK]the turret , needing less machinery and no roof armor — though nevertheless some barbettes were stri[MASK]ped of their armor [MASK]late to reduce the top @-@ weight of their ships . The barbette became [MASK]idely adopted in the 1880s , and[MASK]with[MASK]the addition of an armored ' gun @-@ house ' , transformed into the t[MASK]rrets of the pre @-@ Dreadnough[MASK] battleships . 
 
 = = = Torpedoes = = = 
 
 The ironclad age[MASK]saw the developmen[MASK] of explos[MASK]ve torpedoes as naval weapons , which helped compli[MASK]ate the [MASK]esig[MASK] and tactics of ironclad fleets . Th[MASK] first torpedoes were static mines , used extensively in the American Civil War . That conflict also saw the development of the spar torpedo , an explosive charge pushed again[MASK]t the hull of a warship by a small boat . For the first time[MASK], a large warship faced a serious threat from a smaller o[MASK]e — and given the relative ine[MASK]ficiency of shellfire against ironclads , the threat from the spar torpedo was taken seriously . The U.S. Navy converted four of its monitors to become turretless armored spar @-@ torpedo vessels while under construction in 1864 – 5 , but these vessels never saw action . Another proposal [MASK] the towed or ' Harvey ' torp[MASK]do , involved an explosive[MASK]on a line or outrigger ; either to deter a ship [MASK]rom ramming or to make a torpedo attack by a boat less suicidal[MASK]. 
 A more practical and influential weapon was th[MASK] self @-@ propelled or Whitehead torpedo . Invented in 1868 and deployed in the 1870s , the Whitehead[MASK]tor[MASK]e[MASK]o f[MASK]r[MASK]ed part of the armamen[MASK] of[MASK]ironclads of the 18[MASK]0s [MASK]ike HMS Inflexible [MASK]nd the Italian Caio Duilio and Enrico Dandolo . The ironclad 's [MASK]ulnerability to the torpedo was a key pa[MASK]t of the cri[MASK]ique of armored warships made by[MASK]the Jeun[MASK] Ecole school of naval thoug[MASK]t ; it appeared that any ship armored enough to prevent destruction by gunfi[MASK]e would b[MASK] slow enough to be easily caught by to[MASK]pedo . In[MASK]practice , however , the Jeune Ecole was only briefly inf[MASK]uential and the torpedo formed part of the confus[MASK]ng mixture of wea[MASK]ons possessed by ironclads .

 The first ironclads w[MASK]re built on wooden or iron hulls , and prote[MASK]ted by wrought iron armor backed by thick wooden planking [MASK] Iron[MASK]lads were still being built w[MASK]th wooden hulls into the 1870s .

 Using iron construction for warships offered advantages for the engineering of th[MASK] hull . However , unarmored iron[MASK]ha[MASK] many mili[MASK]ary disadvantages , and [MASK]ffered technical p[MASK]oblems which kept wooden hulls[MASK]in use for many years , particularly for [MASK][MASK]ng @-@ range cruising warships . 
 Iron ships [MASK]ad first been proposed for military use[MASK]in the 1820s . In the 1830s and 1840s , France , Britain and the United States had all experimented with iro[MASK] @-@ hulled but unarmored gunboats and frigates . However , the iro[MASK] @-@ hulle[MASK] frigate was abandoned by the end [MASK]f the 1840s , becaus[MASK] iron hulls wer[MASK] more vulnerable to solid shot ; iron wa[MASK] more brittle [MASK]han wood , and iron frames more likely to fall out of shape than wood . 
 The unsuitability of unarmored iron for warship hul[MASK]s meant that iron was only adopted as a building material f[MASK]r battleships when protected by armor . However , iron gave the naval architect many advantages . Iron allowed lar[MASK]er s[MASK]ips and[MASK]more flexible design , for instance the use of [MASK]at[MASK]rtight bulkheads on the lower decks . Warrior , bu[MASK]lt of iron , was longer and faster than the wooden @-@ hulled Gloire . Iron could be produced to order and used immediately , in contrast [MASK]o the need to give wood a long period of seasoning . And , given the large quantities of wood required to build a steam warship and the falling cost of iron , iron hulls were increasingly cost @-@ effective . The main reason f[MASK]r the French use of wooden hulls for the ironclad fleet built in the 1860s was that the French iron indu[MASK]try could not supply enough , and the main reason why Britain built its handful of wooden @-@ hulled[MASK]ironclads was to make best use of hulls already started and wood already bought . [MASK] Wooden hulls continued to b[MASK] used for long @-@ range and smaller ironclads , because iron neverthel[MASK]ss had a significant disadvantage . Iron hulls suffered quick fouling by marine life , slowing the ships down — manageable for a European battlefleet close to dry docks , but a difficulty for long @-@ range sh[MASK]ps . The only solution was to sheath the iron hull first in wood and then in[MASK]cop[MASK]er , a lab[MASK]rious and ex[MASK]ensive process which made wooden c[MASK]nstruction remain attractive . Iron [MASK]nd wood were to some extent in[MASK]erchang[MASK]able : the Japanese Kongō and Hiei ordered in 1875 were sister @-@ ships , but one was built of iron and the other of composite constr[MASK]ction . 
 Afte[MASK] 187[MASK] , steel st[MASK]rted to be intro[MASK]uced as a material for construction . Compared to iron , steel allows for greater structural strength for a lower weight . The French Navy le[MASK] the way with the use of steel in i[MASK]s fleet , starting with the Redoutable , laid down in[MASK]1873 and launched in 1876 . Re[MASK]outable nonetheless had wrou[MASK]h[MASK] iron armor plate , and part of her exterior hull was i[MASK]on rather than steel [MASK] 
 Even though Britain led the world in steel production , the Royal Navy was slow to adopt steel warships . The Besseme[MASK] process for steel manufacture produced too many imperfections for large @-@ scale use o[MASK] ships . French manufacturers used the Siemens @-@ Martin process to produce adequate steel , but British technology la[MASK]ged behind . The first all [MASK]-@ steel warships built by the Royal Navy were the[MASK]dispatch vessels Iris and Mercury , laid down in [MASK]875 and 1876 . 
 
 = = = Armor and protection schemes = = = 
 
 Iron @-@ bu[MASK]lt ships used wood as part of[MASK]their protection scheme . HMS Warrior was protected by 4 @.@ 5 in ( 114 mm ) of wrought iron backed by 15 in ( 381 mm ) of teak , the strongest shipbuilding woo[MASK] . The wood played two roles[MASK], preventing spalli[MASK]g and[MASK]also pre[MASK]enting the shock of a hit damaging the structure [MASK]f the ship . Later , wood and iron were combined in ' sandwich ' armor , for instance in HMS Inflexible . 
 Steel wa[MASK] also an obvious materia[MASK] for armor . It was tested in [MASK]he 1860s , but the steel of the time was too brittle and disintegrated when struck by shells . Steel became practical to use when a[MASK]way was found to fuse steel onto wrou[MASK]ht iron plates , givin[MASK] a form of compound armor . This comp[MASK]und [MASK]rmor was used by the British in ships built from the late 1870s , first for turret armor ([MASK]starting with HMS Inflexible ) and then for all armor ( starting with HMS Colossus of 1882 ) . T[MASK]e[MASK]French and German navies [MASK]dopted the innovat[MASK]on almost immediately , with licenses being given for the use of the ' Wilson Sy[MASK]tem ' of producing fused armor . 
 The[MASK]first iron[MASK]lads to have all @-@ [MASK]teel armor were the Italian Caio Duilio and Enrico Dandolo . Th[MASK]ugh the ships were laid down in 1873 the[MASK]r armor was not purchased from France until 1877 . The French navy decided in 1880 to adopt compound armor for its fleet , but found it limited in supply , so from 1884 the French navy was using steel armor . Britain stuck to co[MASK]pound armor until 1889 . 
 The ultimate ironclad armo[MASK] was c[MASK]se hardened nickel @-@ steel . In 1890 , the U.S. Navy tested steel armor [MASK]ardened by the Harvey process and found it superior t[MASK] compound armor [MASK] For several years ' Harve[MASK] steel ' was the state of the art , produced i[MASK] the U.S. , France , Germany , Britain , Austria and Italy . In 1894 , the Germ[MASK]n firm Krupp developed gas cementing , which further hardened steel armor . The [MASK]erman Kaiser Friedric[MASK] III , laid down in 1895 , was the first [MASK]hip to benefit from the new ' Krupp armor ' and the new armor was quickly adopted ; the Royal Navy using it from HMS Canopus , laid down in 1896 . By 1901 almost all new battleships used Krupp armor , tho[MASK]gh the U.S. continued to use Harvey armor alongside until the end of[MASK]the decade . 
 The equivalent strengths of the different armor plates was as follows : 15 in ( 381 m[MASK] ) of wrought iron was equivalent to 12 in ( 305 mm ) of either plai[MASK] steel or compound iron and [MASK]teel ar[MASK]or , and to 7 @.@ [MASK]5 in ( 197 mm ) of Harve[MASK] armor or 5 @.@ 75 in ( 146 mm ) of Krupp armor . 
 Iron[MASK]lad co[MASK]struction also prefigured the later debate in battleship design b[MASK]tween t[MASK]pering and ' all @-@ or @-@ nothing ' armour design . Warrior was only semi @-@ armoured , and could have been disabled by hits on t[MASK]e bow and stern . As the thickness of armor grew to protect ships from the inc[MASK]easingly heav[MASK] guns , the [MASK]rea of the ship which could be fully protected diminished . Inflexible 's[MASK]armor protection was largely limited to the central citadel amidships , protecting boilers and engines , turrets and mag[MASK]zines , and l[MASK]ttle else . An ingenious arrangement of cork @-@ filled compartm[MASK]nts a[MASK]d watertight bulkheads was intended to keep her stable and afloat in the event of h[MASK]avy damage to her un @-@ armored sections . 
 
 = = Propulsion : steam and sail = = 
 
 The first ocean [MASK]-@ [MASK]oing ironclads carried masts and sai[MASK]s like their wooden [MASK]redecessors , and these fe[MASK]tures were only gradually aband[MASK]ned . Early steam engines were inefficient ; the wooden steam fleet of the Royal Navy could only carry " 5 to 9 da[MASK]s coal " , [MASK]nd the situation was similar with the early[MASK]ironclads . Warrior also illust[MASK]ates two design features which aided hybrid propulsion ; she had retractable screws to reduce drag while under sail ( though in practice the steam engine was run at a low throttle ) , and a telescop[MASK]c funnel which could be fol[MASK]ed down to the deck level . 
 Ship[MASK] designed for coastal warfare , like the floating batteries of the Crimea , or USS Monitor and her [MASK]isters , dispensed with masts from the beginning . The British HMS Devastation , started in 1869 , was the first large , ocean @-@ going ironclad[MASK]to dispense with masts . Her principal role was for combat in the English Channel and other European waters ; and while her coal supplies gave [MASK]er enough range to cross the Atl[MASK]ntic , she would have had little endurance on the other side o[MASK] the ocean . The Devastation and the similar ships commissioned by th[MASK] British and Rus[MASK]ian navies in th[MASK] 187[MASK]s were the exception r[MASK]ther than[MASK]the rule . Most ironclads of the 1[MASK]70s [MASK]etained masts , and only the Italian navy , which during that decade was [MASK]ocused on short @-@ range operations in the Adriatic , built consis[MASK]ently mastless ironclads . 
 During the 1860s , steam engines improved with the adoption of double @-@ expansion stea[MASK] engines , which used 30 – 40 % less coal than earlier model[MASK] . The Royal Navy decided to switch to the double @-@ exp[MASK]nsion engine [MASK]n 1871 , [MASK]nd[MASK]by 1875 they were widespread . However , this development alone was not enough to herald the end[MASK][MASK]f the m[MASK]st . Whether th[MASK]s was due to[MASK]a [MASK]onservative desire to retain sails , or was a rational response to the op[MASK]ra[MASK]ional [MASK]nd strategic situation , is a matter of debate . A steam @-@ only fleet would require a network of coaling stations wo[MASK]ldwide , which would need to be fortified at great expense to stop th[MASK]m falling into en[MASK]my hands . Just as significantly , because of unsolved problems with the te[MASK]hnology of the boilers whi[MASK]h provided steam for the engines , the performance of double [MASK]-@ expansion engines was rarely as good in practice as it was in theory . 
 During the[MASK]1870s the distinction grew between ' f[MASK]rst @-@ class ironclads ' or '[MASK]battleships '[MASK]on the one hand , and ' cruising ironclads ' designed for long @-@ range work on the other . The demands on first @-@ class ironclads for very heavy[MASK]armor[MASK]and armament meant[MASK]increasing displacement , which reduced speed under sail ; and [MASK]he fashion for turrets and barbettes made a sailing rig increasingly [MASK]nco[MASK]venient . HMS Inflexible , launched in 1876 but not commissioned until 1881 , was the [MASK]ast British battleship t[MASK] carry masts , and these were [MASK]idely seen as a mistake . The start of the 1880s saw the end of sailing rig on i[MASK]onclad battleships . 
 Sails persisted on ' cruising ironclads ' for much longer . During the 1860s , the French navy had produced the Alma[MASK]and La Galissonnière classes as small , lo[MASK]g @-@ range ironclads as overseas cruisers and the British had responded with [MASK]hips like HMS Swiftsure of 1870 . The Russian ship General @-@ Admiral , [MASK]aid down in 1870 and completed in 1875 , was a model of a fast , long @-@ range ir[MASK]nclad[MASK]which was[MASK]like[MASK]y to be able to outrun and outfight ships like Swiftsure . Even the later HMS Shannon , often described as the first British armored cruiser , would have been too slow to outrun Gener[MASK]l [MASK]-@ Admiral . While Shannon was the last British sh[MASK]p with a retractable propellor , later armored cruisers of the 1870s retained sailing rig , sacrificing speed under steam in consequence . It took until 1881 for the[MASK]Royal [MASK]avy to lay down a long @-@ range armored warship capable of catching enemy commerce raiders , HMS Warspite , which[MASK]was co[MASK]pleted in 1888 . While sailing rigs were obsolescent for all purposes[MASK]by the end of the 1880s , rigged ships were in service until the early years of the 20th ce[MASK]tury . 
 The final evolution of ironclad propulsion was the adoption of the triple @-@ expansion steam engine , a further refinement which was first adopted in HMS Sans Pareil , laid down in 18[MASK]5 and commissioned in 1891 . Many ships [MASK]lso used a forced draught to get additional power from their engines , and this system was widely used until the introduction of the steam turbine in the mid @-@ 1900s ( decade ) .

 While ironclads spread rapidly in navies worldwide , there were few pitched naval battles involvi[MASK]g ironclads . Most European nations settled differences on [MASK]and , [MASK]nd the Royal N[MASK]vy struggled[MASK]to maintain a deterrent parity with at least France , while providing sui[MASK]able protection to Britain 's commerce and colonial outposts worldwide [MASK] Ironcla[MASK]s rem[MASK]ined , for the Brit[MASK]sh Royal Navy , a mat[MASK]er of defending the Br[MASK]tish Isles first and projecting power abroad second . Thos[MASK] naval engagements of the lat[MASK]er hal[MASK] of the 19th @-@ century which involved ironclads normally involved colonial actions or clashes between second[MASK]@-@ rate naval powers . [MASK]ut these encounters were often enough to convince British policy @-@ makers of[MASK]the increasing hazards of strictly n[MASK]val foreign intervention[MASK], [MASK]rom Hampton Roads in the Ame[MASK]ican Civil War t[MASK] the hardening combined defenc[MASK]s of nav[MASK]l arsenals such as Kronstadt and C[MASK]erbourg[MASK]. 
 There were many types of ironclads : 
 Seagoing ships intended to " stand in the line of battle " ; the precursors of the battleship . 
 Coastal service and riverine vessels , including ' floating ba[MASK]teries ' and ' monitors' 
 Vessels intended for commer[MASK]e raiding or protection of commerce [MASK] called ' armou[MASK]ed cruisers'[MASK]

 The United Kingdom possessed the largest navy in the world [MASK]or the whole of the ironclad period . The Royal Navy was the second to [MASK]dopt ironclad warships , [MASK]nd it applied them worldwide in their whole range of roles . In the age of[MASK]sail , the British strategy for war depended on the Ro[MASK]al Navy mo[MASK]nting a blockade of the ports of the enemy . Because of the limited endurance of steams[MASK]ips , this was no longer possible , so[MASK]the British at times considered the risk @-@ laden plan of engaging an enemy fleet in harbor as soon as war broke out . To this end , th[MASK] Royal Navy developed a series of ' coast @-@ defence battleships ' , [MASK]tarting with the Devastation class . These ' br[MASK]astwork monitors ' were markedly different from the other [MASK]igh @-@ seas ironclads of the period and [MASK]ere an important precursor of the modern battleship . As long @-@ range monitors they could reach Bermuda unescorted , for example . Ho[MASK]ever , they were still armed with only four heavy guns and were as vulnerable to mines and obstructions [MASK] and enemy monitors ) as the original monitors of the Union Navy proved to be during the Civil War . The British prepared for an overwhelming mortar bombardment of Kronstadt by the close of the Crimean [MASK]ar , b[MASK]t never considered running the smoke [MASK]-@ ridden , shallow @-@ water gauntlet straight to St. Petersburg with ironclads . Likewise , monit[MASK]rs proved acutely unable to ' overwhelm ' enemy fortifications single @-@ handed during the American conflict , though their [MASK]ow @-@ profile and heavy armour p[MASK]otecti[MASK]n made them ideal for running[MASK]gauntlets . Mines and obstructions , however , negated these advantages [MASK] a problem the British [MASK]dmiralty frequently acknow[MASK]edged but neve[MASK] counte[MASK]ed througho[MASK]t[MASK]the period . The British never laid down enough Devastation @-@ class[MASK]' battleships ' to instantly overwhelm Cherbourg , Kronstadt or even New York City with gunfire . Although[MASK]throughout the 1860s and 1870s th[MASK] Royal Navy was still [MASK]n many respects superior to its potential rivals , by the early 1880s widespread co[MASK]cern about the threat from France and Germany culminated in t[MASK]e Naval Defence Act , [MASK]hich promulgated the ide[MASK] of a ' two @-@ power standard ' , that Brita[MASK]n should possess as many ships as the next two navies combined . This standard provoked aggre[MASK]sive shipbuilding in the 1880s and 1890s . 
 British ships did not participate in any major wars in the ironclad period . The Royal Navy 's ironclads only saw actio[MASK] as pa[MASK]t of colonial battl[MASK]s or one @-@ sided engagements [MASK]ike the bombardment of Alexandria in 1882 . Defending British interests a[MASK]ainst[MASK]Ahmed ' Urabi 's Egypt[MASK]an revolt , a British fleet opened fire on the fortifications around the port of Alexandria . A mixture of centre @-@ battery and turret ships bombard[MASK]d Egyptian positions for most of a day , forcing th[MASK] Egyptians to retreat ; return fire [MASK]rom Egyptia[MASK] guns was hea[MASK]y at first , but inflicted little damage , killing only five Britis[MASK] sailors . Few Egyptian g[MASK]ns were actually dismounted , on the other hand , and the fortifications themselves were typically left intact . Had the Egyptians actually utilised the heavy mortars that were at their disposal , they m[MASK]ght have quickly turned the tide , for the attacking British[MASK]ironclads found it easy ( fo[MASK] accuracy 's sake ) to simply anchor [MASK]hilst firing — p[MASK]rfect ta[MASK]gets for high @-@ angle fire upon their thinly armoured topdecks . 
 The French navy b[MASK]ilt the first ironclad to try to gain a str[MASK]tegic advantage over the Britis[MASK] , but were consistently out @-[MASK] built by the British . Despite taking the lead with a number of innovations like breech @-@ loading weapons and steel construction , the French navy could never [MASK]atch t[MASK]e size of the[MASK]Royal Navy . In the 1870s , the construction of ironclads ceased for a while in France as the Jeune Ecole school of naval thought took prominence , suggestin[MASK] th[MASK]t torpedo boats and unarmor[MASK]d cruisers would be the future of warships . Like the British , the French navy saw little action with its ironclads ; the F[MASK]ench blockade of Germany in the Franco @-@ Prussian War was ineffective , as the war was settled entirely on land . 
 Russ[MASK]a built a number of ironclads , generally copies of British or French designs . Noneth[MASK]less , [MASK]here were real innovations from Russia ; the first true[MASK]type of ironclad armor[MASK]d cruiser , the General @-@ Admiral of the 1870s , and a set of remarkably badly designed circular battleships re[MASK]erred to as ' popovkas ' ( for Admiral Popov [MASK] who conceived the design ) . The Russian Navy pioneered the wide @-@ scale use of torpedo boats during the Russo @-@ Turkish War of 1877 – 1878 , m[MASK]inly out of necessity because of the superior [MASK]umbers and quality of ir[MASK]nclads[MASK]used by the Turkish navy . Russia expanded her navy in the 1880s and 1890s with modern armored cruiser[MASK] and battleshi[MASK]s , but the ships were manned[MASK]by inexperienced crews and politica[MASK]ly appointed lead[MASK]rship , which en[MASK]anced their d[MASK]feat in the Battle of [MASK]sushima on 27 May 1905 .[MASK]
 The U.[MASK]. Navy[MASK]ended the Civi[MASK] War with about fifty monitor @-@ type coastal ironclads ; by the 1870s most of the[MASK]e were laid up in reserve , leaving the USA v[MASK]rtually without an ironclad fleet . Another five large monitors were ordered in the 1870s . The limitation[MASK] of the monitor type effectively prevented the USA from projecting power overseas , and until the 1890s the USA would have come off badly in a conflict with even Spain or the Latin[MASK]American powers . The 1890s saw the beginning of what became the Great White Fleet , and [MASK][MASK] was the mod[MASK]rn pre @-@ Dreadnoughts and armored cruisers built in the 1890s which d[MASK]feated the Spanish fleet in the Spanish – American War of 1898 . This started a new era of nav[MASK]l warfare . 
 Ironclads were widely [MASK]sed in South America . Both sides used ironclads in the Chincha Islands War between Spain and the combined for[MASK]es of Peru and Chile in [MASK]he early 1860s . The powerful Spanish Numancia participated in the Battle of Callao but was unable to inflict[MASK]significan[MASK] damage to the Callao defences . Besides , Peru was able to deploy two locally built ironclads based on American Civil War d[MASK]signs , the Loa ( a wooden ship converted into a case[MASK]ate iro[MASK]clad ) and the Victoria ( a s[MASK]all monitor armed with a single 68 @-@ pdr gun ) , as well as two British @-@ [MASK]uilt ironcl[MASK]ds : Independencia , a centre @-@ battery ship , and the turret [MASK]hip Huáscar . Numa[MASK]cia was the first ironclad to circ[MASK]mnavigate the world , arriving in Cádiz[MASK]on 20 September 1867 , and ea[MASK]ning the motto : " Enloricata navis que primo terram ci[MASK]cuivit " [ " First [MASK]ronclad ship to sail around the world " ] ) . In the War of the Pacific in 1879 , both Peru and[MASK]Chile had ironclad warships , including some of those use[MASK] a few years previously against Spain .[MASK]While the Ind[MASK]pendencia ran aground early on , the Peruvian ironclad ' Huáscar made a great impact against Chilean[MASK]shipping , delaying Chilean ground invasion by six months . She was event[MASK]ally caught by two more modern Chilean centre @-@ battery ironclads , the Blanc[MASK] Encalada and the Almirante Cochrane at the Battle of Anga[MASK]os Point . 
 Ironclads were a[MASK]so used from the [MASK]nception of the[MASK]Imperial Japanese Navy . The Kōtetsu ( Japanese : 甲鉄 , literally " Ironclad " , later renamed Azuma 東 , " East " ) had a decisive role in the Naval Battle of Hakodate Bay in May 186[MASK] , which marked the end of the Boshin War , and the complet[MASK] establishment of the Meiji Restoration . The IJN continu[MASK]d to develop its strength and commissioned a n[MASK]mber of warships from British and European shipyards , first ironclads an[MASK] later armored cruisers . These[MASK]ships engaged the Chinese Beiyang fleet which was superior on paper at least at the Battle of the Yalu River . Thank[MASK] to superior short @-@ range firepower , the Japanese fleet came off better , s[MASK]nking or severely damaging eight ships and receiving serious damage to only four . The naval war was conc[MASK]uded the next year at the Battle of Weihaiwei , where the strongest remaining Chinese ships were [MASK]u[MASK]rendered to the Japanese . 
 
 = = End of [MASK]he ironclad warship = = 
 
 There is no clearl[MASK] defined[MASK]end to the ironclad , besides the transition from wood hulls to all @-@ metal . Ironclads continued to be used in World War I. Towards the end of t[MASK]e 19th century , the descriptions ' battleship ' and ' armored cr[MASK]iser ' came to replace the term ' ironclad ' . 
 The proliferation of ironc[MASK]ad battleship designs came to an end in the 1890[MASK] as navies reached a consensus on the design of battleships , producing the [MASK]ype known as the pre @-@ Dreadnought . These ships are sometimes covered in treatments of the iro[MASK]clad warship . The next evolution of battleship design , the dreadnought , is n[MASK]ver r[MASK]ferred to as an ' ironclad ' . 
 Most of the ironclads of the 1870s and 1880s served into[MASK][MASK]he 1900s ( decade ) . For instance , a handful o[MASK] US navy monitors laid down in [MASK]h[MASK] 1870s [MASK]aw active service in World War I. Pre @-@ Dreadnought battleships and cruisers o[MASK] th[MASK] 1890s saw widespread[MASK]action in World War I and in some cases through to World War [MASK]I .

 The example of the ironclads had some bearing on th[MASK] history of the tank , as ironclad warships became an[MASK]inspiration for ideas of landships and other armor[MASK]d vehicles . H. G.

 = Little Gidding ( poem ) = 
 
 Little Giddi[MASK]g is the fourth and final poem of T. S. Eliot 's Four Quartets , a series of poems that[MASK]di[MASK]cuss time , perspect[MASK]ve , humanity , and salvation . It was first published in September 1942 after being delayed for over a year because of the air @-@ raids on Great Britain during Wor[MASK]d War[MASK]II a[MASK]d Eliot 's declining health . The title refers to a small Anglican community in Huntingdonshire , established by Nicholas Ferrar in the 17th century and scattered during the English Civil War . 
 The po[MASK]m uses the combined image of fire and Pentecos[MASK]al fire to[MASK]emphasise the[MASK]need for purification and purgation . According to the poet , humanity 's flawed unders[MASK]anding of life and turning away from God leads to a cycle of warfare , but this[MASK]can be ov[MASK]rcome by recognising the [MASK]essons of the past . With[MASK]n the poem , the narrator meets a ghost that is a combination of various poets and literary figures . Litt[MASK]e Gidding focuses on the unity of past , present , and future , and claims that understanding this unity is necessary for salvation . 
 
 = = Background = = 
 
 F[MASK]llowing the completion of the third Four Quartets poem , The Dry Salvages , Eliot '[MASK] health declined and he stayed in Shamley Green , Surrey while he recovered . During this time , Eliot started writing Li[MASK]tle Gidding . The first draft was completed in July 1941 but he was dissatisf[MASK]ed with it . He believed the problems with the poem lay with his own inability to write , and that , precipitated by air raids on London , he had started the poem with too little preparation and had written it too quickly . After the first dr[MASK]ft was written , he set the poem aside , and he left in September to lecture throughout Great Britain . 
 Aft[MASK]r months of not working on the poem , Eliot began to feel compelled to finish it ; it was n[MASK]t until August 1942 , h[MASK]wever , [MASK]hat he started working on i[MASK] again . In total , there were five drafts . The poem was finished by 19 September 1942 and published in the October New English Weekly . Little Gidding was intended to conclude the Four Quartets series , summarising Eliot 's views expressed in this series of poems . 
 Little Gidding wa[MASK] the home of an Anglican community established in 16[MASK]6 by Nicholas Ferrar . The F[MASK]rrar household lived a Chris[MASK]ian life according to High Church principles and the Book of Common Prayer . The religious community was dispersed during the English Civil W[MASK]r between Parliamentarians and Royalists but reformed , ending wi[MASK]h the death of John Ferrar in 1657 . [MASK]liot had visited the site in May 1936 . 
 Unlike [MASK]he other locations mentioned in the titles of the F[MASK]ur Quartets poems , Eliot had n[MASK] direct connecti[MASK]n to the original Christ[MASK]an community . As such , the community [MASK]s supposed to represent almo[MASK]t any religious community .

 Critics classify Little Gidding as a poem of fire with an emphasis on purgation and the Pentecostal fire . The beginni[MASK]g of the poem discusses time an[MASK] winter , with attention paid to the arrival of summer . The images of sno[MASK] ,[MASK]which provoke desires for a spiritual life , transiti[MASK]n into an analysis of the four classical [MASK]lements of fire , earth , air and water and how fire is the primary element of the four . Following this is a discussion on death and destruction , things unaccomplished , and regret for past eve[MASK]ts . [MASK] While using Dante 's terza rima style , the poem continues by describing t[MASK]e Battle of Britain . The image of warfare merges with the depiction of Pentecost , and the Holy Spirit is juxta[MASK]osed with the air @[MASK]@ raids[MASK]on London . In the second section , a ghost , representing the poets of the past [MASK]tuck between worlds , begins talking to the narrator of the poem . The ghost discusses change , art[MASK]in general , and how humankind is flawed . The only way to overcome [MASK]he problematic condition of humanity , according to the ghost , [MASK]s to experience purgation through fire [MASK][MASK]The fire is described in a manner similar to Julian of Norwich 's writing about God 's love and discussed in relationship to the shirt of Nessus , a shirt that burns its wearer . Little Gidding continues by describing the eternalne[MASK]s of the present and how history exists in a patte[MASK]n . The poem concludes by explaining how sacrifice is needed[MASK]to allow an individua[MASK] to die into life and be reb[MASK]rn , and that salvation should be the goal of humankind .

 In terms of renewal , Eliot believed that suffering [MASK]as needed for all of [MASK]ociety befor[MASK] new life could begin . The original Little Gidding community was built for living on monastic lines , but the community was damaged and dispersed by Puritan forces during the English Civil War[MASK]in 1646 . The church , the centre of the community , [MASK]as restored in 1714 and again in 1853 . The ima[MASK]e of reli[MASK]ious renewal is combined with the image of the London air @-@ raids a[MASK]d the constant fighting and destruction withi[MASK] the world . This c[MASK]mpound image is used[MASK]to discuss the connecti[MASK]n of holy places with the Holy Spirit , [MASK]entecost , communi[MASK]n with[MASK]the d[MASK]ad , and the repetition of history . Th[MASK] theme is also internal to Eliot 's own poems ; the image of the rose garden at the end Little Gid[MASK]ing is the image that begins Burnt[MASK]Norton and the journey is made circular . Also [MASK] the depiction of time within the poem is s[MASK]milar [MASK]o the way time operates within The Family Reunion . [MASK] Like the other poems making up the Fou[MASK] Quartets , Litt[MASK]e Gidding deals with the past , present , and future[MASK], and humanity 's place within them as each generati[MASK]n is seemingly united . In the second section , there is a ghost who is t[MASK]e compilation o[MASK] various poets , including Dante , Swift , Yeats , and others . When the ghost[MASK]joins the poet , the narrator states " Knowing myself yet [MASK]eing someone other " . This suggests that the different times merge at the same time that the different personalities[MASK]begin to merge [MASK] allowing a communicati[MASK]n and connection with the dead . Later , in the fourth section , humanity is given a choice between the Holy Spirit or the bombing [MASK]f London ; [MASK]edemption or dest[MASK]uction . God 's love allows humankind to be redeemed and escape the living hell throu[MASK]h purgation by fire . The end of the poem describes how Eliot has attempted to help th[MASK] world as a poet . He parallels his work in language with working on the soul or working on society . 
 The ghost[MASK], a combination of many liter[MASK]ry figures , was origina[MASK]ly addressed in the poem as " Ser Brunetto " before being revised as an amb[MASK]guous " you " . " Ser Brunetto " was Dante 's way of [MASK]ddressing Brunetto Latini , a former mentor whom he meets in Hell to which he has been condemne[MASK] for sodomy . Eliot , in a let[MASK]er to John Hayward dated 27 August 1942 , explained why he changed the wording : 
 I think you will recognise that it was necessary to get rid of [MASK]runetto for two reasons . The first is that the v[MASK]sionary figure has now become somewhat more definite and will no doubt be identified by some readers with Yeats though I do not mean anything so precise as that . Howev[MASK]r , I do not wish to tak[MASK] the responsibility of putting Yeats or anybody else into Hell[MASK]and I do not want to impute to [MASK]im the particular vice which took Brunetto there . Secondly , although the reference to that Canto is intended to be explicit , I wish the effect of the[MASK]whole[MASK]to be Pu[MASK]gatorial wh[MASK]c[MASK] is more appropriate . That brings u[MASK] to the reference to swimmi[MASK]g in fire which you will remem[MASK]er at the end of Pur[MASK]atorio 26 where the poet[MASK] ar[MASK] found[MASK]. 
 The theme of swimming through flames is connected to the depiction [MASK]f Guido Guinizelli , a poet that [MASK]nfluenced Dante , seeking such a state in Purgatorio XXVI . However , the depiction of swimming was transformed into an image [MASK]f dancing , an act that appear[MASK] throughout Yeats 's poetry , within purgatori[MASK]l [MASK]lames . The critic Dominic Manganiello suggests that , in combining the image[MASK]of dancing with purgation , Eliot merges Dante 's and Y[MASK]ats 's poetic themes . 
 
 = = Receptio[MASK] = = 
 [MASK] Critics such as Malcolm Cowley and Delmore Schwartz describe m[MASK]xed emotions about the religiosity of the poem . Cowley emphasised the myst[MASK]cal nature of the poem and how its themes were closer to Buddhism than Angli[MASK]anism while mentioning his appreciation of many of the passages . Schwartz also mentioned the Buddhis[MASK] images an[MASK] his admiration for many of the lines in Little Gidding . F. B. Pinion believed that the fourth section of the poem costs " Eliot[MASK]more trouble and vexation than any passage of the same [MASK]ength he ever wrote , and is his g[MASK]eatest achievement in the Four Quartets . " E. M. Forster did [MASK]ot like Eliot[MASK]'s emphasis on pain and responded to the poem : " Of[MASK]course there 's[MASK]pain on and off through each individual '[MASK] life ... You can 't shirk it[MASK]and so on . But why should it be endorsed by the schoolmaster and sanctified by t[MASK]e priest until the fire and the rose [MASK]r[MASK] one when so much[MASK]of it is caused by disease and bullies ? It is here that Eliot becomes unsatisfactory [MASK]s a seer . " Writing in 2003 , Roger Scruton wrote that in " Little Gidding " Eliot achieved " that for which he envies Dante — namely , a poetry [MASK]f belief , in w[MASK]ich belief and words are one , and in which the thought cannot be prized free from the controlled and beautif[MASK]l language " .

 The Por[MASK]age to San Cristobal of A.H. is a 1981 literary and philos[MASK]phical novella by[MASK]George Steiner , in which Jewish Nazi hunters find a fictional Adolf Hitler[MASK]( A.H. ) alive in the Amazon jungle thirty years after[MASK]the end of World War II . The book generated considerable co[MASK]troversy af[MASK]er its publication bec[MASK]use in it , Steiner , who is Jewish , allows Hitler to defend himself when he is put on trial in the jungle by[MASK]his captors . There Hitler ma[MASK]ntains that Israel owes its existence to the Holocaust and tha[MASK] he is the " benefac[MASK]or of the Jews " . 
 The Portage to San Cristobal of A.H. was a 1983 finalist in the PEN / Faulkner Award [MASK]or Fiction . It was[MASK]adap[MASK][MASK]d for the theatre by Bri[MASK]ish playwright Christopher [MASK]ampton and was staged in London in April 198[MASK] with[MASK]Alec McCowen playing the part of Adol[MASK] Hitler . I[MASK] was also staged in Hartford , Conne[MASK]ticut in the United [MASK]tates i[MASK] 1983 and starred John Cullum as Hitler . 
 
 = = Plot summary = = 
 
 From his base in Tel Aviv , Holocaust survivor Emmanuel Lieber directs a group of Jewish Nazi hunters in search[MASK]of Adolf Hitler . Lieber believ[MASK]s that the former Führer is still alive , and following rumours and hearsay [MASK] he tracks Hit[MASK]er 's movements through South America , until after months of wading through swamps in the Amazon jungle , the search party finds the 90 @-@ year @-@ old alive in a clearing . Lieber flies to San Cristóbal where he awaits the group 's return with their captive . But [MASK][MASK]tting the old man out of the jungle alive is more difficult than getting in , and their progres[MASK] is further hampered by heavy thunderstorms . 
 Meanwhile , broken and incoherent radio messages between Lieber and the sea[MASK][MASK]h party are intercepted by intelligence agents trac[MASK]ing thei[MASK] progress , and rumours begin[MASK]to spread across the world of Hitler 's capture . Debates flare up over h[MASK]s impending trial , where it will be held a[MASK]d under whose jurisdiction . O[MASK]osso is identified as the nearest ai[MASK]field to[MASK]the last known location of the search[MASK]party , and aircr[MASK]ft begin arriving at the hitherto unknown town . But when the search part[MASK] loses radio contact with Lieber , they must make a d[MASK]cis[MASK]on : d[MASK] they sit out the storms and deliver their captive to Lieber later , or do they try Hitler in the jungle before their prize is snatched from them by the world at large , who they know will be waiting ? Their decision is the latte[MASK] , and against Lieber 's advice ( " Y[MASK]u must[MASK]not let him speak ... his tongue is like no other " ) they prepare fo[MASK] a trial wit[MASK][MASK][MASK] judge , prosecution and defence[MASK]attorneys selected from the members of th[MASK] search party . Teku , a local Indian tracker , is asked to observe the trial as an independent witness . 
 The attention Hitler is rec[MASK]iving , however , renews his strength , and when the trial begins , he brushes aside his " defence attorney " and begins a long speech in four parts i[MASK] his own defence : 
 Firstly , Hitler claims he took [MASK]is doctrines from the J[MASK]ws and copied the not[MASK]on of the master race from the Chosen people and their need to separate themselves from the " unclean " . " My racism is a parody of yours [MASK] a hungry imitation . " [MASK] Hitler justifies the Final Solution by maintaining that the [MASK]ews ' God , purer than any othe[MASK] , [MASK]nslaves its subjects , continually demanding more than they can give and " blackmailing " them with ideals that [MASK]annot be attained . The " virus of utop[MASK]a " had to be stopped . 
 Hitler states that he[MASK]was not the origin[MASK]tor of evil . " [ Stalin ] had perfected genocide when I was still a[MASK]nameless scribbler in Munich . " Further , Hitler asserts that t[MASK]e [MASK]umber of lives lost due to his actions are dwarfed by various world atrocities , including those in Russia , China and Af[MASK]ica . 
 Lastly , Hitler maintains that the Reich begat[MASK]I[MASK]rael and suggests tha[MASK] he is the Messiah " whose infamous deeds were allowed by God in order to[MASK]bring His people[MASK]home . " He closes by asking , " Should you n[MASK]t honour me who have made ... Zion[MASK]a reality ? " 
 At the end of his speech , Teku is the first to react and jumps up[MASK]shouting " Proven " , on[MASK]y to be drowned out by the appearance of a helicopter over the clearing .

 George Steiner , literary critic for The New Yorker and The New York Times , had written about the Holocaust in some of his previous books , including Anno Domini ( 1964 ) , Language and Silence ( 1[MASK]67 ) and In Bluebe[MASK]rd 's Cast[MASK]e ( 19[MASK]1 ) . Many of the ideas Steiner expres[MASK]es in The Portage to San Cristobal of A.H. were reworke[MASK] from these earlie[MASK] works . Steiner told Ne[MASK] York Times editor D. J. R. Bruckner that this book [MASK]rose o[MASK]t of his lifelong work on language . " Cen[MASK]ral to everything I am and believe and [MASK]ave written is my astonishment ... that[MASK]you can use human speech both to bless , to love , to build[MASK], to forgive and also to torture , [MASK]o hate , to destroy and to annihilate[MASK]. " 
 Commenting on the controversy the book generated[MASK], Steine[MASK] adm[MASK]tted to literary journalist and critic Ron Rosenbaum ( author of Explaining Hitler ) that he too was disturbed b[MASK] it , adding that his fictional Hitler had gotten the better of him , " golem- or Frankenstein @-@ like " . He said that it felt like the[MASK]book " w[MASK]ote me " . Steiner also pointed out that t[MASK]e novella is not only about his thoughts on the Holocaust , but also about the horrific events that took place in countries like Cambodia , Vietnam , El Salvador and Burundi : " My feeling is that one has to grapple with the abyss if one can . " 
 [MASK]teiner wrote The Portage to San Cri[MASK]tobal of [MASK].H. in 1975 and 1976 in Geneva , Switzerland , and [MASK]he 120 @-@ p[MASK]ge work originally appeared in the Spring 1979 issue of t[MASK]e United States litera[MASK]y maga[MASK]ine , The Kenyon Review . It also appeared in the Spring 1980 issue of Granta , the British literary maga[MASK]ine . Its first publication in book form , with minor revisions by Steiner , was in May 1981 by Faber and Faber [MASK]n the United Kingdom — and as requested by Steiner , it was[MASK]a paperback original . The first United States edition was published in hardcover in April 1982 by Simon & Schuster .

[MASK]
 Reaction to The Portage to San Cristobal of A.H. was mixed . Anthon[MASK] Burgess in The Observer called it " astonishing " , Christopher B[MASK]oker of The Daily Telegraph described it as [MASK] " powerful piece " , and English author A. S. Byatt said it was a " masterpiece " . In Explai[MASK]ing Hitle[MASK] , Ron Rosenbaum called The Portage " A Frankenstein story " , referring to Steiner 's ficti[MASK]e Hitler has having taken on a [MASK]ife of its own . Writing in Time maga[MASK]ine , Otto Friedrich described the book " a philosophic fantasy of remarkable intensity " , adding t[MASK]at by not refuting Hitler 's speech , Steiner deviates from the horrors of traditional Holocaust literature and ends the[MASK]book [MASK] [MASK]n a note of bleak ambiguity " . 
 Morris Dickstein of The New York Times was[MASK]more cri[MASK]ical of the book , calling it " a misconceived and badly executed novel , a sid[MASK]show distrac[MASK]ion from the serious business of thinking through[MASK]the [MASK]nspeakable horrors of the Nazi era . " [MASK]e described it as " wearisome " that is " suffocate [ d ] " by too much " fine writing " ( belles @-@ lettres ) . He[MASK]also complained[MASK]that the characters are lifeless , and while they each have detailed histories , they are only " verb[MASK]l figments " that do not separate them from one another . Finally Dickstein noted that because almost all the points of Hitler '[MASK] speech are drawn from som[MASK] of Stei[MASK]er 's ear[MASK]ier works , he " unwitting[MASK]y creates sym[MASK]athy for Hi[MASK]ler by making him old and pathetic yet also lucid and brilliant — at once absurdly harmless and u[MASK]convincingly dangerous . " 
 In another[MASK]review in The New[MASK]York Times John Leonard wrote that while the book has[MASK]its[MASK]strong points , " some wit , a catho[MASK]ic disdain , mu[MASK]tiplicity of character and a [MASK]outh American swamp @-@ life that terrifies " , its [MASK]eaknesses [MASK]re that " the characters are really ideas , ... the symbols clash a[MASK]d there are too many echoes of better books by Kafka and Proust " .[MASK]But Leonard 's bi[MASK]gest cri[MASK]icism of the book was Hitler 's speech , which he called " obscene " , and Steiner 's decision to end th[MASK] book at that point , which Leonard sai[MASK] " not only denies the power of art to arrange and transcend [MASK] but ... makes me sick to my [MASK]tomach . " 
 Writing in the American li[MASK]erary magazine Salmagundi , A[MASK]vin H. Rosenfe[MASK]d called The Por[MASK]age a " breakthrou[MASK]h w[MASK]rk " that " a[MASK]tonishes [MASK] . He was struck by the book 's interplay between the landscape of swamp and jungle , and the " landscape of speech " — the former being " brilliantly registered " with its " immense feeling of physicality " , and the lat[MASK]e[MASK] , " e[MASK]en more dramatic " in the way it exposes " the da[MASK]k underside of words " and how its use a[MASK]d misuse rev[MASK]als the t[MASK]ue nature of a person . He was particularly impressed by the depiction of Nazi h[MASK]nter Emmanuel Lieber and his role as representative of the Jewish consciousness . Rosenfeld noted that while Holocau[MASK]t literature often ei[MASK]her[MASK]soars to " expostulation and ap[MASK]strophe " , or sinks to " a dwindling sob of eleg[MASK]ac lament " , Steiner 's Lieber " m[MASK][MASK]iates b[MASK]tween the[MASK]e two extremes , .[MASK]. simultaneously records and mourns , coldly enumerates yet carries [MASK]n immense affect " . What did concern the reviewer , however , was the way Steiner used ideas from his earlier works , that he had put them " virtu[MASK]lly verbatim " into [MASK]itler 's mouth , creating the impression that " Steiner 's understanding of Hitler were identical with the latter 's self @-@ understanding " . Ros[MASK]nfeld also quest[MASK]oned why the book had to end with Hitler 's speech . He said that Steiner 's fictive Hitler plays " the devil 's game of language subversion " , making " madness [ sound ] like music " , something the real Hitler had perfected . By sto[MASK]ping at this po[MASK]nt , Rosenfel[MASK] felt that Steiner " succumb [ s ] , rhetorically , [MASK]o the seduct[MASK]ve eloquence of negation " , which undermines his own " high standards of moral intelligence " . But overall Rosenfeld said[MASK]The [MASK]ortage " mus[MASK] be cou[MASK]ted among the most vigorous attempts to portray the [MASK]resence and meaning of Hitler " , forcing us to confront him " in a[MASK]way hardly seen before in fiction " . 
 The Po[MASK]tage to San Cristobal of A.H. was a finalist [MASK]n the 1983 PEN / Faulkner Award for Fiction . 
 
 = = Controversy = = 
 
 The bo[MASK]k generated considerable controversy because of its apparent " admiration for Hitler " . The controversy grew further when the faithful stage adaptation ( " too faithful " , according to Steiner ) was p[MASK]rformed in the United Kingdom and the United[MASK]States . 
 Hitler 's speech at the end of the book disturbe[MASK] many readers and critics . Steiner not only[MASK]lets[MASK]Hitler justify his past , he allows him t[MASK]e ( almost ) last word before the outside [MASK]orld invades . The fact that Steiner is Jewish made this speech in particular eve[MASK] more contentious . [MASK]ne critic , while acknowledging that Steiner always saw Hitl[MASK]r as " the inc[MASK]rnation of unprecedented and unpa[MASK]alleled evil " , felt that there was no clear[MASK]distinction in the book between Steiner 's own views and those of his fictional Hitler , even going so far as to accuse Steiner , who rejects Jewish nationalism and is a critic of Israel 's treatment of the Palestinians , of anti @-@ Semitism . 
 In contrast , a Time magazine article at the time felt that Steiner 's intention for the Hitler speech was to use it to explore his previously stated belief " that Hi[MASK]ler wielded language as an almost supernatura[MASK] force " , drawing attention to Nazi hunter Emmanuel Lieber 's warning from the book regarding Hitler : " There shall come a man who ... will know the grammar of hell and teach it to others [MASK] He [MASK]ill know the sounds of madness and loathing and make them seem music . " 
 Steiner responded to criticism that Hitler 's speech in this book is unchallenged by saying th[MASK]t it[MASK]had [MASK]een done before : for exa[MASK][MASK]le Satan 's speech in Milton 's Paradise Lost ( 1667 ) , and The Grand Inquisitor 's speech in Dostoyevsky 's The Brothers Karamazov ( 1880 ) . He also reminded the reader that Hitler 's speech is balanced out earlier in the book by Lieber 's long monologue on the horrors of the Holocaust [MASK] Finally , Steiner said that his Hitler ( A. H. ) is " a fictive figure " , and that it is no[MASK] [MASK]e who has the last word , but Teku , the Indian tracker , who shouts " Proven " . Teku is also the Hebrew word used to indicate t[MASK]at " there are issues here b[MASK]yond our wisdom to answer or decide . " 
 
 
 = Temnospondyli = 
 
 Temnospondyli ( from Greek τέ[MASK]νειν ( temnein , " to cut " ) and σπόνδυλος ( spondylos , " vertebra [MASK] ) ) is a divers[MASK] subclass of extinct small to [MASK]iant tetrapods — often c[MASK]nsidered primitive amphibians — that flourished world[MASK]ide during the Carboniferous , Permian , and Triass[MASK]c periods . A few species continued into the Cretaceous . Fossils have been found on e[MASK]ery continent . During about 210 million years of evolutionary history , they ada[MASK]ted to a wide range of habitats , incl[MASK]ding fresh wat[MASK]r , terrestri[MASK]l , and even coastal marine environments . Their life history is well understood , with fossils kn[MASK]wn from the larval stage[MASK], metamorphosis , and maturity . Most temnospondyls were semiaquatic , although some were almost fully terrestrial , returning[MASK]to the water only to breed . Th[MASK]se temnospondyls were some of the first vertebrates fully adapted to life on land . Although [MASK]emnospondyls are considered amphi[MASK]ians ,[MASK]many had chara[MASK]te[MASK]istics , such as scales , claws , and ar[MASK]our @-@ like bony plates , that distinguish them from modern amphibians . 
 Temnospondyls have been known since the early 19th century , and we[MASK]e initially thought to be reptiles . They were described at various times as b[MASK]trachians , stegocephalians , and labyrinthodonts , although these names are now rarely used . Animals now grouped in Temnospondyli were spread out amo[MASK]g several amphibian groups until the early 20th century , when they were f[MASK]und to belong[MASK]to a distinct taxon based on the structure of thei[MASK] vertebrae . Temnospondyli means " cut vertebrae " , as each vertebra is divided into several parts . 
 Experts disagree over whether temnospondyls were ancestral to moder[MASK] amphibians ( frogs , salamanders[MASK], and ca[MASK]cilians ) , or whether the[MASK]whole group died out without lea[MASK]ing any descendants . Different hypoth[MASK]ses have placed modern amph[MASK]bians as the desce[MASK]dants of temnospondyls , another group of early [MASK]etrapods called lepospondyls , or even as descendants of [MASK][MASK]th groups ( with caecilians evolving from lepospondyls and frogs and salamanders evolving from temnospondyls ) . Recent studies [MASK]lace a family of temnospondyls called the amphibamids [MASK]s the closest relatives [MASK]f modern amphibians . Similarities in teeth , skulls , and hearing structures link th[MASK] two groups . 
 
 = = Description = [MASK] 
 
 Many temnospondyls are mu[MASK]h[MASK]larger than living amphibians , and superficially resemble crocodiles . Others are smaller[MASK]and resemble salamanders[MASK]. Most have bro[MASK]d , flat heads that are either blunt ([MASK]brevirostrine ) or elongated ( longirostrine ) . The skulls are rounded or [MASK]riangular in shape when viewed from above , and are usually [MASK]ov[MASK]red in pits and ridges . The rugged surfaces o[MASK] bones may have supp[MASK]rted blood v[MASK]ssels , which could transfer[MASK]carbon dio[MASK]ide to the b[MASK]nes to neutralize acidic build up in the blood ( early semiaquatic tetrapods would have had difficulty expelling carbon dioxide from their bodies wh[MASK]le on land , and these dermal[MASK]bones may have been an early solution to the problem ) . Many temnospond[MASK]ls also[MASK]have[MASK]canal @-@ like grooves in thei[MASK] skulls called sensory sulci . The sulci , which usually ru[MASK] around the nostrils and eye so[MASK]kets , are part of a lateral line system used to detect vibrations in water . As semiaquatic animals , most tem[MASK]os[MASK]ondyls have small limbs with four toes on each front foot and five on each hi[MASK]d foot . Terrestrial[MASK]temnospondyls have larger , thicke[MASK] limbs , and some even have claws . O[MASK]e unusual terrestrial temnospondyl , [MASK]ayella , has relatively long limbs for its body [MASK] and probably lived as an active runner able to chase prey . 
 Homologues o[MASK] most of the bones of temnospondyls are [MASK]ls[MASK] seen in other early tetrapods , aside f[MASK]om a few bones in the skull , such as interfrontals , internasals , an[MASK] [MASK]nterparietals , that have devel[MASK]ped in s[MASK]me temnospondyl taxa . Most temnospondyls have tabul[MASK]r horns in the b[MASK]cks [MASK]f their skulls , rounded projections o[MASK] bon[MASK] separated from the rest of the skull by ind[MASK]ntations called [MASK]tic notches ; in some temnospondyls [MASK] such [MASK]s Zatrachys , they are pointed and very prominent . Among the most distinguishing feat[MASK]res of temnospondyls are the interpterygoid vacuities , two large holes in the back of the palate . Another pair of holes , choanae , are present in front of these vacuities , and connect the nasal passage with [MASK]he m[MASK]uth . [MASK]emnospondyls o[MASK]ten have teeth on their palates , as[MASK]well[MASK]as in their jaws . So[MASK]e o[MASK] these teeth are so large , they are referred to as tusks[MASK]. I[MASK] some temnospondyls , such as Nigerpe[MASK]on , tusks in the lower jaw pierce the palate and [MASK]merge th[MASK]ough openings in the top of the skull . 
 Very little is known of the soft tissue of temnospondyls . A bl[MASK]ck of sandstone , described in 2007 from the Early Carboniferous Mauch Chunk Formation of Pennsylvania , included impressions of the bodies of three temnospondyls . These impressions show , when alive , they had smooth skin , robust limbs with webbed feet , and a ridge of skin on thei[MASK] undersides . Trackways referable to small temnospondy[MASK]s have also been found in Carboniferous and Permian rocks[MASK]. Th[MASK] trackways , [MASK]alled batr[MASK]c[MASK]ichni , are usually found in strata deposited around freshwater environments , suggesting the ani[MASK]als had some ties t[MASK] the water . 
 Unlike modern amphibians , many temnospondyls are covered in small , closely pac[MASK]ed scales . The undersi[MASK]es of most temnospondyls are covered in rows of l[MASK]rge ventral plates . During early stages[MASK]of deve[MASK]opment , they first have only small , rounded scales [MASK] Fossils show , as the animals grew , the scales on the[MASK]undersides of their bodies dev[MASK]loped into large , wide vent[MASK]al plates . The plates overlap each other in a way that allows a wide range of flexibility . Later semiaquatic temnospondyls , such as trem[MASK]tosaurs and capitosaurs , have no evidence of scales . They may have lost scales to make movement e[MASK]sier under water or to allow cutaneo[MASK]s respiration , the absorption of oxy[MASK]en throug[MASK] the skin . 
 Several groups of temnospondyls have large bony plates on their backs . One temnospondyl , Peltobatrachus , has armour @-@ li[MASK]e plating that covers both its back and underside . The temnospondyl L[MASK]idleria also has extensive plating on its back . Most memb[MASK]rs of the family Dissorophidae also [MASK]ave armo[MASK] , although it only covers the midline of the back with two[MASK]narrow rows of plates . Other temnospondyls , such as Eryops , have been found with small , disc @-@ like bony scutes that were in life probably embedded in the skin . All of these temnospond[MASK]ls were adapted to a terrestrial lifestyle . Armor may have offered[MASK]protection from predators in t[MASK]e case of Peltobatrachus . The scutes may h[MASK]ve provided stability for the[MASK]spine , as they would hav[MASK] limited flexibility[MASK]and may have been connec[MASK]ed by strong ligaments . Temnospondyls such as Sclerothorax and Eryops that may have been at least partly terres[MASK]rial also have long neural spines on to[MASK] o[MASK] their vertebrae that would have st[MASK]bilize[MASK] the spine . Bony s[MASK]utes are also seen in plagiosaurs , but [MASK]nlike Peltobatrachus , Laidleria , Eryops , and dissorophids , these animals are thought to have[MASK]been [MASK]ully aquatic . Plagiosaurs may have inherited t[MASK]eir armor from a terrestrial ancestor , as both Peltobatrachus and Laidleria have been considered c[MASK]ose relatives of the group . 
 Temnospondyls ' vertebrae[MASK]are divided into several segments . In li[MASK]ing tetrapods , the main body of the vertebra is a single[MASK]piece of bone called the centrum , but in temnospondyls , this region was divided into a pleurocentrum and intercentrum . Tw[MASK] types of vertebrae are recognized in temnospondyls : stereospondylous and rhachitomous vertebrae . In [MASK]hachitomous vertebrae , the intercentra are large and wedge @-@ shaped , a[MASK]d the pleurocentra are relatively small blocks that fit between them . Both elements support a spine @-@ like neural arch , and well @-[MASK] developed interlockin[MASK] projec[MASK]ions called zygapophyses[MASK]strengthen the connections between v[MASK][MASK]tebrae . The strong backbone and strong limbs of many ratchitomous temnospondyls allowed them to be partially , and in some cases fully , terrestrial . In stere[MASK]spondylous vertebrae , the pleurocentra have been lost entirely , with the intercentra enlarged as the main body o[MASK] the vertebrae . Thi[MASK] weaker type of backbone indicates the [MASK]tereospondylous t[MASK]mnospondyls spent more time in water .

 Temnospondyli was named by German palaeontologist Karl Alfred von Zittel in his second edition of Handbuch der[MASK]Palaeonto[MASK]ogie , published in [MASK]888 . Temnospondyl remains were known si[MASK]ce the early part of the 19th century , however . The e[MASK]rliest described temnos[MASK]ondyl was Mastodonsaurus [MASK] named by Georg Friedri[MASK]h Jaeger in 1828 . Jaeger named Mastodonsaur[MASK]s from a single toot[MASK] , and considered it a [MASK]eptile . Mastodonsaurus means[MASK]" breast tooth lizard " after the nipple @-@ like shape of the tip of the tooth . 
 The naming of these first speci[MASK]ens was disputed , however . Leo[MASK]old Fitzinger named the animal Batrachosaurus in 1837 . In 1841 , En[MASK]lish palaeontologist Richard Owen referred to the genus as Labyrinthodon to describe its highly folded or labyrinthine teeth . Owen thou[MASK]h[MASK] the name Mastodonsauru[MASK] " ought n[MASK]t to be retained , because it reca[MASK]ls unavoidably the idea of the mammalian genus Mastodon , or else a m[MASK]mmilloid form of the tooth ... and because the second element of the word , saurus , indicates a false affin[MASK]ty ,[MASK]the remains belonging , not to the[MASK]Saurian , but to th[MASK] Batrachian order of Reptiles . " Owen recognized the animal was not a " saurian " [MASK]eptile , y[MASK]t he also[MASK]referred Jaeg[MASK]r 's Phytosaurus to the genus . Although the two genera [MASK]oth have similarly sized conical teeth , Phytosaurus was later found to be a crocodile @-@ like re[MASK]tile . Additional material , including skulls , firmly placed Labyrinthodon as an amphibian . Jaeger also named Salama[MASK]droides giganteus[MASK]in 1828 ,[MASK]basing it on partial occiput , or [MASK]ack portion of the skull . In 1833 , he descr[MASK]bed a complete skull of S. gi[MASK]anteus that had the same teet[MASK] as his Mast[MASK]donsaurus , making it the first known complete skull of a temnospondyl . Because Mastodonsaurus was named first , it has precedence over the other names as a senior subjectiv[MASK] synonym . Batrachosaur[MASK]s is still used as the name of an unrelated brachyopid temnospondyl . 
 Mastodonsaurus and other similar ani[MASK]als were referred to as labyrinthodonts , named like Labyrinthodon for teeth that were highly folded in cross section . Owen 's " Labyrinthodon Jaegeri " was l[MASK]ter found a[MASK] Guy 's Cliffe , England[MASK]by paleontologist William Buckland . Other specime[MASK]s were found in the red s[MASK]ndstone of Warwickshire . As more fossils were uncovered in England , Owen depicted these labyrinthodonts as the " highest " form of batrachian and co[MASK]pared them to crocodiles , which he considered the highest form[MASK]of reptiles . He also noted the large labyrinthodonts of the Keuper ( a unit of rocks that dates to the Late Triassic ) were younger than more advanced reptiles in the Magnesian and Zechstein , which are Late Permian [MASK]n age . Owen used these [MASK]ossils to counter the notion that reptiles evolved from a[MASK]sequenti[MASK]l progression from earl[MASK] amphibians ( what he c[MASK]lled " metamorphosed fishes " ) . 
 In addition to Mastodonsau[MASK]us , some [MASK]f the earliest named genera included Metopias and Rhombopholis in 1842 , Zygosaurus in 1848 , Trematosaurus in 1849 , B[MASK]phetes and Den[MASK]rerpeton in 1853 , Capitosaurus in 1858 , and Dasyceps in 1859 . Baphetes is now placed as an early tetrapod outside Temnospondyli , [MASK]nd Rhombopholis i[MASK] now considered a prolacertiform reptile . 
 Later in the 19th century , temnospondyls were classi[MASK]ied as various members of Stegocephalia , a name coined by American paleontologist Edward Drinker Cope in 1868 . Cope placed stego[MASK]ephalians in the class Batrachia , the name then used for Amphibia . Stegocephalia means [MASK] roof @-@ headed " [MASK]n Greek , a reference to the wide , flat heads of temno[MASK]pondyls and other ea[MASK]ly tetrapods . During this time , palaeontologists considered temnospondyls to be amphibians because they possess[MASK]d three main f[MASK]atures : gi[MASK]l arches in juvenile skeletons , indicating they were amphibious for at leas[MASK] the first part of their[MASK]lives ; rib[MASK] that do not connect at the underside of the rib cage [MASK] and deep pits in the skull that were interpreted as space for mucou[MASK] glands . 
 Several suborders of stegoc[MASK][MASK]halians were recognized in the late 19th and early 20th centuries . Anim[MASK]ls now regarded as temnospondyls were primarily labyrinthodonts , but some we[MASK]e classified in the Branchiosauria . Branchiosaurs were small @-@ bodied and had simple conical teeth , while [MASK]aby[MASK]inthodonts were la[MASK]ger and had complex , [MASK]olded dentin and enamel in their tee[MASK]h . Branchiosauria included only a few forms , such as Branchiosaurus from Eur[MASK]pe a[MASK]d Amphibamus from North America [MASK] that had poorly developed bones , external gills , and no ribs . Some [MASK]keletons of Amphibamus were later found with long ribs , prompting its reassignment to Microsauria ( although more detailed studies found it to b[MASK] a temn[MASK]spondyl ) . Soft tissue , such as scales and external gills , were found i[MASK] many well @-@ preserved branchi[MASK]saur fossils fro[MASK] Germany . In the early 20th century , branchiosaurs would be recognized as larval forms of temnospondyls lacking many of the typical features that defin[MASK] the gro[MASK]p , and is no longer recognized as a distinct group . 
 Other animals that would later be class[MASK]fied as tem[MASK]ospond[MASK]ls were placed in a group[MASK]called Ganocephala , characterized[MASK]by plate @-[MASK] like skull bones , small lim[MASK]s , fish @-@ like scales , and branchial arches . Unlike labyrinthodonts , they did not have parietal for[MASK]mena , small holes in thei[MASK] skulls behind their[MASK]eye socket[MASK] . Archegosaurus[MASK], Dendrerpeton , Eryops and Trimerorhachis were placed in this group and were considered to be the most primi[MASK]ive members of Reptilia . Their rhachitomous vertebrae , notoc[MASK]ord , and lack of oc[MASK]ip[MASK]tal condyles ( which attached [MASK]he head to t[MASK]e n[MASK]ck )[MASK]we[MASK]e features that were also shared with fishes . Thus , they were considered a link between early fishes and [MASK]ore advanced forms such as stegocephal[MASK]an[MASK] . 
 Another g[MASK]oup called Microsauria was named by Cope in 1868 . Cope class[MASK]fied Micro[MASK]auria as [MASK] subgroup of Labyrinthodontia , placing many small , amphibian @-@ like a[MASK]imals within it[MASK]. Am[MASK]ng them were Dendrerpeton , once placed in Ganocephala . Dendrerpeton was later placed as a labyrinthodo[MASK]t with other temn[MASK]spondyl[MASK] , bu[MASK][MASK]c[MASK]nfusion existed for many years over the classification of small amphibians . 
 By the[MASK]end of the 19th century , most of what are today rega[MASK]ded as temnospondyls we[MASK]e placed in [MASK]he suborder Labyrinthodonta . American paleontologist Ermine Cowles Case called it Labyrinthodonta vera or " true labyrinthodonts " . The names Stegocephalia and Labyrinthodontia were used interchangeably to refer to the order in which it belonged . The labyrinthodontian suborders Microsauria and Branchiosauria , both of which contain t[MASK]mnospondyls , were distinct from Labyrinthodonta . [MASK][MASK]thin Labyrinthodonta were the groups Rhachitomi , Labyrinthodonti , and E[MASK]bolerimi . Members of Rhachitomi ,[MASK]such as Archegosaurus and Eryops , had [MASK]hachitomous vertebrae with enlarged inter[MASK]entra that displaced the pleuroce[MASK]tra . Labyrinthodonti , such as Mastodonsaurus , Trematosaurus , and Micropholis , had lost their pleurocentra , and the intercentra mad[MASK] up the entire body of the vertebra[MASK] . Embolerimi had intercentra and pleurocentra that were[MASK]of equal size . Embolomeres are now identified a[MASK] re[MASK]tiliom[MASK]rphs distantly related to temnospondyls . 
 In 1888 [MASK] von Zittel divided stegocephalians among thr[MASK]e taxa : L[MASK]pospondyli , Temnospondyli ,[MASK]and Stereospondyli . He placed micro[MASK]aurs in Lepospondyli , a group w[MASK]ich he characterized as having simple , spool @-@ shaped vertebral centra . Temno[MASK]pondyli included forms with the centra divided in[MASK][MASK][MASK]pleurocentra and intercentra . All members of Stereospondyli had amphicoelous centra composed only o[MASK] the intercentra . Cope objected to von Zittel 's classification , considering the vertebrae of[MASK]lepospondyls and stereospondyls indistinguish[MASK]ble because eac[MASK] had a si[MASK]ple spool shape [MASK] He continued to use Ganocephala and L[MASK]b[MASK]rinthodonta ( which he alternative[MASK]y referred to as Rhachitomi ) [MASK]o distinguish animals[MASK]based on the absence or presence of occipital condyles . 
 Temnospondyli beca[MASK]e a commonly used name at the turn of the century . Paleontologists inc[MASK]uded both embolomeres and rhachitomes in the group . Cope 's Ga[MASK]ocephala an[MASK] Labyrinth[MASK]donta fell out of use . In 19[MASK]9 , British paleontologist D. M. S. Watson proposed tha[MASK] the evolutionary hi[MASK]tory of these large amphibians could be seen through changes in their vertebrae . Embolomerous forms in[MASK]the Carboniferous graded into rhachitomous forms in the Permian , and finally into stereospondyls in the Triassic . More importa[MASK]tly , Watson began using the term Labyrinthodontia to refer to these groups . T[MASK]e name Temnospondyli was rarely used in the decades that[MASK]followed . Swedish paleontologist Gunnar Säve @-@ Söderbergh removed embolomeres from the group , narrowing its scope to rhachitomes and stereospondyls . His classification of labyrinthodonts was[MASK]b[MASK]se[MASK][MASK]heavily on characteristics of the skull rather than the vertebrae . 
 Americ[MASK]n pa[MASK]eontologist Alfr[MASK]d Romer brought the name Temnospondyli back into use in the later 20th century . Säve @-@ S[MASK]derbergh used the name Labyrinthodontia in a [MASK]tri[MASK]t sense ( sensu stricto ) to refer to Rhach[MASK]tomi and Stereospondyli , ex[MASK]luding[MASK]Embolomeri .[MASK]Romer agreed with this classification , but used the name Temnospondyli to avoid confusion with Labyrinthodontia in its wid[MASK]r sense ( sensu lato ) . Unlik[MASK] modern temnospondyl classification , however , Romer included the p[MASK]imitive Icht[MASK]yostegalia in the group .

 Temnospondyls first appeared [MASK]n the Early Carbonifero[MASK]s around 330 [MASK]illion years ago [MASK] Mya ) . During the Carbonife[MASK]ous , temnospondyls included basal medium @-@ sized forms such as Dendrerpeton or large semiaquatic forms such as Cochleosaurus . Other , more derived temnospondyls , [MASK]uch as the amphibami[MASK]s , were smaller and more terrestrial . [MASK]hey rese[MASK]bled salamanders , and so[MASK]e taxa , such as the genus Branchiosaurus , even ret[MASK]ined external gil[MASK][MASK] like the modern @-@ day axolotl . During the latest Carboniferous and Early Permian around 300 Mya , several groups , such as the dissorophids and trematopids evolved strong , robust limbs and vertebrae and became adapted to life on land while others such as the er[MASK]opids , developed into large semiaquatic predators . The dvinosaurs , a grou[MASK] of small aquatic temnospondyls , evolved from terrestrial ancestors in the Late Carboniferous . 
 
 = = =[MASK]Late Permian = = = 
 
 During the Late Permian , increasing aridity and the[MASK]diversification of reptiles contrib[MASK]ted [MASK]nto a decline in terrestrial temnos[MASK]ond[MASK]ls , but semiaquatic and fully aquatic temnospondyls continued to flourish , including the large Melosaurus of Eastern Europe . Other temnospondyls , such as [MASK]rchegosaurids [MASK] developed long snouts and a close similarity to crocodiles [MASK] although they lacked the armor characteristic of the latter group . These temnospondyls included the largest known a[MASK]phibi[MASK]n , the 9 @-@ m @-@[MASK]long Prionosuchus of Brazil .

 As temnospondyls continu[MASK]d to flourish and diversify in the Late Permian ( 260 @.@ 4 - 251 @.@ 0 Mya ) , a major gro[MASK]p called Stereospondyli became [MASK]ore dependent on life in the water . The vertebrae became weak , the limbs small , and the skull large and flat , with the eyes facing upwards . During the Triassic peri[MASK]d , these animals d[MASK]m[MASK]nat[MASK]d[MASK]the freshw[MASK]ter ecosystems , evolv[MASK]ng in a range of both s[MASK]all and large forms . During the Early Triassic ( 251 @.@ 0 - 245 @.@ 0 My[MASK] ) one group of successful long @-@ snouted fish @-@ eaters , the trematosauroids , even adapted to a life in the sea , the only known amphibians to do so with the exception of t[MASK]e modern[MASK]crab @-@ ea[MASK]ing frog . Anoth[MASK]r group , the capitosauroids , included medium- and large @-@ [MASK]ized animals 2 @.@ 3 to 4 m ( 7 @.@ 5 to 13 @.@ 1 ft ) in length , with large a[MASK]d flat skulls that could be over a met[MASK]r long in the largest forms such as Mastodonsaurus . These animals spent most or all their lives in water as aqu[MASK]tic predators , catching the[MASK]r prey by a sudden opening of the upper jaw and sucking in fish [MASK][MASK] other small animals . 
 In the Carnian stage of the Late [MASK]riassic ( 228 @.@ 0 - 216 @.@ 5 Mya ) , capitosauroids were joined by the [MASK]uperficially very similar Metoposauridae . Metoposaurids are distinguished from capitosauroids by the positioning of their eye sockets near the front of their skull[MASK] .[MASK]Another group of stereospondyls , the plagiosaurs ,[MASK]had wide heads with exter[MASK]al gills , and adapted t[MASK] life a[MASK][MASK]the bottom of lakes a[MASK]d rivers . By this time , temnospondyls had become a common and widespread component of semiaquatic ecosystems . Some temnospondyls , such as Cryobatrachus an[MASK] Kryostega , even inhabite[MASK] Antarctica , which was covered in temperate forests at the time . 
 Triassic temnospondyls were often the dominant semiaquat[MASK]c animals in their environme[MASK]ts . Large assemblages of metoposaurs with hundreds of individ[MASK]als preserved together have been found in the southwestern Unit[MASK]d States . They have often been int[MASK]rpreted as mass death events caused by droughts in floodplain environments . Recent studies show[MASK]these dense assemblages were instead probably the result of currents accumulatin[MASK] dead ind[MASK]viduals in certain areas . These environments seem to have had little diversity , as they were inhabited almost exclusively by metoposaurs . 
 The [MASK]riassic @-@ Ju[MASK]assic extinction event around 199 @.@ 6 Mya led to the extinction [MASK]f most Mesozoic temnospondyls . The brachyo[MASK]oids[MASK]survived ,[MASK]a[MASK] well as a few capito[MASK]auroids and trematosauroids [MASK] Whil[MASK] the latter two groups soon became extinct , brachyopoids persisted and grew to large sizes during the J[MASK]rassic . Among brachyopoids , the b[MASK]achyopids flourished in China an[MASK] the chigutisaurids became common in Gondwana . The most recent known temnospondyl was the giant chigutisaurid K[MASK]olasuchu[MASK] , known from the Early Cretaceous of Australia . It survived in rift valleys that were too cold in the [MASK]inter for crocodiles that normally would have competed with them . Koolasuchus was one of the largest of the brachyopoids , with a[MASK] estimated weight of 500 kg ( 1 @,@ 100 lb ) .

 [MASK]riginally , temnospondyls were classified according to the [MASK]tructure of the[MASK]r vertebrae . Early[MASK]forms , with compl[MASK]x vertebrae consisting of a number of sepa[MASK]ate elements , were placed in the suborder Rachitomi , and large Triassic aquatic forms with simpler[MASK]ver[MASK]ebrae were placed in th[MASK] suborder Stereos[MASK]ondyli . With t[MASK]e recent growth of phylogenetics , this clas[MASK]ification is no longer viable . The basic rhachi[MASK]omous condition is found in [MASK]any primitive te[MASK]rapods , and is not unique t[MASK] one group of temnospondyls . Moreover , the distinction between rhachitomous and stereospondylous vertebrae is not entirely clear . Some temnospondyls have rhachitomous , semirhachitomous , and sterospondylous vertebrae at different points in the same vertebral column . Oth[MASK]r taxa have in[MASK]ermediate morphologies that do not fit into any category[MASK]. Rachitomi is no longer recognized as a group , but Stereospondyli is still considered valid .

 In one of the earliest phylogenetic analyses of the group , Gardiner ( 1983 ) recognized five char[MASK]cteristics that made Temnospondyli a clade : a bone at the back o[MASK] the skull , the parasphenoid , is connected to another bone on the underside of the skull , the pterygoid ; large openings called int[MASK]rpterygoid vacuities are present between th[MASK] pterygoids ; the stapes ( a bone invo[MASK]ved in hearing ) is[MASK]connected to the parasphenoid and projects upward ; the cle[MASK]thrum , a bone in the pectoral girdle , is thin ; and part of the vertebra called the interdorsal attaches to the neural arch . Addi[MASK]ional features [MASK]ere given by Godfrey et al . ( 1987 ) , including the contact between the postparietal and exoccipital at the bac[MASK] of th[MASK] skull , small projections ( uncinate processes ) on [MASK]he ribs , and a pelvic girdle with each side having a single iliac blade . These shared characteristics are called synapomorphies . 
 Temnosp[MASK]ndyls are placed as basal tetrapods in phylogenetic analyses , with their exac[MASK] positioning varying between studies . Depending on the classification of modern amphi[MASK]ians , they are either included in the crown [MASK]roup Tetrapoda or the stem of Tetrapoda . Crown @-@ group tetrapods are descendants of the most recent common ancestor of all living tetrapods and stem tetrapods are f[MASK]r[MASK]s that are outside the [MASK]rown group . Modern amphibians have rece[MASK]tly been suggested as descendants of temnospondyls , which wou[MASK]d place them within crown Tetrapoda . Below is a c[MASK]adogram from Ruta et al . ( 2003[MASK]) placing Temnospondyli within crown Tetrapoda [MASK] 
 Other[MASK]studies place modern [MASK]mphibians as the descendants [MASK]f lepospondyls and place temnospondyls in a more basal position within the stem of Tetrapoda . Below is a cladogram from Laurin and Reisz ( 1[MASK]99 ) placing Temnospondyli outside crown Tetrapoda : 
 Most phylogenetic [MASK]nalyses of temnospondyl interrelationships focus on individual f[MASK]milies . One of the first broad @-@ scale studies [MASK]f temnospondyl phylogeny was conducted by paleontologist Andrew Milner in 1990 . A 2007 study made a " supertre[MASK] " of all temnospo[MASK][MASK]yl families , combining the f[MASK]mily @-@ level trees of previous studies . The following cladogram is modified from[MASK]Ruta et al . ( 2007 ) : 
 1 Temnospondyli , 2 Edopoidea , 3 Dvinosauria , 4 Euskelia , 5 Eryopoidea [MASK] 6 Dissorophoidea , 7 Limnarc[MASK]ia , 8 Archegosauroidea , 9 Stereospondyli , 10 Rhytidostea , 11 Brachyopoidea , 12 Capitosauria , 13[MASK]T[MASK]em[MASK]tosauria , 14 Metoposauroidea 
 The most basal group of temnospondyls is the superfamily Edopoidea . E[MASK]opoids ha[MASK]e several primitive or plesiomorphic features , including a single occipital condyle and a bone called the inter[MASK]emporal that is absent in other temnospondyls . Edopoid[MASK] include the Late Carboniferous genus Edops and the family Coch[MASK]eosauridae . Dendrerpetontid[MASK]e has also been included in Edopoidea , and is the oldest known temnospondyl [MASK]amily . Balanerpet[MASK]n woodi is the oldest species , having been present over 330 milli[MASK]n years ago during the Viséan stage of the Early Carboniferous . Recent a[MASK]alyses place Dendrerpetontida[MASK] outside Edopoidea in a more derived position . Other [MASK]rimitive temnospondyls include Capetus and Iberospondylus . Saharastega and Nigerpeton , both described in 2005 from Niger , are also primitive yet come from the Late Perm[MASK]an . They are almost 40 million years younger than other basal temnospondyls , implying a long ghost lineage of species that a[MASK]e not yet known in the fossil record . 
 I[MASK] 2000 , paleontologists Adam Yates and Anne Warren produced a revis[MASK]d phylogeny of more derived temnospondyls , naming several [MASK]ew[MASK]cl[MASK]des . Two major clades [MASK]ere Euskeli[MASK] and Limnarchia . Euskelia includes the temnospondyls that were once ca[MASK]led rhachitomes and includes two subfamilies , the Dissorophoidea and [MASK]he Eryopoidea .[MASK]Dissorophoids include small ,[MASK]mostly terrestr[MASK]al temnospondyls that may be t[MASK]e ancestors of modern amphibians . Er[MASK]opoids include larger temnos[MASK]ondyls like Eryops . The second major clade , Limnarchia [MASK] includes most Mesozoic temnospondyls , a[MASK] well as some Perm[MASK]an groups . Within Limnarchia are the superfamily Archegosauroidea and[MASK]the most derived temnospondyls , the stereospo[MASK]dyls . 
 Yates and Warr[MASK]n[MASK]also named Dvinosauria , a clade[MASK]of[MASK]small aquatic temnospondyls from [MASK]he Carboniferous , Permian , and Triassic . They placed Dvinosauria within Li[MASK]narchia , but[MASK]mor[MASK] recent studies disagree on their position . For example , a 2007 [MASK]tudy places them even more basal tha[MASK] eus[MASK]elians , while a 2[MASK]08 study keeps them as basal limnarchians . 
 Within Stereospondyli , Yates and Warren erected two major clades : [MASK]apitosauria and Trematosauria . Capitosaurs include large semiaquatic temnospondyls like Mastodonsaurus with flat heads and eyes near the back of the skull . Trematosaurs include a diversity of temno[MASK]pondyls , including large marine trematosauroids , aquatic plag[MASK]osaurs [MASK] brachyopoids that survived into the Cretaceou[MASK] , and metoposauro[MASK]ds with eyes near the front o[MASK] their heads . In 2000[MASK], paleontologists Rainer Schoch and Andre[MASK] [MASK]ilner named a third major clade of stereospondyls , the Rhytidost[MASK]a . This group incl[MASK]ded more primitive stereospondyls that could not[MASK]be placed in e[MASK]ther Capitosauria or Trematosauri[MASK] , and included grou[MASK]s like Lydekkerinidae , Rhytidosteidae , and Brachyopoidea . While Capitosauria and[MASK][MASK]rematosauria are still widely used , Rhytidoste[MASK] is not often supported as a true clade in recent analyses . Rhytidosteids and [MASK]rachyopoids are now grouped with trematosaurians , but [MASK]ydekkerinids are sti[MASK]l consi[MASK]ere[MASK] to be a primitive family of stereospondyls . 
 A new phylogeny of temnospondyls was offered by paleontologist Rainer Schoch in 2013 . It supported many of the clades [MASK]hat were found by Yates and Warren[MASK], but it did not find s[MASK]pport for their division of derived stereospondyls into Euskelia and Limnarchia . Eryopids were found to be more [MASK]losely related to stereospondyls than to dissorophoids , which were grouped with dvi[MASK]osaurs .[MASK]The clade including Eryopidae [MASK]nd Stereospondyl[MASK]morph[MASK] was named Eryopiformes . In addition , Sc[MASK]och named the clade containing all temnosp[MASK]ndyls except edopoids Eutemnospondyli and reins[MASK]ated t[MASK]e name Rhachitomi for the clade containing [MASK]ll temnospondyls except edopoids and den[MASK]rerpetontids . Below is[MASK]the cladogram [MASK]rom Schoch 's analysis : 
 
 = = = Relationship to modern amphibians = = = 
 
 Modern amphibians ( f[MASK]ogs , salamanders , and caecilians ) are classif[MASK]ed in[MASK]Lissamphibia[MASK]. Liss[MASK]mphibians appear to have arisen in the Permian .[MASK]Molecular [MASK]lock estimates place the first lissamphibian in the Late Carb[MASK]niferous[MASK], but the first member of Batrachia ( frogs and salamanders , but no[MASK] caecilians ) is estimated to have appeared in the Middle Permian using the same technique . Using fossil [MASK]vidence , there are three main theories for the origin of modern amphibians . 
 One is that they evolved from dissorophoid temnospondyls . Another is that they evolved from lepospondyls , most likely the lysorophians . A third hypothesis is that caecilians descended from lepospondyls and frogs and salamanders evolved [MASK]rom dissorophoids . 
 Recently , the theory that t[MASK]mnospondyls wer[MASK] the ancestors of all lissamphibians has[MASK]gained wide support . The skull morphology of some small temno[MASK]pondyls has been compared to those[MASK]of modern frogs and [MASK]alamanders , but the presence of bicuspid , pedicellate teeth in small , paedomorphic or immature temnospondyls has be[MASK]n cited as the most convincing argumen[MASK] in favor of the temnospondyl origin of lissamphibian[MASK] . Seen in lissamphibians and many diss[MASK]rophoid temnospondyls , pedicella[MASK]e teeth have calcified tips and bases . During the de[MASK]elopment of most tetrapods , teeth begin to calcify at their tips . Calcification normally proceeds downward to the[MASK]base of the tooth , but calcification from the[MASK]tip stops abruptly in pedicellate teeth . Calcification resumes at the base , leaving an[MASK]a[MASK]ea in the center of the tooth uncalcified . This p[MASK]t[MASK]ern is seen in living amphibians and fossils . 
 The dissorophoid family [MASK]mphibamidae is thought to be most closel[MASK] relat[MASK]d to Lissamphibia . In 2008 , an amphibamid called Gerobatrac[MASK]us hott[MASK]ni was named [MASK]rom Texas and was nicknamed the " frogamander " for its frog @-@ like head and salamander @-@ like body . It was thought to be the most closely rel[MASK]ted temnospondyl to lissamphibians and was placed as the sister taxon of the group in a phylogenetic analysis . An[MASK]ther species of a[MASK]phibamid called Doleserpeton annectens is now thought to [MASK]e even more closely related to liss[MASK]mphibians . Unli[MASK]e Gerobatrachus , Doleserpeton w[MASK]s known since 1969 [MASK] and the presence of pedicellate teeth in its jaws has led some pal[MASK]ontologists to conclude soon after its naming that it wa[MASK] a relative[MASK]of modern amphibians . It was first described as a " protolissamphibian "[MASK], [MASK]nd the specific name annectens [MASK]eans " connecting " in reference to its inferred transitiona[MASK] position between[MASK]temnospondyls and lis[MASK]amphibians . The structure of its tympanum , a disk @-@ like membrane that funct[MASK]ons li[MASK]e an ear drum , is similar to that of[MASK]frogs and has also been used as evidence for a close relationship . Other[MASK]featu[MASK]es including [MASK]he shap[MASK] of t[MASK]e palate and the back of the skull , the short ribs , and the smooth skull surfa[MASK]e als[MASK] point to it being a cl[MASK]ser relative of lissamphibians than is Gerobatrachus . Below is a cladogram modified from Sigurdsen and Bolt ( 2010 ) showing the rel[MASK][MASK]ionships of Gerobatrachus , Do[MASK]eserpeton , and Lissamphibia :

 Although the earliest temnospondyls were primarily semiaquatic , they had the ability to feed on land . Later , eryopoids and dissorophoids , some well adapted to terrestrial life , also fed on land . So[MASK]e e[MASK]yopoi[MASK]s became better adapted towar[MASK] life in water , and shifted their diets toward aquatic organisms . The first pr[MASK]marily a[MASK]uatic[MASK]feed[MASK]rs were archegosaurs in the Permian . Trematosaurs and capitosaurs became in[MASK]ependently aquatic a[MASK]d also returned to this type of feeding . 
 Most aquatic stereospondyls have flattened heads . When feeding , they probably opened their mouths by lifting their skulls ins[MASK]ead of lowering their lower jaws . The jaw mechan[MASK]cs of the plagiosaurid Gerrothorax is [MASK]ell known , and is one of the most highly adapted . Gerrothorax is thought to have lifted its skull to around 50 ° above horizontal through the flexing of t[MASK]e atlanto @-@ occipital joint between the occipital condyles of the skull and the atlas vertebra of the neck . As the skull is raised , the qua[MASK]rate[MASK]bone pushes forward and causes the lower jaw to protrude[MASK]outward . Other stereospondyls probably also lifted their skulls , but they are not as well adapted for s[MASK]ch movement . D.M.S. Wats[MASK]n was the first[MASK]to suggest skull lifting as a means of feedin[MASK] in te[MASK]nospondyls . He envisioned that[MASK]Mastodonsaurus , a m[MASK]ch larger temnospondyl than Gerroth[MASK]rax , was able to make the same movement . Paleontol[MASK]gist A.L. Panchen also supported the idea in[MASK]1959 , suggesting that Batrachosuchus also fed in this way . At the time it was thought t[MASK]at these temnospondyls lifted their heads with stron[MASK] jaw muscles , but[MASK]it is now thought that they us[MASK]d [MASK]arger muscles in the neck th[MASK]t were attached to the large pectoral girdle . Plagiosuchus , a close relative of Gerrothorax , also has a hyobranchial[MASK]skeleton that muscles may have attached to . Plagiosuchus has very small teeth and a large area for muscle attachment behind the skull , suggesting that[MASK]it could suction feed by rapidly opening its mouth . 
 Unlike semiaquatic temn[MASK]s[MASK]ondyls , terrestrial temnospondyls have skulls that are adapted for biting land @-@ living prey . The sutures between the bones of the[MASK]skull in the dissorophoid Phonerpeton are able to withstand a high degree of compression . Compres[MASK]ive forces would have been experienced when bi[MASK]ing down on prey . Earlier aquatic tetrapods and t[MASK]trapod ancestors differ from temnospondyls like Phonerpeton in that their skulls [MASK]ere also built t[MASK] withstand tension . This tension would have been experienced during suction feeding underwater . Temnospondyls like [MASK]honerpeton were among the first tetrapods that were al[MASK]ost exclusively terrestrial and fed by biting . 
 
 = = = Reproduction = = = 
 
 Temnospondyls , li[MASK]e all amphibians , reproduced in aquatic environments . Most tem[MASK]ospondyls pr[MASK]b[MASK]bly reproduced through e[MASK]ternal fertilization . Like mo[MASK]t living frogs , female temnospondyls wo[MASK]ld [MASK]ave laid masses of eggs in water while males released sperm to fe[MASK]tilize them . Several fossils were described from the Early Permian of Texas in 1998 that may be egg masses of dissorophoid temnospondyls . They were the first known[MASK]fossils of amphibian eggs . The fossils cons[MASK]st of small disks with thin membranes that are probably vitelline membranes and halo @-@ like areas surrounding them that [MASK]re most [MASK]ikely mucous coatings . They are attached to plant fossils , suggesting that the[MASK]e temnospondyls laid eggs on aquatic [MASK]lants much like moder[MASK] frogs . The mucous membranes sho[MASK] that the eggs were laid by amphibians , not fish ( their eggs lack mucous ) , but the type of amphibian that laid them cannot be kno[MASK]n because no body fossils are preserved with the eg[MASK]s . The eggs are thought to be from dissorophoids because they are likely t[MASK] be close relatives of mode[MASK]n amphibians , and probably had sim[MASK]lar reproductive stra[MASK]egies . They are also the most common[MASK]amphibians from the deposit in which the [MASK]ggs were found . 
 One[MASK]temnospo[MASK]dyl , the dvinosaur Trimerorhachis , may have brooded young in an area between[MASK]the gills cal[MASK]ed the pharyngeal pouch . Small bones belonging to y[MASK]unger Trimerorhachis individuals have [MASK]ee[MASK] found in these pouches . The livin[MASK] Darwin 's Frog is also a[MASK]mouth brooder and would be the closest modern analogue to Trimerorhachis if it cared for its young in this way . An alternative possibility is that Trimerorhachis was cannibalistic ,[MASK]eating it[MASK] young like many amphibians do today . I[MASK] this was the case , the bones of these [MASK]maller individua[MASK]s[MASK]were originally located in the throat and [MASK]ere pushed into the pharyngeal p[MASK]uch as the animal fossilized [MASK] 
 Body impressions of E[MASK]rly Carboniferous temnospondyls from Pennsyl[MASK]ania sugg[MASK]st that some terrestrial temnospo[MASK]dyls mated on land like some modern amphibians . They reproduced through internal fertilization rather than mat[MASK]ng in water . The presence of three individuals in one block of sandstone shows that the temnospondyls were grega[MASK]ious . The head of one individual rests under the tail of another in what may be a courtship display . Internal fertilization and similar cour[MASK]ship behavio[MASK] are seen in modern salamanders . 
 
 = = = Growth = = = [MASK] 
 While most types of temnospondyls are distingui[MASK]hed on t[MASK]e basis of features in mature specimens , sever[MASK]l are known [MASK]rom juvenile and larval specimens . Metamorphosis is seen in dissorophoids , eryopids , an[MASK] z[MASK]trachydids , with aquat[MASK]c larvae developing into adults capable of living on land . Several types of dissorophoids[MASK]do not fully [MASK]etamorphose , but retain featur[MASK]s of juveniles such as gills and small body size in what is known as neoteny . D[MASK]inosaurians and the plagiosaurid Gerrothorax were a[MASK][MASK]o neotenic because they retai[MASK]ed gills , but the[MASK] are only known[MASK]from adult specimens . 
 Te[MASK]nospondyl larvae are often d[MASK]stinguished by poorly developed bones[MASK]and the presence of a hyobranchial apparatus , a s[MASK]ries of bones that gills would attach to in life . However , some fully mature temno[MASK]pondyls also possess hyobranchial bones but di[MASK] not have external gills . A dense covering [MASK]f scales is also seen in larvae and adults . Major body changes occu[MASK] in metamorphosis , including the reshaping and strengthening of skull bones , the thickening of postcranial bones , and an increase in body size . [MASK] Temnospondyls like Sclerocephalus are known from both large adult specimens and small larvae , showing an extreme change in body shape . In these species , the shape and proportions of skull bones change in the early stages[MASK]of development . The ornamentation on the surface of the skull roof[MASK]also d[MASK]velops at this time . Small , regularly spa[MASK]ed pits are the first to form , followed by larger ridges . As development continues , the external gills disappear . Small t[MASK]eth [MASK]hat once covered the palate are lost . The postcranial skeleton do[MASK]s not develop at the same rate as the skull , with ossification ( the replacement of cartilage by bone ) happening more slowly . Vertebrae and limb bones are poorly develop[MASK]d , ribs an[MASK] fingers are absent in the early stages , and the scapulocoracoid and ischium are entirely absent through most of development . Once matur[MASK]ty is reached , mos[MASK] bones have fully formed and growth rate slows . The bones of some temnospondyls like Dutuitos[MASK]urus show growth marks , possibly an ind[MASK]cation that growth rat[MASK] varied with the change in seasons . Fossils of temnospondyls like Metoposaurus and Che[MASK]ider[MASK]eton show that individual[MASK] grew larger pa[MASK]t maturity . The oldest individuals usually have more pittin[MASK] on their skulls with deeper sulci [MASK] 
 One group of temnospondyls , the Branchiosauridae[MASK], is also known from larval specimens . Branchio[MASK]a[MASK]rids l[MASK]ke Branchiosaurus and Apateon are represented by many fossils preserving skin and external gills . An ent[MASK]re growth[MASK]series is exhibited in [MASK]he w[MASK]de range of sizes among specimens , but the lack of[MASK]terrestrially adapted adult forms suggests that these temnospondyls were neo[MASK]enic . Unlike other tem[MASK]ospondyls , their postcranial skeletons developed quickly but were still partly cartilaginous when fully mature . Adults likely had a[MASK] aquatic lifestyle similar to juveniles . Rec[MASK][MASK]tly , large specimens of Apateon grac[MASK]lis were described with [MASK]daptations toward a terrestrial lifestyle , indicating that not all branchiosaurs were neotenic . 
 While most temnospondyls are aquatic in early stage[MASK] of life , m[MASK]st meto[MASK]osaurids appear to have been ter[MASK]estrial in their juvenil[MASK] stage . Like ot[MASK]er Mesozoic temnospondyls , adult metoposaurids were adapted to a semiaquatic lifestyle . Their bones are not highly developed for movement on land . The cross [MASK]-@ sectional thickness of limb bones in adult metoposau[MASK]ids shows that they could not withstand the stre[MASK]s of terrestrial locomotio[MASK] . Juvenile individuals have[MASK]bones tha[MASK] are thick enough to withstand this stress , a[MASK]d co[MASK]ld probably move about on land . To maintain a terrestrial lifestyle , a temnospondyl 's limb b[MASK]nes would have to thicken with positive allometry , m[MASK]aning that they would grow at a greater rate than the rest of the body . This is not the case in metoposaurids , meaning that as their bodies grew larger they became less adapted toward a terrestrial lifest[MASK]le [MASK] 
 
 = = = Hearing = = = 
 
 Temnospondyls and ot[MASK]er early tetrapods have rounded otic notches in the back of the skull that project into the che[MASK]k region . In life , the otic notch would have been covered by a mem[MASK]rane called th[MASK] tympanum , which is seen[MASK]as a disk @-@ like area[MASK]in living frog[MASK] . The tympanum [MASK]s involved in hearing , and [MASK]s similar to the ea[MASK] drum of more advanced tetrapods . It wa[MASK] t[MASK]aditionally thought that the tympanum deve[MASK]oped very early in tetrapod evolution as a hearing organ and progre[MASK]sed to form the ear drum of amniotes . Thus , temnospondyls possessed a hearing system supposedly ancestral to that of living amphibians and reptiles . 
 Frogs and all other living tetrap[MASK]ds have a rod @-@ like bone called the stapes that aids in hearing by transferring vibrations from the ear drum — or homologous tympanum — to the inner ear . Temnospo[MASK]d[MASK]ls also have a stapes , which projects into the otic cavity . The stape[MASK] likely evolved from the hyomandi[MASK]ula of lobe @-@ finned fishes . The positioning of the stapes and the shape of [MASK]he otic region suggests that the tympani of temnospondyl[MASK] and frogs are homologous , but the[MASK]tympani of these amphibians are no longer consider[MASK]d homologous with the hearing syste[MASK]s of reptiles , birds , and mammals . Therefore , ear structures in temnospondyls were not anc[MASK]stral to those of all other tetrapods . [MASK] The ability of the tympanum and stapes to effectively transmit vibrations is called im[MASK]edance matchin[MASK] . Early tetrapods like tem[MASK]ospo[MASK]dyls have thick stapes with poor impedance matching , so it is now thought that they were not used for hearing . Instead , these thick stapes may have functioned to support the tissue that covers the otic notch . Early temnospondyls li[MASK]e Dendrerpeton could not hear airborne sound but would have been able to detect vibration in the ground . Later temnospondyls like Doleserpeton had otic re[MASK][MASK]ons adapted to hearing . Dolese[MASK]peton has a structure in the inner ear called the pe[MASK]ilymphatic du[MASK]t , which is also [MASK]ee[MASK] in[MASK]frogs and is associated with hearing . Its stapes is also a better transmitter[MASK]of sound . The hearing system of Doleserpe[MASK]on and related temnospondyls was able to detect airborne sound and may have been[MASK]ancestr[MASK]l to that of living amphibians .

 = Osbert de Bayeux = 
 
 Osbert de B[MASK]yeux ( floruit 1121 to 1184 ) was a medieval E[MASK]glish cleric and archdeacon in the Diocese of York . A relative of Thurstan , the Archb[MASK]shop of[MASK]York , Osbert probably owed his ecclesiastical positions to this relative . After Thurstan 's death , Osbert was opposed to one of[MASK]the candidates for the archbishopric , William fitzHerbert [MASK] and worked to secure fitzHerbert 's deposition a[MASK]d replacement by[MASK]Henry Murdac . After Murdac 's death in 1153 , Osbert tried to pre[MASK]ent the return of fitzHerbert , but these attempts were u[MASK]successful . When fitzHerbert died suddenly in 1154 , Osbert was accused of murdering the newly returned archbishop . Although he was nev[MASK]r convicted of the murd[MASK]r in either a secular or an ecclesiastical court , he was stripped of his clerical status and be[MASK]ame a layman before [MASK]158 . He died after 1184 , perhaps even after 1194 . [MASK]

 Osbert was first mentioned in the hi[MASK]torical record between 1121 and 1128 when he appears in a charter , which althou[MASK]h likely a forgery , probably contains an authentic witness list . This document lists him as " Os[MASK]ert archdeacon " , which means that he pr[MASK]bably held the archdeaconry of Richmond . He wa[MASK] the nephew of [MASK]hurstan , who was Archbishop of York from 11[MASK]4 to 1140[MASK]. Presumably he owed his position as archdeacon to his uncle and was pro[MASK]ably appointed at a you[MASK]g age .

 Osbert was opposed to the election of Willi[MASK]m fitzHerbert as Archbishop of York and s[MASK]pported William 's rival and successor [MASK]enry Murdac . Although he remai[MASK]ed a supporter of Murdac after 1147 , he did oppose [MASK]urda[MASK] 's interventions in Selby Abbey , where Murdac had deposed one abbot and appo[MASK]nted another . In 1153 , Osbert deposed Murdac 's choice as abbot of Selby and appointed another abbot . Originally , Osbert h[MASK]d supported Elias Paynel , Murdac 's choice for abbot , [MASK][MASK]t then changed his stance and helped with the dep[MASK]sition . 
 After M[MASK]rdac 's death in 1153 , Osbert was opposed to William 's return as archbishop , but was unsuccessful in his attempts to prevent William 's reappointment . Wil[MASK]iam died a week after his r[MASK]turn to York , however[MASK], and Osbert , alon[MASK] with Robert of Ghent , the Dean of York [MASK] secured the [MASK]uick election of the new archbishop , Roger de Pont L 'Évêque .

 Osbert was accused of murdering William , specifically by poisoning him through the com[MASK]union cha[MASK]ice . A fellow cleric , Symphorian ,[MASK]who had[MASK]been a chaplain of the deceased archbishop , bro[MASK]ght murder charges against Osbert . Sympho[MASK]ian obtained a hearing on the charges at [MASK] royal council presided over by King Stephen of England at Michae[MASK]mas in 1154 , b[MASK]t Stephen 's subseq[MASK]ent death prevented a resol[MASK]tion . Osbert attempted to have the trial switche[MASK] to an ecclesiastical court [MASK]nd was supported in his ef[MASK]orts by Arch[MASK]ish[MASK]p Theobald of Canterbury . A trial was finally [MASK]eld in 1156 and Osbert 's accuser did not produce any witnesses , but Osbert was unable to prove his innocence , prompting the transf[MASK]r of the case to a papal[MASK]court . No[MASK]record of any judgment exists[MASK], but Osbert apparently appeared before two popes , [MASK]drian IV and Alexand[MASK]r III . A furt[MASK]er ap[MASK]eal to the papal court was referred to papal judges @-@ delegate between 1175 and 1[MASK]80 . 
 The case attracted commentary by two contemporary writers . Jo[MASK]n of Salisbury , who was a secretary for Theobald , added i[MASK]formation about Osbert in a letter to Alexander III o[MASK] unrelated business . In the section of the letter , John pointed out to the pope[MASK]that no matter what others might say about Osbert[MASK], he had failed to secure othe[MASK] c[MASK]ergy willing to swear that he w[MASK]s innocent . Another contemporary , Gilbert Foliot , who was Bishop of Hereford , wrote to the pope to remind him that although Osbert 's accuser had offered to prove his accusatio[MASK]s by undergoing a trial by ordeal , this was essen[MASK]ially meaningless since c[MASK]non law forbade the clergy from the ordeal .

 = Dvorak technique = 
 
 The D[MASK]orak technique ( developed between 1969 and 1984 by Vernon Dvorak ) is a widely use[MASK] system to estimate tropical cyclone intensity [MASK] which[MASK]includes tropical depression , tropical storm , and hurricane / typhoon / intense tropical cyclone intensities[MASK]) based sole[MASK]y on visible and infrared satellite images . Within the Dvorak [MASK]atellite strengt[MASK] e[MASK]timate for tropical cyclones , there [MASK]re several visual patterns that a cyclone may take [MASK]n which[MASK]define the upper and lower bounds on its intensity . The primary patterns u[MASK]ed are curved band pattern ( T1.0 @-@ T4.[MASK] ) , shear pattern ( T1.5 @-@ T3.5 ) , [MASK]entral dense overcast ( CDO ) pattern ( T2.5 @-@ T5.0 ) , central cold cover ( CCC ) pattern , banding eye pattern ( T4.0 @-@ T4.5 ) , and eye pattern ( T4.5 - T8.[MASK] ) . 
 Both the central den[MASK]e overcast and embedded eye pattern use the[MASK]size of the CDO . The CDO pattern intensities start at T2.5 , equivalent to m[MASK]nima[MASK] tropical storm int[MASK]nsity ( 40 mph , 65 km / h ) . The shape[MASK]of the central de[MASK]se overcast is also considered . The eye pattern utilizes the coldness of the cloud tops within the surrounding[MASK]mass of thunderstorms a[MASK]d contrasts it with the temperature within the eye itself . The larger the t[MASK]mperature difference is , the stronger the tropical cyclon[MASK][MASK]. Once a patt[MASK]rn is[MASK]identified , the storm features ( such as length and curvature of banding features ) are further analyzed to arrive at a particular T @-@ number . The CCC p[MASK]ttern indicates litt[MASK]e development is occurring , despite the cold c[MASK]oud top[MASK] associated with the quickly evolving feature . 
 Several agencies issue Dvorak intensity[MASK]numbers for tropical [MASK]yclones and their precursors , including the National Hurricane Ce[MASK]ter 's Tropical Analysis and Forecast Branch ( TAFB ) , the NOAA / NESDIS Satellite Analysis Branch ( SAB ) , and the Joint Typhoon[MASK]Warning Center at the Na[MASK]al Meteorology and Oceanography Command in P[MASK]arl Harbor ,[MASK]Hawaii . 
 
 = = Evolution [MASK]f the method = = 
 
 The[MASK]initial development of this technique occurred in 1969 by Vernon Dvorak , using satellite pictures of tropical c[MASK]clones within the northwest Pacific ocean . The sys[MASK]e[MASK] as [MASK]t was initially conceived involved pattern matching of cloud features with a development and decay [MASK]odel . As the technique matured through the 1970s an[MASK] 1980s , measurement of clou[MASK] fea[MASK]ures became dominant in defining tropical cyclone intensity and central pressure of the tropical cyclone 's low @-@ pressure area . Use of i[MASK]frared satellite imagery led to a more objective assessment of the strength of tropical cyclones with e[MASK]es , using the cloud top temperatures within the eyewall and contrasting them with the warm temp[MASK]ratures within the eye itself . Constraints on short term intensity change are used less frequently than they were [MASK]ack in the 1970s and 1980s . The central pressures assigned to tropical cyclones have r[MASK]quir[MASK]d modification , as the original estimates were 5 @-@ 10 hP[MASK] ( 0 @.@ 15 @-@ 0 @.@ 29 inHg ) too low in the Atlantic and up to 20[MASK]hPa [MASK] 0 @.@ 59 inHg ) too high in the northwe[MASK]t Pacific . This led to the development of a separate wind @-@ pressure relationship for the northwest Pacific , devised by Atkinso[MASK] and Holliday in 1975 , then modified in 1977 . 
 As human [MASK]nalysts using the t[MASK]chnique lead to subje[MASK]ti[MASK]e biases , efforts have been made to make more objective estimates using computer prog[MASK]ams , which have been aided by higher @-@ resolution satellite imagery and more powerfu[MASK] compute[MASK]s . Since tropical cyclone satellite [MASK]atter[MASK]s can fluctuate ov[MASK]r time , auto[MASK]ated techni[MASK]ues use a six @-@ hour averaging period to lea[MASK] to more reliable intensity estimates . Development of the objective [MASK]vorak technique began in 1998 , which perf[MASK]rmed best with tropical cyclones that had eyes ( of hurricane or typhoon strength )[MASK]. I[MASK] still required a manual center placement , keeping some subjectivity within the process . By [MASK]004 , an advanced objective Dvorak technique was developed which utilized banding features for systems below hurricane intensity and to objectively de[MASK]ermine the tropical cyclone 's center . A central pressure bias was uncovered in 2004 relating to th[MASK] slope of the tropopause and cloud top temperatures which change with latitude that[MASK]helped[MASK]improve central pressure estimates within the objective technique . 
 
 = = Details of the method = = 
 
 In a developing cyclone , the technique takes advantage of the fact that cyclones of similar intensity tend to have certain characterist[MASK]c features , a[MASK]d as they[MASK]strengthen , they tend to [MASK]hange in appearance in a predictable manner . The str[MASK]cture and or[MASK]anizatio[MASK] of the tr[MASK]pical cyclone are tracked over 24 hours to determine if t[MASK]e storm has weakened , maintained its intensity , or strengthened . Various centra[MASK] cloud and banding features are compared[MASK]with templat[MASK]s tha[MASK] [MASK]how ty[MASK]ical storm patterns a[MASK]d their associ[MASK]ted int[MASK]nsity . If infrared satel[MASK]ite imagery is available fo[MASK] a cyclone with a visible eye pattern , then the technique utilizes the difference between the temperature of the warm eye and the surrounding cold cloud tops to determine intensity ( colder cloud tops generally indicate a more intense storm ) . In each ca[MASK]e a " T @-@ number " ( an abbreviation for Tropical Number )[MASK]and a Current Intensi[MASK]y ( CI ) value ar[MASK] assigned to the[MASK]storm . These measurements range between 1 ( minimum intensity [MASK] and 8 ( maximum intensity ) . The T @-[MASK] number and CI value ar[MASK] the same except for weakening storms , in which case the CI is higher . For we[MASK]kening systems , [MASK]he CI is held as the tropical cyclone intensit[MASK] for 12 hours , though research from the National Hurricane Center indicates that six hours is more reasonabl[MASK] . The table [MASK]t right shows the approximate surface wind speed and sea level pressure that corresponds to a given T @-@[MASK]number .

 = = = Pattern types = =[MASK]= 
 
 Wit[MASK]in the Dvorak satell[MASK]te [MASK]trength estimate for tropical cyclon[MASK]s , there are several visual patterns that a cyclone may take on which define the upper and lower bounds on its intensity . The pri[MASK]ary patterns used are curved band pattern ( T1.0 @-@ T4.5 ) , she[MASK]r pattern ( T1.5 @-@ T3.5 ) , central dense overcast ( CDO ) pattern ( T2.5 @-@ T5.0 ) , banding eye pattern ( T4.0 @-@ T4.5 ) , eye pattern ( T4.5 - T8.0 ) , and c[MASK]n[MASK]ral cold cover ( CCC ) pattern . Both the central dense overcast and embedded e[MASK]e pattern utilize the [MASK]ize of the CDO . The CDO pattern inten[MASK]ities sta[MASK]t at T2.5 , equivalent to minimal tropical[MASK]storm intensity ( 40 miles [MASK]er hour ( 64 km / h ) ) . The shape of the central dense overcast is also considered . The farther the center is tucked into the CDO , the stronger it is deemed . Tropical cyclones wit[MASK] maximum sustained winds between 65 miles per hour ( 105 km / h ) and 100 miles per hour ( 160 km / h ) can hav[MASK] their center of circ[MASK]lations obscured by[MASK][MASK]loudiness within visible and infrared satellite imagery , which makes diagnosis of their intensity a challenge . 
 The CCC pattern , with its larg[MASK] and quickly developing mass of thick cirrus clouds spreading out from an are[MASK] of convection near a tr[MASK][MASK]ical cyclone center within a[MASK]short time frame , indicates little development . When it develops , rainbands and cloud lines [MASK]round the tropical cyclone weaken and the thick cloud shield obscures the circulation center . While it resem[MASK]les a CDO pattern , it is rarely seen . 
 The eye pattern utilizes the coldness of the cloud tops within the surrounding mass of thunderstorms and contrasts it with the temperature[MASK]within the eye itself . The la[MASK]ger the temperature di[MASK]ference is , the stronger the tropical cyclone . Winds within[MASK]tropical cyclones can also be esti[MASK][MASK]ted b[MASK] t[MASK]acking fe[MASK]tures within the CDO using rapid scan geostationary satellite imagery , whose [MASK]ictures are taken minutes apart rather than every half @-@ hour . [MASK] Once a pattern is identified , the storm features ( such [MASK]s le[MASK]gth and curvature of banding features ) are further analyzed to arrive at a particular T @-@ number .

 Note that in this case the [MASK]vorak T @-@ number ( in this case T2.5 )[MASK]was simply u[MASK]ed as a guide b[MASK]t [MASK]ther factors determined how the NHC decided to set th[MASK] system 's intensity . 
 The Cooperative Ins[MASK]itute for Meteorological Satelli[MASK]e Studies ( CIMSS ) at the University of Wisconsin – Madison has developed the Objective Dvorak Technique ( ODT ) . This is a modified[MASK]versio[MASK] of the Dvorak technique which uses computer algorithms rather than subjective human interpretation to arrive at a CI number . This is generally not implemented for tropical depressions or weak tro[MASK]ical sto[MASK]ms . The[MASK]China Meteorological Agency ( CMA ) is expected to start using the standard 1984 version of Dvorak in the near future . The Ind[MASK]an Meteorological Depart[MASK]ent ( IMD ) prefers using visible satellite image[MASK]y over i[MASK]frared imagery due to a perceived high bias in estimates derived from infrared imagery during the early morning hours of convective maximum . The Japan Meteorological Agency ( JMA ) uses the infrared version of Dvorak over the visible imagery v[MASK]rsion . Hong Kong Observatory and JMA continue to utilize Dvorak after tropical cyclone landfall . Various ce[MASK]ters hold on to the maximum current intensity for 6 – 12 hours , though this rule is broken when rapid weakening is obvious .

 The most sign[MASK]ficant benefit of the use of the technique is that it has provided a more complete history of tropical cyclone i[MASK]tensity in areas where aircraft reconnais[MASK]ance is neither possible nor routinely[MASK]available . Intensity estimates of maximum sustaine[MASK] wind are currently w[MASK]thi[MASK] 5 miles[MASK]per hour ( 8 @.[MASK] 0 km / h ) of what aircraft are [MASK]ble to measure half of the time , th[MASK]ugh the assignment of intensity of systems with streng[MASK]hs between moderate tropical @-@ storm[MASK]force ( 60 miles per hour ( 97 km / h ) ) and weak hurricane- or typhoon @-@ force ( 100 miles per hour ( 160 km / h ) ) is the least certain . Its overall precision has not always been true , as refinements in the technique led to intensity changes between 1972 and 1977 of up to 20 miles pe[MASK] hour ( 32 km / h ) . The method is internally consis[MASK]ent in that it constrains rapid increases or decreases in tropical cyclone intensity . Some tropical cyclones fluctuate in strength more than the 2 @.@ 5 T numbers per day limit allowed[MASK]by the rule , which can work to the technique 's disadvantage and has led to occasional abandonment of the constr[MASK]ints since the 1980s . Systems with small eyes near the[MASK][MASK]imb , or edge , of a satellite ima[MASK]e can be biased too weakly using the technique ,[MASK]which can be resolved through use of polar[MASK]@-@ orbiting satellite imagery . Subtropic[MASK]l cyclone in[MASK]ensity cannot be determined using Dvorak , which led to the dev[MASK]lopment of the Hebert @-@ Poteat techniqu[MASK] in 1975 . Cyclones undergoing extratropical transition , losing their thunderstorm activity , see their intensities underestimated using the Dvorak technique . This led to the d[MASK]velopment of the Mil[MASK]er and Lander extratropical transition technique which ca[MASK] be used under these circumstances .

A left @-@ handed starting pitcher , Kershaw has played in the major leagues sinc[MASK] 2008 , and his career earned run average ( ERA ) and Walks and hits per innings pitched average ( WHIP ) ar[MASK] the lowest among starters in the live @-@ ball[MASK]era with[MASK]a minimum of 1 @,@ 000 innings pitched . With his Career Hi[MASK]s Allow[MASK]d Pe[MASK] Nine Innings Pitched average ( 6 @.@ 64 ) Which is the second lowest in MLB Hi[MASK]tory , a three @-@ time Cy Young Award winner , the 2014 National League Most Valuable Player and Los Ang[MASK]les Dodgers All Time Leader in walks and hits per innings pitched[MASK]( 1 @.@ 01 ) and hits allowed per nine [MASK]nnings pitched ( 6 @.@ 64 ) , Kersha[MASK] is considered by many to [MASK]e the best pitcher in MLB . 
 Kershaw was drafted seventh overall in the 2006 MLB draft . He worked his way through the Dodgers ' farm system in just one full season , and reached the majors at 20 years old . When he debu[MASK]ed in 2008 , he was[MASK]the youngest player in MLB , a title he held for one full y[MASK]ar . [MASK]n 2011 , he won the pitching Triple [MASK]rown and the National League Cy Young Award , becoming the youngest pitcher to accomplish either of these feats since Dwight Goode[MASK] in 1985 . Kershaw pitched a no @-@ hitter on June 18 , 2014 ,[MASK]becoming the 22nd Dodger to do so . Being a left @-@ handed strikeout pitc[MASK]er and pla[MASK]ing for the[MASK][MASK]os Angeles Dodgers , Kershaw has ofte[MASK] been compared to Hall of Fame pitcher Sandy Ko[MASK]fax .

 On April 15 , 2009 , Kershaw pitched seven innings , striking o[MASK]t 13 batters while allowing only one hit ( a solo home run ) against the rival San Francisco Giants . He was the y[MASK]ungest Dodger to ever strikeout 13 or more batters [MASK]n a game since Sandy Koufax d[MASK]d it in the 1955 s[MASK]ason . On May 17 , 2009 , Kershaw did not allow a hit against the Florida Marlins through 7 innings , then gave up a lea[MASK] @-@ o[MASK]f double to Florida 's Cody Ross .

Just[MASK]n Verlander of the Detr[MASK]it Tigers won the American League Triple Crown the same season , marking the first major @-@ league season since 1924 to feature Triple Crown @-@ winning pitchers in both leagues . Kershaw 's 21 wins were the most by a Dodger pitcher since Orel Hershiser won 23 during the 1988 season . His ERA was the lowe[MASK]t by a Dodger since Hershiser 's 2 @.@[MASK]03 in the 1985 season , his strikeouts w[MASK]re the most by a Dodg[MASK]r since Koufax 's 317 in 1966 [MASK]nd his 233 1 ⁄ 3 innings pitched were the most since Chan Ho Park pitched 234 in 2001 .

In that opening day start he pitched a complete game , four hit , shutout over the Giants and also hit his first career hom[MASK] run . He was the f[MASK]rst pitcher to thro[MASK] a shu[MASK]out and[MASK]hit a home run on opening day since Bob Le[MASK][MASK]n of the Cleveland Indians did so against the Chicago Wh[MASK]te Sox on April 14 , 1953 .

 Kershaw 's pitching[MASK]style relies on deception . He keeps the ball hidd[MASK]n so t[MASK]at it is hard for the batter to pick up the ball and has a consistent [MASK]verhand delivery on all of his pitches . Out of the w[MASK]ndup , Kershaw lower[MASK] his right foot vertically with a slight pause before moving it fo[MASK]ward to[MASK]ard the plate . The motion [MASK]as described during the 2015 National League Division Series as a " kickstand move [MASK] drawing comparison with one setting a kickstand[MASK]on a bicycle .

 Kershaw 's repertoire inc[MASK]udes a four @-@ seam fastball that sits anywhere from 92 miles pe[MASK] hour ( 148 km /[MASK]h ) to 95 miles per hour ( 153 km / h ) and tops out at 98 miles per hour ( 158 km / h ) with late movement , a slider at 84 miles [MASK]er hour ( 135 km / h ) – 87 miles per hour ( 140 km / h ) , a 12 – 6 curveball between 72 miles per hour ( 116 km / h ) –[MASK]76 miles per hour ( 122 km / h ) , and a[MASK]seldom th[MASK]own [MASK]hangeup ( under 3 % ) . As of late in the 2015 season , he is believed to be experimenting with the use of a cu[MASK]ter .

 Josepha Petrick Kemarre is an Anmatyerre @-@ speaking Indigenous Australian , born a[MASK]ound 1945 or 19[MASK]3 at the Santa Tere[MASK]a Mission , near Alice Springs in Australia [MASK]s Northern Territory . 
 When Josepha Petrick began painting for Mbantua Gallery[MASK]in central Australia ,[MASK]she indicated that her name was Josepha rather than Josie , and that this was how s[MASK]e henceforth wished to be known ; however Mbantua 's biography is the only source that has use[MASK] that version of her name . 
 After marrying Robin Petyarre , brother of artist Gloria Petyarre , Josepha Petrick moved to the region of Ut[MASK]pia , north @-@ east of Alice Springs , which is where she was[MASK]livi[MASK]g when she began painting around 1990[MASK]. [MASK]hey had seven chil[MASK]ren , one of whom , Damien Petrick , went on to become an arti[MASK]t like h[MASK]s mo[MASK]her . By 2008 , Josie Petrick 's husband had died , and Petrick was dividing he[MASK] time between Alice Springs and Harts Range , to its no[MASK]th [MASK]-@ east .

 Contemporary Indigenous art of the we[MASK]tern desert [MASK]egan in 1971 when Indigenous men at Papunya created murals and canvases using west[MASK]rn art materials , assisted by teacher Geoffrey [MASK]ardon . Their work , which used acrylic paints to create designs representing body painting and ground sculptures , rapidly spread acros[MASK] Indigenous communi[MASK]ies of central Aust[MASK]alia , particularly after the introducti[MASK]n of a gover[MASK]ment @-@ sanction[MASK]d art pr[MASK]gram in centra[MASK] Australia in 1983 . By the 1980s and ' 90s , such work was being ex[MASK]ibited internationally . The first artists , including all of the founders of the Papunya Tula artists ' com[MASK]any , were men , and there was resistance among the [MASK]intupi men of central Australia to women also[MASK]painting . However , many of the women wished to participate , and in the 1990s many of them began t[MASK] paint . In the western desert communities such as U[MASK]opia , Kintore , Yuendumu , Balgo , and on the outstations , people wer[MASK] beginning to create a[MASK]t works expressly for exhibition and sale .

 Josepha Petrick be[MASK]an painting about 1990 or 1992 as part of the contemporary Indigenous art moveme[MASK]t th[MASK]t had begun at Papunya in the 1970s . By 1998 her work was being collected by both private [MASK]nd public institutions , such as Charles Sturt University , a[MASK]d in 2005 a work was purchased by the National Galle[MASK]y of Victoria . Her career received a significant boost when her work [MASK]as included in the National Gallery of Victoria 's 2006 Landmarks[MASK]exhibition and its catalogue ; her painting was printed opposite that of Yannima Tommy[MASK]Watson , who was by this time [MASK]amous , particular[MASK]y for his cont[MASK]ibution to the design of a new building for [MASK]he Musée du quai Branly . Petrick 's painting[MASK] have been included[MASK]at exhibitions in several private galleries in Melbourne and Hong Kong , as well as at the Australian embassy in Washington in 2001 . [MASK] In 2006 a commiss[MASK]oned work by Petrick was exhibited at Shalom College at the University of New South Wales [MASK]s part of a charity fundraising exhibition . It sold for A $ 22 @,@ 000 . As of the end of 2008 , the hi[MASK][MASK]est recorded auction price for an item of Petrick 's work was $ 22 @,@ 800 [MASK] set in May 2007 . An [MASK]mage [MASK]ased on a triptych by Petrick , Bush Berries , appears on the cover[MASK]of a boo[MASK] on [MASK]he visual perception of motion , Motion Vision . 
 Central Australian artists frequently paint particular " dream[MASK]ngs "[MASK], o[MASK] stories , for which [MASK]hey have responsibility or rights . These stories are used to pass " importa[MASK]t knowledge , cultural values and belief[MASK]systems[MASK]" from generati[MASK]n to generation . Paintings by Petrick portray two [MASK]ifferent groups of dreamings , rendered in two distinct styles . Bush p[MASK]um dreaming represents a plant of the central Australian desert which is " a source of physica[MASK] and spiritual sustenance , reminding [ the local Indigenou[MASK] people ] of the sacr[MASK]dness of[MASK][ their ] country " . These paintings are undertaken with red , blue and orange dots that represent the fruit at diffe[MASK]ent stages in its development . She also paints women ’ s ceremonies ( Awelye ) and dreamings , and these are created using rows of coloured dots and include representations of women [MASK]s ceremonial iconography . 
 Journalist Zeld[MASK] Cawthorne described Petrick as one of the " finest contemporary Aboriginal artists " . Art consultant Adrian Newstead has ranked her as amongst [MASK]he country 's top 200 Indig[MASK]nous artists [MASK][MASK]noting that she has be[MASK]ome " known for i[MASK]novative wo[MASK]ks that create a sense of visual harmony through fine [MASK]ariegated fields of immaculately applied dotting " . Her style is described by Indigenous art writers Birnberg and Kreczmanski as an " interesting , modern interpretation of landsca[MASK]e " . 
 Petrick 's work is held in a v[MASK]riety [MASK]f pu[MASK]lic and private collections , including Artbank , the Cha[MASK]les Sturt University Collection , the Holmes a Court Collection , and the National Gallery of Victoria . 
 
 
 = [MASK]ead VI = 
 
 [MASK]ead VI is an oil @-@ on @-@ canvas painting by the Irish @-[MASK] born English figurative artist Francis Bacon , the last of si[MASK] pan[MASK]ls making up his " 1949 Head " series . It shows a bust view of[MASK]a sing[MASK]e figure , modeled on Diego Velázquez 's Portrait[MASK]of Innocent X. Baco[MASK] applies forceful , expressive brush strokes , and places the figure within a glass cage structure , behind curtain @-@ l[MASK]ke drapery . This gi[MASK]es the effect of a [MASK]an trapped and suffocated by his surroun[MASK]ings , screaming into an airless void . 
 Head VI was the first of Bacon 's paintings to reference Velázquez , whose portrai[MASK] of Pope Innocent X haunted him throughout his career and inspired his series of " screaming popes " , a loose[MASK]series of which there are[MASK]around 45 surviving individual works . Head VI contains many motifs that were to[MASK]reappear i[MASK] Bacon 's work . The hanging object , which may be a light switch[MASK]or curtain tassel , can be found even in his late paintings . T[MASK]e geometric cage is a motif that appears as late as his 1985 – 86 masterpie[MASK]e , Study for a Self[MASK]@-@ Portrait — Triptych . 
 Head VI was first exhibited in November 19[MASK]9 at the Hanover Galle[MASK]y in London , in a showing organis[MASK]d by one of the artist 's early champions , Erica Brausen . At the time , Bacon was a highly controversial but respected artist , best known for[MASK]his 1944 Three Studies for [MASK]i[MASK]ures at the Base of a Cruc[MASK]fixion , which made him the enfant terrible of Briti[MASK]h art . Head VI drew a mixed reaction from art critics ; John Russell , later Bacon 's biographer , at the time dismissed it as a cross between " an alli[MASK]ator shorn [MASK]f its jaws and an accountant in pince @-@ nez who has come to a bad end " . In 1989 Lawrence Gowing wrote that the " shock of the pictu[MASK]e , when it was se[MASK]n with a whole series of heads ... was indescribable . It was everything unpardonable . The paradoxical appearance at once of [MASK]astiche and iconoclasm was indeed one of Bacon 's mos[MASK] original strokes . " Art crit[MASK]c and curator Davi[MASK] Sylvester described it as a seminal piece from Bacon 's unusually productive 1949 – 50 period , and one of Bacon 's fine[MASK]t popes . 
 
 = = 1949 Head series = = 
 
 Bacon 's output is characterised by sequences[MASK]of imag[MASK]s . He told Sylvester[MASK]that h[MASK]s imagination was stimulated by sequences and that " images breed other i[MASK]a[MASK]es in me " . His series were not [MASK]lways planned or painted in sequence ; sometimes paintings are grouped for convenience but vary in ex[MASK]cution and tone . The idea for the head series came after he return[MASK]d penniless , late in 1[MASK]48 , from a stay in Tangier . In the previous three years he ha[MASK] been unable to find a voice ; the last surviving canvas from this period is[MASK]his Painting ( 19[MASK]6 ) . Although he continued to[MASK]paint , h[MASK] was a ruthless self critic [MASK] given to slashing canvases with bl[MASK]des , and no works survive from between 1947 and the winter of 1948 . Gallerist Erica Brausen offered Bacon the opport[MASK]nity of a solo show for t[MASK][MASK] opening o[MASK] her new Ha[MASK]over Gallery . He agreed , but had nothing in reserve to hang . I[MASK] following year[MASK] , Brausen became perhaps the most important of Bacon 's early champions ; she arranged this showing —[MASK]his debut solo exhibition — publicised him wid[MASK]ly and [MASK]rganis[MASK]d viewings for i[MASK]ternational buyers . 
 Al[MASK]eady 40 years old , Baco[MASK] viewed the e[MASK]hibition as his l[MASK]st chance and applied himself to the task with determination . Because he had destroyed all his out of the last t[MASK]ree year[MASK] , he had little choice but to present new works . He did not have a grand plan when he agreed t[MASK] the show , but eventually found themes that interested him in his Head[MASK]I of the p[MASK]evious year , an[MASK] executed five progressively stronger variants in the final weeks before the November exhi[MASK]ition , completing the [MASK]eries barely in time for the opening [MASK] 
 The paintings depict isolated figures enclosed in spaces th[MASK]t are undefined , overwhelmingly claustrophobic , reductive and eerie . Coming early in Bacon 's career , they are uneven in quality , but show a clear progression especially in how they utilise and present ideas he was still clearly developing and coming to terms with . Head I ( [MASK]ctually begun in the winter of 1948 ) and Head II show formless pieces of flesh that broadly resemble human heads ; they have half @-@ open eyes and a pharynx , though it is positioned much higher than would be expected in a human . Heads III , IV and[MASK]V show fully formed busts recognisable as men , and a[MASK]e characterised by a haunted atmosphere . These two broad ideas coalesce in Head VI , which is as physiologically [MASK]ortured as the first t[MASK]o p[MASK]intings , and as spect[MASK]al as t[MASK]e middle three . In Head VI the figur[MASK] has developed and is now shown wearing vestments[MASK], the first indication in Bacon 's work of the influence of Velá[MASK]quez ,[MASK]while the[MASK]focus has become the open mouth and the study of the human screa[MASK] . 
 Bacon sai[MASK] that chance played a significant[MASK]role in his work ,[MASK]and that he[MASK]often approached a canvas without havi[MASK]g a clear idea of what might emerge . This was especially the case in the mid to late 1940s , a p[MASK]riod when h[MASK] was drinking heavily and spending most nights in Soho casinos and poker rooms . The following morning he would often[MASK]approach his canvas " in a bad mood of drinking ... under tremendous hangovers and drink ; I sometimes hardly knew what [MASK] wa[MASK] doing . " He incorporated his appetite fo[MASK] cha[MASK]ce into his work : an image often would [MASK]orph mid @-@ way through into something quite different from what he had first intended . He actively sought out this freedom [MASK]nd felt it crucial to his progression as an artist . To him , lifestyle and art were intertwined ; he said that " perhaps the drink helped me to be a bit freer . " This i[MASK] very evident in the 1949 series , which began as a rather morb[MASK]d study of a c[MASK]llapsed hea[MASK] , but evolved over the[MASK]six surviv[MASK]ng p[MASK]nels into a[MASK]rewo[MASK]king of Velázquez masterpieces , and arrived at an image that was to preoccupy Bacon for the subsequent 20 years . 
 The series mark[MASK] Bacon 's fir[MASK]t attempt a[MASK] depicting lone figures in rooms . For him , the key aspect was that it appeared tha[MASK] the subject felt isolated , unobserved , and had ab[MASK]ndoned the need[MASK]to present an outward face[MASK]. He beli[MASK]ved that under these circumstances all pretence falls away , and the social being becom[MASK]s the sum of its neuroses , which Bacon attempted to convey by red[MASK]cing the subject t[MASK] its bare [MASK]-@ bones features : a mouth , ears , eyes , a jaw . Accordi[MASK]g to Russell , " the view out front ceases to be the only one ,[MASK]and our person is suddenly adrif[MASK] , fragmented , and subject to strange mutation . " Russell observed that while the depiction of figures in rooms is common[MASK]through all eras of painting , the figures are always posed , and usually seemingly aware that they are being [MASK]ortrayed . This conceit is abandoned in Bacon 's series . 
 Head I , completed la[MASK]e in 1948 , is consider[MASK]d more successful than Head II . Although it is w[MASK]ll @-@ regarded critically , Head II [MASK]s seen as something of a creative cul @-@ d[MASK] @-@ sac , while Heads III , IV and V are usually considered[MASK]as merel[MASK] intermediate steps towa[MASK]ds Head V[MASK] . It is exceptional in[MASK]Bacon 's oeuvre th[MASK]t works of their relative poor quality survive ; he was ruthlessly self @-@ critical and often slashed or abandoned canvasses before they were completed . When pressed [MASK]gain by Brausen i[MASK] 1953 to produce works for a [MASK]ew York show that she had been publicising for a year , he was full of doubt and destroyed most of what he had been working on , [MASK]ncluding several other popes . 
 Brau[MASK]en commissioned another s[MASK]owing[MASK]to be held in 1950 , for which Bacon pain[MASK]ed three large popes modelled on Velázquez 's portrait . The gallery advertised the show [MASK]s " Fra[MASK]cis Bacon : Three Studies from the Painting of Innocent X by Velázquez " , but in t[MASK]e end Bacon was dissatisfied with the[MASK]works and [MASK]estroyed them before the show opened . 
 
 = = Descripti[MASK]n = = 
 
 The[MASK]figure is clearly identifiable as a pope from his clothing . It see[MASK]s trapped and isolated within the outlines of a[MASK] abstract thre[MASK] @-@ dim[MASK]nsional glass cage . This fram[MASK]ng device , [MASK]escr[MASK]bed by Sylvester a[MASK] a " space @-@ frame " , was to[MASK]feature heavily throughout the artist 's career . A cord hangs from the upper edge of the glass case , falling just in front of the pope 's face and partially covering his eyes . It is too indistinctly drawn to identify with certainty , but giv[MASK]n the presence of similar objects in Bacon 's later w[MASK]rks , may be either the[MASK]end of a hanging light switch or the tassel of a curtain ; the hanging cord was to become a signature for the artist . Apart from its symbolic meaning , it has a compositional func[MASK]ion , framing the painting with a further set of vertical lines . Such an object reappears most prominently in the centre panel of[MASK]his 1973 Triptych , May – June 1973 , where it is cl[MASK]arly a dangling li[MASK]ht bulb . For Bacon , these elements were intended to make the figure waver in and out of sight for t[MASK]e [MASK]iewer , alluding to the fact that bulbs can be on or off , curtains o[MASK]en or [MASK]losed . 
 The [MASK]igure 's mouth is opene[MASK] wide as if screaming , an[MASK]expression Bacon took from a still he kept of the nurse screaming i[MASK] Sergei Eisenste[MASK]n 's Odessa Steps massa[MASK]re sequence in his 1[MASK]25 silent film Battleship Potemkin . In 1984 , the broadcaster Melvyn Bragg asked Bacon about the still , and[MASK]observed th[MASK]t in his earlier career the artist seemed preoccupied with the physicality of the human mou[MASK]h . Bacon replied[MASK], " I had al[MASK]ays thought that I would be able to make the mouth with all the bea[MASK]ty of a Mon[MASK]t landscape though I never [MASK]ucceeded in doing so . " When Bragg asked why he thought he had fail[MASK]d , Bacon said , " It[MASK]should be all much more colour , should have got more of th[MASK] interior of the mouth , with all the colours of the interior of the mouth , but I didn 't happen to get it . " His interest in the mouth was further stimulated by a medical textbook of diseased oral caviti[MASK]s bought in a second @-@ hand bookshop [MASK] kept in his studio and to[MASK]which he often referr[MASK]d to . 
 The glass cage m[MASK]ght imply a vacuum that the figu[MASK]e 's voice is unable to escape ; as if it is screaming in silence . Rueful later in life , [MASK]acon said that he had " wanted to paint the scream more than the horror [MASK] I think , if I had really thought about wh[MASK]t causes somebody to really scream , it would have made the scream ... more successful " . The work evokes memories of the Second World War . The glass enclosure of his 1949 Chicago Study for a Portrait is often seen as prophesying photog[MASK]aphs of Adolf [MASK]ichmann 1961 trial before a Jerusalem District Court , when he was held within a sim[MASK]lar cage[MASK]. Bacon strongly resisted literal comparisons though [MASK] and stated that he use[MASK] the device so he could frame an[MASK] " really see the image – for no other reason . I know [MASK]t 's been interpreted as being many other things . " Other critics saw similarities between the glass case and the radio booths of late 1930s broadcasters who warned against the impending calamity . Denis Farr notes that Bacon was sym[MASK]atheti[MASK] to [MASK]eorge Orwell and referred in intervi[MASK]ws to Orwellian " shout[MASK]ng [MASK]oices ... and trem[MASK]ling hands ... convey[MASK][ ing ] the harsh atmosphere of an interrogati[MASK]n . "

 The so @-@ called " space frame " had already been used by Alberto Giacometti in the 1930s , and the two artists became fr[MASK]ends in the 1960s . However Giacometti had by [MASK]949 used it only in sur[MASK]ealist co[MASK]texts before Bacon 's adapt[MASK]on , and in turn in[MASK]luenced his use in " The Cage " of 1950 . A similar two di[MASK]ensional construct is fou[MASK]d i[MASK] Henry Moore 's wo[MASK][MASK]s , notably his " Maguette [MASK]or King and Queen " , co[MASK]structed thre[MASK] years after Bacon 's Head . It is difficult to untangle how these artists influenced and informed each other . What is[MASK]notable is that Baco[MASK] continued to use the motif , with intervals until the end of his life . Sylvester suggests his finest ex[MASK]mple is the 1970 Three Studies of the Male Back . 
 The full @-@ length golden curtain @-@ like folds painted in heavy bru[MASK]h strokes are [MASK]n part[MASK]influ[MASK]nced by Degas but al[MASK]o similar to Titian [MASK]s 1558 Portrait of Ca[MASK]dinal Filippo Arc[MASK]into . Bacon adapts the Old Ma[MASK]ter 's device to isolate and distance the sitter from [MASK]he viewer ; the black[MASK]ground @-@ paint is visible through the folds , making the separation all the more[MASK]affecting . Bacon [MASK]ad already used similar for[MASK]s in his Chicago panel , and they were to become a feature of his most acclaimed 1950s works , especially in his " screaming[MASK]popes " . He became fasc[MASK]nated with the vei[MASK] or c[MASK]rtain as a motif in painting , an[MASK] collected many reproductions of works by T[MASK]tian and Degas in which it i[MASK] employed . He had begun[MASK]his career as an interior decorator and designer of furniture and r[MASK]gs i[MASK] t[MASK]e mid @-@ 1930s [MASK] and later said that he liked " rooms hung all round with just curtains hung in even folds " . Veils or curtains appear in Bacon 's earliest works , notably the 19[MASK]9 Study from the Hu[MASK]a[MASK] Body , always in[MASK]portraits and alw[MASK]ys[MASK]in front of , rath[MASK]r than behind , the figure . 
 Head VI is closely modelled on Velázquez 's c . 1650 Portrait of Innocent X , today in the Doria Pamphilj Gallery , Rome . Bacon cautiously avoided seeing the original , even when he spent three months in Rome in 1954 . Critics speculate he was afraid of being disappointed , or thought that an intimate knowledge of the painting would dull his imagination .[MASK]Yet his fascinati[MASK]n was all @-@ consuming and he repro[MASK]uced variants of it obsessively for almost two decades ; an examination and homage described [MASK]s " [MASK]ithout paral[MASK]el in the history of art " . Bacon 's approach differs to Velázquez 's in a[MASK]n[MASK]mber of ways : both artists were expressive , yet Bacon 's broad bru[MASK]h @-@ strokes and freedom with paint cont[MASK]ast with Velázquez 's tig[MASK]t and controlled treatment . He adapts Velázquez 's positioning of the pope to place him above the vie[MASK]er 's point of view , elevating and distancing him . This was [MASK]lready a common[MASK]technique in commercial , promotional photography but in Bacon 's hands , Schmied argues , the angle places[MASK]th[MASK] pope on a kind of stage for the viewer to coldly observe [MASK] 
 Although Bacon rever[MASK]d Veláz[MASK]uez 's portrait , he did not try [MASK]nd reproduce the earlier [MASK]aintin[MASK] . In interviews , he said that he saw flaws in Velázquez 's work and that he viewed that social structure and order as , according to art histor[MASK]an Wieland Schmied , " obsolete and decayed " . Bacon 's approach was to elevate his su[MASK]ject so he could knock him down again , thereby making a sly comment on the treatment of royalty in both old master and contemporary painting . Yet Velázquez 's influence is apparent in many aspects [MASK]f the painting [MASK] The sitter 's [MASK]ose clos[MASK]ly e[MASK]hoes the original , as does the violet and white colourin[MASK] of his cope , which is built up through broad , [MASK]hick , brush @-@ strok[MASK]s . The influence can be further seen in the gold @-@ coloured orname[MASK]ts on the [MASK]ack of the seat that extend on both sides of the figure . Art historian Armin Zweite describes the work as a mixture of reverence and subversion that pays tribute to Velázquez , while at [MASK]he same time deconstructs his painting . 
 Sylvester detects the influence of[MASK]late works by Titian in other aspects , especially in the deep and rich [MASK]olouring , Velázquez 's portrayals of Phil[MASK]p IV ,[MASK]and agrees with [MASK]d[MASK]ntification of pastels of Edgar Degas as a source . He believes Bacon[MASK]borrowed from[MASK]Degas the use of parallel heavy folds to create the illusion of what Degas described as " shutte[MASK]ing " , as se[MASK]n in the earlier artist 's After the Bath , Woman drying herself . Sylvester makes a further direct link between the folds and the transparent veil in Titian 's Portrait of Cardinal [MASK]ilippo Archinto . He believes the folds serve to " push the[MASK]viewer back[MASK]" , creating a distance from th[MASK] subject , an effect he sees as simil[MASK]r to the sepa[MASK]ation between and orchestra and setting ; others view the folds as more closely resembling the bars of a prison . Sylvester describes [MASK]hem as an accentuation of backg[MASK]ound verticals into stripes that are made to appea[MASK] as if they pass through the sitt[MASK]r[MASK]. In his " Interviews with Francis Baco[MASK] " series of books , he asked Bacon why he found the effect so poignant . The artist replied , " Well , it means that the sensation doesn 't come straight out at you but slides slowly and gently through the gaps . " 
 When asked [MASK]hy he wa[MASK] compelled to rev[MASK]sit the Velázquez so often , Bacon replied that he had nothing against [MASK]opes per se , but merely sought " an excuse to use [MASK]hese colours , and you can[MASK]'t give ordinary[MASK]clothes that purple colour without getting into a sort of false fauve [MASK]anner . " Schmied sees Head VI as a reaction against Velázquez , and a commentary on how t[MASK]e papacy is " obsolete and[MASK]decayed " , with a pope resistant to both modernisation and secularisation . To [MASK][MASK]m , t[MASK]e figure seems to " resist the maltreatment of image and tries to halt the impendin[MASK] collapse of the established work order . He screams and grimaces , clutching at arms of his throne . " Sylvester notes that Bacon was impressed by Picasso 's figurat[MASK]on and handling of paint , especially in Picasso 's 1930s wo[MASK]ks ; and sugge[MASK]ts that the[MASK]white blobs around th[MASK] pope[MASK]'s cape may be influenced by the 1913 W[MASK]man in a Slip Seated in an Armcha[MASK]r . 
 
 = = Critical reception = = 
 
 When Bacon under[MASK]ook [MASK]he series late in 1948 he was somet[MASK]ing of a[MASK]two @-@ hit wonder . He had success in 1944 with Three Studies for Figures at [MASK]he Base of a Crucifixion and[MASK]to a lesser extent with Painting ( 1946 ) , both of whic[MASK] were highly regarded but viewed as sensationalist . The exhibition was[MASK]a success , and marked his critical breakthrough . Until then , he had been highly regarded but capable of only occasional brilliance .[MASK][MASK]he full show established him in th[MASK] minds of critics as , according to Michael Peppiatt , " more of a force to be reckoned with in the contemporary scene [MASK] . While some found his images horrifying and unnerving , they wrote about him all the same , sealing his reputation as the enfant terrible of post @-@ war British art . The critic for The Observer wrote , " The recent paintings ... horrifying as they are , cannot be ignored . Technically they are supe[MASK]b , and the masterly handling[MASK]of large areas of pearly grey , flu[MASK]he[MASK] with a sudden pink or green , only makes me regret t[MASK]e more th[MASK]t the artist 's gift sh[MASK]uld have been brought to subjects so esoteric[MASK]" . 
 Most cr[MASK]tics[MASK]focused on Heads I and VI , remarking favourably on the progressio[MASK] bet[MASK]een th[MASK] two . While some found the inherent violence of the painti[MASK]gs distasteful , Brausen was a skilled publicist and[MASK]turned the bad press [MASK]nto notoriety , and brought Bacon 's work to nationa[MASK] [MASK]tten[MASK]ion . Peppiatt notes that the exhibition showed Bacon no longer needed sensationalist material to make an impact , an[MASK] was now capable of creating an [MASK]ntense emotional response[MASK]through mo[MASK]e subtle means , and had found a way of presentin[MASK] the human condition in the way he had sought , by pre[MASK]enting his sitter " in a vestigial [MASK]etting , a ca[MASK]e or [ b[MASK]hind ] a parted curtin ... the rest , the most ess[MASK]nt[MASK]al , lay in the manipulation o[MASK] the infinitel[MASK] suggestive medium of oil paint " .[MASK]After the sho[MASK]ing Bacon gradually became " less the outsider with an occasional image of horrifying brilliance and more a force to be reckoned with on the contemporary scen[MASK] " . His reputation and t[MASK]e value of his panels rose dramatically , and after the showing he was sought [MASK]fter by European [MASK] American and African collectors and g[MASK]lleries , commanding prices[MASK]as high as £ 400 for single works , unusual for a contemporary British artis[MASK][MASK]of the time .

 = Imagism = 
 
 Imag[MASK]sm was a movement in early 20th @-@ century A[MASK]glo @-@ American poetry that favor[MASK]d precision of imagery a[MASK]d clear , sharp language . 
 Imagism has been described as the most influential movement in English [MASK]oetry since th[MASK] activity of the Pre [MASK]-@ Raphaelites . As a poetic styl[MASK] it gave Modernism i[MASK]s start in the early 2[MASK]th century , and is considered to be the first organized Modernist literary moveme[MASK]t in the English language . Imagism is s[MASK]metimes viewed as ' a succession of creative[MASK]moments ' rather than any continuous o[MASK] sustained per[MASK]od of[MASK]dev[MASK]lopment . René Taupin remarked that ' It is more accurate to consider Imagism not as a doctrine , nor even as a poetic school , but as the association o[MASK] a few poets who were f[MASK]r a certain time in agreement on a small number of[MASK]important principles ' . 
 The Imagists rejected the sentiment and discurs[MASK]veness typical of much Romantic and Victorian poetry , i[MASK] contr[MASK]st to their contempo[MASK]aries , the Georgian poets , who were generally content to work within[MASK]that tradition . In contrast , Imagism called for a return to what were seen as more Classic[MASK]l values , such as directness of p[MASK]esentation and economy[MASK][MASK]f language , as well as a will[MASK][MASK]gnes[MASK] to experiment with non [MASK]-@ traditional verse forms . Imagists use fr[MASK]e verse . 
 I[MASK]agist publications appearing between 1914 and 1917 f[MASK]atured[MASK]works[MASK]by many of the most promine[MASK]t modernist figures , both in poetr[MASK] and in other fie[MASK]ds . The Imagist group was centered in London , with members from Great Britain , Ireland and the United States . Somewhat unusually for the t[MASK]me , a number of women writers wer[MASK] major Imag[MASK]st figures . 
 A characteristic featur[MASK] of Imagism is its attempt to isolate[MASK]a single image to reveal its essence . This feature mirro[MASK]s contemporary deve[MASK]opments in avant @-@ garde art , especially Cubism . Although Imagism isolates objects through the use of what Ezra Pound called " luminous details " , Pound 's Ideogrammic Method of juxtaposing concrete ins[MASK]ances to express an abstraction is s[MASK]milar to Cubism[MASK]'s manner of synthesizing multiple perspectives int[MASK] a single image .

[MASK]Well @-@ known[MASK]poets of the Edwardian era of the 1890s , su[MASK]h as Alfred Austin , Stephen Phillips , and William Wa[MASK]son , had been working ver[MASK] much in the shadow of Tennyson , producing weak i[MASK]itations of the poetry of the Victorian era . They continued to work[MASK]in this vein in[MASK]o the early years of the 20th century . As the new century opened , Austin was still the serving British Poet Laureate , a post [MASK]hich he held up to 1913 . In the century 's first decade , poetry still had a large aud[MASK]ence ; volumes of verse pub[MASK]ished in that ti[MASK]e included Thomas Hardy 's The D[MASK]nasts , Christina Rossetti 's posthumous Poetical Works , Ernest Dowson 's Po[MASK]ms , Ge[MASK]rge Meredith 's Last Poems [MASK] Robert Service 's Ballads of a Cheechako and John Mase[MASK]ield 's Ballads and Poems . Future Nobel Prize winne[MASK] William Butler Yea[MASK]s was devoting [MASK]uch of his energy to the Abbey Theatre and writing for the stage , producing relatively little lyric poetry during this period . In 1907 , the Nob[MASK]l Prize for Literature was awarded to Rudyard Kipling . 
 The origins of Imagism are to be found in two poems , Autumn a[MASK]d A City Sunset by T. E. Hulme . These were publish[MASK]d in January [MASK]909 by the Poets ' Club in London in a booklet c[MASK]lle[MASK] For Christmas MDCCCCV[MASK]II[MASK]. Hulme was a student of mathematics and philosophy ;[MASK]he had been involved in[MASK]the setting up of the club in 1908 and was its first secretary . Around the end of 1908 , he presented his paper A Lecture[MASK]on Modern Poetry at one of [MASK]he club [MASK]s meetings . Writing in A. R. Orage 's magazine The New Age , the poet and critic F. S. Flint ( a champion of free verse and modern French poetry ) was highly critical of the club and its publications . From the ensuing debate , Hulme and Flint became close friends . I[MASK] 1909 , Hulme left the Poets ' Club and started meeting with Flint and other poets in a new group which Hulme referred to as the " Secession Club " ; they met at the Eiffel Tower restaurant in London 's Soho to discuss plans to reform[MASK]contemporary poetry through free verse and the tanka and[MASK]haiku and the removal of all unnecessary verb[MASK]age from poems . The interest in Japanese verse forms can be placed in a conte[MASK]t of the late Victorian and Edwardian revival of interest in Chinoi[MASK]erie and Japonism as witnessed in the 1890s vogue for William Anderson 's Japanese prints donated to the British Museum ,[MASK]performanc[MASK]s of Noh plays in London , and the success of Gilbert an[MASK] Sullivan 's operetta The Mikado ( 1885 ) .[MASK]Direct literary mo[MASK]els were available from a number of[MASK]sources , including F. V. Dickins 's 1866 Hyak nin [MASK]s 'shiu , or , Stanzas by a Century of Po[MASK]ts , Being Japanese Lyrical Odes , the fir[MASK]t English @-@[MASK]language version of the Hyakunin issh[MASK] , a 13th @-@ century anthology of 100 waka , the early 20[MASK]h @-@ century critical writings and poems of Sadakichi Hartmann , and contemporary French @-@ language translations . 
 The American po[MASK]t Ezra Poun[MASK] was introduced to the group in April 1909 and [MASK]ound that their ideas were close to his own . In particular , Pound 's studies of Romantic literature had led him to an admiration of the condensed , direct expression that he detected in the writings[MASK]of Arnaut Daniel , Dante , and Guido Cavalcanti , amongst others . For exampl[MASK] , in his 1911 – 1[MASK] series of essays I gather the limbs of [MASK]siris , Pound [MASK][MASK]ites of Daniel 's line " pensar de lieis m 'es repaus " ( " it rests me to think of her " ) ( from the canzone En breu brizara 'l temps braus ) : "[MASK]You cannot get statement simpler than that , or clearer[MASK], or less rhetorical " . These criteri[MASK] of directness , cl[MASK]rity and lack of rhetoric were to be amongst the defining qualities of Imagist poetr[MASK] . Through[MASK]his friendship with Laurence Binyon , Pound had already developed an interest in Japanese art by e[MASK]ami[MASK]ing Nishiki @-@ e prints at the Br[MASK]tish Muse[MASK]m , and he quick[MASK]y became absorbed in the study of related Japanese verse forms . 
 In an article in La Fran[MASK]e , 1915 , the French critic , Remy [MASK]e Gourm[MASK]nt [MASK]escribed the Imagists as descendants of the French Symbolistes and in a 1928 letter to the French critic and translator René Taupin , Pound was keen to emp[MASK]asise another ancestry for Imagism , pointing out that Hulme was i[MASK]debted to a Symbolist tra[MASK]ition , linking back via [MASK]illiam Butle[MASK] Yeats , Arthur Symo[MASK]s and the Rhymers ' Club generation of Brit[MASK]sh poet[MASK] to Mal[MASK]armé. and the Symbolist source was amplified further in Taupin 's study publi[MASK]hed in 1929 , in which he concluded however great the divergence of technique and language ' between the image of the Imagist and the ' symbol ' of the Symbolists there is a difference only of precision ' . In 1915 , Pound edited the poetr[MASK] of another 1890s poet [MASK] Lionel Johnson for the publisher Elk[MASK]n Mathews . In his introduction , he wrote

 In 1911 , Pound introduced two other poets to the Eiffel Tower g[MASK]oup : his former fiancée Hilda Doolitt[MASK]e ( who had started signing her work [MASK].D. ) and her future husband Richard Aldington . These two [MASK]ere i[MASK]terested in [MASK]xploring Greek poeti[MASK] models , especially Sappho , an interest tha[MASK] Pound shared . The compression of expression t[MASK]at [MASK]hey achieved by [MASK]ollo[MASK]ing the Greek example co[MASK]plemented the[MASK][MASK]roto @-@ Imagist inter[MASK]st in Japanese poetry , and , in 191[MASK] , during a meeting with them in the Brit[MASK]sh Museum tea room , Pound told H.D. an[MASK] Aldington that they were Imagistes and even appended the signature H.D. Imagiste to some [MASK]oems they were discussing . 
 Wh[MASK]n Harriet Monroe started her Poetry magazine in 1911 , she had asked Pound to act as foreign editor . In October 1912 , he submi[MASK]ted thereto [MASK]hree poems each by H.D. and Aldington under the I[MASK]agiste rubric , ( published i[MASK] the November 1912 second issue thereof ) with a note whic[MASK] described Aldingto[MASK] as ' one of the ' Imagistes [MASK] . This note , along with the a[MASK]pendix note ( ' The Complete Works of T. S. Hulme ' ) in Pound 's book ( also pu[MASK]lished in Au[MASK]umn 1912 ) ent[MASK]tled Ripostes are considered to be first appearances [MASK]f the word Imagiste ( later anglicised to ' Imagists ' ) in print . 
 Aldington 's poems , Chorico[MASK] , To a Greek Marble , and Au Vieux Jardin , were in the Novemb[MASK]r issue of Poetry , and H.D. ' s , Hermes of the Ways , Priapus , and Epigram , appeare[MASK] in the January 1913 issue ; Imagism as a mo[MASK]ement was launched .[MASK]Poetry 's April issue publi[MASK]hed what came to [MASK]e seen as " Imagism 's enabling text " , the haiku @-@ like poem of Ezra Pound entitled " In a Stat[MASK]on of the Metro " : 
 The apparition o[MASK] these faces in the crowd ; 
 Pe[MASK]als on a wet , black bough . 
 The March 1913 issue of Poetry contained A Few Don 'ts by an Imagiste and the essay entitled Imagisme both written by Pound , with the latter being att[MASK]ibuted to [MASK]lint . The latter contained this succinct statement o[MASK] the group 's position : 
 Direct treatment of the "[MASK]thing " , whether subjective or objective . 
 To use absolutely no word that does not contribute to the presentation . 
 [MASK]s regarding rhythm : to compose in sequence of the musical phrase , not in sequence o[MASK] th[MASK] metronome . 
 Pound 's note opened with a definition o[MASK] an image as " that which presents an intellectu[MASK]l and emotiona[MASK] complex in an instant of time[MASK]"[MASK]. Pound goes on to state , " It is better to present one Image in a lifetime[MASK]than to produce voluminous works " . His list of " don 'ts " reinforced his thr[MASK]e statements in " Imagism " , while warning that they should not be considered as dogma but as the " result of long contemplation " . Taken [MASK]ogether , thes[MASK] two texts comprised the Imagist programme for a return to what [MASK]hey saw as the best poetic practice of the past . F.S. Flint commented " we have never cl[MASK]imed to have i[MASK]vented the moon . We do not pretend that our ideas are original . " 
 The 1916 preface to Some Imagist Poets comments " Imagism does not merely mean the presentation of pictures . Imagism refers to the manner [MASK]f presentation , not to the subject . " 
 
 = = Des Imagistes = = 
 
 Determined to promote the work of[MASK]the Imagists , and particularly [MASK]f Aldington and H.D. , Pound decided to publish an anthology under th[MASK] title Des Imagistes . It was first published in Alfred Kreymborg 's little magazine The Glebe and was later[MASK]published in 1914 by Alfred and Charles Bo[MASK]i in New York and by Ha[MASK]old Monro at the Poetry Bookshop in London [MASK] It became one of the most important and influential English @-@ language collections of modernist verse . Includ[MASK]d in the thi[MASK]ty @-@ seven poems were ten poems[MASK]by Aldington , seven by[MASK]H.D. , and[MASK]six by Pound . The book also included work by F.S. Flint , Skipwit[MASK] Cannell , Amy Lowell , William Carlos Williams , James Joyce , Ford Madox Ford , A[MASK]len Upward and John Cournos.Max Mi[MASK]helson was also another included in [MASK]he important 1963 anthology by Wil[MASK]iam Pratt The Imagist [MASK]oem Modern Poetry in miniature . 
 Pound 's editorial choices were based on what he saw as the degree of sympathy that these[MASK]writers displayed with Imagist precepts , rather than active p[MASK]rticipation in a group as such . Williams , who was based in the United States , had not participated in any of the dis[MASK]ussions of [MASK]he Eiffel Tower group .[MASK]However , he[MASK]and Pound[MASK]had long been correspondin[MASK] on the question of the renewal of poetry along similar lines . Ford [MASK][MASK]s included at least partly because of hi[MASK] strong influence on Pound , as[MASK]the younger poet made the transition fr[MASK]m his earlier , Pre @-@ Raphaelite @-@ influenced style towards a harder , more modern way of writing . The inclusion of a poem by Joyce , I Hear an Army , which was sent to Pound by W.B. Yeats , took on a wider importance in the history o[MASK] literary modernism , as t[MASK]e subsequent cor[MASK]espondence between the two led to the serial publication , at Pound 's behest [MASK] of A Portrait of [MASK]he Artist as a[MASK]Young Man in The Egoist . Joyce 's poem is not writte[MASK] i[MASK] free verse , but in rhyming quatrains . However , it stro[MASK]gly reflects Pound 's interest in [MASK]oems written to be sung to music , such as those by the troubadours and Guido Cavalcanti . The [MASK]ook met with little popular or critical success , at least partly because it had no i[MASK]troduction or commentary to explain what the poets were attempting to do , and a number of copies were returned to the publisher .

 The follo[MASK]ing year , Pound and Flint[MASK]fell out over their diffe[MASK]ent interpretations of the history and goal[MASK] of the group arising from an article on the h[MASK]story of Imagism written by Flint and published in The Egoist in May 1915 . Flint was at pains to emphasise the contribution of the Eiffel Tower poets , especial[MASK][MASK] Edward Storer . Pound , [MASK]ho believed that the " Helleni[MASK] hardness " that he saw as the distinguishing quality of the poems of H.D. and Alding[MASK]on was likely to be diluted by the " custard " of Storer , was to play no further direct role in the history of the Ima[MASK]ists . He went on t[MASK] [MASK]o @-@ f[MASK]und the Vorticists with his frie[MASK][MASK] , the painte[MASK] and writer Wyndham Lewi[MASK] . 
 Around this time , the American Imagist Amy Lowell move[MASK] [MASK]o London , determined to promot[MASK] her own work and that of the other Imagist poet[MASK] . Low[MASK]ll was a wealthy heiress from Boston whose brother Abbott Lawre[MASK]ce Lowell was President of Harvard University from 1909 @-@ 1933 . She loved Ke[MASK]ts and cigars . She was al[MASK]o[MASK]an enthusiastic champion of literary experiment who was willing to use[MASK]her money to [MASK]ublish the group . Lowe[MASK]l wa[MASK] determined to c[MASK]ange the method of selec[MASK]ion from Pound 's autocratic editorial attitude to a more democratic m[MASK]nner . This new editorial policy was stated in [MASK]he Preface t[MASK] the first anthology to appear under her [MASK]eadership : " In this new book we have follow[MASK]d a slightly[MASK]different arrangemen[MASK] to that of our former An[MASK]hology . Instead of an arbitrary selection by an edit[MASK]r , each poet has been per[MASK]itted to repres[MASK]nt himself by the work he considers his b[MASK]st , the only stipu[MASK]ation being that it should not yet have appeared in book form . " [MASK]h[MASK] outcome was a series of Imagist anthologies under the title Some Imagist [MASK]oets . The first of these appeared in 1915 , planned and assembled mainly by H.D. and [MASK]ldingt[MASK]n . Two further issues , both edited by Lowell , were published in 1916 and 1917 . These three [MASK]olumes featured m[MASK]st of the original poets , ( also including imagis[MASK] poetry [MASK]y the American poet John Gould Fletcher ) , w[MASK]th the exception of Pound , who had tried to[MASK]persuade her to drop th[MASK] Imagist name from her publi[MASK]ations and who sardonically dubbed this phas[MASK] of Imagism " Amy [MASK][MASK]@ gism . " 
 Lowell [MASK]ersuaded D. H. Lawrence to contribute [MASK]oems to the 1915 and 1916[MASK]volumes , [MASK]aking him t[MASK]e only writer to publish as bot[MASK] a Geo[MASK]gian poet and an Imagist . Marianne[MASK]Moore also became associated with the group during this period . However , with W[MASK]rld War I as a backdrop , the times[MASK]were not easy for avant [MASK]-@ garde literary movements ( Aldington , for ex[MASK]mple ,[MASK]spent much of the war at the front ) , and the 1917 anthology effectively mar[MASK]ed the end [MASK]f the Imagists as a movement . 
 
 = = Imagists after Imagism = = 
 
 In 1929 , Walter Lowenfels jokingly sug[MASK]ested [MASK]hat Aldington should produce a new Imagist ant[MASK]ology . Aldington , by now[MASK]a succ[MASK]ssful novelist [MASK] took u[MASK] the suggestion an[MASK] enlisted the help of Ford and H.D. The result was the Imagist Antho[MASK]ogy 1930 , ed[MASK]ted by Aldington and including all the contributors to the four earlie[MASK] a[MASK]thologies with the exception [MASK]f Lowell , who had died , C[MASK]nnell , who had disappeared , and Pound , who declined . The appe[MASK]rance of this anthology initiated a critical discussion[MASK]of the place of the Imagists in the history of 20th @-@ centur[MASK] po[MASK]try . 
 Of the poets who were published in the various Imag[MASK]st antholo[MASK]ies , Joyce , Lawrence and Aldington are now primarily remembered and read [MASK]s novelists . Mar[MASK]anne Moore , who was at most a fringe member of the group , carved out a uni[MASK]ue poetic style of her own that retained an Imagist concern with compression of language . William Carlos Williams developed h[MASK]s poetic along distinctly American lines with his variable foot and a diction he claimed was [MASK]aken " from the mouths of Polish mothers " . Both Pound and H.D. turned to writing long poems , but retained much of the hard edge to their[MASK]language as an Imagist legacy . Most of the other members of the group are largely forgotten outside the c[MASK]ntext of the his[MASK]ory of Imagism .

 Despite the movement 's short life , Imagism would deeply influence th[MASK] course of modernist poetry in English . Richard Aldington , in his 1941 memoir , writes : " I think the poems of Ezra[MASK]Pound , D.H. , Lawrence , and Ford Madox Ford will continue to be read . And[MASK]to a considerable extent T. S. Eliot and [MASK]is followers have carried on their operations from positions won by the Imagists . " 
 On the other hand , Wallace Stevens found shortcomings in the Imagist approach : " Not a[MASK]l objects are equal . The vice of imagism was that it did not recognize this . " With its demand for hardne[MASK]s , clarity and precision and its insisten[MASK]e on fidelity to appearances coupled with [MASK]ts rejection of irrel[MASK]vant subjective emotions Imagism had later effects that are demonstratable in T. S. Eliot 's ' Preludes ' and ' Mornin[MASK] at the Window ' and in D. H. Lawrence 's animal an[MASK] flower pieces . The rejection of c[MASK]n[MASK]entional verse forms in the nineteen @-@ twenties owe[MASK] much to the Imagist[MASK] repud[MASK]ation[MASK]of the Geor[MASK]ian Poetry style . 
 The influence of Imagism can be see[MASK] clearly in the work of the Objectivist poets , who came to prominence in the 1930s under the auspices of Pound and Willi[MASK]ms . The Objectivists worked mainly in free verse . Clearly linking Objectivism 's principles with Imagism [MASK]s , Louis Zukofsky insisted , in his intr[MASK]duction to the 1931 Objectivist issue of Poetry , on writing " which is the detail , not mirage , of seeing , of thinking with the things as they exist , and of directing[MASK]them along [MASK] line of melody[MASK]. "[MASK]Zukofsky w[MASK]s a major influenc[MASK] on the Language poets , who carried th[MASK] Imagist focus on formal concerns to a high level of development [MASK] Ba[MASK]il Bunting[MASK], another Objectivist poet [MASK] was a key figure in the early development of the British Poetry Revival , a loose movement that also absorbed the influence of the San Francisco Renaissance poets . 
 Imagism influe[MASK][MASK]ed a number of poe[MASK]ry circles and movements.With the Imagist[MASK] Free verse became a discipline and acqu[MASK]red status as a legitimate poetic fo[MASK]m . In the 1950s , especial[MASK]y , with the Beat generation , the Black Mountain poets , and others associated with the San Francisco Renaissance . In his seminal 1950 essay Projective Ve[MASK]se , Charles Olson , the t[MASK]eorist of the Black Mountain group , wrote " ONE PERCEPTION MUST IMMEDIATELY AND DIRECTLY LEAD TO A FURTHER PERCEPTION " ; his credo derived[MASK][MASK]rom and supplemented the Imagists . 
 Am[MASK]ng the Beats , Gary Snyder and Allen Ginsberg in particular were influenced [MASK]y the Imagist emphasis on Chinese and Japanese poetry[MASK]. William Carlos Williams was another who had a strong effect on the Beat poets , encoura[MASK]ing poets like Lew Welch and writi[MASK]g an introduction for the book[MASK]pub[MASK]ication of Ginsberg 's Howl ( 1955 ) .

 Operation Eastern Exit was the codename given to the military evacuation of the United States embassy in Mogadishu , t[MASK]e capital of Somalia , in January 1991 . In late December 1990 , violence quickly envelo[MASK]ed the city as arme[MASK] militants began clas[MASK]ing with governme[MASK]t soldiers . On 1 January 1991 , the US Ambassador to Somalia , James Keough [MASK]ishop , contacted the Department of State requesting an evacuation of the embassy , which was approved [MASK]he following day . United [MASK]tat[MASK]s Central[MASK]Command began planning and mobilizing forces that evening . The initial plan was to evacuate with a military transport plane through the Mogadishu Interna[MASK]ional Airport , but this was later abandoned . A helicopter evacuation via the USS Guam and USS Trenton was the remaining option . 
 On[MASK]the morning of 5 January , a 60 @-@ person Marin[MASK] and Navy S[MASK]AL [MASK]ecurity detail was dispatched from Guam aboard two CH @-@ 53E Super Stallion helicop[MASK]ers to secure the embassy and prepare for the main evacuation .[MASK]The two helicopters returned to Guam with the first 61 evacuees . Throughout the day , foreign diplomats and civilians sought ref[MASK]ge at the embassy . Four [MASK]aves of five CH @-@ 46 Sea Knight helicopters each evacuated the embassy compound shortly after midnight on 6 January . The eva[MASK]uees were transported to Muscat , Oman , where[MASK][MASK]hey disembarked on 11 January . In total , 281 diplomats and civilians from 30 countries were ev[MASK]cuated , including 12 heads of missions ( eight ambassadors and four chargés d '[MASK]ffaires ) .

 In the late 1980s , there[MASK]was in[MASK]reasing rebellion against the rule of Somali President Siad Barre , a military dictator who maint[MASK]ined tight control of power and[MASK]had a record of hu[MASK]an rights abuses . [MASK]y 19[MASK]0 , wh[MASK]t began as civil disobedience evolved into a civil war , with se[MASK]eral militias organized to overthrow the central government . 
 In July 1989 , the embassy moved to a new , 80 @-@ acre ( 32 ha ) compound , 6 miles ( 9 @.@ 7 km ) from the previous embassy and J[MASK]mes [MASK]. Bishop was appointed as the United States ' am[MASK]assador to Somalia . Ambassador Bishop had s[MASK]gnificant experience in crisis management at US embassies . In 1967 , he was at the US Embassy in Beirut , Lebanon when the Six @-@ Day War erupted [MASK] About 3 @,@ 600 Americans were evacuated in 33 hours ; Bishop was one of 26 diplomats and soldiers that remained in the city . As deputy assistant secretary of state for Africa from 1981 – 87 , Bishop chaired several task forces for crises and gained experience in the State Department 's operations center as evacuations were carried out durin[MASK] several coups d 'etat . During his previous assignment as Ambassador to Liberia ( 1987[MASK]– 90 ) , Bishop was overseeing the voluntary e[MASK]acuation of embassy staff and civilians as a civil war in Liberia spread , when he left in March 1990 . Soon after returning to Washington to prepare for his new appointment to Somalia , he was appointed t[MASK] a taskforce to deal with the crisis in Liberia , which included a gradual e[MASK]acuation of American civilians and a rapid closure of the[MASK]embassy in August . 
 On 1 August , before leaving the US to take up his post in Mogadishu , Ambassador Bishop visited United States C[MASK]ntral Command — the military command for the Middle East and northeast Africa — where he spent most of the day with its commander , Gen[MASK] Norman S[MASK]hwarzkopf . Ambassador Bishop , aware of the ongoing strife , believed " the [MASK]dds were better than even that [MASK]e would have to leave Mogadishu under less than favorable circumsta[MASK]ces . " Ambassador Bishop understood from his past experiences in Beirut and L[MASK]beria the imp[MASK]rtance of being prepared to deal with emergencies and spent the afternoon working with military experts[MASK]to review the embassy 's Emergencies and Evacuation ( E & E ) plan until he was " satisfied ... that [ Central Command [MASK] r[MASK]alized that it might have to conduct an evacuation f[MASK]om M[MASK]gadishu and was [MASK]repared to do that . " I[MASK] its analysis of Operation Eastern Exit , the C[MASK]nter for Naval Analyses cited th[MASK] Ambassador Bishop 's previous experience and " clear understanding of his role " in the operation as one of the reasons Operation[MASK]Eastern Exi[MASK] went so well . 
 Hours after Ambassador Bishop 's visit to Central Command , Iraq invaded Kuwai[MASK] . In 1979 [MASK] the US negotiated access to an airport and port in both Mogadishu a[MASK]d Berbera ; because of limited access the US had to locations in the Persian Gulf area , maint[MASK]ining this access was a main interest for the Mogadish[MASK] embassy t[MASK] pursue as the US mobilized to intervene in Kuwait . [MASK] An increasing level of criminal violenc[MASK] prompted Ambassador Bishop to request the voluntary evacuation of dependents ( e.g. children and spouses of staff ) and non @-@ essential staff in early December , although fighting between the government and the United Somali Cong[MASK]ess ( a re[MASK]el militia ) remained no less than about 100 miles ( 160 km ) away . The voluntary evacuation later became a [MASK]andatory evacuation . By 19 December , the number of official US personnel in the city was re[MASK]uced from 147 to 37 ; around the same time , fighting betwee[MASK] the [MASK]overnment and rebels came within a[MASK]out 40 miles ( 64 km )[MASK]of Mogadishu .

 On 30 December , violence escalated " an order of [MASK]agnitude " [MASK]s militants e[MASK]tered Mogadishu , which was quickly enveloped by a general state of lawlessness . On 30 – 31 December , diplomats , including many stationed in offi[MASK]es elsewhere in the city , were collect[MASK]d and housed in the[MASK]e[MASK]bassy[MASK]compound ,[MASK]except two volunteers who rema[MASK]ned in the embassy 's K @[MASK]@ 7 residential apartments located across Afgoy Road from the embassy . The volunteers[MASK]in the K @-@ 7 b[MASK]ilding w[MASK]u[MASK]d be needed as look @-@ outs for the embassy compound 's main gate . On the morning of[MASK]31 December , the defense at[MASK]aché was nearly killed when his vehicle was spra[MASK]ed with bullets and that evening , a soldier at a roadblock shot the tires of a veh[MASK]cle carrying another defense of[MASK]icial . Attempts by the US and other nations ' diplomats[MASK], in particular the Italian embassy [MASK] to negotiate a ceasefire for foreigners to [MASK]eave were unsuccessful . Afgoy Road became a[MASK]" shooting gallery , " preventing those[MASK]i[MASK] safe @-@ havens o[MASK]tside the embassy from reaching it . On New Ye[MASK]r 's Day , the first American civilians began to seek refuge at the embassy . 
 Ambassador Bishop requested an evacuation of the American community on 1 Jan[MASK]ary , indicating that the evacuation could be with the planned Italian , French , or German evacuation [MASK]fforts , but preferred an evac[MASK]ation [MASK]y the US military . The State Department auth[MASK]rize[MASK] the evacuation on 2 January and on that day ,[MASK]Ambassador Bishop specifically requested an evacuation [MASK]y the US militar[MASK] , thereby initia[MASK]ing Opera[MASK]ion Eastern Exit . Ambassador Bishop had spent a considerable am[MASK]unt of time discussing contingency plans for evacuation with other diplomati[MASK] posts . Ultimately , ten heads of [MASK]issions — ei[MASK]ht ambassadors[MASK]and two chargés d 'affaires — alon[MASK] with their staff sought refuge in the US embassy compound and were evacuated .

 [MASK] Ambassador Bishop had visited Central Command in August 1990 , where he worked with mi[MASK]itary experts to update the embassy 's E & E [MASK]lan . The first no[MASK]ice that an e[MASK]acuation o[MASK] the Mogadishu embassy would be needed came on the m[MASK]rning of 1 January , when the top naval commander at Central Command [MASK]ent a message to his naval operations staff : " Better have Amphib crowd take a look at a helo NEO of Mogadishu ! time / distance to get there from Masirah OP area . " Following the ambassador 's 2 January evacuation request , the commander of[MASK]Central Command ordered Air Force aircraft to the region , the movement of a[MASK]phibious ships to Mogadishu , and[MASK]requested United States Special Operations Command to prepare for a noncombatant evacuation operation . 
 The initial plan was to evacuate via Mogadishu International Airport . Soon after the evacuation request , the Unite[MASK] States Air Force deployed C @-@ [MASK]30 transport planes and an AC @-@ 130 , for gunfire support , to Nairobi , Kenya , awaiting clearances[MASK]to enter Somalia and the ability to safely transfer[MASK]evacuees from the embassy to th[MASK] airport . However , the US and other foreign e[MASK]bassies were unable to contact anyone within the government to obtain cl[MASK]arances . It also became apparen[MASK] that the rebels had an ineffective command @-@ and @-@ control structure , making it imp[MASK]ssible to negotiate any cease[MASK]ire or guarantee of safe passage . Likewise , government tro[MASK]ps faced a command[MASK]@-@ and @-@ control prob[MASK]em ; rep[MASK]rts indicated that arm[MASK] units were separating along clan lines , in some cases soldiers shot officers of a different clan [MASK]hen given orders they disagreed with . Thus , it became clear that safe passage to the airport would not be possible . Several other nations also had aircraft mobilized to reach Mogadishu , but faced the same problems of landing and transit of e[MASK]acuees to the airport . 
 On 4 January ,[MASK]several incidents , i[MASK]cluding a couple exchanges of gunfire , suggested that the embassy 's security detail was insufficient to hold off armed Somalis until the USS Guam and USS Trenton arrived with their hel[MASK]copters and soldiers , at tha[MASK] time scheduled to arrive on 7 January . The embassy had just six Marine guards , whose job was[MASK]limited to protecting the chancery . Ambassador Bishop made an urgent request to Washi[MASK]gton for two platoons of soldiers to parachute into the embassy to defend it until the sh[MASK]ps ar[MASK]ived . The request was denied , but [MASK]he Ambassador was told that an adva[MASK]ce element from the v[MASK]ssels would reach the embassy the following morning . 
[MASK]USS Guam and USS Trenton beg[MASK]n transit from the coast of Oman towards Mog[MASK]dishu at 22 : 30 ( 23 : 30 Om[MASK]n time ) o[MASK] 2[MASK]January . The commander of Amphibious Group [MASK]wo h[MASK]d initially proposed a seven @-@ shi[MASK] Amphibio[MASK]s Task[MASK]Group , [MASK]omposed of vesse[MASK]s anchored at Masirah Island ( off Oman ) [MASK]nd Dubai and including [MASK]our amphibious ships so that the full range of amphibious capabilit[MASK]es would be avail[MASK]ble for the operation . However , in[MASK]ervention[MASK]in Kuwait seemed imm[MASK]nent and the commander of naval forces at Central Command did no[MASK] want to divert that many ships fro[MASK] the Persian Gulf , thus the decision to send two of the closest[MASK]ships .[MASK]Although the two v[MASK]ssels were selected by mid @-[MASK] afternoon on 2 January , the tra[MASK]sfer of some personnel [MASK]rom Dubai to Masirah caused a delay of eight to ten hours [MASK] Guam and Trenton carri[MASK]d forces from the 4th Marine Expedition[MASK]ry Brigade , inclu[MASK]in[MASK] a[MASK]detachment of CH @-@ 53E Super S[MASK]allion helicopters — the largest helicopters operate[MASK] by the US military — and two squadrons of CH @-@ 46 Sea Knight he[MASK]ico[MASK]ter[MASK] . 
 Planning began in earnest as the ships got underway , with a combined command center on Guam . On the morning of 3 January , the task force 's command questioned why they were not given the option of an amphibious landing and requested [MASK] tank landing ship be added to the t[MASK]sk force ; the request was denied . A warrant officer who had previously served as a Marine Security Guard at the Mogadishu embassy during the mid @-@ 1980s was found . Despite Ambassador Bishop 's pla[MASK]ning with Central Command , the task force was provided outdated information . The former MSG told planners that a new em[MASK]assy had been planned and was under construction several years prior . In fact , the new embassy was located further inland and , after receiving updated information , task force commanders determined that a beach landing , requiring troops to figh[MASK] the[MASK]r way across t[MASK]e city , was too risky . Initial pla[MASK]s had the ships launch thei[MASK] helicopters at 0[MASK] : 00 on 7 January . [MASK]o[MASK]ever , in response to indications from Am[MASK]assador Bishop [MASK]hat conditions in Mogadishu were deteriorating , planners considered 1 @,@ 050 @-@ nautical @-[MASK] mile ( 1 @,@ 940 km ; 1 @,@ 210 mi ) and , later , 890 @-@ nautical [MASK]-@ mile ( 1 @,@ 650 km ; 1 @,@ 020 mi ) flights with the[MASK]CH @-@ 53Es while the ships were still located in the northern Arabian S[MASK]a .[MASK]The situation in Mogadis[MASK]u s[MASK]abilized somewhat and the mission was delayed unt[MASK]l 5[MASK]January .

 On the evening of 4 January , the final execute order[MASK]was issued for a 02 : 45 launch of two CH @-@ 53E Super Stallions to arr[MASK]ve at the embassy at dawn . The 60 soldiers selected[MASK]for the security detail were issued weapons and ammunition . Two [MASK]arine Corps [MASK]C @-@ 130 refueling [MASK]ankers were mobilized closer to the operation , from Bahrain to Oman , to refuel the helicopters en rou[MASK]e to Mogadishu a[MASK]d the two helicopters transferred from Trenton to Guam .

 Two CH @-@ 53E Super Stallions c[MASK]rryi[MASK]g a 60 @-@ m[MASK]n security detail — 51 Marines and nine Navy SEALs — departed Guam at 02 : 47 , 4[MASK]6 nautical miles ( 863 km ; 536 mi ) from the embassy , and were expected to arrive at 06 : 20 [MASK] They perfor[MASK]ed two aerial refuelings . During the first refueling , a pipe burs[MASK] on one of the helicopters , d[MASK]using soldiers in fuel and nearly forcing a return to th[MASK] Guam ; prob[MASK]ems with the helicop[MASK]ers ' navigation system a[MASK]so complicated the refueling rendezvous . The helicopters arrived in Mogadishu at dawn , crossing the coast j[MASK]st[MASK]south of the harbor at 25 – 50 feet ( 7 @.@ 6 – 15 @.@ 2 m ) in altitud[MASK] on a route that was planned to avoid areas of more intense violence reported in the northern parts of the city . On their arriva[MASK] in Mogadishu , the crew of the helicopters were using an outdated 1969 map , which showed the embassy in an isolated area . F[MASK]rthermore , they had been told the embassy could be discerned by its white stucco perimeter wal[MASK] and golf course . The embassy was , in f[MASK]ct , surrounded by new development and the crew saw white stucco walls around many[MASK]buildings in the city . The helicopters were flying too low to[MASK]spot a str[MASK]be light which was placed on the embassy 's water tower ( the highest point within the embassy compound ) and the golf course in the embassy compound had a black , oil @-@ coated surface — not the familiar green grass[MASK]that the helicop[MASK]er[MASK]crew would recognize.After breaking radio silence ( their only direct communication wit[MASK] the embassy was unencrypted[MASK]) to contact the embassy , [MASK]hey were able to discern i[MASK] and land at 07 : 10 . As they arrived , a group of about 100 to 150 So[MASK]alis were attempting to enter the embassy compound via ladders on the wall , but scattered as the helicopters arrived . 
 The security det[MASK]i[MASK] moved to establish a perimeter aroun[MASK] t[MASK]e embassy compound and the Air Force 's AC @-@ 130 arrived to provide overhead support . Ambassador Bishop gave [MASK]he security detail clear instructions on the[MASK]rules of engagement : the[MASK] could only use deadly force if peop[MASK]e came over the embassy compound 's walls with obvious hostil[MASK][MASK]intent . He also identified three zones of d[MASK]fense , stating a preference to retreat to the third zo[MASK]e before the use[MASK]of deadly force : 
 the entire embassy compound 
 the Chancery , Joint Administrative Office ( JAO ) buildi[MASK]g , Marine House , and the helicopter landing zone ( HLZ )[MASK]
 the cha[MASK]cery and JAO buildings ( the two " safehaven " buildings wher[MASK] the evacuees were held ) 
 Ambassador Bishop clearly explained his rationale to the security detail , which was to avoid an[MASK] i[MASK]pression that they were intervening in t[MASK]e violence i[MASK] Mogadishu . He feared that the em[MASK]assy would be targeted[MASK]by organized attacks if any group involved in the clashes got the impression [MASK]hat the US wa[MASK] intervening in the conflict . To t[MASK]is effect , he reque[MASK]ted the Voice of America and BBC broadcast announcements that the forces were present o[MASK]ly to[MASK]evacuate the embassy and[MASK]would not interfere in the [MASK]onflict . The Ma[MASK]ines who had been[MASK]doused in fuel during the r[MASK]fueling were [MASK]ble to take a shower and w[MASK]sh their clothes . 
 After an hour on[MASK]the ground , the helico[MASK]ters left with the [MASK]irst 61 evacuees , includin[MASK] all American civilian[MASK] and four heads of mission . Evacuees were provided blankets on one of the flights to remain warm . Complications with the[MASK]only in @-@ flight refueling on the return nearly prevented refuel[MASK]ng , whi[MASK]h would have forced the [MASK]elicopters to divert to the Somali desert and awa[MASK]t a rescue . At 9 : [MASK]0 [MASK] t[MASK]e helicopters a[MASK]rived on Guam and unloaded the evacuees . 
 
 = = = Embas[MASK]y during the day = = = 
 
 No threats came upon the embassy during the day , although truckloads of armed Somalis frequently d[MASK]ove by the embassy al[MASK]ng Afghoy Road . Only one incident seemed to directly target the embassy . A sn[MASK]per and a spotter wer[MASK] positioned on th[MASK] emba[MASK]sy 's water tower ( the highest structure in the compound ) and came under fire ; they were ord[MASK]red[MASK]to not return fire and[MASK]soo[MASK] thereaft[MASK]r ordered to leave their position on the water tower . 
 The Office [MASK]f Military Cooperation , just one and a hal[MASK] blocks from the emb[MASK]ssy , required evacuation . De[MASK]pite its proximity to the embassy [MASK] an armed convoy was needed[MASK]to evacuate persons trap[MASK]ed there by the unrest . A [MASK]onvoy of vehicles with several Marines and SEALs left the embassy[MASK]at 8 : 47 [MASK]nd returned ten minutes later with 22 persons from the OMC[MASK]( [MASK]our Americans , a Filipino , and 17 Kenyans ) . This was the only excursion outside the embassy by the security [MASK]etail . Throughout the[MASK]day , foreign diplomats contacted the embassy desiring[MASK]to be evacuated ; the US welcomed these [MASK]equests , but required all of[MASK]them to find their own transportation to the embassy . 
 A Somali officer who h[MASK]d a previous relationship with the embassy , Major Siad , agreed[MASK]to travel [MASK]o rescue the German chargé d 'affaires and British a[MASK]bassador ( junior s[MASK]aff from the British embassy had previously come to the US embassy ) . The Soviet Union was [MASK]na[MASK]le to land a[MASK]plane in Mogadishu the previous day and the Soviet ambassador asked Ambassador Bishop if he and his staff could be rescued ; Ambassador Bi[MASK]hop , a tennis p[MASK]rtner of his Soviet counterpart , agreed but only if they found th[MASK]ir own way to the embassy . Seeing the helicopte[MASK]s on the morning of 5 January , they realized the Americans would not rema[MASK]n in the city much longer . At the request of Ambassador Bishop , Major Siad agreed to transport the Soviets , but only if he was paid enough ; the US embass[MASK] paid Major Siad , who returned with the Sovie[MASK] amba[MASK]sador and[MASK]38 [MASK]f his staff . The brother of [MASK]resident Barre , who was also a Major General and Chief of Police , showed up at the embassy in the afternoon with 25 members of his family requesting to be evacuated , but was turn[MASK]d away after a vocal conversation with the [MASK]mbassador . 
 The operation did not include soldiers to handle the evacuation control center ( ECC ) , which was set up in the JAO . A 44 @-@ person force consisting primarily of soldiers to handle the ECC was planned f[MASK]r insertion with the CH @-@ 53E Super Stallions after they had returned to the Guam . However , this was can[MASK]elled over objections from the commander of the security detail [MASK] The deficit was[MASK]partiall[MASK] handled by embassy staff who assisted a few soldiers from the security deta[MASK]l . The evacuees were groupe[MASK] into 15 @-[MASK] person " stick[MASK] " to be loaded onto the helicopters and were limited to one piece of luggage apiece . Some att[MASK]mpted[MASK]to bring more , resulting i[MASK] problems coordinating their evacuation . Furthermore , many evacuees had pet[MASK] they wanted to bring , which were not allowed . Most pets were killed by their owners ; some were given poison . Meanwhile , th[MASK] soldiers were allowed to consume[MASK]anything they want[MASK]d from the embassy 's c[MASK]mmissary , such as candy , sodas , and souvenirs ( most had been sta[MASK]ioned on ships for several months ) . They were also allowed use or take anything they[MASK]neede[MASK] from the embassy ;[MASK]the medic filled several bags with medical supplies to return to the ship . 
[MASK]As evening approached , w[MASK]rk began to prepa[MASK]e t[MASK]e HLZ for t[MASK]e main ev[MASK]cu[MASK]tion [MASK] The area was used as a pa[MASK]king lot and [MASK]evera[MASK] vehicles[MASK]were left without [MASK]eys by staff that had already been[MASK]evacuated . Some cars had to be broken into to be moved . Chemical lights were placed[MASK]in [MASK]he HLZ in a NATO " Y " pattern . The entire mission would be conduc[MASK]ed with night vis[MASK][MASK]n goggles , whi[MASK]h[MASK]required a[MASK]l lights in the embassy compound to be turned off .

 The main evacuation occurred in the early morning hours of 6 J[MASK]nuary [MASK]nd consisted of [MASK]our waves of five CH @-@ 46 helicopters . The timing of this phas[MASK] was determin[MASK]d by range of the [MASK]H @-@ 46 Sea Knight , which lack aerial [MASK]efueling capability ; the[MASK]ships were about 350 – 380 nautical miles ( 650 – 700 km ; 400 – 440 mi ) away during this phase . An AC @-@ [MASK]30 was sent from Saudi Arabia to provide gun[MASK]ire support during the evacuation and two UH @-[MASK] 1 Iroquois hel[MASK]copters were on standby to provide gunfire support , but were not de[MASK]loyed . 
 The first wave departed Guam at 23[MASK]: 43 . As the second wave landed , Major Siad arrived at the embassy gate accompanied by two truckloads of soldiers and [MASK]eld a grenade in one[MASK]hand and a radio in the other . His req[MASK]est to speak with the ambassador was granted[MASK]. Major Siad demanded that the evacuation cease immediately because the Somali [MASK]ov[MASK]rnment had not granted the US pe[MASK]mission to carry ou[MASK] such a milit[MASK]ry operation . He claimed that he would radio soldiers to shoot down the helicopters if the op[MASK]ration continued . The [MASK]econd and third waves were able to depart with[MASK]ut incident as the amba[MASK]sador negotiated with the Major , who f[MASK]nally agreed to sett[MASK]e the matter for s[MASK]v[MASK]ral [MASK]housand dollars in cash and key[MASK] to the ambassador 's armored car . Ambassador Bishop remained engaged in conversation with the Major until he reached the helicopter landing zone to depart with the final wave to prevent[MASK]the Major from re[MASK]eging on the deal . The final wave departed the embassy[MASK]at 1 : 49 and landed on Guam at 2 : 23 ; twenty m[MASK]nutes later , Ambassador Bishop declared the evacuation complete .

 Armed looters were observed enteri[MASK]g the embassy compound as th[MASK] final wave departed . Th[MASK] doors of the chancery — the main building of the embassy — were reportedly blown open by R[MASK]Gs within two hours of the embas[MASK]y 's evacuation . Somali employees of the embassy — [MASK]nown as foreign service nationals ([MASK]FSNs [MASK] [MASK] could not be evacu[MASK]ted . Ambassador Bishop tried unsuccessf[MASK]lly to have these e[MASK]ployees airlifted to safer parts of Somalia . Many of the FSNs had sought refuge in the e[MASK]bassy with their families and about 30 were hired as guards and protected the embassy throughout the ordeal . Local banks had been closed for some time and the embassy was unable to pay the FSNs . The Ambassador left the FSNs with keys [MASK][MASK] the commissary and warehouse on t[MASK]e embassy compound and [MASK]hey [MASK]er[MASK] permitted to take anything they needed .

 A total o[MASK] 281 evacuees were taken from the [MASK]mbassy , including 12 heads of missions ( eight ambassadors and f[MASK]ur chargés d 'affaires )[MASK]and 61 Americans ( inc[MASK]uding Ambassador Bishop and 36 embassy staff ) . The [MASK]eads of miss[MASK]on were the ambassadors of t[MASK]e United States , Kenya , Nigeria , Soviet Union , Sudan , Turkey , United Arab Emirates [MASK] and United Kingdom and the chargés of the embassies of Germany , Kuwait , Oman , and Qatar . 
 Rather than disembark in nearby Mombasa , as originally thought by the evacuee[MASK] , the ships were ordered back to Oman — a five @-@ day journey . The[MASK][MASK]ailors and marines made way for the evacuees to share living quarters . When the chaplain of Guam asked crew to sign up as guides for the evacuees while aboard the vessel , two hundred signed up within an hour , and some of the sailors even dressed up as cl[MASK]w[MASK][MASK] to ease th[MASK] ordeal for children . At the request of the[MASK]ambassadors , a formal session w[MASK]th the ships ' senior officers was[MASK]hel[MASK] to express th[MASK]ir thanks [MASK] On 11 January , the evacuees were offloaded at Muscat , Oman . That afternoon , the American evacuees were flown to Frankfurt[MASK], Germany , [MASK]rom where they continued home .

 The 2010 Claxton Shield was the 57th Claxton Shield tournament , the premier baseball competition in Australia , and was held from 6 November 2009 to 7 February 2010[MASK]. It was hai[MASK]ed as the precursor to the new Australia[MASK] Baseball L[MASK]ague t[MASK]at will start in the place o[MASK] the Claxton Shield in late 2010 to early 2011 . The Victoria Aces defeated South Austra[MASK]ia two games to nil [MASK]n the championship series[MASK]t[MASK] win t[MASK]e tournament ; this was the 22nd time the Claxton Shield had been awarded to a Victorian team . The competition was sponsored by[MASK]Domino 's Pizza . 
 At the conclusion of the regular season , the Victoria Aces finished in first place [MASK]ith a 17 – 7 record , earning home @-@ field advantage for the three @-@ game champi[MASK]nship series . South Australia hosted the three @-@ game semi @-@[MASK]final series against the New South Wales Patriots . Both teams finished with a 14 – [MASK]0 record .

 In June 2009 , it was annou[MASK]ced[MASK]that the rights[MASK]to the Claxton Shield had been sold to[MASK]a new Australian Baseball League ( ABL ) , with ownership s[MASK]lit between Major League Baseball 's 75 percent share [MASK]nd the 25 percent share owned by the Australian Baseball Federation . The 2010 tournam[MASK]nt was considered preparation for the inaugural ABL season starting in 2010 – 11 . It varied from the 2009 Claxton Shield[MASK]by expanding the season to include ten rounds . Since an une[MASK]en number ( five ) teams were involved , four teams paired off for each round and pla[MASK]ed a three @-@ game series , while the remaining team took a bye . During the season , each team had two bye rounds and played two round[MASK] against each other team , one at home and one away . In tota[MASK] , t[MASK]e schedule allowed fo[MASK] 24 regular @-@ sea[MASK]on games per team before a postseason similar to the 2009 edition : the first @-@ place team directly qualified [MASK]or the [MASK]hampionship series and[MASK]played against the winner of a playoff series between the second- and third @-@ place te[MASK]ms . 
 During the reg[MASK]lar season , [MASK]ames were[MASK]pla[MASK]ed on a Friday night and[MASK]a doubleheader on Saturday ; in each doubleheader one of th[MASK] two games was shortened to seven innings .

 The 2010 Claxton Shield was c[MASK]ntested between five teams from around Australia . In previous years , many of the teams had played their home games at multiple venues . This season each team held their home games at only one venue . There was one scheduled exception to this at the start of the season : the New South Wales Patriots ' final home series against the Perth Heat was held at Gilchrist Ov[MASK]l , whereas all of the[MASK]r other home games were held at Blacktown Baseball Stadium . 
 As a[MASK]result of poor at[MASK]endance at Geelong Baseball Park , game one of the fifth @-@ round series between New South Wales and [MASK]he Victoria Aces was moved to La Trobe Unive[MASK]sity , Melbourne . Although the Geelong games had attracted crowds of no more than 500 , the moved [MASK]ame had [MASK]n attendance [MASK]f 2 @,@ 200 . Though no further regular season gam[MASK]s were moved , the finals series hosted by the Aces was held at La Trobe University as well . 
 The venues are as follows :

 Independiente is the thirteent[MASK] Spanish @-@ [MASK]anguage studio album by Gua[MASK]emalan singer @-@ song[MASK]riter Ricardo Arjona , released on 23 September 2011 . Recorded in the United States and Mexico , it was produced by Arjona with Dan Warner , Lee Levin and Puerto Rican singer @-@ songwriter Tommy Torres . The album — the first independent release by Arjona af[MASK]er he was signed by Sony Music in 1993 and Warner Music in [MASK]0[MASK]8 — was issued by his own label ,[MASK]Metamorfosis . 
 Co[MASK]posed and written in a y[MASK]ar , the record marks Arjona and Torres ' fourth collaboration . For Inde[MASK]endiente , Arjona returns to his trademark sound after his s[MASK]ylistic departure for Poquita Ropa ( 2010 ) . W[MASK]ile p[MASK]od[MASK]cing[MASK]the lat[MASK]er [MASK] he had used fewer instruments to simplify his sound , having introduced what had been called a " stripped @-@ down acoustic effort " in his music . Independiente has been comp[MASK]red to his earlier recordings ,[MASK]Historias ( 1994 ) and Animal Nocturno ( 1993 ) . 
 Independiente became [MASK]rjona 's fourth number @-@ one album on the Billboard Top Latin Albums where it de[MASK]uted for the week ending 22 October 2011 . Fo[MASK] thirteen non @-@ consecutive weeks it topped the Latin Pop A[MASK]bum[MASK] chart , and reached number one on the Mexic[MASK]n Albums Chart . It is his fifth consecutive album to chart on the Billboard[MASK]200 ( reaching number sixty @-@ five ) [MASK] and his fourth a[MASK]bum to chart in Spain ( peaking at number [MASK]ixty @-@ eight ) . Within one week after its releas[MASK] Independiente was certified gold in C[MASK]ile , t[MASK]e United States an[MASK] Mexico and certified platinum in Venezuela and Argentina . 
 Five singles have be[MASK]n released from the alb[MASK]m . The lead single , " El Amor " , became a commercial success in several Latin American c[MASK]untries and was [MASK]umber one on the Billboard La[MASK]in Songs and Latin Pop Songs charts . It was followed [MASK]y " Fuiste Tú " ( featuring G[MASK]by Moreno ) , which reached number one on the Lati[MASK] Pop Songs , number two on the Latin Songs charts and topped several other national charts . " Mi Novia Se Me Está Poniendo Vieja " was released in May 2012 ; " Te Quiero " in Ju[MASK]y 2012 , and " Si Tu No Existieras " in November 2012 . To promote Independiente , Arjona[MASK]embarke[MASK] on his Metamorfosis World Tour .

 In 2010 , [MASK]rjona wanted to change hi[MASK] m[MASK]sical style ; after experimenting with using as few instruments as possible , he obtained a sound similar to an a capella per[MASK]orman[MASK]e ( sim[MASK]lifying hi[MASK] sound ) and introduced what he called a " stripped @-@ down acoustic effort [MASK] to his music . This was heard on his twelfth studio album , Poquita Ropa . Arjona produced[MASK]the album with Dan W[MASK]rner , who has worked with Shakira , Celine [MASK]ion and Christina Agu[MASK]lera .[MASK]When promoting the album Arjona said , " [MASK] songs ] are like women ; they get[MASK]things up and are so concerned about this that they forget[MASK]that the less clothes , more beauty . The songs ar[MASK] often overwhelmed by ourselves , because we saturate[MASK]the[MASK] with arrangements looking to exalt their qualities an[MASK] we e[MASK]d up hiding them " . Poquita Ropa became t[MASK]e first album since Adentro which Arjona recorded with[MASK]ut Torres . 
 Weeks before the release of Independiente , Arjona iss[MASK]ed a letter[MASK]raising the issue of his[MASK][MASK]ast relationships with[MASK]recording compa[MASK]ies . He revealed the cir[MASK]u[MASK]stances of [MASK]is first contract : " a produce[MASK] , fri[MASK]nd of mine , told them [ the rec[MASK]rd label ] that if they did not sign me in , [MASK]hey won 't sign two artists he had [ at that time ] "[MASK]. Arjona[MASK]further explained that he received the " minimum royalty percentage " from his most success[MASK]ul albums . Independiente is Arjona 's first ind[MASK]pendent release through his own label : Metamorfosis , a company he created to refocus his career . The company is presided by Arjona and several friends ( incl[MASK]ding photograph[MASK]r @-@ director Ricardo Calderón , Universa[MASK] Music México execut[MASK]ve Humberto Calderon and BMG 's Miriam Sommerz ) , and [MASK]s based in Miami and Mexico City . [MASK]rjona[MASK]commented that his independence re[MASK]resented com[MASK]romise more than freedom , st[MASK]ting that " Inside the word ' Independent ' , even when it sounds like extreme freedom , there 's a big amount of compromise and the responsibility of being able to administrate , in the be[MASK]t way possible[MASK], such independence " . Billboard notes that , although other groups have relea[MASK]ed independen[MASK] albums following contracts with m[MASK]jor labels[MASK], Arjona is t[MASK]e most important Latin pop artist to do so . Although the album is marketed within the n[MASK]w label , distrib[MASK]tion was handle[MASK] by Warner Music .

 Independiente marked Arjona 's fourth collaboration with Torres . T[MASK]e latter was a composer and producer , also receiving background @-@ vocal credit . The musicians first worked together in 2005 , when Arjona released hi[MASK] tenth studio album ( Adentro ) . He stated t[MASK]at he first " tested " Torres by sending him the " hookiest and darkest tracks " on the album : " Acompañame A [MASK]star Solo " and " Iluso " . Torres then " went all out on the first demo , hirin[MASK] a full band that included a string orchestra " . In Quién Dijo Ayer ( 2007 ) , T[MASK]rres produced [MASK]he singles " Quién " a[MASK]d "[MASK]Quiero " and provided backgrou[MASK]d vocals on the remastered versions of Arjona 's past hits . In 5to[MASK]Piso ( 2[MASK]08 ) , Torres produced several tracks ; one was the lead single " Como Duele " , considered Arjona 's " biggest [MASK]it in years " by Jason Birchmeier of Allmusic . 
 The album was composed over a one @-@ year period . Most of its production wa[MASK] [MASK]andled by three producers familiar with Arjona 's work : Dan Warner , Lee Levin and Dan Rudin . Tommy Torres also produced three tracks : the [MASK]ead single " E[MASK] Amor " , second single " Fu[MASK]ste Tú " and " Hay Amores " . Victor Patrón produced two songs , ( " Caudillo " and the piano version of " Mi Novia [MASK]e Me Está Poniendo Vieja " ) and Ju[MASK]io Ch[MASK]vez ai[MASK]ed in the p[MASK]oduction of " Reconciliación " . Arjona wrote all[MASK]the songs except " El Amor[MASK]" ( which was co @-@ written with Torres ) . The album was recorded and produced in several cities [MASK]n the United States and Mexico . Independiente was mixed at the Blue Grotto in Nashville , Tennessee , and mastered by Tom[MASK]Coyne and[MASK]Aya Merri[MASK]l at Sterling Sound [MASK]n New York City . With Torres ' return to producing Arjona regained the classic , trademark so[MASK]nd which Torres helped devel[MASK]p since 2005 .

 Independien[MASK]e opens with " Lo Que[MASK]Está Bien Está Ma[MASK] " , a Latin pop song and the only track composed by Dan Warner instead of Arjona ( who wrote the lyrics ) . " El Amor " was moti[MASK]ated by Arjona 's desire to examine " those big , dark ev[MASK]nts within love that nobody talks about " ;[MASK]he contin[MASK]e[MASK] , "[MASK][ the ] dark sides of love are extremely fundamental to understand its great value . " Arjona[MASK]added , " So many good things a[MASK]oul[MASK] love has been shown that somebody had to turn it around and tell the bad ones " . In a February 2012 interview , Arjo[MASK]a stated that " El Amor " was the " most tawdry " song he had r[MASK]leased to date , explaining that their choice of the song was a " contradiction " because it was not " the song which could[MASK]better represent the entire album " . He descri[MASK]ed it as [MASK] very strong " and " a bit dark " . The single marked Arjona 's return to his signature , mainstream sound aft[MASK]r the Cuban music[MASK]influenced Poquita Ropa 's lead s[MASK]ngle " Puente " , a mixture of salsa and merengue which failed to make an impact in the United States . 
 The album includes " Fuiste Tú " , a duet with Guatemalan singer Gaby Moreno . Its instrumentation consists of piano , violin , g[MASK]itars , drums and other percussion . Although Arjona st[MASK]ted that he " had the possibilities to record this song with very[MASK]well kn[MASK]wn people " he expre[MASK]sed[MASK]hi[MASK] happiness with Moreno , revealing[MASK]that " the possibilities of doing it [MASK]ith her , for me , are a celebration " . He described Mo[MASK]eno as " incredibly talented " , a "[MASK]co[MASK]ntrywoman " and a " fantastic human being " . Arjona named " Fuist[MASK] Tú " as o[MASK]e of the most important son[MASK]s on the album . " Mi [MASK]ov[MASK]a Se Me Está Poniendo Vieja " took two years to complet[MASK] and Arjona dedicated i[MASK] to his mother , Noemí Morales . He stated that he wrote it " as a gift for my mom on Mother 's [MASK]ay " and that he thought " the idea of including [MASK]t on the album was very good " . As with his single " Señora D[MASK] Las Cuatro Decada[MASK] " ([MASK]on 1994 's Historias ) , at first he nev[MASK]r thought to include the song on an album . " Caudillo " evokes [MASK] the image of some friends " Arjona had at college ; he asserted that he "[MASK]appears constantly[MASK]there because sometimes we transform ourselves into a contradictio[MASK] of all those things we fought in those moments . It 's the history of a student leader that becomes a president " . A[MASK]jona dedicated th[MASK] album to his father , who died in 2011 .

 Independiente was first digitally released in some South American countries on 23 September 2011 as a special edition , dubbed[MASK]the Cono Sur Edition . This version included a different mix of " Reconciliación " . On 30 September , t[MASK]e digital download [MASK]or the standard edition of the album was released in several Latin American and European cou[MASK]trie[MASK] . On 4 October , th[MASK] album was[MASK]officially [MASK]eleased as a digital download and compact disc in most[MASK]of these same markets as well as North America ; an iTunes edition was released as a digital download o[MASK] the iTunes music stor[MASK] . This version included an album @-@ only video , entit[MASK]ed " Independiente " . In Germany , the album was first av[MASK]ilable [MASK]n the Kiwi label on 4 October and on 11 October th[MASK]oug[MASK] Warner Music [MASK] In Canada and Spain , the compact @-@ disc version of the album was availabl[MASK] on 25 October[MASK]. 
 Arjona appeared on a tele[MASK]ision [MASK]pecial i[MASK] 2011 to promote In[MASK]ependiente . The s[MASK]ecial featured guest a[MASK]pearances by Gaby Mor[MASK]no , Ricky Muñoz ( [MASK]f the Mexican band Intoc[MASK]ble ) and Paquita la del Barrio . Broadcast by Televisa , the program showcased the fourteen songs on Independiente . Muñoz said that he was " happy to do things for Ricardo [ Arjona ] " , elabora[MASK]ing[MASK]that they met each other " [MASK]ome time ago " and it was " a very special situation " [MASK] The show was later rebroadcast on 5 November by Canal de las Es[MASK]rellas .

 The first single from Independiente is " El Amor " , released on 23 August 2011 . In the United States it reached number one on the Billboard Top Latin Songs chart ( Arjona 's four[MASK]h number one[MASK]on that char[MASK] , following " Desnuda " , " Cuando " and " El Problema " ) and number one on the [MASK]illboard Latin Pop Songs chart . It wa[MASK] also a hit in Latin America , reaching number one in Argentina , Mexico , Colombia , Venezuela , Chile , Costa Rica , [MASK]anama and Guatemala . The music video for " El Amor " [MASK] filmed in [MASK]lack @-@ and @-@ w[MASK]ite , was released on 8 September 20[MASK]1 . It was directed by Ricardo Calderón ( who also directed Arjo[MASK]a [MASK]s musi[MASK][MASK]video for " Como Duele " ) and filmed in Mexico City . The second single from the album is [MASK] Fuiste Tú " , a duet with Guatemalan singer Gaby[MASK]Moreno . The [MASK]u[MASK]ic v[MASK]deo for the song was shot in Guatemala ( [MASK]round the tropical areas of Antigua Guatemala , Río Dulce , the Atitlán l[MASK]ke , Semuc Champey and the Tikal ruins ) and dire[MASK]ted by Argentine director Joaquín Cambre . Arjona commented that " this vid[MASK]o recreates the battle on the couple when someone starts to talk ' is the beginning of the end ' " . " Fuiste Tú "[MASK]reached number two on [MASK]he Billboard Top Latin Songs and number one on the Latin Pop Songs charts . 
 " Mi[MASK]Novia Se Me Está Poniendo Vieja [MASK] was released as the third single . Arjona wrote the song for his mother , Noemí Morale[MASK] . The music video for the song , released in April 2012 , was filmed at Universal[MASK]Studios in Los Angele[MASK] . It featur[MASK]s Arjona and his son , Ricardo Arjo[MASK]a Jr . , and was directed by Robert García . The song was used by American tele[MASK]ommunications corporation AT & T for a Nokia Lumia 900 smartphone commercial featuring Ar[MASK]ona and was release[MASK] in music stores in May 2012 . The fourth single from the album , " Te Quiero " , was released in July 2012 . The music video for [MASK]he song was filmed during Arjona 's concerts at Vélez Stadium i[MASK] Buenos Aires , Argentina during his Metamorfo[MASK]is World Tour . It marks Arj[MASK]na 's first music video taken from a live performance . The song reached num[MASK]er ten in Mexico and number one [MASK]n both the Billboard Latin Songs and Latin Pop Songs chart . " Si Tu No Existieras " was relea[MASK]ed in November 2012 as the set 's fifth and final single , and was intended to promote the re @-@ release of the[MASK]album . Th[MASK] song , wh[MASK]ch music video was similar to that of " Te Quiero " ,[MASK]managed to pea[MASK] at number 14 in Mexico .

 Beginning on 27 January 2012 in Toluca , Mexico , Arjona embarked on a world tour to promote the album . The Metamorfosis World Tour [MASK]as [MASK]nnounced in December 2011 , and vi[MASK]ited the Americas . The show consisted of fou[MASK] theatrical sets on a revolving stage ; Arjona performed on e[MASK]ch in turn , as it relateed to each song . Fellow [MASK]uatemalan singer @-@ songwriter Gaby Moreno appeared in several performances , joining [MASK]rjona for[MASK][MASK] Fuiste Tú "[MASK]. The tour was pr[MASK]ised by critics and fans . Natalie Torres of Dia a Dia repo[MASK]ted , " Arjona knows how to handle his ' girls ' [MASK] with a mix of attitudes from a ' rough ' male and[MASK]seductive lyrics " . 
 Jon Pareles of The New Yor[MASK] Times commented that " Arjona is one of Latin pop ’ s finest lyrici[MASK]t[MASK] : observant , nuanced , sometimes wry , sometimes melancholy and especiall[MASK] fond of the play of opposites " . He added , " unlike some of his fellow Latin pop stars , Mr. Arjo[MASK]a is no sac[MASK]harine lover boy " . The tour [MASK]roke records for ticket sales , commercial gross and att[MASK]ndance . In Buenos Aires it was the most popular show at Velez Stadium , with a total attendance of more than 160 @,@ 000 for four consecutive so[MASK]d @-@ out concerts . In Guatemala Ci[MASK]y Arjona was the first [MASK]rtist with two consecutive sold @-@ out concerts at Mateo Flor[MASK]s Stadium , wi[MASK]h a combined attendance of more than 50 @,@ 000 .[MASK]As of October 2012 , th[MASK] tour has been performed for close to one million people in more than eight countries .

 Independiente debuted at the top of the Billboard Top Latin Albums for the week ending 22 October 2011 , and r[MASK]mained at that position the following week . It was the third album by Arjona to remain for more than a week at number one , after Galería Caribe[MASK][MASK] 2000 ) an[MASK] 5to Piso . Independiente became his fourth chart @-@ topper , fol[MASK]owing Poquita Ropa ( 2010 ) . For its third [MASK]eek it fell to number two , replaced by Chino & Nacho 's Supremo[MASK]. The album also d[MASK]buted at number one on t[MASK]e Latin Pop Albums c[MASK]art for the week ending 22 October , becoming [MASK]rjona 's fifth album to do so . It remained at number one the following week ; for its third week ,[MASK]it was replaced by Supremo . The al[MASK][MASK]m reached number one again for the week ending 12 November , and later for the week ending 11 February 2012 . For its[MASK]second run it [MASK]emained three weeks a[MASK] the[MASK]top before be[MASK]n[MASK] replaced by Maná 's Drama y L[MASK]z for a week ; for its th[MASK]rd run at number one , it remained at the top spot for [MASK]ive weeks .[MASK]For the week ending 2 Jun[MASK] 2012 , [MASK]ndependiente returned again to number one . 
 For the week it d[MASK]buted atop both the Latin Albums and Latin Pop Albums charts , Independi[MASK]nte also appeared as number 65 on the Bil[MASK]board 200 . It is Arj[MASK]na 's fifth consecutiv[MASK] album [MASK]o chart on that list ([MASK]following Aden[MASK]ro , Quién Dijo Ay[MASK]r , 5to Piso and Poqu[MASK]ta Ropa ) , although it ha[MASK] only charte[MASK] higher than[MASK]Adentro .

 David Jeffries[MASK]of A[MASK]lmusic gave the album a mildly positive review , citing Arjona 's return to his more mainstre[MASK]m style after the " stripped @-@ down acoustic effort " Poquita Ropa . He compared ( as did Arjona and other critics ) the production values and musical style of [MASK]ndependiente with past albums Animal Nocturno and Historias . Finally , he stated that " Returning fans will revel in this combination of freedom and growth , and app[MASK]eciate the return of producer Tommy Torres , the man who has been behind the boards for quit[MASK] a few of Arjona 's most popular releases " ( referring to Torres ' absence from the production of Poquita Ropa ) . 
 A contributor to the [MASK]olo[MASK]bian websit[MASK] CMI comm[MASK]nted that " listening to Independiente is a[MASK]labyrinth to go through , each song is a huge pa[MASK]h that seems to have no end , because it in[MASK]olves imagination , it invites you to dream , to charm , to bewitch . But neither leaves behind the problematic requireme[MASK]ts of love[MASK], its [MASK]oopholes , hideouts and conce[MASK]ns , as well as its bad time[MASK] in this joke that 's life " . Independiente was nominated at the P[MASK]em[MASK]os J[MASK]ventud of 2012[MASK]for the " Lo Toco Todo[MASK]( I Play It All ) " award . On 25 September 2012 , the album received two nominations at the 13th Annual Latin Grammy Awards : A[MASK]bum [MASK]f the Year and Bes[MASK] Singer @-@ songwriter album . On 3 December 2012 ,[MASK]Indep[MASK]ndiente received a nomination for " Pop Album of the Year " at the 2013 Pre[MASK]ios Lo N[MASK]estro awards . It also received a nomination for Grammy Award for Best Lat[MASK]n Pop A[MASK]bum at the Grammy Awards of 2[MASK]13 . Arjona does not win the latter award since 2[MASK]05 with Adentro in a shared win with Mexican singer Julieta Ve[MASK]egas . In February 201[MASK] , Ind[MASK]pendiente received a nomination for " Latin Pop Album of the Year " at the Billboard Latin Music Awards of 2013 .

 = 2003 Pacific typhoon season = 
[MASK]
 The 2003 Pacific typhoon season was a slightly below a[MASK]erage yearl[MASK]ng period of tropical cyclogenesis exhibiting the development of 31 tropical depressions , of which 21 became named storms ; of those , 1[MASK] became typhoons . Though every [MASK]onth w[MASK]th the exception [MASK]f February and March featured tropical activity [MASK] most storms [MASK]eveloped from May through October . During the season , tropical cyclones affected the Philippines , Ja[MASK]an , China , the Korean Peninsula , Indochina , and various islands in the western Pacifi[MASK] [MASK] 
 The season ran year [MASK]-@ round , with the first storm [MASK] Yanyan , developing west of the Ma[MASK]shall Islands on January 15 . In Ap[MASK]il , Typhoon Kujira bec[MASK]me o[MASK]e of the longest @-@ las[MASK]ing Pacific typhoons [MASK]n history and attained[MASK]climatological records for its unusually early impacts . Typhoon Imbudo in July caused several [MASK]eaths and extensive damage across the Philippines and China . In September , Typhoon Maemi became one of the co[MASK]tliest typhoons in recorded history after striking South Korea ; Mae[MASK]i was also the most[MASK]intense tropical cyclone of the season with a minimum barometric pressure of 910 mbar ( hPa ; 26 @.@ 87 in[MASK]g ) . In late November , Typhoon Lupit devastated areas of Yap State in the Federated States of Micronesia . The season closed with the dissipation of a tropical depression east of the Phili[MASK]pines on December 27 . 
 The scope of this article i[MASK] limited[MASK]to the[MASK]Pacific Ocean , north of the equator and west of the In[MASK]e[MASK]national Date Line . Storms tha[MASK] form east of the date line and north of the equator are called hurricanes ; see 2003 Pacific hurricane season . Tropical Storms for[MASK]ed in the entire west Pacific basin are assigned a name by the Tokyo Typhoon Center . Tropical depressions in this basin monitore[MASK] by the Joint Typhoon Warning Center ( JTWC ) have the " W " suffix added to their nu[MASK]ber . Tr[MASK]pical depressions that enter o[MASK] form in the Philippine area of responsibility are assigned a name by the Philippine Atmospheric , Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration or PAGASA . This can often result in the same storm having two names .

 On March[MASK]5 , 2003 , meteorologists from the University Co[MASK]lege Lond[MASK][MASK][MASK]at the Tropical S[MASK]orm Risk ( TSR ) Consortium issued an extended range fo[MASK]ecast for the typhoon [MASK]eason , noting the likelihood of near ave[MASK]age tropical cyclone activity as a[MASK]result of projected neutral sea surface temperatures . The forecast indicated the po[MASK]ential for 26 @.@ 2 tropical storms , c[MASK]mpared to the 10 – and 30 @-@ year [MASK]verage of 27 @.@ 8 and 26 @.@ 3 storm[MASK] , respectivel[MASK] . The following month , the group rais[MASK]d their fo[MASK]ecast for tropical storms to 26[MASK]@.@ 7 , indicating a slightly above average season . Over next two months , however , fluctuations in sea surface temperatures , particularly those in the Central Pacific , caused the group to revise their predictions down[MASK]ard and indicated the proba[MASK]ility for a slightly below average typhoon season in their June forecast . A rise in sea surface temperatures in the [MASK]ollowing month[MASK] prompted [MASK]he forecasting group to once again raise their f[MASK]recasts to indicate a near @-@ average season in their final August forecast update , which predicted 27 tropical storms . The group wa[MASK] very accurate in their forecasts ,[MASK]with their Ap[MASK]il and August forecasts being the most accurate . 
 Similarly , meteorologists working with the City University of [MASK]ong Kong issued a seasonal projection on April 2[MASK] , 2003 , i[MASK]dicating the [MASK]ikelihood of a normal or below normal season with 29 total tropical cyclones , 26 tropical storms , and 16 typhoons . As with the TSR , the group primarily based their forecast numbers on the prevailing status of the El Niño @-@ Southern Oscillation . The City University of Hong Kong revised their forecasts on June 24 , 2003 , indicating a slight increase of total tropical cyclones to 30 . The group was also accurate[MASK]in their forecasts for the entirety of the Northwest Pacific , though [MASK]heir specialized forecasts for the Sout[MASK] China Sea were substantial[MASK]y off . 
 During the year , the Japan Met[MASK]orological Agency ( JMA ) issued advisories on tropical cyclones west of the International Date Line to the Malay Peninsula , and north of the equator ; this was due to the agency 's s[MASK]atus as the official Regional Specialized Meteorological Center , as designated by the World Meteorological Organization in [MASK]989 . The JMA issued fo[MASK][MASK]casts[MASK]and analyses four times a day , beginning at 0000 UTC and continuing every six hours .[MASK]The JM[MASK] issued forecasts based on a cli[MASK]atological tropica[MASK] cyclone foreca[MASK]t model . The agency estimated 10 minute sus[MASK]ained winds and barometric pressure based on the Dvor[MASK]k[MASK]technique and numerica[MASK] weather prediction . The JTWC also issued warnings on storms within the basin , operating from Pearl Harbor in Hawaii to represent the interests of the United States Armed Forces [MASK]n the [MASK]ndian and Pacific Oceans .

 Throughout the season , sea surface temperatures within th[MASK] western equ[MASK]tori[MASK]l Pacific were a[MASK]ove normal , inclu[MASK]ing those in the South China[MASK]Sea . Areas of convection persisted year @-@ round in the lower latitudes , particularly around the Philippines . Atmospheric divergence was also prevalent in the same [MASK]egions , resul[MASK]ing in enhanced tropical cyclogenesis east of the Philippines in 2003 ; the mean region of development of tropical systems during the y[MASK]ar was more southwest than the 1971 [MASK] 2000 30 @-@ year average . In 2003 , [MASK]he JMA monitored 21 tropical cyclones of at[MASK]least tropical storm[MASK]intensity[MASK]; of those , 14 reached typhoon intensity . Though the n[MASK]mber of tropical storms was below average [MASK] the ratio between tropical storms and typhoons [MASK]as 66 % greater than normal . The Philippine Atmospheri[MASK] , Geophysical and Astronomical Servi[MASK]es Adm[MASK]nistration ( PAGASA ) monitored three additional cyclones of at least tropical storm intensity that were not monitored by the JMA . 
 The season began with the formation of Tropical Storm Yanyan on January 15 . After its dissipation five da[MASK]s later , no trop[MASK]cal cyclones of at least tropical storm intensity[MASK]developed over the next two[MASK]months[MASK]. This period[MASK]of inactivity ended with the formation of Typhoon Kujira in mid @-@ April ; Kujira was[MASK]one of the longest[MASK]lived Pacific storms on record and was the first typhoon[MASK]with 1 @-@ minute sustained winds of at least 240 km / h ( 150 mph ) in April since Typhoon Isa in 1997 . Tropic[MASK]l activity was enha[MASK]ced from May to June , and during this period the JMA[MASK]monitored four tro[MASK]ical storms , while the PAGASA mo[MASK]itored a fifth storm off[MASK]the eastern Philippines . Three of the four tropical storms monitored by the JMA approached or hit Japan , inclu[MASK]ing[MASK]Typhoon Soudelor , which brought heavy rainfall and wind across the Ryukyu I[MASK]lands and the Korean Peninsula . 
 Tropical activity once again declined towards the second half of June and first half of July . The seco[MASK]d half of July , how[MASK]ver , featured the development of typhoons Imbudo and Koni , which both tracked westward across t[MASK]e Philippines before [MASK]triking [MASK]reas near Saipan a[MASK]d other regions[MASK]of southeastern China . Imbudo caused the deaths of 78 people and US $ 383 million in damage .[MASK]August was a highly [MASK]ctive m[MASK]nt[MASK][MASK]for tropical cyclogenesis , with a total of six [MASK]ropical storms monitored by the JMA[MASK], JTWC , and PAGASA . This included typhoons Krovanh and Dujuan , which also struck south[MASK]astern China . Typhoon Etau earlier in the month made landfall in Japan , resultin[MASK] in 17 deaths . 
[MASK]Activity was somewhat below average in September , with only one tropical cyclone making landfall , Maemi . However[MASK], Maemi was the strongest tropical cyclone of [MASK]he season and was the costliest wi[MASK]h roughly US $ 4 @.@ 8 billion in damage , mostly in South Korea . Tropical cyclogenesis and activity continued to decline after A[MASK]gust , with October featur[MASK]ng only three tropical storms . However , two , Ketsana and Parma , reached typhoon intensity ; both stay[MASK]d away from land . November featured less storms but was climatol[MASK]gically average , with two typhoons devel[MASK]p[MASK]ng . The second typhoon , Lupit , devastated portions of Yap State , resulting in approximatel[MASK] $ 1 @.@ 7 million in damage . In December , the JTWC and PAGASA monitored a sole tropical system east of the Philippines , though the JMA did not [MASK]onitor or classi[MASK]y any tropical cyc[MASK]ones during the month .

 In storm information below , wind @-@ speed advisories differ[MASK]from the Joint Typhoon Warning Center ( JTWC ) to the JMA as the JTWC uses the Uni[MASK]ed States criteria of 1 @-@ minute mean [MASK]o designate maximum sustained winds , while the JMA uses the 10 @-@ minute [MASK]ean wind criteria to designate tropical cyclone maximum sustained winds . This difference generally results i[MASK] JTWC maximum winds appea[MASK]ing higher than the maximum winds described by[MASK]the [MASK]MA for the same cyclone[MASK].

 On January 11 , the JTWC began mo[MASK]itoring the disturbance that w[MASK]uld eventu[MASK]lly develop into Yanyan near the International Date Line . As the system tracked [MASK]estward , it gradually move[MASK] [MASK]nto a more favorable environment for tropical cyclogenesis . On Janua[MASK]y 14 , surface observations indicated that the low @-@ pressure area had dev[MASK]loped a closed , low @-@ level circulation center indicative of a tropical cyc[MASK]one , satel[MASK]ite im[MASK]gery remai[MASK]ed inconc[MASK]usive . Nonetheless , the JM[MASK] classifie[MASK] the pre[MASK]sure area as a tropical depression west of the Marshall Is[MASK]ands at 0600 UTC on January 15 . The JTW[MASK] would follow suit by classifying the storm as such at 1800 UTC later that day . At the time , the depression [MASK]as tracking west @-@ northwest under the influence of [MASK] subtropical ridge to t[MASK]e north . [MASK]ver the next day the system waned in convective activity before resuming its previous track and accelerating . At 0000 UTC on January 17 , the JTWC upgraded the system to tropical storm intensity , though the storm remained nameless as the JMA continued to classify it as a tropical de[MASK]ression . 
 Throug[MASK]out January[MASK]17 the tropical storm would again o[MASK]cillate in streng[MASK]h , resulting in a brief downgrade by the JTWC to tropical depression intensity . However , an increase in deep convection resulted in its reclassification as a tropica[MASK] storm at 1800 UTC that day , followed by the JMA upgrading the[MASK]system to tropical storm[MASK]intensity at 1200 UTC on January 18 . As such , the storm received the name Yanyan . At roughly the same t[MASK]me , the tropical cyc[MASK][MASK]ne began to stall east of the Mariana Islands and curve sharply nort[MASK]eastward . Whilst the JTWC indicated[MASK]that Yanyan peaked in strength la[MASK]e on January 18 with 1 @-@ minute sustained winds of 60 km / h ( 37 mph ) [MASK] the JMA cons[MASK]dered the system to have maintained the same intensity thro[MASK]ghout its stint as a tropical storm . Steered by the same near[MASK]y subtropical ridg[MASK] , Yanyan would continue to track towards the northeast into a less favorable tropical cyclone environment . The JMA downgraded Yanyan to tropical depression at 1200 UTC on January 20 before the[MASK]storm transitioned into an extratropical cycl[MASK]ne as its low @-@ level circulation center dec[MASK]upled from the p[MASK]imary mass of convection due to strong wind shear . At 0000 UTC , both the JTWC and JMA discontinued the[MASK]mon[MASK]toring of Yanyan . 
 
 = = = Typhoon Kujira ( Amang ) = = = 
 
 Kujira developed from a broad area of disturbed weather as a tropical depression on April 9 well remove[MASK] from any landmasses . Shortly after development , Kujira quickly intensified in its early stages , and was upgraded to [MASK] tropical storm just two days after cyclogenesis . Strengthening slowed afterwards , though the st[MASK]rm attained typhoon intensity on April 14 . Intensification continued and late on April 15 , Kujira reache[MASK] its p[MASK]a[MASK] intensity with [MASK]inds of 165 [MASK]m / h ( 105 mph ) and a minimum barometric pressure of 930 mbar ( hPa ; 2[MASK] @.@ 46 inHg ) . Following peak intensi[MASK]y , Kujira would begin to track northwes[MASK] and oscillate in strength , cresting an addit[MASK]onal two tim[MASK]s in intensity [MASK] On April 21 , the typhoon was downgraded to tropi[MASK]al storm intensity and began to track erratical[MASK]y for several days east of Taiwan . However , on April 24 , Kujira would resume a nort[MASK]ward track and begin to[MASK]wea[MASK]e[MASK] , and on April 24 was downgraded to tropical depr[MASK]ssi[MASK]n strength as it made landfall on Kyushu . Foll[MASK]wing landfall , Kujira transitioned into an extratropical cyclone on April 25 , which per[MASK]isted until crossin[MASK] the Internation[MASK]l Dateline towards the end of April 2003 . 
 Shortly after developing , Kujira caused two fata[MASK]ities in Pohnpei in addition to minor agricultu[MASK]al and infrastructural damage ; similar effect[MASK] wer[MASK] felt in Guam . Several da[MASK]s later , the typhoon prompted cyclone warni[MASK]gs and other prec[MASK]utionary measu[MASK]es in the Philippines after fore[MASK]asts indicated the potential for[MASK]strong winds and [MASK]ain . However , ul[MASK]imately any effects in the archi[MASK]elago associated with Kujira remained minimal . The typhoon also prompted warning products in Taiwan ,[MASK]making it the first April ty[MASK]hoon since 1978 to cause such a feat . Unlike in the Philippines , however , Kujira would bring significant rainfall [MASK]o Ta[MASK]wan . [MASK]ffects from the[MASK]typhoon were most significant in Japan , particularly in the Ryukyu Islands . Strong winds , rain , and waves caused US $ 230 @,@ 000 ( ¥ 27 @.@ 8 millio[MASK] ) in agricultur[MASK]l damage on Ishi[MASK]aki Island . One person was killed d[MASK]e to injuries resulting from the waves . In Kyushu , heavy rainfall , peaking at 196 mm ( 7 @.@ 7 in ) in Ōita Prefecture , was reported . Overall , despite its distance away from land an[MASK] weak intensity at the time of its sole landfall , Kujira resulted in three fatalities . 
 
 = = = Typhoon Chan @[MASK]@ hom = = = 
 
 Midday on May [MASK]8 , the JTWC began t[MASK] monitor [MASK]n area of persistent disturbed[MASK]weather associated with a broad low @-@ pressure area southwest of Chuuk . Within highly conductive conditions , the di[MASK]turbance quickly organized and became classified as a tropical depression at 0000 UTC the following day . In its initial stages , the depression [MASK]racked slowly northeastwards . However , a shortwave trough forced a weakness in a nearb[MASK] ridge , allowing for the storm to take a more streamlined , n[MASK]rthward[MASK]path . At 1200 UTC on May 20 , the JMA upgraded the depression to Tropical Storm Chan @-@ hom . Following the system 's naming , Chan @-@ hom temporarily meandered towards the northwest before resuming its northeasterly track . The next day , the storm began to deve[MASK]op an eye[MASK]; this was reflected with an upgrade by the JMA to typhoon status at 0600 UTC on May 23 . Gradual inte[MASK]sification followed , and at 1800 UTC that day Chan @-@ hom reached its peak intensity with max[MASK]mum sustained winds of 155 km / h ( 10[MASK] mph ) and a minimum pressure of 9[MASK]0 mbar ( hPa ; 27 @.@ 76 inHg ) . 
 Following peak intensity , Chan @-@ hom began to intake dry ai[MASK] beginning on May 25 . At roughly the same time , the typhoon began to weaken and accelerate towards the northeast . Conditions continued [MASK]o worsen as the storm moved further north , and as t[MASK]e cyclone passed east of Minamitorishima , it was downgraded to tropical storm classification . By this time , C[MASK]an @-@ hom had lost much of its convection d[MASK]e to wind shear . Early on[MASK]May 27 , Chan @-@ hom had fully transition[MASK]d into an ex[MASK]ratropical cyclone , and these re[MASK]na[MASK]ts continued to track towards the northeast[MASK]. These extr[MASK]tropical remnants dissipated south of t[MASK]e Aleutian Islan[MASK]s the following day . Early in the typhoon 's existence , Chan @-@ hom posed a potential threat to Guam , but remained well east of the island . How[MASK]ver , after pass[MASK]ng to the northeast , winds from the typhoon fan[MASK]e[MASK] volcanic ash from the recently erupting Anatahan volcano towards the island , prompti[MASK]g precautionary m[MASK]asures in Guam . Ashfalls wer[MASK] reported on the island , forcing the cancellatio[MASK] [MASK]f seve[MASK]al flights . As a tropical storm , Chan @-[MASK] hom caused some damage to homes [MASK]nd crops on Chuuk , mostly due to heavy rains brought forth by the storm . Offshore , a 1 @,@ 04[MASK] ton fishing vessel , the Nien Feioch , sank during the storm [MASK] The ship was valued at $ 16 million . 
 
 =[MASK]= = Severe Tropical Storm Linfa ( Chedeng ) = = = 
 
 Tropical Storm Linfa developed as a tropical depression just off the western coast of Luzon on May 25 . The disturbance quickly intensified to reach tropical storm intensity a few hours after cyclogenesis . However , intensification leveled off as Lin[MASK]a exe[MASK]ute[MASK] a small clockwise loop before a subsequent landfall on Luzon on May 27 . Due to l[MASK]nd interaction the storm temporarily weakened and decoupled be[MASK]ore reforming in the [MASK]hilippine Sea . Afterwards Linfa began reintensify[MASK]ng a[MASK]d reached its peak intensity on May 29 with maximum s[MASK]stained winds [MASK][MASK] 100 km / h ( 65 mph ) and a barometric pressure of 980 mbar ( hPa ; 28 @.@ 94 inHg ) . Followi[MASK]g its pea[MASK] the tropical storm began to det[MASK]riorate and transitioned into an extratropical cyclone on May 30 ; these extratropical remnants continued to track northward through Japan befo[MASK]e diss[MASK]pating in the Sea of Okhotsk on June 4 . 
 The erratic and slow movement of Linfa off the western Philippines was the catalyst for extreme rainfall and flooding , killing 41 persons in the archipelago . Precipitation peaked at 723 mm ( 28 @.@ 5 in ) near Dagupan . Rising floodwaters[MASK]resulted in the temporary shutdo[MASK]n of government offices and numerous mudslides . In addition , strong winds caused widespread [MASK]ower outages . Overall damage from Linfa in the Philippine[MASK] amounted to ₱[MASK]192 @.@ 3 million ( US $ 3 @.@ 65 million ) . The floods also displaced 8 @,@ 367 p[MASK]ople in 1 @,@ 686 families and destroyed 178 homes . Linfa and its extratropical rem[MASK]ants later brought torrential rainfall and widespread flooding to Japan , particularly in southwestern regions . Rainfall there peaked [MASK]t 727 mm ( 28 @.@ 62 in )[MASK]. Flood damage was worst in Kōchi and Tokushima Prefectures , where several buildings were dest[MASK]oyed by floodwater . Other locations in Jap[MASK]n expe[MASK]ie[MASK]ced considerable agricultural damage as well as numerous landslides .[MASK]Overall , Linfa caused rough[MASK]y $ 28[MASK]@.@ 2 million in damage , much of wh[MASK]ch occurred in Japan [MASK] though the entirety of deaths associated with the cyclone took place in the Philippines . 
 
 = = = Severe Tropical Storm Nang[MASK]a ( Dodong[MASK]) = = = 
 
 In late May , an area of d[MASK]stur[MASK]ed weather be[MASK]an to persist in the South China Sea . The JTWC began to monitor the storm cluster on May 29 . The following d[MASK]y , the JMA reclassified the system as a tropical depression ; initially the system remained highly disorganized due to the lack o[MASK] deep convection . Persistent moderate wind shear and dry air [MASK]revented [MASK]he cyclone from strengthening sig[MASK]i[MASK]icantly in the storm 's early stages . These conditions abated as the dep[MASK]ession tracked northeast , an[MASK] at 0[MASK]00 UTC on June 1 , the JMA [MASK]pgrade[MASK] the system to Tropical Storm Nangka . Throughout the course of [MASK]he day , Nangka continued to strengthen as it accelerated northeast , and peaked in strength with a barometric pressure of 985 mbar ( hPa ; 29 @.[MASK] 09 inHg ) and maxim[MASK]m sustained winds of 95 km / h [MASK] 6[MASK] mph ) , making it a severe tropical storm . 
 However , upon moving through the Bashi Channel , conditions began to deteriorate due to increased wind shear , weakening the system and resultin[MASK] in its downgra[MASK]e to tr[MASK]pical depression status by the JMA at 1200 UTC on June 3 . Nangka continued to becom[MASK] increasingly disorganized as it moved further north , and late that day , the depression[MASK]transitioned to an extratropical cyclone . The resulting remnants continued to track well east of Japan before dissipating on June 7 . Due to its track away from landmasses , damage remained minimal ; however , as Nangka passed to the south and east of Japan , the storm brought light rainfall to the country [MASK] peaking [MASK]t 81 mm ( 3 @.@ 2 in ) in Minamidaitō , Okinawa . 
 
 = = = Typhoon Soudelor ( Egay ) = = = 
 
 A tropical disturbance persisted in the monsoon trou[MASK]h northwest of Pohnpei on June 7 , and moved westward without d[MASK]velopment due to wind shear . On June 11 , the shear decreased enough to allow the conv[MASK]ction[MASK]to organiz[MASK] , and the next day the JMA classified it as a tropical depression northeast of Palau . On June 13 , the JMA upgraded it to Tropical Storm Soudelor to the east of the Philippines , and PAGASA gave it the local name " Egay " . Soudelor moved to the northwest and later to [MASK]he nor[MASK]h , parallel to[MASK]the east[MASK]rn P[MASK]ili[MASK]pines , [MASK]nd on June 17 , the[MASK]JMA upgraded[MASK][MASK]t to typhoon status . The storm rapidly intensified to the east of Taiwan as it developed a well @-@ define[MASK] eye , and while doing so passed over the Japanese [MASK]sland of Iriomote @-@ jima at around 2030 UTC on June 17 . At 0600 UTC on June 18 , the JTWC e[MASK]timated peak 1 minute winds of 215 km / h ( 135 mph ) , while the J[MASK]A estimated peak 10 minute wi[MASK]ds [MASK]f 150 km / h ( 90 mph ) . Increased s[MASK]ear weakened the typ[MASK]oon to tropical storm strengthen[MASK]on June 19 , and later that day the JMA declared the storm as extratropical near the Oki Islands . T[MASK]e extratropical remnants of Soudelor continued to the nort[MASK]east , crossing north[MASK]rn Jap[MASK]n on June 20 and dissipating on June 24 .

 = = = Typhoon Imbudo ( Harurot ) = = = 
 
 On July 15 , [MASK]he JMA estima[MASK]ed that a tropical depression formed , and the next day the JTWC initiated advisories on Tropical Depression 09W about 6[MASK]5 km ( 415 mi ) east of Yap . A subtropical ridge near Okinawa steered the nascent [MASK]epression to the west @-@ northwest for much of its duration [MASK] With warm waters and favorable upper @-@ level conditions , the depression quickly organized[MASK], first to Tropical Storm Imbudo on July [MASK]7 , and to typhoon status[MASK]two days later , when PAG[MASK]SA begin issuing advisories on Typhoon Harurot . Around that time , Im[MASK]udo was rapidl[MASK] i[MASK]tensifying , developing a well @-@ defined eye . At 1200 UTC[MASK]on July 20 , the JMA estimated peak 10 minute sustained winds of 165 km / h ( 105 mph ) , [MASK]nd the same time ,[MASK]the JTWC estimated 1 minute sustained winds of 240 km / h ( [MASK]50 mph ) [MASK] making it a super typhoon . Imbudo maintained peak winds for about 1[MASK] hours , before undergoing an e[MASK]ewall replacement cycle . At 0300 UTC on[MASK]July 22 , Imbudo struck northern Luzon , wit[MASK] [MASK] minute winds estimat[MASK]d at 205 km / h ( 125 mph ) by the [MASK]TWC . It weakened over land , but re @-@ intensified in the South [MASK]hina Sea , striking southern China near Yangjiang , Guangdong on July 24 . Imbudo rapidly weakened , dissipating on July 25 .

 = = = Se[MASK]ere Tropical Storm Koni ( Gilas ) = = [MASK] 
 
 Koni originated from a tropical depression situated within the monsoon tro[MASK]gh to the east of the Philippines on July 15 . Tracking[MASK]westward , intensification was slow and the system remained a tropical depression as it moved[MASK]across the central Philippines on July 17 . Upon moving into the South China Sea , conditions allowed for quicker strengthening , and the cyclone reach[MASK]d tropical storm status on July 18 b[MASK]fore reaching its peak intensity with m[MASK]ximum sustained winds of 110 km / h ( 70 mph ) , making it a severe tropical storm . However , atmosphe[MASK]ic conditions began to deter[MASK]orate as Koni made landfall on Hainan on July 21 , [MASK]eakening[MASK]the system . The tropical storm continued to weaken as it moved over the Gulf of Tonkin p[MASK]ior to a final landfall near Hanoi , Viet[MASK]am the following [MASK][MASK]y . Tracking inland , the combi[MASK]ation o[MASK] [MASK]and in[MASK]eraction and wind shear caused Koni t[MASK] dissipate over [MASK]aos on July 23 . 
 Shortly after development , Koni tracked through[MASK]the Phil[MASK]ppines , killing two people . After moving into the South Chin[MASK] Sea , turbul[MASK]nce produced by the storm resulted in an aviation[MASK]incident involving a commercial airliner off the western Philippines . Three of the plane 's occupants received minor injuries . In Hainan , Koni c[MASK]used heavy rainfall ,[MASK]peaking at 189 mm ( 7 @.@ 44 in )[MASK]at a st[MASK]tion on Wuzhi Mountain . The rains resulted in th[MASK] collapse of 1 @,@ 400 homes and an estimated CN ¥ 140 @.@ 27 million ( US $ 16 @.@ 9 million ) in direct economic losses . Effects were worst in Vietnam , where three people were killed .

 = = = Tropical Storm [MASK]orakot ( Juaning ) = = = 
 
 Morakot spawn[MASK]d from an area of disturbed weather in the Philippine [MASK]ea on July 31 . Tracking northwest , favorable conditions allowed for the intensification of the system to tropical [MASK]torm strength on August 2 . Morakot reached peak intensity later that day with winds of 85 km / h ( 50 mph [MASK] and a minimum barometric pressure of 992 mbar ( hPa ; 28 @.@ 29 inHg ) . This [MASK]ntensity was held for several hours until less conducive atmospheric [MASK]onditions slightly we[MASK]kened the system ; this was followed by Morakot making landfal[MASK] on southern Taiwan on[MASK]August 3 . Subsequently , the stor[MASK][MASK]weakened and moved int[MASK] the Taiwan Strait before[MASK]making its final l[MASK]ndfall near Quanzhou , China the next day . The storm quickly weakened over the Chinese [MASK]ainland [MASK] and dissi[MASK]ated entirely several hours after landfall . 
 In Taiwan , where Morako[MASK] first made landfall , heavy rainfall res[MASK]lted in flooding[MASK].

Precipitation there [MASK]eaked[MASK]at 653 mm ( 25 @.@ 71 in ) over a period of nearly two days in Taitung County . Crop damage also resulted from the rainfall , and was estimated at ov[MASK]r NT $ 70 million ( US $ 2 million ) . In Ch[MASK][MASK]a , record rainfall was repo[MASK]ted . The worst impacte[MASK] city was Quanzhou , where losses due to Morakot reached CN ¥ 240 million ([MASK]US $ 29 million ) and one death was reported . Power outages were also widespread across southeastern China . Due to preexisting drought conditions , 703 cloud seeding operatio[MASK]s took place in order to artificially generate added rainfall ; such operations resulted in moderate precipitation over the targeted area [MASK] Overall , Morakot caused roughly $ 31 million in damage and thr[MASK]e deaths .

 Krovanh originated from[MASK]a tropical disturbance within the monsoon tro[MASK]gh east of Chuuk State on A[MASK]gust[MASK]13 . Despite rather favorable conditions , the initial tropical depression did not intensify significantly and degenerated into a remnant low on August 18 . However , these remnants were able to[MASK]reorganize and the system was reclassified as [MASK] t[MASK]opical cyclone a day later[MASK]. Intensifi[MASK]atio[MASK] was rather rapid upon the storm 's reformation – the depression reached tropical storm status on August 20 and then typhoon intensity two days later . Shortly after , Krovanh made landfall on Luzon at peak intensity with winds of 120 km / h ( 75 mph ) . The typhoon eme[MASK]ged into the South China Sea as a much weaker tropical storm , though it was able to restrengthen over warm waters . Onc[MASK] again at typhoon intensity ,[MASK]Krovanh clipped Hainan before moving over the Leizhou Peninsula on its way to a final landfall ne[MASK]r Cẩm Phả , Vietnam on August 25 .

 The monsoon trough spawned several tropical disturba[MASK]ces in the middle of August , one of which became Tropical De[MASK]ression Lakay near the Philippines . On August 18 [MASK] an area of convect[MASK]on persisted [MASK]n the souther[MASK] side of a circulation , developing into a tropical depression east of Luzon . It moved quickly northward and later[MASK]to the northwest in an area g[MASK]nerally unfavorable for strengthening , such as the presence of wind shear and land interaction [MASK] On August 19 , the JMA upgraded the depression to Tropical Storm Vamco to th[MASK] east of Ta[MASK]wan . Later that day , the circulation p[MASK]ssed just 55 km ( 35 mi ) north of Taipei , although the convection was exposed that time . On August 20 , the JMA assessed Vamco as dissipating in the Taiwan Strait , although the JTWC continued advisories until the storm moved ashore in southeastern China . [MASK] Rainfal[MASK] in Taiwan reached 69 mm ( 2 @.@ 7 in ) in Ilan County . On the island , the storm left several hundred houses withou[MASK] power due to a lightning strike .

On August [MASK]9 , the JMA upgraded it to Tropical Storm Dujuan [MASK] and that [MASK]ay PAGASA began issuing [MASK]dvisories on Tropical [MASK]torm Onyok . The storm quickly intensified in[MASK]o a typhoon , after developing an[MASK]eye in the[MASK]center . On September 1 , the JMA estimated Dujuan attained pe[MASK]k 10 minute winds of 150 km / h ( 90 mph ) , and the JTWC assessed peak[MASK]1 – minute winds of 230 km / h ( 145 mph ) . While near peak intensity , the center of Dujuan passed abo[MASK]t 45 k[MASK] ( 30 mi ) south of the southern tip of Taiwan . The typhoon weakened steadily and was a severe tropical storm by the time it made landfall on Septembe[MASK] 2 just east of Hong Kong . The JTWC estimated[MASK]landfall winds of 185 km / h ( 115 mph ) , making it the strongest typhoon to strik[MASK] t[MASK]e Pearl[MASK]River Delta since Typh[MASK]on Hope in 1979 .

 In the middle of September , the monsoon tro[MASK]gh spawned a rapidly organizing disturbance east @-@ northeast of Luzon , with weak wind shear and favorable conditions . On Septemb[MASK]r 16 , the JMA classified it as a tropical depression , and the JTWC initiated advisories the next day .

On September 18 , the JMA upgraded the depression to Tropical Storm Choi @-@ wan , the same day that PAGASA classified it as Tropical Storm Roskas . An e[MASK]stward @-@ moving trough turned the storm to[MASK]the northeast , bringing the track over Okinawa and Amami Ōshima on September 19 . Choi @-@ wan continued gr[MASK]dually intensifying , becoming a[MASK]typhoon on September 20 to the southeast of Japan . That day , the JMA estimated peak winds of 130 km / h ( 80 m[MASK]h ) , and the JTWC estimat[MASK]d peak 1 minute winds of 185 km / h ( 115 mph ) on September 21 , after Choi @-@ wan developed a well @-@ defined eye .

 Towards the end of Septembe[MASK] , the [MASK]onsoo[MASK] trough spawned a tropical disturbance east @-@ no[MASK]thea[MASK]t of [MASK]ap , which became a[MASK]tropical depression on September 24 . There were initially several circulations , with a tropical upper[MASK]tropospheric trough to the northeast increasing outflow . After slowing and turning to the northeast , the depression intensified into Tropical Storm Koppu on September 26 . After the storm developed a large eye feature , the JTWC upgraded it[MASK]to typhoon stat[MASK]s on September 27 , although th[MASK] JMA did not f[MASK]llow suit until the following day[MASK]while near Chichi @-@ [MASK]ima . Also that day , Koppu passed 95 km ( 60 mi ) west of Iwo Jima , and the JMA estimated peak 10 minute winds of 130 km / h ( 80 mph ) . The JTWC estimated peak[MASK]1 minute winds of 165 km / h ( 105 mph ) , before an approaching trough caused the typhoon to accelerate northe[MASK]stward . T[MASK]e convection diminished near the center , causing Koppu to[MASK]become extratropical on September 30 . The remnants continued generally northeastward through the Al[MASK]utian Islands , eventually passing south of ma[MASK]nland Alaska on October 7 . 
 On Chichi @-@ jima , Ty[MASK]hoon Kop[MASK]u produced sustained winds of 102 km / h ( 63 mph ) , with gus[MASK]s to 200 km / h ( 124 mph ) , which[MASK]was the third strongest on record for the station .

 In the middle of October , an area of convection persisted along the monsoon trough between Lu[MASK]on and Guam ,[MASK]developing into a tropical depression on October 17 . The same monsoon trough later spawned Typhoon Parma to the east . For several days , the system remained di[MASK]organized while dr[MASK]ftin[MASK] to the west @-@ northwest due to weak steering currents south of the[MASK]subtropical ridge . On October 19 , the JMA upgraded the depression to Tropical Storm Ketsana , a[MASK]d by that time the s[MASK]orm had begun drifting to the northeast . With favorable outflow , Ketsana quickly intensifie[MASK] into a typhoon on October 20 after developing an eye[MASK], and two days later , the JMA estimated peak winds of 165 km / h ( 105 mph ) .[MASK]The JTWC estimated peak 1 minute winds of 230 km / h ( 145 mph ) around the time the well @-@ defined eye had expanded to 37 km ( 23 mi ) .

 The same monsoon trough that spawned Ty[MASK]hoon Koppu also pro[MASK]uced an area of convection[MASK]to the north @-@ northe[MASK]st of Guam , becoming a [MASK]ropical depression [MASK]n October 19 . The system m[MASK]ved northwestward and later turned to the northe[MASK]st around the subtro[MASK]ical ridge . Wit[MASK] low wind shear and favorable outflow , the convection became better organized , and the JMA upgraded it to Tropical S[MASK]orm Parma on October 21 . A[MASK]ter an eye began to form , Parma was upgraded to typhoon status the next day . An approaching trough c[MASK]used Parma to accelerate nor[MASK]heastward while also inc[MASK]easing outflow . On[MASK]October 24 , the JMA estima[MASK]ed peak winds o[MASK][MASK]175 km / h ( [MASK]10 mph ) while the J[MASK]WC estimated winds of 240 km / h ( 150 mph ) , an unusually high intensity for 30 ° N.

 Increasing wind shear [MASK]eakened the convection , and Pa[MASK]ma d[MASK]teriorated [MASK][MASK]to a severe tropical storm on October 26 . The next day , it began moving westward while passing about 345 km ( 215 mi ) north of Wake Island . A large eye of 110 km ( 70 mi ) in diameter developed , and on October 28 , the JMA re @-[MASK] upgraded Pa[MASK]ma to typhoon status .

 An area of convection formed on May[MASK]16 to the southwest of Palau , located within an area of weak wind shear . The next day , the JMA and the JTWC both classified the system as a tropical depression . The convectio[MASK] was disorganized in association with multiple circu[MASK]ation ce[MASK]ters , al[MASK][MASK]ough it gradually organ[MASK]zed . Moving[MASK]westward initially , [MASK]he depression tu[MASK]ned more to the north into an area of increasin[MASK] wind shear[MASK]. On May 19 , the JTWC upgraded the system to Tropical Storm [MASK]3[MASK] , and on the same [MASK]ay , PAGAS[MASK] clas[MASK]ified it as Tropical Depression Batibot[MASK]. Soon after , the convection decreased from the center , and by May 20 , all warning agencies had disconti[MASK]ued advisories . 
 On July 9 , PAGASA classified a system as Tropical Depression Falcon , off th[MASK] west coast of the Philippines . The JMA also brie[MASK]ly initiated adviso[MASK]ies before dro[MASK]ping them later on July 9 . Later in[MASK]the month , PAGASA briefly issued advisories[MASK]on Tropical De[MASK]ression Ineng on July 30 off the east coast of Mindanao . The depression dissipated the next day , causing about P8 million ( PHP , $ 145 @,@ 000 USD ) in damage . The monsoon trough spawned a tropical depression north of Luzon on August 18 , with PAGASA namin[MASK] it Lakay . There were several cir[MASK]ulation[MASK] in the region , with Tr[MASK]pical Storm Vamco to the n[MASK]rtheas[MASK] ne[MASK]r Taiwan , and the overall system moved generally westward .[MASK]PAGASA briefly classified Lakay as a trop[MASK]cal storm on Au[MASK]ust 19 before ending advisories the next day .

 On September 5 , former Hurricane Jimena crossed the International Date Line into[MASK]th[MASK] basin .[MASK]By that time , the[MASK]circulation[MASK]was largely exposed from the convection , and the center quickly dissipated . Later in the month , the monsoon trough spawned a disturbance east of the Philippines that PAGASA classified as Tropical Depression Quiel on Sep[MASK]ember 15 . The system moved westward but never intensified , dissipating west of Luzon on September 19 . The broad system also[MASK]spawned Typhoon Choi @-@ wan . 
 I[MASK] October , the JTWC classif[MASK]ed Tropical Depr[MASK]ssion 1[MASK]W early i[MASK] the[MASK]month off the west coast of Luzon . With weak steering currents , the system moved slowly southwestward befo[MASK]e lo[MASK]ping to the nort[MASK]west . On October 10 , the depression dissipated just off the coast of southern China . On October 5 , the JMA monitored a tropical depression southeast of Taiwan that later passed near the island , producing heavy rainfall that peaked at 153 mm ( 6 @.@ 0 in ) in Ilan County . A few days later , the JTWC monitored [MASK]ropical Depression 19W , which developed on October 12 after an extratropical storm pr[MASK]duced an area of convection . Desc[MASK]ibed as a subtropical [MASK]ow ,[MASK]the depression moved generally northeastward toward Japan due to an approaching cold front .[MASK]The depression moved through Kyushu and Honshu before dissipating on October 13 .

 = Oxaziridine = 
 
 An oxaziridine is an organic molecu[MASK]e that features a three @-@ membered heterocycle containing oxygen , nitro[MASK]en ,[MASK]and carbon . In their largest [MASK]p[MASK]lication , oxazidines are intermediates in the industrial production of hydrazine . Oxaziridine deriva[MASK]ives are also used as specialized reagents in organic chemistry for a variety of o[MASK]idations , including alpha hydroxyla[MASK]ion of enolates , epoxidati[MASK][MASK] and aziridination of olefins , and other heteroatom transfer reactions . Oxaziridines also serve a[MASK] precursors to amides and participate in [ 3 + 2 ] cycloadditions with various heterocumulenes [MASK]o form substituted five @-@ membered heterocycles . Chiral oxaziridine derivatives effect asymmetric oxygen transfer to prochiral enolates as well as ot[MASK]er substrates . Some oxaziridines also [MASK]ave t[MASK]e property of a high barrier to inversion of the nitrogen , allowing for the possi[MASK]ility of chiral[MASK]ty at the nitrogen center . 
 
 = = History = = 
 
 Oxaziridine derivatives were first reported in the mid @-@ 1950s by Emmons and subsequently by Krimm and Horner and Jürgens . Whereas oxygen and nitrogen typically [MASK]ct as nucl[MASK]ophiles due to their high electronegativity , oxaz[MASK]ridines allow for electrophilic transfer of both h[MASK]teroatoms . This unusual reactivity is due to [MASK]he presence of the highly strained three membered ring and t[MASK]e relatively weak N @-@ O bond . Nucleophiles [MASK]end to attack [MASK]t the aziridine nitrogen when the nitrogen substituent is small ( R1 = H ) ,[MASK]and at the oxygen atom when the nitrogen substituent has greater steri[MASK] bulk . The unusual electronics of the oxaziridine system may be exploited to perform a n[MASK]mber of oxygen and nitrogen transfer reactions including , but not limited to : α @-@ hydroxylation of enolates , epoxidation of [MASK]lkenes , selective oxidation [MASK]f sulfides and selenides , amination of [MASK] @-@ nucleophiles and [MASK] @-@ acylamidation . 
 The Peroxide process for the industrial production o[MASK] hydrazine through[MASK]the oxidation of ammonia with hydrogen peroxide in the presence of ketones was developed in the early 1[MASK]70s . 
 Chiral camphorsulfonyloxaziridines proved useful in the s[MASK]ntheses of complex natural product , such as t[MASK]xol which is marketed[MASK]as a chemotherapy ag[MASK]nt . Both the Holton Taxol total synthesis and the Wender Taxol total[MASK]synthesis feature asymmetric α @-@ hydroxylatio[MASK] with camphorsulfonyloxaziridine .

 Additional[MASK]y , oxidation of chiral imines and oxidation of imines with chiral peracids may yield enantiopure oxaziridines . Some oxaziridines have the unique property of configurationally stable nitrogen atoms at room temperature due to an inversion barrier of 24 to 31 kcal / mol . Enantiopure oxaziridines where stereochemistry is entirely due to configurationally stable nitrogen are reported .

 Oxaziridines are intermediates in the Peroxide process for the production of hydrazine . Many mil[MASK]i[MASK]ns of[MASK]kilograms of hydrazine are produced annually by this method that involves a step wherein ammonia is oxidized in the presence of methyl ethyl ketone to give the oxaziridine : 
 Me ( Et ) C = O + NH3 + H2O2 → Me ( Et ) CONH + H2O

One advantage of using N @-@ sulfonyloxaziridines is that higher chiral induction is almost invari[MASK]bly obse[MASK]ved relative to MoOPH and other oxidants . High yield ( 77 @-@ 91 % ) and dr ( 95 : 5 - 99 : 1 ) are re[MASK]orted for[MASK]α @-@ hydroxylatio[MASK] with the Eva[MASK]s ' chiral auxiliary[MASK]with N @-@ sulfonyloxaziridine as the elec[MASK]rophile . Chiral induction has been demonstrated with[MASK]many other chiral ketones and ketones with chiral auxili[MASK]ries , including[MASK]SAMP[MASK]and RAMP[MASK]. 
 Extensive work has been r[MASK]ported on asymmetric hydroxylation of proch[MASK]ral enolates with camphorsulfonyloxazir[MASK]dine derivativ[MASK][MASK] , achieving moderate to high enantiomeric excess . The commonly accepted proposed transition state that justifies this st[MASK]reochemical outcome involves an open transition state where the steric bulk of R1 det[MASK]rmines the face of approach . 
 The selecti[MASK]ity of some hydroxylations may[MASK]be drastically improved in some cases with the addition of coordinating groups alpha to the oxaziridine ring as oxaziridines 3b and 3c in the table above . In these instances it is proposed that the reaction proceeds through a closed transition state where the metal oxyanion is stabi[MASK]ized by chelation from the sulfate and coordinating groups on the camphor skeleton . 
 α @-@ Hydroxylation with oxaziridines has been widely implemented in total synthesis . It is a key step in both the H[MASK]lton Taxol total synthesis and the Wender Taxol total synthesis . Additionally , Forsyth implemented the transformation in his [MASK]ynthesis [MASK]f the C3 @-@ C14 ( Substituted 1 @,@ 7 @-@ Diox[MASK]spiro [ 5 @.@ 5 ] undec @-@ 3 @-@ ene ) System of Okadaic acid .

 Epoxidation of alkenes is a common reaction because epoxides [MASK]an be derivatized in a [MASK]umber of useful ways . Classically ,[MASK]laboratory epoxidation is carried out with m[MASK][MASK]BA or other peracids . Ox[MASK]ziridines have be[MASK]n found [MASK]o be us[MASK]ful for the formation of highly acid se[MASK]sitive epoxides . ( − ) -Chaetominine[MASK]was synthesized via oxaziridine epoxidation as a late stage transformati[MASK]n as seen below . 
 Another transformation of high synthet[MASK]c utility is asymm[MASK]tric epoxidation . A number of asymmetric epoxid[MASK]tions exist : the Sharpless epoxidation , the Jacobsen @-@ Katsuki e[MASK]oxidation , and the Juliá @-@ Colonna E[MASK]oxidation . These methods require specific functionality in order to achieve sel[MASK]ctivity . The Sharpless epoxidation is specific to allylic alcohol[MASK] , the Jacobsen[MASK]epoxidation requires [MASK]is @-@ disubstituted aryl alkenes , and th[MASK] Juliá epo[MASK]idation requi[MASK]es α @-@ β unsaturated keton[MASK]s . Chiral oxaziridines act stereospecifically on many u[MASK]functionalized alkenes . It has eve[MASK] possible to[MASK]effect stereospecific epoxidation catalytically in the oxazir[MASK]dine chiral unit . Further investigation into these react[MASK]ons may be required before levels of enantiometi[MASK] excess become practical for larg[MASK] scale synthesis .[MASK]Lusinichi et al. have investigated asymmetric epoxidation with a chiral oxaziridinium s[MASK]lt using oxone as the stoichiometric oxidant seen below .

 Perfluorinated oxa[MASK]iri[MASK]ines are known to hydro[MASK]ylate unactivated hydrocarbons with remarkable regio , and diastereospecificity . This is[MASK]a highly coveted transformation , and similar reactivity [MASK]nd specificity is seldom rivaled , especially considering the nonmetallic nature of the oxida[MASK]t . Perfluorin[MASK]ted oxaziridines show high selectivity toward tertiary hydrog[MASK]ns . Hydroxylation of p[MASK]imary carbons and dihydroxylation of a compound with two oxidizable sites have never been observed . Retention of stereochemistry is very high , often 95 - 98 % . ( retenton of stereochemistry may be further enhanced by the addition of a fluoride salt ) .

 Amination of nucleophiles with N @-@ unsubstituted oxazirid[MASK]nes is quite versatile in the breadth of po[MASK]sible nucleophile[MASK] and corresponding products .

 The transfer of acylated amines is more difficult [MASK]han that of unsu[MASK]stituted a[MASK]ines , altho[MASK]gh , unlike amine transfer by oxaziridines , there are no alternat[MASK]ve methods that directly transfer acylated amines . Acylamine transfer has primarily been performed using amines and hydrazines[MASK]as nucleophiles . Very few transfers of acylated nitrogens to carbon nucleophiles [MASK]ave been [MASK]uccessfully performe[MASK] , although some do exist in the literature . 
 
 = = = Rearrangements = = = 
 
 Oxazi[MASK]idines have been[MASK]found to undergo rearrangement reactions via a radical mechanism when irradiated with UV light or in the presence of a single electron transfer reagent such as CuI. spirocylic oxaziridines[MASK]undergo ring expansions to the correspondin[MASK] lactam . Interesti[MASK]gly , the migrating substituent is determined by a stereoelectronic effect where the group trans to the lone pair on [MASK]he nitrogen will always be the pre[MASK]ominant migration product . In light of this effect , it is possible to take advantage of the chiral nitrogen[MASK]due to high inversion [MASK]arrier to direct the rearrangement . This phenomenon is demonstrated by observed sele[MASK]tivities [MASK]n the rearrangements below . In the r[MASK][MASK]rrangement on th[MASK] left the thermodynamically[MASK]unfavor[MASK]ble product is observed exclusively , while in the reaction on [MASK]he right the product derived from the less[MASK]stable radical intermediat[MASK] is favored [MASK] 
 Aubé takes advantage of this rearrangement as the key step in his synthesis of ( + ) -yohimbine , a natural medicine classified by the NIH as possibly effective in the treatment of erectile dysfunction and the sexual problems cause[MASK] by selective serotonin [MASK]euptake inhibitors . 
 It is also notable that oxazirid[MASK]nes[MASK]will thermally [MASK][MASK]arrange to nitrones . Cis @-@ tran[MASK] selectivity of the resulting nitrone is poor , however , yields are goo[MASK] to excellent .

 The Battle of Dürenstein ( al[MASK]o known as the Battle of Dürrenstein [MASK] Battle of Dürnstein and Battle of Diernstein ; German : Gefecht bei Dürrenstein ) , on[MASK]11 November 1805 was an engagement[MASK]in the Napoleonic Wars dur[MASK][MASK]g th[MASK] War of the [MASK]hird Coalition . Dürenstein ( modern Dürnstein )[MASK]is l[MASK]cated in the Wachau Valley , on the River Danube , 73 kilometers ( 45 mi ) upstream from Vienna , Austria . The river makes a crescent @-@ shaped curve between Dürnstein and nearby Krems an der Donau and [MASK]he battle was fought [MASK]n the flood plain between the river[MASK]and the mountains . 
 At Dürenstein a combined f[MASK]rce of Russian and Austrian troops trapped a French division commanded by Théodore Maxime Gazan . The Fren[MASK]h division was [MASK]art of the newly created VIII Corps , the so @-@ called Corps Mortier , under command of Édouard Mortier . In pursuing the Austrian[MASK]re[MASK]reat fr[MASK]m Bavaria , Mort[MASK]er had over @-@ extended his three divisions along the north bank of the Danube . Mikhail Illarionovich K[MASK]tuzov , commander of the Coalition force , enticed Mortier to send Gazan 's division into a trap and French troops were caught in a valley between two Rus[MASK]ian columns . They were resc[MASK]ed by the timely arrival of a second division , under command of Pierre Dupont de l 'Étang . The battle extended well into the night . Both sides claimed victory . Th[MASK] French lost more than[MASK]a third of their parti[MASK]ipants , and Gazan 's d[MASK]vision experienced over 40 pe[MASK]cent losses . The Austrians and Russians also had heavy[MASK]losses--close to 16 perc[MASK]nt--but perhaps the[MASK]most significant was the[MASK]death in action of Johann Heinrich von Schmitt , one of Austria 's most capable chiefs of staff . 
 The battl[MASK] was fought t[MASK]ree weeks after the Austrian capitulation at Ulm and three weeks before the Russo @-@ Austrian defeat at the Battle of Austerlitz . After [MASK]usterlitz Austria withdrew from the war .[MASK]The French demanded a high indemnity and Francis II abdi[MASK]ated as Holy Roman Emperor , releasing the German states from their allegiance to the [MASK]oly [MASK][MASK]man Empire .

 In a serie[MASK] of conflicts from 1803 @-@ 15 [MASK]nown as the Napoleonic Wars , v[MASK]rious [MASK]uropean powers formed five coalitio[MASK]s against the First French Empire . Like the wars sparked by the French Revolution ( 1789 ) [MASK] these further revolutionized the formation , organization and training of European armies and led to a[MASK] unprecedent[MASK]d militarization ,[MASK]mainly d[MASK]e to mass conscripti[MASK]n . Under the leadership of Napoleon , French power rose qu[MASK]ckly as the Grande Armée conquered most of Europe , and collapsed rap[MASK]dly after the disastrous invasion of Russia in 1812 . Napoleon 's empi[MASK]e ultimately suffered complete military defeat [MASK]n the 1813 – 14 campaigns , resulting in the restoration of the Bourbon monarchy in France . Although Napoleon made a spec[MASK]acular return in 1815 [MASK] known as the Hundred Days , his defeat at the Battle of Waterloo , the pursuit of his army and himself , his abdication and bani[MASK]hment to the Island of Saint Helena concluded the Napoleonic Wars .

 From 1803 @-@ 06 the Third Coalition [MASK]ought the First French Empire and its client states ( see table at right ) . Alth[MASK]ugh several nav[MASK]l b[MASK]ttles determined control of the seas , the outcome of the war was decided on the continent , pre[MASK]ominantly in two major land operations in the Danube[MASK]valley : the Ulm campaign in the upper Danube and the Vienna campaign , in the middl[MASK][MASK]Danube valley . 
 Political conflicts i[MASK] Vienna delayed Austria 's entry into the Third Coalition until[MASK]1805 [MASK] After hostilities of the War of the Second Coalition ended in 1801 , Archduke Charles--the emperor 's brother--took advantag[MASK] of the subsequent years of peace to develop a military restructuring plan . He caref[MASK]lly put this plan into eff[MASK]ct beginning in [MASK]803 – 04 , but implementation was incomplete in 1805 when Karl Mac[MASK] , Lieutenant Field Marshal and [MASK]uartermaster @-@ General of the Army , implemented his own restructu[MASK]ing . Mack bypassed Charles ' methodical approach [MASK] Occurring in the field , Mack 's plan also undermined the overall command and orga[MASK]izational str[MASK]cture . Regardless , Mack sent an[MASK]enthusiastic report to Vienna on the military 's readi[MASK]ess . Furthermore , after misreading Napoleon 's[MASK]maneuvers in Württemberg[MASK], Ma[MASK]k also report[MASK]d to Vienna on the weakness of French dispositions . His reports convince[MASK][MASK]the war party advising the emperor , Francis[MASK]II , to enter the conflict against France , despite Charles ' own advice to the contrary . Res[MASK]onding to the report and rampant anti @-@ French feve[MASK] [MASK]n Vienna [MASK] F[MASK]ancis dismissed Charles from his post as generalissimo and appointed hi[MASK] Francophobic brother @-@ in @[MASK]@ law[MASK], Archduke Ferdinand , as commander . 
 The inexperienced Ferdinand was a poor choice of repl[MASK]cement for the capable Charles , having neither[MASK][MASK]aturity nor aptitude for the a[MASK]signment . Although Ferdinand retained nominal command , day @-@ to @-@ day decisions were placed in the hands of Mack , equal[MASK]y ill @-@ suited for such[MASK]an important assignment . When Mack was wounded early in the campai[MASK]n , he was unable to take full charge of the army . Consequently , command further devolved to Lieutenant Field Marshal Karl[MASK]Philipp , Prince of Schwarzenberg , an able cavalry officer but inexperience[MASK] in the c[MASK]mmand of such a large army .

 The campaign in the upper Danube [MASK]alley began in October , with seve[MASK]al clashes in Swa[MASK]ia . Near the Bavarian town of W[MASK][MASK]tingen , 40 kilometers ( 25 mi ) nor[MASK]hwest of Augsburg , on 8 Octob[MASK]r the 1st Regiment of dragoons , part of Murat 's Reserve Cavalry Corps ,[MASK]and grenadiers [MASK]f Lannes ' V Corps surprised an Austrian force half its size . The Austrians were arrayed in a line and [MASK]nable to form their defensiv[MASK] squares quickly e[MASK]ough to protect themselves from the 4 @,@ 000 dragoons and 8 @,@ 000 grenadiers . Nearly 3 @,@ 000 Austrians were c[MASK]ptured and[MASK]over 400 were killed or wounded . A day later , at another small town , Günzburg--immediately south of the Danube River[MASK]-the French 59th Regiment of [MASK]he Line st[MASK]rmed a bridge over the Danube and , humi[MASK]iatingly ,[MASK]chased two large Austrian columns toward Ulm . 
 Th[MASK] campaign was not entirely bad news for Vienna . At Haslach , Johann von Klenau [MASK]rrange[MASK] his 25 @,@ 000 infantry and cavalry in a prime defensive position and , on 11 October , the overly confident Gener[MASK]l of Division Pierre Dupont de l 'Étang attacked Klenau 's force with fewer than 8 @,@ 000 men . The French lost 1 @,@ 500 men killed and wounded . Aside from taking the Imperial Eagles [MASK]nd guidons of[MASK]the 15th an[MASK] 17t[MASK] Dragoons , Klenau 's force also captured 900 men , 11 guns and 18 ammunition wagons . 
 Klenau 's victory was a singular success . On 14 October Mack sent two columns out of Ulm in preparation for a breakou[MASK] to the north : one under Johann Sigismund Riesch headed toward[MASK]Elchingen to secure the bridge there , and the other under Franz von Werneck went[MASK]north with most of the heavy artillery . Recognizing the opportu[MASK]ity , Marshal Michel Ney hurried the re[MASK]t of his VI Corps forward to re @-@ establish contact with Dupont , who [MASK]as still north of the Danube . In a two @-@ pronged attack Ney sent one div[MASK]sion to the south of Elch[MASK]ngen on the r[MASK]ght [MASK]ank [MASK]f the D[MASK]nube .[MASK]This division began the assault at Elchingen . At the same t[MASK]me another division crossed the river to the east and moved west against Riesch 's position . After clearing Au[MASK]trian pickets from a[MASK]bridge , the French[MASK]attacked and captured a strategically located abbey at the top of the hill at bayonet[MASK]point . The Austrian cavalry unsuccessfully tried to fend off the French , but the Austrian infantry broke and ran . In this engagement alone , the Austrians lost more than[MASK]half their reserve art[MASK]llery park , 6 @,@ 000 ( out of 8 @,@ 000 total participants ) dead , wounded or captured and four colors . Rei[MASK]ch 's column also failed to destroy the bridges[MASK]across the D[MASK]nube . 
 Napoleon 's lightning campaign exp[MASK]sed the Austrian indecisive command structur[MASK] and poor supply apparatus . Mack completely misread the French dispos[MASK]tions and scattered his forces ; as the French defeated each unit separately , the [MASK]urviving Austrians withdrew toward the Ulm fortifications . Napoleon arrived to take personal command of close to [MASK]0 [MASK],@ [MASK]00 men . At Ulm on 16 October Karl Mack surrendered his encircled army of 20 @,@ 000 infantry and 3 @,@ 273 cavalry . The o[MASK]ficers were released on the condition that they not serve against France until formally exch[MASK]nged for French officers captured by the Austrians , an agreement to which they held .

 The few Austri[MASK]n corps not trappe[MASK] at Ulm withdrew toward Vienna , with the French in close pursuit . A Russian army under Gen. Mikhail Kutuzov also maneuvered away from the French , [MASK][MASK]thdraw[MASK]ng to [MASK]he east . At the Ill river on 22 October it joined with the retreating Austrian corps commanded by [MASK]ichael von Kienmayer . On 5 November the Coalition forces held a successful rearguard action in Amstetten . On 7 November the Russians arrived in St. Pölten a[MASK]d c[MASK]ossed the Danube river the next day . Late on 9 November they destroyed the bridges across the Danube , holding the last one at the hamlet of Stein , near t[MASK]e village Krems , until the late aft[MASK][MASK][MASK]oon .

 To the east of Stein , 2 kilometers ( 1 @.@ 2 mi ) d[MASK]wn an old road , lay Krems , with its small population of a few hundred , at the confluence of the stream of that name and [MASK]he Danube . To the west of Stein the Danube made a large curve , crea[MASK]ing a crescent [MASK]-@ shaped floodplain between it and [MASK]he mountains . [MASK]t the [MASK]ar [MASK]estern end of the floodplain , wh[MASK]re the mountains came down almost to the river 's edge , was Dürenstein with its castle , known as Schloss Düren[MASK]t[MASK]in . The ca[MASK]tle had served as a prison for Richard I of England in 1193 . In[MASK]16[MASK]5[MASK]– 46 , during the Thirty Years W[MASK]r , the Swedes had fortified the castle and then demolished it when[MASK]they withdrew . It [MASK]tands at 159 meters ( 522 f[MASK] ) , on the highest ridg[MASK] of a mountain fissu[MASK]ed with clefts and pinnacles of granite . Because the mountain[MASK]was sparsely vegetated , it was difficult to distinguish the ruins from the rocks . N[MASK]rrow c[MASK]nyons [MASK]ut through the mountain , and w[MASK]den into the plain below . Between Düren[MASK]tein and Stein , on the fl[MASK]od plain , lay the hamlets of Ob[MASK]rloiben and Unterloiben . Near the hamlets , the Loiben flood[MASK]plain was at its widest , extending [MASK]t the most 762 meters ( 2 @,@ 500 ft ) from the base of the L[MASK]ibenberg mountain to the [MASK]ank of the river . 
 Th[MASK] region was known for its wine . Since the 15th century the local inhabitants practiced viticulture and the win[MASK] produce[MASK]s [MASK]ormed St. Paul Vintner[MASK] ' G[MASK]ild in 1447 , t[MASK]e o[MASK]dest such [MASK]uild in [MASK]he German @-@ speaking world .

 Napoleon [MASK]ad calculated that Kutuzov would withdraw toward Vienna , expecting reinforcements from Russia ; he envisioned that the armies would engage in a great battl[MASK] at Vienna , and that this battle would decide the war [MASK] Consequently , Napol[MASK]on drew divisions [MASK]rom four of[MASK]the other seven corps of the[MASK]Grande Armée to[MASK]create a new VIII Corps . This corps was [MASK]o secure the north shore of the Danube , block any of the Austrian or Russian groups from reinforcing one anot[MASK]er and , more importantly ,[MASK]prevent Kutuzov from crossing the r[MASK]ver and escaping to Russia . 
 The new VIII Corps , under [MASK]he overall[MASK]command of Édouard Mortier , included three infantry divisions and a division of cavalry ( [MASK]ee Order of Battle [MASK]elow ) . Corps [MASK]ortier , as it was[MASK]known , crossed the Danube at Linz and Passau in early November 1805 and marched east , on the north bank of the[MASK]Danube . Operating independently , the corp 's cavalry conducted reconnaissance ahead of them and on the fla[MASK]ks . Gen. Gazan 's division ( about 6 @,@ 000 men ) took the lea[MASK] ; Mortier was with them . Th[MASK]y were followed[MASK]by Gen. Dupont 's division ( another 4 @,@ 000 [MASK] about one day 's march behind . Jean @[MASK]@ Baptiste Dumonceau 's division ( another 4 @,@ 000 )[MASK], marching[MASK]another day behind Dupont , brought up the rea[MASK] . A flotilla of 50 boats a[MASK]quired at Passau provided communications acros[MASK] the Danube . Before sending Mor[MASK]ier on his mission , Napoleon instructed him to protect his north flan[MASK] at all times against possible R[MASK]ssian reinforcements , advice he reiterated in subsequent written orders . Napoleon also advised Mortier to[MASK]secure al[MASK] crossings of the Danube between Linz an[MASK] Vienna . 
 On 9[MASK]November Gazan 's division reached Marbach an [MASK]er Donau and covered the 50 kilometer[MASK] ( 31 mi ) to Dürenstein by early on the foll[MASK]wing afternoon . Here it skirmished with some Russian patrols to the east of the town and expel[MASK]ed them . Feeling confident , the French established a forward post just upstream fro[MASK] Stein . In Dürens[MASK]ein itself Mortier set up his command post and directe[MASK] the establishment of a small field hospital . Although the position s[MASK]emed secure , [MASK]e had ignored Napoleon '[MASK] strict [MASK]nstructions[MASK]and n[MASK]glected to protect his left ( north ) flank . 
 This failure was an important factor when Mortier lost his corps ' so[MASK]@-@ called " eyes " : after he and Gazan [MASK]ad crossed the Danube , the French dragoons had veered to the northwest , leaving only three squadrons of the 4th Dragoons available for rec[MASK]nna[MASK]ssance . These had left the division and were op[MASK]rating inde[MASK]endently of [MASK]azan 's c[MASK]mmand . Consequently , Mortier and Gaza[MASK] marched [MASK]lindly through the narrow canyon west of Dürenstein , no[MASK] knowing what lay ahead of them[MASK]. Kutuzov had led the Coalition army across the Danub[MASK] at Krems , a short distance past Stein , and[MASK]destroyed the bridge behin[MASK] him . His actions deprived the Frenc[MASK] commanders of a possible route across the[MASK]Danube , putting th[MASK] deployment of the entire French division at further risk in the case of retreat . In this decision Kutuzov abandoned Vienna to the French , who were converging on the Austrian capital from the north , west and southwest , for the security of uniting with reinforcemen[MASK]s from Galicia . Kutuzov chose a military solution over a political one . 
 Un[MASK]nown to either Gazan or Morti[MASK]r , the Coalit[MASK]on had concentrated a force of approximately 2[MASK] @,@ 00[MASK] men ( mostly Russians and a few Austrians ) within a few kilometers of the French p[MASK]sition at Dürenstein . In comparison , Gazan 's division had only 6 @,@ 000 men[MASK]. The Austro @-@ Russian force was a mixture of infantry , Jägers ( usuall[MASK] deployed as skirmishers ) , Russian musketeers and Russian and Austrian cavalry , accompanied by more than 68 ar[MASK]illery pieces . Kutuzov , who had learned the military arts under the tutelage of the legendary Russian Generalissimo [MASK][MASK]vorov , had over[MASK]ll command . The Ru[MASK]sian cavalry , u[MASK]its of the greatly feared Cossacks , were[MASK]well @-@ suited for patrolling the river bank ; indeed , on 9 November they had taken 40 [MASK]rench[MASK]soldiers as prisoners . Furthermore , reinforceme[MASK]ts stood in Moravi[MASK] , less than two weeks ' march away . If the main body of the French army crossed the river , they would require [MASK]ime to prepare [MASK] Kutuzov would have ample warning of any large @-@ scale French movement . 
 Af[MASK]er the afternoon 's init[MASK]al skirmishing wi[MASK]h the French , Kutuzov held a council of war on[MASK]the evening of 10 November at Melk , at the g[MASK]eat abbey there . He knew severa[MASK][MASK]things . First , he k[MASK]ew the positions of the French from prisoners his Cossacks had captured . He also knew that Gazan had crossed at Linz and was well a[MASK]ead of any French reinforcem[MASK]nts : Dupont had crossed at Passau and , by [MASK]0 November , stood at Marbach , 50 kilometers ( 31 mi ) upstream , and Dumonceau was another 7 kil[MASK]meters ( 4 mi ) further behind him . K[MASK]tuzov knew the size of the French force--its division stren[MASK]th--and its positions , and he knew that most of the dragoons were not covering the French flank but had turned north . He als[MASK] knew , or had made a good supposition , about Napoleon 's orders [MASK] so he knew what [MASK][MASK] offer Mortier and Gazan as bait . 
 
 =[MASK]= = Battle plan = = = 
 
 In addition to the Russian[MASK]generals , the council included Austrian commanders Lieutenant Field Marshal Johann Heinrich von Schmitt and Fri[MASK]drich [MASK]arl W[MASK]lhelm , Fürst[MASK]zu Hohenlohe . Schmitt , who had[MASK]retired [MASK]rom the military in 1800 , h[MASK]d been recalled into se[MASK]vice after the Ulm debacle and had come to Kutuzov highly recommended by the Emperor . He w[MASK]s [MASK]n experienced tactician and stra[MASK]egist and had served in a variety of posts in the Habsburg military ; he[MASK]had been Archduke Charles ' trusted adviser during the campaigns fro[MASK] 1796 to 1800 and had assist[MASK]d in planning several of Charles ' victories [MASK] Upon his recall , Schmitt[MASK]was appointed Chief of the Quartermaster General Staff of the Coalition Army . The ge[MASK]erals [MASK]ad found among the Austrian force one Capt. Christoph Freiherr von Stiebar ( 1753 – 1824[MASK]) , who had knowledge of the local geography . 
 Together , Schmitt , Kutuz[MASK]v and the other generals , w[MASK]th von St[MASK]ebar 's advice on the local terrain , concocted a plan to encircle the French at Dürenstein . Russian commander Mikhail Andreyevich Miloradovich wou[MASK]d appr[MASK]ach Gazan 's division from the east , supporte[MASK] by Petr Bagration 's corps , and pin the French in place . Three additional colu[MASK]ns , commanded by Dmitry Dokhturov ([MASK]Doctorov ) , Maj. Gen. Strik and Schmitt , would outflank the French from the west and the north . They would offer , as bait , a rumor : the Russian army was retreating into Moravia and only a rearguard would be left at Krems .

 On the night of 10 – 11 November[MASK]a[MASK]Russian colum[MASK] under Strik 's command began its passage through the [MASK]arrow canyons , intent on ar[MASK]iving at Dürenstein by noon ; two more columns , under Dokhtorov and Schmitt , moved in wider semicircles , planning to pass through the mount[MASK]ins and attack the French , who were extended along the river bank[MASK]. Acc[MASK]rding to the plan , in lat[MASK] morning Strik[MASK]'s column would emerge from the mountains first and launch a fla[MASK]king assault on the[MASK]French right . This flanking attack , combined with Miloradovich 's frontal assault from Stein , would [MASK]orce [MASK]he French int[MASK] a vise ; encircled , they would have no option but to surrender--or die . To ensure the success of the plan , the second an[MASK] third columns , under Dokhtorov and Schmitt , would arrive[MASK]in early and mid @-@ afternoon and suppor[MASK] the earlier assa[MASK]lts . In this way , even if the French t[MASK]ied to retreat west to M[MASK]rbach , they would not escape the vise @-@ like grip of the Coalition army . 
 Mortier accepted the bait of a rumored Russian retreat . In the early morning of 11 November he and Gazan departed fr[MASK]m Dürenstein to seize St[MASK]in and Krems , presuming the [MASK]uss[MASK]ans[MASK]had either abandoned the settlements or left only a small rear @-@ guard behind . As they approached Stein , a column of Miloradovich 's troop[MASK] attacked the French forward positions . Thinking this force was the rumored Russian rear guard , Mortier ordered Gen[MASK] Gazan to counterattack and push east towards the town of Stein . Fighting spread though [MASK]he[MASK]villages of Oberl[MASK][MASK]ben , Unterloiben and the farm at Rothenhof . Instead of withdrawing , as a[MASK]rear guard would , more and more Russ[MASK]an troops appeared and engage[MASK] the French colum[MASK] . 
 Initially Gazan made rapid progress , but he quickly [MASK]ecognized that the opposing force was much stronger than the typical rear guard of a retreat[MASK]ng army . Realizing he had been duped and that Gazan 's troops[MASK]were tiring rapidly , Mortier sent orders to Dupont 's division to hurry forward . By mid @-@ morning the French mom[MASK]ntum had stalled ; Mortier committed most of his remaining [MASK]orces to drivi[MASK]g Miloradovich back , leaving a sing[MASK]e battalion--perhaps 300 [MASK]roops--to cover his northern flank , and sent the rest to attack the Russian right . Within 30 minute[MASK] he achieved the superiority of numbers he sought . His 4 @,@ 500 French opposed 2 @,@ 600 Russians and forced them back toward Stein while pressing an attack along the river . Miloradovich had no opt[MASK]on[MASK], for neithe[MASK] Stri[MASK] 's nor Dokhtorov 's flanking columns were to be seen . 
 At this stage of th[MASK] battle fighting paused . Mortier and Gazan waited for Dupont 's arrival while Kutuz[MASK]v an[MASK] Miloradovich waited for Strik 's and Dokhturov 's . Schmitt '[MASK] column was expected t[MASK] be the [MASK]ast to join the fight because it h[MASK]d to march the greatest distan[MASK]e . The timing of the respite varies , depending o[MASK] w[MASK]ose reports are consu[MASK]ted : f[MASK]ghting[MASK]paused at around 12 : 00 or 14 : 00 . St[MASK]ik arrived first and immediately assa[MASK]lte[MASK] Gazan 's line with three battalions , pushing the French out of Dürenstein . Caught between two strong for[MASK]es , Gazan attemp[MASK]ed to push his way back through Dürenstein , to reach the river where the flotilla could evacuate his exhausted [MASK]roops . Withdrawing through the narrow Danube canyon and fighting off the Russian force at their rear , Gazan and his d[MASK]vision were trapped when more of Stri[MASK] 's Russians appeared to block their retreat . The narrow defiles hampered the Russians ; Strik 's men had [MASK]o march out of the canyons , form ranks and attack in waves . Despite S[MASK]rik 's continuous assault in the next two to three hours , Mortier and Gazan pushed the Russians back up the narrow fissu[MASK]e in the hillside . At this p[MASK]int , Dokhturov 's column appeared behind the French line and joined the battle . The French were outnumbered more than thre[MASK] to one , assaulted in the front by Miloradovich 's colu[MASK]n , [MASK]n the middle by Strik 's and in the rear by Dokhturov . 
[MASK]Earlier in the morning Dupont had proceeded with his column south and east along the river , from Marbach , according to instructions . Even before the arrival of Mortier 's courier , he heard the sound of artillery in the distance and sent riders ahead to discover the cause . They came back to report that a Russian column ( Dokhtu[MASK]ov [MASK]s ) was descending from the mountains to take the road to Dürenstein . Realizing this would separate him from the forward division , Dupont hustled his troops towa[MASK]d the sound [MASK]f battle and deployed them to take the Russians in the fl[MASK]nk . The French assault , heralded by cannon fire , caused Dokhturov 's troops to turn their attention from Gazan 's bele[MASK]guered force to face these [MASK]ew assailants . Alt[MASK]ough superior in numbers , Dokhturov 's column had[MASK]no supporting artillery , and the narrow space prevented them from taking advantage of their size . It was Dokhturov 's turn to face attackers at his front and rear , until the arrival of Schmitt 's column , which had wended i[MASK]s way throug[MASK] the mountains in the west . 
 Schmitt arrived at dusk , and the [MASK]ction continued well after dark ; in mid @-@ November night falls [MASK]t close to 17 : 0[MASK] in the upper Danube climes . Desp[MASK]te the darkness , Schmitt descended out of t[MASK]e defiles and deployed his troops to assail Dupont 's flank . As his Russians entered the fra[MASK] , they came between a battalion of French and another of Russians . With the additional forc[MASK] , the French were o[MASK]erwh[MASK]lmed , but most of the shooting subsided when the combatants could not tell apart friend from[MASK]foe in the dark . Under the cover of darkness , Mortier used the French flotilla to evacuate his exhausted troop[MASK] to the south bank . The F[MASK]ench and Russians continued to skirmish fitf[MASK]lly into the night as sentries enc[MASK]untered one another in th[MASK] dark . Portions of Gazan '[MASK] force provided any necessary rear guard action , and the fol[MASK]owing morning the remaining m[MASK]n were evacuated from the north shore of[MASK]the Danube , while they [MASK]aintained posse[MASK]sion of only Spitz and Weissenkirchen on the north bank . 
 
 = = = Losses = = = 
 
 The losses were staggering : Gazan lost close to 40 pe[MASK]cent of h[MASK]s division to death and wounds . Aside from losing five g[MASK]ns , 47 officers and 895 men under his command were [MASK]aptured , brin[MASK][MASK]ng the loss of effectives closer to 60 percent ; furthermore , he[MASK]lost the eagles of the 4th Infantry Regiment ( France ) and the eagle and guidon of the 4th Dragoon[MASK] . The Russians lost arou[MASK]d 4 @,@ 000[MASK], about 16 percent of their forc[MASK] , and two regimental colors . The Austrian Lieutenant Field Marshal Schmitt w[MASK][MASK] killed as the battle concluded , probably by Rus[MASK]ian [MASK]usketry in the confu[MASK]ed melee . The [MASK]iney[MASK]rds and the villages of Ober- and [MASK]nte[MASK]loiben were destroyed , as was most of Dü[MASK]enstein and Stein . Krems was [MASK]eavily dam[MASK]ged ; the French plundered the to[MASK]n at least twice , and " barbarously ha[MASK]dled " its inhabitants . [MASK] 
 = = Aftermath = = 
 
 Both sides claimed victory . Althoug[MASK] losses were fairly equal in terms of numbers--4,000 wounded or dead on each side--the[MASK]Coalition forces went into battle with 24 @,[MASK] 000 men while the French started with Gazan 's divisi[MASK]n of about[MASK]6 @,@ 000 , which grew close to 8[MASK]@,@ 000 when Dupont 's men joined the fighting in the after[MASK]oon . Regardless , Gaza[MASK] 's division was nearly destroyed ; t[MASK]e 30 percent [MASK]osses experienced by the French fell[MASK]predominantly on his division . Clearly for both sides , the fighting was hard . [MASK]h[MASK] weather had been cold ; an early storm[MASK]had left slick icy mud in the roadways , a[MASK]d icicle[MASK] " like chandeliers " hung from the trees . 
 For the Coalition , the Russians were secure on the north bank of th[MASK] Danube , awaiting reinforcements from Galicia ; the bridges between Linz and Vien[MASK]a had been destroyed[MASK], making French access to the Austrian cap[MASK]tal more difficult , but not impossible . After six mont[MASK]s of fighting in which the Austrians had enjoyed little good news ,[MASK]the Coal[MASK]tion could claim a difficult and timely victo[MASK]y . The French had retreated from the field with a badly[MASK]mauled division and Kutuzov had secured the r[MASK]ght flank . Indeed , Francis was so pleased with [MASK]he out[MASK]om[MASK] at Dürenstein that he awarded Kutuzov the Military Order of Maria Theresa . 
 [MASK]or the Frenc[MASK] , the survival of the Corps Mortier seemed no[MASK]hing short of a m[MASK]racle . The remainder o[MASK] Ga[MASK]an 's division crossed the river the next morning and eventually recuperated in Vienna , which the Fren[MASK][MASK] acquired by deception later [MASK]n the month . More importantly for them , the French force had performed well over difficult terrain and under terrible combat co[MASK]ditions . Initially there had been some panic and parts of at least one French[MASK]battalion had tried to escape on the flotilla craft . They had lost control of the boats in the current and smashed into the pillars of the burned bridge at Krems , overturning their boats . Tossed into the icy river , most had drowned . Despite this initial panic , Gaz[MASK]n 's column retained its cohesion , and responded well to various difficult demands[MASK]. Dupont had demonstrated his tactical acumen : when he heard cannon fire , he directed his troops toward it to support the French d[MASK]vision . In terms of French staffing , Mor[MASK]ier '[MASK] f[MASK]ilure to guard his flank , especially in the face[MASK]of Napoleon 's dir[MASK]ct advice , adversely influenced his relationship with his [MASK]ommander . However , in the immediate [MASK]eeks ahead , the flamboyant Murat did more to annoy Napoleon than Mortier had . I[MASK] assessing the battle and its aftermath , historians have laid the blame and credit for its outcome not only on Mortier and Gazan : " Napol[MASK]on , aware of Mortier 's danger and his own culpab[MASK]l[MASK]ty for it , vented his frustration on [MASK]urat , whom he unjustly accused of abandoning Mortier for the empty glo[MASK]y of riding through Vien[MASK]a . " 
 After th[MASK] victory at[MASK]Austerlitz , Napoleon dispersed the VIII Corps and reassigned [MASK]ortier . However disappointed he may have been with Mortier , Napoleon was ple[MASK]sed with Gazan 's performance . As recognition of his conduct in what the French called " [MASK]he [MASK]mmo[MASK]tal Battle of [MASK]ürenstein " , Gazan received the Officer 's Grand Cross of the Legion of Ho[MASK]or . 
 The loss of Schmitt was a significant blow to the Austrian military organization . Called out [MASK]f retirement for this specific task , he was one of their most experienced general staff o[MASK]ficers , other than the Archduke Charle[MASK] . From the summer of 1796 until his retirement in 1800 he had been Chief of the Quartermaster General Staff of the Army , the Lower Rhine , the Rhine and the [MASK]rmy of Ge[MASK]many . Furthermore , he w[MASK]s a trusted member of Archduke Charles ' staff . He had helped to design several of Charles ' more important victories at Emmendingen , Schliengen , the sieges at Kehl and Hü[MASK]ige[MASK] , the battles[MASK]at Ostrach and Stockach [MASK] and the nor[MASK]hern Swiss Campaign of 1799 th[MASK]t include[MASK] battles at Winterthur and Zürich . An experience[MASK] officer and excellent tactician , h[MASK] m[MASK]ght well have made a more eff[MASK]ctive Ch[MASK]ef of the Quartermaster Ge[MASK]eral Staff of th[MASK] Coalition Army at the Battle of Austerlitz than his eventual replacement , Franz von Weyrother[MASK]. In Schmitt 's absence Weyrother , the architect of the Austrian catastrop[MASK]e at Hohenlinden in 1800 , was chosen to develop the general battle [MASK]lan of Coalition acti[MASK]n [MASK]t Austerlitz . Schmitt , undoubtedly a [MASK]ar better tactician than Weyrother , and possesse[MASK] of superior training an[MASK][MASK]mapping skills , would have developed a mo[MASK]e realistic Coalition plan for Aus[MASK]erlitz . Schmitt 's presence would probably not have been enough to turn that defeat[MASK]into a victory , but it would have mitigated the magnitude of the Coalition 's losses ; Austerlitz was consi[MASK]ered one of Napoleon 's finest[MASK]triumphs[MASK]. 
 [MASK]n the broader picture [MASK] despite the important major naval [MASK]ngagements , the outcome of the War of [MASK]he Third Coalition was determined on the Continent , pred[MASK]minantly in the two major land operations . In the Ulm ca[MASK]paign , the Habsburgs achieved some minor victo[MASK]ies , such as Klenau 's at Haslach @-@ Jungingen , but ultimately lost an entire army an[MASK] an officer corps . The latter would not resume arms against France until f[MASK]rmally excha[MASK]ged . This condit[MASK]on crippled the Austrian military leadership and forced the recall of such pensioners as Schmitt out of [MASK]etirement . After the c[MASK]pitulation at Ulm , isolated portions of the Austrian mil[MASK]tary evaded capture and jo[MASK]ned with their Russian allies ; Michael von K[MASK]enmayer 's corps slipped out of the encirclement[MASK]and joined Kutuzov 's force . A few other small forces refused to capitulate and seemingly melted into the Bavarian mountains and the Thurging[MASK]an forests[MASK], to rea[MASK]pear in Bohemia for Austerlitz . Sixteen hundred cavalry , including Archduke Ferdinand and Prince Schwarzenberg , broke out of [MASK]lm before its capitulation . Maximilian , Count of Merveldt , led his column back through the mountains into Austria , fighting rear gua[MASK]d a[MASK]tions against pursuing [MASK]r[MASK]nch forces at the Steyer ( St[MASK]yr ) and Mariazell [MASK] Th[MASK]se [MASK]lusive units were [MASK]nsufficient t[MASK] balance heavy lo[MASK]ses at key battles in which the Austrians could not hold their own against the French . Between the Ulm capitulation and the Austrian and Russian defeat at Austerlitz , there were other minor achievements[MASK]: a successful skirmish between the cavalry that escaped from Ulm and the French near the town of Nördlingen , the contested victory at Dürenstein , and another within days at Schöngrabern . 
 The second determining event , the decisive French victo[MASK]y at the Battle of Aus[MASK]erl[MASK]tz over the combined Russian and Austrian armies , forced the [MASK]ustria[MASK] withdrawal from the Coalition [MASK] The s[MASK]bse[MASK]uent P[MASK]ace of Pressburg , signed on 26 December 1[MASK]05 , reinforced the earlier t[MASK]eaties of Campo For[MASK]io and Lunéville[MASK]. Furthermore , Austria ceded land t[MASK] Napoleon 's German[MASK]allies , and paid an indemnity of 40 million francs . Victory at Austerlitz also gave Napoleon the latitude to create a buffer zone of German states between France and the states of Prussia [MASK] Russia , and Austria . These measures did not establish a lasting peace [MASK]n the continent . Prussian worries about growing French influence in Central Europe spar[MASK]ed the War of the Fourth Coa[MASK]ition in 1806 , in which Austria did not participate .

 Until 1805 , Dürenstein was probably b[MASK]st known as the village in which crusader Richard the Lionheart was held by Leopold V , Duke of Austria . I[MASK] 1741 , during the War of the Austrian Succession , several hundred local v[MASK]llagers had held off the French and Bavarian armies , intent on capturing Vienna , by painting drain pipes to look like cannons , and beating on dru[MASK]s , thus sug[MASK]esting the presence of a large force . 
 After 1805 , the exploits of 40 @,@ 00[MASK] French , Russian , an[MASK] Austrian soldier[MASK] excited the European imagination . General Schmit[MASK] 's grave has never been found , but in 1811 a monument for him was erected at the Stein Tor , the gate leading from the old village o[MASK] Krems to the hamlet of Stein . [MASK]he ho[MASK]se in which C[MASK]ptain von Stiebar lived was marked with a bronze plate commemorati[MASK]g his contri[MASK]ution to the[MASK]battle . In 1840 , a Spani[MASK]h lithogr[MASK]pher created an image of the battle , which was later expanded by English lithographer John Outhwaite . The image depicts the evacuation of Fre[MASK]ch troops via the Danube flotilla ( see Infobox image ) on a moonlit [MASK]ight . In fact , the moon was [MASK]n its last quarter phase[MASK]48 hours later , a[MASK]d on 11 November probably did not provide as much [MASK]ight as depicted in the image . 
 In 1836 , Jean Antoine Siméon Fort ( French , 1793 – 1861 ) , a historical painter , created a watercolor of the [MASK]attle , Combat de Dürnstein le[MASK]11 novembr[MASK] 1805 ( ( English ) Battle of Dürenstein of[MASK]11 November 1805 ) , which is in the Trianon collection at Vers[MASK]illes . 
 In [MASK]he Russian novel War and Peace , Leo Tolstoy devoted several pages to[MASK]t[MASK]e battle , its prelude , and its aftermath , and the delivery of its news to the Tsar by P[MASK]ince A[MASK]drew . Between Düren[MASK]tein and Rossatz , at the edge of the Loiben plain , stands the " Little Frenchman " memori[MASK]l ( see ima[MASK]e ) erected i[MASK] 1905 to commemorate the battle ; it bears the names of Mortier , Gazan , Kutuzov , Schmitt , and others on a copper @-@ engraved plate .

He has two older brothers named Troy and [MASK]had , and a younge[MASK] sister named Brandi . At age 17 , he joined the National Guard , where he was assigned to an office job after[MASK]his red @-@ green colorblindness was deemed hazard[MASK]us to hi[MASK] desire to work[MASK]with ex[MASK]losives . He lost this job after [MASK]ailing a comp[MASK]ter[MASK]typing test , and later worked for a construction company .

 In 2000 , Lesnar signed with the World Wrestling Federation ( WWF ) . He was sent to its developmental t[MASK]rritory , Ohio Valley Wrestling .[MASK]There , Lesnar first met future friend and manager Paul Heyman . He formed a tag team known as " The Minnesota Stretching Crew " with his for[MASK]er college roomm[MASK]te , Shelton Benjamin . Les[MASK]ar and Benjamin[MASK]won the OVW Southern Tag Team Championship[MASK]on t[MASK]ree separate occasions [MASK] Lesnar wrestled several dark matche[MASK] in 2001 and 2002 before being called up to the main roster . 
 Lesnar debuted on WWF television on the March 18 , 2002 , episode of Raw , coming through the crowd and attacking Al Snow , [MASK]aven and Spike Dudley during their match[MASK]. He was accompanied by Paul Heyman , who was seen giving [MASK]nstructions to Lesnar . When the brand extension was introduced in the WWF , Lesnar was drafted to the Raw brand . Later , Heyman was confirmed to be Lesnar 's agent and gave Lesnar the nickname " The Next [MASK]ig Thing " . Lesnar 's first feud was with the Hardy B[MASK]yz . Lesnar and Jeff Hardy squ[MASK]red of[MASK] at Backlash[MASK]in Lesnar 's first[MASK]official[MASK]televised match . He won the match by knockout after Hardy was unable to [MASK]espond to referee Theodore Long . The next night on Raw , Lesnar faced off aga[MASK]nst Jeff Hardy 's brother , Matt Hardy , and defeated h[MASK]m in the same fashion .

 In June 2002 , Lesnar won the King of the Ring tournament , defeating Bubba Ray Dudley in the first round ,[MASK]Booker T in the quarter @-@ finals [MASK] Test in the semi @-@ finals[MASK], and Rob Van Dam in the finals , earning him a shot at the WWE Undisputed Championship at SummerSlam . On July[MASK]22 , Lesn[MASK]r joined the SmackDown ! brand . After a quick feud wit[MASK] Hollywood Hulk Hogan in August 2002 , Lesnar defeated WWE Undisputed Champion , The Rock at SummerSlam to become the WW[MASK] Undisputed Champion and youngest WWE Champion at age 25 , a record previously held by The Rock . He also became the se[MASK]ond fastest wre[MASK]tler to[MASK]win the WWE Ch[MASK][MASK]pionship since his debut ( 126 days ) b[MASK]hind only Ric Flair ( 113 days ) . [MASK]t the[MASK]time , the Undisputed WWE Championship was being defended on both brands , so Raw General Manager[MASK]Eric [MASK]ischoff expected Lesnar to return to Raw the follow[MASK]ng night . However , SmackDown ! General Manager Stephanie McMahon announced that Lesnar was only required to defe[MASK]d the title on SmackDown ! , for[MASK]ing Bischoff to institute a new champi[MASK]nship for Raw ( the World Heavyweight Championship ) . The WWE [MASK]ndisputed Championship was then renamed the [MASK]WE Championship . 
 Lesnar 's rapid rise to the top of WWE in 2002 led to a feud with The[MASK]Undertaker , which involved a match at Unforgiven . The[MASK]match ended in a double disqualification resulting in Lesnar retaining the title . Lesnar faced The Undertaker again , at No Mercy , this time in a Hell[MASK]in a Cell match . [MASK]eading up to the match , in the storyline , Lesna[MASK] broke the Under[MASK]aker 's hand with a propane [MASK]ank . Des[MASK]ite Heyman b[MASK]gging McMahon not to let The Undertaker[MASK]use his cast as a weapon , the request was denied and the match went on as planned . In a match that saw both wrestlers and even Heyman covered in bl[MASK]od , it en[MASK]ed when Lesnar reversed an attempted[MASK]Tombsto[MASK]e Piledriver into his fi[MASK]ishing F [MASK]-@ 5 maneuver for the win . Six days after[MASK]his Hell in a Cell match with The[MASK]Unde[MASK]taker , Lesnar successfully retained his WWE title in a handicap match with Heyman at th[MASK] Rebellion pay @-@ per @-@ view against E[MASK]ge . 
 Lesnar 's next opponent was Big Show . Heyman was convinced mo[MASK]e than anyone that Lesnar could not win , trying to talk him out of defending the title . Lesnar refused and faced Big Show in Madison Square Garden at the Survivor Series pay @-@ p[MASK]r @-@ view . Towards the end of the match , [MASK]esnar delivered an F @-@ 5 to Big Show , but when he went for the pin , H[MASK]yman pulle[MASK][MASK]the referee out of the ring . This allowed Big Show to capitalize and proceeded to chokeslam Lesnar on a steel chair . Show went on to pin Lesnar and win the title . This loss was Lesnar 's first pinfall loss in WWE and led Lesnar to turn for the first [MASK]ime in his career into a fan favorite . Following Survivor Series , Heyman mad[MASK] it clear that Lesnar would not get a rematch [MASK] an[MASK] had snuck a special clause saying so into his contract . In order to gain his revenge on Big Show and Heyman , Lesnar interfered in his [MASK]irst title de[MASK]ense , which came against Kurt Angle the next month at Armageddon . Lesnar hit the F @-@ 5 on the champion[MASK], which enabled Angl[MASK][MASK]to pin him and win the title .[MASK]On the fol[MASK]owing epis[MASK]de of SmackDown ! , however , Angle introduced Heyman as his manager and[MASK], des[MASK]ite promising[MASK]Lesnar a title shot earlier in the evening , declared that [MASK]esnar still would not get it . Lesnar was [MASK]eaten down by Big Show and Angle after[MASK]the main event , but[MASK]would get his revenge after the show went off the air . He eventually knocked the Big Show out with a steel chair , leaving Ang[MASK]e alone with Lesnar . Lesnar then chased the champion out of t[MASK]e ring and resumed his assault that culminated when Lesnar used the F @-@ 5 to propel Angle 's right knee into the steel ringpost . As paramedics tended[MASK]to a sc[MASK]eaming Angle , Lesnar finishe[MASK] off the assault with a kneebreaker on the ringside barric[MASK]de , breaking the champion 's leg in s[MASK]oryl[MASK]ne . 
 With Angle temporarily put out of action , Lesnar 's rivalry with Heyman and the Big Show re[MASK]umed , which culminated in a match at the Royal Rumb[MASK][MASK] in January 2003 with the winner being placed into the Royal Rumble lat[MASK]r in the evening . Lesnar[MASK]wo[MASK]ld defeat Big Sho[MASK] and entered the Royal Rumble as the # 29 entry , the second to last comp[MASK]titor to enter the match . He eliminated Matt Hardy and The World 's Greatest Tag Team [MASK] which was composed of Cha[MASK]lie Haas and his forme[MASK] OVW teammate , Shelton Benjamin , who were mentored by Angle .[MASK]Lesnar would then [MASK]liminate The Undertak[MASK]r last and win the Royal Rumble , which guaranteed him a title match at [MASK]restleMania XIX . 
 After the Royal Rumble , Lesnar and Chris Benoit faced off ag[MASK]inst Angle , Haas , and Benjamin at N[MASK] Way Out the following month and Lesnar[MASK]'s team won the match . D[MASK]ring the match at WrestleMan[MASK]a , Lesnar botched a shooting star press , a move he 'd done numerous times in developmental mat[MASK]hes , and[MASK]jammed his head and[MASK]neck . This stunned Lesnar and forced Angle and Lesnar to impr[MASK]vise the fin[MASK]sh of the match . Lesnar would defeat Angle , after delivering an F @-@ 5 , to win his second WWE C[MASK]ampionship . Le[MASK]nar wa[MASK] diagnosed w[MASK]th a legitimate concussion from the botched shooting star press . 
 After WrestleMania , Lesnar turned his attention to John Cena , who had returned from injury [MASK]n February 2003 and who had been F @-@ 5'd into a ringpost in the same manner Angle had been . Cena claimed Lesnar nearly [MASK]nded his career and even n[MASK]med his new finishing move [MASK]he [MASK] F.U. " as a jab at the new champion . The feud ended in a match at Backl[MASK]sh when Lesnar[MASK]defe[MASK]ted Cena . On th[MASK] following episode of SmackDown ! , Lesnar[MASK]retu[MASK]ned to his rivalry with Big Sho[MASK] after he injured Rey Mysterio badly during thei[MASK] match at Backlas[MASK] . Show 's attack resulted in [MASK]ysterio being carried out on a stretcher and back board and Bi[MASK] Show took Mysterio off the stretcher and swung the back board into the ringpost , compounding the injury . Lesnar calle[MASK] out [MASK]he [MASK][MASK]g Show , who demanded that Le[MASK]nar put his title on the line against him . This led to a stretch[MASK]r match at Judgment Day for the title . Lesnar successfully retained his title with help from Rey Mysterio and a forklift . During the scripted rivalry , on Sma[MASK]kDown , Lesnar lifted Big Show [MASK]ff the top @-@ rope in a sup[MASK]rplex which caused the ring to collapse on impact . 
 As Lesnar and Big Show continued their rivalry , Kurt Angle returned from [MASK]is neck surgery and he and Lesnar b[MASK]gan to form a more friendly rivalry , as the two were allies yet contenders for the title . At the first ever SmackDown brand @-@ exclusive pay @-@ per @-@ view in July , Vengeance , Lesnar took on Angle and Bi[MASK] Show in a No Disqualification [MASK]riple threat match for his title , which ended after Angle hit the Angle Slam on both[MASK][MASK]ig Show and Lesnar , pinning the champion to become WWE Cha[MASK]pion for a fourth time . 
 Les[MASK]ar continued to aggressively pursue the WWE title des[MASK]ite his friendship with Angle . Mr. McMahon found his way into the angle , at first berating Lesnar , who[MASK]had involved himself [MASK]n McMahon 's rivalry with Zach Gowen , for losing to Angle . This all turned out to be a swerve that ca[MASK]e i[MASK]to focus on the August 7 , 2003 SmackDown ! in Kelowna , British Columbia . That night , Lesnar and [MASK]cMahon were to face each other in a steel cage match with Angle as the specia[MASK] guest referee as per McMahon 's [MASK]rders on the previous wee[MASK] 's program . During t[MASK]e match , Lesnar had pas[MASK]ed out due to a staged backstage incident and[MASK]M[MASK]Mahon was set t[MASK] pin him , but [MASK]ngle refused to allow McMahon to win th[MASK]t way . As the two men began to argu[MASK] , Lesnar rose [MASK]o his feet , revealing the ruse to the crowd , and F @-@ 5'd Ang[MASK]e . He th[MASK]n brutally beat Ang[MASK]e while McMahon watched , and celebrated with him afterwards , turning heel i[MASK] the process . At SummerSlam , L[MASK][MASK]nar lost to Angle when Angle made Lesnar tap out to the ankle lock . After that , Lesnar would cement h[MASK]s hee[MASK] turn by brutalizing smaller wrestlers and attacking his [MASK]ivals on a more consistent basis . He returned to using the F @-@ 5 t[MASK] pr[MASK]pel his opponents ' legs into the ringpost , as he d[MASK]d to Spanky and Gowen , and interfered in Angle 's matches on two separate occasions . On the September 18 , 2003 episode of SmackDown ! , Lesnar received his third shot at Angle in as many months when he faced the champion in a sixty @-@ minute Iron Man match for the title . Lesnar won the match and his third WWE Championship by a final count of five to four . 
 Lesn[MASK]r successfull[MASK] defended his newly w[MASK]n title against the debuting Paul London on October 9 edition of SmackDown ! . He returned [MASK]o feuding with The Undertaker . Lesnar had [MASK]reviously cost Undertaker the title in a match against then @-@ champion Kurt Angle , which granted him a shot at Lesnar 's title . At No Mercy , Lesnar defeated Undertaker in a Biker Chain match . The rivalry then came to an end after The Unde[MASK]taker chose to focus on Mr. McMahon . 
 After[MASK]Paul Heyman returned to WWE as general manager of Sm[MASK]ckDown ! , Lesnar aligned himself with his former manager .[MASK]With Survivor Series coming up , Lesnar decided to challenge Angle to a trad[MASK]tional Survivor Series elimination tag team match . Lesnar chose Big Show as his first teammat[MASK] , with Heyman ad[MASK]ing a returning Nathan Jones and a debuting Matt Morgan t[MASK] bring th[MASK] tea[MASK] number to four . Angle chose Chris Ben[MASK]it and The APA to join his team . However , Faarooq was injured during a match with Lesnar and Angl[MASK] 's team was forced to f[MASK][MASK]d a rep[MASK]acement for him . Lesnar 's team picked A @-@ Train to fill[MASK]the fifth and final spot for them after he att[MASK]cked John Cena , who refused [MASK]o accept an invitation to join Les[MASK]ar 's team . Cena instead joined Angle 's team , and Angle added Hardcore Holly as the fifth member ; Lesnar had injured Holly the year before and he [MASK]adn 't wrestled since . In [MASK]he climax of the match ,[MASK]Chris Benoit became the only second wrestler to make Lesnar tap out . Lesnar faced Benoit in a singl[MASK]s bou[MASK] two wee[MASK]s later fo[MASK] the WWE Championship on SmackDown ! , where Lesnar won after Benoit passed out to Lesnar 's debuting Brock Lock submission hold . 
 The [MASK]urvivor Series event marked the first time Lesnar met Goldberg from the Raw brand . After Lesnar claimed in a backstage interv[MASK]ew that he could beat anybody in t[MASK]e world [MASK] Go[MASK]dberg interrupted the interview and introduced himself to Lesnar , shaking[MASK]hands with[MASK]him befo[MASK]e[MASK]leaving with a staredown . Lesnar followed this rivalry with a feud involving Hardcore Holly . In the storyline , Holly wanted revenge on Lesnar for legitimately injuring his neck during a previous match b[MASK]tween the two in 2002 which left Holly in need of ne[MASK]k surgery and out of action for a year . At the Royal Rumble in 2004 , [MASK]esnar defeated Holly to retain the WWE Championship . Later in the [MASK]oyal Rumble [MASK]atch , Lesnar attacked Gold[MASK]erg and delivered an F @-@ 5 , enabling Kurt[MASK]Angle to eliminate him .

 In February , Lesnar faced Eddie Guerrero for the WWE title at No Way[MASK]Out[MASK]. Late in the match , Goldberg de[MASK]ivered[MASK]a spear to Lesnar while the ref was unconscious . Afterwards ,[MASK]Guerrero went to pin Lesnar but Lesnar kicked out at two . Lesnar then attempted to F @-@ 5 Guerrero but Guerrero reversed it into a DDT . Guerrero then hit a frog splash ; pinning Lesnar to win th[MASK] WWE Championship . An [MASK]ngry Lesnar then began feuding with Goldberg , blaming him for losing his title , and a match was set up between the two at WrestleMania XX . During the feud with Goldberg , Lesnar was also at odds with Stone Cold Steve A[MASK]stin , who was shown suggesting to Goldberg that he attack Lesnar at No Way Out . After Lesnar attacked Austin on Raw and stole his four @-@ wheeler , Austin was insert[MASK]d as the special guest referee for the WrestleMania match . On the March 4 episode [MASK]f SmackDown , Lesnar defea[MASK]ed Hardcore Holly in his last match on a weekly WWE televised show . Behind the scenes , it was [MASK]idely known that the match was Goldberg 's last in WWE . Only a week before WrestleMania , rumors [MASK]urfaced t[MASK]at Lesnar , too , was leaving to pursue a career in the National Football League ( NFL ) . As a result , Lesnar[MASK]'s[MASK]match with Goldberg became a fia[MASK]co as the fans at Madison Square[MASK]Garden jeered and heckled both wrestlers vociferously . Goldberg gained victory after deliv[MASK]ring a Jackhammer to Lesnar and both men subsequ[MASK]ntly received Stone Cold Stunners fro[MASK] Austin .

 On October 8 , 2005 , Lesnar won the IWGP H[MASK]avyweight Championship on his debut match in a three @-@ way match with Kazuyuki Fujita and Masahiro[MASK]Chono at a New Japan Pro Wrestling ( NJPW[MASK]) show in the Tokyo Dome . Lesnar is one of the few American wr[MASK]stlers to have held this title . He won the match by pinning Masahiro Chono after an F @-@ 5 [MASK][MASK]which he had renamed the Verdict since WWE owns the trademark on the F @-[MASK] 5 name . After the match , Lesnar stated that this name was referring to his lawsuit against WWE . 
 On December 6 , WWE filed a motion for a temporary restraining[MASK]order to prevent Lesnar from continuing to work with NJPW , but the co[MASK]rt did not grant it . Following that , he had two non @-@ title victories against Manabu Nakanishi and Yuji Nagata[MASK]. Lesnar successfully[MASK]defended his championship on January 4 , 2006 , against former champion [MASK]hinsuke Nakamu[MASK]a . On January 13 , WWE once again f[MASK]led an injunction agai[MASK]st Lesnar to stop him from defending the IWGP Heavyweight Ch[MASK]mpionship which was also not enforced as he went on to retain his championship against f[MASK]rmer Sumo Wrestling Grand Champion Akebono on March 19 , at the Sumo Hall . Les[MASK]ar had another successful title defense against Giant B[MASK]rnard on May 3 , 2006 . This was the first American vs. Ameri[MASK]an title match in NJP[MASK] since Vader vs. Stan Hanse[MASK] in 1990 . 
 On July 15 , 2006 , New Japan Pro Wrestling announced Lesnar would not return to defend the IWGP [MASK]eavywe[MASK]ght Championship due to " visa issues " and had been stri[MASK]ped of the title . A tournament was held on July 16 to determine the new c[MASK]ampion which was won by Hiroshi Tanahashi . Lesnar continued to possess the physical IWGP Championship belt until late June 2007 . 
 Approximately one year later on June 29 , 2007 , Lesnar defended his IWGP Heavy[MASK]eight Championship against TNA World Heavyweight Champion Kurt Angle in a champion versus champion match . Inoki Genome Federation promoter Antonio Inoki had stated Lesnar was the " proper " IWGP Heavyweight Champion as he was[MASK]not defeated for the [MASK]itle . Angle would defeat Lesnar b[MASK] forcing him to tap ou[MASK] to the Angle lock to win the IWGP Heavyweight Champ[MASK]onship as recognized by IGF and Total Nonstop Action Wrestling ( TNA ) . This was Lesnar 's last match as a professional wrestler until 2012 , when he re @-@ sig[MASK]ed with WWE .

 Lesnar had previously [MASK]igned a non @-@ compete clause in order to be released from hi[MASK] contract with WWE , which prohibited him from working for any other pr[MASK]fessional wrestling companies before[MASK]June 2[MASK]10 . However , he decided to challenge this ruling in court . WWE responded with a counterclaim after Lesnar breached the agreement by appearing at a New Japan Pro W[MASK]estling show in 2004 . In July 2005 , the two sides dropped their claims and entered negotiations to renew their relationship . WWE had offered Lesnar a contract , but on August 2 , 2005 , WWE 's officia[MASK] website reported that Le[MASK]nar had[MASK]withdrawn from any involvement with the company . The lawsuit began to enter settlement talks on September 21 , but[MASK]did not get solved . 
 On January 14 , 2006 , Judge Christopher Droney stated that unless WWE gave him a good argument between then and the 25th , he would rule in fa[MASK]or of Lesnar , giving him a summary judgment . This would have enabled Lesna[MASK] to work anywhere , im[MASK]ediately . WWE wa[MASK] later granted a deadline postponement . On April 24 , WWE an[MASK]ounced on WWE.com that both parties had reached a settlement . On June 12 , a federal judge di[MASK]missed the case at th[MASK] request of both[MASK]legal parties .

Laurinaitis also announced that Lesnar would face Cena at Extreme Rules with t[MASK]e Extreme Rules stipulation later added to the match . Lesnar was dominant throughout the match until Cena punched Lesnar in the [MASK]ace with a steel chain wrapped around his fist . Cena then delivered the Attitude Adjustment to Lesnar onto steel steps[MASK]and Lesnar lost the match . 
 Th[MASK] following night on Raw , WWE 's Chief Operating Offi[MASK]er Triple H refused to give in to Lesnar 's unreasonable contract demands ( which included being gi[MASK]en his own personal jet and having Raw renamed to Monday Night Raw Starring Brock Lesnar ) , resulting[MASK]in Lesna[MASK] attacking him and breaking his arm with a Kimura lock in storyline . The next week on Raw , Pau[MASK] Heyman made his return as Lesnar 's legal rep[MASK]esentative and claimed that Lesnar was quitting WWE . He later announced a laws[MASK]it against WWE for breach of contract . At No Way Out in June , Triple H challenged Lesnar , who was not present , to a match at[MASK]SummerSlam which Lesnar refused . Stephanie McMahon would later goad Heyman into accepting the matc[MASK] on Lesnar 's beha[MASK]f on July 23 at Raw 1000 . On August 19 , at SummerSlam , Lesnar defeated Triple H in a No Disqual[MASK]fication match via submission after once again breaking his arm in storyline . The following night on Raw , Lesnar declared himself the new " King of Kings " and said that he would depart from WWE after his victory over Tri[MASK]le H , stating that he had conquered everything in the company . 
 Lesnar returned on the January 28 , 2013 episode [MASK]f Raw , confronting Vince McMahon who was about to fire Heyman[MASK], and[MASK]Despite Heyman 's pleas , Lesnar hit McMahon wit[MASK] an F @-@ 5 , breaking McMahon 's pelvis in storyline .

On [MASK]he February 25 episode of Raw , Lesnar once again attempted to attack McMahon , onl[MASK] to get into a brawl with the returning Triple H , which resulted in Lesnar legitimately having hi[MASK] he[MASK]d split open and requiring eighteen stitches [MASK] The following week , Triple H is[MASK]ued a challenge to Lesn[MASK]r , requesting [MASK] rematch with him at WrestleMa[MASK]ia 29 , which Lesnar accepted but only after Triple sig[MASK]ed a contract and Lesnar named the stipulation . The [MASK]ollowing week , after Triple H signed the contract and assaulted Heyman , the stipulation was reveale[MASK] as No Holds Barred with [MASK]riple H 's career on the[MASK]line . Lesna[MASK] ended up losing the match after Triple H h[MASK]t him with a Pedigree onto the steel steps . On the April 15 episode of Raw , Lesnar attacked 3MB ( Heath Slater , Drew McIntyre , and Jinder Mahal ) before Heyman challenged Triple H to face Lesnar in a steel cag[MASK] match at Extrem[MASK] Rules , which Tripl[MASK] H accepted the following week . On May 19 at[MASK]the pay @-@ per @-@ view , after interference from Heyman , he defeated Triple H and ended the[MASK]r feud . Lesnar returned on t[MASK]e June 17 episode of Raw , attacking Heyman 's fe[MASK]low client C[MASK] Punk with an F @-@ 5 . Despite the accusations from Punk , Heyman claimed that he was not behind Lesnar 's attack on him . However , in July , Heyman turned on Punk , and claimed that Punk could not beat Lesnar , which led to Lesnar making his [MASK]eturn and attacking Punk on the July 15 episode of Raw . The following w[MASK]ek on Raw , Punk challenged Lesnar to a match at SummerSlam , where[MASK]Lesnar defeated Punk in a no disqualification match . 
 On the December[MASK]30 episode of Raw , Lesnar returned with Heyman to announce his intentions t[MASK] challenge the winner[MASK]of the upcoming WWE World Heavyweight Championship match between Randy Orton and J[MASK]hn Cena at t[MASK]e Roya[MASK] Rumble . Lesnar then dared any wrestler who dis[MASK]pproved of that notion to challenge him , which was answered by Mark Henry , and a brawl would ensue , ending with Lesnar delivering an F @-@ 5 [MASK]o Henry . The following week on Raw ,[MASK]Henry challe[MASK]ged Lesnar again , only to have Lesnar dislocate his [MASK]lbow with the Kimura lock in storyline , and this led Big Show to came out afterwards to confront Lesnar , thus[MASK]starting a feud which was settled at Royal Rumble , where Lesnar defeated t[MASK]e Big S[MASK]ow after attacking him with a steel chair before the match began . On the Fe[MASK]ruary 24 , 2014 episode of Raw , after Heyman stated that Lesnar had requested a match for the WWE World Heavyweight Championship at Wre[MASK]tl[MASK]Mania XXX , instead receiving an open contract to face anyone else of his choosing[MASK], The Undertaker then returned and chokeslammed L[MASK]snar[MASK]through a table ,[MASK]setting up their match at WrestleMan[MASK]a . Lesnar defea[MASK]ed Undertaker after executing three F @-@ 5s , ending his undefeated WrestleMania streak at[MASK]21 , a feat that was described [MASK]y Sports Illu[MASK]trated as being " the most shocking result since [MASK]he Montreal Screwjob " .

 The following night on Raw , Undertaker explained that he had attacked Lesnar no[MASK] for ending his WrestleMania streak , but rather for Lesnar allowing H[MASK]yman to co[MASK]stantly taunt Undertaker about it ; this[MASK]led to the two brawling throughout t[MASK]e arena and a WrestleMania rematch [MASK]eing sche[MASK]uled for SummerSlam on August 23 , where Undertaker would controversially defeat Lesnar ; during the[MASK]match , Undertaker tapped out to a Kimura[MASK]lock by Lesnar and the timekeeper [MASK]ang the bell , but the referee did not see the tapout and demand[MASK]d that the match continue , which saw Undertaker then hi[MASK]ting Lesnar with a low blow and Lesnar passed out to Undertaker 's submis[MASK]ion hold , [MASK]ell 's Gate .

 After his match at WrestleMania XX , Lesnar sidelined his career in W[MASK]E to pursue a caree[MASK] in the National Football League ( NFL ) despite not playing American football since high school . The WWE issued this statement on th[MASK]ir official website , WWE.com , following his departure : 
 Brock Lesnar has made a[MASK]personal decision to put his WWE career on hold t[MASK] prepare to tryout for the National Football League this season . Brock has wrestled his entire profe[MASK]sional career [MASK]n the [MASK]WE and we are proud of his accomplishments and wish him the best in his new ende[MASK]vor . 
 Lesnar l[MASK]ter told a Minnesota radi[MASK] show that he had " three wonderful years " in WWE , but had grown unhappy and always w[MASK]nted to play pro football , adding that he did not want to be 40 years old and wondering if he c[MASK]ul[MASK] have "[MASK]made it " in football . In an interview abo[MASK]t the [MASK]FL , he stated : 
 This is no load of bull ; it 's no WWE stunt . I am dead serious about this . I ain 't afraid of anything and I ain 't afraid of anybody . I 'v[MASK] been an underdog in athletics since I was five . I got zero college offers for wrestling . Now people say I[MASK]can 't play football , that it 's a [MASK]oke . I say I can . I 'm as good an athlete as a lot of guys in the NFL , if not better[MASK]. I 'v[MASK] always had to figh[MASK] for everything . I [MASK]asn 't the best technician in amateur wrestl[MASK]ng but I was strong , had great conditioning , and a hard head . Nobody[MASK]could break me .

 Lesnar had[MASK]a great showing at the[MASK]NFL Combine . On April 17 , 2004[MASK], a minivan collided with his moto[MASK]bike ; he suffered [MASK] b[MASK]oken jaw and left[MASK]hand , a bruised pelvis , and a pulled groin .

On February 2 , 2008 , Lesnar made his debut with the promotion i[MASK] an event titled UFC 81 : Breaking Point against[MASK]former UFC Heavyweight Champion , [MASK]rank Mir . Due to his large hands , Lesnar was wearing 4XL gloves for t[MASK]e fight , making him the second man in Neva[MASK]a 's combat sports history to wear such gloves after Choi Hong @-@ man . Lesnar secured an early takedown and began landing numerous punches but was [MASK]ocked a [MASK]oint after a punch hit Mir on the back of the head . Followin[MASK] another takedown b[MASK] Lesna[MASK] , Mir managed to secure a kne[MASK]bar and[MASK]force a submission at 1 : 30 of the first round and Le[MASK]nar lost in his UFC debut . At UFC 82 , former UFC He[MASK]vyweight Champion and Hall of Famer Mark Coleman was announced to figh[MASK] Lesnar at UFC 87 . Ho[MASK]ever , Coleman withdrew from t[MASK]e f[MASK]ght due to an injury and was replaced[MASK]by [MASK]eath Herring . Lesnar defeated Herring[MASK]by unanimous decision . 
 Lesnar would then face Randy Couture for the UFC Heavyweight Championship at UFC 91 on November 15 . Lesnar would beat Couture via a technical knockout ( TKO ) in the second round to become the new UFC Heavyweight Champion . 
 On December [MASK]7 ,[MASK]2008 , at UFC 92[MASK], Frank Mir defeated Antônio Nogueira for the Interim Heavyweight Championship and was to face Lesnar for the Undisputed UFC Heavyweight Championship at UFC 9[MASK] . Immediately after win[MASK]ing the Interim Heavyweight title , Mir found Lesnar[MASK]in the crowd and sh[MASK]uted[MASK], " You 've got my belt " . Due to a knee injury [MASK]o Mir , the tit[MASK]e unification m[MASK]tch with Lesnar that was origin[MASK]lly s[MASK][MASK]ted to be the UFC 98 main event was postponed . Lesnar won the postponed rematch with Mir at UFC 100 on July 11 , 2009 , via technical knockout in the second ro[MASK]nd . The win[MASK]earned Lesnar Bea[MASK]down of the Year hono[MASK]s [MASK] with Anderson Silva , [MASK]rom Sherdog for 2009 . During his post @-[MASK] match celebration , Lesnar flipped off the crowd who had[MASK]been booing hi[MASK] . Lesnar also made a disparaging comment about the pay @-@ per @-@ view 's primary sponsor Bud Light , claiming they " won 't pay me [MASK]othin ' " and promoted Coors Light instead . Lesnar late[MASK] apologized for his re[MASK]arks at the post @-@ fight press conference , whe[MASK]e he held a[MASK]bottle of Bud Light and endorsed their produc[MASK] . 
 [MASK]n July 1 , 2009 , it was reported t[MASK]at the win[MASK]er of the Shane Carwin vs. Cain Velasquez fight at UFC 104 would face Lesnar but the match was scrapped and Lesnar wa[MASK] scheduled to defend his belt against Shane Carwin at [MASK]FC 106 on November 21 . On October 26[MASK], 2009 , it was announced that Lesna[MASK] pulled out of his[MASK]Carwin bout due to an illness[MASK]. UFC President Dana White said Lesnar had been ill for three weeks , claiming h[MASK] had never been this sick in his life and that it would take him a while to reco[MASK]er ; his fight with Ca[MASK]w[MASK]n was reschedule[MASK] for UFC 108 on January 2 , [MASK]010 . Lesnar initially sought treatment in Canad[MASK] , but later told reporters that he had received " Third World treatment " at a hospital in Brandon , Manit[MASK]ba , and that seeki[MASK]g better treatment in the U.S.[MASK]sav[MASK]d his life . Lesnar went on to criticize Canadian health care further and stated that he shared his experience in an effort to speak " on the behalf of the[MASK]doctors in the United States that don 't want health care reform to happen " . 
 On November 4 , it was confirmed that[MASK]Lesnar was suffering[MASK]from mo[MASK]onucleosis and that his bout with Carwin would have to wait a bit longer and the fight for Lesnar 's heavyweight championship was cancelled . On November 14 , at the UFC[MASK]105 post @-@ fight conference , Dana White stated , " [ Lesnar ] ' s not well and he 's not going to be getting well anytime soon " and that an interim titl[MASK] match might need to be set up . In addition to monon[MASK]cleosis , it was revea[MASK]ed that he was suffering from a serious [MASK]ase of diverticulitis[MASK], an intestinal disorder , which r[MASK]quired surgery . After further diagnosis , Lesnar underwent surgery on November 16 to close a perforation in h[MASK]s intestine that [MASK]ad been leaking fecal matter into his abdomen , c[MASK]usi[MASK]g pain , abscesses , and overtaxing his immune sy[MASK]tem to the point that he contracted mononucleosis . From the level of damage to Lesnar 's system , the surgeon estimated that the intestinal condition had been ongoing for around a year . 
 In January 2010 , Lesnar announced on ESPN 's SportsCenter that he was scheduled to make a return to the UFC in the summ[MASK]r . A match between F[MASK]ank Mir and Shane Carwin took place on March 27 at UFC 111 to determine the Interim Heavyweight [MASK]hampion , and Lesnar 's nex[MASK] oppon[MASK]n[MASK] . Shane Carwin defeated [MASK]ir via knockout in the first round , becoming the new Interim Champion . After the fight , Lesnar came into the ring and stated , " It was a good fight but he 's wearing a belt t[MASK]at 's a make @-@ believe belt . I 've got the real championship belt " . Lesnar faced Carwin at UFC 116 to unify the heavyweight titles . Early in the first round , Carwin knocked Lesna[MASK] down with punch[MASK], gave him a cut above his left eye , and us[MASK]d a ground and pound attack the rest[MASK]of the round . In the next round , Lesnar was able to take Car[MASK]in down , attain [MASK] full mount [MASK] then move into side @-@ control and finish the fight with an arm triangle choke . With the vict[MASK]ry , Lesnar became the Undisputed UFC Heavyweight Champion , earning his first Submission of the Night and[MASK]givi[MASK]g Car[MASK]in his first loss . The win also tie[MASK] a UFC record for most consecutive successful Heavyw[MASK]ight Championship defenses . 
 Lesnar 's next defense was against u[MASK]defeated top contender Cain Velasq[MASK]ez on October 23 , at the Honda Center in Anaheim , California at UFC 121 [MASK] Da[MASK]a White announced via SportsNation that the UFC would bring back UFC Primetime to hype the fight . He was defeated by Velasquez for the title by TKO in th[MASK] f[MASK]rst round . 
 On January 11 , 2011 , Lesnar was announced as a coach of The Ultimate Fighter Season 13 , opposite Junior dos Santos , with the two ex[MASK]ected to fight on June 11 at UFC 13[MASK] , however , he was struck wi[MASK]h another bout of diverticuliti[MASK] and ha[MASK] to with[MASK]raw from the fight on May 12 . He was replaced by Shane Carwin , who ended u[MASK] [MASK]osing against dos Santos . Lesnar underwent surgery on May 27 to help battle his problems with diverticuliti[MASK] . D[MASK]na White said that he had a 12 @-@ inch piece of his colon[MASK]removed[MASK]. 
 In its May 2011 issue , ESPN 's magazine published a story listing the highest paid athlete based [MASK]n base salary an[MASK] earnings for the most recent calendar year or most recent season in 30 spo[MASK]ts . Lesnar topped[MASK]the list for MMA at $ 5 @.@ 3 million [MASK] which included his report[MASK]d bout salaries and es[MASK]imated pay @-@ per @-@ view bonuses . 
 In the summer of 2011 , Lesnar announced that he was ret[MASK]rning to [MASK]ction , stating , " I feel like a new[MASK]man . Healthy . Strong . I feel like I[MASK]used to fee[MASK] " . His return match was scheduled to be at UFC 141 on December 30 in Las Vegas against former Strikeforce heavyweight champion Alistair[MASK]Overeem . Overeem won the fight by way of technical knockout in th[MASK] first r[MASK]und . The result of the f[MASK]ght[MASK]remains controversial , as[MASK]Overeem tested posit[MASK]ve for elevated levels of testosterone prior to his next fight . Lesnar then announced his retirement from MM[MASK] , mentioning his struggles with diverticulitis and saying " tonight was the last time you 'll see me in the octagon " . 
 Speculation about a return to MMA lasted until[MASK]March 24 , 2015 , when Lesnar announc[MASK]d in an interview on SportsCenter that he had re @-@ signed with WWE and officially closed the door on a return to MMA , even though he w[MASK]s offered a deal " ten times more " than what he had made p[MASK]eviously in his MMA career . He further elaborated that , while he was trainin[MASK] for months for a return to the UFC , he felt " physically great but something was lack[MASK]ng mentally " . Lesnar added that " [ he 's ] an older caveman now , so [ he ] makes smarter caveman decisi[MASK]ns " and that he chose to sign with WWE instead of retu[MASK]ning to MMA because he could " work part @-@ time wit[MASK] full @-@ time pay " .

 Thoug[MASK] Lesnar said he was " closing th[MASK] door on MMA " in March 2015 , UFC announced on June 4 , 2016 , that he would return at UFC 200 on July 9 . WWE confirmed it had granted Lesnar " a one @-@ off opportunity " to compete at UFC 200 before he would return to the company for SummerSlam on August 21 . 
[MASK]Lesnar , representing Canada for the first time in his career , defeat[MASK]d Mark Hunt by unanimous decision ( 29 @-@ 27 ) , avoiding 19 of Hunt '[MASK] 30 attempted standing strikes , and taking him down four times to land 43 significan[MASK] ground strikes , 32 in the fi[MASK]al round . He also won a UFC @-@ record $ 2 @.@ 5 million purse . 
 On July 15 [MASK] Lesnar was notified of a potential anti[MASK]@-@ doping policy violation by the United States [MASK]nti @-@ Doping Agency ( USADA ) stemming from an undis[MASK]losed banned substa[MASK]ce in an out @-@ of @-@ compe[MASK]ition sample collected on June 28 . Shortly after this was announced , WWE said Lesnar 's match with Randy Orton at SummerSlam [MASK]ou[MASK]d still take place . Hunt told UFC to either pay him half of Lesnar 's purse or let him out of his contract . He later changed his mind on Twitter , and asked for the whole purse . UFC has not yet publicly responded to Hunt . Lesnar told the Associated Press , " We will get to the bottom of thi[MASK] . " On July 19 , [MASK]he UF[MASK] announced that [MASK] second sample taken in @-@ competition on July 9 tested positiv[MASK] for the same banned substance discovered in the previous out @-@ of @-@ competition sample .

 Lesnar married Rena Greek , bet[MASK]er known as Sable , on[MASK]May 6 , 2006 . The[MASK] reside on a farm in Maryfield , Saskatchewan , having previously lived in Maple Plain , Minnesota . They have two so[MASK][MASK] : Turk ( born June 3 , 2009 ) and Duke ( born July 21 , 2010 ) . Lesnar also has twins with his former fiancée , Nicole McClain , the first being a son named Luke ( bo[MASK]n Brock Jr . ) and the second a daughter[MASK]named Mya Lynn ( born April 10 [MASK] 2002 ) . Mya is 10 minutes older than L[MASK]ke .[MASK]Lesnar has fu[MASK]l custody of the twins [MASK] and is the stepfather of Mariah , Greek 's daughter with her late husband . 
 Lesnar is a conservative and a supporter of the Republican Party . He is a member of the National Rifle Association , and mad[MASK] an appearan[MASK]e at their annual meeting in May 2011 [MASK]o discu[MASK]s his passion for hunting [MASK]nd his rol[MASK] as a spokesman for Fusion Ammunition . 
 During his first run in WWE , Lesna[MASK] developed addictions to both al[MASK]ohol and painkillers , allegedly drinking a [MASK][MASK]ttl[MASK] of vodka per day[MASK]and[MASK]taking hundreds of Vic[MASK]din pills[MASK]per month to manage the [MASK]ai[MASK] caused by wear and tear on his body[MASK]; he name[MASK] his ac[MASK]ident at W[MASK]estleMania XIX as a particular source o[MASK] pain . [MASK]esnar claims that , as a result of h[MASK]s addiction and mental exhaust[MASK]on , he does not remember " an entire two years " of his WWE c[MASK]reer . 
 In January 2001 , Lesnar was arr[MASK]sted by police in Louisville , Kentucky for suspicion of possessi[MASK]g large [MASK]mounts of anabolic steroids . The charges were dropped when it was discovered that the substances were a legal growth hormone . His lawyer described it as a[MASK]" vitamin type of thing " . 
 On December 15 , 20[MASK]1 , Le[MASK]nar was charged with hunting infractions on a trip to Alberta on November 19 , 2010 . Two charges were dropped , but L[MASK]snar pl[MASK]aded guilty to the charge of [MASK]mproper tagging of an an[MASK]mal . He was fined $ 1 @,@ 72[MASK] and given a six @-@ month hunting suspension . 
 As of July 2016 , Lesnar[MASK]'s eldest son [MASK] Br[MASK]ck Jr. is ranked # 1 in Saskatchewan and # 4 in all of Canada [MASK]n[MASK]amateur wrestling .

 = Constant k[MASK]filter = 
 
 Constan[MASK] k filters , also k @-@ type filters , are a type of electro[MASK][MASK]c filter designed using the image method . They are the or[MASK]ginal and simplest filters produced by this methodology and consist of a ladder network of identical sections of passive components . Historically , they are the fir[MASK]t filters that could approach the ideal filter frequency response to within any prescribed limit with the addition of a sufficient[MASK]numbe[MASK] of sections . However , they are rarely considered for a modern design , the principles b[MASK]hind th[MASK]m having been superseded by other methodologies which a[MASK]e more acc[MASK]rate in their prediction of filter response . 
 
 = = Hist[MASK]ry = = 
 
 Constant k filters were invented by George Campbell . He published hi[MASK] work in 1922 , but[MASK]had clearly invented the filters some time before , as[MASK]his colleague at AT & T Co , Otto Zobel , was already making improvements to the design at this time . Campbell 's filters were fa[MASK] superior t[MASK] the simpler [MASK]ingle element circuits that had been use[MASK] previously . Campbel[MASK] called his filters electric wave[MASK]filters ,[MASK]but this term later came to mean any filter that passes waves of some frequencies but not other[MASK] . Many new forms of wave filter were subsequently i[MASK]vented ; an earl[MASK] ( and impor[MASK]ant ) variatio[MASK] was the m @-@ derived filter by Zobel who coined the term constant k for the Campbell filter in order to distinguish them . 
 The great a[MASK]vantage Campbell 's filters had over the RL circuit and other simple filters of the tim[MASK] wa[MASK] that they could be[MASK]designed for any d[MASK]sired degree of stop band rejection or steepness of tran[MASK]ition between pass band and stop band . It was o[MASK]ly necessa[MASK]y to add more filter s[MASK]ctio[MASK]s until the desired response was obtain[MASK]d . 
 The filters w[MASK]re designed by Campbell for the purpose of separating multiplexed telephone cha[MASK]nels on transmission lines , but their subsequent use has been much more widespread than that . The design techniques used by Campbell have largely been superseded [MASK] However , the ladd[MASK]r topology used [MASK]y Campbell with[MASK]the constant k is still in use[MASK]today with implementations of modern[MASK]filter designs such as the[MASK]Tchebyscheff filter . Campbell gave constant k [MASK]esigns for low @-@ pass , high @-@ pass and band @-@ pass filters . Band @-[MASK] stop and multiple band filters are also possible .

 Some of the impedance terms and section terms used in this article are pictured in the diagram below . Image theory defines quantities in terms of an infinite cascade of two @-@ port sections , and in the case of the filters being discussed , an infinite ladder network of L @-@ sections . Here " L " should not be confused with[MASK]the inductance L – in electronic filter topology , " L " refers to the sp[MASK]cific filter shape which resemble[MASK] inverted letter " L " . 
 The sections of the hypotheti[MASK]al infinite filter are made of series elements [MASK]aving impedance 2Z and shunt elements with admittance 2Y . The factor of two is introduced for mat[MASK]emat[MASK]cal convenience , since it is usual to work in terms of h[MASK]lf @-@ sections where it disappears . The image impedance of the input and output port of a section will generally not be the same . However , for a mid @-@ series section ( that is , a section [MASK]rom halfway through a series element to halfway through the next series element ) will[MASK]have [MASK]he same image impedance on both[MASK]ports due to symmetry . This image [MASK]mpedance[MASK]is designated ZiT due to the " T " topology of[MASK]a mid @-@ series section . Likewise , the image impedance of a mid @-@ shunt section is design[MASK]te[MASK] ZiΠ due to[MASK]the " Π " topology . Half of such a[MASK]" T " or " Π " section is called a half @-@ section , which is also an L @-@ section but with half the element values of the full L @-@ section . The image impedance of the half @-@ sectio[MASK] is dissimilar on the inpu[MASK] and output ports : on the sid[MASK] presenting the series element it is equal to the mid @-@ series ZiT , but on the side presenting the shunt element it is equal to the mid @-@ shunt ZiΠ . There are thus two variant ways of using a half @-@ secti[MASK]n . 
 Parts of this arti[MASK]le or section rely on the [MASK]eader [MASK]s knowledg[MASK] of the compl[MASK]x impedance representation of capacitors and inductors and on knowledge of the frequency domain represen[MASK][MASK]tion of sig[MASK]als . 
 
 = = Derivation = = 
 
 The building block of constant k filters is the half @-@[MASK]section " L " n[MASK]twork , composed of a series impedance Z , and a sh[MASK]nt admittance [MASK]. The " k " in " constant k " is [MASK]he val[MASK]e given by , 
 <formula> 
 Thus , k will have units of impedance , that is , ohms . It[MASK]is readily apparent that in order fo[MASK] k to[MASK]be co[MASK]stant , Y must be the dual impedance of Z. A physica[MASK] interpretation of k can be given by observing that k is th[MASK] limiting value of Zi as the si[MASK]e of the section ( in terms of values of its component[MASK] , such as inductances , capacitances , etc . ) approaches zero , wh[MASK]le keepi[MASK]g k at its initial value . Thus , [MASK] is the characteristic impedance , Z0 , of the transmission line that would be formed by these infinitesimally small sections . It is also the image impedance of the[MASK]section at resonance , in the case of band @-@ pass filters , or at ω =[MASK]0 in the case of low @-@ pass filters . For example , the pictured lo[MASK] @-@ pass half @-@ section has 
 <formula> . 
 Elem[MASK]nts L and C can be made arbitrarily small while retaining the same value of k . Z and Y however , are bo[MASK]h approaching zero , and from the formulae ( below ) for image impedances ,

 and 
 <formula> 
[MASK]Given that the filter does not contain any resistive elements , the image impedance in the pass band of the filter is p[MASK]re[MASK]y real and in the stop band it is pur[MASK]ly imaginary . For example , for the pictured low @-@ pass half @-@ section ,

There are therefore two circuits that can be formed wit[MASK] two identical L @-@ shaped half @-@ sections . Where a port of image impedance ZiT faces another ZiT [MASK] the section is called a Π section . [MASK]here ZiΠ [MASK]aces ZiΠ the s[MASK][MASK]tion so formed is a T section . Further ad[MASK]itions of half @-@ sections to either of these sec[MASK]ion forms a[MASK]ladder network which may start and end with series or shunt elements . 
 It should be borne in mind [MASK]hat the characte[MASK]istics of the filter predicted by [MASK]he image method are only accurate if the section is terminated with its image impedance[MASK].

 = The Snowmen = 
 
 " The Snowmen " is an episode of the British science fict[MASK]on television series Doct[MASK]r Who , first broadcast [MASK]n Christmas Day 2012 on BBC One . It is the eighth Christmas special since th[MASK] show 's 2005 revival and the first to be within a series . It was written by[MASK]head writer[MASK]and executive producer Steven Moffat a[MASK]d di[MASK]ected by Saul Metzstein . 
 The episode is set in the Victorian era and sees the Doctor ( Matt Smith ) brooding with the assistance of Silurian Madame Vastra ( Neve McI[MASK]tosh ) , her wife Jenny Flint ( Catrin Stewart ) and Sontaran Strax ( Dan Starkey ) , a[MASK]ter the loss of companions Amy Pond and Rory Williams [MASK]n the previous episode , " The Angels Take Manhattan " . He is forced out of hiding to in[MASK]estigate mysterious , sentient [MASK]nowmen that are building themselves and meets Clara Oswald ( Jenna @-@ Louise Coleman ) ,[MASK]a governess also investigati[MASK]g the snowmen . They discover that the[MASK]snowmen are being anima[MASK]ed by the Great Intelligence ( [MASK]oice of Ian McKell[MASK]n ) with the h[MASK]lp of a man named Dr Simeon ( Ric[MASK]ard E. Grant ) . 
 Building upon the character 's[MASK]surprise introduction in " Asylum of the Daleks " , " The Snowmen " introd[MASK]ces Clara as the Doctor 's new companion [MASK] though ultimately it would be a third version of her character that would travel with[MASK]the Doctor starting with " The Bells of Saint John " . In addition to Clara , " The Snowmen " also int[MASK]oduces a redesigned TARDIS , revised ti[MASK]le sequence and theme music , and sees changes to the Doctor 's costume . The specia[MASK] was produced in August 2012 , with location fil[MASK]ing in Newport , Wales and Bristol . It received final ratings of 9 @.@ 87 million viewers in the UK , becoming the fourth most @-@ watched programme of Christmas Day . " The Snowmen " was met with mostly positive reviews from critics , most of whom received the introduction and character of Clara well . However , som[MASK] felt that Grant and McKellen were underused as vi[MASK]lains or th[MASK] plot was slight because of the focus on characterisation .

 To[MASK]promote the sp[MASK]cial , three prequels were released . The first was broadcast during the 2012 Children in Nee[MASK] telethon on 16 November 2012 , [MASK]itled " The Great Detective[MASK][MASK] . The Silurian Madame Vast[MASK]a , her human wife Jenny Flint , and the Sontaran Strax ( all returning from " A Good Man[MASK]Goes to War " ) describe a number of strange phenomena to a shadowed fourth dete[MASK]tive . The fourth detective re[MASK]eals hi[MASK]self to be the Doctor , and tells the group that he has retired . 
 A second prequel , titled " Vastra Investig[MASK]tes " , was released online on 17 December 2012 . At the end of a case , Vastra and Jenny converse with an officer from Scotland Yard an[MASK] apologise for Strax 's violent wishes for the culprit 's punishment . Vastra explains Strax 's alien origin as well as her own to the officer , much to his astonishment . Vastra reveals that she was awoken by an extension to the London Underground and initially disliked humans , though that changed when she fell in love with Je[MASK]ny . [MASK]n the carriage ride home , Jenny notices[MASK]it is beginning to snow and Vastra notes that the snow should be impossible because there are no clouds [MASK]n the sk[MASK] . 
 A third prequel , titled " The Battle of Demon 's R[MASK]n — Two D[MASK]ys La[MASK]er " was released on the United States iTunes and Amazon Video stores on 25 March 201[MASK] . Two days after the[MASK]events of " A Good Man Goes to War " , Va[MASK]tra and Je[MASK]ny convince Strax that he is not mortally wounded and inv[MASK]te him to accompany them back to 1[MASK]00s London . The scene had been fi[MASK]med as an extra due to the anticip[MASK]tio[MASK] that fans would ask how Strax was resurrected and came to be in Vastra 's employ .

 In 1842 England , a young boy builds a snowman , but refuses to play with the other children . The snowman starts speaking to the boy , repeating his assertions th[MASK]t the other children are silly . Fifty years later , the boy has g[MASK]own up to be Dr. W[MASK]lter Simeon , proprietor of the Great Intelligence Institute . He hires men to co[MASK]lect samples of snow , which he places in a large sno[MASK] @-@ fi[MASK]led globe in his laboratory before feeding the men to a group of animated snowmen . The Doctor , still despondent after losi[MASK]g his former companions Amy Pond an[MASK] Rory Williams , has parked his TARDIS above Victorian London among[MASK]the c[MASK]ouds . He uses [MASK]is allies [MASK]astra , Jenn[MASK] [MASK] and Strax to[MASK]ke[MASK]p people away from him . They also fill their time investigating mysteries throughout the city . 
 El[MASK]ewhere , barmaid Clara Oswin Oswald investigates a disturbance outside the tave[MASK]n she works at and finds the Doc[MASK]or walking by . He att[MASK]mpts to leave discree[MASK]ly , but Clara follows him to a coach .[MASK]Not wishing to become involved in matte[MASK]s , the Doctor in[MASK][MASK]ructs Strax to bring him [MASK] memory worm that will erase the last hour[MASK]of Cl[MASK]ra 's memo[MASK]i[MASK]s with just a touch . Before they can do so ,[MASK]they are surrounded by snowmen created from snow with psychi[MASK] properties who attack the group . Th[MASK] Doctor realises that[MASK]Clara[MASK]'s thoughts are creati[MASK]g the snowmen and ends the threat [MASK]y instructing her to think of them melting . Clara cautions the Doctor that if he wipes her memory , she will forget how to deal with the snowmen . The Doctor reluctantly allows her to go and ascends a staircase to the sky to[MASK]return to the TARDIS . Clara follows him a[MASK]d knocks on [MASK]he door , but she hides and flees down the staircase w[MASK]en the Doctor answers . Clara returns to her other job as governess for the children of Captain Latimer . She learns that Latimer [MASK]s daughter has been having [MASK]orrible dreams about their previous governes[MASK] returning from the dead . Clara real[MASK]ses that the pond that contains the old go[MASK]erness ' body is the only thing still frozen around them . She attempts to tra[MASK]k down the Doctor but instead attracts the attention of Jenny , who takes her to see Vastra . [MASK]astra tells Clara she gets only one word to impress the Doc[MASK]or with if she wants his help . Clara choo[MASK]es the word " Pond " , which shocks the Doctor and arouses his i[MASK][MASK]erest . 
 Acting on a tip from St[MASK]ax , the Doctor visi[MASK]s the Great Intelligence Institute posing as Sherlock Holmes . He [MASK]onfronts[MASK]Dr. Simeon and find a large glass globe in Sim[MASK]on 's office that contains psychic snow . The Doctor speaks to the Great Intel[MASK]igence , the entity that has been speaki[MASK]g to Dr. Simeon since he [MASK]as a [MASK]oy . He[MASK]learns that the Great Int[MASK]lligence has been controlling the snowmen and has taken interest in Latimer 's pond . The Doctor visits the pond and de[MASK]uces that the Great Intelligence is using th[MASK] old g[MASK]verness ' body as [MASK] DNA blueprint to form an ice creature that will retain its form and not melt . While Clara is putting the children to bed , the frozen body of the governess breaks into the house . The Doctor fi[MASK]hts her off and is [MASK]oined by Vastra , Jenny and [MASK]trax . Dr. Simeon[MASK]arrives with more snowme[MASK] and tells them he wa[MASK]ts the governess ' ice body . The Doctor flees with Clara to the roof of the ma[MASK]sion and then to the [MASK]ARDIS hovering overhead . They [MASK]re pu[MASK]sued [MASK]y the ice governess , whom the [MASK]octor traps under a layer of [MASK]rozen ice crys[MASK]als .[MASK]Inside the TARDIS the Doctor gives C[MASK]ara a TARDIS key , but the ice governess arriv[MASK]s and pulls Clara d[MASK]wn off the cloud . 
 The[MASK]Doctor picks up Clara and takes[MASK]her back to Latimer 's mansion , placi[MASK]g her under medical care of Strax . H[MASK] collects the ice fragments from the governess and places them in a souven[MASK]r London Underground biscuit tin . He and Vastra travel to Simeon 's lab , where the Doctor notes the Intelligence 's[MASK]plan to replace humanity with ice creatures and holds up the tin with the necessary D[MASK]A . Dr Simeon grabs the tin and op[MASK]ns it only to find the memory worm , which latches on to him . The Doctor states that the Great Intelligence , which has [MASK]een existing as a mi[MASK]ror of Dr Sime[MASK]n 's thoughts , will vanish with the era[MASK]ure of Simeon 's me[MASK][MASK]ries . Instead , the Intelligence reveals th[MASK]t it existed long enough that it can now con[MASK]rol Simeon 's body , [MASK]hich it uses to atta[MASK]k Vastra and the Doctor . The influenc[MASK] of the G[MASK]eat Intelligence quickly wane[MASK] , and Simeon falls dead . Outside , a salt @[MASK]@ water rain has sta[MASK]ted , and the Doc[MASK]or sees that another psychic ability has taken c[MASK]ntrol of the snow from the Great Intelligence : the Latimer [MASK]amily , c[MASK]ying fo[MASK] Clara . Strax informs[MASK]the Doctor upon his return to the Latimer mansion that Clara[MASK]only has moments left , and she passes away as the Doctor returns the TARDIS key to her . At her funeral , the Doctor reads Clara 's full name on her[MASK]tombstone and realises she is the w[MASK]man he met in " Asylum of the Daleks " who became a Dalek , whom he refers to as " Souf[MASK]lé Girl " . He gleefully announces that a person dying twice is an impossibility and , biddi[MASK]g farewe[MASK]l to his allies for now , the Docto[MASK] departs in[MASK]the TARDIS to investigate and find Clara . The episode concludes in contemporary times , where a young woman resembling Clara[MASK]walks throu[MASK]h the same graveyard , pausing by Clara 's tombstone .

 The Secon[MASK] Do[MASK]tor previously encountered the Great Intelligence in the serials The Abominab[MASK]e Snowmen ( 196[MASK] ) , set in the 1930s , and The Web of Fear ( 1968 ) , set in the 1960s . In these stories , the Great Intelligence uses robot Yeti as its physical presence . The events of The Web of Fear are alluded to by the Doctor in " The Snowmen " when he presents the London Underground biscuit tin to the Great Intelli[MASK]e[MASK]ce in Dr Simeon 's laboratory ; the Intelligence states , " I do [MASK]ot understand [MASK]hese markings " , in refere[MASK]ce to the 1967 London[MASK]Underground map design on the tin . The Doctor remarks that the [MASK]ndergr[MASK]und i[MASK] a " key strategic weakness in metropolitan living " , referring to ( and possibly settin[MASK] in motion ) the future Yeti attack on Lond[MASK]n via the Underground . 
 Coleman previously[MASK]pl[MASK]yed Oswin [MASK]swald in " Asylum of the Daleks " , though the connection between the two characters is not clarified until Clara reveals she has an interest in soufflés , a trait that Oswin 's character also had . The Doctor , after meeting Clara , wistfully replies[MASK]" those were the da[MASK]s " when sh[MASK] asks why he isn 't staying to get acquainted with her , which are the same words he tell[MASK] Craig Owens ( " Closing Time " ) when Craig comments that the Doctor always wins . The final scenes at the graveyard establish that Clara shares[MASK]the same name as Oswin , leading the Doctor to surmise they are the same person . As seen on her graveston[MASK] , Cl[MASK]ra [MASK]s birthdate is 23 November , the date Doctor Who was first trans[MASK]itted in 1963[MASK].

 Writer Steven Moffat stated that he wanted an " epic " quality to the Christmas special . The story would[MASK]also show how the Doctor had responded to losing his previous companions ; Moffat said that " I think he 's probably reached the point in his life where he 's saying , ' Friendship for me is just postponed bereavement — I [MASK]a[MASK]t to[MASK]be on my own for a wh[MASK]le ' . " Moffat compared [MASK]he withdrawn Doctor seen at the onset of the episode to the[MASK]first appearances of the First Doctor ( William Hartnell ) in 1963 and the [MASK]inth Do[MASK]tor ( Chri[MASK]topher Eccleston ) in 2005 . He also attributed the idea of a retired Doctor to a plot[MASK]p[MASK]oposed b[MASK] Do[MASK]glas Adams in the 1970s , but rejected[MASK]by t[MASK]e production team [MASK]t the time . Continuing the theme introduced with the series ' first five e[MASK]isodes , " The Snowmen " was promoted like a movie[MASK]. A movie poster was released[MASK]in the Radio Times , [MASK]howin[MASK] the Doctor and Clara ascending the ladd[MASK]r to the TARDIS . 
 The episode saw several major design changes for the series . " The Snowmen " is the debut of a redesigned TARDIS interior , as well a[MASK] a new title sequence and variation of the theme tune . The new title seque[MASK]ce features a brief glimpse of the Docto[MASK] 's[MASK]face , the first time si[MASK]ce Sur[MASK]ival , the final serial of the classic series[MASK]in 1989 , that the Doctor 's face has been seen in the title sequence . Moffat had noticed that the TARDIS ' [MASK]esign was getting " progressively wh[MASK]msical " and resembled more[MASK]of a " magical place " rather than a machi[MASK]e . It was[MASK]designed by series production designer Michael Pickwood , w[MASK]o stated that the new int[MASK]rior was also supposed to be " darker and moodier " a[MASK]d pro[MASK]ide an easier access to the " gallery [MASK] of[MASK]the ship when shooting . 
 Th[MASK] Doctor also wears a [MASK]ne @-@[MASK]off costume , Victorian @-@[MASK]themed , which Smith described [MASK]s " a bit Artful Dodger meets the Doctor " . Moffat descr[MASK]bed the new outfit as a " progression " as the Doctor was in " a different phase of his l[MASK]fe now " and [MASK]elt more " grown @-@ up " and fatherlike . The costume was designed by Howard Burden for this episode . " The Snowmen " also co[MASK]tains several reference[MASK] to Sherlock Holmes , including the Doctor dressing up as him . Moffat is co @-@ creator of the BBC series Sherlock , for which Smith auditioned for the role of Doctor W[MASK]tson before b[MASK]ing cast [MASK]s[MASK]the Doctor . In[MASK]addition , the incidental music during the scene bears a [MASK]esemblance to the Sherlock theme . 
 
 =[MASK]= = Casting = =[MASK]= 
 
 Thi[MASK] episode marks the return of Jenna @-@ Louise Coleman , wh[MASK] previously app[MASK]ared in t[MASK]e series opener , " Asylum of the Daleks " . Coleman was cast because of [MASK]er chemistry with Matt Smith , and especially because she was able to talk f[MASK]ster than him . She auditioned [MASK]or t[MASK]e role of Clara , not Oswin from " Asylum " , as the concept [MASK]f the tw[MASK] characters being the same [MASK]nly occurred to Mof[MASK]at whilst casting for Clara . The production team requested that the press and fans who attended advanced screenings [MASK]eep Coleman 's appearance a secret until " Asylum " was broadcast ; the effort was [MASK]ltimately successful . Moffat stated [MASK]hat the introduction of a new compani[MASK]n ma[MASK]e " the show feel different " [MASK]nd brought the story to " a new beginning " with a different person meetin[MASK] the Doctor . Smith said that Clara [MASK][MASK]s different from her predecessor Amy Pon[MASK] ( Karen Gillan ) , which allowed the audience to see a different side of the Doctor . Coleman described her a[MASK] resourceful and not intimidated , citing the reason for followin[MASK] the Doctor at the beginni[MASK]g as pursuing answers . T[MASK][MASK] Clara who would become a travelling companion of the Doctor would not debut until the Spring premiere ,[MASK]" The Bell[MASK] of Saint John " ; save for a brief cameo at the end of " The Snowmen " . Col[MASK]man stated tha[MASK] she p[MASK]ayed each version as in[MASK]ividuals[MASK]w[MASK]th " trust that th[MASK]re would be a payoff " to her m[MASK]stery . 
 Also r[MASK]turning to the series are Neve McIntosh as Madame Vast[MASK]a , Dan Starkey as Strax and Catrin Stewart[MASK]as Jenny . All three previou[MASK]ly appeared in " A Good Man Goes to War " and reprised their roles both in this episode a[MASK]d in t[MASK]e prequels . They returned due to the popu[MASK]arity of Vastra and Jenny ; Mo[MASK]fat considered a spin @-@ off featuring them , though he did not have the time to do it . Instead , he decided to bring them back[MASK]in the main series . Richard E. Grant had previously played the Doctor on two occasion[MASK] , as an alternative Tenth [MASK]octor in the spoof charity special Doctor Who and the Curse of Fatal Death , which was written by Moffat and as an alternative Ninth Doctor in the animated story Scream of the S[MASK]alka which had been intended to be a continuation of the series before it was revived[MASK]in[MASK]2005 . Smith commented that Grant was " born to be a Who villain . He pitche[MASK] it on that perfect level and tone " . Grant 's appearance in Docto[MASK] Who was teased by the BBC via Twitter , announcing his appearance at midnight 5 August 2012 . Tom Ward was drawn to his role because of the quality of the sc[MASK]ipt , and also stated his young [MASK]hildren were pleased that he appeared in the programme . The Great Intelligence was voiced by Sir Ian McKellen . The two children Clara is governess to , Digby and Francesca , were played by real @-@ life brother and sister Joseph and Ellie Darcey @-@ Alden .

 " The Snowmen " was o[MASK]iginally intended to be produced in the fourth production block of the series and be the first episode Coleman shot as her character ; however , it did not [MASK]egin filming until th[MASK] week of 6 August 2012 , after[MASK]Coleman ha[MASK] worked on later episodes while Moffat was writing [MASK]he Christmas speci[MASK]l . The read @-@ through had taken place on [MASK] August 2012 . This was t[MASK]e first Christmas special to be[MASK]filmed in BBC Wales ' new Roath Lock studios . Scenes featuring C[MASK]leman and several guest stars in[MASK]a Victorian setting were fil[MASK]ed in Newport , Wales , while Coleman and[MASK]Smith were also spotted filming in Bristol two weeks later[MASK]on 21 August . Some scenes which used snow props were filmed in Portlan[MASK] Square , Bristol , where filming too[MASK] place overnight on 21 – 22 August 2012 . Bristol was chosen because i[MASK] had Victorian @-@ era architecture[MASK]. Pickwood stated that his favourite set is the London Street with the back of the pub , which he said was based on a sixteenth @-@ century building in Oxford . The locations were blocked off and spray[MASK]d with fake[MASK]snow . 
 The TARDIS on the cloud was achieved[MASK]th[MASK]ough a mix of fog on the studio [MASK]loo[MASK] and post[MASK]@-@ production special effects . Director Saul Metzstein explained that it was difficult to achieve the desired [MASK]ook for the snowmen ; the first ones[MASK]he likened to Zippy from Rainbow whic[MASK] was too " cute " of an a[MASK]pearance , and so the effects team created more menacing CGI faces . Clara 's introduction to the TA[MASK]DIS introduced two novel effects [MASK]or the show . The[MASK]first was a single @[MASK]@ shot camera tracking from a few feet aw[MASK]y from the TARDIS to its interio[MASK] , with the implication of the T[MASK]RDIS 's trans @-@ dimensional na[MASK]ure shown to th[MASK] audience . In the following shot , [MASK]he camera does a complete circle of the TARDIS console , an[MASK]effect n[MASK]t seen since t[MASK]e early days of the show . M[MASK]tzstein wanted to include this shot to further emphasize the " bigger on the inside than the outside " nature of the time [MASK]achine . 
 I[MASK] addition to [MASK]he three prequel [MASK]ini @-@ episodes , the[MASK]cast als[MASK] fi[MASK]med an additional promotional video , " Songtaran Carols , " which the BBC uploaded during the days leading up to the broadcast . The video featured Stark[MASK]y singing modified v[MASK]rsions of several Christmas songs in character as Strax as his castmates look on , before everyone breaks character and begins laughing .

 The episode received mostly po[MASK]itive reviews [MASK] Dan Martin of The Guardian called it " actually the best Christmas Special since ' The Christmas In[MASK]asion ' " and [MASK]he first to be " actually scary [MASK] , with " every[MASK]hing we like " about Doctor Who and Christmas . He praised Coleman 's introduction as Clara and the gang of Vastra , Jenny , a[MASK]d Strax . IGN 's Matt Risley gave " The Snowmen " a s[MASK]ore of 9 @.@ 4 out of 10 , describing it as " a rollicking , riveting masterclass in storytelling " which " refreshingly " lacked traditional Christmas references " in favour of some sparkling dia[MASK]ogue , gorgeous set design and fascinating characterisation " . While he felt that Grant and McKellen were underused , he was[MASK]very positive towards Co[MASK]eman 's " unp[MASK]edictable " Clara . Radio Times reviewer Patrick Mulkern was please[MASK] with the return of the Great Intelligence despite an inconsist[MASK]ncy in the time[MASK]ine he found , and praised the "[MASK]lovely images " a[MASK]d direction of the special , though he felt the variation of the theme music "[MASK]lacks th[MASK] menace " of the original .

[MASK]Nick Setchfield of SFX gave the special four and a half out of five stars , writing that " the pow[MASK]r of emotion saves the day again [MASK] was appropriate in light of the festivities and many fairytales [MASK]eferenced in the story . Setchfield was positive towards t[MASK]e [MASK] terrific " [MASK]omedy with Strax , Colema[MASK] and the " surprisingly underused " [MASK]rant , a[MASK][MASK]well as the new title sequence and TARDIS . While he wrote that the subtle callback of the Great Intelligence was [MASK][MASK]a tad more interesting than [MASK]he usual ' S[MASK] , we meet again ! ' s[MASK]htick " , he ultimatel[MASK] felt their threat " never quite comes into sh[MASK]rp r[MASK]lief " . Neela Debnath of The Independent wro[MASK]e that[MASK]" The Snowmen " was stronger than the previous year 's " The Doctor , the Widow , and the Wardrobe " as it was connected to the overal[MASK] story[MASK]of the series , but " still [MASK]as a way to go if it is to live up t[MASK] ' A Christmas Carol ' " . Despite feeling that it was " enjoyable " , she noted that " the story f[MASK]els [MASK]run[MASK]ate[MASK] and rushed " 
 The Mirror 's Jon Cooper a[MASK]so praised Coleman[MASK]and the new side of the Doctor that was shown , comparing it to Rose Tyler ( Billie Piper ) challenging the Ninth Doctor ( Christopher Eccleston ) . Ho[MASK]ever , he felt th[MASK] character @-@ heavy story was to[MASK]the detriment of the p[MASK]ot , which was " a classic Who set @-@ up that ult[MASK]mately suffers from a lack o[MASK] explanation [ and ] m[MASK]re set @-@ pieces than a coherent who[MASK]e " . H[MASK] felt t[MASK]at the[MASK]episode may not have been accessible for casual vie[MASK]ers , but offered much for fans in time for the programme 's fiftieth anniversary .

Later [MASK]n the month i[MASK] commenced anti @-@ submarine patrols and , in January 1942 , bombing raids again[MASK]t Japanese bases . As the Japanese advanced into the South West Pacific , No. 20 Squadron was also responsible fo[MASK] evacuating white ci[MASK]ilia[MASK]s from areas threatened by invasion . On 21 January , one of its Catalinas located the Japanese fleet steaming for Rabaul and signalle[MASK] a warning t[MASK] the town 's Australian defenders before b[MASK]ing s[MASK]ot down b[MASK] anti @-@ aircraft fire ; it was the squad[MASK]on 's first combat loss . 
 In the wake of the fall of Rabaul , the Catalin[MASK]s of Nos. 11 and 20 Squadron[MASK] became the RAA[MASK] 's only offensive weapon against the Japanese . Their raids on Rabaul did little to stem the Japanese advance , [MASK]nd in the following months Port M[MASK]resby itself was subjected to increasingly frequent attacks , which destroyed aircraft , facilities , and squadron records . In F[MASK]bruary 1942[MASK], the Short Empires operated by Nos. 11 and 20 Squadrons were transferr[MASK]d to the newly formed No. [MASK]3 ( Transport ) Squadron . No.[MASK][MASK]0 Squadron lost two Catalinas during patrols on 4 and 6 May ; the[MASK]nine crewmen o[MASK] the fi[MASK]st were later found to have been captured and beheaded ; the crew of the second were also captured and subsequently disappeared without trace . 
 In response to the threat of invasion [MASK]t Port Moresby , Nos. 11 and 20 Squadrons[MASK][MASK][MASK]ved to Bowen , Queensland , on 7 May 1942 . They were soon attacking Japanese targets in Lae , Salamau[MASK] and Rabaul . On[MASK]27 June , eac[MASK] squadron contributed an [MASK]ircraft to a four @-@ h[MASK]ur raid over Lae and Salamaua during which , as well as bombs , the RAAF crews[MASK]dropped beer bo[MASK]tles to disrupt the enem[MASK] soldier[MASK] ' sleep — the sound they made falling through the air was , according to the official history , " s[MASK]mething between a shrill whistle and a scream " . By 1 July , No. 20 Squadron 's strength[MASK]was six Catalinas [MASK]nd 175 per[MASK]onnel , out of a planned estab[MASK]ishment of[MASK]nine aircraft and 415 [MASK]ersonnel . Its prime responsibility i[MASK] early 1942 was maritime reconnaissance as far as New Guinea , the Solomon Islands , and New Caledonia ; the latter half o[MASK] the year saw a greater focus on n[MASK]ght bombing . Now comprising 252 officers and men , the squadron reloca[MASK]ed to Cairns on 11 November 1942 . From Cairns it continued to conduct reconnaissance , anti @-@ submarine and occasional bombing operations over th[MASK] waters [MASK]round New Guinea . Between Dece[MASK]ber 1[MASK]42 and March 1943 , No. 20 Squadron 's aircraft flew a total of 9 @,[MASK] 629 hours and dropped 227 tons o[MASK] bombs . The squadron 's role changed in June 1943 when it commenced mine @-@ laying operations over the Netherlands East Indies and the Philippines , though it continued to make some bombing raids and supply drops . 
 In September 1944 [MASK] N[MASK]. 20 Sq[MASK]adron became part of No. 76 Wing RAAF [MASK] along with Nos. 42 and 43 Squadrons , and moved to [MASK]arwin , Northern Territory . All [MASK]hree squadrons operated Catalinas , their p[MASK]imary purpose being mine @-@ laying . On the night of 30 September , a Catalina of No. 2[MASK] Squadron was shot down while attacking a ship at Pomelaa in the Dutch East Indies ; the loss was compounded by the fact that one of [MASK]he c[MASK]ordinators of the mining campaign , Lieutenant Comma[MASK]der P.E. Carr of the Royal Austr[MASK]lian Navy , was aboard the plane and was captured by the Japanese . Anoth[MASK]r of the squadron 's Catalinas went down on the night of 27 / 28 January 1945 , possibly in a cyclone over t[MASK]e Timor Sea , du[MASK]ing the camp[MASK]ign to mine Surabaya . In March , a detachment o[MASK] four No. 20[MASK]Squadron aircraft , along with four from No. 43 Squadron , la[MASK]d mines off[MASK]the coast of southern China and Formossa as part[MASK]of a No. 76 Wing offensive i[MASK][MASK]this area ; these operations were conducted from Leyte Gulf in the Philippines . One of No. 20 S[MASK]uadron 's Catalinas was los[MASK] on the night of 7 / 8 Ma[MASK]ch , most likely owing to bad weather rather th[MASK]n enemy action . Three of the squadron 's aircraft mi[MASK]ed the entrance to Hong Kong harbour on 8 April and , on 26 May , four of its Catalinas mined Wenchow ha[MASK]bour in China , th[MASK] furthes[MASK] n[MASK]rth that any Australian a[MASK]rcraft infiltrated during the war i[MASK] the Pacific . Thre[MASK] of its aircraft fle[MASK] the RAAF 's [MASK]ast[MASK]mine @-@ laying mission on [MASK]0 July . 
 No. 20 Squadron 's final wartime sortie was a patrol on 14 August 1945 . Followi[MASK]g the en[MASK] of the war , the squadron opera[MASK]ed in the transport role and ferried Australian pri[MASK]oners of[MASK]war home from various [MASK]ocations i[MASK] South East Asia . It relocated to RAAF Station Rathmines ,[MASK]New South Wales , on 21 Novem[MASK]er . No.[MASK]20 Squadron flew its last mission , [MASK] transport flight to Balikpapan , on 21 January 1946 , and[MASK]disbanded at Rathmines on 27 March .

 No. [MASK]0 Squadron was reactivated on 1 April 2015 to support airfield operations at RAAF [MASK]ase Woomera , South Australia . Consisting of nine[MASK]un[MASK]formed personnel and one Australian Public Service member un[MASK]er the command of Squadron Lea[MASK]er Simon Bartlett , the squadron formed part of No. 96 Wi[MASK]g , a component of Combat Support Group ( CSG ) . [MASK]he airfield had[MASK]previously been managed under the aus[MASK]ices o[MASK] Aerospace Operatio[MASK]al [MASK]upport Group , but a command @-@ and @-@ control review commissioned by the Chief of Air Force reco[MASK][MASK]ended that ,[MASK]in common with other RAAF airf[MASK]elds , it should be [MASK]dministered by CSG . RAAF Base Woomera , incorporating Woome[MASK]a Village , was one of two Air F[MASK]rce units[MASK]formally esta[MASK]lished on 12 January 2015 as part of a reorganisation of the Woomera Range Complex , the other un[MASK]t being [MASK]AAF Woomera Test[MASK]Range . 
[MASK]The design of the reactivated squadron 's crest includes a wedge @-@ tailed eagle to denot[MASK] courage and nobility , a woomera spear thrower to symbolise the town and its indigenous heritage , Sturt 's Desert Pea to represent South Australia , and the Pl[MASK][MASK]ades star cluster , [MASK]hich features in the [MASK]olklore of[MASK]the local Kokatha people .

 = Light Tank Mk VII Tetrarch = 
 
 The Light Tank Mk VII ( A17 )[MASK], also known as the Tetrarch , was [MASK] British light tank produced by Vickers [MASK]-@ Armstrongs in the late 1930s and deploye[MASK] dur[MASK]ng [MASK]he World War II .[MASK]The Tetrarch was originally designed as th[MASK] latest i[MASK] the line of light tanks built by t[MASK]e company for the British Army . It imp[MASK]oved upon its predecessor , the[MASK]Mk VIB Light Tank , by introducing the extra firepower of a 2 @-@ pounder gun . The War Office ordered[MASK]70 tanks , an order that eventually increased to 220 . Production was delayed by several factors , and as a consequence , only 100 to 177 of the tanks were produc[MASK]d . 
 The tank 's [MASK]esign flaws , combined with the decision by the War Office not to use light tanks in British armoured divisi[MASK]ns , ruled out the use of Tetrarchs i[MASK] the North[MASK]African Camp[MASK]ign . As a result , the majority of the tanks remained in Br[MASK]tain , although 20 were sent to the USSR as part of the Lend @-@ Lease program . In early 1[MASK]41 , the Royal Armoured Corps formed three squadrons for use in overseas amphibious operations , one of which was equipped with Tetrarchs . In May 194[MASK] , a small number of Tetrarchs formed par[MASK] of t[MASK]e British for[MASK]e which participated in the[MASK]inva[MASK]ion of Madagascar , and , in June 1942 , Tetrarchs were attached to the 1st Airborne Division after it was decided that the design allowed its use as an air @-@ portable light tank to support British airborne forces . The Tetrarchs were transported and landed in specially designed General Aircraft Hamilcar gliders . A lack of gliders prevented their participation in the Allied invasion of Sicily in 1943 ; instea[MASK] the[MASK] were attached to the new 6th Airborne Division and becam[MASK] part of the 6th Airborne Armoured Reconnaissance Regiment . 
 The division [MASK]sed appr[MASK]ximately 20 Tetrarchs during the British airborne landings in Normandy in June 1944 . The tanks were successfu[MASK]ly landed by glider , but they did not perform well . Several were lost i[MASK] ac[MASK]id[MASK]nts , and those that did see action proved to be [MASK]nferior in firepower and armour to the armoured [MASK]ighting vehicles of the German forces . A few days[MASK]aft[MASK]r the beginning of the operation , the tanks were remo[MASK]ed from direct engagement with German armour and used only to provi[MASK]e fire sup[MASK]ort . By August 1944 , most of the[MASK]Tetrarchs in action were replaced with Cromwell cruiser tanks , and the remainder w[MASK]re replaced by the M22 Locust in December 1944 . 
 Tetrarchs did [MASK]ot see any further co[MASK]bat and were deemed obsolete by 1[MASK]46 ; the[MASK]last was retired in 19[MASK]0 . There were several variations on the Tetrarch design , i[MASK]cluding the Alecto self @-@ propelled [MASK]un and the Light Tank Mk VIII , but none of these were ever used in active servic[MASK] with the British Army .

 = = = Initial development = = = 
 
 The prototype of the Light Tank Mk VII ( A17 [MASK] , nicknamed ' Purdah ' , was first develop[MASK][MASK] in 1937 by Vickers @-@ Armstrongs as a[MASK]private venture , and was intended to be sold either to the British Army o[MASK] to foreign militarie[MASK] . It was to be the latest in a series of light tanks p[MASK]oduced by the company . The tank [MASK]as de[MASK]igned to ov[MASK]rcome the shortcomings of insufficient armament in earlier light tanks that were fitted only with [MASK]achine guns . Vickers @-@ A[MASK]mstrong installed on the Mk VIIs a 2 @-@ po[MASK]nder 40 @-@ millimetre[MASK]( 1 @.@ 6 in ) [MASK]ain gu[MASK] paired [MASK]ith a 7 @.@ 92 @-@ millimetre ( 0 @.@ [MASK]12 i[MASK] ) Besa machine gun , and mounted the two g[MASK]ns in a two @-@ man turret . The tank possessed a maximum of 14 millimetres ([MASK]0 @.@ 55 in ) of armour . The prototype weighed approximately 16 @,@ 800 pounds[MASK]( 7 @,@ 600 kg ) and was powered by a 165 @-@ horsepower ( 123 kW ) Meado[MASK]s engine . Suspension was on eight road wheels , four per side , with no se[MASK]arate dr[MASK]ver[MASK]or id[MASK]er wheels and it was capable of a 40 miles per hour ( 64 km / h ) top speed . The Mk VII des[MASK]gn relied on an unusual steering method and a mechanical system incorporated i[MASK]to earlier Vickers models . The fro[MASK]t wheels could be steered to allow [MASK]or gentle turns by bending[MASK]the tracks . For sharper turns , the system returned to the conventional metho[MASK] of braking one track to turn the tank ; the dual system of turning was designed to lessen mechanical strain on the MkVII and reduce its power wastage . The suspension system was al[MASK]o a new design [MASK]hat relied on struts with p[MASK]ckets of air for springing and cushions of oil for damping ,[MASK]and each of the wheels was independently sprung . 
 The War Office examined the design and put the prototype through a series of trials during May and June 1938 ; the model was test[MASK]d as a possible " light cruiser " since War Office light tank needs were already met by its predecessor , the Mark VI . The War Office then took the view that the tank was not[MASK]acceptable as a light cruiser bec[MASK]use the Nuffield A13 offered better speed and obstacle cro[MASK]sing per[MASK]ormance . Despite this , it w[MASK]s decided that it[MASK]was essential for s[MASK]me Tetrarchs to be produced , and it was suggested that they be brought in at the end of t[MASK]e light tank program . Accord[MASK]ngly , the War Office gav[MASK] the Tetrarch the off[MASK]cial General Staff specification[MASK]number A17 , and , in November 1938 , accepted it fo[MASK] limited production aft[MASK]r[MASK]requesting a few minor changes wh[MASK][MASK]h included the fitting of an external fuel tank t[MASK] [MASK]ncrease the tank 's range . 
 
 = = = Production = = = 
 
 The number to be produced [MASK]as subject to fluctuation as the War Office vacillated in their demand ; i[MASK] July 1938 , it requested [MASK]hat 70 of the tanks be produced , then increased the request to 120 after a three @-@ day conference in November . Producti[MASK]n wa[MASK] to begin in July 1940 , but meanwhile the War Office temporar[MASK]ly returned to its origina[MASK] order of 70 before increasing [MASK]he number to 100 . Th[MASK] numbe[MASK] further[MASK]increased to 220 after Metropolitan Cammell Carriag[MASK] and Wagon , a company part owned by Vickers[MASK]@-@ Armstrong that would be producing the tanks , indicated it had already ordered armour plating for that many tan[MASK]s . 
 Producti[MASK]n of the tank was delayed by a number of factors . The War Office put t[MASK]eir order on hold in a post @-@ Battle of France decision to focus military production on infantry and cruiser tanks , due to t[MASK]e poor performance of Briti[MASK]h light tanks during that battle . Due to the shortage of more suitable tanks , light [MASK]anks that were not designed for use against German armour , were nevertheless deployed against them ; the resulting high casualties led the War Office to re @-@ evaluate the sui[MASK]ability of the light tank design . The pre @-@ war role of the[MASK]light tank , that of reconnaissance , meanwhile had been found to be better suited[MASK]to scout cars that used sm[MASK]ller crews [MASK]nd had better cross @-@ countr[MASK] abilities . Further [MASK]elays were caused by the bombing raids of the Luftwaffe during May 1941 against the factories where the tanks were assembled . 
 The cumula[MASK]ive e[MASK]fect of these delays resulted in the production o[MASK] only a small number of Mk VIIs ; estimates place the final total produced to be between 100 and 177 . The name ' Tetrarch [MASK] was given to the Mk VII , on 22 September 1941 , on the orders of the War Office . The last of the tanks were built in the first quarter of 1942 and delive[MASK][MASK]d at the end of the year . 
 
 = = = Tran[MASK]fer to airborne role = = = 
 
 [MASK]he War Office and the Army were conclu[MASK]ing , at this point , that light tanks were a lia[MASK]i[MASK]ity and too vulnerable for use[MASK]in further comba[MASK] , and the Tetrarch was considered [MASK]o be obsolete . This decision may have marked the end for the T[MASK]trarch in active service [MASK] several of the tan[MASK]s destined to b[MASK] deployed to the Eighth Army in the Middle East for t[MASK]e North African C[MASK]mpaign were left in Britain when their cooling systems were determined to be unable to cope with the intense North African heat . 
 The demise of Tetrarch was prevented by a [MASK][MASK]cision made by the War Office in mid @-@ 1941 , a[MASK] it was considering the equipment to be used by Britain 's fledgling airborne forces , formed in J[MASK]ne 1940 under the orders of [MASK]he Prime Minister , Winston Church[MASK]ll . When selecting the equipment for the [MASK]irborne forces , officials at the War Office [MASK]oncluded that gliders would be an int[MASK]gr[MASK]l component ; gliders would transport troops and heavy equipment , which , by 194[MASK] , was to i[MASK]clude artillery and some form of tank . Plans to trans[MASK]ort a tank went through[MASK]a number of revisions , but , by May 1941 , the feasibility [MASK]f a 5 @.@ 5 metric tons ( 5 @.@ 4 long tons ) tank to be carried for 350 miles ( 560 km ) in a glider wa[MASK] accepte[MASK] ,[MASK]although the aircraft would have to be speci[MASK]ically designed for the task . In a conference held on 16 January 1941 ,[MASK]it was decided that the General Aircraft Hamilcar , currently under development[MASK], would be used to transport a single Tetrarch tank or two Universal Carr[MASK]ers . The Tetrarch was chosen because it was an obsolete d[MASK]sign , and was therefore available to be[MASK]used by the airborne forces . 
 Beginning in Janua[MASK]y 1944 , training[MASK]exercises were conducted carrying the Te[MASK]rarchs and their crews inside Hamilcar gliders . These exercises were successful ; during the trainin[MASK] by ' C ' Squadron of the [MASK]lider P[MASK]lot Regiment , which specialised in flying the Hamilcars , [MASK]ver 2 @,@ 800 lifts were made with an average of 50 lifts per cr[MASK]w . Only three incidents resulted in fatalities or injuries , [MASK]ith seven pilots killed during the training . Wh[MASK]n the Tet[MASK]arch was re @-@ d[MASK]signated as an airborne tank , several changes were made to its d[MASK]sign . A number of tanks had their 2 pounder guns [MASK]eplaced with a 76 @.@ 2 @-@ millimetre ( 3 @.@ 00 in ) infantry support howitzer ; the[MASK]e tanks were then designated as Tetrarch 1 CS ( Close Sup[MASK][MASK]rt ) . Additionally , Littlejohn adaptors were adde[MASK] to those Tetrarchs which still pos[MASK]essed their 2 pounders to increase their muzzle velocity and armour penetration . 
 The Tetrarch experienced several setbacks throughout its development and depl[MASK]yment with the Army and airborne[MASK]forces . One of [MASK]he ma[MASK]or pr[MASK]blems was the limited number of these tanks tha[MASK] existed after production ended in 1942 , wh[MASK]ch particularly affected the airborne forces . The transport of 20 of the tanks to the USSR under the Lend @-@ Lease Act depleted the number available for use by airborne forces , as did the loss of several more during Operation Ironclad , the invasion of Madagascar . A Royal Armoured Corps report issued[MASK]in December 1942 stated that approximately 50 Tetrarchs were available for use . In a memorandum , dated January 1943 , by M[MASK]jor General George F. Hopkinson , commander of the 1st Airborne Di[MASK]ision , Hopkinson complained that he had bee[MASK] informed that 70 of the tanks were avai[MASK]able , where[MASK]s only 50 actually remained , with no reserves to replace those lost in combat . This lack of sufficient replacement reserves , combined wit[MASK] a War Office report that some 287 airborne tanks would be required for the 1st Airborne Division and an unnamed airborne division to be formed in India , led to the Tetrarch 's eventual replacement by the US M22 Locust .[MASK]
 
 = = Pe[MASK]formance = = 
 
 A number of design faults of the Tetrarch were revealed through its operational use . Its size li[MASK]ited the possible crew to three , a driver in the[MASK]hull and a gunner and comm[MASK]nder in the turret , resulting in too few crew members to opera[MASK]e the Tetrarch e[MASK]fectively . The gunner or commander ,[MASK]in addition to his own duties , had to act as loader for [MASK]he 2 pounder , which caused delays in combat . A report on the tank written i[MASK] January 1941 stated that as the commander had to both fight and control the tank , controlling a troop of Tetr[MASK]rchs duri[MASK]g combat would be almost impossible . 
 Problems were also found with the Littlejohn adap[MASK]or fitted to t[MASK]e 2 @-@ pounder to increase i[MASK]s range an[MASK] penetration power ; after they had bee[MASK] fitted the[MASK]adapters could not be rem[MASK]ved , and could only [MASK]ire specially designed armour @-[MASK] pierci[MASK]g rounds , which took time to manufacture . 
 The War Office also [MASK]onsidered [MASK][MASK]e Tetrarch 's cooling system faulty , mak[MASK]ng the tank unsuitable for service in hotter climates , such as the Middle East and North Africa .

 The first Tetrarchs were delivered to the Army in November 1940 , and[MASK]were initially deployed with the 1st Armoured Division ( which wa[MASK] being refitted after losin[MASK] the majority of its previous tanks during the Battle of France ) and the newly formed 6th Armoured Division .[MASK]However , the faults discovered with the Tetrarch cooling system precluded them from being integrated into units that were sent to the Middle East to partic[MASK]pate in the North [MASK]frican Campaign . Shortly after , all light tanks were discarded fro[MASK] the establishments of British armoured divisions as not suitab[MASK]e for further service . 
 The Tetrarchs remai[MASK]ed in B[MASK]itain , and w[MASK]uld probably have been used as training vehicles before being retired from service , but on 22 June 1941 the German invasion of the USSR , Operation Barbarossa began , and the USSR became an ally of Britain . The Lend @-@ Lease program , begun in March 1941 by the United States of America to supply defensive materials to [MASK]ritain and China , was t[MASK]erefore extended to the USSR . As part of the program , the Bri[MASK]ish govern[MASK]ent began supplying[MASK]war materials to [MASK]he US[MASK]R , which in early 1942 , included a shipment o[MASK] 20 Tetrarchs , as w[MASK]ll as a number of Valentine[MASK]and Matild[MASK][MASK]Mk I Infantry tanks . The Soviet military utilised a[MASK]greater number of light tanks than the British , and so could use th[MASK] Tetrarchs . When the tanks arrived in the USSR , however , it was apparent that the[MASK]design problems with the cooling sy[MASK]tem were also present in cold[MASK]conditi[MASK]n[MASK] ; additionally , the cold weather had a deleterious effect on the tank 's suspension and tracks . Additio[MASK]al testing of the Tetrarchs was conducted by the Soviet military and the[MASK]design was[MASK]admired for its controlla[MASK]ility , manoeuvrability , and speed , as well [MASK]ts[MASK]ability to run on low @-@ quality fuel , unlike contemporary Soviet designs . The thinness of the Tetrarch 's armour was found to b[MASK] a problem and one which could not be solved , as the weight of extra ar[MASK]our plating caused an unacceptable reduction in the tank 's speed . Despite these drawbacks in the Te[MASK][MASK]arch 's desig[MASK] [MASK] Soviet authorities believed it to be comparable to the T @-@ 70 light tank in use at the time , an[MASK] decided that it was suitable to be used in combat . A number of Tetrarchs were sent to Tank Traini[MASK]g Schools which were s[MASK]bsequently sent [MASK]nto battle , and in September 1943 two were assigned to the 132nd Separated Tank Battalion , which was attached to the 5th Guards Tank Brigade ; both tanks were de[MASK]troyed in combat , one on 3[MASK] September and the other on 2 October , the latter a casualty of artillery fire . Several were also[MASK]used fo[MASK] propaganda purposes , a[MASK]pearing [MASK][MASK] photographs[MASK]of Soviet troops who were fighting in the Caucasus region .

[MASK]
 In[MASK]mid @-@ 1941 , the Royal Armoured[MASK]Corps in Britain created three ta[MASK]k squadrons for special overseas operations [MASK] known as ' A ' , ' B ' and ' C ' Special Service Squadrons . Both ' A ' and ' B ' [MASK]quadrons were equipped with Valentine Infantry tanks and Mark [MASK]I[MASK] light tanks , but ' C ' [MASK]quadron was equipped with twelve Te[MASK]rarchs transferred from the 2nd Armoured Brigade , 1st Armoured Division . On [MASK]1 July 1941 , ' C ' Squadron was officially activated and imme[MASK]iately received orders to prepare for overseas service alongside ' A ' and ' B ' Squadrons in an unspecified[MASK]tropical climate . All t[MASK]ree squadrons were transported to Inverary in Scotland for intensi[MASK]e training that focused on embarkation and disembarkatio[MASK] from ships and landing cr[MASK]ft to prepare them for action in potential am[MASK]hibious operations . In early[MASK]Se[MASK]tember ,[MASK]elements of ' C ' Squadron , including six Tetrarchs , formed part of a force which s[MASK]ile[MASK] for Freetown in West Afric[MASK] ; during t[MASK]is period o[MASK] the war[MASK]there were fears that the Spanish government might enter the conflict on the[MASK]side of Ger[MASK]a[MASK]y , and the force was readied to capture a number [MASK]f Spanish islands off the coast of Africa if thi[MASK] occurred . These f[MASK]ars proved groundless , and in March 1942 , the unit returned to Britain to join the rest of the squadron in training . 
 The next assignment , Operation Ironclad , was the invasion of Madagascar , the third largest island in the world and then under Vichy French control . The P[MASK]ime Ministe[MASK] and the Combined Chiefs of Staff decided that Madagascar should be occ[MASK]pied as rapidly as possible to d[MASK]ny the port of Antsirane to Japanese naval forces , which had recent[MASK]y adv[MASK]nced into the [MASK]ndian Ocean . Operation Ironclad was under the c[MASK]mmand of Major General Robert G. Sturges and consisted of No. 5 Commando , 29th Independent Brigade Group , and the 17th and 13th [MASK]rigade groups from 5th Infan[MASK]ry Division . The [MASK]9th Brigade formed the core of the invasion force due t[MASK] its training in a[MASK]phibious operations [MASK] and under its [MASK]ommand [MASK]as ' B ' Special[MASK]Service Squadron , created by amalgamating [MASK]ix Valentines from ' B ' Squadron and six Tetrarchs from ' C ' Squadron into a single unit . [MASK]he squadr[MASK]n was form[MASK]d into four troops , one Headqu[MASK]rters[MASK]troop of three Valentin[MASK]s a[MASK]d one Tetrarch , one of four Valen[MASK]ines , and two f[MASK]rmed from the remaining five Tetrarchs . The invasion force assembled off the west coast of [MASK]he[MASK]northern tip of Madagascar o[MASK] 4 May , near Antsirane and the bay of Diego Suarez . The invasion plan called for an amphibious assault landing on four beaches on the we[MASK]t side of the tip , which woul[MASK] allow the Br[MASK]tis[MASK] forces to advance approximately 20 miles ( 32 km ) and approach Antsirane from the rear . Information about the landing beac[MASK]es ,[MASK]the defences possessed by the port , and the Vichy[MASK]French defending forces was limited and vague , although it was believed that the defen[MASK]ers h[MASK]d no w[MASK]apons capabl[MASK] of penetrating the armour of a Valentine tank . 
 The landings began at 04 [MASK] 30 o[MASK] 5 May , with 5 Commando landing at Courrier Bay and the three infantry brigades and ' B ' Squadron landing at Ambararata [MASK]ay . The objective of the infantry b[MASK]igades and their armoured support was to take control of Antsirane and a nearby town , but although the infantry landed successfully , ' B ' S[MASK]uadron had more t[MASK]ouble ; the area of beach designated for its landing [MASK]raft was blocked for se[MASK]eral hours after [MASK] Tetrarch came loose from a landing craft and became stuck in the sand . The infantry brigades advanced [MASK]oward Antsirane without the squadron , but eventually two Valentines and a single [MASK]etrarch were dispatched in support , catching up with the lead elements of the infantry near the[MASK]town of Anamakia . Here the invasion fo[MASK]ce encountered the first Fren[MASK]h defences , consisting of camouflaged trench[MASK]s and pillboxes dug[MASK]in along a ridge . The tanks attempted to breach them , but the rocky gro[MASK]n[MASK] made manoeuvring difficult and they could [MASK]ot [MASK]lose with the pillboxes and trenches ; the[MASK][MASK]engaged a number of[MASK]targets with 2 pounder and machine @-@ gun fire ,[MASK]but the line had to be cleared by an infantry assau[MASK]t later in the day . The tanks were ordered to outflank the defence[MASK] [MASK]nd advance further into the island , and they were soon jo[MASK]ned by two other Tetrarchs dispatched from the beaches ; the small force continued to advance until it encoun[MASK]ered the Vich[MASK] French main line of defence . This had been built prior to the First World[MASK]War and included camouflaged pillboxes , machine @-@ gun nests and dug[MASK]@-@ in 75 mm art[MASK]llery pieces ; the latter , although not specific[MASK]lly desi[MASK]ned for an anti @-@ tank [MASK]ole , could pene[MASK]rate th[MASK] armour of both the Tetrarchs and the Valentines . The two Va[MASK]entines advanced first but were knocked out by artillery fire , and two Tetrarchs that were moving behind them su[MASK]fered the same fate ; the third Tetrarch retreated in order to report on the French resistance , machine gunning a motorcycle combination and a truck it encountered on the way back [MASK] 
 The commander of the Tetrarch made his rep[MASK]rt , and was then ordered to take command of four Val[MASK][MASK]tines and two Tetrarchs which had recentl[MASK] arrived and once again a[MASK]tempt to breach the French defences . The tanks followed the road leading to the defen[MASK]ive line and then attempted to out @-@ flank the line b[MASK] advancing from the right @[MASK]@ hand side , using several hills as cover ; the artillery pieces were able to turn and face the assault , however , and one Valentine and one [MASK]etrarch were[MASK]hit and[MASK]destroy[MASK]d . The remaining tanks exchanged several volleys of fire with the artillery pieces before[MASK]retreating back to their original positions . The French line was[MASK]eventually broken by 29th Brigade , aided by an amphibious[MASK]assault by Royal Marines ; the remaining tanks of ' B ' Squadron , two Valentines and three Tetrarchs , remained in defensive positions until the afternoon of 6 May , coming under sporadic artillery fire which [MASK]isabled another Valentine . The squ[MASK]dron played no further part in the b[MASK]ttle , as the Vichy French authorities negotiat[MASK]d a formal sur[MASK]ender the following day , altho[MASK]gh French tr[MASK]ops would continue to engage th[MASK] [MASK]ritish occupying force in guerrilla warfare until late November . ' C ' Squadron suffered heavy cas[MASK]a[MASK]ties [MASK]uring the invasion ; only one Valentine and three Tetrarchs out[MASK]of twelve tanks were functional by 7 May , and the squadron h[MASK]d suffered seven killed and six wou[MASK]ded . It remained in Madagascar until early 1943 , when it was shipped to India and took part in the Burma Campa[MASK]gn as part of 29th Brigade .

 Beca[MASK]se of a lack of equipment t[MASK]aining facilities in [MASK]id @-@ 1940 , when the British a[MASK]rborne [MASK]stablishment was formed , the War Office was able to accept only 500 volunteers for training as airborne troops . Progress in[MASK]setting up proper training facilit[MASK]es and acquiring suitable transport aircraft [MASK]as so slow that the first British airborne operation , Op[MASK]ration Colossus , was cond[MASK]cted by a retrained Commando u[MASK]it . By 1942 , [MASK]here existed specifically trained airborne units , including [MASK]he 1st Airborne Division[MASK], an[MASK] on 19 January 1942 the War Office decided that a light tank unit w[MASK]uld be one of the support units attached to the division . This unit , de[MASK]ignated the Light Tank Squadron , was to be [MASK]ormed of nine[MASK]een light tanks and would operate to the fore of the division , using their tanks ' speed to capture objectives and then holding them until relieved by other units . The obvious unit for conversion was ' C ' Special Services Squadron , as it was trained to act as an independent t[MASK]nk u[MASK]it and , more importantly , was the only unit that was still using Tetrarchs ; it had been re @-@ [MASK]esig[MASK]ated as an[MASK]airborne tank by the [MASK]ar Office . ' C ' Squadron was of[MASK]icially transferr[MASK]d to the 1st Airborne [MASK]ivision on 24 Jun[MASK] 1942 , bringing with it seven Tetrarc[MASK]s am[MASK]ng its other veh[MASK]cles . The unit imme[MASK]iately be[MASK]an training , but was not attached to the 1st Airborne Division for long ; during mid @-@ 1943 , the[MASK]division was trans[MASK]orted to the Middle East so it coul[MASK] participate in the Allied invasion of Sicily . ' C ' Squadron remained in Britain , as not enough Hamilcar gliders had been built by the time the division departed to transport its Tetrar[MASK]hs ; the[MASK]squadron was transferred to the[MASK]6th Airborne Divis[MASK]on , which had been raised in April 1943 , and ' C ' Squadron remained with it for the rest of the conflict . [MASK]he squadron co[MASK]tinued to train a[MASK] an air @-@ portable unit , and participated[MASK]in a number of exercises to prepare for its new duti[MASK]s , including reconnaissance of enemy positions and counter @-@ attacking enemy infantry and armour . 
 On [MASK]3 December 194[MASK] , the War Office decided to expand the squadron [MASK]nto a [MASK]egiment equipped with a combination of light tanks and conventional reconnaissance vehicles such as scout cars , and on 1 Ap[MASK]il 1944 , it was re @-@ designated as the 6th Airborne Armoured Reconn[MASK]issance R[MASK]giment . The regiment consisted of a Headquarters Squadron , a Light Tank Squadron and a Reconnai[MASK]sance Squadron ; [MASK]wo Tetrar[MASK]hs , the Mark 1 CS variation , were attached to the Headquarters Squadron , but the Light[MASK]Tank Squadron , also known as ' A ' Squadron , received the majority of the Tetrarchs . ' A ' Squadron had approximately nineteen Tetrarchs split between six troops , two of which were of the CS variati[MASK]n and the rest were armed with 2 pounders fitted with Littlejohn adaptors . On 24 May 1944 , after participating in a [MASK]urther series of exercises and manoeuvres , ' A ' Squadron moved from their training area to a transit camp[MASK]at Tarrant Rushton airfield , while the rest of the regiment moved to RAF Brize Norton airfield the next day ; from these two airfields , the regiment wou[MASK]d be transported from to [MASK]articipate in the British airborne landings in Normandy . The operation began on the nig[MASK]t of 5 June , with the deployment of 6th Airborn[MASK] D[MASK]vision to eastern Normandy . It was tasked with protecting the eastern flank of the Allied seaborne [MASK]andings , securing strat[MASK]gically important areas east of Caen , capturing several important bridges over the Cae[MASK] Canal and River Dives , and destroying a coastal artillery battery . Insufficie[MASK]t transport aircraft were available to land all three of the division 's brigades[MASK]simultaneously ; one would have to be landed in a se[MASK]ond lift later in the day . Major[MASK]General Richard Gale had initially intended for the 6th Airlanding Brigade , to which the 6th Airborne Armoured Reco[MASK]naissanc[MASK] Regiment was attached , to be landed first ; however , aerial photography revealed that anti @-@ glider poles had been erect[MASK]d in the landing zo[MASK]e selected for the brigade . Therefore , Gale decided that t[MASK]e 3rd Parachute Brigade and 5th Parachute Brigade ( which did not utilise[MASK][MASK]liders ) should land in the first lift to clear the landing zones , allowing the 6th Airlanding Brigade to land in the second lift . [MASK] The Horsa and Hamilcar gliders of the brigade landed at 21 : 00 on 6 June in a landin[MASK] zone cleared of obstructions by the 5th Parachute Brigade . The primary tasks of the brigade were to bring in reinforcements and supplies , and to aid the two parachute brigades in consolidating [MASK]he area[MASK]held by the divisi[MASK]n ; the 6th Airborne Armoured Reconnaissance Squ[MASK]dron w[MASK]s to aid in the latter task , acting as a reconnaissance force to scout out German positions and impede the movement of German forces attempting t[MASK] counter @-@ attack . T[MASK]e Tetrarchs of '[MASK]A ' Squadron were to play an integral part in this reconnaissance role due to their speed , but the squadron 's strength of twenty tank[MASK] [MASK]as severely depleted by the time [MASK]t landed in Normandy . It lost one tank before the formation landed when the Tetrarch broke loose of its sh[MASK]ckles and crashed through t[MASK]e nose of the glide[MASK] that was ca[MASK]rying it , causing both to fall into the sea mid @-@ flight . The s[MASK]uadron 's st[MASK]ength was f[MASK]rther weaken[MASK]d when [MASK]wo gliders[MASK]collided with each other in the landing zone , destroying themselves and the Tetrarchs they carried ; a third Ha[MASK]ilcar hit another Tetrarch as it was be[MASK]ng unloaded and flipped the t[MASK]n[MASK] upside down , rendering it u[MASK]usa[MASK]le , although the crew escaped without injury . The survivin[MASK] tanks were then rendered temporarily immobile when [MASK]a[MASK]achute rigging lines became tangled in thei[MASK] suspens[MASK]ons , forcin[MASK] t[MASK]eir crews to cut the lines away with welding torches . 
 The [MASK]quadron retrieved all of the remaining Tetrarchs and advanced to t[MASK]e south of the landing zone[MASK]to lin[MASK] up with th[MASK] rest of the regiment ; there , they [MASK]eceived ord[MASK]rs to support the 8th Parachute Battalion in the Bois de Bavent area and conduct reconnaissance duties . Afte[MASK] linking with the battalion , the squadron began reconnoitring , and engaged Ger[MASK]an infantry and armour they encountere[MASK][MASK]. By the end of 7 June , two [MASK]etrarchs had been lost to enemy action , one destroyed by a G[MASK]rman self @-@ propelled gun[MASK]and the second by hitting a mine . The division was reinforced by Britis[MASK] troops who were ad[MASK]ancing from the invasion beaches and it began to push through Normandy , while the squadron continued its reconnaissance duties . At thi[MASK] time , Gale decided to avoid , when possible , engaging the Tetra[MASK]chs with German armour , as[MASK]they[MASK]proved[MASK]to be completely out[MASK]lassed by the German tanks and self @-@ propelled guns , such as the Panzer IV a[MASK]d the Sturmgeschütz III . Instead , when th[MASK] division required ar[MASK]oured support , it summoned it from armoured units outside the division , and the Tetrarchs were used to support infantry patrols and provide fire support . By August , in the divisio[MASK] 's pre[MASK]aration for th[MASK] planned breakout[MASK]from the Normandy bridgehead , the majority of Tetrarchs in ' A ' Squadron were replaced with Cromwell fast cruiser tanks ; only three Tetrarchs remained , ass[MASK]gned to the Headquarter[MASK] troop of ' A '[MASK]Squadron .

 Operation Tonga was the last that Tetrarch[MASK] saw of active combat . During the first week of October 1944 , the 6th Airborne Armoured Reconnaissance Regiment underwent an extensive reorganization , i[MASK] which it was c[MASK]mpletely restructured , [MASK]nd all the remaining Tetrarchs were retired . Th[MASK]y were replaced with the M22 Locust , a purpose @-@ built airborne[MASK]light tank of American design ; eight Locusts were [MASK]sed by the regiment in March [MASK]945 during Operation [MASK]arsity , the airborne[MASK]operation to cross the river Rhine . A repor[MASK] issued[MASK]by the Director ( Air ) of the War Office in January 1946 confirmed that the Tetrarch design was considered obsolete , and any light tanks used in p[MASK]st @-@ wa[MASK] airborne formations w[MASK]uld be entire[MASK]y new in design . A small number of Tetrarchs re[MASK]ai[MASK]ed in service with the 3rd Hussars until 1949 ; a Hamilcar glider flight was st[MASK]ti[MASK]ned at RAF Fairford , and a troop of Tetrarchs was kept by the r[MASK]giment for training exercises wit[MASK] the gliders . However , glide[MASK] training by the regiment was stopped in 1950 and the Tetrarchs withdrawn fr[MASK]m service .

 There were several variants of the Tetrarch design . The first was the Light Ta[MASK]k Mk VIII[MASK], Vickers @-@ Armstrong [MASK]s pr[MASK]posed su[MASK]c[MASK]ssor to the Tetrarch . The Mark VIII was also known as the Harry Hopkins , named after Pre[MASK]ident Roosevelt 's chief diplomatic advisor[MASK], and was given the General Staff design num[MASK][MASK]r A25 b[MASK] the Wa[MASK] Office . The Mark VIII was intended to improve upon the design of the Tetrarch in a number of areas . It had thicker armour than the Tetrarch , with the front hull and tur[MASK]et armour increas[MASK]d to a thickness of 38 milli[MASK]etres ( 1 @.@ 5 in ) and the si[MASK]e armour[MASK]to 17 millimetres ( 0 @.@ 67 in ) , and the turret and hull given more sloped[MASK]surfaces to help de[MASK]lect shells fired at the ta[MASK]k . The dimensions of the Tetrarch were also changed ; the Mark VIII was longer by 6 inches ( 0 @.@ 15 m ) , wider by 1 f[MASK]ot 3 inches ( 0 @.@ 38 m ) and heavier . The new tank was no longer air @-@ portable , as it was too heavy to be carried by a Hamilcar . The 12 @-@ cylinder engine of the Tetrarch was fitted to the [MASK]ark VIII , although the increased weight meant that[MASK]its maximum speed decreased to 30 miles per hour ( 48 km / h ) ; its arma[MASK]ent also remained t[MASK]e sa[MASK]e as that of the Tetrarch . The War Off[MASK]ce authorised the construction of three prototype models in April 1941[MASK]. The new de[MASK]ign was considered a success , and the Tank Board of the War Office ordered 1 @,@ 000 to be co[MASK]structed in Septemb[MASK][MASK] . However , problems were encountered with further tests[MASK]of the prototypes , and a report i[MASK]sued in December 1942 stated that production of the Mark VIII had been delayed due to developmental problems . These problems continued to persist[MASK]into 1943 , when the War Office decided against using the tank[MASK]in a[MASK]tive service ; approximately 100 Mark VIIIs were p[MASK]oduced by 1945 , w[MASK]en p[MASK]oduction ended . 
[MASK]A second variant on the Tetrarch design was the Tetrarch Duplex Drive ( " Tetrarch [MASK]D " ) . The Duplex Drive system was invented by Nicholas Straussler [MASK] and was designed to allow a tan[MASK] [MASK]o ' swim ' through water and participate in amphibious operations . T[MASK]e system functioned by erecting a large waterproof[MASK]canvas screen around the tank above its tracks , which was supported[MASK]by thirty @-@ six i[MASK][MASK]latable tubes and steel struts ; this gave the tank sufficient buoyancy to float , and was t[MASK]en propelled along by a small propeller powered by the tank 's engine . The screen could be collapsed by using a small explosive charge once the tank reached land . The system was fitted during June 1941 , as the Tetrarch [MASK]as the lightest light tank available at the ti[MASK]e ; the converted tank was su[MASK]cessfully tested on a number of lakes and reservoirs , allowing the Duplex Drive system to be tested on heavier tanks , such as the Vale[MASK]tine . The system [MASK]ould be used during Operation Overlord , when M4 Sherman[MASK]medium tanks would land on the invasion beaches .

 The player , as Donald , ventures throug[MASK] a varie[MASK]y of side @-@ scrolling levels . Generally , each level is divided into an overland pa[MASK]t and a dungeon , such as the Maharaj[MASK]h 's palace or the temple in w[MASK]ich the Great Duck Tr[MASK]asure resides . A[MASK]though the player may choose any order to play the overland sections , various obstacles prevent the player from entering the du[MASK]g[MASK]ons outside of a specific order . In addition to this , some levels provide the player with vital clues which solve puzzles needed to progress in later sections . Once Donald has completed the overland section of an area , he [MASK]ay leave by calli[MASK]g his nephews ' bi[MASK]lane , and w[MASK]ll return to the dungeon entrance of that area if the player chooses to return . 
 Donald is armed with a special gun that can shoot plungers , popcorn or bubble [MASK]um . Donald has unlimited plungers which can only temporarily stun enemies ( though bosses can still be damaged with [MASK]lungers ) , and can collect popcorn and gum along the way or get the latter from Gyro Gearloose . Later in the game , the plunger [MASK]s upgraded to act as a temporary platform to climb walls with and , when stuck to a passing bird , allows Donald to tr[MASK]verse longer distances .

 While Donald is flipping through some books in Scrooge McDuck 's library , a map falls out of a book relating to the treasure of King Garuzia , ruler of the Great Duck Kingd[MASK]m in [MASK]ncient times .[MASK]The map leads to the locat[MASK]on of th[MASK] king 's [MASK]ost prized possession , hidden in a secret place shortly before his de[MASK]th . Donald thinks th[MASK]s is his path to rich[MASK]s [MASK] Unfortunately Big Bad Pete overhears and p[MASK]rsues Donald[MASK]throughout the game hoping to steal the treasure . 
 [MASK]eamed with his nephews Huey , Dewey , an[MASK] Louie , and using[MASK]the partial map from the library , Donald begins his search in Duckbu[MASK]g , with the trail being directed to an Aztec pyramid in Mexico . Outside the pyramid , he is directed by a " sweet seniorita " to obtain a " hero key[MASK]" from an explore[MASK] back in Duckburg to open the pyramid . Inside the py[MASK]amid ,[MASK]Donald meets Goofy , who gives him a strange note and a plunger to[MASK]help him reach higher places , and tells him that Gyro Gearloose is looking for[MASK]him back in Duckburg .[MASK]Travelling across the rooftops of Duckbur[MASK] to meet Gyro , Donald is given Gyro 's latest invent[MASK]on , bubblegum ammo that can break through walls . The last location on t[MASK]e partial map is Count Dracula 's castle in Transylvania , where Donald encounters a ghost who tells him that the Count carries the real treasure map . 
 After defeating Dracula , Donald receives a more complete map . I[MASK] India , [MASK]onald enters the palace of [MASK]he Maharajah , where she challenges him to defeat the tiger in her [MASK]arden in e[MASK]chan[MASK]e for a Sphinx Tear .

Donald is able to solve[MASK]the " Riddle of the Sphinx [MASK] using the note[MASK]Goofy had given him , and obtains the Scepter of Ra bef[MASK]re escaping in a mine cart . From there , he journeys to th[MASK] South Pole , where he finds a key frozen in ice , and [MASK]s[MASK][MASK] the Scepter of Ra to melt the ice and grab the key . The key unlocks the hold of a Viking ship , which contains an ancient di[MASK]ry with the sec[MASK]et to locating the treasure . The ship is haunted by ghosts , and the Viking captain sends Donald below decks to get rid of them . After defeating a skeletal Viking war[MASK]ior , Donald returns to the deck , where the captain informs him that the diary is hidden in ice nea[MASK] the South Pole , [MASK]nd gives him an " ancient Viking[MASK]plunger [MASK] that attaches to flying creatures .

 = Olmec colossal heads = 
 [MASK] The Olmec[MASK]colossal heads are at least sev[MASK]nteen monumental stone representations of human heads sculpted from large basalt boulders . The heads date from at least before 900 BC and are a distinctive feature of t[MASK]e O[MASK]mec civilization of ancient Mesoamerica . All portray mature men with fleshy cheeks , flat noses , and slightly crossed eyes ; their physical characteristics correspond to a type that is [MASK]till common among the inhabitants of Tabasco and Veracruz . The backs of the monuments often are flat . The bo[MASK]lders were brought from the Sierra de los Tuxtlas mountains of Veracruz . Given that the extremely large slabs[MASK]of stone used in their production were transported [MASK]ver large distances , requiring a great d[MASK]al of human effort and resources , it is thought that the monuments repre[MASK]ent portraits of pow[MASK]rful individual Olmec rulers . Each of the know[MASK] examples has a distinctive headdress . The heads[MASK]were variously arran[MASK]ed in l[MASK]nes or groups at major Olmec centres , but the method and logistics used to transport the ston[MASK] to these sites remain[MASK]unclear . 
 The discovery of a colossal head at Tres Zapotes in th[MASK] nineteenth c[MASK]ntury spurred the first archaeological invest[MASK]gations of Olmec culture by Matthew Stirl[MASK]ng in 1938 .[MASK]Seventeen confirmed examples are known from four sites within t[MASK]e Olmec he[MASK]rtland on the Gulf Coast [MASK]f Mexico . Most colossal head[MASK] were sculpted from spherical boulders but two from San Lorenzo[MASK]Tenochtitlán were re @-@ carved from massive stone thrones . An additional [MASK]o[MASK]ument , at Takalik Abaj in Guatemala , is a throne that m[MASK]y have been carve[MASK] fr[MASK]m a colossal head . This is the on[MASK]y known[MASK]example [MASK]rom outside the Olmec heartland . 
 Dating the monuments remains difficult becau[MASK]e of the movement [MASK]f many from their origin[MASK]l contexts prior to archaeological investigation . Most have been dated to the Early Preclassic period ( 1500 – 1000 BC ) with[MASK]some to the Middle Preclas[MASK]ic ( 1000 – 400 BC ) period . The smallest weigh 6 tons , while the largest is variously estimated to weigh 40 to 50 to[MASK]s , [MASK]lthough it was abandoned and left unfinished close to the source of its sto[MASK]e . 
 
 = = Olmec civilization = = 
 
 The Olmec civilizati[MASK]n developed in the lowlands of sout[MASK]eastern Mexico between 1[MASK]00 and 400 BC . The Olmec heartland lies on the Gulf Coast of Mexico within[MASK]the states of Veracruz a[MASK]d Tabasco , an area measuring appr[MASK]xi[MASK]ately 275 kilometres ( 171 mi ) east to west and extending about 100 kilometres ( 62 mi ) inland from[MASK]the coast . The Olmecs a[MASK]e regarded as the first civilization to develop in Mesoamerica and the Olmec heartland is one of six cradles of civilization [MASK]orldwide , the [MASK]thers being th[MASK] Norte Chico culture of South America , the Erlitou culture of China 's Yellow River[MASK], the In[MASK]us Valley Civilization of south Asia , the civilization of ancient Egypt and the Sumerian civilization of an[MASK]ient Iraq . Of these , only the Olmec civilization developed in a lowland tropical forest setting . 
 The Olmecs were [MASK]he f[MASK]rst inhabitants of the Americas to construct monumental architecture and [MASK]o settle in towns and cities . They were also the first people in[MASK]the Americas to develop a sophisticated style[MASK]of stone sculpture . In the first decade of th[MASK] 21st century evidence emerged of Olmec writin[MASK] , with the earliest examples of O[MASK][MASK]ec hieroglyphs dating to around 650 BC [MASK] Examples of script [MASK]ave bee[MASK] found on ro[MASK]ler stamps and stone artefacts ; the texts are short and have been[MASK]partially deciphered based on their similarity to o[MASK]her Mesoamerican scripts . The evidence of compl[MASK]x society developing in the Olmec heartland has led [MASK]o the Olmecs being regarded as the " Mother Culture " of [MASK]esoameric[MASK] , although this concept remains controversial . 
 Some of the Olmecs ' rulers seem to have served religious functions . The city of San Lorenzo was succeeded as the main centre of the civilization by La Venta in about 900 BC , with [MASK]res Z[MASK]potes and Laguna de los Cerros po[MASK]sibly sh[MASK]ring the role ; other urban centres were much less significant . The nature and degree of the control exercised by the centres over a widespread rural population[MASK]remains unclear . Very fine Olmec art , much clearly made for an elite , survives in [MASK]everal forms , notably Olmec f[MASK]gurines , and larger sculptures such as The Wrestler . The figurines have been recovered in large numbers and are mostly in potter[MASK] ; these[MASK]were presumably widely available to the population . Together with these , of particular relevance to the colossal heads are the " Olmec @[MASK]@ style masks " in stone , so [MASK]all[MASK]d because none have yet been e[MASK]cavated in circumstances that allow the proper archaeological ide[MASK]ti[MASK]ication of an Olmec context . These evocative stone face masks present both similarities[MASK]and differences [MASK]o the colossal hea[MASK]s . Two thirds [MASK]f Olmec monumental sculpture represents the human for[MASK] , and the colossal heads fall within this maj[MASK]r theme of Olmec art . 
 
 = = Dating = = 
 
 The colossal heads cannot be precise[MASK]y dated . However , the San Lorenzo[MASK]heads w[MASK]re buried by 900 BC , indicating th[MASK]t their[MASK]period of manufacture and use was earlier still . The heads from Tres Zapotes had been moved from their original context before they wer[MASK] investigated by archaeol[MASK]gists and the heads from La Venta were found partially exposed on the modern ground surface . The period of production of the colossal heads is therefore unknown , as is whet[MASK]er it spanned a century or a millennium . Estimates of the time span during which colossal heads were produced vary from 50 to 200 years . The San Lore[MASK]zo heads are[MASK]believed to [MASK]e th[MASK] oldest , and are the most skillfully executed . All of the stone heads have been assigned to the Preclassic period of Meso[MASK]merican chronology , generally to th[MASK] Early Preclassic ( 1500 – 1000 BC ) , although[MASK]the two Tres Za[MASK]otes head[MASK] and the La Cobata Head are attributed to the Middle [MASK]reclassic ( 1000 – 400[MASK]BC ) .

 Olmec colossal heads vary in height from 1 [MASK].[MASK] 47 to 3 @.@ 4 metres ( 4 @.@[MASK]8 to 11 @.[MASK] 2 ft ) and weigh between 6 and 50 tons . All o[MASK] the Olmec col[MASK]ssal heads depict mature men with flat noses and fleshy cheeks ; the eyes tend to be slightly crossed . The general physical characteristics of the heads are of a type that is still common among people in the Olmec region in modern times . The backs of the heads are o[MASK][MASK]en flat , as if the monuments w[MASK]re originally placed against a wall . A[MASK]l examples[MASK]of Olmec colossal heads wear distinctive headdresses that probably represent cloth or animal hide originals . S[MASK]me examples have a tied knot at the back of the head , and some[MASK]are decorated with feathers [MASK] A head from La Venta is decorated with the head of a bird . There are similarities betwe[MASK]n the headdress[MASK]s on some of the heads that has led to speculation that specific headdresses may represent dif[MASK]erent dynasties , or perhaps identify specific rulers . Most of the heads wear large earspools inserted i[MASK]to the ear lobes . 
 All of[MASK]the heads are realistic ,[MASK]unidealised and frank descripti[MASK]ns of the men . It is likely that they were portraits of living ( or recently deceased ) rule[MASK]s well known to [MASK]he[MASK]sculptors . Each head is distinct and naturalistic , displaying individualised featur[MASK]s . They were once tho[MASK]ght to represent ballplayers [MASK]lth[MASK]ugh[MASK]this t[MASK]eory is no longer widely held ; it is possible , howeve[MASK] , that they represent rulers equippe[MASK] for the Mesoamerican ballgame . Facial expressions depicted on the heads vary from ste[MASK]n through placid to smiling . The most naturalistic Olmec art is the earliest [MASK] [MASK][MASK]pearing suddenly witho[MASK]t surviving antecedents , with a tendency towards more stylised sculpture as time progressed . Some surviving examples of wooden s[MASK]ulpture recovered from El Ma[MASK]atí demonstrate that the Olmecs are likely to have created many more perishable sculptures than works sculpted from stone . 
 In the [MASK]ate nineteenth century , José Melgar y Serrano described a colossal head[MASK]as having "[MASK]Ethiopian " features and [MASK]peculations that the [MASK]lmec had African origin[MASK] resurfaced in 1960 in the work of Alfonso M[MASK]dellín Zenil and in the 1970s in the[MASK]writings of Ivan van Sert[MASK]ma . Such speculation is not taken seriously by Mesoamerican scholars such as Richard[MASK]Diehl and Ann Cyphers . 
 Although all the colossal heads are broadly similar [MASK] there [MASK]re distinct stylistic differences in their execution . One of the heads from San Lorenzo bears traces [MASK]f plaster and red pa[MASK]nt [MASK] suggesting that the heads were [MASK]riginally brightly decorated . Heads did not just represent individual Olmec rulers ; they also incorporated the very concept of rulership itself . 
 
 = = Manufacture = = 
 
 The production of each colossal head[MASK]must[MASK][MASK]ave been carefully planned , given the e[MASK]for[MASK] required to ensure the nece[MASK]sary resources were [MASK]vailable ; it seems likely that only the more powerful Olmec rulers were able to mobilise such resourc[MASK]s . The workforce would have included sculptors , labourers[MASK], overseers , boatmen , woodworkers and other artesans producing [MASK]he tools to make and mo[MASK]e the monument , in addition to the[MASK]support needed to fee[MASK][MASK]and otherwise at[MASK]end to these workers . The seasonal and agricultural cycles and river levels needed [MASK]o have been taken into account to plan the production of the monu[MASK]ent and the whole project m[MASK]y well have taken years from beginning to end . 
 Archaeological investig[MASK]t[MASK]on of Olmec basalt workshops suggest that the colossal heads were first roughly shaped [MASK]sing direct percussion to c[MASK]i[MASK] away both large and small flakes of stone . The sculpture was then refined by retouching the surface using hammerstones , which were generally rounded cobbles that could be of the same basalt as the monument itself , although this was not always the[MASK]case . Abrasives were found [MASK]n a[MASK]sociation with workshops at San Lorenzo , indicating their use in the finishing of fine detail . Olmec[MASK]colossal heads were fashioned as in @-@ the @-@ round monumen[MASK]s wit[MASK] varying levels of relief on the same work ; they tended to feature higher relief on the face [MASK]nd lower relief on the earspools and headdresses . Monument 20 at San Lorenzo is an extensively damaged throne with a figure emerging from a niche[MASK]. Its sides were broken [MASK]way and it was dragg[MASK]d to another location before being abandoned . It is possible that this damage was caused by the initial stages of re @-@ carving the monument into a colossal head but that the work was never completed . 
 All seventeen of the confirmed heads in the Ol[MASK]ec heartland w[MASK]re sculpted from basalt mined in the Sierra de los Tuxtlas moun[MASK]ains[MASK]of Veracruz . Most were fo[MASK]med [MASK]rom coarse grained dark gr[MASK]y basalt known as Cerro Cintepec basalt af[MASK]er a volcano in the range . Investigators have proposed that large Cerro Cintepec basalt boulders found on the southeastern s[MASK]opes of the mountains are the so[MASK]rce of the stone for the monuments . These boul[MASK]ers are found in an area affected by large lahars ( volcanic mudslides ) that carried substantial blocks of stone dow[MASK] [MASK]he mo[MASK]ntain slopes , whi[MASK]h suggests [MASK]hat the Olmecs did not need to quarry the raw material for [MASK]culpting the heads . Roughly spherical boulders were carefully sel[MASK]cted to mimic the sh[MASK]pe of a human head . [MASK]he stone for the San Lorenzo and La Venta heads [MASK]as transported a considerable distance from the source . The La Cobata head was [MASK]ound on El Vigia hil[MASK] in the Sierra de los Tuxtlas and the stone from Tres Zapotes Colossal Head 1 and Nestepe Colossal Head 1 ( also known as Tres Zapot[MASK]s Monuments A and Q ) came from the same hill . 
 The boulders were transported over 150 kilometres ( 93 mi ) from the source of the stone . The e[MASK][MASK]ct method of transportati[MASK]n of such large masses of rock are unknown , especially since the Olmecs lac[MASK]ed beasts of burden and functio[MASK]al wheels , and they were likely[MASK]to have use[MASK] water transport whenever possible . Coastal currents of the Gulf of Mexico and in river estuaries might have made the waterborne transport of monuments wei[MASK]hing 20 [MASK]ons or more impractical . Two badly damaged Olmec sculptures depict rectangular stone blocks bound with ropes . A largely destroyed human figure rides [MASK]pon each block , with their legs hanging over the side . These sculptures may well d[MASK]pict Olmec[MASK]rulers overseeing the transport of the st[MASK]ne that would be fashioned into their monuments . When transport over land was necessary , the Olmecs are likely to have used causeways , ramps and roads to facilitate moving the heads . The regional terrain offers significant obstacles such as swamps and floodplains ; avoiding these would have necessitated crossing undulating hill country . The construction of temporary causeways using th[MASK] suitable an[MASK] plentiful flood[MASK]lain soils would have allowe[MASK] a direct route across the floodplains to the San Lorenzo Plateau . Earth structures such as mounds , platforms and causeways upon the plateau demonstrate that the Olmec possessed the necessary knowledg[MASK] and could commit the resources to build large @-@ scale [MASK]arthwo[MASK]ks . 
 The flat backs of man[MASK] of the colossal heads represented the [MASK]la[MASK] bases of the mon[MASK]mental thrones from whic[MASK] they were reworked . Only four of the seventeen heartland heads do not have flattened backs , indicatin[MASK] the possibility that the majority were reworked monuments . Alternatively , the backs of many of these massive monuments may have been flattened to ease their transport , providing a st[MASK]ble form for hauling the monuments with rope[MASK] . Two h[MASK]ads from San Lorenzo have traces of niches that are characteristic of monumental Ol[MASK]ec thrones and so were definitely reworked from earlier monuments .[MASK]

 Seventeen confirmed examples are known . An additional monument , at Takalik Ab[MASK]j in Guat[MASK]mala , is a throne that may have been carved[MASK]from a colossal head . This is the only known example outside of[MASK]the Olmec heartland on the Gulf Coast of Mexico . Possible fragments of additional colossa[MASK] heads have been recovered at San Lorenzo and at San Fernando in Tabasco . Crude colossal stone heads are also known in the Southern Maya area where they are associated with the potbelly style of sculpture . Although some arguments have been made that they are pre @-@ Olmec , the[MASK]e latter monuments are generally believ[MASK]d to be influenced by the Olmec style of sculpture .

 The ten colossal heads from San Lorenzo or[MASK]gi[MASK]ally formed two roughly parallel lines running north @-@ sout[MASK] across the site . Although some were recovered from ravines , they were found c[MASK]ose to their original placements[MASK]and had been buried by local erosion . These heads , toget[MASK]er with a number of monumental stone thrones , probably formed a processional route across the site , powerful[MASK]y displaying its dynastic history . Two of the San Lorenzo heads had been re @-@ carved from older thrones . 
 San Lorenzo Colossal Head 1 ( also known as San Lorenzo Monument 1 [MASK] wa[MASK] lying facing upwards when excavated . The erosion of a path passing on top of the monument uncovered its e[MASK]e and led to the discovery o[MASK] the Olmec site . Colossal Head 1 is 2 @.@ 84 metres ( 9 @.@ 3 ft ) high ; it measures 2 @.@ 11 metres ( 6 @.@ 9 ft ) wide a[MASK]d it weighs 25 @.@ 3 tons . The monument was discovered partially buried at the e[MASK]ge of a gull[MASK] by Matthew Stirling in 1945 . When dis[MASK]overed it was lying on its back , looking upwards . It was associated with a large number of broken cera[MASK]ic v[MASK]ssels and figu[MASK]ines . The[MASK]majority of these ceramic rema[MASK]ns have been dated to between [MASK]00 and 400[MASK]BC ; some pieces have been dated to the Vill[MASK] Alta phase ( Late Classic period , 800 – 1000 AD ) . The headdress possesses a plain band that is tied at the back of the head . [MASK]he upper portion of the headdress is de[MASK]orated with a U @-@ shaped motif [MASK] This element descends across the front of the headdress , terminating on the forehead . On the front portion it is decorated with five semicircular motifs . The scalp piece does not meet th[MASK] horizontal band[MASK], leaving a space between the two pieces . On each side of[MASK]the face a strap descends from the headdress and passes in front of the ear . The forehead is wrinkled in a frown . The li[MASK]s are slightly parted without[MASK]revealing t[MASK]e teeth . The cheeks are pronounced and [MASK]he ears are particularly well e[MASK]ec[MASK]ted . The face is slightly asymm[MASK]tric , which may be due to error on the part of the sculptors or may accurately reflect the physical features of the portrai[MASK] 's s[MASK]bject . The head has been moved to the Museo de Antropología de Xalapa [MASK] " Anthropological Museum of Xalapa " ) . 
 San Lorenzo Colossal Head 2 ( [MASK]lso known [MASK]s San Lorenzo Monument 2 ) was reworked from a monumental throne . The [MASK]ead stands 2 @.@ 69 metres ( [MASK] @.@ 8 ft ) high and measures 1 @.@ 83 metres ( 6 @.@ 0 ft ) wide by 1 @.@ 05 me[MASK]res ( 3 @.@ 4 ft ) deep ; it weighs 20 tons . Colossal Head 2 w[MASK]s discovered in 1945 when Matthew Stirling 's guide cleared away some of the vegetation and mud that covered it . The monument was found lying on its back ,[MASK]facing the sky , and was excavated i[MASK] 1946 [MASK]y Stirling and Philip Drucker . In 1962 the mon[MASK]ment was removed from the San Lorenzo plat[MASK]au in order to put it on display as part of " The Olmec tradition " exhibition at the Museum of Fine Arts in Houston in 1963 . San Lorenzo Colossal Head[MASK]2 is currently in the Museo Nacional de Antropología in Mexico City . The head was associated with a n[MASK]mber of ceramic finds ; they have been dated to the Early Preclassic and La[MASK]e Classi[MASK] periods . Colossal Head 2 wears a complex headdress that sports a horizontal band tied at the back of the head ; this is decorated with thre[MASK] bird 's heads that are located above the forehead and temple[MASK][MASK].[MASK]The scalp piece is formed from six strips running towards the back of the head . The f[MASK]ont of the headdress above the horizo[MASK]tal band is plain . Two short straps hang down from the headdress in front of the ears [MASK] The ear jewellery i[MASK] f[MASK]rmed by la[MASK]ge squared ho[MASK]ps or[MASK]frame[MASK] [MASK]iscs . The lef[MASK] and right ornaments are di[MASK]ferent , with radial lines on the left earflare , a feature absent[MASK]on the [MASK]ight earflare . The head is badly damaged due to an unfinished reworking process . This process has pitmarked the entire face with at least 60 smaller hollows and 2[MASK]larger holes . The surviving feat[MASK]res appear t[MASK] depict an ageing man [MASK]ith the forehead creased into a frown . Th[MASK] lips are thick and slightly parted to reveal the teeth ; the head has a pronounced chin . 
 San Lorenzo Colossal Head 3 is also known[MASK]as San Lorenzo Monument 3 . The head measures 1 @.@[MASK]78 metres ( 5 @.@ 8 ft ) high by 1 @.@ 63 metres ( 5 @.@ 3 ft ) wide by 0 @.@ 95 metres ( 3 @.@ 1 ft ) deep and we[MASK]ghs 9 @.@ 4 tons . Th[MASK] head was discovered in a deep gully by Matthew Stirling in[MASK]1946 ;[MASK]it was found lying face down and its excavation was difficult due to the wet conditions in the gully . The monument was found 0 @.@ 8 kilometres ( 0 @.@ 50 mi ) southwest of the main mound at San Lorenzo , however , its original location is unknown ; erosion of the gully may have resulted in significant movement of the sculpture . Head 3 has been moved to the Museo de Antro[MASK]ología de Xalapa . The headdr[MASK]ss is complex , with the horizontal [MASK]asal band being formed by four horizontal cords , with diagonal folds above each eye . A small skullcap tops the headdress . A large flap formed of four cords drops down both sides of the head , completely covering the ears[MASK]. The face has a typica[MASK]ly frowning brow and , unusually , has[MASK]clearly defined eyelids . The lips are thick[MASK]and slightly parted ; the front o[MASK] the lower lip has broken away complete[MASK]y , and the lower front of the headdress is pitted with 27 irregularly spaced artificial [MASK]epressions . 
 San Lorenzo Colossal [MASK]e[MASK]d 4 ( also known as San Lorenzo Monument 4 ) weighs 6 tons and has been mov[MASK]d to the Museo de Antropología de Xalapa . Colossal Head [MASK] is 1 @.@ 78 metres ( 5 @.@ 8 ft ) high , 1 @.@ [MASK]7 met[MASK]es ( 3 @.@ 8 ft[MASK]) wide and 0 @.@ 95 metres ( 3 @.@ 1 ft ) deep . The h[MASK]ad was discovered by Matthew Stirling in 1946 , 550 metres ( 600 yd ) northwest of the principal mound , at the edge of a gully . When excavated , it was found to[MASK]be lying on its right @-@ hand side and in [MASK] very [MASK]ood state of preservation . Ceramic ma[MASK]erials excava[MASK]ed with the head became mixed with ceramics associated with Head 5 , making ceramic dating of the monument difficult . The headdress is decorated with a horizontal band formed [MASK]f[MASK]four sculpted cords , sim[MASK]lar to those of Hea[MASK] 3 . On the right @-@ hand s[MASK]de , three tassels descend from the uppe[MASK] portion of the headdress ; they ter[MASK]inate in a total of eight strips that ha[MASK]g down across the horizontal band . These tassels are judged to represent hair rather than cords . Also on the right hand side , two cords descend across the ear and continue to the base of the monument . On the left @-@ hand side , t[MASK]ree v[MASK]rtical c[MASK]rds descend across the ear . The earfla[MASK]e is only visible on the right hand side ; [MASK]t is formed of a plain disc and peg . The face is that of an[MASK]ageing man with a creas[MASK]d forehead , low cheekbones and a prominent chin . The lips are thick and slightly parted . 
 San Lorenzo Colossal Head 5 is al[MASK]o known as San Lorenzo Monument 5 . The monument stands 1 @.@ 86 m[MASK]tres[MASK]([MASK]6 @.@ 1 ft )[MASK]high a[MASK]d meas[MASK]res 1 @.@ 4[MASK] metres ( 4 @.@ 8 ft ) wide b[MASK] 1 @.@ 15 metre[MASK] ( 3 @.[MASK] 8 ft ) deep . It weighs 11 @.@ 6 tons . The head was discovered by Matthew Stirling in 1946 , face down in a gully to the south of the [MASK]rincipal mound . The head is pa[MASK]ticu[MASK]arly well executed and is likely to have been found close to its original locati[MASK]n .[MASK]Ceramics r[MASK]covered[MASK]during its excav[MASK]tion became mixed with those from the excavation of Head 4 . The mixed ceramics have been dated to the San Lorenzo and[MASK]Villa Alta phases ( approximately 1400 – 1000 BC and 800 – 1000 AD respectively ) [MASK] Colossal Head 5 is particularly well preserved , although the back of the headd[MASK]ess band was damaged when the head was moved from the archaeological site . The band of[MASK]the headdr[MASK]ss is set at an angle and has a notch above the bridge of the nose . The headdress is decorated with ja[MASK]uar paws ; this general identification of the decorati[MASK]n is contested by Beatriz de la Fuente since [MASK]he " paws " have three claws each ; she ide[MASK]tifies them as the claws of a bird[MASK]of prey . At the back of th[MASK] head , ten interlaced strips form a net decorated with disc motifs . T[MASK]o short straps descend from the h[MASK]address in front of th[MASK] ears . The ear[MASK] are adorned with disc @-[MASK] shaped earspools w[MASK]th pegs . The face is that of an ageing man wit[MASK] wrinkles under the eyes a[MASK]d across the bridge of the [MASK]os[MASK] , and a fore[MASK]ead that is creased in a fr[MASK]wn . The lips are sligh[MASK]ly parted . Colossal Head 5 has been moved[MASK]t[MASK] [MASK]he Museo de Antropología de Xalapa . 
 San Lorenzo Col[MASK]ssal Head 6 ( also known as San Lorenzo Mon[MASK]ment 17 ) is one[MASK]of the smaller examples of colossal heads , standing 1 @.@ 67 metres ( 5 @.@ 5 f[MASK] ) . It measures 1 @.@ 41 metr[MASK]s ( 4 [MASK].@ 6 ft ) wide by 1 @.@ 26 metres ( 4 @.@ 1 ft ) deep and is estimated to weigh betwe[MASK]n 8 and 10 tons . The head was discovered by a local farmworker and was excavated in 1965 by Luis Aveleyra and Román Piña Chan . The head had collapsed into a ravine under its own w[MASK]ight and was found face down on its[MASK]left hand side . In 1970 it was transported t[MASK] the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York for the museum 's centenar[MASK] exhibitio[MASK] . After its return to Mexico , it was placed in the Mu[MASK]eo Nacional de Antropolo[MASK]ía in Mexico C[MASK]ty . It is sculp[MASK]ed with a net @-@ like head covering joined together with sculpted beads . A covering [MASK]escends from under the headdress to cover[MASK]the back half of the neck . The headband is divided into four strips and begins ab[MASK]ve the right ear , extending around the entire head . A short strap descends from either s[MASK]de o[MASK] the h[MASK]ad to the ear . The ear ornamen[MASK]s are complex and are larger at the fr[MASK]nt of the ear[MASK]tha[MASK] at the back . Th[MASK] face is th[MASK]t of an ageing male with the forehead creased in a f[MASK]own , wrinkles under the eyes[MASK], sagging cheeks[MASK]and d[MASK]ep creases on either side of the nose . Th[MASK] face is somewhat asymmetric , possibl[MASK] due to errors in the execution of the monument[MASK]. 
 San Lorenzo Colossal Head 7 ( also known as San Lorenzo Monument 53 ) measures 2 @.@ 7 metres ( 8 @.@ 9 ft ) high by 1 @.@ 85 met[MASK]es ( 6 @.@ 1 ft ) wide by 1 @.@ 35 metres ( 4 @.@ 4 ft ) deep and weighs 18 tons .[MASK]San Lorenz[MASK] Colossal Head 7 was reworked from a monumental throne ; it was discovered by a joi[MASK]t [MASK]rcha[MASK]ological [MASK]roject by the Instit[MASK]to Nacional de [MASK]ntropologí[MASK] e Historia and Yale University , as a result of a magnetom[MASK]ter survey . It was buried at a depth of less than 1 metre ( 3 @.@ 3 ft ) and was lying facing upwards , leaning slightly nor[MASK]hw[MASK]rds on its right hand side . The head is poorly preserved and has suffered both fr[MASK]m erosion and deliberate damage . The headdress is decorated with a pair of human hands ; a feather[MASK]d ornament is carved at the back of the h[MASK]adband and two [MASK]iscs ador[MASK] the front . A short stra[MASK] descends from the headband and hangs in fron[MASK] of the right ear . The[MASK]head sports large earflares that c[MASK]mpletely cover the e[MASK]rlobes , although[MASK]severe erosion makes their exact form difficult to distinguish . The fac[MASK] has wrinkles between th[MASK] nose and cheeks , sagging cheeks and deep @-@ set eyes ; the lips are badly damaged and the mouth is open , displaying the teeth . In 1986 the head was transported to the Museo de Antropología de Xalapa . 
 San L[MASK]renzo Colossal Head 8 ( also known as San Lorenzo Monument 61 ) s[MASK]ands 2 @.@ 2 metres ( 7 @.@ 2 ft[MASK]) [MASK]igh ; it measures 1 @.@ 65 metres ( 5 @.@ 4 ft[MASK]) wide by 1 @.@ [MASK] metres ( 5 @.@ 2 ft ) deep and weighs 13 tons . It is one of the finest examples of an Olmec coloss[MASK]l head . It was found lying on i[MASK]s side to the south of a monumental throne . The monument was discovered at a depth of 5 metres ( 16 ft ) dur[MASK]ng[MASK]a magnetometer survey of the site in 1968 ; it has been dated to the Early[MASK]Preclassic . After discovery it was[MASK]initially reburied ; it wa[MASK] moved to the Museo de[MASK]Antropología de Xalapa in 1986 . The headdress is decorated with the talons or claws of either a jaguar or an eagle . [MASK]t has a headband and a cover that descends from under the h[MASK]address proper behind the ears . Two short stra[MASK]s descend in[MASK]front of the ears . The head sports large ear ornaments in the form of pegs . The face is[MASK]that of a mature male with sagging cheeks and wri[MASK]kles between these and the nose . The forehead i[MASK] gathered in a frown . The mouth is slightly parted to reveal the teeth . Most of the head is carved in a realistic manner , the exception being the ears . These are stylised and [MASK]epresented by one question mark shape contained within another . The head is very well preserved and displays a fine finish . 
 San Lorenzo Colossal Head 9 is als[MASK] known as San Loren[MASK]o Monument 66 . It measures 1 @.@ 65 metres ( 5 @.@ 4 ft ) high by 1 @.@ 36 metres ( 4 @.@[MASK]5[MASK]ft ) wide by 1 @.@ [MASK]7 metr[MASK]s ([MASK]3 @.@ 8 ft ) deep . The head was exposed in 1982 by erosion of the gullies at San Lorenzo ; it was found leaning slightly on its right hand side and f[MASK]cing upwards , half covered by the collapsed side of a gully and washed by a stream . Although it was documented by archaeologists , it remained for some[MASK]time i[MASK] [MASK]ts place of discovery before being moved to th[MASK] Museo [MASK]e Antropología de Xalapa . The headdress is of a s[MASK]ngle piece without a distinct headband . The sides dis[MASK]lay features that are possibly intended to represent long hair trailin[MASK] to the bottom of the monument . The earfla[MASK]es are rectan[MASK]ular plates with an additional trapezoid ele[MASK]ent at the front . The head is also[MASK]depicted wearing a nose @-@ ring . The face is smiling and has wrinkles u[MASK]der the eyes and at the edge of the mouth . It has sagging c[MASK]eeks and wide eyes . The mouth i[MASK] closed and the upper lip is badly damaged . The sculpture suffered some mutilation in antiquity , with nine pits hollowed into [MASK]he face and headdress . 
 San Lorenzo Colossal Head 10 ( also known as San Lorenzo Monument 89 ) has bee[MASK] moved to the Museo Comunitario de San[MASK]Lorenzo Tenoch[MASK]itlán near Texistepec . It stands 1 @.@ 8 metres ( 5 @.@ 9 ft ) tall and measu[MASK]es 1 @.@ 43 metres ( 4 @.@ 7 ft ) wide by 0 [MASK].@[MASK]92 metres ( 3 [MASK].@ 0 [MASK]t ) deep ; it weighs 8 to[MASK]s . The head was disco[MASK]e[MASK]ed by a magnetometer survey in 1994 ; it was found buried , lying face upwards in the bottom of a ravine and was exc[MASK]vated by Ann Cyphers . The headdress is formed of 92 circular beads that completely cover the upper part of the [MASK][MASK][MASK]d and[MASK]descend across the si[MASK]es and back . Above the forehead is a large element forming a three @-@ toed foot with long nails , possibly t[MASK][MASK] foot of a bird . The head wears large earspools that protrude beyond the beads of the headdress . The spools have [MASK]he form of a rounded square with a circular sunken central portion . The face is that of a mature man with the mouth close[MASK] , sagging cheeks and lines under the eyes . The mouth is sensitively carved and[MASK]the head possesses a pronounced chin .

 Three of the La Venta heads were found in a line running east @-@ west in the northern Complex I ; all three faced northwards , away from the city c[MASK]ntre .[MASK]The other head was found in Complex B to the south of the Great Pyramid , in a plaza that included a number of other sculptures . The latter , the first of the La Venta heads[MASK]to be discovered , was found during archaeological exploration of La Venta in 1925 ; the other three remained unknown [MASK]o archaeologists until a local boy guided Matthew Stirling[MASK]to them whil[MASK][MASK]he was excavating the first head in 1940 . They were locate[MASK] [MASK]pprox[MASK]mately 0[MASK]@.@ 9 kilometres ( 0 @.@ 56 mi ) to the north [MASK]f Monument 1 . 
 La Venta Monument 1 is speculated to have been the portrait of La Venta '[MASK] final ruler . Monument 1 measures 2 @.@ 41 metres ( 7 @.@ 9 ft ) high by 2 @.@ 08 metres ( 6 @.@ 8 ft ) wide by [MASK] @.@ 95 metres[MASK]( 6 @.@ 4 ft ) deep ; it weighs 24 tons .[MASK]The front of the h[MASK]address is decorated with t[MASK]ree motifs that apparently represe[MASK]t the claws[MASK]or fangs [MASK][MASK] an animal . Above thes[MASK] symbols is an angular U @-@ shaped decoration descending from the sc[MASK]lp . On each side of the monu[MASK]ent a strap descends fro[MASK] the headdress , passing in front of the[MASK]ear . Each ear has a prominent ear ornament that descends from the earlobe to the base of the monument . The features are those of a matur[MASK] man , with wrinkles around the mouth , eyes and nose . Monument 1 is the best preserved head at La Venta but has suffered from erosion , particularly at the back . The head was first describ[MASK]d by Franz Blom an[MASK] Oliver La Farge who [MASK]nvestigated the La Venta remains on behalf of Tulane University in 1925 . When discovered it was half [MASK]-@ buried ; its massive size meant that the discoverers were unable to excavate[MASK]it completely . Matthew Stirling fully excavated the monument in 1940 , after clearing the thick vege[MASK]ation that had covered it in the intervening years . Monument 1 has been moved to th[MASK] [MASK]arque @-@ Museo La Venta in Villahermosa . The head was f[MASK]und in its original context ; associated fin[MASK]s have been radiocarbon dated to between 1000 and 600 BC . 
 La Venta Mo[MASK]ument 2 measures 1 @.@ 63 m[MASK]tres ( 5 @.@ 3 ft ) high by 1 @[MASK]@ 35 metres ( 4 @.@ 4 ft ) wide by 0 @.@ 98 met[MASK]es [MASK] 3 @[MASK]@ 2 ft[MASK]) deep ; the head weighs 11 @.@ 8 tons . The face has a broadly smiling expression that reveals four of the upper teeth . The cheeks are given prominence by the action of smiling ; the brow that is normally visible in other he[MASK]ds is covered by t[MASK]e rim of the headdress . The face is badly eroded , distorting the features . In addition to the severe erosion damage ,[MASK]the upper [MASK]ip an[MASK] a part [MASK]f the nose have been deliberately mutilated . The head was found [MASK]n its original context a few metres north of the northwest corner of pyramid @-@ platform A @-@ 2 . Radiocarbon dating of the monume[MASK]t 's [MASK]ontext dates it to between 1000 and 600 BC . [MASK]onument 2 has suff[MASK]red erosion damage fro[MASK] its exposure to the elements prior to discovery . The head has a prominent headdress but this is badly eroded and any individual detail has been erased . A strap desc[MASK]nds in front of the ear on each side of the head , descending as far as the earlobe . The head is adorned with ear ornaments in the form of a disc that covers t[MASK]e earlo[MASK]e , with an associated clip or peg . The survivi[MASK]g details of the headdress and earflares are stylistically similar to those of T[MASK]es Zapotes Monument A. The hea[MASK] has be[MASK]n moved to the Museo del Est[MASK]do de Tabasco in Villahermosa[MASK]. 
 La Venta Monumen[MASK] 3 stands 1 @.@[MASK]98 metres ( 6[MASK]@.@ 5 ft ) high and measures 1 @.@ 6 [MASK]etre[MASK] ( 5 @.@ 2 ft ) wide by 1 metre ( 3 @.@ 3 ft ) deep[MASK]; it weighs 12 @.@ 8 tons . Monument 3 was located a few metres t[MASK] [MASK]he east of Monument 2 , but was moved to the Parque @-@ Museo La Vent[MASK] in Villahe[MASK]mosa . Like the other La Venta heads , its context has been radiocarbon dated to [MASK]etween 1000 and 600 BC . It appears unfinished and has suffer[MASK]d severe damage through [MASK]eathering , making analysis difficult . It had a large headdress t[MASK]at reaches to the eyebrows but any details have been lost through erosion . Straps descend in fr[MASK]nt [MASK]f each ear and continue to the base of the monument . The [MASK]ars are wearing large flattened rings that overlap th[MASK] straps ; they [MASK]robably represent jade ornaments of a type th[MASK]t have been recovered in the Olmec region . Althou[MASK]h most of the facial detail is lost , the crinkling of[MASK]the bridge of the nose is still evident , a feature tha[MASK] is common to the frownin[MASK] expressio[MASK]s of the other Olmec colossal heads . 
 La Venta Monument 4 measures 2 @.@ 26 metres ( 7 @.@ 4 ft[MASK]) high by 1 @.@ 98 metres ( 6 @.@ 5 ft ) wide and 1 @.@ 86 metres ( 6 @.@ 1 ft[MASK]) deep . I[MASK] weighs 19 @.@ 8 tons . I[MASK] was found[MASK]a few metres to the west of Monument 2 and has been moved [MASK]o the Parque @-@ Museo La Venta . As wi[MASK]h the other heads in the group , its arc[MASK]aeological context has been radioca[MASK]bon dated to between 1000 and 600 BC . The headdress is elaborate and , although [MASK]amaged , various detai[MASK]s are still discernible . The base of the h[MASK]address is formed by three horizontal strips running over the forehead . One side is decorated with[MASK]a double @-@ disc motif that may have been repeated on the other ; if so , damage to the right side has oblit[MASK]rated any trace of it . The top of the headdress is decorated wi[MASK]h the cla[MASK][MASK]d foot of a bird of prey . Either stra[MASK]s o[MASK] plaits of hair descend on either side of the face , from the h[MASK]address to the base of the monument . Only one e[MASK]rspool survives [MASK] it is fl[MASK]t , in the form of a roun[MASK]ed s[MASK]uare , and is decor[MASK]ted with[MASK]a cross motif[MASK]. The ears have been completely eroded awa[MASK] and the lips are damaged . The surviving features display a frown and creasing around the nose and cheeks . [MASK]he head displays prominent teeth . 
 
 = = = Tres Zapotes = = = 
 
 The two heads a[MASK] Tres Z[MASK]potes , with the [MASK]a Cobata head , are stylistically distinct from[MASK]the other k[MASK]own examples . Bea[MASK]r[MASK]z de la Fuente view[MASK] them as a late regional survival of an [MASK]lder tradition while other scholars argue that they are merely the kind of regional variant to be exp[MASK]cted in a frontier settlement . These heads are sculpted with relatively simple headdresses ; they have squat , wide proportions and d[MASK]stinctiv[MASK] fac[MASK]al features . The two Tres Zapotes heads are the earliest known stone monuments from the site . The discovery of one of the Tres Zapotes head[MASK] in the nineteenth c[MASK]ntury led to the first archaeolog[MASK]cal investigations of Olmec cultu[MASK]e , carried out by Matthew Stirling [MASK]n 1938 . 
 Tres[MASK]Zapot[MASK]s Monument A ( also known as Tres Zapotes Colossal Head 1 ) was the first colossal h[MASK]ad to be found , discovered b[MASK] accident in the middle of the nineteenth cent[MASK]ry [MASK] 1 kilometre ( 0 @.@ 62 mi )[MASK]to the north of the modern village of Tres Zapotes . After its discovery it remained half @-@ buried until it was excavated by Matthew Stirling in 19[MASK]9 . At so[MASK]e point it was moved to th[MASK] [MASK]laza of the modern village , probably in t[MASK]e[MASK]early 1960s . It has since been moved to the Museo Comunitario [MASK]e Tres Zapotes . Monumen[MASK] A stands 1 @.@ 47 metres ( 4 @.@ 8 ft ) tall ; it measures 1 @.@ 5 metres ( 4 @.@ [MASK] ft ) wide by 1 @.@ 45 metres ( 4 @.@ 8 ft ) deep , and is estimated to wei[MASK]h 7 @.@ 8 tons . T[MASK]e head is s[MASK]ulpted with a simple headdress with a wide ba[MASK]d that is otherwise unador[MASK]ed , and wears [MASK]ecta[MASK]gular ear ornaments that project forwards onto the cheeks . The face[MASK]is carved with deep creases b[MASK]tween the cheeks and the nose and [MASK]round the mouth ; t[MASK]e forehead is creased into a frown . The upper lip has suf[MASK]ered recent damage , with the left portion flaking away . 
 Tres Zapotes Monument Q ( also k[MASK]own as the Nestape Head and Tr[MASK]s Zapotes Colossal Head 2 ) measures 1 @.@ 45 metres ( 4 @.@ 8 ft ) high by 1 @.@ 34 metres ( 4 @.@ 4 ft ) wide by 1 @.@ 26 metres ( 4 @.@[MASK]1 ft ) deep and weighs 8 @.@ 5 tons . Its exact date of discovery is unknown but is [MASK]stimated to have been some time in the 1940s , when[MASK]it was struck by machinery [MASK]eing used to clear veget[MASK]tion from Nestape hill . Monume[MASK]t Q was the eleventh colossal[MASK]head to be discovered . I[MASK] w[MASK]s moved to the plaza of Sa[MASK]t[MASK]ago Tuxtla in 1951 and remains there to this da[MASK] [MASK] Monument Q was first described by Wil[MASK]iams and Heizer in an article published in 196[MASK] . The he[MASK]ddress is decorat[MASK]d with a[MASK]frontal tongue @-@ sha[MASK]ed ornament , and the back of the head is sculpted with seven plaits of hair bound with tassels . A strap descends from each side of the headdress , passing over the ears and to the base of the[MASK]monument . The face has pronounced creases around the nose , mouth and eyes . 
 
 = = = La Cobata = = = 
 
 The La Cobata region was the source of the basalt used for car[MASK]ing all of the colossal heads in the Olmec [MASK]eartland . The La Co[MASK]ata coloss[MASK]l head was discovered in 1970 and was the fifteenth to be recorded . It was discovered in a mountain pass in the Sierra de los Tux[MASK]las , on the north side of El Vigia vol[MASK]ano near to Santiago Tuxtla .[MASK]The head was largely buried when found ; excavat[MASK]ons uncovered a La[MASK]e Classic ( 600 – 900 AD ) offering associated with the head cons[MASK]sting of a ceramic vessel and a 12 @-@ centimetre ( 4 @.@ 7 in ) long obsidian knife placed pointing northwards towards the head . The offering is believed to have been deposited long after the head [MASK]as sculpted . The La Cobata head has been moved from its original locatio[MASK] to the main plaza at Santiago . 
 The La Cobata head is more or less rounded and measures 3 by 3 metres ( 9 @.@ 8 by 9 @.@ 8 ft ) by 3 @.@ 4 metres ( 11 ft ) high , making it the largest known head . This massive sculpture is estimated to[MASK]weigh 40 tons . It is [MASK]tylistically distinct[MASK]from the other examples , and Beatriz de la Fuente placed it late in the Olmec time frame . The characteristics of the sculpture have led to some investigators suggesting that it rep[MASK]esents a deceased person . Norman Hammond argue[MASK] that the apparent stylistic differences of the monume[MASK]t stem from its unfinished[MASK]state rather than its late production . The eyes of the monument are closed , the nose is flattened and lacks nostrils and the mouth was not sculpted in a realistic manner . The headdress[MASK]is in th[MASK] form of a plain[MASK]horizontal band . 
 The original location[MASK]of the La Cobata head was not a major archaeological site and it is likely that the head wa[MASK] either abandoned at [MASK]ts source or during transport to its in[MASK]ended destination . Various features of the head suggest that it w[MASK]s unfinished , such as a lack of [MASK]ymmetry below the mouth and an area of [MASK]ough stone above the base . Rock was n[MASK]t removed from around the earspools as on other heads , and does not narro[MASK] toward[MASK] the base . Large parts of the monument seem to be roughed out without finished detail . The right hand earspool also appears incomplete ; the fo[MASK]ward portion is marked with a sculpted line while the rear portion has been sculpted in relief , probably indicating that the right cheek and eye area were also unfinished . The La Cobata head was almost cert[MASK][MASK]n[MASK]y carved[MASK]from a raw bould[MASK]r rather than being s[MASK]ulpted from a throne .

 Takalik Abaj Monument 23 dates to the Middle Preclassic period , and is found in Takalik Abaj , an im[MASK]ortant city in the foothil[MASK]s of the Guatemalan Pacific coast , in the modern department [MASK]f Retalhuleu . It appears to be an Olmec @-@ style [MASK]olossal head re @-@ carved into a niche figure sculpture . If or[MASK]ginally a colossal[MASK]head then it would be the only[MASK]known example from outside the Olme[MASK] he[MASK]rtland . 
 Monument 23 is sculpted from andesite and falls in the midd[MASK]e of the size range [MASK]or confirmed colossal heads . It stands 1 @.@ 84 metre[MASK] ( 6 @.@ 0 ft ) high and measures 1 @.@ 2 metres[MASK]( 3 @.[MASK] 9 ft ) wide by 1 @.@ 56 metres ( 5 @.@ 1 ft ) deep . Like t[MASK]e examples from the Olmec heartland , the monument features a flat bac[MASK] . Lee Parsons c[MASK]ntests John Graham 's i[MASK]entification of Monument 23 as a re @-@ carved colossal head ; he views the side ornaments , identi[MASK]ied by Graham as ears , as rather the scrolled eyes of an open @-@ jawed monster gazing upwards . C[MASK]unteri[MASK]g[MASK]this , James Porter has claimed that the re @-@ carving of the face of a colossal head into a niche figure is clearly evident . 
 Monument 23 was damaged in the mid @-@ twentieth century by a loca[MASK] mason who attempted to break its expo[MASK]ed upper portion using a[MASK]steel chisel . As a result , the top is fragmented , although the broken pieces were[MASK]recovered by archaeologists and have been put back into place .

 = = Early life = = 
 
 [MASK]radley[MASK]Kent Stevens grew up in Zionsville , Indiana , where he developed his love for basketball . Starting at age five , Stevens would [MASK]atch tap[MASK]d basketball games " before he went[MASK]to afternoon kindergarten " . His father would often drive hi[MASK] to Blooming[MASK]on , to watch Indiana Hoosiers games . " It 's hard not to[MASK]be [[MASK]in love with basketball ] when yo[MASK] 're a kid growing up in Indiana " , S[MASK]evens later said . 
 For his eighth birt[MASK]da[MASK] , Stevens received a new basketball hoop . " It ’ s [MASK]o much fun to dream in your driveway , " he later remarked . " That ’ s where my friends and I hung out . It was a[MASK]lot of fun to grow up in that era . " When a friend , Brandon Monk , had a basketball[MASK]court installed in his back yard , [MASK]tevens " app[MASK]ared instantaneously . " He was so dedicat[MASK]d to the game that he would bring the unprepared ingredients for grilled cheese sandwiches ov[MASK]r to [MASK]onk 's house , s[MASK] that he would not waste time waiting for the sandwi[MASK]hes to cook . 
 Monk 's court soon became a g[MASK]thering place , where Zionsville kids and kids from the surrounding areas would hold pickup games . These games helped develop Stevens ' competitive streak . B[MASK]sides playi[MASK]g basketball , the young[MASK]Stevens also enjoye[MASK] solving puzzles , a sk[MASK]ll he later applied to analyzing opposing teams to find their weaknesses . 
 Stevens attended Zionsville Community High School , where he became [MASK] star basketball pl[MASK]yer . He [MASK]ore No. 31 in high sch[MASK]ol in honor of Indiana Pacers [MASK]uard[MASK]Reggie Miller . During his freshman year , he wo[MASK]ld get up early to practice shooting at a local gym before school . Th[MASK] hard work paid off a[MASK] Stevens made the varsity team that same year . By[MASK]the time his high school career was complete , Stevens had [MASK]et school records for career scoring , assists , steals , and thr[MASK]e @-@ point field go[MASK]ls . A[MASK] of 2010 , he stil[MASK] holds the reco[MASK]ds for points ( 1508 ) , assists ( 444 ) , and steals ( 156 ) , as well as the single @-@ season points record ( 64[MASK] in 1995 ) . Stevens was named to the all @-@ conference team three times . In 1995 , he was [MASK]amed the sec[MASK]iona[MASK] MVP and was the leading[MASK]scorer in state [MASK]ectional play ( 32 @.@ 3 ppg ) . 
 Stevens made the academi[MASK] all @-@ state f[MASK]rst team and r[MASK]ceived the Straight A Gold Medal Award all four year[MASK] . He was a member of the N[MASK]tional Honor Society , gra[MASK]uati[MASK]g seventh in[MASK]his class of 1[MASK]5 . He [MASK]arned three letters in basketba[MASK]l , thre[MASK] in track , and one in baseball during his days a[MASK] Zionsville . During summers , he traveled the co[MASK]ntry playing AAU basketball . 
 Although Ste[MASK]ens had a strong passion for the game , he realized that his basketball skil[MASK]s were modest and not likely to get him very far . As such , h[MASK] chose to attend academically oriented DePauw University for college .[MASK]During his stay , he played in all 101 DePauw games , earning four varsity letters . He earned multiple all @-@ conference and academic all [MASK]-@ conference awards , and was a three @-@ time [MASK]cademic All @-@ America nominee[MASK]. He was a team captain his senior year , and averaged more than 8 poi[MASK]ts per game three of his four years . His career highs were 24 points and 8 rebounds in a game . After his senior year , Stevens received the Coaches ’ Award . Coach Bill Fenlon later described Stevens as " one of the most selfless , team @-@ oriented person [ s[MASK]c ] I 've ever been around . " 
 While at DePauw , Stevens was a member of the Management Fellows Honors P[MASK]ogram and[MASK]the DePauw Community Service[MASK] ’ Sports Night execut[MASK]ve board . He was also a b[MASK]other of the Alpha Tau Omega fraternity . [MASK]uring summer vacations , Stevens[MASK]spent time teachin[MASK] at Butler basketball camps . He was named to the Dean [MASK]s list and graduated in 1999 with a degree in economics .

 In the summer[MASK]of 2000 , Stevens was offered the opportu[MASK]ity to volunteer in the Butler basketball office . He ran t[MASK]e idea of quitting his job at Eli Lilly by then @-@ longtime girlfriend Tracy Wilhelmy . She thought about it for two hours before telling him t[MASK] go for it . " Now , it looks like a great idea , " Steve[MASK]s later remarked . "[MASK]At the time , I thought it was somethin[MASK] I really wanted [MASK]o try . " Tracy went back to school to get a law degree that[MASK]could[MASK]support the couple if things did not wor[MASK] out for Brad . " We were 23 and realized this was our chance , " Tracy later said . " Five[MASK]years down the road , we were probably[MASK]not going to be in a position to do that . The more success[MASK]you had at Lilly , the harder it would be to leave . " 
 Stevens planned to live[MASK]in a friend 's basement and took a job at Applebee ’ s to pay the bills . Before he started t[MASK]aining at Applebee 's , he was offered a low @-@ paying administrative position as coordinator of basketball operations under then @-@ coach Tha[MASK] Matta [MASK] The position had opened up wh[MASK]n ass[MASK]stant coach Jamal Meeks resigned after being arrested on sol[MASK]citation and drug charges , of which he was [MASK]a[MASK]er ac[MASK]uitted . Years later , Matta recalled , " [ Stevens ] was just a hungry young [MASK]id that was desperate to get into coaching . He had a great passion and was willing to take a risk to get into the coaching profession . " 
 After Matta left the school followin[MASK] the 2000 – 01 seas[MASK]n , new head coach Todd Lickliter promoted Stevens to [MASK] full @-@ time assistant coach . Under Lickliter , St[MASK]vens was active in every aspect of the game : skills instruction , game preparation , in @-@ game coaching , and recruiting .

The Butler players had a meeting [MASK]ith athletic director Barry Collier , urging him to promote from within . Collier , having spent the entire season observing the assistant coaches ' interaction with the [MASK]eam , agreed . T[MASK]e day after Lickl[MASK]ter resigned Stevens and Butler 's two other assista[MASK]t coaches interviewed for the job . Within 24 hours of[MASK]the interviews Stevens was named Butler 's new head coach . According to Collier , Stevens had something older , outside candidates could never [MASK]atch : [MASK]ix years of experience learning the Butler system , du[MASK]bed " The But[MASK]er Way " by Collier [MASK] " Age wasn 't a factor because I 'd seen his ability shine through during the course of the season ,[MASK]" Collier said .

 At the start of the 2007 – 08 season , Stevens was the second younges[MASK] coach in Division I basketball . He got off to a fast start , winning his first eight games before falli[MASK]g to Wright State[MASK]4[MASK] – 42 . Legendary coach Bob Knight , whos[MASK] Texas Tech team[MASK]was an early victim ,[MASK]said " I wish we played as smart as they do . " Virgi[MASK]ia [MASK]ech coach Seth Greenberg added " t[MASK]ey 've got toug[MASK]ness about them and they expect to win . " 
 Midway through Stevens ' f[MASK]rst season , with the Bulldog[MASK] at 12 – 1 , The New York Times wrote[MASK]" so far , Steven[MASK] has made the transition [ to head coach ] [MASK]ook easy . " The Times went on to state that Stevens had the calm and composure of a seasoned veteran . " You ’ ve got a [MASK]ot of people always looking for the next step . [MASK]n[MASK] that ’ s not what I was doing . I was just trying to figure out a way to win the next game and think like a he[MASK]d coach . " Stevens said . 
 Butler ended the regular season with a 27 – 3 record , taking first place in the Horizon League with a 16 – 2 in[MASK]conference mark . The team[MASK]beat Illinois @-@ Chicago 66 – 50 and Cleveland State 7[MASK] – 55 to claim the leagu[MASK] 's tournament title and an automatic bid to[MASK]the 2008 NCAA tournament . Butler was awarded the seven seed in the East Regional . They beat tenth @-@ seeded South Alabama 81 [MASK] 61 in the first round , before falling to second @-@ seeded T[MASK]nness[MASK]e 76 – 71 in overtime . 
 Stevens [MASK]nded up with a scho[MASK]l and Horizon league record 30 wins , beating several big name schools – Michigan , Texas Tech , Florida State ,[MASK]Ohio State – along the way . In so doing , he became the third @-@ youngest[MASK]head coach in NCAA Division I history to lead a team to 30 wins in a season , and became t[MASK]e fourth @-@ winningest first @-@ year coach . Butler was n[MASK]tionally ranked for a school and league rec[MASK]rd 19 consecutive weeks . Butler 's 30 – 4 record was the best among t[MASK]ams that did not reach the Final Four .

 Fueled in large part by Gordon Hayward 's and Shelvin Mack 's ro[MASK]es in leading Team US[MASK] to the gold medal in the FI[MASK]A Under @-@ 19 World Championship during the off @-@ season , Butler began the season [MASK]anked 10th in the Coaches ' Pol[MASK] and 11th in the AP Poll . A few commentators picked the Bulldogs as a possible " sleeper team " to make the Final Four . Stevens was not so sure , privately telling his father , " We have a really good team , and I ’ m not sure how far we can go this year , b[MASK]t next year , we ought to go really far [MASK] " 
 Butler got off to a mediocre star[MASK] , losing twice in the 7[MASK] Classic 82 – 73 to 22n[MASK] @-@ ranked Minn[MASK]sota and to 19th @-@ ranked[MASK]Clemson 70 – 69 .

 For their season , the Bulldogs were[MASK]ranked 8th in the final pre @-@ NCAA tournament Coaches ' Poll and 11th in the corresponding AP Poll .[MASK]On Selection Sunday , the Bulldogs w[MASK]re seeded fifth in the West region[MASK]l of the NCAA tournament and give[MASK] a f[MASK]rst @-@ round ma[MASK]ch[MASK]up with twelfth seeded UTEP on March 18 . 
 Many basketball commentat[MASK]rs picked UTEP[MASK]t[MASK] pull the upset , and at halftime it looked like they might be right , as UTEP l[MASK]d 33 – 27 . [MASK]tevens made a number of halftime adjustm[MASK][MASK]ts , and the Bulldogs came out firing on all cy[MASK]inders in the second half [MASK] The team[MASK]dominated the second half and won the game [MASK]7 – 59 . Butler next faced off with [MASK]hirteenth seeded Murray State . The g[MASK]me was close thr[MASK]ugh[MASK]ut , but Butler emerged victorious 54 – 52 when Hayward deflected a Murray State pass into the back court with less than five seconds on the [MASK]lock . The win[MASK]gave Stevens the first [MASK]weet Sixteen appearance of his c[MASK]reer . 
 On March 25 , 2010 , Butler faced top @-@ seeded Syracuse . The Bulldogs got off to a good s[MASK]art , jumping out [MASK]o a 12 – 1 lead and a[MASK]35 – 25 halftime[MASK]advantage . Syracuse rallied in the second half , taking its first lead of the game , 40 – 39 , off a Wes Johnson thr[MASK]e @-@ pointer . Stevens called timeout and Butler rega[MASK]ned the lead on its next possession , stopping the run . At t[MASK]e 5 : 32 mark , Syracuse got a rare fast break opportunity that e[MASK]ded with a dunk[MASK]and 54 – 50 l[MASK]ad . Stevens again called time out and re @-@ focused the team . Butler responded by holding Syracuse scoreless for the next 5 min[MASK]tes , taking a 60 – 54 lead with 0 : 59 to go . Butler held on to win 63 – 59 , advancing to the Elite Eight [MASK]or the first time i[MASK] school history . 
 [MASK]wo da[MASK]s later , Stevens ' Bulldogs met second @-@ seeded Kansas State in the regional fin[MASK]ls . Perhap[MASK] feeling the effects of their double overtime 101 – 96 win [MASK]wo d[MASK]ys prior , Kansas State got off to[MASK][MASK] slow start , scoring just 20 points in the fi[MASK]st half to trail 27 –[MASK]20 . But[MASK]er kept the lead in the upper single digits for most of the second h[MASK]lf , before Kansas State went on a 13 – 2 run and [MASK]ook a 5[MASK] – 51 lead . Stevens immedia[MASK]ely called[MASK]time out and re @-@ focused the team . " Play your game . Just play [MASK]our game[MASK], " he told the[MASK] . On the ensuing possessio[MASK] , Butler regained the le[MASK]d for good . They outscored Kansas State 12 – 4 the rest of the way an[MASK] won the game 63 – 56 . In the post game celebration , Stevens and walk @-@ [MASK]n forward Emerson Kampen connected on a [MASK]lying back @-@ bump that b[MASK]came one of the iconic images of the[MASK]tournament . 
 The[MASK]win ear[MASK]ed[MASK]the Bulldogs a trip back to Indianapolis for the first Final Four appearance in school and Horizon League history . The win made Stevens , at age 33 , the youngest coach to lead a team to the Final Four since Bob Knight made his first Final Four appear[MASK]nce at age 32 in 1973 . Butler became[MASK]the small[MASK]st school ( enrollment 4 @,@ 200 ) to make the Final Four since seeding began in 1979 .

 On April 3 , Bra[MASK] Stevens and the Butler Bulldogs faced off with Michigan St[MASK]te in the national semi @-@ finals . Michigan State took an early 14 – 7 lead ,[MASK]and Matt How[MASK]rd got in early foul trouble , si[MASK]ting most the first h[MASK]lf . Stevens kept the team focused with a " next man up " attitude and the game was tied at 28 at halftime . The second half was dominated[MASK]by tight defense[MASK]for both sides . With 2 : 45 to go in the game , the score[MASK]was 47 – 44 Butler[MASK].[MASK]Michigan State called a time out [MASK]o set up a play . Stevens correctly anticipated the play call and had Ronald Nored , the team 's best defender , switch onto Korie Lucious off a screen . Nored stole the ball and Shawn Vanzant got fouled on the re[MASK]ulting run out , hitting 1 of 2 . Trailing 50 – 49 with under 30 seco[MASK]ds remaining , Michigan State cam[MASK] up empty and was [MASK]o[MASK]ced to foul[MASK]. Nore[MASK] hit both foul shots , giving Butl[MASK]r a 52 – [MASK]9 lead . After a Michigan [MASK]tate time out , Stevens had his team foul Luci[MASK]us with 2 seconds remaining to pre[MASK]ent a p[MASK]tentially game tying[MASK]3 @-@ pointer . After m[MASK]king the first , Lucious intentionally [MASK]issed the second free throw . Hayward came[MASK]down with the rebound to seal the victory . Butler became the first team since the shot clock was ad[MASK]pted for the 1985 – 86 season to hold [MASK]ive st[MASK]aig[MASK]t to[MASK]rnament opponents under [MASK]0 point[MASK] . 
 On April 5 ,[MASK]2010 , But[MASK]er and Duke faced off i[MASK] what The New York Times called " the most eagerly awaited championship game in years " [MASK] Late in the first half , Duke went on an[MASK]8 – 0 run to take a 26 – 20 lead . Stevens called a timeout . With starters Matt Howard and Ronald Nored on the bench i[MASK] foul tr[MASK]uble , Stevens was forc[MASK]d to call on backup center Avery Jukes who came up big for Butler . Jukes scored 10 first half points , tying his se[MASK]son[MASK]high . At half time , Duke [MASK]s lead stood at 33 – 32 . [MASK] The second half was played very closely , with neither team taking a [MASK]ubstantia[MASK] lead . W[MASK]th 3 : 16 to play , Duke took a 60 – 55 lead on two made free throws by Nola[MASK] Smith . Butler cut the l[MASK]ad to one point in[MASK]the[MASK]final minute and , after a mi[MASK]sed Kyle Singler jump shot with 36 seconds remaining , got a chance to retake the lead . Butler was unable to initiate their offe[MASK]se and Stevens called a [MASK]imeout t[MASK] set up a play . A failed inbounds attempt and a timeout later[MASK], Hayward mi[MASK]sed[MASK]a baseline fade @-@[MASK]away jumper and Brian Zoubek [MASK]ame down with the [MASK]ebound for Duke . He was quickly fouled with less than 4 seconds remaining . Hayward narrowly[MASK]missed a desperation half @-@ court shot court as time expired ,[MASK]making the final margin 61 – 59 . 
 The loss snapped Butler 's 25 @-@[MASK]game[MASK]winning streak , the longest in s[MASK]hool history . Butler beca[MASK]e the smallest school to play for a National Championship since Jacksonville i[MASK] 1970 . Stevens became the second @-@ youngest head coach to coach i[MASK] the NCAA National Champio[MASK]ship Game , behind Branch McCracken who led the Indiana Hoosiers to the 1940 National Champ[MASK]onship at age 31 . Stevens was named as both a Hugh Durham and Jim Phelan Award finalist fo[MASK] the third consecutive y[MASK]ar , losing to Mike Young and Jamie Dixon respectively .

 After the end of the 2009 – 10 season , Brad Stevens and Butler continued to attract considerable attention . Presi[MASK]ent Ba[MASK]ack Obama personally called Stevens to con[MASK]ratulate him on Butler 's season . David Letterman had St[MASK]vens on his show for a [MASK]uest appearance . Butler admissions inquiries shot up 67 % . Stevens received fan letters from [MASK]round the world , and his phone rang off the hook . He was [MASK]nvited to throw the ceremonial first[MASK]pitch before the Chicago Cubs vs. Florida Marlins game in Chicago on May 10 . " It 's all been very surreal , " Stevens said .[MASK]" If you are the runner @-@ [MASK]p ,[MASK]you don 't expect to talk to the president . " " It 's been a little overwhelming , because I 'm a pretty simple guy , [MASK] he added . 
 The 2009 – 10 season also h[MASK]lped increase Bu[MASK]ler 's recruiting pro[MASK]ile . Asked [MASK]f the increased fame would chang[MASK] things , Stevens said it bette[MASK] not spo[MASK]l him or the[MASK][MASK]niversity .

Duke coach Mike Krzyz[MASK]wski a[MASK]reed , saying Butler would be " right up [MASK]here , No. 1 or No. 2 ... They 'll be a favorite next year . " However , Hayward chose to leave early for the NBA[MASK]Draf[MASK] and Butler went through a rough patch early in the season , [MASK][MASK] one point losing three straight games and having a 6 – 5 conferenc[MASK] reco[MASK]d . Bolstered by the emergence of Andrew Smith at center and Matt Howard 's success as a perimeter forward , Butler ended up winning a share of the conference title at 13 – 5 . The Bulldogs[MASK]then won the Horizon League Tournament to secure an automatic NCA[MASK] t[MASK]urnament bid , and received an 8 see[MASK] . 
 Picked by many to lose a first @[MASK]@ [MASK]ound [MASK]atch @-@ up a[MASK]ainst Old Dominion , Butler advanced on a last @-@ s[MASK]cond tip @-@ in by Howard .

 On April 8 , 2010 , Stevens signed a long @[MASK]@ term deal with Butler[MASK], extending his co[MASK]tract through the 2021 – 22 season . Financial terms[MASK]of the contract were [MASK]ot disclosed ; however ,[MASK]Butler president Bobby Fong ha[MASK] publicl[MASK] stated that the university could afford to increase Stevens[MASK]' base salary to approximately US $ 1 @,@ 000 @,@[MASK]000 a few days prior . Stevens had previously m[MASK]de US $ 395 @,@ 000 plus bene[MASK]its in base salary , a relatively low fi[MASK]ure for a successful [MASK]ivision I head basketball coach . His total compensation for 200[MASK] – 10 was estimated a[MASK] US $ 750 @,@ 000 . Stevens had received a raise after each of his three seasons at Butler and [MASK]is contract contains [MASK] buyout clause estimated in the high six or low seven fig[MASK]res . 
 By re @-@ signing with Butler , Stevens temporarily ended speculation t[MASK]at he would leave the u[MASK]iversity for a higher paying job . Oregon , Clemson , and Wake Forest were all[MASK]said to be interested in offerin[MASK] Ste[MASK]ens multi @-@ million dollar contracts to leave Butler . " First and foremost , I ’ m loyal to Butler , " Stevens said[MASK]. When asked if he would ever leav[MASK] Butler , Stevens [MASK]epl[MASK]ed " I guess if they kick[MASK]d me out [MASK] " 
 After the 2011 – 12 season , Stevens was pursued vigorously by Illinois to fill their coac[MASK]ing vacancy before h[MASK] declined their offer . 
 In March 2013 , UCLA reportedly offered Stevens between $ 2 @.@ 5 a[MASK]d $ 3 million a year to leave Butler . Rumors circulated that Stevens was in contract negotiations with UCLA , but ultimately th[MASK] rumors proved false and Stevens stayed at Butler . Commenting on the situation , a source[MASK]close to Stevens said " Brad doesn 't understand why people would assume he 's leaving . " A few days later , Stevens reiterated that he was v[MASK]ry happy at Butler and had no intentions [MASK]o leave as long as he had the support of the university to [MASK]ontinue running [MASK]he program the " ri[MASK]ht way " .

 On July 3 , 2013 , Stevens was signed as the head coach by the Boston[MASK]Celtics . Reports state that his new[MASK]contract is a six @-@ year , $ 22 m[MASK]llion deal . In April 2015 , Stevens led the Celtics to the NBA Pla[MASK]offs as the 7th seed [MASK]n the Eastern Conference with a 40 – 42 record .

 = = Coaching style = = 
[MASK]
 Accordi[MASK]g to Stevens , in one of his first games as hea[MASK] coach [MASK] he was nervous and " felt like our team played on edge " because of it . He decided that a team 's play will reflect the mood of its coach ; a calm coach means a team that will remain poised in difficult game situations , while a nerv[MASK]us coach means a team that plays on edge . "[MASK]I don ’ t want to lose a game because of my [MASK]pproach , " he tol[MASK] [MASK]imself . Accord[MASK]ngly , he developed a strategy of always remaining calm and focused during games . He rarely raise[MASK] his voice or gets emotional[MASK], inste[MASK]d quietly[MASK]observing[MASK]on[MASK]the sideline with folded arms . He does not get upset ab[MASK]ut bad calls by referees or player mistakes , preferring to focus on " the next play " rather than what just happened . Butler player Willie Veasley explained Butler 's 2010 Final Four run by saying [MASK] " When those big runs [ by Syracuse and Kansas State ] came , Coach called a timeout and said a few calm words . Then he said[MASK]he believes in us , he loves us and we 're going to win the game . " On the [MASK]are occasion Stevens feels the need to correct a player , he does it with " positive reinforcement , [MASK]ust at a little louder decibel " , according to forme[MASK] assistant coach Matthew Graves . Above all , Stevens wants his players to be confident , not living in fear of b[MASK]ing yanked for making a bad play . 
 Externally , Stevens is always calm , but internally he is far f[MASK]om it . " I 'm not as calm as everybody thinks , " Stevens says . His wife Tracy adds , " He ’ s calm and collected , but he ’ s fiercely competitive . He ’ s always thinking about how he can beat you .[MASK]" Former player Joel Cornette says " E[MASK]eryone sees Brad as a level @[MASK]@ headed , c[MASK]lm and cool coach , but he ’ s about as competitive of a guy as I know . We wou[MASK]d get into it constantly , whether playing two @-@ on @-@ two or argui[MASK]g about [MASK]layers ’ having better college careers . " 
 Stevens s[MASK]ends a lot of time preparing for each game , and always tr[MASK]es to add a few new wrinkles specific to that game 's opponent . Sports Illustrated calls Stevens an expert " on breaking down tape and looking [MASK]t statistical trends to find opponents ' weaknesses . " Former player Ronald Nored agrees : " We know everything we need to about our opponents , all their tendencies are broken down " ahead of time . 
 Stevens is a proponent of using statistical analysis to enhance his coac[MASK]ing decisions , spend[MASK]ng almost as much t[MASK]me looking at statistics a[MASK] watching game film . " I think it 's a unique way of looking at the game that may be able to help best communicate to you[MASK] players " [MASK] he explains . For [MASK]xample , when Butler was slumping in late 2010 , Ste[MASK]ens challenged his team : " this [ 46 % defensive field goal percentage ] is where we are . This isn 't acceptable to get to wher[MASK] we want to go [MASK] But what does that really mean[MASK]? It 's not [MASK]ust get bett[MASK]r defensively , it is , if we give up 3 less ba[MASK]kets a game , then we will be at 40 percent field goal percentage defense which will be to[MASK] 20 in the country " . The team got the m[MASK]ssage , improved throughout the[MASK][MASK]eason , and ultimately went on a March run fueled by defense . In 2012 , S[MASK]evens became the first college coach to hire someone solely for statistical research when he added Drew Cannon to the staff . If he had the resources , Stevens says he would hire a team of statisticians to analyze the teams play . [MASK] Stevens ' teams are built around solid basketball fundamentals and good team work , rather than individual baske[MASK]ball skill . His teams [MASK]re known for their defense , forcing opponents into u[MASK]characteristic mistakes . The secret to basketball – and life – is " just to do the job to the best of your a[MASK]ility and don 't w[MASK]rry about anything else , " Stevens says . " Win the next game . Win[MASK]the next possession . That 's our focus . It 's bori[MASK]g . It 's also the way championships are won " , he says . In short , Stevens [MASK]s a st[MASK]ong believer in " The Butler Way " – doing all the little things that transform a group of good basketball [MASK]layers int[MASK] a great basketball team . "[MASK]I tell the players ' [MASK]he Butler Way ' isn 't easy [MASK]o define , " Stevens says , " but you can see it on the floor when we share the basketball , play with great energy and defend . " 
 Stevens prefers to recruit strong team play[MASK]rs in[MASK]tead of goi[MASK]g after " top recruits . " " The gu[MASK]s we [ have ] recruited , most of them weren 't very hig[MASK]ly[MASK]ranked , " Stevens says . " They had very go[MASK]d high school careers or careers at other places ( transfers ) , but for one reason or the other they weren 't seen as great pla[MASK]ers . But they all had[MASK]intangibles . " Stevens puts a strong emphasis on education and has said he would only recruit a " one and done " player if he was committed to getting his degree while playing professional[MASK]y . 
 Stevens has often b[MASK]en referred [MASK]o as a coaching prodigy , but is not interested in self @-@ promotion . He instead prefers to deflect the praise he receives to the players , athletic depar[MASK]ment , and his mentors . He has not been known to posture for more money , or to leak his name for open coaching positions . He has been described as humble , modest , and not " about the money " . 
 The New York Times , USA Tod[MASK]y , ESPN , and [MASK]the[MASK] comment[MASK]tors have attributed Butler 's success against teams with superior athletes to Stevens ' coaching style . The Times remarks , " the Bu[MASK]ldogs are very well prepared for their opponents , and they do not rattl[MASK] easily " , and says [MASK]hat the resulting confidence has led to the team 's success . " He coaches to his personality and to his strengths , " Collier says . " Obviously , he has g[MASK]eat rapport and communication ability with his team . " Yahoo ! Sports compared St[MASK][MASK]ens t[MASK] l[MASK]gendary coach John Wooden writing " Brad Steven[MASK] is wi[MASK]ning at Butler the Wooden way – calm and composed on the sideline . " Wooden agreed , saying , " I enjoy watching [ Stevens ] and very much en[MASK]oy [ Butler 's ] style of play . "

 Brad Stevens[MASK]is known for his youthful looks , often being described as " baby @-@ faced " . One commentator remar[MASK]ed , " Stevens looks like he checks the mirror every morning to see if it 's time to start shav[MASK]ng . " On occasion , he has been mistaken for a p[MASK]ayer . He is also known for projecting a professional , [MASK] corporate " look from the sidelines . Asked what his life would be like if he had never taken u[MASK] coaching[MASK], he replies " If everything else remain[MASK]d the same , I wou[MASK]d have been as happy[MASK]as heck ... Friends and family and[MASK]faith , t[MASK][MASK]y 're going to take th[MASK] cake over all thi[MASK] stu[MASK]f . " Stevens met his wife , Tracy ( née Wilhelmy ) , while attending DePauw U[MASK]iversity . Tracy , who played soccer for DePauw , quickly learned of Brad 's love for basketball ; on th[MASK]ir third date he drove her an hour and a half to attend a high [MASK]chool basketball game . Tracy graduated from Rocky River High School in 1995 , and from DePauw in 1999 . She returned to school in 2000 , driving five hours from Case Western 's law sch[MASK]ol to Indianapolis on weekends to see Brad . She finished her final ye[MASK]r of law school in Indianapolis , and the couple married in August 2003 . Tracy works as a labor and employment lawyer . Tracy also serves as Brad 's agent . 
 Brad and Tracy Stevens are involved with the American Cancer Society 's Coaches Vs . Cancer . Brad says that the cause really hit home for them after Tracy 's mot[MASK]er died of the disease in June 2004 . T[MASK]e day[MASK]before Butler 's 2010 Final Four appearance , they hosted a fu[MASK]draise[MASK] for the organization . Brad Steve[MASK]s has also volunteered his time to the Jukes Foundation for Kids , a charity benefiting Ugandan children run by former Butler player Avery Jukes .[MASK]Stevens r[MASK]mains in close touch with the Butler basketball family ; [MASK]e notably took a one @-@ game leave f[MASK]om the Celtics in January 2016 to visit with Andrew Smith , a player on both of Butler 's [MASK]inal Four teams who was dying of cancer ; Smith [MASK][MASK]ed less than a week later . At the request of Andrew 's w[MASK]dow , Sam ,[MASK]Brad delivered the eulogy at the memorial service on January 17 , 2016 . 
 Stevens ' [MASK]ather ,[MASK]Mark , is an orthop[MASK]dic surgeon in Indianapolis and former Indiana Hoosiers football player . His mother , Jan , is a university professor . She has previously taught at Butler .

 = Shackleton ( crater ) = 
 
 Shackleton is an im[MASK]act crater that lies at the south pole of the Moon . The peaks along the crater 's rim are [MASK]xposed to almost continual sunlight , while the interior is perpetually in shadow ( a Crater of eter[MASK]al darkness ) . The low @-@ temperature interior of this crater functions as a cold trap that may capture and freeze vol[MASK][MASK]iles shed during comet impacts on the Moon . Measurements by the Lunar Prospec[MASK]or spacecraft showed higher than normal amounts of hydr[MASK]gen within the crater , wh[MASK]ch may indicate the presence of water ice . The crater is named after Antarctic explorer Ernest [MASK]hackleton . 
 
 = = Description = = 
 
 The rotational axis of the [MASK]oon lies within Shackleton , only a few kilometers from its center . The crater is 21 km in diameter and 4 @.@ 2 km deep . From the Earth , it is viewed edge @-@ on in a region of rough , cratered terrain . It is located[MASK]within the South Pole @-@ Aitken basin on a massif . The rim is slightly rais[MASK]d abo[MASK]t the surrounding surface and it has an outer rampart that has been only lightly impacted . No significant craters intersect the rim , and it is [MASK]loped about 1 @.@ 5 ° toward the direction 50 – 90 ° from the Earth . The age o[MASK] the crater is about 3 @.@ 6 billion years and i[MASK] has been in the prox[MASK]mity of the sout[MASK] lunar pole for at least the last two billion[MASK][MASK]ears .[MASK]
 Because the orbit of the Moon is tilted only 5 ° f[MASK]om [MASK]he eclipt[MASK]c , the interior of this crater lies in perpetual [MASK]arkness . Estimates of the area in permanent sha[MASK]ow [MASK]ere obtained from Earth @-@ based radar studies . Peaks along the rim of the crater are al[MASK]ost continually illuminated by sunlight , spending abou[MASK] 80 – 90 % of each lunar orbit exposed to the Sun . [MASK]ontinuously illuminated mountains have been termed peaks of eternal light and hav[MASK] been predicted to exist since the 1900s . 
 The shadowed portion of the crater was imaged with the Terrain Camera of the Japanese SELENE spacecraft using the illumination of sunlight reflected o[MASK]f the rim . The interior of the crater consists of a symmetrical 30 ° slope that leads down to a 6 @.@ 6 km diameter floor . The handful of craters a[MASK]ong th[MASK] interior span no mor[MASK] than a few hundred meters . The bottom is [MASK]overed by an uneven [MASK]ound[MASK]@-@ like feature that is 300 to 400 m thick . The central peak is about 2[MASK]0 m in heig[MASK]t . 
 The continuous shadows in the south polar craters cause the floors of these formations to maintain a temperat[MASK]re that never exceeds about 100 K. For Shackleton , the average temperature was dete[MASK]mined to be about 90 K , reaching 88 K at the crater floor . Under these conditions , the estima[MASK]ed r[MASK]te of loss from any ice in the interior would be 10 − 26 to 10 − 27 m / s . An[MASK] water vapor that arrives here following a cometary impact on the Moon wou[MASK]d lie permanently frozen on or below the surf[MASK]ce . However , the surface albedo of the crater floor matches the lunar far @-@ side , sugges[MASK]ing that there is no expose[MASK] [MASK]urface ice . 
[MASK][MASK]his crater wa[MASK] named after Ernest Henry Shackleto[MASK] , an Anglo @-@ Irish explorer of Antarctica from 1901 until his death in 1922 . The name was officially ado[MASK]t[MASK]d by the International Astronomical Union in 1994 . Nearby craters of note include Shoemaker , Haworth , de Gerlache , Sverdrup , an[MASK] Faustini[MASK]. Somewhat farther away , on the eastern hemisphere of the lunar near side , are the larger craters Amundsen and Scott , named after two other early explorers of the Antarctic continent . 
 
 [MASK] = Exploration = = 
 
 From the perspective of the Earth , this crater lies along the southern limb of the Moon , making observation difficul[MASK] . Detailed mapping of the polar regions and farside of the Moon did not occur until the advent of orbiting spacecraft . S[MASK]ackleton lies entirely within the rim of the immense South Pole @-@ Aitken basin[MASK], which is one of the largest known impact formations in t[MASK]e Solar System . This basin is over 12 kilometers[MASK]deep [MASK] and an exploration of its propert[MASK]es could provide useful information about the lunar interior . 
 A neutron spectrometer on board the Lunar Prospector spacecraft detecte[MASK] enhanced [MASK]oncentrations of hydrogen close to the nort[MASK]ern and southern lunar poles , including the crater Shackleton . At the end [MASK]f t[MASK]is mission in July 1999 , the spacecraft was crashed into the nearby crater Shoemaker in the hope of detecting from Earth @-@ based telescopes an impact @-@ generated plume containing water vapor .[MASK]The impact event did not produce any detectable wat[MASK]r vapor , and this may be an indication that the hydrogen is not in the form of hydrated minerals , or that the impact site did not contain any ice . Alternatively [MASK] it is possible that the crash did not excavate deeply[MASK]enough into the regolith to liberate signi[MASK]icant quantities of water vapor . 
 From Earth @-@ based radar and spacecraft images of the crater edge , Shackleton appe[MASK]rs to be relatively intact ; much like a young crater that has[MASK]not been significantly eroded from subsequent impacts . This may mean that the inner sides are relatively steep , which may make traversing the sides relativ[MASK]ly difficult for a r[MASK]botic vehicl[MASK] . In addition , it is possible that the interior floor might not have collected a significant quantity of volatiles si[MASK]ce its formation . However other craters in the vicinity are considerably older , and may contain significan[MASK] deposits of hydrogen , possibly in the form of wat[MASK]r ice . ( See Shoema[MASK]er ( lunar crater ) , f[MASK]r example . )[MASK]
 Radar studies preceding and following th[MASK] Lunar Prospe[MASK]tor mission demonstrate that the inner walls of Shackleton are similar in reflective characteristics to thos[MASK] of some sunlit craters . In partic[MASK]lar , the surroundings appear to contain a significant number of blocks in it[MASK] ejecta blanket , suggesting that its radar properti[MASK]s are a [MASK]esult of surface r[MASK]ughness [MASK] and not ice deposits , as was previously s[MASK]ggested from a radar experiment [MASK]nvolving the Clementine mission . This interpretation [MASK] however , is not universally agreed[MASK]upon within th[MASK] scientific community . [MASK]adar images of the crate[MASK] at a wavelength of 13 cm show no[MASK]evidence for water ice deposits . 
 Op[MASK]i[MASK]al ima[MASK]ing inside the crater was done for the first tim[MASK] by the Japanese lunar orbiter [MASK]pacecraft Kaguya in 200[MASK] . It did not have any evidence of significant amount of water ice , down to the image resolution of 10 m per pixel . 
 On November 15 [MASK] 2008 , a 34 @-@ kg probe made a hard [MASK]anding near the crater . The moon[MASK]impact p[MASK]obe ( M[MASK]P ) was launched from the Indian Chandrayaan @-@ I spacecraft and reache[MASK] the surface 25 min[MASK]tes later . The probe carried a radar altime[MASK]er , video imaging system , and a mass spectrometer , which will be used to search for water .

 Some sites along Shackleton 's r[MASK]m receive almos[MASK] constant illumination . At these locales sunlight is almost always available for conversion into electricity using solar[MASK]panels , p[MASK]tentially making them good locations for future Moon landings . The temperature at this site is also more favorable than at more equatorial latitudes as it does not experience the daily temperature extremes of 100 ° C when the Sun is overhead , [MASK]o as low as − 150 ° C during the lunar night . 
 While scientific experiments performed by Clementine and Lunar Prospector could indicate the presence of water in the polar craters , the curren[MASK] evidence is far fro[MASK] definitive . There ar[MASK] doubt[MASK] among scientists as to whether or [MASK]ot the hydrogen is in the form of ice , as well as to the concentration of this [MASK] ore " with depth below the surface . Resolution of this issue will require future miss[MASK]ons to the Moon . The presence of wa[MASK]er suggests that the crater floor could potentially be " mined " for deposits of hyd[MASK]ogen in water form , a commodity that is expens[MASK]ve to del[MASK]ver directly from the Earth . 
 This crater has also been proposed as a future site for a large infrared telescope . Th[MASK] low temperature of the crater floor makes it ideal for infr[MASK]red observations , and solar cells placed along the rim could provide near @-@ continuous power to the observatory . About 120 kilometers from the crater lies th[MASK] 5 @-@ km tall M[MASK]lap[MASK]rt Mountain , a peak that is perpetually visible from the Earth ,[MASK]a[MASK]d which [MASK]ould serve as a radio relay station when suitably e[MASK]uipped . 
 NASA has named the rim of Shackleton as a potential candidate for its lunar outpost , slated to be up and running by 2020 and [MASK]ontinuously staffed by a crew[MASK]by 2024 . The location would promote [MASK]elf @-@ sustainability for lunar residents , as per[MASK]etual sunlight on the south pole would provide e[MASK]ergy for solar panels . Furthermore , the shadowed polar regions are believed to contain the frozen water necessary for human consumption an[MASK] could also be harvested for fuel manufacture . 
 
 
 = America[MASK] Beauty ( 1999 film ) = 
 
 American Beauty is a 1999 American drama film directed by Sam Mendes and written by Alan Ball . Kevin Spacey [MASK]tars as Lester [MASK]urnham , a 42 @-@ year @-@ old advertising ex[MASK]cutive who has [MASK] midlife crisis when [MASK]e becomes infatuated with his teenaged daughter 's best fr[MASK]end , Angela ( Mena Suvari ) . Annette Bening co @[MASK]@ st[MASK]rs as Lester 's [MASK]aterialistic wife , Carolyn ,[MASK]and Thora Birch plays their in[MASK]ecure daughter , Jane . Wes Bentley , Chris Cooper , and Allison Janney also feat[MASK]re . The film is descr[MASK]bed by academics as a satire of American middle @-@ class notions of beauty [MASK]nd personal satisfaction ;[MASK]analysis has focused on th[MASK] film 's explo[MASK]ations of romantic , and paternal[MASK]love , sexuality , beauty , mater[MASK]alism , self @-@ liberation , and redemption . [MASK] Ball began writing American Beauty as a play in the early 1990s , part[MASK]y inspired by the media circus around the A[MASK]y Fisher trial in 1992 . He shelved the [MASK]lay after realizing the story would not w[MASK]rk [MASK]n stage . After several years as a television screenwriter , Ball revived the idea [MASK]n 1997 when attemp[MASK]ing to break into the film industry . The modified [MASK]cript had a cynical outlook that was infl[MASK]enced by Ball 's frustrating tenures writing for several sitc[MASK]ms . Producers Dan Jinks and Bruce Cohen took American Beauty to DreamWorks ; the then @-@ fledgling film st[MASK]dio bought Ball 's script for $ 250 @,@ 000 , outbidding several other production bodies . DreamWorks financed the $ 15 million[MASK]production and ser[MASK]ed as its North American distributor . [MASK]merican Beauty marked acclaimed theater director Men[MASK]es ' film debut ; courted after [MASK]is successful productions of the musicals Oliver ! and Cabare[MASK] , Mendes was , nevertheless , only given the job after 20 others were conside[MASK]ed and several " A @-@ list " directors turned down the opportunity . 
 Spacey was Mendes ' first choice for the role of Lester , though DreamWorks had urged the director to consider better [MASK]-@ known actors ; similarly , the studio suggest[MASK]d several actors for the role [MASK]f Carolyn[MASK][MASK]ntil Mendes offered the part t[MASK] Bening without DreamWorks ' knowledge . Principal photogr[MASK]phy took plac[MASK] betwee[MASK] December 1998 and Feb[MASK]uary 1999 on soundstages at the Warner Bros. backlot in Burbank , California , and on location in Los Angeles . Mendes ' dominant style was deliberate and composed ; he made[MASK]extensive use of static shots and slow pans and zooms to generate tensi[MASK]n . Cinematographer Conrad Hall complemented Mendes ' styl[MASK] with peaceful shot compositions to contrast with the turbulent on @-@ screen events . During editing , Mendes made several changes that gave the film a less[MASK]cynical tone than the script . 
 Released in North America on September 17 , 1999 , American Beauty was positively received by critics and audiences ; it was the best @-@ reviewed American fi[MASK]m of the year an[MASK] grossed over $ 356 million worldwide .[MASK]Reviewers praised most aspects of the production , with particular emphasis [MASK]n Men[MASK]es , Spacey , and Ball ; criticism focused on the fami[MASK]iarity of the characters and setting . D[MASK]eamWorks launched a major campaign to increa[MASK]e the film 's chances of Academy Award success ; at the 72nd Academy Awards the following year , th[MASK] film won Best Pictur[MASK] , Best Director , Best Actor ( for Spacey ) , [MASK][MASK]st Original Screenplay , and Best Cinematography . It was nominated for and won many other awards and [MASK]onors , mainly for the direction , wr[MASK]ting , and acting . 
 
 = = Plot = = 
 [MASK] Lester[MASK]Burnham is a middle @-@ aged advertising executive and magazine wr[MASK]ter who despises his job[MASK]. He is unhappily married to Carolyn , a neur[MASK]tic yet [MASK]iercely ambitious real estate broker ; their teenaged daughter , Jane , abhors her parents and h[MASK]s low s[MASK]lf @-@ esteem . The Burnhams ' new neighbors are retired United Stat[MASK]s Marine Corps Colonel Frank Fitts and his near @-@ catatonic wife , Barbara . Th[MASK]ir teenaged son , Ricky , constantly films[MASK]his surrou[MASK]dings with a camcorder , collecting hundreds of recordings on videotapes in his bedroom . His job as a part @-@ time bar caterer serves as a front for his secret [MASK]arijuana dealing . Col. Fitts is a strict discipli[MASK]arian who previously sent Ricky to a military school and briefly committed him to a psychiatric hospital . Jim Olmey[MASK]r and [MASK]im Berkley , a g[MASK]y couple who live nearby , welcome the family to the neighborhood ; the homophobic Col. [MASK]itts [MASK]ngrily asks Ricky " why these faggots have to rub it in y[MASK]ur face . " 
 Lester becomes infatuated with Jane 's vain friend , Angela Hayes , after seeing her perform a half @-@ time dance routine at a high school basketball game . He starts having sexual fantasies about Angela , in which red rose petals are a recu[MASK]ring motif .[MASK][MASK]arolyn begins an af[MASK]air with her married business rival , Buddy Ka[MASK]e .[MASK]When Lester 's boss , Brad , tells him that he is to be laid off , Lester instead blackmails him for $ 60 @,@ 000 and quits[MASK]his job . Lester takes a minimum @-@ wage job at a fast @-@ food restaurant , trad[MASK]s in his Toyota Camry for his dream car , a 1970 Pontiac Firebird , and starts working out after he overhears Angela tell Jane that she would find him sexually[MASK]attractive if he got in [MASK]hape . He begins smoking marijuana supplied by Rick[MASK] . The girl[MASK] ' friendship wanes after Jane s[MASK]ar[MASK]s a relationship with R[MASK]cky . Jane and Ricky bond ov[MASK]r what Ricky considers the most beautiful imagery he has filmed : a plastic bag being blown in the wind . 
 Lester discovers Carolyn 's infidelity , but reacts indifferently .[MASK]Buddy ends the affair , fearing [MASK]n expe[MASK]sive divorce . Col. Fitts becomes [MASK]uspicious of Lester and Ricky 's friendship when he finds his son 's footage of Lester lifting weights while nude , which Ricky captured by chance , leading him to [MASK]elieve that Rick[MASK] is gay . After spying on Ricky and Lester[MASK]through Lester 's ga[MASK]age window , the colonel mistaken[MASK]y concludes the [MASK]air is sexually involved . [MASK]e later confronts and beats Ricky for the s[MASK]pposed affair and acc[MASK][MASK]es him of being g[MASK]y . Ricky falsely admit[MASK] the charges and [MASK]oads [MASK]is father into kicking him out of their home . Meanwhile , Carolyn is sitting in her c[MASK]r in the rain , taking a gun out of the glove box while a voice on the radi[MASK] talks about not b[MASK]ing a victim . Ricky goes to Jane 's bedroom , finding her arguing with Angela about Angela 's flir[MASK]atio[MASK] with Lester . Ricky convinces Jane to flee with him to New York City and assures Angela that she is [MASK]gly , boring , and ordinar[MASK] . 
 Col. Fitts confronts Lester and attempts to kiss him ; Lester rebuf[MASK]s [MASK]he colonel , who tearfully flees . Carolyn puts the [MASK]un in her handba[MASK] , shouting , " I refuse to be a victim !

 = = = Multiple i[MASK]terpretations = =[MASK]= 
 [MASK] Scholars and[MASK]academics have offered many pos[MASK]ible readin[MASK]s of Ameri[MASK]an Beauty ; film critics are similarly divided , not so much about the[MASK]quality of the film , as their interpretations of i[MASK] . Described[MASK]by many as about " the meaning of life " or " the hol[MASK]ow existence of the American suburbs " , the film has defied categorization by even the filmma[MASK]ers . Mendes is indecisive , saying the script seemed to be about somethin[MASK] different each time he [MASK]ead it : " [MASK] mystery [MASK]tory , a kaleidoscopic journey through American suburbia , a series of love stories ; [ ... ] it was about impr[MASK]sonment , [ ... ] loneliness , [ and ] beauty . It was funny[MASK]; it was angry , sad . " The liter[MASK]ry critic and author [MASK]ayne C. Booth concludes that the[MASK]film resists any one interpretation : " [ American Beauty ] cannot be adequately summarize[MASK] as ' here is a satire on what 's wrong with American life ' ; that plays down the celebration of beauty . It is more tempting to summa[MASK]ize it as ' a portrait of the beauty underlying Amer[MASK]can miseries and misdeeds ' , but that plays down the scenes of cruelty and horror[MASK], and Ball 's disgust with our mores [MASK] It cannot be summarized with either[MASK]Lester or Ricky 's philosophical statements about wh[MASK]t life is or how one should live [MASK] " He argues that the problem of interpreting the film is tied with that of finding its cen[MASK]er — a controlling voice who " [ unites ] all of the choices " . He conten[MASK]s that i[MASK] American[MASK]Beauty 's case , it is neither Mendes nor Ball . Mendes considers the voice to be Ball 's , but[MASK]even while the writer was " strongly influential " on set , he often had to accept deviations from his vision , particularly ones that transformed the cynical tone of his script into something more optimistic . Wi[MASK]h " innumerable voices intruding on the original author 's , " Booth says , those who interpret American Beauty " h[MASK]ve forgotten to probe for the elusive center " . According to Booth , the film 's true controller is the creative energy " that hundreds of people put into its production , agreeing [MASK]nd disagreeing , inserting and cutting " . 
 
 = = = Imprisonment and redemption =[MASK]= = 
 
 Mendes called American Beauty a rite of passage film about imprison[MASK]ent and escape from imprisonment . [MASK]he mo[MASK]otony of Lester 's existence is es[MASK][MASK]blished through his gray , nondescript w[MASK]rkpl[MASK]ce and [MASK]haracterless cloth[MASK]ng . In these scenes , he is often framed as if trapped , " reiterating rituals that hardly please him " . He masturb[MASK]tes in the confines of hi[MASK] shower ; the shower stall evo[MASK]es a jail cell and the shot is the first of many where Lester is confined [MASK]ehind bars or within frames , such as when he is refl[MASK]cted behind columns of numbers on a computer m[MASK]nitor , " confined [ and [MASK] nearly crosse[MASK] out " . The academic and author Jody W.[MASK]Pennington argues that Lester 's journey is the [MASK]tory '[MASK] center . His sexual reawakening through meeting Angela is t[MASK]e first [MASK]f several turning points as he begins to " [ throw ] off the responsi[MASK]i[MASK]ities of the com[MASK]ortable life he has come to despise " . After Lester shares a joint with R[MASK]cky , hi[MASK] spirit is released an[MASK] he begins to rebel against Carolyn . Changed by Ricky 's " attractiv[MASK] ,[MASK]profound confiden[MASK]e " , Lester is convinced that Angela is attainable and sees that he must question his " banal , numbingly materialist suburban existence " ; he tak[MASK]s a job at a[MASK]fast @-@ food outlet , which allows him to regress to a point when he could " see his whole life ah[MASK]ad of him " . 
 When Lester is caught masturbating by Carolyn , his angry retort about their lack of intimacy is the first time he says aloud what he thinks about her . By confronting the[MASK]issue and Carolyn 's " superficial investments in others " , Lester is trying to [MASK] regain [MASK] voice in a home that [ only resp[MASK]cts ] t[MASK]e voices of mother and daughter " . His final turning point comes when Angela and[MASK]he almost have sex ; after she confesses her virginity , he no lo[MASK]ger thinks of her as[MASK]a sex object , but as a [MASK]aughter . He ho[MASK]ds her close and " wraps her up " . Mendes called it " th[MASK] most satisfying end to [ Lester[MASK]'s ] jour[MASK]ey there[MASK]could possibly have been " . With these final scenes , Mendes intended to show Lester at the conclusion of a " mythical quest " . After Lester gets a[MASK]beer from the refrigerator , the camera pushes toward him , then stops facing a hallway down [MASK]hich he walks[MASK]" to mee[MASK] his fate " . Having begun to act [MASK]is age again[MASK], Lester achieves closure . As he smiles at a family photo , the camera [MASK]ans slowly from Lester to the kitchen wall , onto which blood [MASK]patters as a gunshot r[MASK]ngs out ; the slow pan reflects the peace of Lester 's death . His body is discove[MASK]ed by Jane a[MASK]d Ricky . Mendes said that Ricky 's staring into Lester 's dead eyes is " the culmination of the theme " of the film : that beauty is found where it is least expected . 
 
 = = = Conformity and[MASK]beauty = = = 
 
 Like other American films of 1999 — such as Fight Club , Bringing Out the Dead , and Magnolia , American Beauty instructs its audience to " [ lead ][MASK]more meaningful lives " . The film argues the case against conformity , bu[MASK] does not deny that people need and want it ; even the gay characters just want to fit in . Jim and Jim , the Burnhams ' other neighbors , are a satire of " gay bourgeois co[MASK]pledom " , who " [ [MASK]nvest ] in the numbing sameness " that [MASK]he film criticizes [MASK]n heterosexual couples . The fe[MASK]i[MASK]ist academic and author Sally R. Munt argu[MASK]s that American Beauty uses its " art house " trappings to direct its message of nonconformity primarily to the [MASK]iddle classes , and that this approach is a " cliché of bourgeois pre[MASK]ccupation ; [ ... ] the underlying premise being that the luxury of finding an individual ' self ' through denial and renunciation is always open to those wealthy en[MASK]ug[MASK] to choose , and sly enough to present themselves sympathetically as a rebel . " 
 Professor[MASK]Roy M. Anke[MASK] argues that the film 's thematic center is its direction to th[MASK] audience to " look closer " . The opening combines an unfamiliar viewpoint of the Burnhams ' neighbo[MASK]hood with Lester 's narrated admission that he will soon die , forcing audiences to consider their own mortality and the beauty around them . It also sets a series [MASK]f mysteries ; Anker asks , " from what place exactly , and from what state of being , is he telling this story ? If he 's already dead , w[MASK]y bother with whatever it is he wishes to tell about[MASK]his last y[MASK]ar of being alive ? There is also the question of how Lester has died — or wi[MASK]l die . " Anker believes[MASK]the preceding scene — Jane 's disc[MASK]ssion with Ricky ab[MASK]ut the possibility of his killing her father — ad[MASK][MASK] further mystery . Professor Ann C. Hall disagrees ; she says by presenting an early res[MASK]lution to the mystery ,[MASK]the film a[MASK]lows the audience[MASK]to put it aside " to view the film and its philoso[MASK]hica[MASK] issues " . Through this examination of Lester 's life , rebirth and death , American Beauty satirizes American middle class notions of meaning , beauty and satisfaction . Even Leste[MASK] 's transf[MASK]rmation only comes about because of the possibility of sex with Angela ; he therefore remains a " willing devotee of the popular media 's exaltation of pubescent male sexuality as a sensible route to personal w[MASK]oleness " . Carolyn[MASK]is similarly driven by conventional views of h[MASK]ppiness ; from her belief in " [MASK]ouse beautiful " domestic bliss to her car and gardening outfit , Carolyn 's domain is a " fetching American m[MASK]llennial vision of Pleasantville , or Eden " . Th[MASK] Burnhams are unaware that they are " materialists philosophically , [MASK]nd devout consumers ethically " who expect the "[MASK]rudiments of American beauty " to give them happiness . Anker argues that " they are[MASK]helpless in [MASK]he fa[MASK]e o[MASK] the prettified economic and sexual stereotypes [ ... ] that they and th[MASK]ir culture have designated for th[MASK]ir salvation . " 
 The film presents Ricky as its " visionary , [ ... ] spiritual and mystical center " . He sees beauty in the minutiae of everyday life , [MASK]ideoing as much as he can for [MASK]e[MASK]r of missing it . He shows Jane what he considers the most beautiful [MASK]hing he has filmed : a plastic bag[MASK], tossing in the wind in front of a wall . He says capturing the moment was when he realized that there w[MASK]s "[MASK]an e[MASK]tire life behind things " ; he feels that " sometimes the[MASK]e 's so much beauty in the world[MASK]I f[MASK]el like I can 't take it ... and my heart is going [MASK]o cave in . " Anker argues that Ricky , in looking past[MASK]the "[MASK]cultural [MASK]ross " , has " [ grasped ] the radiant splendor of the created world " to see God . As the film progresses , the Burnhams mo[MASK]e clos[MASK]r to Ricky 's view of the world . Lester on[MASK]y forswears personal satisfaction at the fi[MASK]m 's end . On the cusp of having sex with Angela , he returns to himself after she adm[MASK]ts[MASK]her virginity . Suddenly confronted with a child , he begins to treat her as a[MASK]daughter ; in doing so , Lester sees himself , Angela , and his family " for the poor and fragile but wondrous creatures the[MASK] are " . He looks at[MASK]a picture of his family in happier times , and dies having had an epiph[MASK]ny that infuses him with " wonder , joy , a[MASK]d soul @-@ shaking gratitude " — he has final[MASK]y seen the world as it is . 
 According to Patti Bellantoni , colors ar[MASK] u[MASK]ed symbolically [MASK]hroughout the film , none more so [MASK]han red , which is an important thematic signature that drives the story and " [ de[MASK]ines ] Lester 's arc " . F[MASK]rst seen in drab colo[MASK]s that reflect his pas[MASK]ivity , Les[MASK]er surro[MASK]nds himself with red as[MASK]he regains his indi[MASK]iduality . The American Beauty ros[MASK] is repeatedly used as s[MASK]mbol ; when Lester fantasizes[MASK]about An[MASK]ela , she is usually naked and surrounded by rose petals . In these scenes , the rose symbolizes Lester 's desire for her . When ass[MASK]ciated with Carolyn , the rose represents a " façade for suburban success " . Ro[MASK]es are included in almost every shot inside the Burnhams ' home , where they si[MASK]nify " a mask cov[MASK]ring a bleak , unbeautiful reality " . C[MASK]rolyn feels that " as long as there can be roses , all is well " . She cuts the roses and puts them in vases , where they adorn her " meretricious vision of what makes for beauty " and begin to die . The roses in the vase in the Angela – Lester seduction scene symbolize Lester 's previous life and Carolyn ; the camera pushes in as Lester and Angela get closer , finally taking the roses — and thus Carolyn — out of the shot .[MASK]Lester 's epiphany at the end of the film is expressed by rain and the use of red , building to a crescendo that is a deli[MASK]erate contrast to the release Lester feels . The[MASK]constant use of red " lulls [ the audience ] subliminally " into becoming used to it ; consequently , it leaves the audience unprepared when Lester is shot and his blood spatters on the wall . 
 
 = = = Sexuality [MASK]nd repress[MASK]on = = = 
 
 Penningt[MASK]n argues that[MASK]American Beaut[MASK] defines its characters through their sexuality . Lester 's attempts to relive his youth are a direc[MASK] result of his lust for Angela , and the state of his relationship with Carolyn is in part shown through their lack of sexual contact . Also sexually frustrated , Carolyn has an affair that takes her from " cold perfectionist " to a more carefree soul w[MASK]o " [ sings ] happily a[MASK]ong with "[MASK]the mus[MASK]c in her car . Jane and Angela constantly reference sex , t[MASK]rough Angela 's descripti[MASK]ns of her supposed sexual encounters and the way the gi[MASK]ls address each other[MASK]. Their nude scenes are used to communicate their vulnerability . By the end of the film [MASK] Angela 's hold on Jane has weakened until the only power she has over her friend is Lester 's attrac[MASK]ion to her . Col. Fitts reacts with disgust to meeting Jim and Jim ; he asks , " How come these faggots always have to rub it in your face ? How can they be so shameless ? " To whic[MASK] Ricky replies , " That 's the thing , Dad — [MASK]hey don 't feel like it 's anythi[MASK]g to be ashamed of . " Penn[MASK]ngton argues that Col. Fitt[MASK] ' reaction is not homophobic , but an " anguished self @-@ interrogation " . 
 With o[MASK]her turn @-@ of[MASK]@-@ the @-@ millennium[MASK]films such as Fight Club , In the Company of Men ( 1997 ) , American Psycho ( 2000 ) , and Bo[MASK]s Don 't Cry ( 1999 ) , American Beauty " raises the broader , widely explored issue of masculinity in crisis " . Professor [MASK]incent Hausmann charges[MASK]that in their reinforcement of masculinity " against threats p[MASK]sed by war , by consumerism , and by feminist and queer challenges " , these films pre[MASK]ent a need to " focus on , and even t[MASK] privilege " aspects of maleness " deemed ' devi[MASK]nt ' " . Lester 's transf[MASK]rmation conveys " that he , and not the woman , has borne the brunt of [ lack of being ] " and he will not stand for being emasculated . Les[MASK][MASK]r 's attempts to[MASK]" strengthen traditional masculinity " conflict with his responsibilities a[MASK] a father . Although the film portrays the wa[MASK] Lester returns to that role positiv[MASK]ly , he does not become " the hypermasculine [MASK]igure implicitly celebrated in films like Fight Club " . Hausmann concludes that Lester 's behavior toward Angela[MASK]is " a misguided but nearly necessary step toward his becoming a father again " . 
 Hausmann says the film " explicitly affirms the importance of upholding the prohibition against incest " ; a recurring theme of Ball 's work is his comparison of the taboos a[MASK]ainst [MASK]ncest[MASK]and homosexuality . Instead [MASK]f making a[MASK] over[MASK] distinction , American Beauty looks at how their repre[MASK]sion can lead to violence . [MASK]ol. Fitts is so ashamed of his homosexuality that it drives him to murder Lester[MASK].[MASK]Ball said , " The movie is in part a[MASK]out how homophobia is based in fear and repression[MASK]and about what [ they ] can do . " The film implies two unfulfilled incestuous desires : Lester 's pursuit of Ang[MASK]la is a manifestation of his lust f[MASK]r his own daughter , while Col. Fitts ' repr[MASK]ssion is exhibited through the almost sexuali[MASK]ed discipline with which he controls Ricky . Consequently , Ricky realiz[MASK]s that he can only hurt his father by falsely telling him he is homosexual , while Angela 's vulnerability and submission to Les[MASK]er reminds him of his responsibilities and the limits of his fantasy . Col. Fitts represents Ball 's father , whose repressed homosexual [MASK]esires led to his own unhappiness . Ball rewrote Col. Fitts to delay revealing him as homosexual , whi[MASK]h Munt reads as a possible " deferment of Ball 's own patriarchal @-@ incest fant[MASK]sies " .

 American Beauty follows a traditional narrative structure , on[MASK]y deviating with the displaced openin[MASK] scene o[MASK] Jane and Ricky from the middle of the story . Although the plot spans one year , the film is narrated by Lest[MASK]r at the moment of his death . Jacqueline Furby says [MASK]hat the plot " occupies [ .[MASK]. ] no time [ or ] all time " [MASK] ci[MASK]ing Les[MASK]er 's claim that life did not flash before his eyes , but that it " stretche[MASK] on forever like an ocean of time " . Furby argu[MASK]s that a " rhythm of repetition " forms[MASK]the core of the film 's structure . For example , two scenes have the Burnhams sitting down to an evening meal , shot from the same angle . Each i[MASK]age is broadly similar , [MASK]ith min[MASK]r differences in object placement and body language that reflect the changed dynamic brought on [MASK]y Lester 's new @-@ found assertiveness . Another ex[MASK]mple[MASK]is the pair of scenes in which Jane and Ricky film each other . Ricky films Jane from his[MASK][MASK]edroom window as she removes her bra , and the imag[MASK] is reversed later[MASK]for a similarly " voyeuristic and exhibitionist " scene in which[MASK]Jane films Ricky at a vulnerable moment . 
 Lester 's fantasies are emphasized by slow- a[MASK]d repetitive @-@ motion shots ; Mendes uses double [MASK]-@ and @-@ tri[MASK]le cutbacks [MASK]n several sequences , and the score alters to make the audience aw[MASK]re that it is entering a fantasy . One example i[MASK] the gymnasium [MASK]cene — [MASK]ester 's first enc[MASK]unter with Angela . While the cheerleaders perform t[MASK]eir ha[MASK]f @-@ time routine to " On Broadway " , Leste[MASK] becomes increasingly fixated on Angela . Time slows to represent his " voyeuristic hypnosis " and Lester begins to fantasize that Angela 's performance is for him alone . " On Broadway " — which provides a conve[MASK]tiona[MASK] underscore to the onscreen action — is replaced by discordant , percussive music that lacks melody or progression . This nondiegetic score is important to c[MASK]e[MASK]ting the narrative stasis in the sequence ; it conveys a moment for Lester that is stretched to an i[MASK]deter[MASK]inate length . The effect is one that Stan Link likens to " vertical time " , [MASK]escribed by[MASK]the compo[MASK]er and music theorist Jonathan Kramer as music[MASK]that imparts " a single [MASK]resent stretched out[MASK]into an enormous duration , a[MASK]potentially infinite [MASK] now ' that nonetheless feels like an instant " . The music is used like a visual cue , so that Lester an[MASK] the score are staring at Ang[MASK]la . The sequence ends with the sudden reintroduction [MASK]f " On Broadway " and teleological time . 
[MASK]According to Drew Miller of Stylus , the soundtrack " [ gives ] unconscious voice " to the characters ' psyche[MASK] and comple[MASK]ents the subtext .[MASK]The most obvious use of pop music " accompanies and gives context to " Lester 's attem[MASK]ts to recapture his youth ; reminiscent of how the counterculture of the 1960s combated American repression through music and drugs , Lester begins to smoke cannab[MASK]s[MASK]and list[MASK]n to rock music . Mendes ' song choices " progress through the history of American popular music " . Miller argues that although some may [MASK]e over familiar , there is a parodic element at work , " making good on [ the film 's ] e[MASK]co[MASK]ragement that viewers look closer " . Toward the end of the film , Thomas Newman 's score features more prominently , creating " a disturb[MASK]ng tempo " that matches the tension of the visuals . The exception is " Don 't L[MASK]t It Bring You Down " , which plays during Angela 's seduction of L[MASK]ster . At first appropriate , its tone cla[MASK]hes as the[MASK]seduction stops . The lyrics , which speak of " castles burning " , can be seen as a metaphor for Lester 's view of Angela — " the rosy , fantasy @-@ driven exterior of the ' American Beauty '[MASK]" — as it burns away to reveal " the timid , small @-@ bre[MASK]sted girl who , like his wife , has willfully developed a false publ[MASK]c self " .

 In 1997 , Alan Ball resolved to move into t[MASK]e film industry after several fru[MASK]trating years writing [MASK]or the televisio[MASK] sitcoms Grace Under Fire and Cybill . He joined the United Talent Agency , where his representative , Andrew Cannava , suggested he write a spec script to " reintrod[MASK]ce [ himself ] to the town as a screenwriter " . Ball pit[MASK]hed three ideas to Cannava : two conventional romantic comed[MASK]es and American Beauty , wh[MASK]ch he had origi[MASK]ally conce[MASK]ved as a play in the early 1990s . Despite the story 's lack of an ea[MASK]ily marketable c[MASK]ncept , Cannava selected American Beauty beca[MASK]se he felt it was the one for which Ball had the most passion . While developing the script , Ball created another television sitcom ,[MASK]Oh , Grow[MASK]Up . He channeled his anger and frustration at having to accede to network demands on that show [MASK] and during his tenures on Grace Under Fire and Cybill — into writing American Beau[MASK]y . 
 Ball did not expect to sell the[MASK]script , believing it would act as more of a calling card , but American Beauty drew interest from several production bodies . Cannava passed the script to several producers , including Dan Jinks and Bruce Cohen , who took it to DreamWorks . With the help of executives Glenn Williamson and Bob Cooper , and Steven Spielberg in his capacity as studio partne[MASK] , Ball was convinced to develop the project at DreamWork[MASK] ; he received assurances from the studio — known at the time for its more conventional fare — that it would not " iron[MASK]the [ edges ] out " . In an unusual mo[MASK]e , DreamWorks decided not [MASK]o option th[MASK] script ; instead , in April 1998 , the st[MASK]dio bought it outrig[MASK]t for $ 250 @,@ 000 , outbi[MASK]ding Fox Searchlight Pictures , October Films , Metro @-@ Goldwyn @-@ Ma[MASK]er , and Lakeshore Entertainment . DreamWorks planned to make the film for $ 6 – 8 million . 
 Jinks and Cohen involved Ball throughout the film 's development , including casting [MASK]nd director selection . The producers met with about 20 interested directors , several of whom were considered " A @-@ list " at the time . Ball was not keen on the more well @-[MASK][MASK]known[MASK]directors because he believed t[MASK]eir involvement [MASK]ould increase the budget and lead DreamWorks to become " nervous about the content " . Nevertheless , the [MASK]tudio offered the film to Mike Nichols and Robert Zeme[MASK]kis ; ne[MASK]ther accepted . In the same year , Mendes ( then a theater direc[MASK]or ) revived the musical Cabaret in New York with fel[MASK]ow director Rob Marshall . Beth Swofford of t[MASK]e Creative Artists Agency arranged meetings for Mendes with studio figures in Los Angeles to see if[MASK]film direction was a possibility . Mendes came across American Beauty in a pile of eight scripts at Swofford 's hou[MASK]e , and knew immedi[MASK]tely that it was[MASK]the one he wanted to make ; early in his career [MASK] he had been inspired by how the film Paris , Texas ( 1984 ) presented contemporary America as a mythic landscape and he [MASK]aw the same theme in A[MASK]erican Beauty , as well as parallels with [MASK]is own childh[MASK]od . Mendes later met w[MASK]th Spielberg ; impressed by Mendes ' productions of Oliver ! and Cabaret , Spielberg encouraged him to consider American Beauty . 
[MASK]M[MASK]ndes found that he still h[MASK]d to convince [MASK]reamWo[MASK]ks ' production exec[MASK]tives to let him direct .[MASK]He had already discussed the film with Jinks and Cohen , and fel[MASK] they supported him . Ball was also keen ; having seen Cabaret , he was impressed with Mendes ' " keen visual sense " and thought he did not make obv[MASK]ous choices . Ball felt that Mendes liked to look under the story 's surface , a tale[MASK]t he felt would be a go[MASK]d fit with the themes of American Beauty . Mendes '[MASK]background also reassured him , because of the prominent role t[MASK]e playwright usually has in a theater production . Over two meetings — the first with Cooper , Wa[MASK]ter Parkes , and Laurie MacDonald , the second with Cooper alone — Mendes pitched himself to t[MASK]e studio . The studio soon approached Mendes with a deal to direct for the minimum salary allowed under Directors Guild of America rules — $ 150 @,@ 000 . Mendes accepte[MASK] , and later recalled that after taxes and his agent 's commission , h[MASK] only earned $ 38 @,@ 000 . In June [MASK]998 , DreamWorks confirmed that it had contract[MASK]d Mendes to direct the film .

 Ball was partly inspired by two[MASK]encounters he had in the early 1990s . In about 1991 – 92 , Ball saw a plastic bag blowing in the wind outside the World Trade Center . He watched the bag for [MASK]0 minutes , saying later th[MASK]t[MASK]it provoked an " unexpected emotional response " . In 1992 , Ball became preoccupied with the media circus around the Amy Fisher trial . Discoverin[MASK] a comic book telling of the scandal , he was struck by how quickly it had become commercialized . He said he " felt like there was a real story underneath [ that was ] more fascinati[MASK]g and way more tragic " than the story presented to th[MASK] public , and attempted to turn the idea [MASK]nto a play . Ball produced around 40 pages , but stopped when he realized it would work bet[MASK]er as a film . He felt that because of the [MASK]isual themes , and becaus[MASK] [MASK]ach character [MASK]s story was .. " inte[MASK]sely personal " , it could not be done on a stage . All[MASK]the main character[MASK] appeared in this version , but Carolyn did not feature strongly ; Jim and Jim instead had much larger ro[MASK]es . 
 Ball based Lester 's story on aspects of his own life . Lester 's re @-@[MASK]exa[MASK]ination of [MASK]is life parallels feelings Ball had in his mid @-@ 30s ; like Lester , Ball put aside his passions to work in jobs he hated for people he did not respect . Scenes in Ricky 's household reflect Ball 's own childhood[MASK]experiences . Ball suspected his father was homosexual and used the idea to create Col. Fitts , a man who " gave up his chanc[MASK] to be himself " . Ball said the script 's mix o[MASK] comedy and drama was not inten[MASK]ional , but that it came unconsciously from his own out[MASK]ook on life . He said the juxtaposition produ[MASK]ed a starker cont[MASK]ast , giving each trait more impa[MASK]t than if they appeared alone .[MASK]
 In the script that w[MASK]s sent to prospective actors and directors , Lester and Angela had se[MASK] ; by the time of shooting [MASK] Ball had rewritten the scene to the final version . Ball initially [MASK]ebuffed counsel from oth[MASK]rs that he change the script , feeling they were being puritanical ; the final impetus to alter the scene came from DreamWorks ' then @-@ president Walter Parkes . He convinced Ball by indicating that in Greek mythology , the hero " has a m[MASK]ment of[MASK]epiphany before [ ... ] tragedy occurs " . Ball l[MASK]ter said his anger when writing the first draft had bli[MASK]ded him to the idea that Lester needed to refuse sex with Angela to complete his emotional journey — to achieve redemption . Jinks and Cohen asked Ball n[MASK]t to alter the scene rig[MASK]t away , as they felt it would be inap[MASK]ropriate to make changes to the scrip[MASK] before a di[MASK]ector had been hired . Early drafts also included a flashback to Col. Fitts ' service in the Marines , a sequence that unequivocally established his homosexual leanings . In love with anothe[MASK] Mar[MASK]ne , Col. Fitts sees the man die and comes to believe that he is being punished for the " sin " of being gay . Ball re[MASK]oved the sequence because it did not fit t[MASK]e structure of the rest of the film — Col. Fitts was the only character to have[MASK]a flashback — and because it removed the[MASK]element of surprise from Col[MASK] Fit[MASK]s ' later pass at Lester . Ball said he had to write it for his own benefit to know wha[MASK] happened to Col. Fitts , though all that remained in later drafts was subtext . 
 Ball remained involved throughout production ; he had signed a television show development dea[MASK] , so had to get permission from his p[MASK]oducers to take a year off to be cl[MASK]se to[MASK]American Beauty . Ball was on @-@ set for rewrites and to help interpret his script for all but two days of filming . His origi[MASK]al bookend scenes — in whic[MASK] Ricky and Jane are prosecuted fo[MASK] Lester 's murder after[MASK]being framed by Col. Fitts — were excised in [MASK]ost @-@ production ; [MASK]he writer later fe[MASK]t the scenes w[MASK]re unnecessary , saying they were a reflection of his " anger and cynicism " at the ti[MASK]e of [MASK]riting ( see " Editing " ) . Ball and Mendes revised the s[MASK]ri[MASK]t twice before it was sent to the actors , and twice more before the first read[MASK]@-@ through . 
 Th[MASK] shooting script features a scene in Angela 's car in which Ricky and Jane talk abo[MASK]t death and beauty ; the scene differed from e[MASK]rlier versions , [MASK]hich set it as a " big scene on a freeway " in which the three wi[MASK]ness a car crash and see a dead body . The change was a practical decision , as t[MASK]e production[MASK]was behind[MASK]schedule and they needed to cut costs . The schedule called for two days to be spent filming the crash , but on[MASK]y half a day was available . Ball agreed , but only if t[MASK]e scene could retain a line of Ricky 's where he reflects on having once seen a dead h[MASK]meless woman : " When you see something like that , it 's like God[MASK]is looking [MASK]ight at you , just for a second . And if [MASK]ou 're careful , you can look right back . " Jane asks : " And what do you see ? " Ricky : [MASK] Beauty . " Ball said , " They wanted to cu[MASK] that scene . They said it 's not importa[MASK]t . I sai[MASK] , ' You 're out of your fucking mind . It 's one of the most important scenes in the [MASK]ovie ![MASK]' [ ... ] If any one line is the heart and soul of this [MASK]ovi[MASK] , that is the line . "[MASK]Another scene was rewritten to accommodate the loss of the freeway sequence ; set in a schoolyard , it p[MASK]esents a " turning point "[MASK]for Jane in that she chooses to w[MASK]lk home with Ricky instead of going with Angela . By the end of filming , the script had been through[MASK]10 drafts .

 Mendes had Spacey and Bening in mind for the leads from the beginning , but DreamWor[MASK]s executives were un[MASK]nthusiastic . The[MASK]studio suggested several alternatives , including Bruce Willis , Kevin Costner , or John Travolta to p[MASK]ay Lester , and Helen Hunt or Holly Hunter to p[MASK]ay Carolyn . Mend[MASK]s did not want a big star " weighing the film down " ; he felt Spacey was the right choice based on his performances i[MASK] the 1995 films The Usual Suspects and Seven ,[MASK]and 1992 's Glengarry Glen Ross . Spacey was surprise[MASK] [MASK] he said , " [MASK] usually play charact[MASK]rs who are very quick , very manipulative and smart . [ ... ] I usua[MASK]ly wade in dark , sort of treacherous waters . This is a man living one step at a time , playing by his instincts . This is actua[MASK]ly much closer to me , [MASK]o what I am ,[MASK]than those other parts . " Mendes offered Bening the role of Carolyn wi[MASK]hout the studio 's consent ; although e[MASK]e[MASK]utives were up[MASK]et at Mende[MASK] , by September 1998 , DreamWorks had entered negotiations with Spacey and Bening . [MASK] Spacey loosely based Lester 's early " schlubby " deportment on[MASK]Walter Matthau . During the film , Lester 's physique improves fr[MASK]m f[MASK]abby to toned ; Spac[MASK]y worked out during [MASK]ilming to improve his body , but bec[MASK]use Mendes shot the scenes out of chronological order , Spacey varied p[MASK]stures to[MASK]portray the stages .[MASK]Before filming , Mendes and Spacey analyzed Jack Lemmon 's performa[MASK]ce in The Apartment ( 1960 ) , because Mendes wanted Spacey to emulate " the way [ Lemmo[MASK] ] moved , the way he looked , the way he was in that office and the way he was an ordin[MASK]ry man and yet a special man " . Sp[MASK]cey '[MASK] voiceover is a thr[MASK]wback to S[MASK]nset Boulevard [MASK] 1950 ) , which is also narrated in retrospect b[MASK] a dead character . Mendes felt it evoked Lester 's — and the film 's — loneliness . Bening [MASK]ecalled women from her youth to inform her performance : " I used to babysit constantly . You 'd go to church and see how people present themselves on the outside , and the[MASK] be inside their house and see the difference . " Bening and a hair stylist collaborated to create a [MASK][MASK]PTA president coif " hairstyle , a[MASK]d[MASK]Mendes and p[MASK]oduction designer Naomi Shohan researched mail @-@ order catalogs to better establish Carolyn 's environment of a " spotless suburban manor " . To help Bening get into Carolyn 's mindset , Mendes gave her music that he believed Carolyn would like . He lent Bening the Bobby Darin version of [MASK]he song " Do[MASK] 't Rain on My Parade " , which she enjoyed and persuaded the di[MASK]ector to include i[MASK] for a scene in which Carolyn sings in her car . 
 For the[MASK]roles of Jane , Ric[MASK]y , and Angela , DreamWo[MASK]ks gave Mendes carte [MASK]lanche[MASK]. By November 1998 , Thora Birch , Wes Bentle[MASK] , and Mena Suvari had been c[MASK]st in the parts — in Birch 's case , despite the fact she was underage for her nude scene . As Birch was 16 at the time she made the film , and thus classified as a minor in the United[MASK][MASK]tates , her parents had to approve [MASK]er br[MASK]ef topless scene in the movie . Child labor representatives and they were on the set for [MASK]he shooting of the scene . Bentley overcame competition from top actor[MASK] under t[MASK]e age of 25 to be cast . The 2009 doc[MASK]mentary My Big Break followed Be[MASK]tley , and several other young actors , before and after he landed the part [MASK] To prepare , Mendes provided Bentley with a video camera , telling the actor to film what Ricky would . Peter Gallagher and Alison Janney were cast ( as Buddy Kane and Barbara Fitts ) after filming began in[MASK]December 1998 . Mendes gave Janney a book of paintings by Edvard Munch [MASK] He tol[MASK] he[MASK] , " Your character is in there somewhe[MASK]e . " Mendes cut much of Barbara 's dialogue ,[MASK]including conv[MASK]rsations between Colonel Fitts and her , as he felt that what needed to be said a[MASK]out the pair — their humanity and vulnerability — was conveyed successfully through their shared moments of [MASK]ilence . Chris Cooper plays[MASK]Colonel Fitts , Scott Bakula plays Jim Olmeyer , and Sam Robards p[MASK]ays Jim Berkley . Jim and Ji[MASK] were deliberately depicted as the most [MASK]ormal , happy — and boring — couple in the film .[MASK]Ball 's [MASK]nspiration for the characters[MASK]came from a thought he ha[MASK] after s[MASK]eing a " [MASK]land , boring , heterosexual couple " who w[MASK]re matchi[MASK]g clothes : " I can 't wait for the time when a gay couple can be just as boring . " Ball also included aspects of a gay couple he knew who [MASK]ad the sa[MASK]e forename . 
 Mendes insisted on two weeks of cast rehearsals , although the sessions were not as formal as he was used to in the theater , and the [MASK]ctors could n[MASK]t be present at [MASK]very one . Several improvisations and sugg[MASK]stions by the actors were incorporated into the script . An [MASK]arly scene showing the Burnhams leaving home for work was inserted later on to show the low point that Carolyn[MASK]and Lester 's relationship had reached . Spacey and Bening worked to create a sense of the love that Lester and Carolyn once had for o[MASK]e another ;[MASK]for[MASK]example , the scene in which Lester almost seduces Carolyn after [MASK]he pair argues [MASK]ver Lester 's buying a car was origin[MASK]lly " strictly contentious " .

 Principal photography [MASK]asted about 50 days from Dec[MASK]mber 14 , 1998 , to February 1999 . American Beauty was f[MASK]lmed on soundstages at the Warner Bros. backlot in Burbank , Californ[MASK]a , and at Hancock Par[MASK] and Brentwood in Los Angeles . The aerial shots at the [MASK]eginning a[MASK]d end of the film were captured in Sacramento ,[MASK]California[MASK], and many of the school scenes were s[MASK]ot at South High School in Torrance , California ; several extras in[MASK]the gym crowd were[MASK]South High students . The film is set [MASK]n an upper middle @[MASK]@ class neighborhood i[MASK] an unidentified American town . Production desig[MASK]er Naomi Shohan likened the locale to Evanston , Illinois , but [MASK]aid , " it 's not about a place , it 's about an archetype . [ ... ] The milieu was[MASK]pretty much Anywhere , USA[MASK]— upwardly mobile suburbia . " [MASK]he intent was [MASK]or th[MASK] setting to reflect the characters , who are also archetype[MASK] . Shohan said , [MASK] All of them are very strained , and their lives are constructs . " T[MASK]e Burnha[MASK]s ' househo[MASK]d was designed as the r[MASK]verse o[MASK] the Fitts ' — the former a pristine ideal , but[MASK]graceless and lacking in " inner balance " , leading to Carolyn 's desire to at least give it the appearance of a " perfect all @-@ American household " ; the Fitts ' home is depicted in " exaggerated darkness [ and ] symmetry " . 
 The production selecte[MASK] two ad[MASK]ace[MASK]t properties on the Warner backlot 's " Blondie Street " for the B[MASK]rnham and Fitts ' homes . The crew rebuilt the houses to incorporate false rooms that esta[MASK]lished lines of sight — between Ricky and Jan[MASK] 's bedroo[MASK] w[MASK]ndows , and between Ricky 's bedroom and Lester 's garage . The garage wi[MASK][MASK]ows were designed specifically to obtain the crucial shot toward the end of the film in which [MASK]ol. Fitts — watching from Ricky 's bedroom — mistakenly as[MASK]umes that Lester is paying Ricky for sex . Mendes made sure to establish the line of sight early on in the film to make[MASK]the audience feel a[MASK]sense of familiarity with the shot . Th[MASK] house interiors were filmed on the backlot , on location , and on soundstages when overhead shots were ne[MASK]ded . The [MASK]nside of the Burnhams ' home was shot at a house close to Interstate 405 and Sunset Boulevard in Los Angel[MASK]s ; the inside of the Fitts ' h[MASK]me was shot in the city 's Hancock Park neighborhood . Ricky 's bedroom was designed to be cell @-@ like to suggest his " monkish " persona[MASK]ity , while at the same time blending with the high [MASK]-@ tech equipment to reflect his voyeuristic side . The production deliberately minimized the use of re[MASK] , as it was an important thematic signature elsewhere . The Burnhams ' home uses c[MASK]ol blues , while the Fitts ' is kept in a " depressed m[MASK]litary palette " . 
 Mendes ' dominating vi[MASK]ual style was deliberate and composed , with a minimalist desig[MASK] that provided " a sparse , almost surreal feeling — a bright , crisp , hard e[MASK]ged , near Magritte @-@ like[MASK]take on American suburbia " ; Mendes constantly directed his set dressers to empty the frame .[MASK]He made Lester 's fantasy scenes " more fluid and graceful " , and Mendes made minimal use of steadicams , feeling that stable shots generated [MASK]ore [MASK]ension .[MASK]For example , when Mendes used a slow push in to the Burnhams ' dinner table , he held the shot because his tra[MASK]ning as a theater director taught him the importance[MASK]of putting [MASK]istance between the characte[MASK]s . He wanted to keep the tension in the scene , so he only cut away when Jane left the t[MASK]ble . Mendes did use a[MASK]hand @-@ held camera for the scene in which Col. Fitts bea[MASK]s Ricky . Mend[MASK]s said the cam[MASK]ra provided the s[MASK]ene with a " kinetic [ ... ] off @-@ bala[MASK]ce energy " . [MASK]e also[MASK]went hand @-@ held for the excerpts of Ricky 's camcorder footage . Mendes took a long time to ge[MASK] the quality of Ricky [MASK]s footage to the level he wanted . For the plastic @-@ bag f[MASK]ot[MASK]ge , Mendes used wind machin[MASK]s to move the bag in the air . The scene took four takes ; two by the second unit did not satisfy Mendes , so he shot th[MASK] scene himself . He felt his first take lacked grace , but for the last attempt , he changed the location to the front[MASK]of a brick wall and added leaves on the ground . Mendes was satisfied by the way the wall g[MASK]ve definition to the outline of the bag . 
 Mendes avoided usin[MASK] close @-@ ups , as he believed the technique was overused ; he also cited Spielberg '[MASK] advice that he should imagine an audience silhouetted at the bottom of the camera monitor , to keep in mind that he was[MASK]shooting for display on a 40 @-@ foot ( 10 m ) screen . Spielberg — who visited the set a few times — also advised Mendes not t[MASK] worry about costs if he had a " great idea " toward the end of a long wor[MASK]ing day . Mendes said , " That happened three or four times , and they are all in the movie . " Despite Spielberg 's suppo[MASK]t , DreamWorks and Mendes fought constantly over the schedule and budget , although the studio interfered little with the film 's content . Spacey , Bening and Hall worked f[MASK]r significantly less[MASK]than their usual rates . American Beauty cost DreamWorks $ 15 mill[MASK]on to produce , [MASK]lightly above their projected sum . Mendes was so dissatisfied with his first three days ' filmin[MASK] that he obtained perm[MASK]ssion from DreamWorks to reshoot the scenes . [MASK]e[MASK]said , " I started with a wrong scene [MASK] actually , a comedy scene . And the actors played it way too big : [ ... ] it was badly shot , my fault , badly composed , my fault , bad costumes , my fault [ ... ] ; and everybody was doing what I was asking . It was all my fault . " Aware that he was a no[MASK]ice , Mendes dre[MASK] on the experience of Hall : " I mad[MASK] a very conscious decision early on , if I did[MASK] 't understand something technically , to say , without embarrassment , ' I don 't understand what you 're talking ab[MASK]ut , please ex[MASK]lain it . ' " 
 Mendes encour[MASK]ged some improvisation ; for example , when Lester masturbates in bed beside Carolyn , the director asked Spacey to improvise[MASK]several euph[MASK]misms for the act in each take . Mendes said , " I wanted that not just because it[MASK]was funny [ ... ] but because I didn 't want it to seem rehearsed . I wanted it to seem like h[MASK] was blurting it out of his mouth without thinking . [ Spacey ] is[MASK]so in control — I want[MASK]d him to break through . " Spacey oblig[MASK]d , eventually coming up with 35 phras[MASK]s ,[MASK]but Bening could not alwa[MASK]s keep a straight face , which meant the scene had [MASK]o be shot 10 times . The production used small amounts of com[MASK]uter @-@ generated imagery . Most of the [MASK]ose petals in Lester 's fantasies were add[MASK]d in post @-@ production , although some were real and had [MASK]he wires hol[MASK]ing the[MASK] digitally [MASK]emoved . When Lester fantasizes about Angela in a rose @-@ petal bath , the steam was real , save for in the overhead shot . To position th[MASK] camera , a hole had to be cut in the ceiling , through which t[MASK]e steam escaped ; it was instead added digitally [MASK]

 American Beauty was edited by Christopher Greenbury and Tariq Anwar ; Greenbury began in the position , bu[MASK] had to leave halfway through post @-@ production because of a scheduling conflict with Me , Myse[MASK]f and Ire[MASK]e ( 2000 ) ( [MASK][MASK] which Chris Cooper also starred ) . Mendes and an assistant edi[MASK]ed the film for 10 days between the appointments . Mendes reali[MASK][MASK]d during editing that the film was different from the one he ha[MASK] envisioned . He believed he had been making a " [MASK]uch more whimsical , [ ... ] [MASK]aleidoscopic " film than what came together in the edit suite . Instead , Mendes was drawn to the emotion and dark[MASK]ess ; he began to use the score and shots he had intended to discard to craft the film along these lines [MASK] In total , he cut about 30 mi[MASK]utes from his original edit . The opening included a dr[MASK]am in which Lester imagines h[MASK]mself flying above the town . Mendes spent two days fil[MASK]ing Spacey against bluescreen , but remove[MASK] the sequence as he believed it to b[MASK] too whimsical — " like a Coen brothers movie " — and therefore [MASK]nappropriate for the tone he was trying to set . The opening in the fina[MASK] cut reused a scene from the middle of the film where Jane tells Ri[MASK]ky to k[MASK]ll her father . This scene was to be [MASK]he revelation to the audience that the pair was not responsibl[MASK] for Leste[MASK] 's death , as the way it was scored and acted made it clear that Jane 's request was not serious . However , in the portion he used in the opening — and when the full s[MASK]ene plays out later — Mendes used the score and a reaction shot of Ricky to leave a lingering ambiguity as to his guilt . The s[MASK]bsequent shot — an aerial view of the neighborhood — was originally intended as the plate shot for the bluescreen effects in the dream sequence . 
 Mendes spent more time recutting the first 10 minutes than the rest of the film taken together . He trialled several versions of the opening ; the fir[MASK]t e[MASK]it included bookend scene[MASK] in [MASK]hich Jane and Ricky are convicted of Lester 's murder , but Mendes excised these in the last week of editing because he felt they made the film lose its mystery , and because they did not fit with the theme[MASK]of redemptio[MASK] that had emerged during production . Mendes b[MASK]lie[MASK]ed the trial drew focus away from the characters and turned th[MASK] film " into[MASK]an episode of NYPD Blue " . Instead , he wanted the ending to be " a poetic mixture of dream and memory and narra[MASK]ive resolution " . When Ball first saw a completed edit , it was a ver[MASK]ion with truncated versions of these scenes . He felt that they were so s[MASK]ort that they " didn 't really register " . Mendes and he argued , but Ball was mo[MASK]e accepting af[MASK]er Mendes cut the sequences completely ; Ball felt that without the scenes , the film [MASK]as more optimistic and had [MASK]volved into some[MASK]hing that " for all its darkness had a really romantic heart " .

 Conrad Hall was not t[MASK]e first choice fo[MASK] director of photography ; Mendes believed he was " too old and too experienced " to want the job , and he had been told that Hall was difficult to wor[MASK][MASK]with . Instead , Mendes asked Fred Elmes ,[MASK]who turned the j[MASK]b down because he did not like the script . Hall was recommended to Mendes by Tom Cruise , because of Hall 's work on[MASK]Without Limi[MASK]s ( 1998 ) , which Cruise had executive produced . Mendes was directing Cruise 's th[MASK]n @-@ [MASK]ife Nicole Kidman in the p[MASK]ay The Blue Room during preproduction on American Beauty , and had [MASK]lready storyboarded the who[MASK]e film .[MASK]Hall was involved for one month during[MASK]preproduction ; his ideas for lighting the film began with his first reading of the script[MASK], and further passes allowed him to refine his approach before me[MASK]ting Mend[MASK]s . Hall was initially concerned that audiences would not like the c[MASK]aracters[MASK]; he only felt able to identify with them during cast rehearsals , [MASK]hich gave him fresh ideas on his approach to the [MASK]isuals . 
 Hall 's approach was to create peaceful compositions that evoked classicism , to contrast with the turbulent on [MASK]-@ screen events and allow audiences to take in the action . Hall and Mendes first discussed the intended mood of a sce[MASK]e , bu[MASK] he was allowed to light the shot in any way he felt necessary . In most cases , Hall first[MASK]lit the scene 's subject by " painting in " the blacks and whites , before adding fill ligh[MASK] , which he reflected from beadboard or white c[MASK]rd[MASK]on the ceiling . This approach gave Hall more c[MASK]ntrol over the shadows while keeping the fill light unobtrusive and the dark [MASK]rea[MASK] free of spill . [MASK]all shot American Beauty in a 2 @.@ 39 : 1 aspect ratio in the Supe[MASK] 35 format , using Kodak Vision 500T 5279 35 mm film stock . He used Super 35 partly because its larger scope allowed [MASK]im to capture elements su[MASK]h as the corners of the peta[MASK] [MASK]-@ filled pool in its overhead shot , creating a frame around Angela within . He shot the[MASK]whole film at the same T @-@ stop ( T1.9 ) ; given his preference for shooting that wide , Hall favored high @-@ speed stocks to allow f[MASK]r more subtle lighting effects . He used Panavision Platinum cameras[MASK]wit[MASK] t[MASK]e company 's Primo series of prime and zoom lenses . Hall employed Kodak V[MASK]sion 200T 5274 and EXR 5248 stock for scenes with daylight effects . He had difficulty adjusting to Kodak 's newly in[MASK]roduced Vision re[MASK]ease print stock , which , combined with[MASK]his c[MASK]ntrast @-@ heavy lighting [MASK]tyle , created a look with too much contrast . Hall [MASK]on[MASK]acte[MASK] Kodak , who sent him a batch of 5279 that was 5 % lower[MASK]in contrast . Hall used a 1 / 8 inch Tiffen Black ProMist filter for alm[MASK]st every scene , which he said in retrosp[MASK]ct may not hav[MASK] been the best choice , as the optical [MASK]teps required to blow Super 35 up f[MASK]r its anamorphic release print[MASK]led to a slight amount of degradation ; therefore , the diffusion from the filter was not required . When he saw the film[MASK]in a theater , Hall felt that the image was slightly unclear a[MASK]d that had he not used the fil[MASK]e[MASK][MASK], the diffusion from the Supe[MASK] 35 – anamorphic conversion would have generated an image closer to what he originally intended . 
 A shot[MASK]where[MASK]Lester and Ricky s[MASK]are a canna[MASK]is joint behind a building came from a misunderstanding between Hall and Mendes . Mendes asked Hall to prepare the shot in his absence ; Hall assumed the characters would look for privacy , so he placed them in a narrow passage between a truck and the building , intending to light fro[MASK] the top of the truck . When Mendes ret[MASK]rned , [MASK]e explained that the c[MASK]aracte[MASK]s did not care if they were seen . He removed the truck and Hall had to rethink the lighting ; he lit it from the left , with a la[MASK]ge light crossing the actors , and with a soft light behin[MASK] the camera . Hall felt the consequent wide shot " worked perfectly for t[MASK]e tone o[MASK] the scene " . Hall made sure to keep rain , or the suggestion of it [MASK] in every shot near the end of the film . In one shot during Lester 's encounter with[MASK]Angela at the Burnhams ' ho[MASK]e , Hall crea[MASK]ed rain effects on t[MASK]e foreground cross[MASK]ligh[MASK]s ; in an[MASK]ther , he partly lit the pair through French windows to which he had added material to m[MASK]ke the r[MASK]in run slower , intensifying the light ( [MASK]lthough the strength of the outside light was unrealistic for a night scene , Hall fel[MASK] it justified b[MASK]cause[MASK]of the str[MASK]ng contrasts it produced ) . For the close @-@ ups when Lester and Ang[MASK]la move to the couch , Hall tried to keep rain in the frame , lighting through the window onto the ceiling behind Lester . He also used rain boxes to produce rain patterns where he wa[MASK]ted [MASK]ithout lighting the [MASK]ntire room .

 Thomas Newman 's score was recorded in Sant[MASK] Monica , California . He mainly used percussion instruments to creat[MASK] the mood and rhythm , the inspiration for which was provided by Mendes [MASK] Newman " favored pulse[MASK], rhythm , and color over melody " , making for a more minimalist score than he had previously created . He b[MASK]ilt each cue around " small , endlessly repeating phrases " — often , the only variety[MASK]through a " thinning of the texture for eight[MASK]bars " . The percussion instruments included tablas[MASK][MASK] bon[MASK]os , cymbals , piano , xylophones , a[MASK]d mari[MASK]bas ; also featured were guit[MASK]rs , flute , and wo[MASK]ld music instruments . [MASK]ewman also used electronic music and on " quirkier " tracks employed more unorthodox methods , such as ta[MASK]ping metal mixing bowls with a fing[MASK]r and using a detuned mandolin . Newman believed the score helped move the film along w[MASK]thout[MASK]disturbing the " moral ambiguity " of the scrip[MASK] : " It was a real delicate bal[MASK]ncing act in term[MASK] of what music worked to preserve [ that ] . " 
 The soundtrack features songs by Newman , Bobby[MASK]Darin , The Who , Free , Eels , The Guess Who , Bill Withers , [MASK]etty Carter , Peggy Lee[MASK], The Folk Implosion , Gomez [MASK] and Bob Dylan , as well as two cover versions — The Beatles ' " Because " performed by Elliott Smith , a[MASK]d Neil Young 's " Don 't Let It Bring You Down " performed by Annie Lennox . Produced by the film 's music supervisor Chris Douridas , an abridged soundtrack[MASK]album[MASK]was released on October 5 , 1999 , and went[MASK]on to be nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Soundtrack Album . An album featuring 19 tracks from Newman 's score was released on January 11 , 2000 , and won the Grammy Award for Best Score Soundtrack Album . Filmmaker considered the score to be one of Newman 's best , saying it " [ enabled ] the film 's transcendentalist aspirations " . In 2006 , the magazine chose the score as one of 20 essential soundtracks it believed spoke to the " complex and innovative relationships between music and screen storytelling " .

 DreamWorks contracted Amazon.com to create the official website , marking the f[MASK]rst time that Amazon had created a special section devoted t[MASK] a feat[MASK]re film . The websi[MASK]e included an[MASK]overview , a photo gallery , cast and [MASK]rew filmographies , and exclusive interviews with Spacey and Bening . The film 's tagline — " l[MASK]ok closer " — originally came [MASK]rom a cutting pasted on Lester[MASK]'s workplace cubicle by the set dresser . DreamWorks ran p[MASK]rallel marketing campaigns and trailers — one aimed at adults , the other at teenagers . Both trailers ended with the poster image [MASK]f a girl holding a rose . Reviewing the posters of several 1999 films , David Hochman of Entertainment Weekly rated American [MASK]eauty 's highly , saying it evok[MASK]d the tagline ; he said , " You retu[MASK]n to the poster again and again [MASK] thinking , this time you 're gonna find somethi[MASK]g . " DreamWorks di[MASK] no[MASK] wan[MASK] to test screen the film ; according to Mendes , the studio was pleased with [MASK]t , but he i[MASK]sisted on one[MASK]where he could question the audience afte[MASK]ward . The st[MASK]dio reluctan[MASK]ly agreed and showed the film t[MASK] a young audience in San Jose , California . Mendes claimed the screening went[MASK]very well .

 American Beauty was released on VHS on May 9 , 2000 , and on DVD with the DTS format on October 24 ,[MASK]2000 . Before the N[MASK]rth American[MASK]rental release on May 9 , Blockbuster Video wanted to purchase hundreds[MASK]of thousands of extra copies for its " guaranteed title " rang[MASK] , whereby anyone who wanted to rent the fil[MASK] would be g[MASK]aranteed a copy . Bl[MASK]ckbuster and DreamWorks could not agree on[MASK]a profit @-@ sharing de[MASK]l[MASK], so Blockbuster ord[MASK]red two @-@ thirds the number of copies it originally intended . DreamWorks made around[MASK]one mi[MASK]lion copies available for[MASK]rental ; Blockbuster 's share w[MASK]uld usually have been about 400 @,@ 000 of these . Some Blockbuster stores only displayed 60 copies , and others d[MASK]d [MASK]ot display [MASK]he film at all , forcing customers to ask for it . The strategy required staff to read a statement to cu[MASK]tomers explaining the situation ; Blockbuster claimed it was only " [ monitoring ] custome[MASK] demand " due to the reduced ava[MASK]lability . Blockbuster 's strategy leaked before May 9 , leading to a 30 % o[MASK]der increase from other retailers . In its first week of rental release , American Beauty made $ 6 @.@ [MASK] million . This retur[MASK] was lower than wo[MASK]ld have been[MASK]expected h[MASK]d DreamWorks and Blockbuster reached an agreeme[MASK]t . In the sa[MASK]e year , The Si[MASK]th Sense made $ 22 million , while Fight Club made $ 8 @.@ 1 million , though the latter 's No[MASK]th American theatrical performance was just 29 % that of American Beauty [MASK] Blockbuster 's strategy also [MASK]ffected rental fees ; American Beauty averaged $ 3 @.@ 12 , compared with $ 3 @.@ 40 for films that Blockbuster fully promoted .

 American Beauty was widely considered the best film of[MASK]1999 by the Americ[MASK]n press . It received overwhelming praise , chiefly for Spacey , Mendes and B[MASK]ll[MASK][MASK] Variety rep[MASK]r[MASK][MASK]d that " no other 1999 movie[MASK]h[MASK]s benefited from such universal raves . " It was the best @-@ received title at the Toronto International Film Festival ( TIFF ) , where it won the People 's C[MASK]oice [MASK]ward after a ballot of t[MASK]e festival '[MASK] audience[MASK] . TIFF 's director , Piers Hand[MASK]ing , said , " American Beauty was the buzz of the festival , the film mo[MASK]t talked @-@ about . " 
 Writing in Variety , Todd McCarthy sai[MASK] the cast ensemble " could not be bett[MASK]r " ; he praised Spacey 's "[MASK]handling of innuendo ,[MASK]subtle sarca[MASK]m , and blunt talk " and the way he imbued Lester with[MASK]" genuine feeling " . Janet Maslin in The New York Times said Spacey was at his " wittiest and most agile " to date , and Roger Eber[MASK] of the Chicago Sun @-@ Times singled Spacey out for successfully p[MASK]rtraying a man w[MASK]o " does reckless and foolish things [ but who ] doesn 't deceive himsel[MASK] " . Kevin[MASK]Jackson of Sight & Sound said Spacey impressed in ways distinct from his previ[MASK]us performances , the most satisfying aspect being his portrayal of " [MASK]oth sap and hero " . Writing in Film Quarterly , Gary Hentzi praised the ac[MASK]ors , but said that characters such as Carolyn and Col. Fitts w[MASK]re st[MASK]reotypes . Hentzi accused Mendes and Ball of identifying too readily with Jane a[MASK]d Ricky , saying the latter was their " fantasy figure " — a teenaged boy who 's an absurdly wealthy artist able to " finance [ his ][MASK]own projects " . Hentzi said Angela was the most believable teenager , in particular with he[MASK] " painfully [MASK]amiliar " attempts to " live up to an unworthy image of herself " . Maslin agreed that s[MASK]me characters were unoriginal , but said their detailed characterizations made them memorable . Kenneth Turan of the Los Angeles Times said the actors coped " faultlessly " with what wer[MASK] difficult roles ; he called Spacey 's pe[MASK]formance " the energy that drives the film[MASK]" , saying the actor command[MASK]d a[MASK]dience involvement despite Lester not always being[MASK][MASK]ympathetic .[MASK]" Against considerable odds , we do like [ these characters ] , " Turan conclu[MASK]ed . 
 Ma[MASK]lin felt that Mendes directed with " terrific visual flair " , saying his minimalist style balanced " the mordant and bright " and that he evoked the " delicate , eroticized power @-@ playing vignettes " of his theater work . Jackson said Mendes ' theatrical roots [MASK]arely showed , and that th[MASK][MASK]" most remarkable " aspect was[MASK]that Spacey 's performance did not overshadow the film . He said that Mendes worked the script 's intricacies smoothly , to the ensemble 's strength[MASK] , and stag[MASK]d the tonal shifts skillfully . McCarthy believed[MASK]American Beauty a " st[MASK]nning car[MASK] of introduction[MASK]" for film débutantes Mendes an[MASK] Ball . He [MASK]aid Mendes ' " sure hand " was " as precise and contr[MASK]lled " as his theater work . McCarthy cited Hall '[MASK] inv[MASK]lvement as fortun[MASK]te for Mendes , as the cinematographer was " unsurpassed " at conveying the th[MASK]mes of a wor[MASK] . Turan agreed that Mendes ' choice of collab[MASK]rators was " shrewd " , naming Hall and Newman in particula[MASK] . Turan sugg[MASK]st[MASK]d that America[MASK] Beauty may ha[MASK]e benefited[MASK]from[MASK]Mendes ' inexperience , as his " anythi[MASK]g 's possible daring " made hi[MASK] attempt beats th[MASK]t more seasoned directors might have avoided .[MASK]Turan felt that Mendes ' a[MASK]complishment was to " capture and enhance [ the ] duality " of Ball 's scri[MASK]t — the simult[MASK]neously " caricatured [ ... ] and painfully real " characters . H[MASK]ntzi , while critical of many of Mendes and Ball 's choices , admitted the film showed off their " considerable talents " . 
 Turan cited Ball 's lack of constraint when writing the film as the reason for its uniqueness ,[MASK]in particular the script 's subtle changes in tone[MASK]. McCarthy said the script was " as fresh and d[MASK]stinctive " as an[MASK] of its American film contemporari[MASK]s , and praised how it analyzed the characters while not [MASK]ompromis[MASK]ng narrative pace . He called[MASK]Ball 's dialogue " tart " and said the characters — Caroly[MASK] ex[MASK]epted — were " deeply drawn " . One o[MASK]her flaw[MASK], McCarthy s[MASK]id , was the re[MASK]elation of Col. Fitts ' homo[MASK]exuality , which he said evo[MASK]ed " hoary Freudiani[MASK]m " . Jackson said the film transcended its clichéd setup to become a " wonderfully resourceful and sombre comedy " . He said that even when the film played for sitcom laughs , it did so with " u[MASK]expe[MASK]ted nuance " . Hentz[MASK] criticized how the film ma[MASK]e a mystery of Lester 's murder , believing it ma[MASK]ipulative and simply a way of[MASK]generating suspense . McCarthy cited the production and co[MASK]tume design as[MASK]pluses , and said the soundtrack was good at creating " ironic counterpoint [ s ] " to the story . Hentzi concluded that American Beauty was " vital but uneven " ; he felt the film 's examination of " the ways whic[MASK] teena[MASK]ers and adults imagine each other 's lives " was its best point , a[MASK][MASK] tha[MASK] although Lester a[MASK]d Angela 's dynamic was fami[MASK]iar , its romantic irony stood beside " the most[MASK]enduring literary treatments " of the theme ,[MASK]such as Lolita . Nevertheless ,[MASK]Hentzi believed that the fil[MASK] 's themes of materialism and conformity in American sub[MASK]rbia were " hackneyed " . McCarthy conceded that the setting was fami[MASK]iar , but said it [MASK]erely provided the film with [MASK] " st[MASK]rting point " from which to tell its " [MASK]ubtle and acutely judged tale " .[MASK]Maslin agreed ; she said that while it " takes aim at targets that are none to[MASK] fresh " ,[MASK]and that the theme of nonconformity did not surprise , the film had its own " corrosive novelty " . Ebert awarded American Beauty four stars out of four , and Turan said it was layered , subversive , complex , and surprising [MASK] con[MASK]lud[MASK]ng it was " a hell of a[MASK]picture " . 
 A few months after the film 's release , repor[MASK]s of a backlash a[MASK]pear[MASK]d in the American[MASK]press , and [MASK]he years[MASK]s[MASK]nce have[MASK]seen its critical rega[MASK]d wane . In 2005 , Premiere named American Beauty as one of 20 " most overrated movies of all ti[MASK]e " ; Mendes accepted the inevitability of the critical reappr[MASK]isal , saying , " I thought [MASK]ome of it was entirely justified — it wa[MASK] a little overpraised at the time . " 
 Currently , the film holds an 88 % score on Rotten Tomatoes based on 180 reviews , with an average rating of [MASK] @.@ 2 / 10 ; the critical consensus reads , " Flawlessly cast and brimming with[MASK]da[MASK]k , acid wit , American Beauty is a smart , pr[MASK]vocative high point[MASK]of late ' 90s mainstream Hollywood film . " Meta[MASK]r[MASK]tic gives the film a score of 86[MASK],[MASK]based on 33 reviews , indicating " univ[MASK]rsal acclaim . "

 American Be[MASK]uty was not considered an immediate favorite to [MASK]ominate the American awards season . Several other contenders opened at the end of 1999 , and US critics spread their honors among them when compiling their end [MASK]-@ of @-@ year lists . The Chicago Film Critics Association and the Broadcast Film Critics Association named the f[MASK]lm the best of 1999 , but while the New York Film Critics C[MASK]rcle , the Na[MASK]ional Society of Film [MASK]ritics and th[MASK] Los Angeles Film Critics Association [MASK]ecogn[MASK]zed American Beauty , they gave their top awards[MASK]to other f[MASK]lms . By the end of the year , reports o[MASK] a critical ba[MASK]klash suggested [MASK]merican Beauty was [MASK]he[MASK][MASK]nderdog i[MASK] the race for Best Pictu[MASK]e ; however , at the Golden Glob[MASK] Awards in January 2000 , [MASK]merican Beauty won Best Film , Best Director and Best Screenplay . 
 A[MASK] the nominations for the 72nd Academy Awards a[MASK]p[MASK]oached [MASK] a frontrunner h[MASK]d not emerged . DreamWorks[MASK]had launche[MASK] a major campai[MASK]n for American Beaut[MASK] five weeks before ballots were due to be sent to the 5 @,@ 600 Academy Award [MASK][MASK]ters . Its campaign combined traditional a[MASK]vertising and publicity with more focused strategies . Although direct mail campaigning was prohibited , DreamWorks reached voters by promoting the film in " casual , comfortable se[MASK]tings " in voter[MASK] ' comm[MASK]nities . The studio 's candidate for B[MASK]st Picture the previous year , Saving Private Ryan , lost to Shake[MASK]peare in Love , so the studio took a new approach by hiring ou[MASK]siders to provide input fo[MASK] the [MASK]ampaign . It hired three veteran consultants , who told the[MASK]studio to " think small " . Nan[MASK]y Willen[MASK]encouraged Dr[MASK]amWorks to pr[MASK]duce a special abo[MASK]t the making of American Beauty , to set up dis[MASK]lays of the fil[MASK] in th[MASK] com[MASK]unities ' bookstores , and to arrange a q[MASK]estion @-@ [MASK]nd @-@ answer session with Mendes for the British Academy of Film and Television Arts . Dale Olson advised the studio to advertise in free publications that circu[MASK]ated in [MASK]everly Hills — home to many voters — in addition to major n[MASK]wspaper[MASK] . Olson arr[MASK]nged to screen American Beau[MASK][MASK] to abo[MASK]t 1 @,@ 000 members of the Actors Fund of America , as many particip[MASK]ting actor[MASK] were also voters . Bruce Feldman [MASK]ook Ball to the Santa Barbara International Film Festival , where B[MASK]ll attended a private dinner in h[MASK]nor of Anthony Hopkins , meeting several voters who were in attendance . 
 In February 2000 , American Beauty was nominated for [MASK]ight Academy Awards ;[MASK]its closest[MASK]rivals , The Cider House Rules and The Insider , received seven nominations [MASK]ach . In March 2000 , the major industry labor or[MASK]anizations all awarded their top honors to[MASK]American Beauty ; perceptions had shifted — the film was now the favori[MASK]e to dominate the Academy Awards . American Beauty 's closest rival [MASK]or Best Picture was still The Cider House [MASK]ules , from [MASK]iramax .

 = Christopher Gore = 
 
 Christopher Gore ( September 21 , 1758 – March 1 , 1827 ) was a prominent Massachu[MASK]etts lawyer , Federalist politician , and U.S. diplomat . Born into a family divided by the American Revolution , Gore sided with the victorious Patriots , established a successful law practice in Boston , and built a fortune by purchasing Revolutionary gover[MASK]ment debts at a[MASK]discount an[MASK] receiving full value for them from the governme[MASK]t . 
 Gore enter[MASK]d politics in 1788 , serving briefly in the Massachus[MASK]tts legislature before being appointed U.S. District Attorney for Massachusetts . He was then appointed by President George[MASK]Washington to a diplomatic commission dealing with maritime claims in Great Britain . He returned to Massachus[MASK]tts in 1804 and reentered state politics , running unsuccessfully for governor several times before winning in 1809 . He served one term , losing to Democratic @-@ Repub[MASK]ican Elbridge Gerry in[MASK]1810 . He was appointed to the US Senate by Governor Cale[MASK] Strong in 1813 , where he led opposition to the War of 1812 . 
 Gore invested his fortune in a variety of businesses , inc[MASK]ud[MASK]ng important infrastructure projects such as the Mid[MASK]lesex Canal and a bridge across the Charle[MASK] River . He was a major investor in the early textile indu[MASK]try , fu[MASK]ding the Boston Manufacturing Company [MASK]nd the M[MASK]rrimack Manufact[MASK]ring Company ,[MASK]whose business established the city of Lowell ,[MASK]Massachusetts . Gore[MASK]was i[MASK]volved in a variety of charitable[MASK]causes , and was a major benefactor of Harvard College , where the first library was named in his honor . His palatial mansion in Waltham , Massachusetts , now known as Gore Place , is one of the finest extant exam[MASK]les of Fede[MASK]al[MASK]st architecture , and has been declared a National Historic [MASK][MASK]ndmark . 
 
 = = Early years = = 
 
 Christopher Gore was born in Boston on September 21 , 1758 , [MASK]ne of many children of Frances and John Gore , a su[MASK]cessful merchant and artisan . He was the youngest of their three sons to survive to adultho[MASK]d . He attended Boston Latin Schoo[MASK] , and entered Harvard College [MASK][MASK] the young ( even for the time ) age of thirteen . At the outset of the American Revolutionary War and the Siege of Bosto[MASK] in 1775 , Harvard 's buildings were occupied by the Continental[MASK]Army , and Gore temporarily co[MASK]tinued his stu[MASK]ies[MASK]in Brad[MASK]ord until Harvard could resume operations in Concor[MASK] . While a[MASK] Harvard [MASK]ore participated in a speaking club , and formed significant lifelong friendships with Rufus King and John Trumbull . 
 Gore graduated in 1776 , and promptly enlisted in the Continental artillery regiment of his brother @-@ in @-@ law Thomas Crafts , where he served as a clerk until 1778 . The Gore family was divided by the war : Gore 's father was a Loyalist who left Boston when the Britis[MASK] Army evacua[MASK]ed the city in March 1776[MASK]. Gore was conseq[MASK]ently called upon to support his mother and three sisters , who remained in B[MASK]ston . In 1779 Gore success[MASK]ully petitioned the state for the remaining fam[MASK]ly 's share of his father 's seized assets . 
 
 = = Early l[MASK]gal career = = 
 
 After his military service Gore studied law with John Lowell , and was admitted to the bar in 1778 after a comparatively brief[MASK]tutelage . Gore 's law practice flourished , in part because many Loyalist lawyers had fled Massachusetts . Gore 's clients included Loyalists seeking[MASK]to recover some of the[MASK]r assets , as well as London @-@ based British merchants with claims to pursue . His briefs were generally well @-@ reasoned , and he was seen as a successful trial lawyer . 
 Gore grew his fortune by investing carefully in revolutionary currency and bonds . The securities he purchased were paper that had been given to Conti[MASK]ental Army soldiers in lieu of pay , which they often sold at a steep discount . One batch of securities he purchased , for instance , cost him about $ 3 @,@ 700 but had a face value of $ [MASK]5 [MASK],@ [MASK][MASK]0 . In 1785 he married Rebecca Amory Payne , daughter of a wealthy merchant , maritime [MASK]nsurer , [MASK]nd director [MASK]f the Bank of Massachusetts . The couple were known for their social[MASK]graces and became prominent members of Boston society . 
 In 1786 Gore became concerned abou[MASK] a ris[MASK] in anti @-@ lawyer sentimen[MASK] in[MASK]Massachusetts . Grievances over harsh policies pursued by Governor James Bowdoin blossomed into Shays ' Rebellion , which required militia action to crus[MASK] in 1787 . Gore was[MASK]one of several[MASK]high @-@ profile l[MASK]wyers assigned to defend participants in the rebellion ( includ[MASK]d in this group were Theodore Sedgwick , Caleb Strong , James Sullivan , Levi Lincoln , Sr. , and Thomas [MASK]awes ) . Although many rebels were ultimately convicted , a large number received amnesty . In 178[MASK] , Gore [MASK]as elected[MASK]a delegate to the[MASK]1789 Massachusetts convention that ratifie[MASK] the United States Constitution . His election was contested[MASK]because Boston , where he liv[MASK]d , was at the time more inclined toward state power . Gore nonetheless was strongly Federalist , u[MASK]ging support of the new Constitution . 
 
 = = Legislator , banker , and speculator = = 
 
 In 1788 Gore wa[MASK] elected to the Massach[MASK]setts House of Representatives . He took a leading role in adopting the state 's rules for actions required of it by the new federal constitution . B[MASK][MASK]his propo[MASK]al the [MASK]egislature decided that presidential electors would[MASK]be chosen by a joint session . He also pro[MASK]osed that the state House and Senate agree [MASK][MASK] separate v[MASK]tes on choices for the United States Senate , a process that would s[MASK]gnificantly reduce popular inp[MASK]t to the choice . His choice was ultimately rejected in[MASK]fa[MASK]or of a process whereby the House selected a slate of candidates , from which the Senate would choose one . In 1789 Gore decide[MASK] to stand for reelecti[MASK]n , but lost , owing to strong anti @-@ nationalist fervor in Boston at the time . He managed to win a seat later ,[MASK]when a special election was held after resignations opened several seats . [MASK] Gore 's financial speculations in the late 1780s significant[MASK]y multiplied his wealth . In 1788 he and Andrew Craigie , a Boston businessman who had retained Gore for legal services , entered into a secret agreement to purchase Continental securities with a face v[MASK]lue of $ 100 @,@ 000 in a speculative bid that their value would rise . By late October[MASK]of that year , the pair had met this goa[MASK] : Gore had purchased $ 90 @,@ 000 worth of paper for about $ 20 @,@ 000 , and encouraged Craigie to purchase more than the $ 1[MASK] @,@ 000 he had acquired if his funding would allow for it . Gore also purchased Massachusetts war @-@ related debts , and [MASK]obbied Massachusetts Congressmen[MASK]for the U.S. governmen[MASK] to assume those as well . 
 Gore 's windfall was realized w[MASK]en in 1790 the United States Congress , acting on a p[MASK]oposal made by Alexander Hamilton and supported by Gore '[MASK] friend Rufus King , passed legisl[MASK]tion that exchanged Continental and state paper for ne[MASK] U.S. paper at face value . Not only did Gore win on this exchange , but the paper he received appreciated in value before he sold it . The exact amount he made is unclear from the surviving documents : Jo[MASK]n Quincy Adam[MASK] wrote that Gore 's speculations made him the wealthi[MASK]st law[MASK]er in the country . 
 The succes[MASK] of Gore 's speculations prompted him to [MASK]nter a partnership with Cra[MASK]gie , Willia[MASK] Duer and Daniel Parker in an attempt to[MASK]acquire U.S. foreign debt obligations on favorable term[MASK] . Par[MASK]er was a business partner of Craigie 's , and Duer was an influential New York businessman and Trea[MASK]ury Department official whose lavish lifestyle impressed Gore . The [MASK]artnership promoted sales of U.S. lands in Europe , and sought to acquire U.S. obligations to Franc[MASK] . Although Gore [MASK]ank $ 10 @,@ 000 into this venture , it failed : more powerful and experienced Dutch bankers outmaneuvered t[MASK]e Americans . Gore also engaged in other ventures with these partners , but apparen[MASK]ly carefully st[MASK]yed with financial speculations , and avoided the partners ' less succe[MASK]sful land ventures . 
 Much of Gore 's financial activ[MASK]ty was mediated throu[MASK]h[MASK]the Bank of Ma[MASK]sachusetts , where his father @-@ in @-@ law [MASK]as a director . Gore himself was elected to its board in 1785 , when he also became a shareholder . During his time on the board the bank tig[MASK]tened its regulations on loan repayments , a move th[MASK]t improved[MASK]the sta[MASK][MASK]lity of its capital .[MASK]Gore used the bank [MASK]or most of his personal deposits[MASK], but also drew o[MASK] line[MASK] o[MASK] credit for [MASK]s much as[MASK]several thousand dollars . The bank shares he held paid relatively high dividends until 1791 , when the bank received serious competition f[MASK]om the First Bank of the United States . 
 The Bank of the United States was established by Alexa[MASK]der Hamilton to provide stable banking services on a national sca[MASK]e , and sought to open a branch in Boston . H[MASK]milton[MASK][MASK]ecruited heavily in the Bank of Massachusetts , and Gore decided to make the move . He sold his shares in the Massachusetts bank , and became a director of the Boston branch of the U.S. Bank . He also pu[MASK]chased 200 shares in the new bank ,[MASK]a relatively large investment . Gore was influential in makin[MASK] hiring [MASK]ecisions for the branch , and sought to merge[MASK]state @-@ chartered banks into the organization , arguing that only a nati[MASK]nally chartered bank could provide consistent and stable service . Gore resigned from the board in 1794[MASK], citing the deman[MASK]s of his law practice . 
 Gore 's financial successes enab[MASK]ed him to[MASK]join the elite society of Boston . In 1789 he purchased a large mansion on fashionable Bowdoin Square , and also bought a country estate in Waltham that grew over [MASK]ime to 300 acres ( 120 ha ) [MASK] He had a hou[MASK]e buil[MASK] on the estate , mo[MASK]t of which he operated as a gentleman farmer . He and other simil[MASK]rly @-@ situated Federalists formed the Massachusetts Society for Promoting Agriculture , of which he served as a trustee for several years ; the organization was not seen as significantly contributing to advances in agriculture . 
 
 = = District attorney and diplo[MASK]at = = [MASK] 
 In 1789 President George Washington appointed Gore the first United St[MASK]tes Attorney for Massachusetts as a reward for [MASK]is support . Gore controversially refused to resign from[MASK]the state [MASK]egislature , arguing that th[MASK] state constitution 's prohibitions against holding multiple offices did not apply to federal posts . He eventually resigned the legisl[MASK]tive[MASK]seat under protest because of [MASK]ressure from his fellow legisl[MASK]tors . 
 Gore served as di[MASK]trict attorney until 1796 . His principal matter of concern was the enforcement of U.S. neutrality with respect to the French Revolutionary Wars . He attempted several[MASK]times to prosecute the Frenc[MASK] consul in Boston , Antoine Dupl[MASK]ine , fo[MASK] arming and operating privateer[MASK] out of the Port of Boston , but he was stym[MASK]ed by local juries that sympathized with the French . Duplaine was eventual[MASK]y expelled on orders from Pre[MASK]ident George Washington based on evidence provided by Gore . 
 [MASK]ore also promoted anti @-@ French sentiment with political writings in Massachusetts newspapers . Writing under the pseudonym " Manlius " , he denounced t[MASK]e format[MASK]on of " Democratic Societies " for[MASK]ed to oppose Fede[MASK]alist policy and support pro @-@ French po[MASK]itions . He suggested to President Washington that someone be sent to England to negotiate with th[MASK] British . John Jay traveled to London in 1794 and [MASK]egotiated the Jay Treaty , whose ratification[MASK]Gore vocally supported . Although Gore was hostile to [MASK]rench policy , he was on friend[MASK]y terms with individual Frenchmen : he hosted the future French statesman Talleyrand when he visited the U.S. 
 In 1796 Washington app[MASK]inted[MASK]him as a commissioner representing the United States to handle maritime claims under the terms [MASK]he Jay Treaty . As a result the Gores moved to England th[MASK]t year , establishing a residence in the fa[MASK]hionable Hyde Par[MASK] [MASK]rea . The commission was established to arbitrate claims emanating from British seiz[MASK]res of American vess[MASK]ls[MASK]and cargoes , and from[MASK]British claims relating to violations of A[MASK]erican neutrality in the ongo[MASK]ng French R[MASK]volutionary Wars . It consisted of three Americans ( Gore , William Pinkney , and John [MASK]rumbull ) and two British commissioners ( J[MASK]hn Nicoll a[MASK]d Nicholas Astley ) ; Trumbull[MASK]was chosen by the other four because he was deemed to sufficiently " fair @-@ minded " to cast deciding votes in the event of disagreements . That year he was [MASK]lso elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences . 
 Although Gore was well recei[MASK]ed by the British establishment , the work suffered from what Gore called a " tediousness of pro[MASK]ess " , and he consi[MASK]er[MASK]d requesting a transfer in 1798 . In [MASK]800 it ground t[MASK] a halt be[MASK]ause another board establis[MASK]ed by the treaty to resolve outstanding Revolutionary War claim[MASK] against the United States had [MASK]ot yet met , and the Britis[MASK] stopped the claims proc[MASK]ssing until resolution of the other issues got underway . Gore used this break to briefly return to America and assess t[MASK]e [MASK]onditio[MASK] of his Waltham estate , where the house had been larg[MASK]ly destroy[MASK]d by fire in 1799 . After his return to London , with the commissio[MASK] work still stopped , he and Rebecca embarked on a tou[MASK] of Europe . They visited Holland , Belgium ,[MASK]and S[MASK]itzerland , a[MASK]d spent six months in Paris . During this trip , and later ones in England and Scotland , they took note of the architecture of country estates , an[MASK] began planning a new house[MASK]f[MASK]r their Wal[MASK]ham property . 
 The comm[MASK]ssion resumed its work in early 1802 [MASK] and [MASK]ad resolved [MASK]ll outstanding claims by August 1803 . It awarded $ 110 @,@ 000 to British clai[MASK]ants and over $ 6 million to American claimants . The lopsided result is due to the vastly larger number of American claims , but also to some key ear[MASK]y decisions that favored American interpretations in the processing of the claims , and by a British administration that sought to remain in America 's good gr[MASK]ces . 
 The Gore 's social circle in England revolved around his good friend Rufus King , who was appointed Ambassador to [MASK]reat [MASK]ritain in 1796 , along with other Massachusetts expatriates [MASK] Wh[MASK]n King left his pos[MASK] in May 1803 he named Gore to head the London embassy as chargé d 'affaires . Although President Thomas Jefferson never issued a formal appointm[MASK]nt , the British government a[MASK]cepted his role f[MASK]r the two @-@ month interval between King 's dep[MASK]rture and the arrival of James Monroe as King 's replacement . The Gores sailed for Boston in the sp[MASK]ing of 1804 . 
 Rebecca Gore used thei[MASK] exposure to European country estates[MASK]to design a lavish new building for their [MASK]altham estate during their English sojourn . Designed with t[MASK]e assistance of French architect [MASK]oseph @-@ Guillaume Legrand and probabl[MASK] [MASK][MASK]so influenced by the works of English a[MASK]chitect Sir J[MASK]hn Soane , the house that was bui[MASK]t upon their return to the United States in 1804 ( now known as Gore Place ) [MASK]s one of the finest extant examples of Federalist architecture .

 Soon a[MASK]ter his return to the United States , Gore reentered state politics , w[MASK]nnin[MASK] election to the Massachusetts Senate . He was ac[MASK]ive in the state Federalist Party organization , sitting on its secre[MASK] central commi[MASK]tee . He [MASK]esumed his l[MASK]w practice , in which he took on as a student Daniel Webster . One of the highest profile cases he took on was the 1807 defense of Thomas Selfridge , accused of murder[MASK]ng Charles Austin . Sel[MASK]ridge , an older Federalist attorney , had been retained to assist in the collection of a debt from Austin 's Republican f[MASK]ther . In the politically charged atmosphere of th[MASK] day in Boston , Selfri[MASK]ge , fearing for his own safety , had armed hims[MASK]lf with a dueling pistol . The younger Austin had , apparently on his own initiative , sought to be[MASK]t Selfrid[MASK]e with a cane , and Selfridge[MASK]fatally shot him in the encounter . Selfridge was prosecuted by A[MASK]torney General ( and future Gore gubernatorial opponent ) James Sullivan , and [MASK]he defense also inc[MASK]uded[MASK]a[MASK]ch @-@ Federalist Harrison Gray Otis . Gore argued Selfridge acted in self @-@ defense[MASK]; Selfridge was acquitted of murder by a jury whose foreman was Patriot an[MASK] Federalist Paul Revere after fifteen minutes ' deliberation . 
 Gore also resumed business activities upon his return . He invested in[MASK]a wide vari[MASK]ty of businesses and infrastructure , spurring economic activity in the state . His investments ranged widely , including maritime insurance ( wher[MASK] is father @-@ in @-@ law had made his fortune ) , bridges , locks , canals , and textiles . He was a major investor in the Middlesex Canal , the Craigie Bridge ( th[MASK] first to connect Boston to Cambridge ) , and the Boston Manufacturing Company , whose factory proving the single @-@ site production of textiles was in Waltham [MASK]ear his estate . Not al[MASK] of his ventures panned out : the canal was in the long run a fina[MASK]cial failure , as were efforts with other collaborators to develop Lechmere Point , the Cambridge side o[MASK] the Cr[MASK]igie Bridge . The textile mill , [MASK]owever , was a success , and Gore invested in the[MASK]Merrimack Manufacturing Company . When it decided to loca[MASK]e [MASK]n what is now Lowell , Mas[MASK]achusetts , Gore purchased shares in the Proprietors of Locks[MASK]and Canals , which o[MASK]erated ( and still owns today ) the Lowell canals . 
 In 1806 Gore won election to the [MASK]tate Senate . That year the Republicans were in th[MASK] majority , and the election for governor was close enough to require a [MASK]eco[MASK]nt . The legislature scrutinized the ballots in a[MASK]partisan manner ( for example , retai[MASK]ing ballots containing misspelled v[MASK]rs[MASK]ons of Repu[MASK]lican James Sullivan 's name and discardi[MASK]g similar ballots marked for Federalist Caleb St[MASK]ong ) . Gore and other Federalists raised a public outcry , and the legislature relented , eventually certify[MASK][MASK]g Strong as the winner . 
 Gore ran unsuccessfully for Governor of Massachusetts in 1807 and 1808 against a rising tide [MASK]f R[MASK]publicanism i[MASK] the state ,[MASK]losing both times to moderate Republican James Sullivan . The Federalists gained control of the state legislature in 1808 in a backlash against Republican economic polici[MASK]s , but Gore was criticized for his failur[MASK] to aggressivel[MASK] support stat[MASK] protests against the Embargo Act of 1807[MASK], which had a major negative effect on the state 's large merchant fleet . Gore was in 1808 elected to the Massachusetts House of Representatives , where he successfully led Federalist efforts to ensure the selection of a Fe[MASK]eralist slate of presidential electors . He also spearheaded [MASK]ctions to drive Senator John Quincy Adams from the Federalist Party over his support of Thomas Jefferson 's forei[MASK]n policy . The legislature elected Adams ' successor nine [MASK]onths early , and gave Adams suff[MASK]ciently distasteful instruct[MASK]ons[MASK]that he resigned the post and joined with the Republicans . 
 
 = = Governor = = 
 
 Gore led the Federalists to victory in 1809 against Sullivan 's successor , Levi Lincoln , Sr. , who had ta[MASK]en over as acti[MASK]g governor upon Sullivan 's de[MASK]th late in 1808 . During Gore 's term the prin[MASK]ipal domestic issue occupying state politics was a ba[MASK]kin[MASK] crisis s[MASK]imulated b[MASK] the federal policy of emb[MASK]rgoing trade with Great Brit[MASK]in and France , then embroile[MASK] in the Na[MASK]oleonic Wars . Although the cr[MASK]sis caused a number of bank failures in New England , Massachusetts banks largely escaped unscathed . 
 Foreign poli[MASK]y played a major[MASK]role in Gore 's administration . The legislature passed re[MASK]olves opposing the federal government 's hardline policy against trade and diplomatic relations with the United Kingdom ( the[MASK] embroiled in the[MASK][MASK]apoleonic Wars ) , a[MASK]d Gore in early 1810 invite[MASK] Francis Ja[MASK]es [MASK]ackson , who had been rejected as the UK 's ambassador to the US , to visit the state . This pressure may have played a role in[MASK]Pre[MASK]ident James Madison 's decision to renew relations with the UK and accept Jackso[MASK] [MASK]s crede[MASK]tials . 
 [MASK]he lessening of the war threat , and the choice by the Republicans of the[MASK]popular Elbridge Gerry as their candi[MASK][MASK]t[MASK] brought a cha[MASK]lenge to Federalis[MASK] control of Massachusetts in the 1810 elec[MASK]ions . The unostentatious Gerry and Republi[MASK]an partisans criticiz[MASK]d Gore for his [MASK]avish lifestyle , including his palatial Waltham residence and pompous activities [MASK]e organiz[MASK]d as governor , and highlighted his Loyalist family connections while emphasizing Gerry 's unimpeachab[MASK]e patriotism . Gerry won the election . Jackson did visit Boston , but he was greeted not by Gore[MASK], but Ge[MASK]ry . Gore r[MASK]n against Gerry again in[MASK]1811 , but lost in another acrimonious campaign . 
 Gore was granted an honorary law degree from Harvard in 1809 . He served on the college 's Board of Overseers from 1810 to 1815[MASK]and as a Fellow from 1816 to 1820 . Harvard 's first library building , a Gothic structure built in 1838 of Quinc[MASK] granite , was named in his honor , but was demolished when Wid[MASK]ner Librar[MASK] was built in its place in 1915 . ( This st[MASK]ucture is found on the seal of the city of [MASK]ambridge . ) One of the residential Winthrop House 's buildings is called Gore Hall in his honor .

 In the spring of 1813 , he was appointed [MASK]y[MASK]Governor Caleb Stro[MASK]g to fill the U[MASK]S. Senate seat vacated by the resignation of Senator James Lloyd[MASK].

 Gore remained active in the administration of Harvard , and was[MASK]active in a number of organizations , including the American A[MASK]ademy of Arts and Sciences [MASK]nd the Massachusetts Hist[MASK]r[MASK]cal S[MASK]ciety ( whose president he was from 1806 to 1818 ) . He was also ele[MASK]ted a member of the American Antiqua[MASK]ian Society in 1814 .[MASK]Gore spent most of his later years at his country estate in Waltham , s[MASK]ffering from w[MASK]rsening rheumatoid arthritis that made walking increasingly difficult . His declining health and lack of social scene in Waltham led him in 1822 to ret[MASK]rn to Boston in the winters . H[MASK] died on March 1 , 1827 in Boston and is buried in its Granary Burying Ground . 
 Gore 's wife died in 18[MASK]4 ; the couple had no children . The major beneficiary of the Gore estate was Harvard ( which received an estima[MASK]ed $ 100 @,@ 000 ) , a[MASK]though bequests were also made to the Am[MASK]rican Academy o[MASK] Arts and Scie[MASK]ces and the Massachuse[MASK]ts Historical Society .

It was decl[MASK]red a National Historic Landmark in 1970 . 
 
 
 = Nero = 
 
 Nero ( / ˈnɪəroʊ / ; Latin : Nerō Claudius Caesar Augustus Germanicus ; 15 December 37 AD – 9 June 68 AD ) was Roman Emperor from 54 to 68 , and the last in the Julio @-@ Claudian dynasty . Nero was adopted by his grand @-@ uncle Claudius to become his he[MASK]r and successor , and succeeded to the t[MASK]rone in 54 following Claudius ' death . 
 Nero focused much of his attention on diplomacy , trade and enhancing the cultural life [MASK]f the empire , but according to the historian Tacitus he[MASK]was viewed by the Roman p[MASK]ople as compulsiv[MASK] and corrupt . He ordered theatres built and promoted athl[MASK]tic games [MASK][MASK]During his reign , the redoubtable general Corbulo conducted a successful war a[MASK]d negotiated peace with the Parthian Empir[MASK] . His general Suetonius Paulinus crushed a revolt in Britain [MASK] Nero annexe[MASK] the Bospo[MASK]an Kingdom to the empire and began th[MASK] First Jewish – Roman War . 
 In 64 AD , most of Rome was de[MASK]troyed[MASK]in the Great Fire of Rome , which many Romans believe[MASK] Nero himself had started in order to clear land for his planned palatial complex , the Domus Aurea . In 68 , the rebellion of Vindex in Gaul and later the acclamation of Galba in Hispania drove Nero from the thron[MASK] . Facing a false report of being denounced [MASK]s a public enemy who was to be executed , he committed suicide on 9 June 68 ( the first Roman [MASK]mperor to do so ) . His death ended the Julio @-@ Claudian dynasty , sparking a brief period of civil wars known as[MASK]the Year of the Four Emperors . Nero 's rule is often associated with tyranny and extravagance . He is kn[MASK]wn f[MASK]r many executions , incl[MASK]ding that of his mother , and the [MASK][MASK]obable murd[MASK]r by poison of his step[MASK]ro[MASK]her Britannicus . 
 Nero was rumored to have had captured Christians dipped in oil and set on f[MASK]re in his garden at night as a source of light[MASK]. This view is ba[MASK]ed on the writings of Tacitus , Suetonius and Cassius Dio , the main surviving sources for Nero 's reign , but a[MASK]few surviving sources paint Nero in[MASK]a mo[MASK]e favourable light . Some sources , including some mentioned above , portray him as an emperor who was popular with the common Roman people , espe[MASK]ially in the East . Some modern historians question t[MASK]e reliability of[MASK]ancient sources when reporting on Nero 's tyrannical acts .

 Lucius Domitius Ahenobarbus , Nero , was born on 15 December 37 in Antium ( modern Anzio and Nettuno ) , near Rome . He was the only s[MASK]n of Gnaeus Domitius Ahenobarbus and Agrippina the Younger , sister of Emperor Caligula . 
 Nero 's father , Gnaeus , [MASK]as the[MASK][MASK]on of Lucius Domitius Ahenobarbus ( consul 16 BC ) and Antonia Major . Gnaeus w[MASK]s thus the grandson of Gnaeus Domitius Ahenobarbus ( consul 32 BC ) and probably Aemilia [MASK]epida on hi[MASK] father 's side , and the grandson of Mark Antony and Octavia Min[MASK]r on his mother 's s[MASK]de . Thus , Nero had [MASK]s his paternal grandmother Anton[MASK][MASK] Major , and also claim[MASK]d more remote descent from Antonia Minor[MASK][MASK]s a great @-@ grandson — later grandson after Claudius adopted[MASK]hi[MASK] . 
 Through Octavia , Nero was the great @-@ nephew of Caesar Augustus . Nero 's father [MASK]ad been employed as a praetor and was a membe[MASK] of Caligu[MASK]a 's staff when the latter travelled to the East ( some apparently think Suetonius refers to Augustus 's adopted son Gaius Caesar here , but this[MASK]is not likely ) . 
 Nero 's father was described by Suetonius as a murderer and a cheat who was charged by Emperor Tiberius with treason , adultery and incest . Tiberius died , allowing him to escape these[MASK]charges . Nero 's father died of edema ( " dropsy " ) in 39 when Nero was two . 
 Nero 's mother was Agrip[MASK]ina the Younger , a great @-@ granddaughter of Caesar Augustus and his wife Scribonia throu[MASK]h [MASK]heir daughter Julia the Elder and her husban[MASK] Marcus Vipsanius Agrippa . Agrippina 's father , Germanicus , was a grandson of Aug[MASK]stus 's wife , Livia , on one side and to Mark Antony and Octavia on the other . Germanicus ' mother Antonia Minor , was a daughter of Octavia Minor and Mark Antony . Octavia was Augustus ' elder s[MASK]ster . Germanicus was als[MASK] the adopted son of Tiber[MASK]us . Agrippina[MASK]poisoned her second husband Passienu[MASK] Crispus , so many anc[MASK]ent historians also accu[MASK]e her of murdering her thir[MASK] husband , the emperor Claudius .

 Nero[MASK]was no[MASK] expected to become Emperor because his maternal uncle , Caligula , had begun his reign at the age of 24 with enough time[MASK]to produce his own heir . Nero 's mother , Agrippina , lost favour with Caligula[MASK]and was exiled in 39 after her husband 's [MASK]eath . Caligula seized Nero 's inheritance and [MASK]ent him to be b[MASK]ought up by his less wealthy [MASK]unt , Domitia Lepida , who was the mother of Valeria Messalina , Claudius 's third wife . Caligula , his wife Caesonia and their infant daug[MASK]ter Jul[MASK]a Drusilla were murdered on 24 January 41 . These events led Claudius [MASK] Caligula 's uncle , to become emperor . Claudius allowed Agrippina to return from exile . 
 Cla[MASK]dius had married twice[MASK]before marrying Valeria Messalina . His previous marriages produced three children including a son , Drusus , who d[MASK]ed at a young age . He had two children[MASK]with Messalina – Claudia Octavia ( born 40 ) and Britannicus[MASK]( born 41 ) . Messalina was executed by Claudius in[MASK]the year 48 . 
 In 49 AD , Claudius married a fourth time , to Nero 's mother Agrippina , despite her being his niece [MASK] To aid Claudi[MASK]s politically , young Nero was adopted in 50 and took the n[MASK]me Nero Claudius Caesar Drusus Germanicus ( see adoption in R[MASK]me ) . Nero was older than his stepbrother[MASK]Britannicus , a[MASK]d thus became heir to the throne . 
 Nero was proclaimed an adult i[MASK] 51 at the age of 14 . He was appointed proconsul , e[MASK]tered and first addresse[MASK] the Senate , made joint public appearances with Claudius , and was featured in c[MASK]inage . In 53 , he married his stepsister Claudia Octavia .

 [MASK] Claudius died in 54 and Nero , taking the name Nero Claudius Caesar Augustus Germanicus , was established[MASK]as Emperor . [MASK]hough accounts vary , many ancient[MASK]historians st[MASK]te Agrippina poisoned Claudius . According to Pliny the Elder , she used poison mushrooms . It is not known how much Nero knew or if he was even involved in the death of [MASK]la[MASK]dius . 
 Suetonius wrote " ... for even if he was not the [MASK]nstigator of the emperor 's death , he[MASK]was at least privy to it , as he openly admitted ; for he used afterwards to laud mushrooms , the vehicle in whi[MASK]h the poison was admini[MASK]tered to Claudius , as " th[MASK] food of the gods , " as the Greek proverb has it . At any [MASK]ate , after Claudius ' death he [MASK]ented on him every kind of insult , in act a[MASK]d w[MASK]rd[MASK], charging him now with folly and now with cruelty ; for it was a favourite joke of his to say t[MASK]at Claudius had ceased " to play the fool " among morta[MASK]s , lengthening the firs[MASK] syllable of the word mo[MASK]ari , and he disregarded many of his decrees and acts as the work of a madman and a dotard . Finally , he neglected to enclose the place wher[MASK] his b[MASK]dy w[MASK]s burned except with a low and mean wall . " 
[MASK]Accord[MASK]ng to Suetonius ; Nero became Emperor at [MASK]h[MASK] age of 17 when the news o[MASK] Claudius ' death was made known , making him the youngest[MASK]emperor at that time Although , what Suetonius ma[MASK] have meant[MASK]is that he was in his sevent[MASK]enth year as his date of birth , also listed by Suetonius , would have made him 16 at the time of Claudius ' death . Tacitu[MASK] , in book XIII of[MASK]his Annals , describes Nero[MASK]as being ' scarcely out of his boyhood ' at the time he became emperor . Ancient historians describe Nero 's early reign as being strongly influenced by his mother , A[MASK]rippina , his tutor Lucius Annaeus Seneca , and t[MASK]e Praetorian Pr[MASK]fect Sextus Afranius Burrus , especially in the first year . Other tutors were less often mentioned , such as Alexander of Aegae . 
 Very ear[MASK]y in Nero 's rule , problems arose from competition for influence between Agrippina and Nero 's two main advisers , Seneca and Burrus . Agrippina also attempted to influence the young Nero . Agrippina also is mentioned by ancient sources as " scheming for her son ( Ne[MASK]o ) " . [MASK]his scheming continued as is evidenced by the coin of the both of them .[MASK]It is extremely unusual to see a women 's face on a coin in the ancient world [MASK] It is because [MASK][MASK] this position of power Agrippina fe[MASK]t jealous as Sen[MASK]ca in particular rose up in Nero 's court as he offered the advice Nero wanted to hear unlike his mother . 
 In 54 , Agrippina tried to sit down next to Nero while[MASK]he met with an Armenian envoy , but Se[MASK]eca stopped her and prevented a scandalous scen[MASK] ( as it wa[MASK] unimaginable at that time for a wo[MASK]an to be in the same room as men doing official business ) . Nero 's fri[MASK][MASK]ds also mistrusted Agrippina and told Nero to bewa[MASK]e of his mother . 
 Nero was reportedly unsatisfied[MASK]with his marriage to Octavia and entered into an affair with Claudia Acte , a former slave . In 55 , Agrippina attempted to intervene in favo[MASK] of Octavia and demanded[MASK]that her [MASK]on dismiss Acte . Nero , with the support of Seneca , resisted the interventi[MASK]n of his mother in his personal affairs . 
 [MASK][MASK]t[MASK] Agrippi[MASK]a[MASK]'s influence over her son severed[MASK], she reportedly [MASK]egan pushing for Britannicus , Nero 's stepbrother , to become emperor . Nearly fourteen @-@ year @-@ old Britanni[MASK]us , heir @-@ d[MASK]signate prior to Nero 's adoption , [MASK]as still legally a mi[MASK]or , bu[MASK] wa[MASK] approach[MASK]ng legal adulthood . According to Tacitus , Agrippina hoped that with her support , Britannicus , being the blood son of Claudius , would be seen as the true heir to the throne by the st[MASK]te over Nero . However , the youth died suddenly and suspic[MASK]ously on 12 Febru[MASK]ry 55 , the very day before h[MASK]s proclamation as an adult had been set . 
 Nero claimed th[MASK]t Britanni[MASK]us died from an epileptic seizure , [MASK]ut ancient historians all claim Britannicus ' death came from Nero 's poisoning him . Supposedly , he enlisted the se[MASK]vices of Locusta , [MASK] woman who [MASK]pecialized in the manufacture of poisons . She [MASK]evised a mixture to kill Britannicus , but after testing it unsuccessfull[MASK] on a slave , Nero angrily threatened to have her put to death if she did not come up with s[MASK]mething usable . Locusta then devised a new concoction that she promised would " kill swifter than a viper . " 
 Her promise was fulfilled after Britannicus consumed it at a dinner party from water used to cool his wine , which had already been tasted , and succumbed with[MASK]n minutes [MASK] After the death of Bri[MASK]annicu[MASK] , Agrippina was accused of slandering Octavia and Nero ordered her out of the imperial residence . 
 
 = = = Matricide and consolidation of power = = = 
 
 Over time , Nero became progre[MASK]sively more powerful , fre[MASK]ing himself of his advisers and eliminating rivals to the throne . In 55 , he removed Marcu[MASK] Antonius Palla[MASK][MASK], an ally of[MASK]Agrippina[MASK], from his position in the treasury . Pall[MASK]s [MASK] along[MASK]with Burrus , was accus[MASK]d of conspiring against the Emperor to bring Faustus Sulla to [MASK]he throne . Seneca was accused of having relations with Agrippina and embez[MASK]lement . Sene[MASK]a succeeded in having himself , Pallas and Burrus acquitted . According to Cassius Dio [MASK] at this time , Seneca and[MASK]Burrus reduced their role in governing from careful management to mere moderation of Nero[MASK]. 
 In 58 , Nero became romantically involved with Poppaea Sabina , th[MASK] w[MASK]fe of his friend and future emperor Otho . R[MASK]ported[MASK]y because a marriage to Poppaea and a divorce from Octavia did not seem [MASK]olitically feasible with Agrippina alive , Nero ordered the murder of his mother in 59 . A number of modern historians fin[MASK] t[MASK]is an unlikely motive as Nero did n[MASK]t marry Pop[MASK]aea until 62 . 
 Additionally , a[MASK]cording to Suetonius , Poppaea did[MASK]n[MASK]t divorce her husband until aft[MASK]r Agrippina 's death , making it unlikely that the already married Poppaea would be pressing Nero for marriage . Some modern historians theorize that Nero 's execution of Agrippina was prompted by her plotting to set Rubellius Plautus on the throne . According to Suetonius , Nero tried to kill his mother through a shipwreck plann[MASK]d by his freedman[MASK]tutor Anicetus . Instead , it took the life of Agrippina 's friend , Acerronia Polla[MASK]. When Agrippina survived , he had her executed by Anicetus[MASK]and framed it as a suicide . The incident is[MASK]also recorded by Tacitus . 
 In 62 , Nero 's adviser , Burrus , died . Additionally , Seneca was again faced with embezzlement charges . Seneca asked Nero for permission to retire fro[MASK] [MASK]ublic affairs . Nero divorced and banished Octavia on grounds of infertility , leaving him free to marry the pregnant Poppaea . After public protests , Nero was forced to allow Octavia to return from exile , but she was executed shortly after her return . 
 Nero also was repor[MASK]ed to have kicked Po[MASK]paea to dea[MASK]h in 65 before she[MASK]could have his second child . However , modern historians , noting Suetonius , Tacitus and Cassius Dio 's possible bias against Ne[MASK]o and the likelihood that they did not have eyewitness accoun[MASK]s of private events , [MASK]ostulate that Poppaea m[MASK]y have died because of complication[MASK] of miscarriage o[MASK] childbirth . 
 Accusations of treason bei[MASK]g plotted against Nero and the Senate first a[MASK]peared in 62 . The Senate ruled that Antistius , a praetor , should be put to death for speaking ill of Nero at a party . Later , Nero ordered the exile of Fabri[MASK]ius Veiento who slandered the [MASK]enate in a book . Tacitus writes that the roots of the conspiracy led[MASK]by Ga[MASK]us Calpurnius Piso began in this year . T[MASK] consolidate power ,[MASK]Nero executed a number of peopl[MASK] in 62 and 63 including [MASK]is rivals Pallas , Rubellius Plautus and Faustus Sulla . According to Suetonius , Nero " showed ne[MASK]ther discrimination nor moderation in [MASK]ut[MASK]ing to death whomsoever he pleased " during this period . 
 Nero 's consolidation of power al[MASK]o included [MASK] slow usurping of authority from[MASK]the Senate . In 54 , Nero promised to give the Senate powers equivalent to those under Republican rule . By 65 , senators complained that they had no power left and this led to the [MASK]isonian conspiracy .

 When Nero 's wife Poppaea Sabina died in 65 , Nero went into deep mour[MASK]ing[MASK]. Her body was not cremated , it was stuffed wi[MASK]h spices , embalmed and put in the Mausoleum of[MASK]Augu[MASK]tus . Sh[MASK] was given a state funeral . Nero p[MASK]aised her during the funeral eulogy and gave her divine honors . It is said that Nero " burned ten years ' worth of Arabia 's incen[MASK]e production at her funeral . 
 In the beginning of 66 , he married Statilia Messalina . She was alr[MASK]ady married when she became Nero 's mistress in 65 AD , with [MASK]tatilia [MASK]s husband bein[MASK] driven to suicide in 66 , so Nero could marry Statilia . She was one of the few of Nero 's courtiers who survived the fall of his reign . 
 In 67 , Nero ordered a young freedman , Sporus , to be castrated and then marr[MASK]ed him . According to Dion Cassius , Sporus bore an uncanny resemblance to Sabina , and Nero even called him by his dead wife 's name .

 Over the c[MASK]urse of his reign , Nero often made rulings that pleased the lower class . Ner[MASK] was criticized as being obsessed with pers[MASK]nal popul[MASK]rity . 
 Nero began his reign in 54 by promising the Senate more autonomy . In[MASK]this[MASK]first[MASK]y[MASK]ar , he forbade others to refer to him with regard to enactments , for which he was praised by the Senate [MASK] Nero was kn[MASK]wn for spending his time visiting brothels a[MASK]d taverns during this period . 
 In 55 , Nero began taking on a more active role as an administrator . He was consul [MASK]our times b[MASK]tween 55 and 60 . During this period , some ancient historians speak fairly well of Nero and contrast it with his later rule .[MASK]
 Under [MASK]ero , restrictions were put[MASK]on the amount of bail and fines . Also , fees for lawyers were limited . There was a discu[MASK]sion in the Senate on the misconduct of the[MASK]freedmen class , and a stro[MASK]g demand was made that pa[MASK]rons should have the right of revoking freedom . Nero supported the freedme[MASK] and ruled that patrons had no such right . 
 The Senat[MASK] tried to pass a law in which the crimes of one slave applied to all slaves within a household . Despite [MASK]iots from the people , Ner[MASK] supported the Senate on th[MASK]ir measure , and deplo[MASK]ed troops to organise the execution of 400 slaves affected by the law . However , he vetoed strong measures against the freedmen affected by the case . 
 After tax collectors were accus[MASK]d of being to[MASK] harsh to the poor , Nero transferred[MASK]collecti[MASK]n auth[MASK]rity to lower commissioners . Nero banned any[MASK]magistrate or procurator from exhibiting public ente[MASK]tainment for fear that the venue was being used as a method to [MASK]way the populace . Add[MASK]tionally , there were many impeachments and removals of government offici[MASK]ls along with arrests for extortion and corruption . 
[MASK]Wh[MASK]n further complaint[MASK] a[MASK]ose that the poor were being overly taxed , Nero attempted to repeal all in[MASK]ire[MASK]t taxes . The Senate convin[MASK]e[MASK] him this action would bankrupt th[MASK] public treasury . As a compromis[MASK] , taxes were[MASK]cut from 4 @.@ 5 % to 2 @.@ 5 % . Additionally , secret government tax records were ordered to become public . [MASK]o lo[MASK]er the cost of food imports , merchant[MASK]ships were declared tax @-@ exempt . 
[MASK]In imitation of the Greeks , Nero built a number of gymnasiums and theatres . Enorm[MASK]us gladiatorial shows were also held . Nero also established the quinquennial Neronia . The festival included games , poetry , and t[MASK]eater . Historians indicate that there was a belief that theatre led to[MASK]immorality . Others considered that to have performers dressed[MASK]in Greek clothi[MASK]g was old fashioned . Some questione[MASK] the large public expenditure on entertainment . 
 In 64 ,[MASK]Rome burned . Nero enacted a public relief effort as well as significant reconstruction . A num[MASK]er of other majo[MASK] constructi[MASK]n projects occurred in Nero 's late reign . Nero had the[MASK]marshes of Ostia filled with rubble from the fire . He erected the large Domus Aurea [MASK] In 67 , Nero attempted to hav[MASK] a canal dug at the Is[MASK]hmus of Corinth . Ancient historians state that these projects and other[MASK] exacerbated the drain on the State 's budget . 
[MASK]The cost to rebuild R[MASK]m[MASK] was [MASK]mm[MASK]nse , requiring funds the state treasury did not have . N[MASK]ro devalued the Roma[MASK] cu[MASK]rency fo[MASK] th[MASK] first time in the Empire 's history . He reduced the weight of th[MASK] denarius from 84 per Roman pound to 96 ( 3 @.@ 85 grams to 3 @.@ 35 g[MASK]ams ) . He also re[MASK]uced the silver purity from 99 @.@ 5 % to 93 @.@ 5 % — the silver weight dropping from 3 @.@ 83 grams to 3 @.@ 4 [MASK]rams . Furthermore , Nero reduced the weight of the aureus from 40 per[MASK]Roman pound to 45 ( 8 grams to 7 @.[MASK] 2 gr[MASK]ms ) . 
 [MASK]etween 62 and 67 , according to Plinius the Elder and Seneca , Nero promoted an [MASK]xpedition to discover the sources of the Nile R[MASK]ver . It was the first explor[MASK]tion of equatorial Africa f[MASK]om Europe in history . However , [MASK]ero 's expedi[MASK]ion up the Nile fai[MASK]ed upon reachi[MASK]g the imp[MASK]netra[MASK]le Sudd of present @-@ day South Sudan . 
 The economic policy of[MASK]Ne[MASK]o is a point of debate among scho[MASK]ars . According to ancient historians , Nero 's construction projects were overly extravagant [MASK]nd th[MASK] large number [MASK]f expenditures und[MASK]r Nero left Italy " thoroughly exhausted by contributions of money " with " the provinces ruined . " Modern historians , thoug[MASK] , note tha[MASK] the period was riddled with deflation and that[MASK]it is likely that Nero [MASK]s spending came in the form of public works projects and charity intended to ease [MASK]conomic troubles .

 The Great Fire of Rome erupt[MASK][MASK] on [MASK]he night of 18 July to 19[MASK]July 64 . The [MASK]ire started at the s[MASK]utheastern en[MASK] of the Circus Maximus in shops selling flammable goods . 
 The extent of the fire is uncertain . According to T[MASK]citus , who was nine at the time of the fire , it spread quickly and b[MASK]rned for over five days . It destroyed three of fourteen Roman districts and severely damaged seven [MASK] The only othe[MASK] his[MASK]orian who lived through the perio[MASK] and mentio[MASK]ed the fi[MASK]e [MASK]s Pl[MASK]ny the Elder , who wrote about it in passing . Other historians who lived through the period ( including Josephus , Dio Chrysostom , Plutarch and Epictetus ) make no mention of it in what remains of their work . 
 It is uncertain who or what actually caused th[MASK] fire — whether accident or arson . Suetonius and Cassius Dio favor Nero as the arsonist , so he could build a palatial complex . Tacitus mentions that Christians co[MASK]fessed to the crime , but it is not known whether these confessio[MASK]s were induced by torture . However , accidental fires were common in ancient Rome . In fact , Rome suffered other large fires in 69 and in 80 . 
 It was said by Suetonius and Cass[MASK]us Dio that Nero sang the " Sack of[MASK]Ilium[MASK]" in stage costume while the city burned . Popular legend claims that Nero played the fiddle at the time of the fire , an anachro[MASK]ism[MASK]bas[MASK]d merely[MASK]on the concept of the lyre , a stringed instrument associated with Nero and his performances .[MASK]( The fiddle was not invented until the 10th century . ) Tacitus 's [MASK]ccount , however , has Nero in Antium at the time of t[MASK]e fire . Tacitus also s[MASK]id that Ne[MASK]o playing his[MASK]lyre and singing while [MASK]he city burned was only rumor . 
 According to Tacitus , upon hearing [MASK]ews of the fire , N[MASK]ro returned to Rome to organize a relief effort , wh[MASK]ch he pai[MASK] [MASK]or from his own funds . Nero 's [MASK]ontributions to th[MASK] relief extended to personally ta[MASK]ing part in the search for and rescue of victims of the blaze , s[MASK]ending days searching the debris w[MASK]tho[MASK]t even his [MASK]odyguards . After the fire , Nero opened his palaces to provide shelter for the homeless , and arranged for food supplies to be delivered in order to prevent starvation among the survivors . 
 In the wake [MASK]f the[MASK]fire , he made a new urban development plan . Houses after the fire were spaced out , built in brick[MASK], and faced by porticos on wide road[MASK] . Nero also built a new pa[MASK]ace com[MASK]le[MASK] known as the Domus Aur[MASK]a in an area cleared by the fire . This inc[MASK]uded lush artificial l[MASK]ndscapes and a 30 @-@ mete[MASK] @-@ tall statue of himself , the[MASK]Colossus of [MASK]ero . The size of this complex is debated ( from 100 to 300 acres ) . [MASK]o find the necessary funds for the reconstruction , tributes were imposed on the provinces of the empir[MASK] . 
 Tacitus , in[MASK]one of the earliest non @-@ Chris[MASK]ian references to the origins of Christianity , notes that the population searched for a scapegoat and rumors held Nero responsible . To de[MASK]lect blame , Nero target[MASK]d Christians . He ordered Chris[MASK]ians to [MASK]e thrown to dogs , while [MASK]thers were crucified and burned . 
 
 = = = Public performances = =[MASK]= 
 
 Nero enjoyed driving [MASK] one @-@ horse chariot , singing to the lyre and poetry . H[MASK] even composed songs that were performed by other entertainers throughout the empire . At first , Nero only performed for a private audience . 
 In 64 A[MASK] . , Nero began singing in public in Neapolis in order to improve his popularity . He[MASK]also sang at the second quinquenni[MASK]l Neronia in 65 . It was said that Nero craved the attention , but historia[MASK]s also write that Nero was enc[MASK]u[MASK]aged to sing and perform in public by the Senate , his inner circle and th[MASK] people . Ancient historians strongly [MASK]riticize his choice to perform , calling it s[MASK]ameful . 
 Nero was persuaded to participate in the Olympic G[MASK]mes of 67 in order to im[MASK]ro[MASK]e relations with Gr[MASK]ece and display Roman dominance . As a competitor , Nero raced a ten @-@ horse chariot and nearly died after being thrown[MASK]from it . He [MASK]lso performed as an actor and a singer . Th[MASK]ugh Nero f[MASK]ltered in his racing ( in one case , dropping out ent[MASK]rely before the end ) and acting competitions , he won these crowns nevertheless and paraded them whe[MASK] he returned to Rome . The victorie[MASK] are attributed to Nero bribing the judges and his status as emperor .

 [MASK] Shortly after Nero 's accession to the throne in 54 , [MASK]he Roman vassal kingdom of Armenia overthrew their Iberian pr[MASK]nce Rhadamistus[MASK]and h[MASK] was replaced with the Parthia[MASK] pri[MASK]ce T[MASK]ridates . This was seen as a Parthian invasion of Roman territory . There was concern [MASK]n Rome over how the young Emperor would handle the situation . Nero reacted by[MASK]immediatel[MASK] sending the m[MASK]litary to the region under the command of Gnaeus[MASK]Domitius Corbulo . The Parthians[MASK]temporarily relinquished control[MASK]of Armenia to Rome . 
[MASK]The peace did[MASK]not last and[MASK]full @-@ scale war broke out in 58 . The Parthian king Vologases I refused to remo[MASK]e[MASK]his brother Tiridates from[MASK]Armenia . The Parthians beg[MASK]n a [MASK]ull @-@ scale invasion of the Armenian kingd[MASK]m . Commander Corbulo responded and repelled most of t[MASK]e Parthian army that same year . Tiridates retreated and Rome again controlled most of Armenia . 
 Nero was acclaimed in public for this ini[MASK]ial vic[MASK]ory . Tigranes , a Cappadocian noble raised in Rome , was installed by Nero as the new ruler of Armeni[MASK] . Corbulo was appointed governor of Syria [MASK]s a re[MASK]ard . 
 In 62 , Tigranes invaded the Parthian prov[MASK]nce of Adiabene . Ag[MASK]in , Rome and Parthia wer[MASK] at war and this continued until 63 . Parthia began building up for a strike against the Roman province of Syria . Corb[MASK]lo tried to convince Nero [MASK]o continue the war , but Ner[MASK] opted for a peace deal instead . There was anxiety in Rome about eas[MASK]ern grain supplies and a budget deficit . 
 The result was a deal where Tiridates again became the[MASK]Armenian king , b[MASK]t wa[MASK] crowned in [MASK]ome by Emperor Nero . In the future , the king o[MASK] Armenia wa[MASK] to be a[MASK]Parthian prince , but his appointment required approval from the Romans . Tiridates was forced to come t[MASK] Rome and partake in ceremonies meant to display Roman dominance . 
 This peace deal of 63 was a considerable v[MASK]ctory for[MASK]Nero politica[MASK]ly . Nero beca[MASK]e very popular[MASK]in the eastern provinces of Rome and with the Parthians as well . The[MASK]peace between Parthia and Rome[MASK]lasted 50 years until Empero[MASK] Trajan o[MASK] Rome invaded Armenia in 114[MASK].

 The war with Parthia [MASK]as not Nero 's only major war but he was both criticized [MASK]nd praised for an aversion to battle . Like many emperors [MASK] Nero fac[MASK]d a number of rebellions and power [MASK]truggles within the empire . 
 British Revolt of 60 – 61 ( Boudi[MASK]a 's Uprising [MASK] 
 In 60 , a major rebellion [MASK]ro[MASK]e out in t[MASK]e province of Britannia[MASK]. While the governor Gaius Suetonius Paulinus and his troops were bu[MASK]y capturing the island of Mona ( Anglesey ) from the druids , the tribes of the southe[MASK]st staged a revolt led by queen Boudica of the Iceni . Boudica an[MASK] her troops destroyed three cities b[MASK]fore the army of Paulinus could return , receive r[MASK]inforcements , and quell the rebellion in[MASK]61 . Fearing [MASK]aulinus himself would provoke further rebellion , Nero replaced him with the more passive Publius Petronius Turpilianus . 
 The Pisonian Conspiracy of 65 
 In 65 , Gaius Calpurniu[MASK] Piso , a Roman statesman , organized a conspiracy against [MASK][MASK]ro with the help of Subrius Flavus a[MASK]d Sulpicius Asper , a tri[MASK]une and a centurion of the Praetorian Guard . According to Tacitus , m[MASK]ny co[MASK]spirators wished to " rescue[MASK]the state " from th[MASK] emperor and restore the R[MASK]public . [MASK]he freedma[MASK] M[MASK]lichus discovered the co[MASK]spiracy and reported it to Nero 's secretary , Epaphroditos . As a result , the conspiracy fail[MASK]d and its [MASK]embers were executed i[MASK]cluding Lucan[MASK], th[MASK] poet . Ne[MASK]o [MASK]s previous advisor , Seneca was ordered to commit suicide[MASK]after admitting he discussed the [MASK]lot with the conspirators . 
 The First Jewish War[MASK]of 66 – 70 
 In 66 , there was a Jewish[MASK]revolt in Jude[MASK] stemming from Greek and Jewish religious tens[MASK]on . In 67 , Nero dispatched Vespasian to resto[MASK]e order . This [MASK]evolt was eventually put down in 70 , after Nero 's death .

 = = = The revolt of Vindex and Galba and the death of Ner[MASK] = = = 
 
 In March 68 , Gaiu[MASK] Julius[MASK]Vindex , the governor of Gallia Lugdunensis , rebelled against Nero 's tax policies . Lucius Verginius Rufus , the governor of Germania Superi[MASK]r , wa[MASK] orde[MASK]ed t[MASK] put down Vindex 's rebellio[MASK] . In an attempt to gain support from outside his own province , Vindex called [MASK]pon Servius Sulpi[MASK]ius Galba , the governor of Hispania Tarraconensis , to join the rebellion and further , to declare himself emperor in opposition to Nero .[MASK]
 At the Battle of Vesontio in May 68 , Verginius ' forces easily defeated those of Vindex and the latter committed suicide . However , after putting down this one rebel , Verginius ' legions attempted to proclaim their ow[MASK] commander as Emperor . V[MASK]rginius refused to act against Nero , but the disconten[MASK] of the legions of Germany and the continued opposi[MASK]ion o[MASK] Galba in Spain did not bode well for him . 
 [MASK]hile Nero had retained some control of the situation , support for Galba increased despite his being officially declared a public enemy . The pre[MASK]ect o[MASK] the Praetorian Guard , Gaius Nymphidius Sabinus , also abandoned his allegiance to the Emperor and came out in support for Galba . 
 In response , Nero fled Rome with the int[MASK]ntion of going to the port of Ostia and , from there , to take a fleet to one of the still @-@ loyal eastern provinces . According[MASK]to Suetonius , Nero abandoned the i[MASK]ea when some army officers openly [MASK]e[MASK]used to obey his co[MASK]mands , responding with a line from Vergil 's Aeneid : " Is it so dreadful a thing then to die ? " Nero then toyed with the idea of fleeing to Parthia , thr[MASK]wing himself upon the mer[MASK]y of Galba , or to appeal to the people and beg them to pardon him for his past offences " and if he could not soften their hearts , to entreat them at least to allow hi[MASK] the prefecture of Egypt " . Suetonius reports that the te[MASK]t of this speech was later fo[MASK]nd in Nero 's writing desk , but that he dared not give it from fear of being torn t[MASK] pieces before he could reach the Forum . 
 Nero returned to Rome and spent the evening in the palace . After sleeping , he a[MASK]oke at about midnight to find the palace guard had left . Dispatching messages to his friends ' palace chambers for them to[MASK]come , he received no answers . Upon going to their chambers pe[MASK]sonally , he found them all abandon[MASK]d . When he ca[MASK]led for a gladiator or anyone else adept with a sword to kill him , no one appeared . He cried , " Have I neither friend n[MASK]r foe ? " and ran out as if to thr[MASK]w himself into the Tiber . 
 [MASK]eturning , Nero [MASK]ought for some plac[MASK] where he could hide and collect his thoughts . An imperial freedman , Phaon , offered his[MASK]villa , located 4 miles outside the city . Travelling in disguise , Nero and four loyal freedmen , Epaphroditos , Phaon , Neophytus ,[MASK]and Sporus , reached the villa , where Nero ordered them to di[MASK] a grave[MASK]for [MASK]im . 
 At this time , a courier arrived with a report tha[MASK] the S[MASK]nate had declared Nero a public enemy and that it was t[MASK]eir intention to execute [MASK]im by beating him to death and that armed men had been sent to apprehend him for the act to take place [MASK]n the Forum .[MASK]The Senate actually was still reluctant and deliberating on the right course [MASK]f action as Nero was the last [MASK]ember of the Julio @-@ Claudian Family[MASK]. Indeed , most of the senators had serve[MASK] the imperial family all their lives and felt a sense of loyalty to the deified bloodline , if not to Nero himself . The men actually had the goal of returning [MASK]ero back to the Senate , where the Senate hoped [MASK]o work out a compromise with th[MASK] rebel[MASK]ing gove[MASK]nors that would preserv[MASK] Nero 's life , so that at least a fut[MASK]re heir to the dynasty could be produced . 
 Nero , however , did not know t[MASK]is , and [MASK]t the news[MASK]brought by th[MASK] courier , he [MASK]repared himself for [MASK]uicide , pacing up and down muttering " Qu[MASK]lis art[MASK]fex pereo " which translates to English as " What an artist dies in m[MASK] . " Losing his nerve , he first begged for one of his companions to set an example by first killing himself[MASK]. At last , th[MASK] sound of approachi[MASK]g[MASK]horsemen drove Nero to face the end . However , he still could[MASK]not bring himself to take his own life but instead he forced his private secretary , Epaphroditos , to perform the task . 
[MASK]When one of the horsemen entered , upon [MASK]is[MASK]seeing Nero all but dead he attempted to stop the bleeding in vain . Nero 's final words were " Too late ! This is fidelity ! [MASK] H[MASK][MASK]died on 9 June 68 , the anniversary of the[MASK]death of Octavia , and was buried in the Mausoleum of the Domitii Ahenobarb[MASK] , in what is now the Vill[MASK] Borghese ( Pincian Hill ) area of Rome . 
 With his death , the Julio @-@ Claudian dynasty ende[MASK] . The S[MASK]nate , [MASK]hen news of his death reached Rome , posthumou[MASK][MASK]y declared Nero a public enemy to appease[MASK]the c[MASK]ming Galba ( as[MASK]the Sen[MASK]te had initially [MASK]eclared Galba as a pub[MASK]ic enemy ) and proclaimed Galba the new emperor . Chaos would ensue in the year of[MASK]the Four Emperors . 
 
 = = = Post mortem = = = 
 
 According to Suetonius and Cassius Dio , the people of Rome [MASK]elebrated the death of Nero . Tacitus , though , describes a more compli[MASK]ated political environment . [MASK]acitus mentions that Nero 's death was wel[MASK]omed by Senators , nobility and the u[MASK]per class . The lower @-@ class , slaves , frequente[MASK]s of the arena [MASK]nd the theater , and " those who were suppo[MASK]ted by the famous excesses of Nero " , [MASK]n the other hand , were upset [MASK]ith the news . Members of the military were said to have mixed feelings , as they had allegiance to Nero , but were bribed[MASK]to overthrow him . 
 Eastern sources , namely Philostrat[MASK]s II and Apol[MASK]onius of Tyana[MASK], mention that Nero 's [MASK]eath was mourned as he " restored the liberties of Hellas with a wisdom and moderation quite alien to h[MASK][MASK] character " and that he " held our liberties in his hand and respected them . " 
 Modern scholarship generally holds that , while the Senate and more well @-@ off indiv[MASK]duals welco[MASK]ed Nero 's death , the general populace was " loyal to the end a[MASK]d beyond , for Otho and Vitellius both thought it worthwhile to appeal to t[MASK][MASK]i[MASK] nostalgi[MASK] . " 
 Nero 's name was erased from some monument[MASK] , in what Edward Champlin regards as an " outburst of private zeal " . Many portraits of Ne[MASK]o were reworked to represent other[MASK]figures ; according to Eric R. Varner , over fifty such images survive[MASK]. This reworking of images is often explai[MASK]ed as part of the way in which t[MASK]e memory of disgraced emperors was condemned posthumously ( see damnatio memoriae ) [MASK] Champlin , however , doubts that the practice is neces[MASK]arily nega[MASK]ive and notes that some continued to create images of Nero long aft[MASK]r his death . 
 The civil war during the year of the Four Emp[MASK]rors [MASK]as described by ancient historia[MASK]s[MASK]as a troubling period . A[MASK]cording to Tacitus , this i[MASK]stability was rooted in the fact that emperors could no longer rely[MASK]on the[MASK]p[MASK]rceived legitimacy of the imperial bloodline , as Nero and those before hi[MASK] could . Gal[MASK]a began his short reign with the e[MASK]ecuti[MASK]n of many al[MASK][MASK]es of Nero and possible future enemies . One such notable enemy included Nymphidi[MASK]s Sabinus , who [MASK]laimed to be the son of[MASK]Emperor Caligula . 
 Otho overthrew Galba . Otho was said to be liked by many soldiers because he had been a friend of Nero 's and resembled him somewhat in temperament[MASK]. It[MASK]was said that the common Roman hailed Otho as Nero himself . Otho used " Nero " as a surname and reerected [MASK]an[MASK] statues to Nero . Vitellius overthrew Otho . Vitellius began his reign with a large[MASK]funeral for Nero complet[MASK] with songs written by Nero . 
 After[MASK]Nero 's suicide [MASK]n 68 , there was a widesp[MASK]ead belief , especially in the eastern provinces , tha[MASK] he was not dead and somehow would return . Th[MASK]s belief came to be known as the Nero Redivivus Legend . 
 The legend of Nero 's return lasted for hundreds of years after Nero 's death . Augustine of Hippo wrote of t[MASK]e legend as a popular belief in 422 . 
 At least thre[MASK] Nero imposters emerged leading rebellions . The fi[MASK]st , wh[MASK] sang and played [MASK]he cithara or lyre and whose [MASK]ace was similar to that of the dead emperor , appeared in 69 during the reign of V[MASK]tellius . After persuading some to recognize him , he was captured and executed . Sometim[MASK] during the reign of Titus ( 79 – 81 ) , another impostor appeared in Asia and[MASK]sang to the accompaniment[MASK]of the lyre and looked[MASK]like Nero but he , too , was kill[MASK]d . Twenty years after Nero 's death , during the re[MASK]gn of Domitian , there was a third pretender . He was supported by the [MASK]arthians , who only reluctantly gave him up , and the matter almost came to war .

 In his book The Lives of the Twelve Caesars [MASK] S[MASK]etonius descri[MASK]es Nero as " a[MASK][MASK]ut the average height , his body marked with spots and malodorous , his hair light blonde , his features regular rat[MASK]er [MASK]han attractive , his eyes blue and somewhat weak , his neck over thick , his belly prominent , and his legs very slender .

 = = Historiography = = 
 
 The history of Nero 's reign is problematic in that no historical sources survived that were contemporary with N[MASK]ro . These first hist[MASK]ries at one ti[MASK]e did exist and were described as b[MASK]ased and fantast[MASK]cal , either overly critical or pra[MASK]sing of Nero . The original sources were also said to cont[MASK]adict on a nu[MASK]ber of events . Nonetheless , these lost primary sources were the basis of surviving s[MASK]condary and te[MASK]tiary histories on Nero written by the next generations of historians . A few of the contemporary historians are known by name [MASK] Fabius Rusticus ,[MASK]Cluvius Rufus and Pliny the Elder all wrote condemning histories on Nero that a[MASK]e now lost . There wer[MASK] also pro @-@ Nero histories , but it is unknown who wrote them or for what deeds Nero was praised . 
 The bulk of[MASK]what is known of Nero comes from Tacitus , Suetonius and Cassius Dio , who were all of the sen[MASK][MASK]orial class . Tacitus and Suetonius wrote their histories on Nero over fifty years after his death , while Cassius Dio wrote his history over 15[MASK] years after Nero 's death . These sources contradict on a number of even[MASK]s in Nero 's life including the death of C[MASK]audius , the [MASK]eath of A[MASK]rippina , and the Roman fire o[MASK] 64 , [MASK]ut they a[MASK]e consistent in their condemnation of Nero . 
 A handful of other sources also add a limited and varying perspec[MASK]ive on Nero . Few[MASK]surviving sources paint Nero in a favourabl[MASK] light . Some sources , though , portray him as a competent emperor who was popular with the Roman people , especially in the e[MASK]st . 
 Cas[MASK]ius Dio 
 C[MASK]ssius Dio ( c . 155 – 229 ) was the son of Cassius Apronianus , a Roman senator . He passed the greater part of his life in public[MASK]service . He was a senator under Commodus and governor of Smyrna after the death of Septimius Severus ; and afterwards suffect consul around 205 , and a[MASK]so proconsul in Africa and Pannonia . 
 Books 61 – 63 of Dio 's Roman H[MASK]story describe the reign of[MASK]Nero . Only fra[MASK]ments of these books remain a[MASK]d what does remain was abridged and altered by John Xiphilinus , an 11th @-@ century monk . 
 Dio Chrysostom 
 Dio Chryso[MASK]tom ( c . 40 – 120 ) , a Greek phi[MASK]osopher and historian , wrote the Roman pe[MASK]ple were very happy with [MASK]ero and would have allowed him to rule indefinitely . They longed f[MASK]r h[MASK]s[MASK]rule on[MASK]e he was gone and em[MASK]raced imposters when they appeared : 
 Indeed the truth a[MASK]out this has not come out even y[MASK]t ; for so far as the rest[MASK]of his sub[MASK]ects were concerned , there was nothing to prevent his co[MASK]tinuing to [MASK]e Emperor for all time , seeing that eve[MASK] now everybody wish[MASK]s he were still alive . And the great majority do believe that he still is , although in a certain sense he has died not once but often along w[MASK]th those who had been firmly convinced that he was still ali[MASK]e . 
 Epictetus 
 Epi[MASK]tetus ( c . 55 – 135 ) was the slave to Nero 's scribe Epap[MASK]roditos . H[MASK] makes a few passing nega[MASK]ive comments o[MASK] Nero 's character in his work , but makes no remarks on the nature of [MASK]is rule . He describes Nero as a spoiled , angry and unhappy man . 
 Jos[MASK]phus 
 The historian Josephus ( [MASK] . 37 – 100 ) , while calling Nero a tyrant , was also the first to mention bias against Nero . Of other historians , he said : 
 But I omit any further discourse about these affairs ; for ther[MASK] have been a great many who have composed the history of Nero ; some of which have departed from the truth of facts out of favour , as hav[MASK]ng received benefits from him ; while others , out of hatred to him , and the great ill @-@ will which they bore him , have so impu[MASK]ently raved against him with their lies , that they justly deserve to be co[MASK]demne[MASK] . Nor do I wond[MASK]r at such as have told lies of Nero , since they have not in their writings preserved the truth of history as to those facts that were earlier th[MASK]n his time , even when the actors could have no way incurred their hatred , since those writers lived a long time after them . 
 Lucan 
 Though more of a poet than historia[MASK] , Lucanus ( c . 39 –[MASK]65 ) has one of the kindest accounts of Nero 's rule . He writes of peace and prosperity under Nero in contrast to previous war and strife . Ironically , he was later involved in a consp[MASK]racy to overthrow N[MASK]ro and was executed . 
 Philostratus 
 Philostratus II " the Athenian " ( c . 172 – 250 ) spoke of Nero in the Life of Apollonius Tyana ( Books 4 – 5 ) . Though he has a generally bad or dim view of Nero , he speaks of others ' positive reception of Nero in the East . 
 Pliny the Elder 
 The histor[MASK] of Nero by Pliny the Elder ( c . 24 – 79 ) did not survive . Still , there are severa[MASK] references to Nero in Pliny 's Natural Histo[MASK]ies . Pliny [MASK]as one of the [MASK]orst opinio[MASK]s of Nero and calls him[MASK]an " enemy of mankin[MASK] . " 
 Plutarch 
 Plutarch ( c . 46 – 127 ) mentions Nero indirectly[MASK]in his account of the Life of Galba and the Life of [MASK]tho . Nero is portrayed as a tyrant , but those that re[MASK]lace him are not described as better . 
 Seneca the Younger 
 It[MASK]is[MASK]not surprising that Seneca ( c . 4 BC – 65[MASK]) , Nero 's teacher and advisor , writes very [MASK]ell of Nero . 
 Suetonius 
 Suetonius ( c . 69 – 130 ) was a member of the equestrian order , and he was the head of the department of the imperial correspondence . While in [MASK]his position , Suetonius started writing [MASK]iogr[MASK]phies of the emperors , accentuating the anecdotal and sensational aspects . 
 Tacitus 
 Th[MASK] Annals by Tacitus ( c . 56 – 117 ) is the[MASK]most detailed and comprehensive [MASK]istory on the rule of Nero , despite being incomplete after the year 66 . Tacitus descri[MASK]ed the rule of[MASK]the Julio[MASK]@-@ Claudian emperors as generally unjust . He also thought th[MASK]t existing writing on them was unbalanced : 
 The [MASK]istories of Tiberius , Caius , Claudius and Nero , while they were[MASK]in power [MASK] were fa[MASK]sified [MASK]hrough terror , and after their death we[MASK]e written under the irritation of a recent hatred . 
 Tacitus [MASK]as the son of a procurator , who married into the elite family of Agricola . He entered his political life as a senator after Nero 's death and , by Tacitus ' own adm[MASK]ss[MASK]on , owed much to Nero 's rivals . Realising that this bias may be apparent to others , Tacitus protests that his writi[MASK]g [MASK]s true . 
 Girolamo Cardano 
 In 1562 Girolamo Cardano publish[MASK]d in Basel his Encomium Neronis , [MASK]hich was one of the firs[MASK] historical references of th[MASK] Modern era to p[MASK][MASK]tray Nero in a positiv[MASK] light .

[MASK]At [MASK]he end of 66 , conflict broke out between Greeks an[MASK] Jews in Jerusalem and Caesarea .[MASK]According to the Talmud , Nero went [MASK]o Jerusalem and shot arrows in all four directions . All the arrows landed in the city . [MASK]e then asked a passing child to repeat th[MASK] verse he had learned that d[MASK]y . [MASK]he child responded , " I will lay my vengeance upon Edom by [MASK]he hand of my people Israel " ( Ez . 2[MASK] @,@ 14 ) . Nero became terrified , believing that God wanted [MASK]he Temple in Jerusalem to be destroyed , but would punish the o[MASK]e to carry it out . Nero said , " [MASK]e desires to lay waste His House and to lay the blame on me , " whereupon he fled and converted to Judaism to avoid su[MASK]h retribution . Vespasian [MASK]as then dispa[MASK]ched to put down the rebellion . 
 The Talmud adds that the sage Reb Meir Baal HaNess , R[MASK]bbi Meir or Rabbi M[MASK]ir Baal HaNes ( Rabbi Meir the miracle ma[MASK]er ) was a Jewish sage who lived in the time[MASK]of the Mishna a prominent supporter of the Bar Kokhba rebellion against Roman[MASK]rule . He was considered one [MASK]f the g[MASK]eatest of the Tannaim of the third generat[MASK]on ( 139 @-@ 163 ) . According to the Talmud , his father was[MASK]a descendant of the Roman Emperor Nero who[MASK]had converted to Judaism . His wife Bruriah is one of the few w[MASK]men cited in the Gemara . He is the t[MASK]ird most frequently mentioned sage in the Mishnah . 
 Roman and[MASK]Greek sources nowhere report Nero 's alleged t[MASK]ip to Jerusalem or his alleged conversion to Judaism . There is also no record of Nero having any offspring who survived infanc[MASK] : his only recor[MASK]ed[MASK]child , Claudia Augusta , died aged 4 months . 
 
 = = = Christian traditi[MASK]n = = = 
 
 Non @-@ Christian historian Tacitus desc[MASK]ibes Nero exte[MASK]sively torturing and executing Christians after the fire of 64 . [MASK]uetonius also m[MASK][MASK]tions Nero punishing Christians , though he does so[MASK]because they are " given to a new and mischievous super[MASK]tition " and does not connect it with the fire . 
 Christian writ[MASK]r Tertulli[MASK]n ( c . 155 – 230 ) was the first to call Nero the first persecutor of Christians . He wrote , " Examine your records . Ther[MASK] you will find that Nero was the first that persecuted this doctrine " . Lact[MASK]ntius ( c . 240 –[MASK]320 ) also said that Nero " first persecuted the servants of God " . a[MASK] does Sulpicius Severus . However , Suetonius writes that , " since the Jews constantly made disturbanc[MASK]s at the instigation of Chrestus , he [ emperor Claudius ] expelled them[MASK]from Rome " ( " Iudaeos impulsore Chresto assidue tumul[MASK]uantis Roma expulit " ) . These expelled[MASK]" Jews " may have been early Christians , although Suetonius is not explicit . Nor is the [MASK]ible explicit , calling Aquil[MASK] of Pontus and his wife , Priscilla , both e[MASK]pelled[MASK]from Italy at the time , " Jews " .

 T[MASK]e f[MASK][MASK]st text to su[MASK]gest that Nero ordered[MASK]the execution [MASK]f an a[MASK]ostle[MASK]is a letter by Clement to the Corinthians traditional dated to around 96 A.D. The apocryphal Ascension of Isaiah , a Christian writing from the 2nd century says , " the slayer of his mother , who hi[MASK][MASK]elf ( even ) this king , will persecute the plant which the[MASK]Twelve Apostles of the Beloved have planted . Of the Twelve o[MASK]e will be delivered into his hands " was interpreted to mean Nero . 
 Bishop Eusebius of Caesarea ( c . 275 – 339 ) was the first to write explicitly that Paul was beheaded in Rome during the reign of Nero . He states that Nero 's persecution led to Peter and Paul 's deaths , but that Nero did not[MASK]give a[MASK]y specific orders . However[MASK], several other accounts going back to the 1st[MASK]century have Paul surviving his two years in Rome and travelling to Hispania , before facing trial in Rome again prior to his death . 
 [MASK]eter is first said to have been crucif[MASK]ed upside @-@ d[MASK]wn in Rome during Nero 's reign ( [MASK]ut not by Nero ) in the apocryphal Acts of Pete[MASK] ( c . 200 ) . The account ends with Paul still ali[MASK]e and Nero abiding by God 's c[MASK]mmand[MASK]not to persecute any more Christians . 
 By the 4th century , a number of writers were stating th[MASK]t Nero killed Peter and Paul . [MASK]

 The Sibylline[MASK]Oracles , Book 5 and 8 , writt[MASK]n in the 2nd century , speak of Nero returning and bringing destructi[MASK]n . Within Christian communities , these writings ,[MASK]along with others , fueled the belief that Nero would return as the Antichrist .[MASK]In[MASK]310 , Lactantius wrote that Nero " suddenly disappeared , and even the burial place of that noxious wild beast was nowhere to be seen . This has led some persons of extrav[MASK]gant imagination to suppose that , havi[MASK]g been conveyed to a distant region , h[MASK] is s[MASK]ill reserved alive ; and to him they apply the Sibylline verses " , Lactantius maintains that i[MASK] is not[MASK]right to believe this . 
 In 422 , Augustine of Hippo wrote about 2 [MASK]hessalonians 2 : 1 – 11 , where he believed Paul mentioned the coming of the Antichrist . Though he rejects th[MASK] theory [MASK] Augustine mentions that many Christians believed that Nero was [MASK]he Antichrist or would return as the An[MASK]i[MASK]hri[MASK]t . He wrot[MASK] , [MASK] so that in saying , ' For the [MASK]ystery of iniqui[MASK]y doth already work , ' he alluded to N[MASK]ro , whose deeds already seemed to be as the deeds of Antichrist . " 
 So[MASK]e modern biblical scholars such as Delbert Hillers[MASK]([MASK][MASK]ohns Hopkins Univ[MASK]rsity ) of the American Schools of Oriental Research and the editors of the Oxford & Harper Collins Study Bibles , contend tha[MASK] the number 666 in the Book of Revelation is a code for Nero , a view that is also supported in Roman Catholic Biblical commentaries . 
 The concept of Nero as the Antichrist is often a central belief of Preterist eschatology . 
 
 
 = Manila = 
 
 Manil[MASK] ( / məˈnɪl.ə / ) is the capital city of the Philippines , founded on June 24 , 1571 by Spanish conquistador Migu[MASK]l López de Legazpi . It is one of the oldest cities in the country and was the seat of power for [MASK]ost of the colonial rules of the Philippines . It is situated on the eastern shore of Manila Bay and contains a multi[MASK]ude of landmarks , some of which date back to[MASK]the 16th century , such as the Spanish colonial era Walled Ci[MASK]y of I[MASK]tramuros . 
 Ma[MASK]ila is the second most populous city in the Phi[MASK]ippines after the former capital Quezon City with a population of 1 @,@ 780 @,@ 148 in 20[MASK]5 . Because of its small land area and huge population , Manila is regarded as one of[MASK]the most densely popu[MASK]ated cit[MASK]es in the world with 42 @,@ 857[MASK]people [MASK]er square kilometer . Manila is one of the sixteen cities and a municipality that make up Metro Manila , the National Capital Region of the Philippines . In 2012 , Glob[MASK]lization and World C[MASK]ties[MASK]Researc[MASK] Network listed Manila as a globa[MASK] city . 
 Manila has six representative districts for the lower [MASK]ouse of the Philippine Congress . Furthermore , the city is composed of 16 districts , namely : Binondo , Ermita , Intramuros , Malate , P[MASK][MASK]o , Pandacan , Port Area , Quia[MASK]o , Sampaloc[MASK], Sa[MASK] Andres , San Miguel , San Nicolas , Santa Ana , Santa Cruz , Santa Mesa and Tondo . 
 The Kingdom of Ton[MASK]o onc[MASK][MASK]ruled in the vicinity of Manil[MASK] before it briefly became a province of[MASK]the Hindu Majapahit Empire . During the Brunei invasion [MASK]f the Philippines , Sultan[MASK]Bolkiah of Brunei captured [MASK]eludong ( a vill[MASK]ge in modern @-@ day Manila ) and renamed i[MASK][MASK]Maynilà , a Tagalog term refe[MASK]ring to the presence of the Nila shrub . Maynila was a vassal state of Brunei , established to overpower Tondo . Maynilà had been Indianized since the sixth century CE and earlier . It had become part[MASK]y [MASK]slamic and Hindu @-@ animist b[MASK] the 15th century CE . 
 In 1571 Spanish Conquistadors arrived from Me[MASK]ico , from across the Pacific , and founded present @-@ day Manila i[MASK] what today is Intramuro[MASK] . Spanish missionaries soon Christianized the city and incorporated Tondo under Manila and then built some[MASK]of the oldest churches in the country , including San Agustin Chu[MASK]ch . The Conquistad[MASK]rs renam[MASK]d the area Nuevo Reino de Castilla ( New Kingdom of Castille[MASK]) and shortened the name to M[MASK][MASK]ila . 
 Manila became the center of Spanish activity in the Far East and one en[MASK] [MASK]f [MASK]he Manila @-@ Acapulco Galleon trade route , linking Spa[MASK]ish America with Asia , one of the ea[MASK]liest examples of globalization . Due to the central loc[MASK]tion in the Pacific sea trade routes , Manila received [MASK]he moniker of the " Pearl of the Orient " . Spanish rule of Manila and the en[MASK]ire Philippine archipelago lasted for over three centuries , un[MASK]il 1898 . At different times during the long Spanish period there were local revolts , [MASK]hinese insurrections , massive pirate attacks , great earthquakes , Dutch [MASK]aids and invasion attempts , and a British occupation of the city dur[MASK]ng their unsuccessful attempt to conquer the Philippines . O[MASK]der was usua[MASK]ly quickly restored and the city returned to the business of trade . In th[MASK] 19th century Manila was one of the mos[MASK] modern cities in Asia . Before the [MASK]panish – American War , Manila saw the rise of the Philippine Revolution . Under the Am[MASK]rican rule following the Spanish – American War[MASK], the Un[MASK]ted States changed the offi[MASK]ial la[MASK]guage from Spanish to English[MASK]and made some changes in educ[MASK]tion , local l[MASK]ws and ur[MASK]an planning . Towards the end of World War II ,[MASK]during the Battle of Manila most of the cit[MASK] was flatt[MASK]n[MASK]d by intensive aerial bombardment b[MASK] the United[MASK]States Air Force . As a result , relatively [MASK]ittle remains of Manila 's prewar and colonial architecture , although there are ong[MASK]ing restoration projects , especially within the old w[MASK]lled city , Intramuros . [MASK]

 The earliest evidence of [MASK]uman life in and around the area of Manila is the nearby Angono Petroglyphs dated to around 3000 BC . Furthermore , negritos , a c[MASK]ass of Australoid peoples , became the aboriginal inhabitants of the Philippines . Th[MASK]y were found across Luzon before the Malayo @-@ Polynesians migrated in and assimilated them . 
 The Kingdom of To[MASK]do flourished during the[MASK]latter half of the Ming Dynasty [MASK]s a result of direct tra[MASK]e relations with China . Tondo district was ma[MASK]ntained as the traditional capital of the empire , with its rulers as sovereign kings and not mere chieftains , and[MASK]were addressed variously as panginuan ln Meranau or panginoón in Tagalog ( [MASK] lords " ) ; anák banwa ( " son of heaven " ) ; [MASK]r lakandula ( " lord of the palace " ) , the Emperor of China considered the Lakans [MASK] rulers of ancient Manila ) " 王 " ( K[MASK]ngs ) . 
 In the 13th century , Manila consisted of a fortified[MASK]settlement and trading quarter at the shores of the Pasig River , on top of previous old[MASK]r towns . [MASK]anila was then settled by the Indianized [MASK]mpire of Majapahit as referenced in the epic eulogy poem Nagarakretagama which inscribed its conquest by Maharaja Hayam Wuruk . Selurong " षेलुरोन ् [MASK] ् " which is a historical name for the city of M[MASK]nila is listed in Canto 14 alongside Sulot , which is now Sulu , and Kal[MASK]a . 
 During the reign of Sultan Bolkiah from 1485 to 1521 , the Bruneian Empi[MASK][MASK] invaded , wanting to take advantage of Tondo 's China trad[MASK] by attac[MASK]ing its environs and establishing " [MASK]وتا سلودوڠ Kota Saludong " ( The Kingdom of Maynila ) . They ruled under and gave yea[MASK]ly tribute to the Sul[MASK]anat[MASK] of Brunei as its satellite state . They es[MASK]a[MASK]lished a new dynasty under the local leader who accepted [MASK]slam and be[MASK]ame Rajah Salalila or [MASK]ariq Sulayman I. He also establish[MASK]d a trading challenge t[MASK] the a[MASK]r[MASK]ady rich[MASK]House of Lak[MASK]n Dula in Tondo . Islam was further strengthened by the arriv[MASK]l of Muslim traders from the Arab @-@ Indian area [MASK]nd Southeast Asia . [MASK]anila was t[MASK]mporarily besieged by the invasion of[MASK]Chinese [MASK]irate @-@ war[MASK]ord Limahong ( 1574 ) but was thwarted by the local[MASK]inhabitants , before it became[MASK]th[MASK] seat of the col[MASK]n[MASK]al government of Spain . 
 O[MASK] June 24 , 15[MASK]1 , Spanish conquistador Miguel López de Legazpi arri[MASK]ed from New Spain ( now Mex[MASK]co ) , and then exercised rule of the Spanish city of Manila as a territory of New Spain with the establis[MASK]ment of a city council in what today is the district of Intramuros . López de L[MASK]gazpi had the local royalty executed or exiled , after the failure of the To[MASK]do Conspiracy[MASK]; a plo[MASK] wherein an alliance between Japanese merchants , Luzon 's H[MASK]angs with several Datus and Rajahs plus the Br[MASK]neian Empire would band together to execute the Spaniards and their Latin @-@ Amer[MASK]can mercenaries , and Visayan allies . At the conclusion of which[MASK], the victorious Spaniards made Manila the capital of the Spanish East Indies and of the Philippines , which th[MASK] empire would control f[MASK]r the next three [MASK]enturies , from 15[MASK]5 to 1898 . 
 Manila then [MASK]ecame famous du[MASK]ing the Mani[MASK]a @-@ Acapulco Galleon trade which lasted for three centuries and[MASK]brought goods from Europe , Africa and Latin America across the Pacific Islands to [MASK]outheast[MASK]A[MASK]ia ( Which was already an entrepot for goods coming from [MASK]ndia , Indonesia and China ) and [MASK]rade al[MASK]o flowed vice ve[MASK]sa . Silver that was mined in Mex[MASK]c[MASK] and Peru were excha[MASK]ged for Chinese silk , Indian gems , and the spices of the Sou[MASK]heast Asia , some of which even flowed to Europe [MASK] Likewise wines and olives grown from Europe and North Africa were transshipped via Mexico towards Manila . 
 Manila was o[MASK]cupied by British forces for twenty months , from 1762 to 1764 , and used [MASK]s a[MASK]base for an unsuccessful a[MASK]tempt to con[MASK]uer the Philippines during the Seven Years[MASK]' War . Eventually , the British withdrew from Manila[MASK]as p[MASK]r agreements in the 1763 Treaty of Paris . [MASK]he Chinese were punished for supporting the British invasion , and the small fortress @-@ city of Intramu[MASK]os , mostly populat[MASK]d by Europeans and Mexicans , kept its cannons pointed at Binondo , the [MASK]orld 's oldest Chinatown . 
 Mexican Independe[MASK]ce in 1821 necessitated direct rul[MASK] from Spain . Under direct Spanish rule , banking , ind[MASK]stry and education flourished more than it had in the previou[MASK] two[MASK]centuries . The opening [MASK]f the Suez Canal in 1869 facilitated dir[MASK]ct trade and [MASK]ommunications with Spain . 
 The growing wealth and educ[MASK]tion attra[MASK]te[MASK] indigenou[MASK] , Chinese , Indi[MASK]ns , Latinos , and Europeans from the provinces to Manila , all of whom elected a nascent Filipino citizenship regardless of e[MASK]hnici[MASK]y . The developments also facilitated the rise of an illustrado class which [MASK]spoused libe[MASK]al ideas , the ideological foundations of the Philippine Revolution which sought independence from Spain . 
 After the Battle of Mani[MASK]a ( 1[MASK]98 ) , Spain ceded the surrendered city of Manila to the United States . The First Philippine Republic b[MASK]sed[MASK]at nearby Bulacan fought against the American[MASK] for control of the [MASK]ity of Manila . [MASK][MASK]e Americans defeated the First Philippine Republic and captured pres[MASK]dent Emilio Aguinaldo who announced allegiance to the United States on April 1 , 1901 . 
 Upon drafting a new charter for Manil[MASK] in June 1901 , t[MASK]e Americans made official what [MASK]ad long been tacit : that the City of Manila was not Intramuros alone but also all its arrabales . The new city charter proclaimed that [MASK]anila was composed of eleven municipal districts — [MASK]resum[MASK]bly Tondo , Binondo , Santa Cruz , Sampaloc , San Miguel , Pandacan , Santa Ana , Paco , Malate , Ermita and Intramuros . In addition to these , the Church recognized five parishes as Manileno — namely , Gagalangin , Trozo , Balic @-@ Bali[MASK] , Santa Mesa and Singalong . Later times would ad[MASK] two more : Balut and San Andres [MASK]ukid . 
[MASK]Under American control , a new civilian oriented Insular Government headed by then Gover[MASK]or @-@ General William Howard Taft invited city planner Da[MASK]iel Burnham for the trans[MASK]ormation of Manila , to adapt the old city to changed times an[MASK] modern nee[MASK]s . The Burnham Plan included develop[MASK]ent of the road system , the use of waterways for transportation ,[MASK]and beautif[MASK]cation of Manila with the improve[MASK]ent of waterfronts , construction of parks , parkways and var[MASK]ous building for various activities . 
 The latter included a government c[MASK]nter occupy[MASK]ng all of Wallace Field , wh[MASK]ch extends from Luneta to[MASK]the present Taft[MASK]Avenue . The Philippin[MASK] Ca[MASK]itol was to rise at the Taft Avenue end of the field , facing towar[MASK] the sea , and would f[MASK]rm , with t[MASK]e buildings of different government bureaus and departments , a quadrangle , lagoon in the center , and a monument to José R[MASK]zal a[MASK] its Luneta end . Of[MASK]Burnham 's proposed gov[MASK]rnment center , only three unit[MASK] — [MASK]he[MASK]Legislative Building and the building[MASK]of the Finance and[MASK]Agricultural departments — were completed when World War II [MASK]rupted . 
 Due to t[MASK]e Japanese occupation of the Philippines , Ameri[MASK]an soldiers were ordered to withdraw[MASK]from the ci[MASK]y an[MASK] all military installations were removed on December 24 , 1941 . General D[MASK]uglas MacArthur declared Manil[MASK] an open city to prevent further death an[MASK] destr[MASK]ction ; de[MASK]pite this , the Japanese warplanes continued to bomb the[MASK]city . Manila was occupied by the Japanese forc[MASK]s on [MASK]anuary 2 , 1942 . 
 Manila was also the site of the bloodiest battle in the Pacific theater during the Second World War . After fa[MASK]ling to the Empire of Japan on January 2 , 1942 , [MASK][MASK] was recaptured by joint American and Filipino troops from February 3 to March 3 , 1945 . Some 100 @,@ 000 civilians were killed in Manila in February 1945 . It was the second most devastated city i[MASK] the world after Warsaw[MASK]during the Second World War . At the end of World W[MASK][MASK] II , almost all of [MASK]he structures in the city , particularly Intramuros , wer[MASK] destroy[MASK]d but after the war , reconstruc[MASK]ion took place . 
 In 1948 , President Elpidio Quirino moved the seat of government of the P[MASK]ilippines to Quezon City[MASK], a new capital city in the suburbs and fields nor[MASK]heast of Manila , created in 1938 by former President Manuel L. Quezon , which was named after him . The move ended any[MASK]implementation of the Burnham Plan 's[MASK]intent for the government centre to be at Luneta . 
 With the Visayan @-@ born Arsenio Lacson as its first elected mayor in 1952 ( all mayors were appointed pr[MASK]or to this ) , Manila underwen[MASK] The Golden Ag[MASK] , once again earning its status as[MASK]th[MASK] " Pearl [MASK]f th[MASK] Orient " , a moniker it earned before the Second World War . After Lacson 's term in the 1950s , Manila was led by Antonio Villegas for most of [MASK]he 1960s . Ramon Bagatsing ( an Indian @-@ Filipino ) was mayor for nearly the entire 1970[MASK] until the 1986 People Power Revolution . Mayors Lacson , Vil[MASK]egas , and Bagatsing are often collectively [MASK][MASK]nside[MASK]ed as the[MASK]" Big[MASK]Three of Manila " less for their rather long tenures as the city 's chief executive ( continuously for over three decades , [MASK]rom 1952 – 1986 ) , but more for their indelible[MASK]contribution to the development and progress of the city and their lasting legacy in uplifting the qual[MASK]ty of life and welfare of the people of [MASK]anila . 
 During the a[MASK]ministration of President Ferdinand Marcos[MASK], the region of the Metro Manila was created as an integrated unit with the enactment of Presidential Decree No. 824 on November 7 , 1975 . The area encompassed four cities and thirteen adjoining towns , as a sep[MASK]rate regional unit of government . On the 4[MASK]5th anniversary of the city 's foundation on [MASK]une 24 , 1976 , Manila was[MASK]re[MASK]nstated by Marcos as the capital of the Philippines for its historical significance as the seat of government since the Spanish Period . President[MASK]al Decree [MASK]o. 940 states [MASK]hat Manila has alwa[MASK]s been to the Filipino people and in the eyes of [MASK]he world , the premier city of the Philippines being the center of trade , commerce , education and culture . 
 During the martial law era , Manila became a hot @-@ bed of resistance activity as youth and student demonstrators repeatedly clashed with the police and [MASK]ilitary [MASK]hich were subservient to the Marcos regime . After dec[MASK]des of resistan[MASK]e , the non @-@ violent People Power Revolution ( predecessor to the peace[MASK]ul @-@ revolutions that toppled the iron[MASK]@-@ curtain in Europe ) , ous[MASK]ed the authoritarian[MASK]Marcos from power . 
 In 1992 , Alfr[MASK]do Lim was elected mayor , [MASK]he first Chinese @-@ Filipino to[MASK]hold the office . He w[MASK]s known for his anti @-@ crime crusades . Lim was succeeded[MASK]by Lito Atienza , who served as his vice @-@ mayor . Atienza was known for his campaign ( and city slogan ) " Buhayi[MASK] ang Maynila " ( Revive Manila ) , which saw the establishment [MASK]f several parks and th[MASK] repair and re[MASK]abilitation of the city 's deteriorating facilities . He was the city 's mayor f[MASK]r 3 terms ([MASK]9 years ) before being termed out of[MASK]office . 
 Alfredo Lim once [MASK]gain ran for mayor and defeated Atienza 's son Ali in the 2[MASK]07[MASK]city election and immediately reversed a[MASK]l of Atienza 's projects claiming Atienza 's projects made little c[MASK]ntribution to the improv[MASK]men[MASK]s of the cit[MASK] . The relationship of both [MASK]arties turned bitter , with the t[MASK]o pitting again during the 2010 city elections in which Lim won against Atienza . 
 Lim was sued by councilor Dennis Alcoreza on 2008 ove[MASK] human rights , charg[MASK]d with[MASK]graft o[MASK]er the rehabilitation of public schools , and was he[MASK]vily criticized for his h[MASK]ph[MASK]zard resolution of [MASK]he Rizal Park hostage taking incident , one of the deadliest hostage crisis in the Phi[MASK]ippines . Later on , Vice Mayor Isko Moreno and [MASK]8 city councilors filed another case against Lim in 2012 , s[MASK]ati[MASK]g that Lim 's statement in a meeting were " life @-@ threat[MASK]ning " to them . On the 2013 elections , former President Joseph Estrada defeated Lim in the mayo[MASK]al race . During his term , Estra[MASK]a has paid the city 's over ₱ [MASK] billion [MASK]ebts , increase revenues by 2 @.@ 35 times from ₱ 6 @.@ 2 billion in 2012 to ₱ 14 @.@ 6 billion by 2016 , spent from 2013 to 2016 an unprecedented ₱ 6 @.@ 76 billion for the city 's infrastruc[MASK]ure , built and[MASK]or renovated seven city public markets , b[MASK]ilt 22 s[MASK]hools , increased teachers [MASK] incomes , modernized the six city hospitals and bought dialysis machines and magnetic resonance [MASK]maging scanners , increased the efficiency of the police force and reduced crime . Ma[MASK]ila has become the most competitive city in the Philippines b[MASK] 2015 , making the city the best plac[MASK] for doing business and for li[MASK]ing in . 
 Despite his achievements and un[MASK]recedented feat as the Mayor of Manila , however , Estrada was re @-@ elected as Manila mayor in the 2016 ele[MASK]tion against Lim and Amado Bagatsing , only winning by an infinitesimal 2 [MASK],@ 830 votes .

 Under the Köppe[MASK] climate cla[MASK]sification system , Manila features a tropical savanna climate ( Köppen climate classification Aw ) . Together with the rest of the Philippines[MASK], Manila lies entirely within the tropics . Its proximity to the equator means that the temperature range is very small , rar[MASK]ly going [MASK]elow 20 ° C ( 68 ° F[MASK]) or abov[MASK] 38 ° C ( 100 ° F ) .

 Manila has archi[MASK]ecturally significant buildings in a wide range of styles spanning distinct historical and cultural periods . Arc[MASK]itectural styles reflect American , Spanish , Chine[MASK]e , and Malay influences . Prominet Filipino architects such as Antonio Toledo , Felipe Roxas , Juan M. Arell[MASK]no and Tomás Mapúa have designed[MASK]signific[MASK]nt bu[MASK]ldings in Manila such as churches , government offices , theaters , mansions , schools and universities . 
 Manila is known for its distinct Art Deco theaters [MASK]hich are designed by National A[MASK]tists such as Juan N[MASK]kpil a[MASK]d Pablo Antonio . The historic Escolta[MASK]Street in Binondo features many buildings of neo @-@ classical and beaux @-@ arts[MASK]architectura[MASK] style[MASK], many of which we[MASK]e designed by prominent Filipino architects [MASK]uring the American Rule in the 1920s to the late 1930s . Many archi[MASK]ects , artists , historians and heritage advocacy groups are pushing for the reviva[MASK] of Escolta Street , which wa[MASK] once the p[MASK]emier street of the Philip[MASK]ines . 
 Unfortunately , much of Manila 's[MASK]prewar and Spanish colonial architecture was destroyed duri[MASK]g World War II . Reconstruction took place afterwards , replacing the destroyed hi[MASK]toric Spanish @-@ era buildings with modern ones , erasing much of the city 's character . Some buildings destroyed by the war have been rec[MASK]nstructed , such as the Old Legisl[MASK]tive[MASK]Building ( National Museum ) , Ayunta[MASK]iento de Manila ( Bureau [MASK]f the Treasury ) and the currently under c[MASK]nstruction San Ignacio Church ( Museo de[MASK]Intr[MASK]muros ) . Plans have been laid out to rehabilitate se[MASK][MASK]ral neglected histo[MASK]ic [MASK]uildings and places such[MASK]as Plaza Del Car[MASK]en , San Sebastian Church and the Manila Metropolitan Theater and soon Spanish @-@ e[MASK]a shops and houses in Quiapo , Binondo , and San Nicolas will be restored to its former splendor , as a part of a movement to restore Manila to its former glory . 
 Since Manila is [MASK][MASK]one to earthquakes , the Spanish colonial architects invented the style called Earthqu[MASK]ke Baroque which the churches a[MASK]d government buildings during the Spani[MASK]h colonial period adopted . As a result , succeeding earthquakes of the 18th and 1[MASK]t[MASK] centuries barely affected Manila , although it did periodic[MASK]lly level[MASK]the surroundin[MASK] [MASK]rea .

 Manila , being the seat of political power of the Philippines , has several nati[MASK]nal government offices headquartered at the city . Planning [MASK]or the development for being the center of government started during the early years [MASK]f American colonization to the[MASK]country when they envisioned a well @-@ designed city outside the walls of Intramuros . The strategic location chosen was Bagumbayan , a former town which is now the Rizal Park to become the [MASK]enter of government and a [MASK]esign commissio[MASK] was given to Daniel Burnham to create a master plan for the city patterned after Washington[MASK]D.C .. These impr[MASK]vements were eventually abandoned under the Commonwealth Go[MASK]ernment of Manuel L. Quezon . 
 A new government center [MASK]as to b[MASK] built on the hills northeast of Manila , [MASK]r what is now Quezon City . Several government agencies have set up their headquarters in[MASK]Quezon City but several key government offices still reside in Manila . [MASK]owever , many of [MASK]he plans were substantially altered after[MASK]the devastation of Manila during World War II and by subsequent administrations . 
 The city , as the capital , s[MASK]ill hosts the Office of the Pre[MASK]ident[MASK], as w[MASK]ll as the president 's official residence . Aside from these , impor[MASK]ant ins[MASK]ituti[MASK]ns such as the Supreme Court , the Court of Appeals , the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas , the Departments of Budget and Management , Finance , [MASK]eal[MASK]h , Justice , Labor and Employment and Public Works and Hi[MASK]hways still call the[MASK]city home . Manila also hosts important national i[MASK]stitutions such as the National Library , National Archives , National Museum and the Philipp[MASK]ne General Hospital .

 Attalea is a large genus of palms native to Mexico , the Caribbean , C[MASK]ntral and [MASK]ou[MASK]h America .[MASK]This pinn[MASK]tely leaved , non @-@ spiny genus includes both small palms lacking an aboveground stem and large trees . The genus has a complic[MASK]ted taxonomic history , and has often been split into four or five genera based on differences in the male flowers . Since the genera can only be distinguished on the basis of their male f[MASK]owers , the existence of intermediate flower types and the existen[MASK]e of hybrids between different genera has[MASK]been used as an argument fo[MASK] keeping them all in the same genus . This has been supported by a recent molecul[MASK]r phylogeny . 
 Somewhere [MASK]etween 29 and 67 species are recognised in the genus , with estimates of as many as 1[MASK]0 . Incomplete herbarium collections make it difficult to determine[MASK]whether certain groups represent single species , or gr[MASK]ups of similar species . Attalea species have a long history of human use , [MASK]nd include economically important sources of p[MASK]lm oil and fibre . Many species are fire tolerant[MASK]a[MASK]d thrive in disturbed habitats . Their seeds are anima[MASK] dispersed , including some wh[MASK]ch are thought to have been adapted [MASK]or dispersal by now @-@ extinct Pleistocene megafauna .

 The [MASK]enus[MASK]Attale[MASK] has pinnately compound leaves — rows of leaflets emerge on either side of the axis of the leaf in a feather @-@ like or fern @-@ like pattern . Species are also non @-@ spiny palms a[MASK]d includes both large trees with stout stems up to 30 metres ( 98[MASK]ft ) tall and[MASK]acaulescent palms ( one which lack an above[MASK]roun[MASK] s[MASK]em ) . The number of leaves per individual varies from about three to thirty @-@ five ; larger pla[MASK]ts tend[MASK]to have more and longer leaves . 
 Inflorescences are large , branched and borne among the leaves [MASK] The inflorescen[MASK]e consists of a main axis — the[MASK]peduncle and the rachis — and[MASK]a series of smaller branches , the rachillae . The rachillae , which bear the fl[MASK]wers , emerge from the rachis . The peduncle is the main stalk , connecting the rachis with the stem . Inflorescences either consist entirely of male flowers , or are predomina[MASK][MASK]ly female with a few male flowers . F[MASK]uit usually have two or three seeds , although fewer or more are present in some species , and are usually brown , yello[MASK] , orange @-[MASK] brown or purple when mature . 
 Four different types of male flowers[MASK]exist . On the basis of these flower types , the genus has often been split into four genera — a more narrowly defined Attalea ,[MASK]Orbignya , Maximiliana an[MASK] Scheelea . The species sometimes referred to Orbignya have coiled anthers , while the other groups[MASK]have straight ones . The pe[MASK]als of those placed in Maximiliana are much shorter than th[MASK] stamens , while those placed in Scheelea and a mor[MASK] narrowly defined Attalea ha[MASK]e [MASK]etals that are longer than the stamens . Five species do not fit easily into any of these groups ; t[MASK]is fact has been use[MASK] as an argument in favour of considering this group a sin[MASK]le genus . 
 
 = = Taxonomy = = 
 
 Attalea has been placed in the subfamily Arecoideae [MASK] the tribe Cocoseae and the subtribe Attaleinae , together with the genera Allagoptera , Beccariophoenix , Butia , Cocos , Jubaea , Jubaeopsis , Ly[MASK]oca[MASK]yum , Parajubaea [MASK] Syagrus and Voanioala . Withi[MASK] this s[MASK]btribe , Attalea has been found to be a monophyletic group , and sister to the clade containing Allagoptera , Polyandrococos , Parajubaea , Butia and Jubaea . 
 Disagreement exists as to whether Attalea should be considered[MASK]a single genus , or a group of related ge[MASK]era . In their 1996 Field G[MASK]ide to the Palms of the Americas , Andrew Henderson , Gloria Galeano and Rodrigo Berna[MASK] combined all the specie[MASK] in the subtribe Attaleinae ( as it was then defined ) into a single genus , Attalea . In his 1999 Taxonomic Treatment of Palm Subtribe Attaleinae , American botan[MASK]st Sidney F. Glassman divided the group [MASK]nto five genera — a more narrowly defined Attalea , Orbignya , Max[MASK]miliana , Scheelea and Ynesa . Rafäel Govaerts and John Dransfield recognised a single genus in their 2005 World Checklist of Palms , a[MASK]d Jean @-@ Christophe Pintaud continued th[MASK]s usage in his 2008 review of the genus . [MASK] The [MASK]ulti @-@ gen[MASK]s approach is based solely on t[MASK]e structure of t[MASK]e male flowers ; no other characters could be consistently associated with one genus or another . Four of the genera — Attalea ( in a narrow sense ) , Orbignya , Maximiliana and Scheele[MASK] — correspond to four different typ[MASK]s of male flowers found wi[MASK]hin the genus . However , a few species have flowers that are intermediate between these four types , including A.[MASK]colenda ( which Glassman placed in its own genus , Ynesa ) and this has been used as an argumen[MASK] for the s[MASK]ngle[MASK]@-@ genus approach . In addition , there are several hybrids between species that would be considered different genera under Glassman 's five @-@ genus system , which has also been used as an argument for placi[MASK]g them in a single genus .[MASK]In [MASK]009 Alan Meerow and co[MASK]leagues published a molecu[MASK]ar phyloge[MASK]y of[MASK]the subtribe which found that some species placed in Orbignya were actually more closely related to specie[MASK] placed in Sch[MASK]elea than they were to other m[MASK]mbers of that genus ( if the five @-@ genus approach was used ) , while A. crassispatha , placed in Orbi[MASK]nya by Glassman , was actually a sister to both Scheelea and Orbignya . 
 
 = = = History = = = 
 
 The genus Attalea was first described Carl[MASK]Si[MASK]ismund Ku[MASK]th in 1816 based on specimens[MASK]collected by Alexander von Humboldt and Aimé Bonpland , althoug[MASK] older , pre @[MASK]@ Linnaean description[MASK] exist , including Charles Plumi[MASK]r 's 1703 description of A. crassispat[MASK]a . The genus was nam[MASK]d for Attalus III Philometor , king of[MASK]Pergamon , known for his interest in medicinal plants . The type species is A. amygdalina , a Colombian endemic . The genera Maximil[MASK]ana and Orbignya were described by Carl Friedrich Philipp v[MASK]n Martius in 1826 and 1837 respectively . Sc[MASK]eelea was described by Hermann Karsten in 1857 , and Ynesa by Orator F. Cook in 1942 . 
 
 = = = Species = =[MASK]= 
 
 Experts disagree about the number of species in the genus Attalea ( broadly defined ) . In 1965 , Dutch taxonomis[MASK] Jan Gerard Wessel[MASK] Boer estimated that there may be as many as 100 species in the genus . In their 1996 Field Guide to the Palms of t[MASK]e Americas Andrew He[MASK]derson and coau[MASK]hors recognised 29 species in the genus , while Sidney Glassman recognised 65 species in his 1999 [MASK]reatment of the group . Largely following Glassman 's lead , Rafaël Govaerts and John Dransfield recognised 67 species in their 2005 World Checklist of Palms . An important element of this disagreement is the decision by Glassman to define species more narrowly than Henderson . As a result , what He[MASK]de[MASK]son interpreted as variation within species , Glassman took as differences between morphologicall[MASK] similar species . This prob[MASK]em is complicated by the fact that many of these species are poorly represented in herbarium collect[MASK]ons . The large size of [MASK]he leaves , inflorescences and fruit of many Attalea species makes them difficult[MASK]to coll[MASK]ct . In addition , many import[MASK]nt collections , including type specimen , have been lost or destroyed . Sparse or incomplete collections make it diffic[MASK]lt to differentiate var[MASK]ation wi[MASK]hin a single species fr[MASK]m variation between different species . 
 The three re[MASK]ent treatments ( Henderson and coauthors , Glassman , and Govaerts and Dransfield ) recognised a total of 73 species , but only 20 species [MASK]re accepted by all of them . The remainder account for ei[MASK]her nine species or more than 40 . For example , what Andrew Henderson considered a single species , Attalea attaleoides , other authors have considered a species comple[MASK] consisting of four or five species . Gl[MASK]ssman doubted the vali[MASK]ity of A. attaleoides as a species , and described four new specie[MASK][MASK]fr[MASK]m material [MASK]hat had previously been attributed to A. attaleoides — A. camopiensis , A. degranvillei , A. guianensis and A. [MASK]aripensis . Govaerts and Dransfield accepted both Glassman 's four species and A. attaleoides . However , Jean @-@ Ch[MASK]istophe [MASK]intaud was of the opinion that A. guianensis , A. maripensis and A. attaleoides were all very si[MASK]ilar , and thought it likely that they all represented the[MASK]same species . 
 Another species complex in Attalea includes A. speciosa and[MASK]related species . Henderson ( 1995 ) recognised A. speciosa and A. spectabilis , considering the latter to either be an acaulescent form of A. [MASK]peciosa or a hybrid between it and A. microcarpa . Govaerts and Dransfield accepted A. spectabilis , bu[MASK] Glassman considered it a dubious taxon . Attalea vitrivir was recognised as a distinct species by Michael Balick and coauthors ; Glassm[MASK]n and Govaerts and Dransfie[MASK]d concurred , but Henderson cons[MASK]dered it [MASK]art of A. speciosa . Glassman also described[MASK]a fou[MASK]th m[MASK]mber of t[MASK]is group , A. brejinhoensis , an[MASK] it is accepted by Govaerts and Dransfield . 
 
 = = Reproduction and growth = = 
 
 Attalea species[MASK]are monoecious — male and female flowers are separate , but are borne by the same plant . Various species have been described as being[MASK]insect @-@ pollinated , including A. phalerata ,[MASK]while pollination in A. colenda and A. speciosa , has been attributed both to [MASK]nsects and[MASK]wind . 
 Seed germination is remote tubular — during germ[MASK]nat[MASK]on , as the cotyle[MASK]on expands it pushes the young[MASK]shoot a[MASK]ay from the seed . After germination , the stem initially grows downw[MASK]rd before turning to grow u[MASK]ward and produce the aboveground stem [MASK] This produces a " saxo[MASK]hone shaped " belowground portion of the stem . The fact that the shoot t[MASK]ps of Attalea seedlings are un[MASK]erground it likely to c[MASK]ntribute to their fire @-@ tolera[MASK]ce . 
 
 = = Distribution = = 
 
 Species range across the Neotropics from Mexico in the north to[MASK]Bolivia , Paraguay , and south[MASK]rn Brazil in the south . Acc[MASK]rd[MASK]ng to Gov[MASK]e[MASK]ts and coauthors , three species are found in Mexico , four in Central [MASK]merica , and [MASK]2 in South America . Three species are [MASK]resent in the Caribbean — two in Trinidad and Tobago , along [MASK]he southern edge of the region , and one in H[MASK]iti . 
 
 = = Habitat and ecology = = 
 
 Attalea includes both large trees and small acaulescent palms which occupy a[MASK]number[MASK]of different ecological niches . Dense [MASK]tands of some of th[MASK] larger speci[MASK]s are conspicuous [MASK]lements on the landscape , while smaller species are found in both in the forest understorey and in savannas . 
 Disturbance has been implicated in the formation of vegetation dominated by large Attalea s[MASK]ecies . In seasonally dry Amazonian forests the de[MASK]sity of large adult A. maripa palms was correlated with canopy openness ; the species also dominates savannas [MASK]ormed by repeat[MASK]d forest fires in Trinidad and Tobago . Attalea speciosa forms pure[MASK]stands in many parts of Brazil where natural forest veg[MASK]tation has been clear[MASK]d . Similarly , stands of A. funifer[MASK] in Bahia[MASK], Braz[MASK]l ( which are cultivated for piassava fibre ) are managed using fire — the seedlings survive cuttin[MASK] and[MASK]burning , and a[MASK]e able to dominate burned forest patches . 
 The fruit are dispersed by animals ; fruit which are not dispersed frequently suffer seed [MASK]redation by bruchid beetles . Certain species of Attalea have been mentioned as [MASK]xamples of " anachro[MASK]istic " species which are[MASK]adapted for dispersal by now @-@ extinct Pleistocene meg[MASK]fauna . On Maracá Island , Roraima[MASK], in the Brazilian Amazon , Attalea [MASK]aripa fruit were consumed by tapirs , collared peccaries , deer and primates . Rodents , including agout[MASK]s , fed upon the fruit and , as the fruit availability declined , they fed on the seeds . [MASK]ther dispers[MASK]rs of Atta[MASK]ea fruit include Cre[MASK]ted Caracaras which consume the fruit and disperse the seeds of [MASK]. phalerata in the Braz[MASK]lian Pantanal . 
 
 = = Uses = = 
 
 Attalea spec[MASK]es h[MASK]ve a long history of human utilisation . Carbonised Attalea maripa s[MASK]eds h[MASK]ve been found in archaeological sites in Colombia dating back to 9000 BP . A variety of species remain important sources of e[MASK]ible oil , thatch , edible seeds and fibre . The leaves of Attalea butyrac[MASK]a and A. maripa are used extens[MASK]vely for thatc[MASK]ing . Several species are[MASK]oil palm[MASK] , with A. speciosa among the most important economically . P[MASK]oducts extracted from A. spe[MASK]iosa were reported to support over 300 @,@ 000 households in the Brazilian state of Maranhão in 2005 , and in 1985 it was estimated to s[MASK]pport over 450 @,@ 000 households throughout the Brazil . [MASK]i[MASK]ssava fibres , extracted from the leaf bases of A. funife[MASK]a , are commercially important , and [MASK]enera[MASK]ed about U[MASK] $ 20 million in annual income to Brazilian farmers in 1996 .

 Th[MASK] Heart of Ezra Gr[MASK]er is a 1917 American silent d[MASK]ama film produced by [MASK]he[MASK]Thanhouser Company and direc[MASK]ed by Emil[MASK] Cha[MASK]tard . The film focuses on Ezra Greer , a successful middle @-[MASK] aged man who search[MASK]s for his college age daughter , Mary . The wayward Mary was romanced and abandoned by Jack Denbeigh , later bearing his child . Once Ezra becomes broke he finds employment as the valet for Jack Denbeigh . After Jack 's eng[MASK]gement to a cabaret girl , Mary becomes u[MASK]set and leaves her child at Jack 's home . Contrary to Jack 's wishes , Ezra keeps the child and Jack ultimately reveals that the child [MASK]s his o[MASK]n . Ezra convinces Jack to[MASK]make things right[MASK]and Ezra convinces the cabaret girl [MASK]o leave Jack . A[MASK]ter a carriage accident in which the baby is injured , Ezra and Jack rush to the hospital and find Mary as a nurse crying over the child . The film ends with the ma[MASK]riage of Jack a[MASK]d Mary . The film was released by Pathé on October 7 , 1917 . The film was the final release from Thanhouser and was deemed to be an average film by most reviewers . Criticism for the film hinged on far @-@ fetched coincidences to drive the plot . The film is presumed lost .

 The film was the final production and rele[MASK]se of the Thanhouser Company and it was to be released th[MASK]ough Pathé . Numerous fa[MASK]tors wo[MASK]ld play into the winding down and eventual closing of the Thanhouser[MASK]Film Corporation with much advance notice by Edwin Thanhouser . Q.

 Th[MASK] five reel film was released through the Pathé [MASK]xchange as a Pa[MASK]hé Gold Roos[MASK]er Play on October 7 , 1917 . Charles E. Wagner of the Exhibitor 's Trade Review found it to be a go[MASK]d film with great direction and photography , but was concerned that the stunt in which the baby appeared to [MASK]e involved in the accident was too[MASK]real . Wagner stated the film had sufficient action and pathos without sexua[MASK] suggestive[MASK]ess ; which should prove a strong program for the Pathé program . Frances Agnew of The Morning Telegraph found it to be an average picture that was not exceptional for audiences , bu[MASK] it would hold sentimental appeal for the average viewer . A reviewer for the The New York Dramatic Mirror found the film 's excessiv[MASK] use of coincidental meetings to be highly improbable , but fo[MASK]nd Warde 's performance to be excellent and the rest of the cast give good performances .

 = Free Derry = 
 
 [MASK]ree Derry ( Irish : Sao[MASK] Dhoire ) [MASK]as a self @-@ declared autonomous nationalist area of Derry , Northern Ireland , that ex[MASK]sted between 1969 and[MASK]19[MASK]2 . Its name [MASK]as taken from a sign painted on a gable wall in the Bogside in January 1969 which read , " You are now entering Free Derry " . The area , which included the Bogside and Creggan neighbourhoods , was secured by community activists for the first time on 5 January 1969 following an incursion into the Bogside by members of the Royal Ulster Constabulary ( RUC [MASK] . Residents built barricades and carried clubs and simil[MASK]r arms to prev[MASK]nt the RUC from entering .[MASK]After six days the residents [MASK]ook do[MASK]n the barricades an[MASK] RUC patrols resumed , but tensions remained high over the following month[MASK] . 
 Vio[MASK]ence reached a peak on 12 August 1969 , culminating in the Battle of the Bogsi[MASK]e — a three @-@ day pitched battle between residents and the RUC . On 14 August units of the British Army were deployed at the edge of the Bogside and the RUC were withdrawn . The Derry Citizens Defence Association ( DCDA ) declared their intention to hold the area against both the RUC [MASK]nd the British Army until their dema[MASK]ds were met . The British Army made no attempt to enter the area . The sit[MASK]ation continued un[MASK]il October 1969 [MASK]hen , following publication of the Hunt Report , military police were allowed in . 
 The[MASK]Irish Republican Army ( IRA ) began to re @-@[MASK]arm and recruit after Aug[MASK]st 1969 . In December 1[MASK]69 it split into the Official IRA and the Provisional IRA [MASK] [MASK]oth were supported by the [MASK]eople of the F[MASK]ee Derry area . Meanwhile , relations between the British Army and the nationalist community , which were initially g[MASK]od , deteriorated . In July 1971 there was a surge of recruitment into the IRA after two[MASK]young men were shot and killed by B[MASK]itish troops . The government introduced internment on 9 August 1971 , and[MASK]in re[MASK]ponse , barric[MASK]des went up once more in the Bogside and Creggan . This time , Free[MASK]Derry was a no @-@ go area , defended by armed members of bo[MASK]h the Official and Provisional IRA . From within the area they launched attacks on the British Army , and the Provisionals began a bombing ca[MASK]paign in the city centre . As before , unarmed ' auxiliaries ' manned t[MASK]e barricades , and crime was dealt with by a voluntary body known as the Free Derry Police . 
 Support for the IRA increased further after Bloody Sunday in January 1972 , when thirteen unarmed m[MASK]n and bo[MASK]s were shot dead [MASK]y the British Army 's Parachute Regiment at a march in the Bogside ( a 14th man was wounded and died 4 ½ months later ) . The support began t[MASK] wane after the killing by the Officia[MASK] IRA of a local y[MASK]uth who wa[MASK] home on leave from t[MASK]e British Army . After a Provisional IRA ceasefire , during which it entered talks with the British governmen[MASK] , broke down , th[MASK] British took the decision to move against [MASK]he " no @-@ go " areas . Free Derry came to an end on 31 July 1972 , when thousands of British troops moved in with armoured cars and b[MASK]lldozers to occupy the area .

 Derry City lies near the border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland . It has a majority nationalist population , and nationalists won a majority of seats in the 1920 l[MASK]cal elections . Despite this , the Ulster Unionist Party con[MASK]rolled the local cou[MASK]cil , Londonderry Corporation ,[MASK]from 1923 onwar[MASK]s . The [MASK]nionists maintained thei[MASK] majority , firstly[MASK], [MASK]y manipulating the constituency boundaries ( gerrymandering ) so that the Sou[MASK]h Ward , with a nationalist majority , returned eight councillors while the much smaller North Ward and Waterside Ward , with unionist majorities , returned[MASK]tw[MASK]lve councill[MASK]rs be[MASK]ween[MASK]them ; secondly , by allowing on[MASK]y ratepayers to v[MASK]te[MASK]in local elections , rather than one man , one vote , so that a higher number of nationalists[MASK], who did not own homes , were disenfranchised ; an[MASK] thirdly , by denyi[MASK][MASK] houses to nationalists outsid[MASK] the South Ward c[MASK]nstituency . The resul[MASK] was that there were about 2 [MASK],@ 000 nationalist fa[MASK]ilies , and practically[MASK]no unionists , on the housing waiting list , and that housing in the nationalist area was crowded and of a very po[MASK]r condition . The South Ward comprised[MASK]the Bogside , Brandywell , Creggan , Bishop Street and Foyle Road , and it[MASK]was this area that would become Free Derry . 
 The Derry Housing Action Committee ([MASK]DHAC ) was formed in March 1968 by members of the Derry Branch of the Northern Ireland Labour Party and the [MASK]ames Connolly Republican Club , i[MASK]cluding Eamonn McCann and Eamon Mela[MASK]gh . It disrupted a meeting of Londonderry Corporation in March 1968 and in [MASK]ay blocked traffic by[MASK]placing a caravan that was home to a family of four in the middle of the Lecky Road in the Bogs[MASK]de a[MASK]d sta[MASK]ing a si[MASK] @-@ down protest at [MASK]he opening of the second deck o[MASK] the Craigavon Bridge . After the meeting of Londonderry Corporation was again disrupted in Augus[MASK] , Eamon Melaugh telep[MASK]oned the Northern Ireland Civil Rights Association ( NICRA ) and invited them to hold a march[MASK]in Derry . The date chosen was 5 October 1968 , an adhoc committee was formed ( although [MASK]n reality most of the organ[MASK]zin[MASK] was done[MASK]by McCann and Melaugh ) and the [MASK]ou[MASK]e w[MASK]s to take the marc[MASK]ers inside the city walls , where nationalis[MASK]s were traditionally not permitted to ma[MASK]ch . The Ministe[MASK] of Home[MASK]Affairs , William [MASK]raig , made an order on 3 October prohibiting the m[MASK]rch on the grounds that the App[MASK]entice Boys of Derry were intending to hold a march on the sa[MASK]e day . In the words of Martin Melaugh of CAIN " this particular tactic ... provided the[MASK]ex[MASK]use[MASK]needed to ban t[MASK]e [MASK]arch . " When the marchers attempted to defy t[MASK]e ban on[MASK]5 October they were stopped by a Royal U[MASK]ster Constabulary ( RUC ) cordon . The police drew their batons and struc[MASK] marchers , including Stormont MP Eddie McAteer[MASK]and Westminster MP Gerry Fitt . Subsequen[MASK]ly the police " broke ranks and used their batons indiscriminately on people in Duke Street " . Marchers trying to esc[MASK]pe met another party of police[MASK][MASK]nd " [MASK]hese police also used their batons indis[MASK]riminately . " Water cannons were also used . The police action caused outrage in the nationalist area of Derry , and at a meeting four[MASK]days later [MASK]he Derry Citizens ' Action Committee ( DCAC ) was formed , with John Hume as c[MASK]air[MASK]an and Ivan Cooper as vice @-@ chairman .

 Another group formed as a result of the even[MASK]s of 5 October was People 's Democracy , a group of students in Queen 's University Belfast [MASK] They organised a march from [MASK]elfast to Derry in support of civil [MASK]ights , starting out with about forty y[MASK]ung pe[MASK]ple on 1 January 1969 . The march met with violent opposition from loyalist[MASK]counter @-@ demonstrators[MASK]at seve[MASK]al points alon[MASK] the route . Finally , at Burntollet Bridge , five miles outside Derry , they were attacked by a mob of about two hundred wielding clubs — som[MASK] of them studded with nails — and stones . Half of the attackers were later identified from press photographs as members of the B @-@ Specials . The police , who were at the sce[MASK]e , c[MASK]atted to the B @-@ Specials as[MASK]they prepared their ambush , and then failed to protect the marchers , many of whom ran into the[MASK]river and were pelted with stones from the bank . Dozens of marchers were take[MASK] to hospital . The remainder continued on to Derry where they wer[MASK] attacked once[MASK]more on thei[MASK] way to Craigavon Bridge before they finally reached Guildhall Square , where [MASK]hey held a rally . [MASK]ioting [MASK]roke out after the rally . Police drove rioters into the Bogside , but did not come after them . In the early hours of the following morning , 5 January , members of the RUC char[MASK]ed into St. Columb 's Wells[MASK]and Lecky Road in the Bogside , breaking wind[MASK]ws and beating res[MASK]dents . In his report on the[MASK]disturbances , Lord Cameron remarked that " for such conduct among members of a disciplined and well @-@ led[MASK]force there c[MASK]n be no acceptable justification or excuse " and added that " its effect in rousing passions and in[MASK]piring hostility towards the police w[MASK]s regrettably great . " 
 [MASK]hat afternoon over 1 @,@ 500 Bogside residents built barricades , armed themselves with steel bars , wooden [MASK]lubs and hurleys , and told the police th[MASK]t they would not be allowed into t[MASK]e area . DCAC chairman John Hume told a meeting of residents that they were to defend the area and no @-@ one was to come in . Groups of men wearing armbands patrolled the [MASK]treets[MASK]in shifts . [MASK]ohn ' Caker ' Casey , a loc[MASK]l activist , painted " You are now entering Free Derry " in white [MASK]aint on the gable [MASK]all of a house on the corner of Lecky Road and Fahan Street . That corner , which was a popular venue for meetings , later became known as " Free Derry Corner " . On 7 January , the barricaded area [MASK]as extended to include the Creggan , another natio[MASK]alist area on a hill overlooking the Bogside . A clandestine radio station calling itself " Radio Free Derry " began broad[MASK]asting to r[MASK]sidents , play[MASK]ng rebel songs[MASK]and encouraging resistance . On[MASK]a small number of occa[MASK]ions law @-@ breakers attempted crimes , but were dealt with by the patrols . Despite all this , the Irish Times reported th[MASK]t " the[MASK]infrastructure of revolutionary control in the area has not[MASK]been developed beyond the maintenance of patrols . " Following some acts of destruction and of violence late in the week , mem[MASK]ers of the DCAC including Ivan Cooper addressed residents on Friday , 10 January and called on them to dismantle the barricades . The barricades were taken down the following morning .

 Over the next three [MASK]onths there were violent clashes , with local youths throwing stones at police . Violence came to a head on Satur[MASK]ay , 19 April after a planned march from Burntollet Bridge to the city centre was banned . A protest in th[MASK] city centre led to clashes with " Paisleyites "[MASK]— un[MASK]onists in sympa[MASK]hy with the anti @-@ civil rights stance of Ian Paisley . Police attempting to drive the protesters back into the [MASK]ogside were themselves driven bac[MASK] to their barracks . A series of pitched [MASK]attles followed , and barricades were built , often under the supervision of Bernadette Devlin , newly elected MP for [MASK]id Ulster . Police pursuing [MASK]ioters broke into a house in William Street a[MASK]d severely beat the occupant , Samuel Devenny , his family and two fr[MASK]ends . Devenny was brought to hospital " bleeding profusely from a number of head wounds . "[MASK]At midnight four hundred RUC men in full riot gear and carrying riot shields occupied the Bogside . Convoys of police vehicles drove through the area with headlights blazing . 
 The following day , several th[MASK]usand[MASK]residents , led by the DCAC , withdrew to the[MASK]Creggan and [MASK]ssued an ultimatum to[MASK]the RUC — withdraw within tw[MASK] hours or[MASK]be [MASK]riv[MASK]n out . With fifte[MASK]n mi[MASK]utes of the two hours remainin[MASK] , the police marched out through the Butcher 's Gate , even as the resid[MASK]nts w[MASK]re entering from the far side . The barricades were not maintained on this occasion , and routine patrols were not prevented . 
 Samuel Devenny s[MASK]ffered a heart attack four days after his beating . On 17 July he suffered a further heart attack and died . Thousands attended his funeral , and the[MASK]mood was sufficiently angry [MASK]hat it was clear the annual App[MASK]entice Boys ' parade , scheduled for 12 August , could not take place without causing serious disturbance .

 The Apprentice [MASK]oys ' para[MASK]e is an annual celebration by unioni[MASK]ts of the relief of the Siege o[MASK] Derry in 1689 , which began when thirteen young apprentice boys shut [MASK]he city 's [MASK]at[MASK]s against the army of King Jam[MASK]s . At that t[MASK]me the parade was held on 12 A[MASK]gust each[MASK]year . Participants from across Northern Ireland and Britain marched along the city walls above the Bogside , and were often openly hostile to the residents . On 30 July 19[MASK]9[MASK]the Derry Citizens Defence Association ( DCDA ) was formed to [MASK]ry to preserve peace during the period of the parade [MASK] and to defen[MASK] the Bogside and Creggan in the event of an attack . The chairman was Seán Keenan , an Irish Republican Ar[MASK]y ( IRA ) veteran ; the vice @-@ cha[MASK]rman was Paddy Doherty , a popular local man sometimes known as " Paddy Bogside " and the secretary w[MASK]s Johnnie Wh[MASK]te , another leading republican and leader of the James Connolly Republican Club . Street committees were formed under t[MASK]e overall command of the DCDA and barricades were built on the nigh[MASK] of 11 August . The parade took place as planned on 12 [MASK]ugust . As it passed through Waterloo Place , on the edge of the Bogside , hostilities began between supporters and opponents of the parade . Fighti[MASK]g between the [MASK]wo groups continued for two hours , then the[MASK]police joined in . They charged up William Street agains[MASK] the Bogsiders , [MASK]ollowed by the ' Paisleyites ' . They were met with a hail of stones a[MASK]d petrol bombs . The en[MASK]uing[MASK][MASK]attle became known as the Battle of the Bogside . Late in the evening , having been driven back repeatedly , the police fired canisters of CS ga[MASK] into t[MASK]e crowd . Youths on the roof of a high @-[MASK] rise[MASK]block of flats on Rossville Street threw petrol[MASK]bombs down on the police . Walkie @-@ talkies were used to maintain contact between different areas of fighting and DCDA head[MASK]uarters in [MASK]a[MASK]dy Doherty 's house in Westland Street , and firs[MASK] [MASK]id stations we[MASK]e [MASK]perating , staffed by doctors , nurses and volunteers . Women and [MASK]irls ma[MASK]e milk @-@ bottle crates of petr[MASK]l bombs for suppl[MASK] to the youths in the front line [MASK]nd [MASK] Radio Free Derry " broadcast to the fi[MASK]hters and their families . On the third day of fighting , 14 August , the Northern Ireland Government mobilised the Ul[MASK]ter Special Constabulary ( B @-@ Specials ) , a force greatly feared by nationalists in Derry and elsewhere . Before they [MASK]ngaged , however , British [MASK]roops were deployed at the scene , carrying automatic rifles and sub @[MASK][MASK] machine guns . The RUC and B @-@ Spec[MASK]als withdrew , and the troops to[MASK]k up positio[MASK]s outside the barricaded area . 
 A deputation that included Eamonn McCann met senior army officers and told them [MASK]hat the army woul[MASK] not be allowed in until certain demands were m[MASK]t [MASK] including the disarming[MASK]of the RUC , the disbandment of the B @-@ Specials and the abo[MASK]ition of Storm[MASK]nt ( the Parliament and G[MASK]vernment of Northern Ireland ) . The officers agreed that neither troops nor police would enter the Bogside and Creggan districts . A ' peace corps ' was formed to maintain law and order [MASK] Wh[MASK]n the British Home Secretary , Jim Callaghan , visited [MASK]orthern Ireland and announced his intention to visit the Bogside on 28 August , he was told that he would [MASK]ot be allowed to bring e[MASK]ther police or soldiers [MASK]ith him . Callaghan [MASK]greed . Accomp[MASK]nied b[MASK] members of the Defence Committee , he was " swept along by a sur[MASK]ing cr[MASK]wd of[MASK]tho[MASK]sands " up Rossvile Street and into Lecky Road , wher[MASK] he " took refuge " in a local house[MASK], and later addre[MASK]sed c[MASK]owds from an upstair[MASK] window . In [MASK]reparation for Callaghan 's visit the " Fr[MASK]e Derry " wall was painted white[MASK]and the " You are now entering Free Derry " sig[MASK] w[MASK]s professi[MASK]nally re @-@ painted in black lettering[MASK]. 
 Following Callaghan 's visit , some barricades were breached , but[MASK]the majority remained while the people awaited concrete e[MASK]idenc[MASK] of reform . Still the army made no move to enter the area . Law and order was maintained by a ' peace corp[MASK] ' — volunteers organised by the DCDA to patrol [MASK]he streets and man the barricades . There was very little crime . Punishment ,[MASK]in the words of Eamonn[MASK]McCan[MASK] , " as often as not consisted of a [MASK]tern lecture[MASK]from [MASK]eán Keenan o[MASK] the need for s[MASK]lidarity within the area . " In September the barricades were replaced with a white line painted on the road . 
 The [MASK]unt Report on the future of policing in Northern Ire[MASK]and was presented to the Storm[MASK]nt cabinet in early October .[MASK]Jim Callaghan held talks with the cabinet in Belfast on 10 October , following which the report 's [MASK]ecommendations were accepted and made publ[MASK]c . They included the recommendation that the RUC should be ' ordinarily ' unarmed , and that the[MASK]B @-@ Specials should be phased out and replaced by a new force . The new RUC Chief Constabl[MASK] , Arthur Y[MASK]ung , an Englishman , was announced , and travelled to Belfast with Callag[MASK]an . The same day , Seán Keenan announced that the DCDA was to be [MASK]issolved . On [MASK]1 October Callaghan and Y[MASK]ung visited Free Derry , and on 12 October the first military police entered the Bogside , on foot and unarmed [MASK]

 The Irish Republican Army ( IRA[MASK]) had been i[MASK]active militarily since [MASK]he end [MASK]f the Border Cam[MASK]aign in 1962 . It was low in both personnel and equipment — Chief of Staff Cathal Goulding told Seán Keenan and Paddy Doherty in August 1969 that he " couldn 't defend the Bogsid[MASK] . I haven 't the me[MASK] nor the guns to do it . " Duri[MASK]g the 1960s the leadership of the republican movement had moved to the left . Its focus was on cla[MASK]s struggle and its aim was [MASK]o unite the Irish nationalist and unionist working classes in order to overthrow capitalism , both British and Irish . Republican Clubs were formed in Northern Ireland , where Si[MASK]n [MASK]éin was proscribed . These clubs were involved in the formation of NICRA in 1967 . In Derry , the James Connolly Repu[MASK]lican Club worke[MASK] closely with Labou[MASK] Party radi[MASK]als , with whom they set up the Derry Housing Action Committee and Derry Unemploye[MASK] Action Committee . T[MASK]e Derry Citizens ' Defence Association was formed initially by republicans , who then inv[MASK]ted other nationalis[MASK]s to join . Although there were tensions between the younger leaders like Johnnie White and the older , traditional republicans such as Seán Keenan , both sides saw the unrest of 1968 @-@ 69 as a chance to advance[MASK]republican aims , and the two shared the platform at the Easter Rising commemoration in April [MASK]969 . 
 The events of August 1969 in Derry ,[MASK]and more particularly[MASK][MASK]n Belfast where the IRA was unable to prevent loss of li[MASK]e or protect families bu[MASK]ned out of their homes , brought to a head the[MASK]divisions that had already appeared within the moveme[MASK][MASK] between the radicals and the traditionalists , and [MASK]ed to a split in December 1969 into the Official I[MASK]A and[MASK]the Provisional IRA . Initially , both armies organised for de[MASK]ensive purposes only , although the Provisionals were planning towards an offensive campaign . In Derry there was far less hostility between t[MASK]e two organisations than elsewhere and householders commonly paid subscriptions to both . When rioters were arrested after the Official 's Ea[MASK]ter parade in Ma[MASK]ch 1970 , Offic[MASK]als and [MASK]rovisionals pic[MASK]eted their trial together . At the start the Officials attracted most of the younger members . Martin McGuinness , who in Augu[MASK]t 1969 had helped defend the barricades , initially joined the Officials , but a few months later left to join the Provisionals . 
 Relat[MASK]ons between the British Ar[MASK]y and the residents had steadily decayed since the first appearance of troops in August 1969 . I[MASK] September , after clashes between nati[MASK]nalist and unionist crowds that led to the death of a Protestant man , William King , the British Army erected a ' peace r[MASK]ng ' to enclose the nationalist populatio[MASK] in the area they had previously c[MASK]ntrolled . Roads into the city centre were closed at night and people were prevented from[MASK]walking on certain street[MASK] . Alth[MASK]ugh some[MASK]moderate nationalists acce[MASK]ted this as necessary , there was[MASK]anger among young people . Clashes between youths and troops became more frequent . The riot following the Officials ' Eas[MASK]er parade in March 197[MASK] marked the first time that the [MASK]rmy used ' snatch squads ' , who rushed into the Bo[MASK]side wielding batons to make arrests . The snatch squads soon became a common feature of army arrest operations . There was also a belief that they were arresting people at random , sometimes days after the alleged offence , [MASK]nd based on the identification of people that they had seen f[MASK]om a consid[MASK]rable distanc[MASK] . The rioters were [MASK]ondemned as hooligans by modera[MASK]es , who saw the riots as hampering attempts to resolve the situation . Th[MASK] Labour radicals and Official republicans , sti[MASK]l working together , tried to tu[MASK][MASK] the y[MASK]uth awa[MASK] from rioting and create socialist organizations[MASK]— one such organization was named the Young Hooligans Association — but to no avail . The Provisiona[MASK]s ,[MASK]while disapproving of riots , viewed them as the inevitable cons[MASK]quence of British occupation [MASK] This philosophy was more attractive to rioters , and some of them joined the Provisional IRA . The deaths of two leading Provisionals in a premature explosion [MASK]n June 1970 resulted in young militants becoming more prominent in the organizat[MASK]on . Nevertheless , up to July 1971[MASK]the Provisional IRA remained numerically sm[MASK]ll . 
 Two men , Séamas Cusack and Desmond Beattie , were shot dead in separate incidents in the early mor[MASK]ing and afternoon of 8 July 1971 [MASK] They w[MASK]re the fi[MASK]st people to be killed by the British Army in Derry . In both cases the British Army cla[MASK]med that the men were attackin[MASK] them with guns or bombs , while eyewitnesses insisted th[MASK]t both were unarmed . The Social Democratic and Labour Party ( SDLP ) , the[MASK]newly formed party of which John Hume and Ivan Cooper were leading members , withdrew from Stormont in protest , but among residents there was a[MASK]perception that moderate policie[MASK] had failed . The res[MASK]lt was a surge of support for the IRA . The Provi[MASK]ionals held a meeting the following Sunday at which they c[MASK]lled on people to " join the IRA " . Following the meeting , people queued up to join , and[MASK]there was large @-@ scale rioting . The British Army post at Bligh 's Lane came under sustained attack , and troops there and around the city came under fire from the IRA .

 [MASK]he increasing violence in Derry and elsewhere led to increasing s[MASK]eculation that in[MASK]ernment without trial would be introduced in Northern Ireland , and [MASK]n 9 August 1971 hundreds of republicans and nationalists were arrested in dawn raids . In D[MASK]rry , residents came out onto the streets to resist the arre[MASK]ts , [MASK]nd fewer people were taken there than elsewh[MASK]re ; nevertheless leading figures including Seán Keenan and John[MASK]ie White were interned . In response , barricades were erecte[MASK] once again and the third Free Derry came into existence . Unlike its predecessors , this Free Derry was marked by a s[MASK]ro[MASK]g IRA presence , both Official and Provis[MASK]onal . It was defended [MASK]y armed paramilitaries — a no @-@ go area , one in which British [MASK]ecurity forces were unable to operate . 
 G[MASK]n attacks on the British Army increased . Six soldiers were wounded in the first day after [MASK]nternment , and shortly afterwards a soldier was killed — the first [MASK]o be killed by either IRA in Derry . The army moved in in force on 18 August to dismantle the barricades . [MASK] gun battle ensued in which a young Provisional IRA officer , Eamonn Laf[MASK]er[MASK]y ,[MASK]was killed . A crowd staging a sit @-@ d[MASK]wn protest was hosed down and the protesters , including John Hume[MASK]and Ivan Cooper , arrested . With barricades re @-@ appearing as quickly as they were removed , the army eventually abandoned their attempt . 
 The Derry Provi[MASK]ionals had littl[MASK] contact with the IRA elsewhere . They had few weapons ( about twenty ) which they u[MASK][MASK]d mainly for sni[MASK]ing . At the same time , they launched their b[MASK]mbing campaign in Derry . Unlike in Belfast , the[MASK] [MASK]er[MASK] careful to avoid k[MASK]lling or injuring innocent people . Eamonn McCann wr[MASK]te [MASK]hat " the Derry Provos , under Marti[MASK] McGuinness , had managed to bomb the city centre until it looked as if it had been hit from the air without causing any civilian casualtie[MASK] . " 
 Although both IRAs op[MASK]rated openly , neither was [MASK]n control of Free Derry . The barricades were manned by unarmed ' au[MASK]iliaries ' .[MASK]Crime[MASK]was dealt with by a [MASK]o[MASK]unteer force called the Free Derry Police , which was headed by Tony O 'Doher[MASK]y , a Derry [MASK]ootballer and Northern Ireland I[MASK]ternational .

 An anti @-@ internment protest organised by the Northern Ireland Civil Rights Association ( NICRA ) at Magilligan Camp in January 1972 was met with [MASK]iolence from the 1st Battalion , The Parachute Regiment ( 1 Pa[MASK]a ) . NICRA ha[MASK] organ[MASK]sed [MASK] march fro[MASK] the Creggan to Derry city centre , in defiance of a ba[MASK] , on the following Sun[MASK]ay , 30 January [MASK]972 .[MASK]Both IRAs were asked , and agreed , to suspend operations on that da[MASK] to ensure the march passed o[MASK]f peacefully . The British Army erected barricades around the Free Derry area to prevent marchers f[MASK]om reaching the city centre . On the day , march organisers turned the march away [MASK]rom the barriers and[MASK]up to Free Derry Corner , but [MASK]ome youths pr[MASK]ceeded to the barrier at William Street[MASK]an[MASK] sto[MASK]ed soldiers . Troops from 1 Para then moved i[MASK]to Free Derry and opened fire , killing thirteen people , all [MASK]f whom were sub[MASK]equently found to be un[MASK]rmed . A fourteenth shooting victim died four months later in J[MASK]ne 1972 . Like the killing of Cusack and Beattie the previous year , Bloody Sunday had the effect o[MASK] hu[MASK]ely increasing recruitment to the IRA , even among people who previously would have been ' moderates ' .

 Both the Provisional and Official IRA stepped up attacks after Bloo[MASK]y Sunday , with the tacit support of the residents . Local f[MASK]elings[MASK]changed , however , with the killing of Ranger William Best by th[MASK] Official IRA . Best was a 19 @-@ yea[MASK] @-@ old local man who was home on l[MASK]ave from the British Army at his parents ' house in the Creggan . He was [MASK]bducted , interrogated and [MASK]hot . The fol[MASK]owing day 500 women marched to the Republican Club offices in protes[MASK] . Nine days later , on 29 May , the Official IRA declared[MASK]a ceasefire . The Provisional IRA initially stated that they would not follow suit , but after informal approaches to the British G[MASK]vernment they announced a ceasefire from 26 June . [MASK]artin McGuinness was the Derry representative in a party of [MASK]enior Pro[MASK]isionals who travelled to London for talks with William Whitelaw , the[MASK]Secretary of[MASK]State for Northern Ireland . The talks were not r[MASK]sumed after the ending of the truce following a violent confrontation in Belfast when troops p[MASK]evented Catholic families from taking over houses in [MASK]he Lenadoon estate . 
 Political pressure for the action against the " no @-@ go "[MASK]areas increased after the events of Bloody Friday in Belfast . A British Army attack was considered inevitable , and the IRA took the decision[MASK]no[MASK] to resist it . On 31 July 1972 , Operation Motorman was launched when t[MASK]ousands of British troops , equi[MASK]ped wi[MASK]h armoured cars and armoured bulldozers ( AVREs ) , dismantled the barricad[MASK]s and occupi[MASK]d the area . 
 
 = = Subsequent history = = 
 
 After Opera[MASK]ion Motorman , the British Army controlled the Bo[MASK]side and Cregg[MASK]n by stationing large numbers of troops within the area , by cond[MASK]cting large @-@ scale ' search ' opera[MASK]ions that were in fa[MASK]t undertaken for purposes of intelligence gathering , and by setting up over a dozen covert observation posts . Over the following years IRA violence in the city was contained to t[MASK]e point where it was possible to believe ' the war was over ' in the area , although there were still frequent street riots . Nationalists — even those who did not support the IRA — [MASK]emained bitterly opposed to the army and to the state . 
 Many of the residents [MASK] original grievances were addressed with the passing of the Local Government ( Northern Ireland ) Act , 1972 , which redrew the ele[MASK]toral boundaries and introduced universal adult suffrage based on the single transferable vote . Elections were held in May 1973 . Nationalists gained a majority [MASK]n the council for the first t[MASK]me since[MASK]1[MASK]23 . Since then the area has[MASK]been exte[MASK]sively redevelope[MASK] , with modern housing[MASK]replacing the old houses and flats . The Free Derry era is commemorated by the Free Derry wall , the murals of the Bogside Artists and the Museum of Free Derry .

 Come What ( ever ) May is the [MASK]econd studio album by American alternative metal ba[MASK]d Stone Sour . It was recorded and produced by the band and Nick Raskulinecz at Studio 606 in Los Angeles , Ca[MASK]ifornia , and was release[MASK] on August 1 , 2006 , through Roadrunner Records . Writing for the album beg[MASK]n as [MASK]arly a[MASK] 2003 when vocalist Corey Taylor and guitarist James Root we[MASK]e writing material for their other band , Slipknot . In January 2006 Stone Sour began recording the follow @-@ up to their 2002 deb[MASK]t album Stone Sour , during which [MASK]ime drummer Joe[MASK] Ekman left the band due to family constraints . He was eventually replaced by ex @-@ Soulfly drummer Roy Mayorga who played on all but two tracks on the album . 
 Following the release of the[MASK]album , Stone Sour went on to [MASK]romote it for over a year ; re[MASK]easing five singles and touring in several regions , [MASK]ncluding the United States , Canada , Japan and severa[MASK] countries in Europe . The album received generally positive reviews . It was praised for showing a progression in the band 's song writing abil[MASK]ty and musical style . It was also certified Gold in the United[MASK]States and Canada and the single " 30 / 30 @-@ 150 " was nominated for Best Metal [MASK]erformance at the 49th Gram[MASK]y Awards . On June 26 , 2007 Stone Sour re[MASK]eased a special edi[MASK]ion versio[MASK] of the album , it included six previously unreleased tracks and a bonus DVD which featured three music videos and a complet[MASK] live perfor[MASK]ance of the band in Moscow . It remains their best @-@ selling album to date , mostly due to the success of the single " Th[MASK]ough Glass . "

 In September 2005 , lead [MASK][MASK]nger Corey Taylor announced that [MASK]tone Sour would return w[MASK]th a second album . He said that they had written over 30 songs , some during the writing process of Vol . 3 : ( The Subliminal Verses ) , the third album by vocalist Taylor and guitarist James Root 's other band S[MASK]ipknot , and that they were working on dem[MASK]ing the tracks before entering the studio . Dave Fortman[MASK]was originally slated to produce the album , however , on January 22[MASK], 2006 Stone Sour began working on the album with producer Nick Rasku[MASK]inecz at Dave Grohl 's [MASK]ersonal studi[MASK] ( Studio 606 ) ,[MASK]in Lo[MASK] Angeles . Time in the studio began with a week of pre @-@ production ,[MASK]during which guitarist J[MASK]sh[MASK]Rand says producer Raskulinecz " pu[MASK]hed [MASK] the [MASK]and ] to the brink and back " to help fine @-@ tune t[MASK]e songs they had previously written . Though Rand and Taylor wrote most of the music and lyrics for the first album , respectively , writing for C[MASK]me What ( ever ) M[MASK]y was done by all [MASK]embers[MASK]. 
 Following this , the band set out to record 18 tracks and work began on record[MASK]ng Joel E[MASK]man 's d[MASK]um tracks . However , Ekman was forced to l[MASK]ave[MASK]the studio after four wee[MASK]s due to his young son 's diagnosis[MASK]of a brainstem glioma . With the fate of the album in jeopard[MASK] , Stone Sour recruited ex @-@ Soulfly member Roy Mayorga as a session drummer . Mayorg[MASK] recorded drum[MASK] for all[MASK]but two tracks on the album , Godsmack drummer Shannon Larkin performed on the track " 3[MASK] / 30[MASK]@-@ 150 " and guita[MASK]ist Root perform[MASK]d drums on the bonus track " The Day I[MASK]Let Go . " In an interview with[MASK]Revolver during the [MASK]ecording process vocalist Taylor talked about the differ[MASK]nces between this album and their previous album , Stone Sour . He said that[MASK]pressures from fans and the record label were much larger ; also noting that he " thrives on the pressure , because it gets [ him ] going . " While promising that " the album 's go[MASK]na be miles above the first one , " Taylor explained tha[MASK] it is[MASK]" more melodic and darker " . I[MASK] late March 2006 , dr[MASK]mm[MASK]r Joel Ekman officially left Stone Sour and the band was talking with a few drummers who could replac[MASK] him . On April 7 , 2006[MASK]the recording sessio[MASK]s for Come What ( ever ) May concluded . A month later session drummer Roy Mayorga joined Stone Sour [MASK]n a full @-[MASK] time basis .

 In an intervi[MASK]w with MTV in 2006 ,[MASK]voca[MASK]ist Corey Taylor [MASK]aid that Come [MASK]hat ( ever ) May was a return to the roots of t[MASK]e ba[MASK]d , stating it is " a lot more from the spirit of what the band started with in 1992 .

 Come What ( ever[MASK]) May was met with generally positive critical reviews . Several reviewers noted on how it helped to further establish Stone Sour . Chad Bower of About.com stated that the band had " progressed a lot since their debut " , noting that the album[MASK]was " very diverse and [ allows ] the band to show many different sides of their musical perso[MASK]ality . "[MASK]Megan Frye of Allmusic[MASK]opens her review[MASK]of the album by distinguishing what sets Stone Sour apart musically , stating " [ it 's their ] ability to create smooth , r[MASK]dio @-@ fr[MASK]endly altern[MASK]t[MASK]ve metal [MASK]ongs while simultaneously not boring the people who have heard way too much from [MASK]ost @-@ grun[MASK]e groups . " On a similar note , Michael Melchor of 411man[MASK]a said " the band is mu[MASK]h better at the craft of songwritin[MASK] than many of their peers . " However , in contrast , reviewer William Fry of IGN criticized the[MASK]album , saying " Stone Sour do[MASK]sn 't do anything inspired , origi[MASK]al , or fresh here " even calli[MASK]g the album " [MASK]ompletely misdirected , and stonewalled . " A particular point of interest f[MASK]r reviewers was how Come What ( ever ) May is more mel[MASK]dic than their previous album Stone Sour [MASK] Melchor of 411mania said the album [MASK]s " much more liberal with the balladry and acoustic sound[MASK] than its predeces[MASK]or[MASK], " noting on the track "[MASK]Sillyworld " he said " it sounds like what Nickelback could be if Chad Kroeger could write a [MASK]ood melody " . In his review , Chad Bower labeled Come What ( ever ) May as a " ve[MASK]y melodic and accessible album " [MASK]tating that " it has a little something for everyone . " Simila[MASK]ly , Megan Frye triumphed the album as an " unyielding effort from a promising talent " . 
 Come What ( ever )[MASK]May sold over 80[MASK]@,@ 000 copies in its first week and debuted at the fourth spot on the[MASK]Billboard 200 in the United States , and went on to be certified gold i[MASK] the UK , Canada and the United States .

The appearance of this delegation marked the tenth appearance of Chad [MASK]t the Summer Olympics , the first [MASK]een in [MASK]964 Summer Olympi[MASK]s in Tokyo , Japan , and its seventh appearance since i[MASK]s Olympic hiatus between 1976 and 1980 . Both Sébergué and Ndikert ranked seventh in their respective heats and did not advance past the qualification round . As of the end of the 2012 London Olympics[MASK], there have been no m[MASK]dalists from Chad .

 Chad is a landlocked country in Africa whose northern region lies within the east[MASK]rn reaches of the Sahara Desert and whose southern region l[MASK]es within the eastern portion of the Sahel . It[MASK]borders Libya to the s[MASK]uth , Niger to the east , Sudan to t[MASK]e west[MASK], and the Central African Republic to the north . Chad was origi[MASK]ally part of French Wes[MASK] Africa until 1960 , w[MASK]en it declared independence . Some four years later , the former French colony made its débu[MASK] at the 1964 Summer Olympics in Tokyo , Japan . For the next th[MASK]ee decades , Chad became embroiled in[MASK]civil war and experienced invasions by Libya and upheavals by Sudanese @-@ backed rebels ; the civil war ended [MASK]n 1990 , although rebel threats had persisted[MASK]between then and 2008 . During Chad 's greatest era of instability , athletes from the country [MASK]id not att[MASK]nd the 1976 Summer Olympics in Montréal , Canada or the 1980 Summer Olympics in Moscow , USSR , although delegations were sent to all other games betwe[MASK]n 1964 and 2008 . 
 The largest Chadian delegation to reach the Olympics appeared in the 1988 Summer Olympics in Seoul , South Korea and at the 1992 Summer Olympics in Barcelona , Spain ; each time , Chad 's [MASK]ational Olym[MASK]ic Committee sent six at[MASK]letes . D[MASK]ri[MASK]g the 1992 gam[MASK]s , the NOC sent the nation 's first female Olympia[MASK] . Since then ( and up to the Beijing games ) , at least one woman has b[MASK]en a part o[MASK] the Chadian delegation . The smallest contingency of Chadian [MASK]lympian[MASK] occurred during [MASK]he 2004 Summer Olympics in Athe[MASK]s , Greece , when only Kaltouma Nadjina competed on the country 's beha[MASK]f . The delegation that arrived in Beijing consisted of two athletes — one [MASK]an ( 30 @-@ year @-@ old Moumi Sébergué ) and one woman ( 15 @-@ year @-@ old Hinikissia Albertine Ndikert ) , both p[MASK][MASK]ticipants in track events . Ndikert was Chad 's fl[MASK]gbearer at the ceremonies . Up [MASK]o [MASK]nd including the Beijing games , there has y[MASK]t[MASK]to have been a medalist from Chad .

 Moumi [MASK]ébergu[MASK] represented Chad at the Beijing Olym[MASK]i[MASK]s in the men 's 100 meters dash . Born in 1977 , Sébergué first participated in the Olympics at [MASK]ge 22 when he raced in th[MASK] men 's 100 meters at the 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney , Australia , placing seventh in his qualification hea[MASK] and not progressing to later rounds . He did not attend the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens , Greece , but returned to the Olympics at [MASK]eijing at the age of 30 . Durin[MASK] th[MASK] course of the August 14 , 2008 races in his event , when the qualification round t[MASK]ok place , Sébergué competed i[MASK] the tenth[MASK]heat against seven other[MASK]athletes .

 View of the World from 9th Avenue ( s[MASK]metimes A Parochial New Yorker 's View of the World , A New Yorker 's View of the World or simply View of the World[MASK]) is a 1976 illustra[MASK]i[MASK]n by Saul Steinberg that[MASK]served as the cov[MASK]r of the[MASK]March 29 , 1976 , edition of The New Yorker .[MASK]The work presents the view from Manhattan of the rest of the world showing Manhattan as the[MASK]center of the world . 
 View of the World has been parodied b[MASK] Ted Rall , Columbia Pictures , The New Yorker , The [MASK]conomist and Mad Magaz[MASK]ne , [MASK]mong others . The work has been imitated and printed without author[MASK]zation in a variety of ways . The Columbi[MASK] parody led to a ruling by the United States District Court for the Southern District of New Yor[MASK] in Steinberg v.

 S[MASK]ul Steinberg created 85 covers and 642 internal drawings and ill[MASK]strations for The New Yorker ,[MASK][MASK]nclud[MASK]ng its March 29 , 1976 cover , titled " View of the World from 9th Avenue " . This is [MASK]egarded as his most famous work . It is cons[MASK]dered an exam[MASK]le of unintentional fame : Steinberg has noted that the type of fame that [MASK]esu[MASK]ted from the work has diminished his significance to " the man who did that poster " . The [MASK]ork is s[MASK]metimes referred to as A Parochial New Yorker 's View of the [MASK]orld or A New Yorker 's View of the World because it depicts a map of the world as seen by self @-@ absorbed New Yorkers . At one point The New Yorker applied for a copyright from the United States Copyright Office for the work . I[MASK] assigned the copyright to Steinberg and subsequently reproduced posters of the painting .

[MASK]The illustration is split in two p[MASK]rts , with the bottom half of the image showin[MASK] Manhattan 's 9th Avenue , 10th Avenue , and the Hudson River ( appropriately labeled ) , and the top half depicting the rest of the world . It is a w[MASK]stward view over 10th Avenue . The rest of the United States is[MASK]the size of the three New York City b[MASK]ocks and is drawn as a rectangle bounded by North American neighbors Canada and Mexico , with a thin brown strip along the Hudson repr[MASK]senting " Jersey " , the names of five cities ( Los Angeles ; Washington , D.C. ; Las Vegas ; Kansas City ; and Chicago ) and three states ( Tex[MASK]s [MASK] Utah , and Nebraska ) [MASK]cat[MASK]ered among a few rocks for the United States beyond New Jersey[MASK], which is in bolder font than the rest of the country beyond the Hudson . Washington , D.[MASK][MASK] is depicted as a remote location near Mexico . The Pacific Ocean , slightly wider [MASK]han the [MASK]udson , separates the United States from three flattened land masses labeled China , Japan and Russia . Notably , the image depicts the world with a back turn[MASK]d to Europe , which is absent from t[MASK]e painting . 
 The work is composed in ink , pencil , colored pencil , and watercolor on paper and measures 28 by 19 inc[MASK]es ( 71 cm × 48 cm ) . When exhibiting this work along with alternate versions and sketches , the Univers[MASK]ty of Pennsylvania summarized the [MASK]ork as a " bird 's @-@ eye view of [MASK]he [MASK]ity from Ninth Avenue in a s[MASK]raight line westward [MASK] with space becoming ever [MASK]ore condensed ...[MASK]" Th[MASK]y also described th[MASK] [MASK]ork as a t[MASK]ngue @-@ [MASK]n @-@ cheek view of the wor[MASK]d . New York in[MASK]erpreted the New York [MASK]-@ centric mind 's view of the res[MASK] of the world as[MASK]a set of outer boroughs as [MASK]conic . National Post journalist Robert Fulford descr[MASK]bed the perspective as one in which the entire world is a suburb of Manhattan .

 View of the World has been imitated without authorization in a variety of ways . The[MASK]work has been imitated in postcard format by numerous municipalitie[MASK] , states and nations . Stein[MASK]er[MASK] had stated that he could have retired on royaltie[MASK] from the many parodies made of the painting , had they been[MASK]paid , a motiv[MASK]tion for his eventual copyright lawsuit for the[MASK]Moscow on the Hudson use . Fulford , writing in The National Post , noted that the metaphor [MASK]f the world as a sub[MASK]rb of Manhattan was " understood and borrowed " by the who[MASK]e world . Local artis[MASK]s , especially poster artists , presented similarly [MASK]ompelling depictions of their own provincial perceptions . Fulford demonstrated the prominence of this work by mentioning that a high school in suburban Ottawa made imitating View of the World an assignment in its graphic arts[MASK]class . He also noted that the results of this assignment was a wo[MASK]ldwide variety of [MASK]lobal foci from which the students viewed the world .

 On June 5 , 2003 , during the first term of George W. Bush 's presidency , Ted Rall presented A View of the World [MASK]rom Pennsylvania[MASK]Avenue as a Parody of View of the World from 9th Avenue in a Universal Press [MASK]yndicate editorial cartoon . He replaced the letters representing The New [MASK]orker with The Bushie . 
 The cover was later sati[MASK]ized by Bar[MASK]y Blitt for the cove[MASK] of The [MASK]ew Yorker[MASK]on October 6 , 2008 . The cover featured Sara[MASK] Palin loo[MASK]ing out of her window [MASK]eeing[MASK]only Alaska , with Russia in the far background .

 Bintulu / biːnˈtu[MASK]luː / ( Chinese : [MASK]都魯 ; pinyin : Míndū[MASK]ǔ ; Pe ̍ h @-@ ōe @-[MASK] jī : Bîn @-@ to ͘[MASK]-ló ͘ ) is a coastal town on the island of[MASK][MASK]orneo [MASK]n the centra[MASK] region of Sarawak , Malaysia . Bintulu is located 610 kilometres ( 380 mi ) nor[MASK]heast of Kuching [MASK] 216 kilometres ( 134 mi ) northeast of Sibu , and 200 kilome[MASK]res [MASK] 120 mi ) southwest of Mir[MASK] . With a population of 1[MASK]4 [MASK],@ 058 as of 2010 , Bintulu is the capital of the Bintulu District of the Bi[MASK]tulu[MASK]Division of Sarawak , Malaysia . 
 The n[MASK]me of Bintulu was derived from the local native language " Mentu Ulau " ( picking heads ) . Bintulu[MASK]was a small fishing village when Rajah James Bro[MASK]ke a[MASK]quired it in 186[MASK] . Brooke later built a fort ther[MASK] in 1862 . In 1867 , the f[MASK]rst General Council meeting ( now Sarawak State Legislative Assembly ) was convened in Bin[MASK]ulu . It is the earliest state legislature [MASK]ystem in Malaysia . The construction of the earliest airstrip in Bintulu began in 1934 but was halted in 1938 due to financial diffi[MASK]ulties . During World War II , t[MASK]e airstrip was heavily bombed by Allied forces . The Briti[MASK]h later rebuilt the airstrip , and it became [MASK]ully operational in 1955 . The old airport was replaced by a new airport in[MASK]2002 . Bintu[MASK]u remained a fishing village until 1969 when oil and gas reserves were discovered off the coast . Since then ,[MASK]Bintulu has become the centre of energy int[MASK]nsive i[MASK]dustries such as a Malaysia LNG plant , a[MASK]Shell Middle Distillate Synth[MASK]sis plant , and a Bintulu combined cycle power plant . The economy has also expanded into oil palm and forest plan[MASK]ations , palm[MASK]oil processing , wood @-@ waste processing , and cemen[MASK] manufacturing . The [MASK]ort of Bintulu is[MASK]the busiest in Sarawak . The town is also a gateway to Samalajau Industrial Park . 
 Among th[MASK] tourist attractions in Bintulu are Similajau National Park , Tumbina Par[MASK] , Tanjung Batu beach , Jepak village , Kuan[MASK]Yin Tong temple , Assyakirin[MASK]m[MASK][MASK]que , Council Negri monument , Tamu Bintulu , and Pasar Utama markets . The Borneo International[MASK]Kite Festival is held annu[MASK]lly i[MASK] the town .

 = = Etymology = = 
 
 During the 16th cen[MASK]ury , Bintulu was named " River de Burulu [MASK] by Portuguese cartographers . There are several legends surroundi[MASK]g the name Bi[MASK]tulu . During the Brooke [MASK]ynasty , the indigenous Iban people practised headhunting to maintain their social status in the community . They threw the heads into the Kemena River , after which the heads had to be collected from the river . The prac[MASK]ice of collecting the heads was known as [MASK] Mentu Ulau " ( picking heads ) in the local native language . A[MASK]other st[MASK]ry relates that [MASK]wo Iban warriors named Bernik and Jelab built houses along the river . They and their followers frequently carried out preservati[MASK]n of severed heads near a small river stream bra[MASK]ching off from Sebezaw River because the riv[MASK]r bank was flat and wide . Therefore , the[MASK]small river stream was named " Mentu Ulau " riv[MASK]r . Outsiders who came to Bintulu subsequently pro[MASK]ounced the name as " Mentulau " , and later the name evolved into " Bent[MASK]lu " and , finally , " Bi[MASK]tulu " .

 James B[MASK]ooke was appointed the White Rajah of Sarawak ( now known as[MASK]Kuching ) by the Bruneian Empire in 184[MASK] . In 1861 , the Sultanate of Brunei ceded the Bintulu region to Broo[MASK]e . Bintulu was a small settlement at that time . A wooden fort named Fort Keppel was built in the village [MASK] [MASK]amed after Sir Henry Keppel , w[MASK]o was a close friend of th[MASK] Rajah James and Charles Brooke . Sir Henry Keppel was responsible for crushing the Dayak piracy in the Saribas between 1840 and[MASK]1850 . Meanwhile , Charles Bro[MASK]ke was a nephew of James Brooke and would later become the latt[MASK]r 's successor as the second Rajah of Sarawak . Odoardo Beccari , an Italian botanist , visited Bintulu in 1867 . On 4 August , he started his journey on a gunboat named [MASK] Heartsea[MASK]e " , which was to send $ 6 @,@ 000 to Brunei for concessions being made [MASK]o James Brooke in the Mukah[MASK]and Bintu[MASK]u regions . He went t[MASK] Labuan before coming back to Bintulu . He dropped off at Kemena River o[MASK] 13 August 1867 . His ob[MASK]ervations of the villa[MASK]e were recorded as follows : 
 The fort o[MASK] Bintu[MASK][MASK] which was built ent[MASK]rely of wood , was in somewh[MASK]t ruinous con[MASK]ition . It stood nearly on the sea @-@[MASK]shore , and just behind it , at a distance of few paces , the p[MASK]imeval for[MASK]sts commenced ... Some chinamen had [MASK]ettled at the vicinit[MASK] of the fort and had built [MASK] small bazaar ; but the village is [MASK]hiefly formed by the houses of the Melana[MASK] beyond the Chinese kampong ( village ) . These Melanaus used to live further u[MASK] the river , but since the constru[MASK]tion of the fort , and the installation of an officer of[MASK]the Rajah near the mouth of the river , they came to settle near the sea – a thing they would never have dared to do in former days for fear of the attacks of the Lanun[MASK]pirates and Dayak pirates . 
 The houses of the Melanau people were built in ro[MASK]s on b[MASK]th sides of the Kemena River , mostly furnished by Nipah and Sago palms . Each house had its own shed projection into t[MASK]e entrance of the river , which was used for the processing of Sago palms . On 8 Septem[MASK]er 1867 , the first Sarawak General Council meeting ( now Sarawak State Legislative Assembly ) took place here . It was m[MASK]de up of 21 elected local community members ( five [MASK]ritish officers and 16 [MASK]ala[MASK] and Melanau local chiefs ) . The Council was formed by Raja Muda Charles Brooke under orders from Rajah James Brooke . The Council is the oldest state legisl[MASK]tive assembly in Malaysia .

 During World War II , Rajah Charles Vyne[MASK] Brooke ordered the construction of airstrips in Kuc[MASK]ing , Oya , Mu[MASK]ah , Bintulu , and Miri . Construction of the Bintulu airstrip was started in 1934 under the direction of C. W.[MASK]Bailey , a Wor[MASK]s and Building Inspecto[MASK] for the British Royal Air Force ( RAF ) . All the a[MASK]rstrips were completed except for th[MASK] Bintulu airstrip , where construction was discontinued in October 1938 due to financial reasons . Japanese forces landed in Miri on 16 December 1941 . Sarawak fell into Japanese hands when they conquered Kuching on 24 December 1941 .[MASK]When the Japanese[MASK]invaded Sarawak , Charles Vyner Brooke a[MASK]ready left for Sydney ( Australia ) before the attack while his officers were captured by the Japanese and interned at the Batu Lintang camp . During the Japanese occupation , the Japanese used the airstrip for military purposes . However , the airstrip was heavily bombed[MASK]b[MASK] Allied forces . The British began reconstruction of the a[MASK]rstrip after the war ; during the project many unexploded bombs were unearthed . 
 On 5 September 1942 , Japanese[MASK]Field Marshal Prince Maida ( 前田利为 ) boarded a plane from Kuching to Labuan to off[MASK]ciate an airport that bears his name . However , he never arrived . One month later , the pla[MASK]e was found to have crashed off the coast of Tanjung Datu , B[MASK]ntulu . The cause of the plane cras[MASK] was not known . The Japanese later set up a wooden pole memorial made up of Belian wood in Bintulu[MASK]. The wooden pole was later taken back to Japan by the fa[MASK]ily of Prince Maida . 
 Chinese sawmill owners [MASK]t Sibu and Bintulu were instructed by the Japanese to produce timber fo[MASK] repairs at oil fields and ship building . During the Japanese occupation , sawmills at Bintulu produced a tot[MASK]l of 4 @,@ [MASK]00 to[MASK]s of sawn timber .

 In the 1[MASK]50s , major eco[MASK]omic activities in Bintulu were the timber extraction industry , fishing , and[MASK]Sago processi[MASK]g . In the 1960s , Bintulu was still [MASK] [MASK]mall fishing village , with a popu[MASK]ation of 5 @,@ 000 . No roads were constructed in Bintulu until 1969 when the first untarred roa[MASK] was built to connect Bintulu to Miri . The first bus that serviced the Mir[MASK] – Bintulu route w[MASK]s owned by Majlis Amanah Rakyat ( MARA ) . The MARA bus line was an initiative by the Ma[MASK]aysian federal government to provide public transportation for the people . The Iban villagers paid the bus driver with " vegetables , chickens , bamboo shoots , and other items " . Before 1960 , Bintulu was connected to Kuching by sea through a ship named " Swee Joo " . After 1960 , the ship " Chin Chin " was added to the route . It took around 36 to 48 hours to reach Bintulu from Kuchi[MASK]g ,[MASK]de[MASK]ending on the sea conditions . Due to lack of food supplies from Kuching , the villagers had to make do with limited food , and several villagers resorted to hunting in the jun[MASK]les to supplement the food supply . 
 In 1960 there were only three primary schools in Bintulu . These schools provided classes until [MASK]ri[MASK]ary 3 level . There were no secondary schools . Vil[MASK]age[MASK]s [MASK]ould pursue their secondary school studies at either[MASK]Miri or Kuching by using small boats as the[MASK]e were no roads connecting Bintulu to either Miri or Kuchi[MASK]g . Bintulu Go[MASK][MASK]rnment Secondary School was open[MASK]d in 1964 . In 1967 Bintulu celebrated the first 100 years of the Council Negri [MASK]eeting ( Sarawak State [MASK]egislative Assembly ) . A stone monument was [MASK]uilt in front of a[MASK]government rice storer[MASK]om to commemorate the event . Bintulu was a sub @-@ district of Mir[MASK] Division in the 1970s .[MASK]The [MASK]ub @-@ district was upgraded into a district in 1987 .

 The Zrinski Bat[MASK]alion ( Croatian : Bojna Zrinski ) was[MASK]a special forces unit of the Croatian National Guard ( Zbor narodne g[MASK]rde – ZNG ) and later of the Croati[MASK]n Army ( Hrvatska vojska – HV ) established[MASK]in Kumrovec on[MASK]18 May 1991 , during the Croatian War of Independence[MASK]. The u[MASK]it drew personnel from the special police forces and a former French[MASK]Foreign Legion troops serving as its c[MASK]re . The ba[MASK]tal[MASK]on was s[MASK][MASK] up and initially commanded by Ante Roso , while Major Miljenko Filipović to[MASK]k over as the commanding officer in Augus[MASK] . 
 The Zrinski Battalion trained volunteer troops in Vukovar in June [MASK]991 before[MASK]it saw action in Hrvatska Kostajnica , the Battle of Gos[MASK]ić and near Sl[MASK]no in 1991 . By the end of 1991 , the unit '[MASK] personnel were tasked with setting up an additional special forces unit of the HV . The next year its elements took part in the Battle of Kupre[MASK] and Opera[MASK]ion Tiger aimed at lifting the Siege[MASK]of Dubrovnik . It also and helped develop and train the Croatian Defence Cou[MASK][MASK]il[MASK]( Hrv[MASK]tsko vijeć[MASK] obrane – HVO ) , setting up a training ca[MASK]p in Tomislavgrad . In 1993 , the battalion took part in Operation Maslenica . In February 1994 , the Zrinski Battalion was amalg[MASK]mated with several other[MASK]HV sp[MASK]cial forces units into the 1st Croatian Guards Brigade ( 1 @.@  hr[MASK]atski gardijski zdrug ) , a component of the 1st Croatian Guards Corps ( 1 @.@  hrvatski gardijski zbor ) .

 In 1990 , following the electoral d[MASK]feat of the government of the S[MASK]cialist[MASK]Republic of Croatia , ethnic[MASK]tensions between Croats [MASK]nd Croatian Serbs worsened . The Yugoslav Pe[MASK]ple 's Army ( Jugoslavenska narod[MASK]a armija – JNA ) believed Croatia would use the Croatian Terr[MASK]torial D[MASK]fence Force 's ( Teritorijalna obrana – TO ) equipment to build its own army and confront the[MASK]JNA itself . In order to minimize the expected resis[MASK]ance , the JNA confiscated the TO weapon[MASK] . On 17 August , the tensions e[MASK]calated into an open revolt of the Croatian Serbs[MASK]. 
 In the beginning of 1991 , Croatia had no r[MASK]gular army . I[MASK] an effort to bolster its defence , Croatia doubled the size of it[MASK] police f[MASK]r[MASK]e to about 20 @,@ 000 . The most effective part of the force was the 3 @,[MASK] 000[MASK]@-@ strong special police that were deployed in 12 battalions , adopting military organisation . In addition there were 9 @,@ 000 – 10 @,@ 000 regionally organised reserve police . The rese[MASK]ve[MASK]police were set up in 1[MASK] battalions and 10 companies , but they lacked weapons needed to arm many of the tro[MASK]ps .[MASK]
 Preparations to set up the Croatian National Guard ( Zbor narodne garde – ZNG ) began on[MASK]12 A[MASK]ril 1991 . Establishment of the ZNG as a police force with mi[MASK]it[MASK]ry capabilities was thoug[MASK]t necessary by the Croatian authorities following arme[MASK] clashes in Pakrac and at Plitvice Lakes in[MASK]March and due to the possibility of furth[MASK]r confrontation with the JNA . The ZN[MASK] , formally established on 23 April , [MASK]as tasked with protection of the constitutional ord[MASK]r , maintenance of public order , anti[MASK]@-@ terrorist operations , protection of Croatia 's borders , t[MASK]rritory , coast and territorial waters , as well as[MASK]the protection of high @-@ value structures and high @-@ profile[MASK]persons .

 On 18 May 1991 , the Zrinski Batt[MASK]lion was established as a special forces unit of the ZNG . The core of the[MASK]unit consisted of 27 volunteers draw[MASK] from the Kumrovec Special Police Unit ( SPU ) . Initially [MASK] it relied on former French [MASK]oreign Legion troops . The most senior among th[MASK] fo[MASK]mer legionnaires was Ante Roso , previously a Sous @-@ Officier ( non @-@ commissioned officer – NCO ) in the 4th Foreign Regiment . In consequence , Roso was tasked with setting up the unit as i[MASK]s in[MASK]tial comma[MASK]der . Major Miljenko Filip[MASK]vić , likewise a former French Foreign Legion member , was assig[MASK]ed the battalions deputy commander . The unit was based in t[MASK]e village of Ku[MASK]rovec in the region of Hr[MASK]atsko Zagorje , on the groun[MASK]s of[MASK]the former " Josip Broz Tito " political school . The site[MASK], adjacent to [MASK]he border of Slovenia , was sele[MASK]ted to be inaccessible to Yugoslav Air Force raids without violation of Slovene or possibly Austrian airspace . In June 1991 , the Kumrovec SPU was transferred to Sljeme Peak n[MASK]r[MASK]h of Zagreb leaving Kumrovec base to the Zrinski Battalion , as well as the second special forces unit , the Frankopan Battalion . 
 The Z[MASK]inski Battalion was deployed for the first time on 15 June . It was statio[MASK]ed i[MASK] Vukovar , tasked with preparation of city[MASK]defences and or[MASK]anisation of voluntee[MASK] troops . In August , F[MASK]lipović took over command of the battalion f[MASK]om Roso . The same month , the Zrins[MASK]i Battalion was deployed to the Banovina ,[MASK]where it pushed the Croatian Serb forces [MASK]ut of the town of Hrvatska Ko[MASK]tajnica . In September , the battalion was[MASK]deployed t[MASK] Gospić , where it took part in battle to control Gospić against the JNA . Troops assigned to the [MASK]attalion captured Kaniža barracks in [MASK]ospić[MASK]. During combat in Gospić , 30 troo[MASK]s of the Zrinski Battalion[MASK], assisted by Lučko SPU , ca[MASK]tured JNA Major General Trajče Krstevski , along with three armoured personnel carriers ( APCs ) and 32 s[MASK]ldiers . The unit was deployed to Metković on 28 October , tasked with recapturing Slano from the JNA . After the deployment to Gospić , a part of th[MASK] u[MASK]it p[MASK]rsonnel left to Bosnia and Herzegovina anti[MASK]i[MASK]ating further conflict there , while the remainder of the unit[MASK]returned to Kumrovec . The ZNG was renamed the Croatian Army ( Hrvatska vojska – HV[MASK]) on 3 November 1991 . In late 1991 , personnel of [MASK]he Zri[MASK]ski Battalion set up another special [MASK]orces unit of the HV — the Matija Vlačić Batta[MASK]ion based in Opatija . 
 In 1992 , elements of the Zrinski Battalion took[MASK]part i[MASK] the Battle of Kupres , before setting up a train[MASK]ng camp in the town of Tomislavgrad . There the battalion personnel assisted in setting up and trained the Croatian [MASK]efence Council ( Hr[MASK]atsko vijeće obrane – HVO[MASK])[MASK]. Later that[MASK]year , el[MASK]ment[MASK] of the battalion took pa[MASK]t in Operati[MASK]n Tiger — aimed at lifting of the Siege of Dubrovnik . In 1993 , elements of the Zrinski Battalion took part in Operation Maslenica , fighting in the area of Škabrnja . The Central Intelligence Agency[MASK]assessed the Zrinski Battalion as one of the best units of the HV .

 On 25 February 199[MASK] , the Zrinsk[MASK] Battalion was amalgamated with parts of other special forces units of the HV : Frankopan Battalion , Ban Jelač[MASK]ć Battalion , Matija Vlačić Battalion , Ferdo Sučić Battalion and pa[MASK]t of 8th Light Assault Brigade forming the 1st Croatian Guards Brigade ( 1 @[MASK]@  hrvatski gardijski zdrug ) , a component of the[MASK]1st Croatian Guards Corps ( 1 @.@  hrvatski gardijski zbor ) , directly subordinated to the Ministry of Defence rather than the General Staff of the Armed Forces of the Republic of Croatia .

 Temple Beth Israel ( Hebrew : בית ישראל ) is a Reconstructionist synagogue l[MASK]cated at 1175 East 29th Avenue in Eugene , Oregon . Founded in the e[MASK]rly 1930s as a Conservative congregation , Beth Israel [MASK]as for ma[MASK]y decades the o[MASK]ly synagogue in Eugene . 
 The congregation initially worshipped in a converted house on[MASK]West Eighth Street[MASK]. It constructed its first bui[MASK][MASK]ing on Portland Street in 1952 , and occupied its[MASK]current LEED @-@ co[MASK]pliant facilities in 2008 . 
 In the early 1990s conflict between feminist and traditional members led to the latte[MASK] l[MASK]aving Beth Israel , and forming the Orthodox Congregation Ahavas[MASK]Torah . [MASK]eth Israel came under attack from neo @-@ Nazi members of the Volksfront twice , in 1994 and again in 2002 . In [MASK]oth cases the perpetrators were caught and convicted .

 [MASK] = Early history = = 
 
 Small numbers of Ger[MASK]an Jews began [MASK]ettling in Eugene in the l[MASK]te 19th century , but most moved on . In the early[MASK]20th century the first Eastern European Jews settled there , and by[MASK]the 1920s Eugene 's Jewish community began gathering prayer quorums for holding Friday n[MASK]ght and Je[MASK]ish holiday services in individuals ' homes . Historian Steven Lowenstein wri[MASK]es that " [MASK] a ] fter H[MASK]men Rubenstein 's death in 1933 , his[MASK]ho[MASK]e at 231 West Eighth Stre[MASK]t was remodeled and named Templ[MASK] Bet[MASK] Israel " . It was a traditional Conservative synagogue , and from that time until the 1990s it was the only synagogue in Eugene . 
 In 1952 , the congregation constructed a one @-@ story synagogue b[MASK]ildin[MASK] on an almost 1 acre ( 0 @.@ 40 [MASK]a ) property at 2550 Portland Stre[MASK]t . Designed by architect and Holocaust @-@ survivor Heinrich Hormuth ( H.H. ) Waechter ,[MASK]the building featured an interior courtyard that provided natural lighting , and " a network of ceiling beams painted with symbo[MASK]s and [MASK]hapes " by Waechter . 
 Temple Beth Israel 's services and religious functions were lay @-@ led for decades . Its first rabbi was Marcus Simmons .[MASK]Originally from[MASK][MASK]ngland , he [MASK]as a gradua[MASK]e[MASK]of University of London and Oxford University[MASK], and was ordained a[MASK] the Hebrew Theol[MASK]gical Seminary . He emigrated to the United States in 1[MASK]57 , and joined Beth Israel in 1959 . The members were not , however[MASK], agreed that a full @-[MASK] time rabbi was required , and in 1961 , he accepted a rabbinical p[MASK]sition in Downey , California . 
 Following a hiatus of two years , Louis Neimand was hired as rab[MASK]i in 1963 [MASK] Born in New York City in 1912 to immigrant parents , he was a [MASK]raduate of Ci[MASK]y University of New York and [MASK]as ordained at the Jewish Institute of New [MASK]ork . He had previously worked[MASK]for the United Jewish Appeal , a[MASK]d from 1959 to 1963 was the first Hil[MASK]el rabbi at Syracuse University . There was some conc[MASK]rn a[MASK]out Neimand 's hiring[MASK], as he h[MASK]d a police record as a result of his involvement in freedom marches in the African [MASK]-@ American Civil Rights Movement ( 1955 – 1968 ) . He served until his death in 1976 . 
 
 = = Kinberg era = = 
 
 Myron Kinberg was hired as rabbi in 1977 . Ordained in Reform Judaism ,[MASK]he had previously served as a rabbi in Topeka , Kansas for two years , [MASK]hen lived in Israel for two years , before coming to Eugene . Kinberg [MASK]as known for his support for minority rights and gay right[MASK] , anti @-@ nuclear and anti @-@ war activism , support of r[MASK]conciliation b[MASK]tween Israel and the Palestinians , and outreach to non @-@ observant members of Eugene 's Jewish community . 
 Kinberg attempted to revive the Biblical concept of the " ger toshav " in his approac[MASK] to intermarriage . He was willing to officiate at an intermarriage if th[MASK] non @-@ Jewish partner , after discussions wi[MASK]h the rabbi , agree[MASK] of his or her own free will to fulfi[MASK]l a set of commitments , including " a commitment to a Jewish home life , participation in Jewish life and tradition , [MASK]nd raising future childr[MASK]n as Jews " . The non @-@ Jewish partner making this commitment became [MASK] " ger tos[MASK]av " , or " non @-@ Jewish member of the Jewish people " . 
 Kinberg 's wife Alice was a strong feminist , and dur[MASK]ng the 1980s he and his wife supported a number of changes to the liturgy and ritual . These included allowing women[MASK]to read from the [MASK]orah and lead the prayers , and changing prayers to be more gender inclusive - fo[MASK] example , using gender @-@ neutral terms and pronouns for God , and adding referenc[MASK]s to the Biblical matriarchs in prayers like the Amidah , which tr[MASK]ditionally only mentioned the Biblical patriarchs . While most congregation[MASK]members approved of these changes , [MASK] mi[MASK]ority resisted [MASK]hem . 
 
 = = = Schism = = = 
 
[MASK]By the early 1990s serious divisions developed among the members of the congregation over [MASK] numbe[MASK] of issues , including personal antagonisms , the rabbi 's activism and " advocacy of ' ultra @-@ liberal[MASK]' causes " [MASK] political differences over t[MASK]e Israeli – Palestin[MASK]an conflict , and 
 a myriad of additional Jewish cultural / rel[MASK]gious issues[MASK], such as the acceptance of intermarried couples , adherence to kosher dietary [MASK]aws , the use of modern langu[MASK]ge and music during worship services , rewriting of certain praye[MASK]s such as the Aleynu to make them less ethnocentric , and so on . 
 However , the[MASK]biggest source of division , which underlay all others , w[MASK]s " the roles and rights of men and women in the synagogue . " 
 In the early 1990s a group of newly observa[MASK]t members began holding more trad[MASK]tional services in a back room [MASK]f the sy[MASK]agogue , complete [MASK]ith a mechitza , a partition separa[MASK]ing men and wom[MASK]n . T[MASK]e " mo[MASK]e feminist @-@ minded " members strongly o[MASK]jected to hav[MASK]ng a mechitza[MASK]anywhere in the Temple Beth Israel building , even if it were not in the services they atte[MASK]ded . The latter group eventual[MASK]y circulated a petition which stated that either the mec[MASK]itz[MASK] would have to be taken down , or those members who wanted it would have to leave . Kinberg also signed the petition . Faced with this opposition , in 1992 the Orthodox members left ,[MASK]renting[MASK]new premises and hiring the[MASK]r own rabbi , creating Eugene 's second synagogue , or[MASK]ginally called " The Halachic Minyan " , and in 1[MASK]98 renamed " Congregation Ahavas Torah "[MASK]. 
 Kinberg held himself re[MASK]ponsible , and th[MASK][MASK]schism led to his " reasse[MASK]sment of the needs of Temple Beth Israel and his role as [MASK] rabbi " . As a result ,[MASK]he left Beth Israel in 1994 to lead a syn[MASK]gogue on Long Island . During his tenure at Beth Israel , membership rose from 118 to 350 families . Kinberg died two y[MASK]ars later at age 51 .

 The congrega[MASK]ion dec[MASK]ded to leave the Conservative movement in 1995 , and for a year had n[MASK] affiliation .

 Husbands @-@ Hankin was instrumental in developing the concept of " Ethical Kashrut " , the idea that one sh[MASK]uld onl[MASK] purchase goods that are produced in an ethical way .

[MASK]In 2003 the congregation got a permit to begin construction of a new facility on the now @-@ vacant 1 @.@ [MASK]7 @-@ acre ( 0 @.@ 55 ha ) plot of land at the northwest corner of East 29th Avenue and University Street . An initial capital campaign raised more than $ 1 @.@ 8 million , which fully paid for the land , and by August 2007 an additional $ 1 @.@ 7 million had been rais[MASK]d towards anticipated overall project costs of $ 5 million . 
 The environmentally sensi[MASK]ive building was designed by Mel Solomon and Associates of Kansas City and local company TBG Architects & Planners , and built by McKenzie Commercial Const[MASK]uction of Eugene . The build[MASK]ng used " energy eff[MASK]cient heating , ve[MASK]tilation and lighting " : specific design issues with the building 's energy efficiency included the fact that the largest room in the building ,[MASK]the sanctuary , was also the least @-@ used , and , in accord with Je[MASK]ish tradition , had to face east ( towards Jeru[MASK]alem ) . 
 On June 8 , 2008 the congregation dedicated its new building at 1175 East 29th Avenue . At approximately 25 @,@ [MASK]00 squar[MASK] feet ( 2 @,@ 300 m2 ) , the facility included a sanctuary , commercial kitchen , banquet facilities , and classrooms ,[MASK]and housed the synagogue , the Lane County Jewish Federation , and the local Jewish Family Service . The project ended[MASK]up costing[MASK]$ 6 million , o[MASK] which $ 4 million had been raised . 
 Made of concrete , steel[MASK], a[MASK]d wood , the building achieved Leadership in Energy and Environ[MASK]ental Design compliance " through the integration of stormwater manag[MASK]ment strategies , high efficiency irrigation , the use of recycled and / or recyclable materials , and drought tolerant plantings . " Completely[MASK]recyclable materials used [MASK]n the structure included carpeting [MASK]nd [MASK]ood beams .

 = New [MASK]ork State Route 93 = 
 
 New York State Route 93 ( NY 93 ) is a 43 @.@ 08 [MASK]-@ mile ( 69 @.@ 33[MASK]km ) state highway in wester[MASK] New York in the United States . The r[MASK]ute begins at an intersection [MASK]ith [MASK]Y 18F in the village of Youngstown and ru[MASK]s in a general northwest – southeast direction across Niagara and Erie counties to its east e[MASK]d at an intersection with NY 5 in the to[MASK]n of Newstead , just s[MASK]uth of the village of Akron . NY 93 serves as a con[MASK]ector between several major arterials , including NY 104 in Cam[MASK]ri[MASK] , NY 31 just west of the city of Lockport , a[MASK]d NY 78 south of the city . 
 The route was assigned as part of the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York . Although it began in Young[MASK]town and ended in Newstea[MASK] as it does [MASK]o[MASK]ay , the initial routing of NY 93 deviated from the modern path in the vicinity [MASK]f the city of Lockport . From Cambria to Lockport 's eastern suburbs , the highway originally used NY 425 , Lower Mountain[MASK]Ro[MASK]d , Akron Roa[MASK] , and a series of streets in[MASK]Lockport . NY 93[MASK]was moved onto NY 104 and Junction Road in Cambria in the 1940s , and altered to bypass Lockport to the south on a new highway and Robinson and Dysinge[MASK] roads in 1991 . In 2006 , NY 93 was realigned west of Lockport to continue south on J[MASK]nction Road to NY 31 . The change removed NY [MASK]3 from Upper Mountain Road , a county @-@ owned highway that had been pa[MASK]t of the route since the 1930s .

 NY 93 begins at an intersection [MASK]ith NY 18F ( Main Street ; co @-@ designated but not signed as County Route 907 or CR 907[MASK]) in the center of the village of Yo[MASK]ngstown . The route proceeds eastward through the village as a two @-@ lane road named Lockport Str[MASK]et , serving two blocks of comm[MASK]rcial areas before bending to the northeast and passing into the residential eastern portion of[MASK]Youngstown . At the eastern village limits , NY 93 briefly widens to four lanes a[MASK] it enter[MASK] a partial clover[MASK]eaf interchange with the Niagara Scenic Parkway . Past t[MASK]e junctio[MASK] , the hi[MASK]hway[MASK]reverts to a two @-@ lane road and ch[MASK]nge[MASK] names to Youngstown – Lockport Road as it runs across the town of Porter . The residential surro[MASK]ndings c[MASK]ntinue to the hamlet of Towers Corners , where NY 93 connects to NY 18 ( Cree[MASK] Road ) . 
 After NY 18 , NY 93 curves to the southeast , serving another residential stretch ahead of a junction with You[MASK]gstown – Wilson Road ( CR 36 ) on the eastern edge of Towers Corners . After this intersection , the homes give [MASK]ay[MASK]to farms as the road heads into rura[MASK] areas of the town . The route cont[MASK]nu[MASK]s on a s[MASK]utheast track through Porter , pas[MASK]ing a mixture of rural and residential areas on its way into the hamlet of Porter Center , where NY 93 enters an intersection with Porter Center Road ( CR 57 ) . Another southeastward stretch brings the route across Twelvemile Creek and into the hamlet of Ransomville , where NY 93[MASK]becomes the community 's main street . Through Ransomv[MASK]lle , NY 93 retains the Youngstown – Lockport Road name , intersectin[MASK] with Ransomville Road ( C[MASK] 17 ) in the hamlet 's business district . 
 Just outside Ransomville , NY 93 lea[MASK]es the town of Porter for the town of Wilson . It continues [MASK]enerally southeastward across mostly open terrain , meeting Randall Road ( CR 83 ) and Church Street ( CR 56 ) on its way to the town [MASK]f Cambria . NY 93 becomes North Ridge Road at the town line , and it soon enters the hamlet of[MASK]No[MASK]th Ridge [MASK] a community built up around the[MASK]route 's intersection with NY 425 ( Cambria – Wilson Road ) .[MASK]The hamlet 's residential surroundings continue to the adjacent community of Molyneaux Corners , where NY 93 becomes concurrent wi[MASK]h NY 104 ( Ridge Road ) . NY 93 and NY 104 proceed northeast across lightly populated areas for 2 m[MASK]les ( 3 @.@ 2 km[MASK]) [MASK]o the hamlet of Warren Corners , at which point NY 93 splits from NY 104 and heads southward along Town Line Road . It immediately intersects with Stone Road ( CR 19 ) before leaving the hamlet . 
 
 = = = Lockport area = = = 
 
 Outside of Warren Co[MASK][MASK]ers , the route heads across rural areas along the Cambria – Lockport town line . It soon enters the small hamlet of Hic[MASK]ory Corners , where the road passes under Lower Mountain Road ( CR 902 ) . Access to the highway is made by way of Town Line Road Spur ( CR 114 ) , a connector leading to Lower Moun[MASK]ain Road . NY 93 continues so[MASK]thward along the town line , changing names to Jun[MASK]tion Road at an intersection with Upper Mountain Road ( CR 5 ) west of the city of Lockport . From h[MASK]re , the route c[MASK]osses over CSX Transport[MASK]tion 's Lockport S[MASK]bdivision rail line at th[MASK] hamlet of Lockport Junction[MASK]before intersecting w[MASK]th NY 31 ( Saunders Settlement Road ) a[MASK]d NY 270 ( Campbell Boulevard ) just south of the community . NY 270 begins straight ahead to the south wh[MASK]le NY 93 tu[MASK]ns northeast onto Saunders Settlement Road , be[MASK]inning [MASK] concurrency [MASK]ith NY 31 . 
 Now fully in th[MASK] town of Lockport[MASK], NY 31 and NY 93 proceed northeast [MASK]hrough an o[MASK]en area of the town as a four @-@ lane divided highway . The two routes continue to the western edge of the city of Lockport , where they intersect with U[MASK]per Mountain Road and the Lockp[MASK]rt Bypass . The overlap ends her[MASK] as NY 93 turns southeastward onto the two @-@ lane bypass . Along the bypass , NY 93 briefly enters th[MASK] city limits as it runs past several industrial facili[MASK]ies and intersects with Hinman Road ( CR [MASK]03 ) just ahead of a bridge over the Erie Canal . Past the[MASK]waterway , the bypass takes a more south[MASK]rly course through an [MASK]ndeveloped part of the town of [MASK]ockport to a jun[MASK]tion with Robinson Road ( CR 123 ) on the Lockport – Pendleton [MASK]own line . The Loc[MASK]port [MASK]ypass ends here , leaving NY 93 to turn eastward onto Robinson Road . 
 The route initially serves a line of homes as it heads along Robinson Road ; h[MASK]wever , it soon enters a commerci[MASK]l district surrounding the road 's inter[MASK]e[MASK]tion wi[MASK]h NY 78 ( Transit Road ) . At this point , [MASK]he Lo[MASK]kport – Pendleton town line turns south to follow NY 78 , l[MASK]aving NY 93 fully within the town of Lockport [MASK]s it runs ea[MASK]tward past another stretch of homes . Not far from NY 78 , NY 93 changes names to [MASK]ysinger Road at an i[MASK]tersection with Beattie Avenue ( CR 14 ) and Raymond Road ( CR 85 ) . The junction also marks a shift in the road 's surroundings as the homes give way to open , rolling terrain .[MASK]NY 93[MASK]continues eastward for several miles to the town of Royalt[MASK]n , where i[MASK] meets Riddle R[MASK]ad ( CR 35 ) and Akron Road ( CR 1[MASK]2 ) at adjacent int[MASK]rsections just ea[MASK]t of the town line .

 NY [MASK]3 takes over Akr[MASK]n Road 's name and right @-@ of @-@ way , continuing eastward past a line of scattered [MASK]omes to reach the sparsely dev[MASK]loped ha[MASK]let of Dysinger . Here , the route turns[MASK]southward at a junction with Bunker Hill Road ( CR 136 ) . Outside of Dysinger , NY 93 heads southeastward across undeve[MASK]oped areas of Royalton , connecting to Bl[MASK]ck Church Road ( CR 110 ) as it [MASK]pproaches Tonawanda Cr[MASK]ek and the Niagara – Erie county line . The road runs along the northern edge of the creek for about 1 @.[MASK] 5 [MASK]iles ( 2 @.@ 4 km ) prior to curving southward at an intersection with Wolcottsville Road ( CR 122 ) . The turn brings NY 93 acr[MASK]ss Tonawanda Creek[MASK]and in[MASK]o the Erie County town of Newst[MASK]ad , w[MASK]ere it becomes known as Maple Road and immediately intersects with CR 260 ( Koepsel Road ) . 
 [MASK]ontinuing southward , NY 93 runs across open , rolling terrain[MASK], meeting CR 259 ( Tonawanda Creek Ro[MASK]d ) on its way to the hamlet of Swifts Mi[MASK]ls . Here , the rural[MASK]surround[MASK]ngs[MASK]briefly give way to residential areas as NY 93 intersects with CR 255 ( Swift Mills Road ) in the center of the community . So[MASK]th of Swifts Mills , the road serves only intermittent stretches of homes for 2 m[MASK]les ( 3 @.@ 2 km ) , including a cluster of residences around its closely spaced intersections with CR 253 ( Carney Road ) an[MASK] CR 42 [MASK] Rapids Road ) . It continue[MASK] on a southward track past the eastern terminus of CR 218 ( Hunts Cor[MASK]er – Akron Road ) to the outskirts of the village of Akron , [MASK]here the highwa[MASK] turns east onto Lewis Road an[MASK] soon enters the village limits . NY 93 runs past a line of homes before intersecting Cedar Street [MASK] a road maintained by Erie County as [MASK]R 261 north of the vill[MASK]ge . 
 The route turns south at C[MASK]dar Street , following the residential street into downtown Akron . Here[MASK], NY 93 intersects with CR 573 ( John Street ) a[MASK] a junction that was once the western terminus of NY [MASK]67 . At this intersection , NY 93 heads west on John Street for one bloc[MASK] before continuing south on Buffalo Street for another block to Main Street . NY 93 turns westward ag[MASK]in , following Main Street through the [MASK]esternmost part of Akron 's central business district prior to cur[MASK]ing southwestward at a junction with Mechanic Str[MASK]et . The highway takes on the Me[MASK]ha[MASK]ic Street name as it cro[MASK]ses over Murder Creek and leaves downtown Akron .[MASK]Just south of [MASK][MASK]e creek , NY 93 changes nam[MASK]s [MASK]o Buell Street at an intersection with Jackson Street . 
 As the route continues southward through the sou[MASK]her[MASK] part of Akron , it serves mostly residential areas , save for an industrial complex at NY 93 's in[MASK]ersection with CR [MASK]63 ( Clarence Center Road ) and CR 167 ( Parkv[MASK]ew Drive ) . NY 93 exits[MASK]Ak[MASK]on a short distan[MASK]e south of the junction , at which point the route heads [MASK]nto another area of open fields while retaining the Buell Street name . It continues on a southward track for about 1 mile ( 1 @.@ 6 km ) to a commercialized intersection with NY 5 ( Main Road ) , where Buell Street and NY 93 both come to an end .

 NY 93 was established as part of the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York , connecting the cities and villages of Youngstown , Lockport , and Akron . While [MASK]he termini of NY 93 have remained the same to this day , several portions of the route have been realigned since that time . When NY 93 was first assigned , it turned sou[MASK]h at the hamlet of North Ridge and overlapped with NY 425 along Cambria – Wilson Road to L[MASK]wer Mountain Road , then part of NY 3 . NY 42[MASK] went west from this junction while NY 93 headed eastward , following N[MASK] 3 along Lower Mountain , [MASK]othic Hill , Upper Mounta[MASK]n , and Saunders Settlement roads to the city of Lockport . At Locust Street ,[MASK][MASK]Y 93 left NY 3 and exited the city along Locust , High , and Akron streets and Akron Road . It met its current alignment southeast of the city in Royalt[MASK]n . 
 NY 3 was [MASK]ealigned c . 1932 to follow Saunders Settlemen[MASK] Road between Shawnee Roa[MASK] ( NY 425 ) and Upper Mountain Road . The former routing of NY 3 along Shawnee , Lower Mountain [MASK] Gothic Hill , and Upper Mountain roads was redesignated as NY 3A even th[MASK]ugh all of NY 3 's fo[MASK]mer routing was already part of either NY 425 or NY 93 . The NY 3A designation was eliminated c . 1935 when NY 3 was truncated eastward to a new we[MASK]tern terminus in central New York . In the early 1940s , NY 93 was altered to follow North Ridge Road , U.S. Route 104 ( now NY 104 ) , and Junction Road between North Ridge and Lower Mountain Road . 
 Around the same time th[MASK]t NY 93 was rerouted , NY 270 was also extended northward along Junction Ro[MASK]d from NY 3[MASK] [MASK]o US 104 . As a result , NY 93 overlapped NY 270 between Lower Mountain Road and US 104 . The overlap with NY 270 remain[MASK]d in place until c . 1963 when [MASK]Y 270 was trunc[MASK]ted s[MASK]uthward to the intersection of Lower Mountain and Junction roads . NY 93 was realigned in the late 1970s to bypass Lower Mountain and Gothic Hill Roads on Junction and Upper Mountain[MASK]roads , replacing NY 270 along Junction Road . The Lower Mountain Road portion of NY 93 's for[MASK]er routing is [MASK]ow maintained by Niagara C[MASK]unty as County Route 902 ( CR 902 ) . 
 
[MASK]= = = Lockport realignments = = = 
 [MASK] The Lockport Bypass , a highway bypassing dow[MASK]town Lockport to the sout[MASK]west , was opened to [MASK]raffic on July 26 , 1991 . The highway cost $ 7 @.@ 7 million ( equivalent to $ 13 @.@ 4 million in 2016 ) to construct and extended from the junction o[MASK] NY 31 and NY 93 west of the city to Robinson Road south of downtown . NY 93 was realigned to follow [MASK]he new bypass south to Robinson Road , where it turned east and followed Robinson Road ( CR 12[MASK] ) [MASK]nd Dysinge[MASK] Road ( CR 133 ) to Akron Road in Royalton . The po[MASK]tion of Ak[MASK]on Road ( NY 93 's former routing ) east of the Lockport city limits became NY 954M , an unsi[MASK]ned reference rout[MASK] . 
 Ownership and maintenance of Robinson Road fr[MASK]m the bypass to NY 78 was transferred from Niagara County to the state of New York on September 1 , 1990 , [MASK]s part of a highway maintenan[MASK]e swap be[MASK]ween the tw[MASK] levels of government . The portion of NY 93 between NY 78 and [MASK][MASK]ron Road became state @-@ maintained on October 1 , 19[MASK]8 , as part of another swap that al[MASK]o transferred ownership and maintenance of Akron Road to Niagara County . Akron Road is now CR 142[MASK]. 
 On November 1 , 2005 , the Nia[MASK][MASK]ra County Legislature voted on a measure to al[MASK]ow the county to ask the New York State Depa[MASK]tment of Transportation ( NYSDOT ) to remove the NY 93 designation from Upper Mountain Road , a county @-@ maintained highway , and reassign it to Junction Road[MASK]( NY 270 ) a[MASK]d Saunders Settlement Road ( NY 31 ) . The[MASK]impetus for the change came from a resident of Upper Mountain Road , who dem[MASK]nded that trucks should be removed from the roadway . This part of the agenda was p[MASK]ssed . NYSDOT obli[MASK]ed t[MASK] the request in 2006 , rerouting NY 93 as proposed and truncating NY 270 southward[MASK]to NY 31 .

 Typhoon Krosa , known in the Philippines as T[MASK]phoon Vinta , was a typhoon that made landfall in the northern Ph[MASK]lippines in late October 2013 . Forming on[MASK]Octobe[MASK] 27 near Guam , the storm slowly intensified while moving westward . Krosa developed an eye and became a typhoon before striking Luzon on October 31 . The storm weakened over land[MASK], but re @-@ intensified over the South China Sea , reaching peak winds of 150 km / h ( 90 mph ) on November 2 off[MASK]the southeast coast of China . Typhoon Krosa stalled and encountered u[MASK]favorable conditions , resulting in[MASK]quick weakening . By Novemb[MASK]r 3 , it had w[MASK]akened to tropic[MASK]l storm status , and w[MASK]s no longer being warned on by the next day . In northern Luzon , Krosa damag[MASK]d 32 @,@ 000 houses , including 3 @,@ 000 that were destroyed , and caused four fatalities . [MASK]igh winds and rainfall left P277 million ( PHP , $ 6 @.@[MASK]4 million USD ) in damage .

 On Oct[MASK]ber 27 , an a[MASK]ea of convection with a broad circulation persisted s[MASK]utheast of Guam , and slowly consolidated due to moderate wind shear and wester[MASK]y outflow . That day , the Japan Meteorologic[MASK]l Agency ( JMA ) classified the system as[MASK]a tropical depression about [MASK]80 km ( 235 mi ) to the southe[MASK]st of Hagåtña , Guam . At 2100 UTC [MASK][MASK] October 28 , [MASK]he Philippine Atmospheric , Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration ( PAGASA ) began is[MASK]uing advisories on the depression , giv[MASK]ng it the local name Vinta . The next day , [MASK][MASK]e JMA upgrad[MASK]d the depression to Tropical Storm Krosa ( 1329 ) ,[MASK]and [MASK]he Joint Typhoon Warning Center ( J[MASK]WC ) also classified it as [MASK]ropical D[MASK]pression 29W . By that time , the storm was movi[MASK]g steadily westward due to the subtropical ridge to the north . With the warm waters of the Philippine Sea , lessening wind shear , and improving outflow , Krosa gradually strengthened , and the JTWC also upgraded Krosa to tropical storm s[MASK]atus [MASK]n October 30 after an eye feature developed . 
 While approaching northern Luzon on October 29 , Krosa quickly intensified as the initial e[MASK]e feature organized into a well @-@ defined[MASK]eye . Late on October 30 , the JTWC upgraded Krosa to typhoon status , and the next day , both PAGASA and JMA followed suit[MASK]. On October 31 , Krosa made [MASK]andfall in northeastern Luzon near Cagayan , and developed a symmetric eyewall while initially m[MASK]ving over land .

 Before Krosa struck the [MASK]hilippines , PAGASA[MASK]issued a number 3 warning signal [MASK]or portions of northern Luzon , where winds were expected to reach over 100 km / h ( 60 mph ) . The agency noted for the potential for flooding and l[MASK]ndslides . High winds knocked down t[MASK]ees across Luzon , and left about 80 % of Cagayan province witho[MASK]t[MASK]power , as well as some areas without internet [MASK]r[MASK]cellphone service . Portions of the Pan[MASK]@-@ Philippine Highway were blocked , and [MASK]n La[MASK] @-@ Lo , Cagayan , a ca[MASK] crashed into a gasoline truck due to power outages .

 [MASK]irby 's Block [MASK]all is a 1995 action video game , a spin @-@ off from the Kirby series for the Game Boy portable console . It is a Breakout clone ; the player controls paddles along the screen 's edge to knock a bouncing ball , Kirby , into destructible bricks . The game 's 55 level[MASK] include power @-@ ups , bonus rounds [MASK] and minig[MASK]mes . Kirby 's Block Ball was[MASK]develop[MASK]d by HAL Laboratory and Nintendo R & D1 .

 = = Gameplay = = 
 
 The player controls paddles along th[MASK] screen 's e[MASK]ge[MASK] to knock a bo[MASK]ncing ball[MASK], Kirby , into destructible bricks . The player loses a li[MASK]e if Kirby hits the edge of the screen . E[MASK]ch of the [MASK]ame 's eleven stages include fi[MASK]e rounds of increasingly complex block patterns for Kirby to clear . The ten different block types var[MASK] in durability[MASK]and points value . A well @-@ timed hit of the paddle gives Kirby a powerful bounce to [MASK]reak through harder blocks . Another block type turns the remaining blocks into a bonus round that rewards the player for clearing the screen in the least [MASK]mount of time . The player can find warp stars that lead to minigames , such as air hockey , whe[MASK]e the player can earn extra lives .[MASK]The rounds also includ[MASK] enemies to attack and avoid . Some enemies contain[MASK]bonus items . Each stage ends in a boss fight . 
 With stone , needle , flame , and spark power @-@ ups , Kirby can transform to interact with blocks differently . For instance , the spark pow[MASK]r @-@ up lets Kirby break through o[MASK]herwise in[MASK]estructible blocks , and the needle lets Kirby hit spikes once without losing a life . The game has a themed frame and uses a wide palette of colors in[MASK]@-@ game when played with the S[MASK]per Game Boy .

 The game was developed by HAL Laboratory with Gunpei Yokoi 's Nintendo R & D1 , and published by Nintendo .

The team spent six months comple[MASK]ely revising the game under explicit [MASK]nstructio[MASK]s on how Kirby should move . Kirby games contain elements of unrestricted , creative movement as a g[MASK]neral theme . Kirby 's[MASK]Block Ball was released for the Game Boy first in Japan in 1995 and later in Europe ( 1995 ) and North America ( May 1996 ) .

 [MASK]n release , the four reviewers of Electronic Gaming Monthly applauded Kirby 's Block Ball for modifyi[MASK]g the Breakout formula to create [MASK] new and enjoyable game . They especially praised the unique power @-@ ups , though Crispin Boyer and Sushi X also felt the game was too short and easy . Ninte[MASK]do Power said they enjoyed Block Ball and its numbe[MASK] of[MASK][MASK]tages , but wondered how its[MASK]eight megabits of memory were being us[MASK]d . The magazine found the parts[MASK]where Kirby eats the unbreakable blocks to be innova[MASK]ive . All six of the magazine 's reviewers recommended the game . 
 IGN wrote that the game [MASK]as primarily remembered as " an Arkanoi[MASK] or Breakout clon[MASK] skinned with the Kirby fran[MASK]hise " . IGN calculated an average reviewer score of 7 @.@ 4 / 10 . The Kirb[MASK] serie[MASK] became known for its number of non @-@ platformer spin @[MASK]@ offs , of which Block Ball[MASK]was one , like Kirby 's Pinball Land and Kirby 's Dream Course . Kirby 's spherical shape lent it[MASK]elf towards ball @-@ like roles . IGN wrote tha[MASK] Block Ball was the first " truly out there " Kirby spin @-@ off , but that the game was too sho[MASK]t . 
 Planet Game Boy called it one of the origi[MASK]al G[MASK]me B[MASK]y 's ten " all @-@ time classics " and GamesRadar place[MASK] it among the t[MASK]p 25 Game Boy games released . T[MASK][MASK]y considered Kirby 's[MASK]Block Ball an improvement upon Al[MASK]eyway , a Game Boy launch title and Breakout clone . IGN recommended the game upon its 3DS rerelease both in general and for Breakout [MASK]ans . Ninte[MASK]do Wo[MASK]ld Report recomm[MASK]nded the game to p[MASK]ayers who like score at[MASK]ack games and called it the best ver[MASK]ion of[MASK]Breakout released[MASK]. Retrospective reviewers found the game enjoyable and praised the craft behin[MASK] the gameplay and Kirby themes . Alternatively , Kirby 's Block Ball received the lowest rating on Tim Rogers 's 2004 " Yamanote Scoring System [MASK]or Portable Games " ( a metric by which he played a game while counting stops on the circular Yamanote train li[MASK]e until he lost interest )[MASK]with a score of " one " stop .

 In a retrospective review , Jeuxvideo.com had high[MASK]praise for the level design , graphics ,[MASK]and animations . They also found the music excell[MASK]n[MASK] in comparison to the an[MASK]oying and repetitive soundtrack of most Breakout clones . The mag[MASK]zine also liked how the game fit t[MASK]e Kirby u[MASK]iverse , apart from its increased difficulty — Jeuxvideo.com occasionally had trouble hitting the slow @-@ paced ball with [MASK]reci[MASK]ion .

 On the outbreak of World War I in 1914 , Fabian Ware , a director of the Rio Tinto Company , found that at 45 years old he was too old to join the British A[MASK]my . He[MASK]used the influence of Rio Tinto chairman [MASK] Viscount Milner , to become the commander of a mobile u[MASK]it of the British Red[MASK]Cross . He arrive[MASK] in France in Septem[MASK]er 1914 and whilst th[MASK]re was struck by the lack of any official mechanism for documentin[MASK] or marking the location of graves of those who had been killed and f[MASK]lt compelled to create an or[MASK]anisation wi[MASK]hin the Red Cross for this purpose . In March 1915 , with the support of Nevi[MASK] Macready , Adjutant @-@ General of th[MASK] Bri[MASK]ish Exp[MASK]ditionary Forc[MASK] , Ware 's work was given official recognit[MASK]on and support by the Imperial War Office and the unit was transferred to[MASK]the British Army as the Graves[MASK]Registration Commission . The new Graves Registration Commission had [MASK]ver 31 @,@ 000 graves of British and Imperial soldiers registered by October 1915 [MASK]nd 50 @,@ 000 registered by May 1916 [MASK] 
 When municipal graveyards began to overfill Ware bega[MASK] negoti[MASK][MASK]ions with various local au[MASK]h[MASK]rities [MASK]o acquire land fo[MASK] [MASK]urther cemeteries . [MASK]are began with an agreement with France to build joint British and French cemeteries under the understanding that these would be maintained by the French government . Ware event[MASK]ally concluded that it was not prudent to leave the maintenance responsibilities solely to the French gov[MASK]rnment and subsequently arranged for France to purchas[MASK] the land , gra[MASK]t it in perpetuity , and leave the management and main[MASK]enance responsibilities to the British . The French government agreed under the condition that cemeteries respected c[MASK]rtain dimensions , were accessib[MASK]e by public road , were in the vicinity of medical aid station[MASK] and were no[MASK] too close to towns or villages . Similar negotiations were sta[MASK]ted with the Belgian go[MASK]e[MASK]nment . 
 As [MASK]eports of the grave registration work became public , the Comm[MASK]s[MASK]ion began to receive letters of enquiry and requests for photograp[MASK]s of grav[MASK]s from relatives of deceased soldie[MASK]s . By 1917 , 17[MASK]@,@ [MASK]00 photographs had been dispatched to relatives . In March 1915 , the Commission , with [MASK]he support of the Red Cross , began to dispatch photographic prints and cemetery location informatio[MASK] in answer to the requests . The Graves Registration Commission became the D[MASK]rectorate of Graves[MASK]Reg[MASK]s[MASK]ration and Enquiries in the spring of 1916 [MASK]n recognition of the fact that the scope of work began to extend beyond simpl[MASK] grave reg[MASK]stration and bega[MASK] to include responding to enquiries from relatives of those kille[MASK] . The [MASK]irectorate 's work was also extended beyo[MASK]d the Western Fro[MASK]t and into othe[MASK] theatres of war , with units deployed in Greece , Egypt and Mesopotamia .

 As the war continued , Ware and others became concerned about the fate of the graves in the post @-@ wa[MASK] period . Following a suggestion by the British Army , the National Committee for the Care of Soldiers ' Graves was appointed b[MASK] the British government in January 1916 , with Edward , Prince of Wales agreeing to serve as [MASK]resid[MASK]nt . The National Committee f[MASK]r[MASK]the Care of Soldiers ' Graves was created with the intention of taking over[MASK]the work of the Directorate of Graves Registration and Enquiries after the war . The government felt that it was more appropriate to[MASK]entrust the work to a specially appointed body ra[MASK]h[MASK]r than to any existing [MASK]overnment department . By early 1917 a number of members of the committee believed a [MASK]orma[MASK] imperial organisation would be needed to care for the graves . With the help of Edward , Prince of Wales ,[MASK]Ware submitted a [MASK]emorandum to the Im[MASK]erial War Conferen[MASK]e in 1917 suggesting that an imperial organisation be constituted . The suggestion was accepted and on 21 May 1917 the [MASK]mpe[MASK]ial War Graves Commission was established by Royal Charter , with the Prince of Wales servi[MASK]g as pr[MASK]sident , Secretary of State for[MASK]War Lord [MASK]erby as chairman and Ware as vice @-@ chairman . The Commission 's undertakings began in earnest at the en[MASK] of the F[MASK]rst World War . Once land for cemeteries and memo[MASK]ials had been guaranteed , the enormous task of recording the details of the de[MASK]d could begin . By 1918 , some 587 @,@[MASK]000 graves had been id[MASK]ntifi[MASK][MASK] and a further 559 @,@ 000 cas[MASK]alties were registered as having no known [MASK]rave . 
 The scale ,[MASK]and associated high[MASK]number of casualties , of the war prod[MASK]ced an entirely new attitu[MASK]e towards the commemoration of war dead . Previou[MASK] to World War I , indiv[MASK]dual commemoration of war dead was often on an ad hoc basis and was almost exclusively limited to [MASK]ommissioned officers [MASK] [MASK]owever , the war required mobilisation of [MASK] significant percentage of the population , either as volunteers or[MASK]through conscription . An expectatio[MASK] had consequently arisen that [MASK]ndividual sol[MASK]iers would expect to be commemora[MASK]ed , even if they were low @-@ ranking members of the military . A committee under Frederic Kenyon [MASK] Director of t[MASK]e British Museum , presented a report to the Commission in November [MASK]91[MASK] detailing how it e[MASK]visioned the development of the cemeteries . Two key [MASK]lements of t[MASK]is report were that bodies sh[MASK]uld not be repatriated and that uniform memorials should be used to avoid class distinctions . Beyond the logistical nightmare of re[MASK]urning home so many co[MASK]pses , it was felt that repatriation would confl[MASK]ct with the feeling o[MASK] brotherhood that had developed[MASK]between serving ranks [MASK] 
 An article in The Times on 17 February 1919 by Rud[MASK]ard Kipling carr[MASK]ed the Commission 's pr[MASK]posal to a wider audience and described what the graves [MASK]ould look like . The article entitled War[MASK]Graves : Work of Imperial Commission : Mr. Kipling 's Survey was quickly republished as an illustrated booklet , Graves of the Fallen . The illustrated booklet was intended to soften the impact[MASK]of Kenyon 's report as[MASK]it included illustrations of cemeteries with mature trees and shrubs ; contrasting[MASK]the bleak landscapes depicted in published battlefield photos . There was an immediate public outcry following the publication of the reports , particularly with regards to the decision to not repatriate the bodies of the dead . The reports generated considerable discussion in the press which ultimately led to a heated debate in Parliament on 4 May[MASK]1920 . Sir James Remnant start[MASK]d the debate , followed by speeche[MASK] by William Burdett @-@ Coutts i[MASK] favou[MASK] of the Commission 's principles and Robert Cecil speaking for [MASK]ho[MASK]e desiring repatriation and opposing uniformity of grave markers . Winston Churchill closed the debate and asked that the issue not proceed to a vote . Remnant[MASK]withdrew his motion , allowing the Commission t[MASK] carry [MASK][MASK]t its work assured of support for its principles . 
 
 = = = First cemeteries and memorials to the missing = =[MASK]= 
 
 Three of the most eminent architects of their day , Sir Herbert Bake[MASK] [MASK] Sir Reginald Blomfield , and Sir Edwin Lutyens were commissioned to design t[MASK]e cemeteries and memorials . Rudyard Kipling wa[MASK] appointed literary adv[MASK]sor for the langua[MASK]e used for memorial inscriptions . 
 In 1920 , the Commission built three[MASK]experimental cemeteries at Le Treport , Forceville and Louvencourt , following the pr[MASK]nciples outlined in the K[MASK]nyon report . Of these , the Forceville Comm[MASK]nal Ce[MASK]etery and Extension was agreed to be the mo[MASK]t successful . Having co[MASK]sulted with garden designer Gertrude Jekyll , the archit[MASK]cts created a walled ceme[MASK]ery with uniform headstones in a ga[MASK][MASK]en setting , augmented by Blomfield 's Cross of Sacrifice and Lutyens ' Stone of Remembrance . After some adjustments , F[MASK]rceville became [MASK]he temp[MASK]ate for the Commission 's building programme . Adjustments were required because all three expe[MASK]imental cemeteries went over budget . To [MASK]nsure future cemeteries remained within their budget the Commission decided to not build shelters in cemeteries that con[MASK]ained less than 200 graves , to not place a Stone of Remembrance in any cemetery with less than 400 graves , and to limit the height of cemetery walls to 1 metre ( 3 @.@ 3 ft ) . 
 At the end of 1919 , the Commission had spent £[MASK]7 @,@ 500 , and this figure rose t[MASK] £ 250 @,@ 000 i[MASK] 1920 as construction of cemeteries[MASK]and memorials [MASK]ncreased . By 1921 , the Commission had established 1 @,@ 000 cemeteries which were ready for he[MASK]dstone erections , an[MASK] burials . Between 1920 and 1923 , the Commission was shipping 4 @,@ 000 headstones a week to France . In many cases sm[MASK]ll cemeteries were [MASK]losed an[MASK] the graves concentrated in larger ones . By 1927 , when the majority of construction had been completed , over 500 cemeteries had been built , with 400 @,@ 000 headstones , a thousand Crosses of[MASK]Sacrifice , and 400 Stones of Remembrance . 
 T[MASK]e Commission had also been mandated to individually commemorate each soldier who had no kn[MASK]wn grave , which amo[MASK]nted to 315 @,@ 000 in France and Belgium alone . The Commission in[MASK]tially decided to build 12 monuments on which to commemorate the missing ; each memorial being located[MASK]at the site of an important battle a[MASK]ong the Western Front . After resistance from the French committee responsible for the approvals of memorials on French territory , the[MASK]Commission revised their plan [MASK]nd re[MASK]uced the number of memorials , and in some cases built memorials to [MASK]he missing in existing ce[MASK]eteries rather than as separate structures . 
 Regin[MASK]ld Blomfield 's Menin Gate was the f[MASK]rst memorial to the miss[MASK]ng [MASK]ocated in Europe to be completed , and was unveiled on 24 July 1927 . [MASK]he Menin Gate ( Menenpoort ) was f[MASK]und to have insufficient space to contain all the names as orig[MASK]nally [MASK]lanned and 34 @,@ 984 names of the missing were ins[MASK]ead inscribed on Herbert Baker 's Tyne Cot Memorial to the Missi[MASK]g . Other memorials followed : the Helles Memo[MASK]ial [MASK]n Gallipoli designed by John James Burnet ; the Thiepval Memorial on the Somme [MASK]nd the Arras Memorial designed by Edw[MASK]n Lutyens ; and the Basr[MASK] Memorial in Iraq designed by Edward P[MASK]ioleau Warren [MASK] The Dominions and India[MASK]also erected memorials[MASK]on which they comme[MASK][MASK]rated their missing : the Neuve @-[MASK] Chapelle[MASK]Memorial for the forces of India , the Vimy Memorial by Canada , the Villers @-@ Bretonneux Memorial by Australia , the Delville Wood[MASK]Memorial by South Africa and the Beaumont @-@ Hamel Memorial by Newfoundland . The programme of [MASK]ommemorating the[MASK]dead of the Great War was considered essentially complete with the inauguration [MASK]f the Thiepval Memorial in 1932 , though the Vimy Memorial would not be f[MASK]nished until 19[MASK]6 , the Villers @-@ Bretonneux Memorial until 1938[MASK]and stonemasons were still conducting w[MASK]rk on the Menin Gate when Germany invaded Belgium in 1940 . 
 The only memorial created by the Commiss[MASK]on tha[MASK] was not in t[MASK]e form of a monument or cemetery was the Opththalmic Institute at Giza , Egy[MASK]t — complete with library , and bac[MASK]eriology and pathol[MASK]gy departments — as its memorial to men of the Egyptian Labour Corps and Camel Transport Corps . Its erection was agreed[MASK]with l[MASK]cal politica[MASK] pressure .

 From [MASK]he start of the Seco[MASK]d World War in 1939 , the Commission organised grave registration units a[MASK]d , planning ahead based on the experience gained fro[MASK] the First World War , earmarked land for use as cemeteries . When the war began turning in f[MASK]vour of the Allies , the Commission was able to[MASK]begin restoring its First World War cemeteries and memorials . It also began the task of c[MASK]mmemo[MASK]ating the 600 @,@ 000 Commonwealth casualties from the Second World War . In 1949 , the Commission completed Dieppe Canadian War Cemet[MASK]ry , the first of [MASK]59 new cemeteries and 36 new memorials .[MASK]Eventually , over 350 @,@ 000 new headstones[MASK]were erected . Many were made from Hopton Wood stone . The wider scale of World War II , [MASK]oupled with manpower shortages and unrest i[MASK] some countries , meant that the con[MASK]truction and restoration progra[MASK]mes took much longer . Following the war , the Commission implemented a five @-@ year horticultural renovation programme . The horticultural neg[MASK]ect was largely addressed by 1950 but there were [MASK]ecessary structural repairs to be made . These , tog[MASK]ther with the backlo[MASK] of maintenance tasks from before the war , took a further 10 years to complete and the programme was not completed until the 1960s . 
 With the increa[MASK]ed n[MASK]mber of[MASK]civi[MASK]ian casualties compared wit[MASK] the World War I , Winston Ch[MASK]rch[MASK]ll agreed t[MASK] Ware 's proposal that the Commission also maintain a record of Commonwealth civilian war deaths . A supplemental chapter[MASK]was added to the Im[MASK]erial War Graves Commission 's [MASK]harter on [MASK] February 1941 , empow[MASK]ring the organisation to collect and record [MASK]he[MASK]names o[MASK] civilia[MASK]s who died from enemy action during the Second World War , which resulted in the creation of the Civilian War Dead Roll of Honour . The roll eventually contained the names of ne[MASK]rly[MASK]67 @,@ 000 civilians . The Commission and th[MASK] Dean of Westminster reached an agreement that the roll would eventually be placed i[MASK] Westminster Abbey but not until the roll was comp[MASK]ete and hostilities had ended . The Commission handed over the first six volumes to[MASK]the Dean of Westminster on[MASK]21 February 1956 ; the[MASK]final volume w[MASK]s added to the showcase in 1958 .

 Following World War II the Commission recognised that the word ' I[MASK]perial ' within its name w[MASK]s no longer appropriate . In the spirit of strengthening national and[MASK]regional feelings the organisation 's name was changed to Commonwealth War Graves Co[MASK]mission [MASK]n 1960 . 
 M[MASK]re recent conflicts have some[MASK]imes ma[MASK]e it impossible for the Commission to care for cemeteries [MASK]n a given region or[MASK]resulted i[MASK] the destruction of sites altoget[MASK]er . Zehrensdorf Indian Cemetery in Germany was unkempt after the end of World War II and until the German reunification because it was located in an area occupied by Russian forces and was not entirely rebuilt until 2005 . The Six @-[MASK] Day War and War of Attrition resulted in the destruction of Port Tewfik Memorial and Aden Memorial , and[MASK]the death of a Commission gardener at Suez War Memorial Cemetery . During the Lebanese Civil War two cemeterie[MASK] in Beirut we[MASK]e dest[MASK]oyed and had [MASK]o be rebuilt . The maintenance of [MASK]ar graves and memorials in Iraq has [MASK]emained difficult since Iran – Iraq War in the 1980s , with regular mai[MASK]tenance being impractical since after the Gulf War . 
 The Comm[MASK]ssion has , and continues to , also provide support for war graves outside its traditional mandate . In 1982 , the British Ministry of Defence requested the Commission 's assistance to design and construct cemeteries in the Falkland Islands for those killed duri[MASK]g the[MASK]F[MASK]lklands War . Although these cemeteries are not Commonwealth War Graves Commission cemeteries , the [MASK]ommission manages the administrative [MASK]esponsibilities of these[MASK]ce[MASK]eteries . Since 2005 , the Commission has c[MASK]rried out similar management duties on behalf of the British Ministr[MASK] of Defence for cemeteries and graves of British and Imperial soldiers who died duri[MASK]g the Second Boer War . In 2003 , Veterans[MASK]Affairs Canada employed the Commission to develop an approach to locate grave markers[MASK]for which [MASK]he Canadian Minister of Veterans[MASK]Affairs has responsibility . As of 2[MASK]11 , the Commission con[MASK]ucts a twelve @-[MASK] year cyclical inspection programme of Canadian veterans ' mark[MASK]rs installed at the expense of the Government of Cana[MASK]a . 
 In 2008 , an exploratory excavation discovered mass graves on the edge of Pheasant Wood outside of Fromelles . Two @-@ hund[MASK]ed and fifty British and Au[MASK]tralian bodies were[MASK]excavated from fiv[MASK] mass graves which were interred in the newly constructed Fromelles ( Pheasant Wood ) Military Cemetery . This was the first new Commonwealth War Graves Commission cemetery in more than 50 years , the las[MASK] such c[MASK]meteries having been built after th[MASK][MASK]Second World War .

 The Co[MASK]mission is currently responsible for the continued commemoration of 1 @.@ 7 million deceased Commonwealth military service m[MASK]mbers in [MASK]53 countries and approxi[MASK]ately 67 @,@ 000 civilians who d[MASK]ed as a result of enemy action [MASK]uring World War II . Commonwealth military service members [MASK][MASK]e commemorated by name on either a headstone , at an[MASK]identi[MASK]ied si[MASK]e o[MASK] a burial , or on a memorial . As a result , the Commission is curr[MASK]ntly responsible for the care[MASK]of war dead at over 23 @,@ 000 separate burial sites an[MASK] maintenance of more than 200 memorials wo[MASK]ldwide . The vast majority[MASK]of burial s[MASK]tes are pre @-@ existing communal or muni[MASK]ipal cemeteries and parish churc[MASK]yards located in the United Kingdom , however the Commission has itself constructed[MASK]a[MASK]proximately 2 @,@ 500 war cemeteri[MASK]s worldwide . The C[MASK]mmission has also constructed or commissioned memorials to commemorate the [MASK]ead who have no known grave ; the largest of these is the T[MASK]iepval Memorial .[MASK]

 The Com[MASK]ission only c[MASK]mmemo[MASK]ate[MASK] those who have died during the designated war years , while in Commonwealth military[MASK]service or of causes attributable to service . The applicable periods of consideration are 4 August 1914 to 31 August 1921 for the First World War and 3 September 1939 to 31 Dece[MASK]ber 1947 for the Second World War . The end date for the First World War period is the official end of th[MASK] war , while for the Second Wor[MASK]d War the Commission selected a date approximately the same period after VE Day as the official end of the First World War was after [MASK]he 1918 Armistice . 
 Civilia[MASK]s who died as a result of [MASK]nemy action during the Second World War are commemorated differently from those that died as a result of military service . They are commemorated by nam[MASK] through[MASK]the Civilian War Dead Roll of Honour located in St Geo[MASK]ge 's Chapel in Westminster Abbey . In addition[MASK]to its mandated duties , the Commission maintains , [MASK]nder arrangement with applicable governments , over 40 @,@ 000 non @-@ Commonwealth war graves and over 25 @,@ 000 non @-@ war military and ci[MASK]ilian graves .

 As well as the main Principal Architects for France and Belgium ( Baker , Blomfield and Lut[MASK]ens ) , there[MASK]were Principal Architects appointed for other region[MASK] as well . Sir Robert Lorimer was Principal Architect for Italy , Macedo[MASK]ia and Egypt , while Sir John James Burnet was Principal Architect for Palestine and Gallipoli , ass[MASK]sted by Thomas Smith[MASK]Tait .[MASK]The Principal Architect f[MASK]r Mesopotamia was Edward Prioleau Warren . 
 As well as these seni[MASK]r architects , there was a team of Assistant Architects[MASK]who w[MASK]re actual[MASK]y respons[MASK]ble for many of the cemetery and memorial designs . These architects were younger[MASK], and many of them had served in[MASK]the war . The Assistant Architects we[MASK]e : George Esselmont Gordon [MASK]eith , Wilf[MASK]ed Clement von Berg , C[MASK]arles Henry Holden ( who in 1920 became a Principal Architect ) , William Harrison Cowlishaw , William Bryce Binnie , George Hartley Goldsmith , Frank Higginson , Arthur Ja[MASK][MASK]s Scott Hutton , Noel Ackroyd Rew , and John Reginald Truelove . Other architects that worked for the Commission , or won c[MASK]mpetitions for the Commission memorials , included Ge[MASK]rge Salway Nicol , Harold Chalton Bradshaw , Verner Owen Rees ,[MASK]Gordon H. Holt , and Henry Philip Cart de Lafontaine . 
 In January 1944 , Edward Maufe was a[MASK]pointed Principal Architect[MASK]for the UK . Maufe[MASK]worked extensively for t[MASK]e Commission for 25 years until 1969 , becomin[MASK] Chief Architect and also succeeding Kenyon as [MASK]rtistic Advisor . Together with Maufe , the [MASK]the[MASK] Principal Architects appointed du[MASK]ing and after the Second World War were Hubert Worthington , Louis de Soissons , Philip Hepworth and Colin [MASK]t Clair Oakes . 
 Leading scu[MASK]ptors that worked on the me[MASK]ori[MASK]ls and cem[MASK]teries after the First World War included Eric Henri Kennington , Cha[MASK]les [MASK]homas W[MASK]eeler , Gilbert Ledward , and Charles Sargeant Jagger .

 = = = Cemetery design = = = 
 
 
 = = = = Common architectural design features = = = = 
 
 Structural design has always played a[MASK] important part in the Com[MASK]ission 's ceme[MASK]eries . Apart from a few [MASK]xceptions , due to local geological conditions , the cemeteries f[MASK]llow the same design an[MASK] uniform aesthetic [MASK]ll over the world . This makes the cemeteries easily recognisable and distinguishes them from war graves administered by other groups or countries . 
 A typical ceme[MASK]ery is surrounded by [MASK] low wall or hedge and wi[MASK]h a wrought @-@ iron gate entran[MASK]e . For cemeteries in France and Belgium , a land tablet near the entrance or along a wall identifies the cemetery grounds as ha[MASK]ing been provide[MASK] by the French or Belgian governments . All but the small[MASK]st [MASK][MASK]meteries contain a register with an inventory of the burials[MASK], a plan of the plots and rows , and a basic history of the cemetery . The register is located within a metal cupboard that is marked with a cross locate[MASK] in either the wall [MASK]ear the cemete[MASK]y entrance or in a shelter within the cemetery . More recently , in [MASK]arger sites , a stainles[MASK] steel notice gives details of the respective military campaign . The headstones within the ceme[MASK]ery[MASK]are of a uniform size [MASK]nd design and mark plots of equal size . 
 The cemetery g[MASK]ounds are[MASK], exce[MASK]t in dr[MASK]er climates , grass covered with a floral border aro[MASK]nd the h[MASK]adstones . There is also an absence[MASK]of any paving between the he[MASK]dstone rows which is intended to make the cemete[MASK]y feel like a traditional walled garden where visitors cou[MASK]d exper[MASK]ence a sense of peace . H[MASK]wever , Carter and Jackson argue that the uniform aesthetics are designed to evoke a positive experience which delibera[MASK]e[MASK]y mask[MASK] and sanitises the nature of the war deaths . 
[MASK]
 = = = = Cross of Sacrifice [MASK]nd Stone of Remembrance = = = = 
 
 Typically , cemeteries of more than [MASK]0 graves contain a Cross of Sacrifice designed by architect Reginald Blomfield . This cross was designed to imitate medieval crosses found in ch[MASK]rchyards in England with proportions more common[MASK]y seen in the C[MASK]ltic cross . T[MASK]e cross is normally a freestan[MASK]ing four @-@ poin[MASK] limestone Latin cross , mounted on an octagonal base , and ranging in height from 14 to 32 feet . A bronze longswor[MASK] , blade down , is embedded on the face of the cross . This cross represents the faith of the majority of the[MASK]dead and the sw[MASK]rd represents[MASK]the military character of the cemetery , intended to link British soldiers a[MASK]d the Christian concept of [MASK]elf [MASK]-@ sac[MASK]ifice . 
 Cemeteries wit[MASK] more than 1000 burials typically have a Stone of Remembrance , designed b[MASK] Edwin Lutyens with the inscription " The[MASK]r Name Liveth for Evermore " [MASK] The co[MASK]cept of the Stone o[MASK] Reme[MASK]brance stone was developed by Rudyard Kiplin[MASK] t[MASK] commemorat[MASK] those of all faiths and none respect[MASK][MASK]ely [MASK] In contrast to the Cross of Sacrifice , the design fo[MASK] the stone deliberately avoided " sh[MASK]pes associated with [MASK]articular religions " . The geometry of the structure was based on studies of the Parthenon . Each stone is 3 @.@ 5 metres ( 11 ft ) long and 1 [MASK].@ 5 metres ( 4 @.@ 9 ft ) high . The shape of the ston[MASK] has been compared both to that of a sarcophagus and an altar . The feature was designed [MASK]sing the principl[MASK] of entasis . The subtle [MASK]urves in the design , if[MASK]extended , would form a sphere 1[MASK]@,@ 801 feet [MASK] inches ( 549 @.@ 15 m[MASK]) in diameter . 
 
 = = = = Headstones = = = = 
 
 Every grave is marked with a headstone . Each headstone contains the national[MASK]emblem or regimental badge , rank , nam[MASK] , unit , date of death [MASK]nd age of each casualty inscribed[MASK]above[MASK]an appropriate religious s[MASK]mbol and a more personal dedication chosen by relatives . The headstones use a[MASK]standard upper case l[MASK]ttering designed by MacDonald Gill . Individual graves are arranged , where possible , in str[MASK]ight rows and marked by uniform [MASK]eadstones , [MASK]he vast majority of which are ma[MASK]e of [MASK]ortland stone . The original headstone dimensions were 76 centimetres ( 30 in ) tall , [MASK]8 cm ( 15 in ) wide , and 7 @.@ 6 cm ( 3 @.@ 0 in ) thick . 
 Most headstone[MASK] are inscribed with a cross , except for [MASK][MASK]ose deceased known to be atheist or non @-@ Christian . In the case of burials of Victoria Cross [MASK]r George Cross recipients , t[MASK]e regimental badge is supplemented by[MASK]the V[MASK]ctoria Cross or George Cross emble[MASK] . Sometimes a soldier employed[MASK]a pseudonym because they were too young to serve or were sought by law enforcement ;[MASK]in such cases their primary nam[MASK] is show[MASK] along with the notation " served as " . Many [MASK]eadstones are for unidentified casualties ; th[MASK]y consequently bear only what could be discovered from the body . The epitaph , dev[MASK]loped by Rudyard Kipling , that appears on the gr[MASK]ves of unidentified soldiers [MASK]or which no details are known is " A Soldier of the Great War kno[MASK]n unto [MASK]od " . Some headstones bear the text " believed to be buried in this cemetery " when the[MASK] ar[MASK] believed to [MASK]e buried in the cemetery but the ex[MASK]ct location of the grave is not kno[MASK]n . In some cases soldiers were buried i[MASK] collective graves an[MASK] distinguishing one body from [MASK]nother was not possible an[MASK] thus one headstone covers more than one grave . The headstone does not denote any specific details of the death [MASK]xcept for its date , and eve[MASK] then only [MASK]f it is k[MASK]own , and are deliberately ambiguous about the cause of death . 
 Due to local conditions it was sometimes necessary[MASK]for the Commission[MASK]t[MASK] deviate from its standard design . In places prone to extreme weather or earthquakes , such as Tha[MASK]land and Turkey , stone @-@ faced pedestal markers are used instead of the n[MASK][MASK]mal headstones . These measures are intended to prevent masonry being damaged during earthquakes or sinking into sodden ground . In Italy headstones were carved from Chiampo Perla limestone because it was in more plentiful sup[MASK]ly . In Struma Military C[MASK]metery , in Greece , to avoid risk of earthquake damage , small hea[MASK]stones are laid flat on the ground . The smaller size of the markers mean that they of[MASK]en lack unit insignia . 
 
 = = = = [MASK]orticulture = = = = 
 
 Commission cemeteries are distinctive in treating flor[MASK]culture[MASK]as an integral part of the cemetery design .[MASK]Originally , the horticultural concept was to create an env[MASK][MASK]onment where visitors could experience a sense of peace in a setting , in contrast to traditionally bleak graveyards . Recom[MASK]endations given by Arthur William Hill , the Assistant Director of the[MASK]Royal Botanical Gardens at Kew enable[MASK] the Commission to develop cemetery layouts and architectural structure[MASK] that took into accoun[MASK] the placement of suitable plant life . Combining [MASK]tructura[MASK] and hor[MASK]icultural elements was not unfamil[MASK]ar to the Co[MASK]mis[MASK]ion 's architects . Sir Edwin Lutyens furthered his long[MASK]@-@ standing working relationship with horticulturist Gertrude Jekyll , whose devotion to tradi[MASK]ional cottage garden plants and roses greatly influenced the appearance of the cemeteries[MASK]. Where possible , indigenous plan[MASK]s wer[MASK] utilised to enhance sentimental associations with the gardens o[MASK] home . 
 Variety in texture [MASK] height a[MASK]d timing of floral display were equ[MASK]lly important horticultural considerations . The beds around each headstone are planted with a mix[MASK]u[MASK]e of floribunda [MASK]oses and herbaceous perennials . Low @-@ growing plants a[MASK]e chosen for areas immediately in front of headstones , ensuring that inscriptions are not obscured and preventing soil from splashing back during r[MASK]in . In cemeteries where there are pedestal grave markers , dwarf varieties of plants are used instead . 
 The absence of any form of paving between the headston[MASK] rows contributes to the simplicity of the cemetery designs . Lawn paths add to the garden ambiance ,[MASK]and are irrigated during the dry seaso[MASK] in countries where there is insufficient rain . Where irrigation is inappro[MASK]riate or impractical , dry landscaping is an ecological alternative favoured [MASK]y the Commission 's horticulturists , as is the case in Iraq . Dri[MASK]r areas require a different approach not only for lawns , but also to plants and styles of[MASK]planting . Similarly , there are separate horticu[MASK]tural consideration[MASK] in tropical climates . When many cemeteries are concentrated within a limited area , like al[MASK]ng the[MASK]Western Front or Gallipoli peninsula , mobile teams of gardeners operate from a local base . Elsewhere , larger cemeteries have their own dedicated staff while small cemeteries are usually tended by a single gardener working part @[MASK]@[MASK]time .[MASK]

 Immediately following the First World War , the British Army remained responsible for the exhumation of remains . The Western Front was divided into sectors and combed for bodies by 12 @-@ man exhumation units . Between the Armistice and September 1921 , the exhum[MASK]tion units reburied 204 @,@ [MASK]95 bodies[MASK]. After 192[MASK] , no fu[MASK]ther widespread search for[MASK]bodies was undertaken and in Febr[MASK]ary 1921 responsibility of the cemeteries was[MASK]transferred to the Commission . Despite the rigorous searches , bodies continued to be discovered in numbers . In the three years following the conclusion of the general search 38 @,@ 000 bodies were discovered . In the mid 1920s , 20 to 30 bodies were bein[MASK] discovered weekly . 
 The discovery of remains of First and Second World War casualties remains a common occurrence with approximately 30 bodies discovered annually . For example , in 2006 [MASK]ight bo[MASK][MASK]es of Canadian soldiers from the 78th Battalion ( Winnipeg Grenadiers ) , CEF were discovered in a backyard in Hallu , France . In April 2013 , the remains of four British soldiers discovered by a F[MASK]ench farmer clearing land w[MASK]th metal detector in 2009 were re [MASK]-@ interred at H.A.C. Cemetery near Arras , France . In March 2014 , the remains of 20 Commonwealth and 30 German soldiers[MASK]were discovered in Vendin @-@ le @-@ Vieil , France with the Commonwealth soldiers being subsequently reburied at Lo[MASK]s Britis[MASK] Cemetery[MASK]. 
 When th[MASK] remains of a Commonwealth[MASK]soldier from the First or Second World War is discovered the Commission is notified and a [MASK]ommission burial officer tries to col[MASK]ect any associated artifacts that may help in identify the remains . The details are then registered and archived at the Commission 's headquar[MASK]ers. the collection of evidence[MASK]can include artifacts with the remains , anthropological data and DNA . The archival records of the commission are open to the public to permit individuals to conduct their own research . Investigation of archival records by members of the public periodically result in the ide[MASK]tification of previously buried casualties . In December 2013 , it was discovered[MASK]that Second Lieutenant Philip Frederick Cormack , who was previ[MASK]usly commemorated on the Arras Flying Services Memorial , had in fact been buried in a French military cemetery[MASK]in Machelen , East @-@ Flanders in Belgium . Sergeant Leonard Mai[MASK]ment [MASK]as identified in 2013 after a vi[MASK]itor to Marf[MASK]ux British Cemeter[MASK] [MASK]iscovered a headstone of an unknown sergeant with the Hampshire Regiment killed on 20 July 1918 and was subsequently able to show that only one serge[MASK]nt from that reg[MASK]ment had bee[MASK] killed in France on that date . 
 
 = = = Vandalism = = = 
 
 Cemeteries , including those of war dead , are targets for vandali[MASK]m . The gravestones , cemeteries[MASK]and buildings of the Commission are no exception . The Commission believes that graffiti and damage to [MASK]tonework are usuall[MASK] the pursuits partaken by young people , noting the number of incidents in[MASK]reases when schoolchildren are on school holidays . Determined thieves will also steal [MASK]he bronze swords off the Cross of Sacrifice , which are now replaced with identical ones made in fibreglass . 
 [MASK]h[MASK] vandalism of Commission cemeteries has also been connected to the participation of Common[MASK]ealth countries i[MASK] contemporary conflicts . In the 1970s , in The Troubles ,[MASK]Com[MASK]ission cemeteries in Ireland experienced vandalism . Vandals defaced th[MASK] central memorial of the Étaples Military Cemetery in northern France with anti @-@ [MASK]ritish a[MASK]d anti @-@ [MASK]merican graffiti on 20 March 2003 immediately after the beginning of t[MASK]e [MASK]raq War . On 9 May 2004 , thirty[MASK]@-@ three headstones were demolish[MASK]d in the Gaza cemetery , which contains 3 @,@ 691 graves , allegedly in retaliation for the Abu Ghra[MASK]b prisoner abuse scandal . On 24 February 2012 ,[MASK]during the Libyan Civil War , an Islamist militia damaged over 200 headstones i[MASK] the Beng[MASK]azi war cemetery as well as the central memorial . 
 
 
 = Tatwine = 
 
 Tatwine or Tatwin ( Ta[MASK]uini or[MASK]Tadwinus ; [MASK] . 670 – 734 ) was the tenth Archbishop of Canterbury from 731 to 734 . Prior to becoming archbishop , he was a[MASK]monk and abbot of a Benedictine monastery . Besides his ecclesiastical career , Tatwine was a writer , and riddles he composed survive . Another work[MASK]he compose[MASK] was on the grammar of the Latin language , which was aimed at advanced stude[MASK]ts of that l[MASK]ngua[MASK]e . He was subsequently [MASK]onsidered a s[MASK]int . 
 
 = = Biography = = 
 
 Tatwine was a Mercian by birth . His epigraph at Canterbury stated tha[MASK] when he died he was in old age , so p[MASK]rhaps he was b[MASK]rn around 670 . He became a monk at the monastery at Breedon @-@ on @-@ the @-@ Hill in the [MASK]resent @-@ day County of Leicestershire , and then abbot of that house . Through the influence of King[MASK]Æthelbald he was appointed as Archbishop of Canterbury in 731 and w[MASK]s consecrated on 10 June 731 . He was one of a nu[MASK]ber of Mercians who were appointed to Canterbury d[MASK]ring the 730s and 740s . Apart from[MASK]his consecration of the Bishops of Lindsey and Selsey in 733 , Tatwine 's period as archbishop appears to have been uneventful . He died in office on 30 July 7[MASK]4 . Later considered a saint , his feast day is 30 July .

 B[MASK]de 's commentary on Tatwine calls him a " vir religione et Prudentia insignis , sacris quoque literis nobiliter instructus " ( a man notable for his prudence , devotion and learning ) . These q[MASK]alities were displayed in the two[MASK]surviving manuscripts of his riddles and f[MASK]ur of his Ars Tatuini [MASK] The Ars is one of only two surviving 8th @-@ century Lati[MASK] grammars from England , and was based on the works of [MASK]riscian and Consentius . The riddles deal with such diverse [MASK]opics as philosophy and charity , the fiv[MASK] senses and[MASK]the alphabet , and a book and a pen . The riddles are forme[MASK] i[MASK] acrostics . T[MASK]e grammar [MASK]s a reworking of Donatus 's Ars [MASK]inor [MASK]ith the addition of infor[MASK]ation drawn from other g[MASK]ammarians . It was not designed for a newcomer to the Latin language , but is designed [MASK]o[MASK] more adv[MASK]nced studen[MASK]s . It cover[MASK] the eight parts of speech through i[MASK]lustrations drawn from classica[MASK] scholars , although not directl[MASK] bu[MASK] through other grammatical works . There are also some examples drawn from the Psa[MASK]m[MASK] . The work was completed before he became archbi[MASK]hop , and was used not only in Engla[MASK]d but also on the continent . A recent edition of his works is Tatuini Op[MASK]ra omnia , published in 1968 with some translations into English and German from the original Latin .

The group[MASK]is some[MASK]imes known as the UB @-@ 1 class after SM UB @-@ 1 , the class leader . In the Austro @-@ Hungarian Navy , it was called the U @-@[MASK]10 class . 
 Built to me[MASK]t the need for small maneuverable submarines able[MASK]to operate [MASK]n the narrow ,[MASK]shallow seas off Flanders , the vessels were intended to be qui[MASK]kly constructed , then shippe[MASK] by rail and assembled at their port of operation[MASK]. The design effort began in mid @-@ August 1914 and by mid @-[MASK] October the first 15[MASK]boats were ordered from two German sh[MASK]pyards . The German Impe[MASK]ial Navy subsequentl[MASK] ordered an additional pair of boats to replace tw[MASK] so[MASK]d to Austria @-@ Hungary , who ordered a further three boats in April 1915 . A to[MASK]al of 20 UB Is were b[MASK]ilt . Construction of the first boats[MASK]for Germany began in early November 1914 ; all 20 were completed by October 1915 . Several of the first boats u[MASK]derwent trials in Germ[MASK]n home waters , but the [MASK]est were assembled and tested at either Antwerp or[MASK]Pola . The German boa[MASK]s operated primarily in the Flan[MASK]ers , Baltic , and Constantinople Flotillas . The boats were about 28 metres ( 92 ft ) long and displaced 127 tonnes ( 125 long tons ) when surfaced and 142 tonnes ( 140 long tons ) while submerged . All had two bow torpedo tubes and two torpedoes , and were eq[MASK]ipped with a deck @-@ mounted machine gun . 
 In 1918 four [MASK]f the surviving German boats were converted into coastal minelayers . Of the seventeen boats in German service , two were sold to Austria [MASK]-@ Hungary[MASK],[MASK]one was sold to Bulgaria , and nine were lost during the war . One[MASK]of the five Austro @-@ H[MASK]ngarian boats w[MASK]s sun[MASK] and another mined and not repaired . The five surviving German boats , the four survivi[MASK]g Austro @-@ Hungarian boats , and the Bulgarian boat were all turned over to the Allies after the end of the war and were broken u[MASK] .

[MASK]In the earliest stages of the First World War the [MASK]erman Army 's rapid a[MASK]vance along the North S[MASK]a coast found the[MASK]German I[MASK]perial Navy [MASK]ithout submarines suitable to operate in the narrow and shallow seas off Flanders . By 18 August 1914 , two weeks after the German invasion of Belgium , the planning of a series of small coastal submarines had already begun . 
 The Germ[MASK]n Imperial Navy stipulated that the submarines[MASK]must be transportable by rail , which imposed a maximum diameter of 3 @.@ 15 metres ( 10 ft 4 in ) . The rushed planning effort — which had been assigned the name " Project 3[MASK] " — resulted in the Type UB I design , created specifically for operation from Flanders . The boats were to be about 28 metres ( 92 ft ) long and to displace about 125 tonnes ( 123 long tons ) with two bow torpedo [MASK]ubes[MASK]. 
 Boats[MASK]of the Ty[MASK]e UB I design were built by two manufacturers , Germaniawerft of K[MASK]el and AG[MASK]Weser of Br[MASK]men , whic[MASK] led to some var[MASK]ations in boats from the tw[MASK] shipyards . The eight Germaniawerft[MASK]@-@ built boats were slightly longer at 28 @.@ 10 metres ( [MASK]2 ft 2 in ) length overall , while the twelve Weser @-@ bui[MASK]t boats came in 22 centimetres ( 8 @.@ 7 in ) shorter than t[MASK]eir counterparts . All were 3 @.@ 15 metres ( 10 ft 4 in ) abeam and had a draft of 3 @.@ 03 metres ( 9 ft 11 in ) . The boat[MASK] all displ[MASK]ced 127 tonnes ( 125 [MASK]ong tons ) while surfaced , but differed slightly in displace[MASK]ent submerged . The slightly longer Germaniawerft boats displaced 142 tonnes ( 140[MASK]long tons )[MASK][MASK]hile submerged , as they weighed 1 tonne ( 0 @.@ 98 long tons ) more than the Weser boats . 
 The drivetrain of the boats consisted of a single propeller shaft driven by a Daimler ( Germaniawerft ) or Körting ( [MASK]eser ) diesel engin[MASK] on the[MASK]s[MASK]rface , or a Siemens @-@ Schuckert electric motor for underwater travel . The Weser boats were capable of nearly 7 @.@ 5 knots ( 13 @.@ 9 km / h ; 8 @.@ 6 mph ) on the surface and a little more than 6 knots ( 11 km / h ; 6 @.@ 9 mph ) submerged . The Ge[MASK]maniawerft boats were about 1 knot ([MASK]1 @.@ 9 km / h ; 1 @.@ [MASK] mph ) slo[MASK]er than their Bremen @-@ mad[MASK] counterparts . The boats were equipped with two 45 @-@ centimetre ( 17 @.@ 7 in ) bow torpedo tubes and carried two torpedoes .[MASK]They were also armed with a[MASK][MASK]ingle 8 @-@ millimetre ( 0 @.@ 3[MASK] in ) machine gun affixed to the deck .

 The German Imperial Navy ordere[MASK] its first fifteen Type UB I boats on [MASK]5 October 1914 . Eight boats — numbered UB @-@ 1 to [MASK]B @-@ 8 — were ordered f[MASK]om Germaniawerft of Kiel , and seven boats — numbere[MASK] UB [MASK]-@ 9 to U @-@ 15 — from AG Weser of Bremen . After two of [MASK]he class[MASK], UB @-@[MASK]1 and UB @-@ 15 , were sold in February 1915 to ally Austr[MASK]a @-@ Hungary ( becomi[MASK]g U @-@ 10 and U @-@ 11 in the Austro @-@ Hungarian Navy ) , the German Imperi[MASK]l Navy ordered UB @-@ 16 and UB @-@ 17 from Weser . A fur[MASK]her three for Austria @-@ Hungary — U @-@ 15 , U [MASK]-@ 16 , and U @-@ 17 — had been orde[MASK]ed from Weser by April , bringing the total number constructed to 20 . 
 UB @-@ 1 and UB @-@ 2 were laid down on 1 November 1914 at the Germaniawerft yard at [MASK]iel . UB @-@ 1 was launched on 22 January 1915 , just 75 workin[MASK] days later . UB @-@ 2 's launch followed on 13 [MASK]ebruary . Among the Weser boats , UB @-@[MASK]9 was laid down first , on 6 November 1914 , and launched on 6 February 1915 , a week ahead of U[MASK] @-@ 2 . These first three b[MASK]ats launched underwent trials i[MASK] home waters , but most of the other members of the class were shipped via rail and underwent trials at their assembly point . 
 The process of shipping the subma[MASK]ines by rail involved brea[MASK]ing the submarines d[MASK]wn into what was essentially a knock down kit . Each boat was broken into approximately fif[MASK]een pieces and loaded on to eight railway [MASK]latcars . Type UB I boats destined for service with t[MASK]e Flanders Flotilla made a five @[MASK]@ day journey to Antwerp for the two[MASK][MASK]to thr[MASK]e @-@ week assembly process . A[MASK]ter assembly at Antwerp the boats were towed [MASK]y[MASK]barge to Bruges for trials . Boats selected for service in the Medite[MASK]ranean were sent to the[MASK]Austro @-@ Hungarian port of Pola for assembly . The total time from departure of the railcars from the shipyard t[MASK] operational readiness for the boats was about six weeks . 
 By July 1915 all seventeen of the German Imperial Navy Type UB Is had been completed .

 During their trials the Type [MASK]B Is were found to be too small and too slow and had a reputation for being underpowered ; on[MASK] commander comp[MASK]red his Type UB I to a " s[MASK]wing machine " . According to authors R. H. Gibson and Maurice Prendergast in their 1931 book The German Submarine [MASK]ar , 1914 – 1918 , the UBs did not have enoug[MASK] power to chase d[MASK]wn steamers while surfaced and lacked the endurance to spend any [MASK]xtended amount of time underwater , ex[MASK]austing their batteries after little over a[MASK] hour 's running . In @-@ service use revealed another problem : with a single propeller shaft / engine combination , if either component [MASK]aile[MASK] [MASK] the U @-@ boat was almost tot[MASK]lly disabled . 
 Another reported problem with the[MASK]Type UB Is was the tendency to break trim after the firing of torpedoes . The boats were equipped with compensating tanks des[MASK]gned to flood and offset[MASK]the loss of the C[MASK]/ 06 torp[MASK]do 's 1[MASK]@,@[MASK]700 @-@ pound ( 770 kg ) weight , but this system did not always function pro[MASK]erly ; as a result , when firing from perisc[MASK]pe depth the boat could b[MASK]oach after firing or , if too much weight was t[MASK]ken on , plunge to the depths . When UB @-@ 15 torpedoed and sank Italian submarine Medusa in June 1915 , the tank failed to[MASK]properly compensate , forcing the entire crew to run to the stern to offset the trim imbalance . 
 Despite the problems , the " tin tadpoles " , as the Germans referred to them , were in active service from March 1[MASK]15 through the end of the war , with half of the 20 boats lost during the war . Boats of the class s[MASK]rve[MASK] in [MASK][MASK]ree navies : the Ge[MASK]man Imperial Navy , the Austro @-@ Hungarian Navy , and the Bulgari[MASK]n Navy . In German service , they served primarily in the Flanders Flotilla , the Baltic Flot[MASK]lla , and the Co[MASK]st[MASK]nti[MASK]ople Flotilla .

 The first Type UB I to enter service was UB @-@ 10 , which formed the nucleus of [MASK]he Flanders Flotilla , o[MASK] 27 March 1915 . By the end of April five more Type UB I boats had become operational . UB [MASK]-@ 10 w[MASK]s eventually joined in the Flanders Floti[MASK]la by UB @-@[MASK]2[MASK], UB @-@ 4 , UB @-@ 5 , UB @-@ 6 ,[MASK]UB @-@ 12 , UB @-@ 13 , UB[MASK]@-@ 16 , and UB [MASK]-@ 17 ; of these , only UB @-@ 2 made the journey to Flander[MASK] by sea rather than rail . 
 UB @-@ 4 departed on the first patr[MASK]l from Flanders on 9 April , and was responsible for sinking the first shi[MASK] sent down by the flotilla [MASK] The Type UB I boats of the Flanders Floti[MASK]la originally patrolled the are[MASK] between the United Kingdom and the Netherlands , but began patrolling the English[MASK]Channel after UB @-@ 6 pioneered a route past British antisubmarine nets and m[MASK]nes in the Straits of Dover in late June . 
 Over the Type UB Is ' first year of se[MASK]vice , UB @-@ 4 and U[MASK] @-@ [MASK]3 were both lost , [MASK]nd UB @-@[MASK]2 and UB @-@ 5 were transferred to[MASK]the B[MASK]ltic Flotilla . In M[MASK]rch 1917 , UB @-@ [MASK] ran aground in Dutch w[MASK]ters and was interned for the rest of the war , along with her crew . [MASK]he four remaining Type UB Is in Flanders — UB @-@ 10 , UB @-@ 12 , UB @-@ 16 , UB @-@ 17 — were all converted to minelayers by 1918 , hav[MASK]ng their [MASK]orped[MASK] t[MASK]bes removed and replaced with chut[MASK]s to carry up to eight mines . Al[MASK] but UB @-@ 10 were[MASK]lost in 1918 ; UB @-@ 10 , in [MASK]oor repair and o[MASK]t of servi[MASK]e , was scuttled in October 1918 when[MASK]the Germans evacuated from Flanders .

 The three Type UB I boats of the Constan[MASK]inople Flotilla seem to have patrolled primarily in the Black Sea . UB @-@ 8 was transferred to the Bulgarian Navy in May 1916 , and UB @-@ 7 [MASK]isappeared in t[MASK]e Black Sea in October 1916 , leaving UB @-@ 14 as the sole remaining German Type[MASK]UB I in the flotilla ; she was surrendered at Sevastopol in November 1[MASK]18 to French armies[MASK]stationed there d[MASK]ring the Russian Civil War .

 [MASK] UB @-@ 1 and the still incomplete UB @-@ 15 were sold to the Austria @-@ Hu[MASK]gary in February 1915 ; both were dismantled and shipped to Pola[MASK]in May .

 = Military history of Gibraltar during World War II =[MASK]
 
[MASK]The mil[MASK]tary history of Gibraltar during World War II exemplifi[MASK]s Gibraltar 's position [MASK]s a British fortress since the early 18th century and as a vital [MASK]actor in British military strategy , both as a foothold on the [MASK]ontinent of Europe , and as a bastion of British sea power . [MASK]uring World War II , Gibraltar served a vital role in both the Atlantic Theatre and the Mediterranean [MASK]heatre , controlling virtually all naval traffic into and out of the Mediterranean Sea from the Atlantic Oc[MASK]an . 
 In addition [MASK]o its c[MASK]mmanding position , [MASK]ibraltar provided a strongly defended harbour from which ships could operate in both the Atlantic and the Mediterranea[MASK] . Force H ,[MASK]under the command of Vice @-@ Admiral James Som[MASK]rville was based in Gibraltar and had the task of maintaining naval su[MASK]eriority and providing a strong escort for convoys to and from the besieg[MASK]d island of Malta . During the course of the war , Gibralta[MASK] came under aerial bombardment [MASK]rom V[MASK]chy French aircraft and from aircraft of the Italian Royal Air Force ( Regia Aeronautica ) based on Sardi[MASK]ia . Additionally , the fortress was the focus of u[MASK]derwater attacks by the Italian Royal Navy ( Regia Marina ) commando frogman un[MASK]t ( Decima Flottiglia MAS ) and their human torpedoes . This Italian unit was based on the interned Italian ship SS Olterra [MASK]n the [MASK]earby Spanish harbour of Algeciras . A [MASK]umber [MASK]f attacks were also carried [MASK]ut by Spanish and Gibraltarian agents acting on behalf of the German Abwehr . 
 Inside [MASK]he Rock of Gibraltar itself , miles of tunnels were excavated from the limestone . Masses of r[MASK]ck were blasted out to b[MASK]ild an [MASK] under[MASK]round city " . In huge man @-@ made caverns , barracks , offices , and a fully equipped hospital were c[MASK]nstructed , complete with an operating theatre and X @-@ r[MASK]y equipment . 
 Operation Torch , the Allie[MASK] invasion of [MASK]r[MASK]nch North Africa in No[MASK]ember 1942 , was coordinated fro[MASK] the " Rock " . General Dwight D. Eisenhow[MASK]r , who was given command of the operation , set up his headquarters in Gibraltar during the planning phases of the operat[MASK]on . Following the successful c[MASK]mpletion of the North A[MASK]rican campaign and the surrender of Italy in 1943 , Gibraltar 's role shifted from a forward [MASK]peratin[MASK] base to a rear @-@ a[MASK]ea supply position . The harbour continued to operate dry docks and supply depots for the convoy routes through the Mediterranean until V @-@ E Day in 1945 . 
 
 = = Prelude and evacuation = = 
 
 World War II dramatically changed the [MASK]ives of [MASK]ibraltarians . The decision to enforce mass evacuation in order to increase the strength of the Ro[MASK]k with more military and naval personnel meant that most Gibraltarians ( s[MASK]me for up to ten years ) had nowhere to call ' home ' . O[MASK]ly [MASK]hose civilians with essential jobs were [MASK]l[MASK]owed to stay but it gave the entir[MASK] community a sense of being ' British ' by sharing in the war effort . 
 In early June[MASK]1940[MASK], about 13 @,@ 50[MASK] evacuees were shipped to Casablanca in French Morocco . However , following the[MASK]capitulati[MASK]n of the French to[MASK]the[MASK]German armies later in[MASK]June 1940 , the new Pro @-@ German French Vichy Government found the p[MASK]esence of Gibraltarian evacuees in Casablanca an embarrassment and sough[MASK] opportunities for their removal . The opportunity soon arose when 15 British cargo vessels arrived under Commodore Crichton , repatriating 15 @,@ 000 French servicemen who had been rescued from Dunkirk . Once their own rescu[MASK]d serv[MASK]cemen had disembarked , the ships were interned[MASK]until they agr[MASK]ed to take away all the ev[MASK]cuees . Although Crichton was unable to[MASK]obtain permission to clean and restock his sh[MASK]ps ( and contrary to British Admiralty orders which forbade the taking on of evacuees ) , when he saw the mass of civilians pouring through the dockyar[MASK]s , he opened up his gangways for boarding . Just beforehand , the British fleet had destro[MASK]ed a number of Frenc[MASK] warships at Mers el @-@ Kebir in order to[MASK]prevent them ending up in German hands . The attack , during which 1 @,@ 297 French sailors died ,[MASK]led to high tensions , which were evident when families were forced at bayone[MASK] point by French troops to board taking only what they could ca[MASK]ry , leaving many possessions b[MASK]hind . However , when they arrived at Gibraltar , the Governor would not allow them to land , fearing that once the e[MASK]acuees were back on the Rock , it would[MASK]be virtually impossible to evacuate them a second time . Crowds gathered in John[MASK]Mackintosh Square in the centre of [MASK]ibraltar as the news broke[MASK], speeches were made and two City Councillors accompanied by the Acti[MASK]g President of the Exchange and Commercial Library went to see the Governor ( Sir Clive Li[MASK]dell ) to ask that the evacuees be allowed to land . After receiving instructions from London , a landing was allowed [MASK]s long as the evacuees returned when other ships arrived to take them away from the Rock , and by 13 July the re @-@ evacuation back to Gibraltar had been comple[MASK]ed . 
 British conservative politician Oliver Stanley agreed to accept the evacuees in the[MASK]United Kingdom , but he argued with Gibraltar over the number of people involved . The Governor , he declared , had given the number of evacuees first as 13 @,@ 000 , then as 14 @,@ 000 and finally as 16 @,@ 000 . He asked for the situation to [MASK]e clarified , stressing the shortage of accommodation in Britain and insisting that only 13 @,@ 000 could be accepted , 2 @,@ 000 of whom were to be sent to the Port[MASK]g[MASK]ese Atlantic island of Madeira . The situation , replied General Liddell on 19 July , " is that this is a fortress liable to heavy and immediate attack and there should be[MASK]no civilians here whereas there are 22 @,@ 000 . The 13 @[MASK]@ 000 was the num[MASK]er sent t[MASK] Morocco , and more would have been sent ha[MASK] th[MASK] situation there not altered . " In London the evacuees were placed in the hands of the Ministry of Health , and many were [MASK]oused i[MASK] Ke[MASK]sington area . Concern for them in Gibraltar mounted as the air raids against London intensified , coupled with the arrival of harrowing le[MASK]ters , describing the circumstanc[MASK]s in which the evacuees were living . 
 In Septem[MASK]er rumours were already circulating among the evacuees ,[MASK]and in Gibraltar , th[MASK]t the possibility o[MASK] re @-@ evacuating the Gibr[MASK]ltarians once more was being mooted , this time the destination being Jamaica , in the West Indies . After much contention , it was decided to send a party directly[MASK]from Gibraltar to t[MASK]e island , and 1 @,@ 093 evacuees left for Jamaica direct , on 9 October , with more following later on . However petitions followed and the demands were met , partly for s[MASK]rategic reasons and the lack of available shipping . The sit[MASK]ation at the end of 1940 , therefore , [MASK]as that [MASK]ppro[MASK]imately 2 @,@ 000 evacuees were in Jam[MASK]ica and a lesser number in [MASK]adeira , wit[MASK] [MASK]he bulk of around 10 @,@ 000 housed in the London a[MASK]ea .

 On 18 July 1940 , af[MASK]er the attack on the French Fleet [MASK]t Mers @-@ el @-@ Kébir by the British , the Vichy [MASK]overnment authorized a bombing raid of Gibraltar as a response . Little dama[MASK]e was reported to have been done . 
 On Tuesday , 24 September , the Italian Stefani news agency reported : " As a reprisal for the bombardment of Dakar yesterday morning , one @-@[MASK]hundred @-@[MASK]and @-@ twenty French aircraft based in Morocco attacked Gibraltar . " On the same day , the [MASK]nited Press Agency reported : " The French government has i[MASK]sued an official denial of reports ,[MASK]according to which French ai[MASK]craft were said to have a[MASK]tacked Gibraltar . Up until now , no reprisals have been undertaken .[MASK]" But the United Press report ended on a[MASK] ominous note with : " French [MASK]eprisals are imminent . " 
 Again , on the same day , the Vi[MASK]hy French go[MASK]ernment issued orders[MASK]for the naval base and city of Gibraltar t[MASK] be bombarded . As a result , six bomber squadrons of the Vichy F[MASK]ench Air Force ( Armée de l 'Air de Vichy ) and four squadrons of the Vichy French Navy ( Marine nationale de Vichy ) were employed in the operation . The 64 bombers f[MASK]ew from bases in Oran , Tafaroui ( in Algeria )[MASK], Meknes , Mediouna , and Port Lyautey ( in Morocco ) . The [MASK]rench action was approved by both the German A[MASK]mistice Commissio[MASK] [MASK]nd the Italian [MASK]rmistice Commission . 
 No British aircraft wer[MASK] encountered and much damage was done in the area south o[MASK] the fortress . The South Mole and a large ship in the harbour were heavily damaged . In the northern part of Gibraltar , fires broke out . 
 On 25 September , the French returned[MASK][MASK]ith a larger force of eighty @-@ three bomber[MASK] to cause additional damage to the naval base and harbour installations . A[MASK]ain [MASK] aircraft of the British Roya[MASK] A[MASK]r Force made no appearance . However , the French crews did report encountering heavy anti @-@ aircraft fire .

 The Rock came through the wa[MASK] relatively unscathed but , given its strategic importance , Germany made p[MASK]ans t[MASK] c[MASK]pture Gibraltar . [MASK]odenamed " Felix " , the plan whi[MASK]h was signed b[MASK] Adolf Hitler himself was formulated at the highes[MASK] level[MASK]of command . With or without permission ,[MASK]Germany would take entry through Spain and attack Gibr[MASK]ltar driving the British out of the Western Mediterranean . The S[MASK]rait would[MASK]be effectively closed to the Allies onc[MASK][MASK]Gibraltar was in German hands , forcing Asia @-@ bound A[MASK]lied shipping to steam all the way around Afri[MASK]a rather than to pr[MASK]ceed to the east via the shorter ro[MASK]te through the Me[MASK]iterranean and the Suez Canal . The Rock was to be heavily dive bombed by planes leaving Fran[MASK]e but landing afterward at Spanish ai[MASK][MASK]bases . To deny a possible Spanish capture of the [MASK]ase , the German planners decided that the final attack to seize Gibraltar was to be made by German troops alone . 
 Diplomatic[MASK]failure at the highest levels of government prevented the operation from occurring at the beginning of 19[MASK]1 which had been drawn up i[MASK] detail by the Wehrma[MASK]ht in the summer and autumn of 1940 [MASK] 
 Gener[MASK]l Ludwig Kübler 's XLIX Corps would conduct t[MASK]e actual attack on the Rock . The assault forces would comprise the Infantry [MASK]e[MASK]iment Großdeutschland , the 98th Regiment of the 1st M[MASK]untain Divis[MASK]on , 26 medium and heavy artillery battalions , three observation battalions , three engineer battalions , two smoke battalions , a[MASK]detachment of 150 Brandenburgers , and up to 150 min[MASK][MASK]ture remote controlled demolition vehicles ( Goliaths ) , packed with hig[MASK] explosives .[MASK]
 [MASK]s part of a combined @-@ force operation , the German Air Force ( Luftwaffe ) would contribute Ju 88As , [MASK]tukas , Messerschmitts , three light AA battalio[MASK]s , and three heavy AA battalions . Nazi Germany 's Kriegsmarin[MASK] would cooperate by usi[MASK]g U @-[MASK] boats to interfere [MASK]ith British naval movement and emplacing coastal batteries to [MASK]urther discourage [MASK]he Royal Navy . 
 On 10 March 1941 , w[MASK]th Operation Barbarossa looming , Felix was amended to Operation Felix @-@ Heinrich , whereby German tro[MASK]p[MASK] would be withdrawn f[MASK]om the USSR to capture Gibraltar . As a result of Spanish dictator Francisco Franco 's i[MASK]transigen[MASK]e [MASK] the operation was postponed , modified , and ultimately abandoned . 
 
 = = Italian bombing of Gibraltar = = 
 
 From Sardinia , Italian Piaggio P.108 bombers attacked Gibraltar several times , [MASK]ainly in 1942 . The last raids on Gibraltar were done during the [MASK]943 Allied landing in Algeria , when those bombers hit [MASK]uccessfully even the Oran port . 
 The only uni[MASK] of the Regia Aeronau[MASK]ica ( Royal Air Force ) ever to fly the Piaggio P.10[MASK] was the " 274th Long @-@ Range Bombardment Squadron " . This unit was fo[MASK]med in May 1941 around the first machines that came off the assembly lines . The training of the cre[MASK]s lasted far longer than a[MASK]ticipated and only in J[MASK]ne[MASK]1942 the 274th became[MASK]operational . [MASK]he most specta[MASK]ular raids with the P. 108 bombe[MASK]s were flown in October 1942 when several nig[MASK]t attacks again[MASK]t Gibraltar were undertaken from Sardinia . 
 After[MASK]the armistice of Cassibile ( 8 S[MASK]ptember ) , the German @-@ allied Italian Social Republic[MASK]launched at least two raids on Gibraltar : one on the night of 4 – 5 June 1944 with ten SM.79bis aircraft and [MASK]nother on 6 June with nin[MASK] aircraft . Both sorties were undertaken by the Gruppo Aerosiluranti " Buscaglia – Faggioni " .

 Known as the " Floating Trojan Horse of Gibraltar " , [MASK]ecima Flottiglia [MASK]AS , an Italian commando frogman unit created during the Fascist government , engaged in numerous attacks against the harbour at Gibraltar . 
 Gibraltar was a very tempting t[MASK]rget for the Italians[MASK], who[MASK]saw it as a refuge for British warships and allied merchant shipping[MASK][MASK] The Italian frogmen originally used a Spanish villa ( Villa Carmela ) loc[MASK]ted t[MASK]o miles ( 3 km ) from Gibr[MASK]ltar owned by an Itali[MASK]n officer who ha[MASK] m[MASK]rried a Span[MASK]sh woman named Conchita Ramognino .

 = = Abwehr saboteurs fro[MASK] Spain = = 
 
 Lesser known than[MASK]the I[MASK]al[MASK]an actions were the sabotage operation[MASK] and limpet @-@ mine attacks carried out by Spanish and Gibraltarian a[MASK]ent[MASK] recruited in the Campo de Gibraltar by [MASK]he Germans . The Abwehr contacted a Spanish staff officer from Campo de Gibraltar , Lieut[MASK]nant Colonel Eleuterio Sánchez Rubio , a Sp[MASK]nish officer , member of the Falange and coordinator of the intelligence operations in the Campo , to est[MASK]blish a network of saboteur[MASK] with access t[MASK] Gib[MASK]altar . Sánchez Rubio designated Emilio Plazas Tejera , also a member of Falange , as operations chief of the organisation . M[MASK]st of the recruits for the sabotage operations were Spaniards [MASK]rom the Campo [MASK] A combina[MASK]ion of fina[MASK]cial reward , ideological commitment and some threat[MASK] and intimidation were used to gather a significant number of agents . A[MASK]cording to the British intelligence , there were at least 183 Spaniards and Gibraltarians involve[MASK] in the espionage and sabotage operat[MASK]ons against Gibralta[MASK] . 
 Sabotage operations were ordered from Berlin in the [MASK]ate autumn of 1940 , but actual work did not start un[MASK]il early 1941 . The first operations were unsuccessful . A first attempt to smuggle a bomb into Gibra[MASK]tar was aborted , as the timing device was faulty . In February there was a large explosion in the North Tu[MASK]nel , and in April a bo[MASK]b blew up near the ai[MASK]field . In June 1941 , however , the Br[MASK]tish intelligence foiled a new attempt , by a German agent , t[MASK] attach a mine alongside an Allied [MASK]argo sh[MASK]p . Another attempt failed when Plazas placed a bomb inside an ammunition store but[MASK]was not able to bring the explosive . It was not until 1942 that the operations begun t[MASK] succeed . In January 1942 , two Spanish agents manage to destr[MASK]y two air[MASK]ra[MASK]t at the North Front landing st[MASK]ip . 
 Financed , trained and equipped by the Germans , the saboteurs sank the armed trawler HMT Erin , and d[MASK]str[MASK]yed the auxiliary minesweeper HMT Honju , which resulted in the deaths of six British seamen on 18 January 1942 . Plazas was assisted by the Spanish naval command[MASK]r of Puente Mayorg[MASK] , Manuel Romero Hume , who allowed him to beac[MASK] a rowboa[MASK] t[MASK]ere . The British intelligence was able however to counteract the sabotage operations . In Ma[MASK]ch 1942 , a Gibralt[MASK]r[MASK]an , José Key , one of the most prominent agents working[MASK]fo[MASK] the Germans , responsible for the collection [MASK]f information on military movements for the[MASK]Abwehr was a[MASK]rested and executed in [MASK]and[MASK]worth Prison in la[MASK]e 1942 . By September 1942 , P[MASK]azas , whose activities were closely monitored by the British at that time , re[MASK]igned and left Carlos Calvo , his second in [MASK]ommand , in charge [MASK]f the operations . In late 1942 , the German headquarters in Berlin ordered the sabotage operations being expanded[MASK][MASK] In early 1943 , the arrival of an experienced head of Abwe[MASK]r operations in Spain improved the outreach of the oper[MASK]tions [MASK] 
 In March 1943 an ammunition dump was blown up by Calvo 's agents . The B[MASK]itish ,[MASK]growing suspicious of some of the saboteurs , banned them from entering Gibraltar . This forced the Abwehr to ask Calvo for new pe[MASK]sonnel . A Spaniard working on the Rock , José Martín Muñoz , was responsible for the explosion and fir[MASK] at a large fuel tank at Coaling Island on 30 June[MASK]1943 ; this mission , however , would be the[MASK]first and the[MASK]last for Muñoz , because he was cornered and arrested by British authorities in August , when he tried[MASK]to smuggle a bomb into[MASK]a weapons magazine inside Ragged Staff [MASK]ave . After being sen[MASK]enced[MASK]to death , he was hanged on 11 January 1944 in Gibralt[MASK][MASK] by[MASK]British executioner Albert Pierrepoint . A member of an unrelated Abwehr sabot[MASK]ge network , Luis López Cordón @-@ Cuenca [MASK] also arrested in 1943 ) was executed by Pierrepoint on the same day . Calvo himself was put under arrest by the [MASK]panish p[MASK]lice and neu[MASK]ralized . He would be a free man again in December , when he rejoined the Abwehr in Madrid , under di[MASK]ect orders of Wolfgang Blaum , aka Baumann , head of t[MASK]e s[MASK]botage section[MASK]in Spain . After a Falangist[MASK]attempt agains[MASK] the life of pro @-@ allied General José Enrique Varela , perpetrated by Sánchez Rubio network 's agent Juan [MASK]osé Domínguez and a meeting between Anthony Eden and[MASK]the Spanish ambas[MASK]ador at London , Jacobo Fitz @-@ James Stuart , Abwehr activities around Gibraltar came to an end .

 Operation Tracer was a top @-@ secret British stay @-@ b[MASK]hind spying mission that was only [MASK]o be implemented if Gibraltar was captured by [MASK]he Axis Powers . Six men were to be sea[MASK]ed in a cave and left with only enough [MASK]upplies for a year . The volunteers — two doctors , three signalmen and their leader — would[MASK]run an obser[MASK]ation post with one 12 @-@ inch ( 300 mm ) by 6 @-@ inch ( 150 mm ) slit looking ov[MASK]r the harbour and a concealed outdoor terrace[MASK]over the Mediterranean . Th[MASK] team[MASK]would then wire back all s[MASK]ipping movement[MASK] to the British Admiralty . 
 They were told there would be no way out and anyone who died within the chamber would have to be embalmed and cemented into the brick floor . Only if Germany was defeated within their first year would they be released . 
 As the threat of invasion [MASK]as clear[MASK]y felt in [MASK]ate 1941 , an [MASK]dea for a series of s[MASK]cret obse[MASK]vation posts ( first in Gibraltar and later in other places like Malta and Aden [MASK] was put together under Operation Tracer . 
 Work in Gibraltar began immediately under Commander Ge[MASK]ffrey Birley and his chief engineer Colonel F[MASK]rdham . T[MASK]e site chosen at Lord Airey 's Battery on th[MASK] southern tip of the Rock already had an existing tunnelling scheme for a shelter . Extensive trials of the equipment began in January 1[MASK]42 under the eye[MASK]of MI6 radio expert Colonel Richard Gambier @-@ Parry . Much thought was also given to the type of men needed for such a strange and demanding [MASK]ask . A member of Scott ’[MASK]s ill @-@ fated expedition to the Antarctic , George Murray Lev[MASK]ck was called up as Surgeon[MASK]@-@ Commander to advise on survi[MASK]al techniq[MASK]es . There we[MASK]e practical matters such as diet , exercise , sanitation , and [MASK]lothing to conside[MASK] as well as vital " psychology of the personnel " . The full team was in place by the end of sum[MASK]er 1942 and their [MASK]avern fu[MASK][MASK]y equipped a[MASK]d ready for occupation . A comprehensive manual was prepared on all aspects of the operation and it was considered that similar secret lookout posts should be prepar[MASK]d throug[MASK]out the world i[MASK] the event o[MASK] future wars . However , Operation Tracer was never needed , as Adolf Hitler turned his attention awa[MASK] from Gibraltar and towards the Eastern Front . 
 The [MASK]peration had been clouded in mystery until the discovery of papers at the Public Record Office in Kew UK . Previously in the 1960s , details of the story were [MASK][MASK]ld to a journalist by his intelligence service cont[MASK]ct[MASK] an[MASK] he wrote these up as " Oper[MASK]tion Monkey " , yet fac[MASK]s were very sparse . 
 In 199[MASK] " Stay Behind Cave " ( as it wa[MASK] nicknamed ) was discovered in Gibraltar by the Gibraltar Cavi[MASK]g Group , but no accou[MASK]t was ever obtained from anyone associated with the mission . The discovery came about when the group enco[MASK]ntered a strong gust of wind in a tunnel . Further searching led them to break through a wall into chambers which had never been used and had remained sealed for over 50 years . 
 In November 2006 Jim Crone and Sergeant Major Pete Jackson , senior tunnel guide with the Royal Gibraltar Regiment , met possibly the only member of Operatio[MASK] Tracer[MASK]still alive when they travelled to meet Dr. W. A. Bruce Cooper at his home i[MASK] Eng[MASK]and . Cooper , 92 at the time , provid[MASK]d an opportunity to shed[MASK]light on the operation with his direct involvement in the mission as a [MASK]u[MASK]geon @-@ Lieutenant in the Royal Navy Volunteer Reserve ( RNVR ) .

 Plans for the Allied counter of[MASK]ensive after[MASK]the attack on Pearl Harbor were ongoing by mid @-@ 1942 . An invasion of Europe in 1943 would be unworkable , but the allies could attack t[MASK]e " soft underbelly of Europe " through the Mediterranean , as Prime Minister Winston Churchill put it . Devis[MASK]d by President Fran[MASK]lin Roosevelt an[MASK] Churchill and code named Operation Torch , the plan was to occu[MASK][MASK] French North Africa : Morocco , Algeri[MASK] , and Tunisia . From these French colonies , attacks could be launched that would drive Italy out of the war . 
 In July 1942 , Lieutenant General [MASK][MASK]ight D. Eisenhower was appointed Allied[MASK]Commander @-@ in @-@ Chi[MASK]f of Operation Torch . Churchill placed Gibraltar under the command of General Eisenhower as the temporary headquarters for this , the first large @-@[MASK]scale [MASK]nglo @-@ American operation of the war . He arrived in Gibraltar on 5 November 1942 to take[MASK]o[MASK]er , not just command of Operation Torch itself , but also military command of Gibraltar . 
 General Eisenhower stayed at The Conve[MASK]t , the official Governor 's residence ,[MASK]but his operational headquarters were in a s[MASK]all chamber in a tunnel in the heart of the Rock . In his m[MASK]moirs General[MASK]Eisenhower[MASK]wrote : 
 The subterranean passages under the Rock provided the sole available offic[MASK] space , and i[MASK] the[MASK] was located the signal equipment by which we expecte[MASK] to keep in touch with the commanders of the three assault forces . The eternal darkness of the tunnels was here and there partially [MASK]ierced by fee[MASK]le electric bulbs . Damp , cold[MASK]air in block @-@ long passages was heavy with stagnation and did not noticeably respo[MASK]d to the clattering effort[MASK] of electric fans . Through the arched ceilings came a constant drip , drip , drip o[MASK] surface water [MASK]hat faithfully but drearily ti[MASK]ke[MASK] off the seconds of the interminable , almost unendurable , wait which always occurs between completion of a military plan and the m[MASK]ment actio[MASK] begins . 
 One hundred thousand soldiers on [MASK]h[MASK] high seas in a mu[MASK]titude of transports converged on Gibraltar . More than 400 aircraft of all types [MASK]ere crammed into t[MASK]e dispersa[MASK] areas aroun[MASK] [MASK]he Gibraltar runway . Fighters had [MASK]een shipped in crates[MASK]and assembled on th[MASK] airfiel[MASK] . Every available are[MASK] of stora[MASK]e was taken up with ammunition , fuel , and other essential supplies . 168[MASK]American pilots were housed in the RAF messe[MASK] at North Fro[MASK]t . 
 On 8 [MASK]ovember 1942 , 466 aircraft from Gibraltar la[MASK]ded on captured North African airfields . 
 From their h[MASK]adquarters in Gibraltar , General Eisenhower and Admiral Sir Andre[MASK] B[MASK]owne Cunningham directed Operation Torch , the first major combined[MASK]combat operation during World War II involving American and British forces .

 Given that Gibraltar was a small town with only a few defences protecting[MASK]it , the solution was to build a massive series of [MASK]unnels and chambers inside the natural protection of the Rock of Gibraltar . This " town " inside the Rock conta[MASK]ned its own power stati[MASK]n , water supply , and [MASK]ospital . Some soldiers posted here would[MASK]not see the light of day for months on end . Two Canadian engineer companies , the only soldiers with diamond @-@ tipped drills and 5 British engineer companies , added some 30 miles ( 48 km ) of such tunnels , a feat thought impossible at the time .

 = Nerva[MASK]= 
 
 Nerva ( Latin : Marcus Cocceius Nerva C[MASK]esar Augustus ; 8 November , 30 AD – 27 Januar[MASK] , 98 AD ) was Roman Empe[MASK]or from 96 to 98 . Nerva became Emperor at the age[MASK]of sixty @-@ five , after a lifetime o[MASK] imperial service under Nero and the rulers of the Flavian dy[MASK]asty . Under Nero , [MASK]e was a member of the imperial entourage an[MASK] pl[MASK]yed a vital p[MASK]r[MASK] in exposing the Pisoni[MASK]n conspiracy of 65 . Later , as a loyalist to the Flavians , he attained consulships in 71 and 90 during the reigns of Vespasian and [MASK]omitian respectivel[MASK] . 
[MASK]On 18 September 96 , Domitian was assassinated in a palace conspiracy[MASK]involving members of the Praetorian Guard and several of his fre[MASK]dmen . On the [MASK]ame day [MASK] Nerva was declared emperor by the Roman Senate . This was the first time the Senate elected a Roman Emperor . As the new ruler of the Roman Empire , he vowed to restore liberties which [MASK]ad been cur[MASK]ailed during the autocrati[MASK] government of[MASK]Domitian . 
 Nerva 's brief reign was marred by financial difficulties and his inability to assert his authority over the Roman army . A revolt by the Praetorian Guard in October 97 e[MASK][MASK]entially forced him to adopt an heir . After some [MASK]eliberati[MASK]n Nerva adopted Trajan , a young and popular general , as his successor . After barely fifteen months in office , Nerva died of na[MASK]ural c[MASK]uses on [MASK]7 January 98 . Upon his death he was [MASK]ucceeded and deified by Trajan . 
 Although much of his life remains obscure , [MASK]erva was considered a wise and m[MASK]derate emperor by ancient historians . Nerva 's greatest succes[MASK] was his abili[MASK]y to ensure a peaceful transition of [MASK]ower after his death , thus [MASK]oundi[MASK][MASK] the Nerva – [MASK]ntonine dynasty . 
 
 = = Early career = = 
 
 
 = = = Family = = = 
 
 Marcus Cocceius Nerva was born in the village of Narni , 50 kilometers north of Rome , to the fa[MASK]ily of Marcus Cocceius Nerva , Suffect Consul in 40 , and Sergia Plautilla . Ancient sources report the date as either 30[MASK]or 35 . He had at least one attested s[MASK]ster , named [MASK]occeia[MASK], who married Lucius Salvius Titianus Otho , the brother of the future Emperor Otho . 
 Like Vespasian , the founder of the Flavia[MASK] dynast[MASK] , Nerva was a member of the Italian nobility rather than one of the elite of Rome . Nevertheless , the Cocceii were am[MASK]ng the most esteemed and prominent p[MASK]liti[MASK]al families of the late Republic and early Empire [MASK] attaining consu[MASK]ships in e[MASK]ch suc[MASK]essive generation . The direct an[MASK]estors of Nerva on his father 's side[MASK], all named Marcus Cocceius Nerva , were associated with imperial circles since the time of Emperor Augustus ( 27 BC – [MASK]D 14 ) . 
 His great @-@ grandfather w[MASK]s Consul in 36 BC ( in repl[MASK]cement , and abdicated ) , and Governor of[MASK]Asia in the same year . Hi[MASK] grandfa[MASK]her became Consul Suffect in J[MASK]ly of eithe[MASK] 21 or 22 , and was known as a personal friend of Emperor Tiberius ( AD 14 – 37 ) , accompanying the emperor during his voluntary seclusion on Capri from 23 onwards , dying in 33 . Nerva 's father , finally , attained the consulship in 40 u[MASK]der emperor Caligula ( 37 – 41 ) . The Cocceii were connected with the Julio @-@ Claudian dynasty through the marriage of Sergia Plautilla 's brother Octavius Laenas , and Rubellia Bassa , the great @-@ granddaughter [MASK]f Tiberi[MASK]s . 
 
 = = = Im[MASK]erial service = = = 
 
 [MASK]ot much of Nerva 's early life or career is recorded , but it appears he did not pursue the usual administrative or military career . He was praetor @-@ elect in the year 65 and ,[MASK]like his ancestors , moved in imperial circles as a skilled diplomat and strategist . As an advi[MASK]or to Emperor Nero , he successfully helped detect and expose the Pisonian conspiracy of 65 . Exactly what his contribution to the investigation was is not known but his services must have been considerable , since they earn[MASK]d him re[MASK]ards equal to those of Nero 's guard prefect [MASK]igellinus . He received triumphal ho[MASK]ors — which w[MASK][MASK] [MASK]sually reserved for military victories — and the right to have his s[MASK]atues placed throughout the palace . 
 According to the contemporary poet Martial , Ner[MASK] also held Nerva 's literary abilities in high esteem , hailing him as the " Tibullus of our time " . Another prominent[MASK]member of Ner[MASK] 's entourage was Vespasian , an old and r[MASK]spected general who had celebrated military triumphs during the 40s . It appears Vespasian[MASK]befriended Nerva during his time as an imperial advisor , and may have asked him to watch over Ves[MASK]asian 's youngest son Domitian when Vespasian departed for the Jewish war in 67 . 
 The suicide of Nero on 9 June 68 brought the Julio @-@ Claudian dyn[MASK]sty to an end , lea[MASK]ing to [MASK]he chaotic Year of the Four Emperors , which saw the successive rise and fall of[MASK]t[MASK]e emp[MASK]rors Galba [MASK] Otho and Vitellius , until the accession of Vespasian on 21 December 69 . Virtually nothing is known of Nerva 's whereabouts during 69 , but despite the fact that Otho was his brother @-@ in @-@ law , he appears[MASK]to have be[MASK]n one of the earliest a[MASK]d strongest supporters of the Flavians . 
 For services unknown[MASK], he was[MASK]rewarded with a consulship early in Vespasia[MASK] 's rei[MASK]n in 71 . This was a remarkable honour[MASK], not only be[MASK]aus[MASK] he held this office early und[MASK]r the new regime , but also because it was an ordinary consulship ( instead of a less prestigious [MASK]uffect co[MASK]sulship ) , making him one of the few non @-@ Flavians to be honoured in this way under Ves[MASK]asian . After 71 Nerva [MASK]gain disappears from historical record , presumably continuing his career as an inconspicuous advisor under Vespasi[MASK]n ( 69 – 79 ) and his sons Titus ( 79 – 81 ) and Do[MASK]itian ( 8[MASK] – 96 ) . 
 He re @-@ emerges during the revolt of Saturni[MASK]us in 89 . On 1 January , 89 , the governor of Germania Superior , Lucius Antonius Saturninus , and his two legions at Mainz , Legio XIV Gemina and Legio XXI Rapax , revolted against the Roman Empir[MASK] with the aid of a tribe of the Chatti . The governor of Germania Inferior , Lappius Maximus , moved to the region at once , assisted by the procurator of Rhaetia , Titus [MASK]lavius Nor[MASK]anu[MASK] [MASK][MASK]Within twenty @-@ four days the rebellion wa[MASK] crushed , and its leaders at Mainz savagely punished . The mutinous legions were sen[MASK] to the front of Illyricum , while those who had assisted in their defeat were duly[MASK]rewarded . 
 Domitian opened the year fol[MASK]owing the revolt by sharing [MASK]he [MASK]onsulsh[MASK]p with Nerva . Again , the honour suggested Nerva had played a part in unc[MASK]vering the conspiracy , perhaps in a fashion similar to what he did during the Pisonian conspir[MASK]cy under Nero . Alter[MASK]atively , Domitian m[MASK]y have selec[MASK]ed Nerva[MASK]as his colleague to em[MASK]hasise the st[MASK]bility and status @-@ quo of the regime .

 On 18 September , 96 , Domitian was assassinated in a palace conspiracy org[MASK]nise[MASK] by court officials . The Fasti Ostienses , the Ostian Calendar , re[MASK]ords that the same day the Senate[MASK]proclaimed Marcus Cocceius Nerva emperor . Despite his political experience[MASK], this was a remarkable choice . Nerva was ol[MASK] and childless , and had spent much of his [MASK]areer out of the [MASK]ublic light , prompting both[MASK]ancient and modern authors to speculate on his involvement in Domitian[MASK]'s assassination . 
 According to Cassius Dio , the conspir[MASK]to[MASK]s [MASK]pproached Nerva as a potential successor prior to the assassination , which indicates that he was at least aware of the plot . Suetonius by contrast does no[MASK] mention Nerva , but he may have omitted his role out of tactfulness . Considering the wo[MASK]ks of Suetonius were published under Nerva 's direct[MASK]descendants Trajan and Hadrian , it would hav[MASK] been [MASK]ess than sensitiv[MASK] of him to suggest the dynasty owed its accession to murder . On the other hand , Nerva lac[MASK]ed widespread support in the Empire , and as a kn[MASK]wn Flavian loy[MASK]list his tr[MASK]ck record would not have recommended him to the conspirators . The precise facts have been obscured by hi[MASK]tory , but modern historians believe N[MASK]rva was p[MASK]oclaimed Emperor solely on the initiative of t[MASK]e Senate , within hours after the news of the assassination broke . 
 Although he appeared to be an unlikely c[MASK]ndidate on account of his age and weak health , Nerva was considered a safe choice [MASK]recisely because[MASK]he was [MASK]ld and childless . Furthermore , he had close connections with the F[MASK]avian dynasty and command[MASK]d the respect of a substantial part of the Senate . Nerva ha[MASK] seen the anarchy [MASK]hich had resulted from the death of Nero ; he knew that to hesitate even for a few hours could lead to violent civil conflict . [MASK]ather than dec[MASK]ine the invitation and risk revolts , he[MASK]accepted . The decision may have been hasty so as to[MASK]avoid civil war , but neither the Senate n[MASK]r Nerva appears to have been involve[MASK] in the conspiracy against Domitian . 
 Following the [MASK]ccess[MASK]on of Nerva as emperor , the Senate passed damnatio memoriae on D[MASK]mitian [MASK] his coins and statues were melted , his arches were torn down and his name was erased from all public records . In many instances , existing portraits of Domitia[MASK] , such as those found on the Cancelleria Reliefs , were simply recarved [MASK]o fit t[MASK]e likeness of Nerva . Thi[MASK] allo[MASK]ed quic[MASK] prod[MASK]ction of new images and recycling of previous material . In addition , the vast palac[MASK] which Do[MASK]itian had erected on the Palatine[MASK]Hill , known as the Flavian Palace , was[MASK]renamed the " House of the People " , and Nerva himself to[MASK]k up residence in Ves[MASK]asian 's former villa in the Gardens of Sallust . 
 
 = = = Administration = = = 
 
 [MASK]he change of government was welcome particularly to the senators , who had been harshly perse[MASK]uted duri[MASK]g Domitian 's reign . As an immediate gesture of goodwill towards his supporters , Nerva [MASK]ublicly swore that no senators would be put to death as long as he r[MASK]mained in office . He called an end to trials based on treason , release[MASK][MASK]thos[MASK][MASK]who had been[MASK]imprisoned under these[MASK]charges , and granted amnesty to many who had been exiled . 
 All proper[MASK]ies which[MASK]had been confiscated by Domi[MASK]ian were returned to their respective f[MASK]milies . Nerva also sought to involve the Senate in his government , but this was not entirely successful . He continued to rely largely on friends and advisors that were known and trusted [MASK] and by maintaining friendly relations with the pro @-@ Domitianic faction of the Sena[MASK]e , he incurred hostility which may have been the cause for at least one conspiracy against his life . 
 Having been proclaimed emperor solely on the initiative of the Senate , Nerva ha[MASK] to introduce a number of measures to gain support among the Roman popu[MASK]ace . As was custom by this time , a change of emperor was expected to bring with it a generous[MASK]payment of gifts and money to the people and the army . Accordingly , a congiarium of 75[MASK]denarii per head was bestowed upon th[MASK] citizens , while the soldiers of the Praetorian Guard received a donativum which may have amounted[MASK]to as much as 5000 denarii per person . This was followed by [MASK] string of economic reforms intended to alleviate the burden of taxa[MASK]ion [MASK]rom the most needy[MASK]Rom[MASK]ns . 
 To the p[MASK]orest [MASK] Nerva gran[MASK]ed allotments of land worth up to 60 million sesterces . He exempted parents and their child[MASK]en from a 5 % inheritance tax , and he made loans to Italian landowners on the [MASK]ondition that they pay interest of 5 % to their mun[MASK]cipality to support the children of needy families ; alimentary schemes which were later expanded by Trajan , Antoninus Pius , and Marcus Aurel[MASK]us . Furthermore , numerous taxes were remitted and privileges granted to Roman provinces . Namel[MASK] , he probably abolished the Fiscus Iudaicus , the[MASK]additional tax which all Jews thr[MASK]ughout the Empire had to pay [MASK] some of his coins bear the legend FISCI IUDAICI CALUMNIA SUBLATA ( abolition of malicious prosecution regarding[MASK]the Jewish tax ) . 
 Before long , Nerva 's expenses strained the[MASK]economy of Rome and , although perhaps n[MASK]t ruinous to the ext[MASK]nt once suggested by Syme , necessitated the formation of a special commission of econom[MASK] to drastically reduce ex[MASK]enditures . The most superfluous religious sacrifices , games and horse [MASK]aces were abolished , while new income was generated from Domitian 's former possessions , including the auctioning of ships , estates , and even furniture . L[MASK]rge amounts of money wer[MASK] obtained from Domitian 's silver[MASK]and gold s[MASK]a[MASK]ues , and Nerva forbade that similar images be made in his honor . 
 Because he reigned only briefly , Nerva[MASK]'s public works were [MASK]ew , instead completing projects whic[MASK] had been initi[MASK]ted under Flavian rule . This included extensive repairs to the Roman road system and the expansi[MASK]n of the aqueducts . The latter program was headed by the former consul Sextus Julius Frontinus , who helped to put an end to abuses and later published a sign[MASK]ficant work on Rome 's water supply , De Aquis Urbis Romae . The onl[MASK] major landmarks constructed under Nerva were a gra[MASK]ary , known as the Horrea Nervae , and a small [MASK]mperial Forum begun by Domitian [MASK] which linked t[MASK]e Forum o[MASK] Augustus to [MASK]he Temple of Peace . Little remains , partly because the [MASK]ia dei Fori Imperiali cuts across it .

 Despite Nerva 's measures to remain popular with the Senate and the Roman people [MASK] support for Do[MASK]it[MASK]an remained strong in th[MASK] army , which had called for his deification immediat[MASK]ly[MASK]after the assassin[MASK]tion . In an attempt to appease the soldiers of the Praetorian Guard , Nerva had dism[MASK]ssed their prefect Titus Petr[MASK]nius Secundus — one of the chief conspirators against Domitian — and replaced him with a former comm[MASK]nder , Casperius Aelianus . 
 Likewise , [MASK]he genero[MASK]s donativum bestowed [MASK]pon the [MASK]oldiers following his accession was expected to swiftly silence any protests against the [MASK]iole[MASK]t r[MASK]gime change . The Praetorians considered these measures insufficient , however , and demanded the execu[MASK]ion of Domitian 's assassins , which Nerva refused . Continued dissatisfaction with t[MASK]is state of affairs would ultimat[MASK]ly lead to the gravest crisis of Nerva 's reign . 
 While the swift transfer of power following Domitian 's death had prevented a civil[MASK]war from eruptin[MASK] , Nerva 's position as an emperor soon proved too vulnerable , an[MASK] his benign nature [MASK]urned into a reluctance[MASK]to assert his authority . Upon his accession , he had ordered a halt t[MASK] treason trials , but at the same time allowed the prosecution of informers by the Senate to continue . T[MASK]is mea[MASK]ure led to chaos , as everyone acted in his own interests while trying to settle[MASK][MASK]cores with persona[MASK] enemies , leading the consul [MASK]ronto to famously remark that Domitian 's tyranny was ultimately preferable to Nerva 's ana[MASK]chy . Early in 97 , a conspiracy led by the senator Gaius Calpurnius Piso Crassus Frugi Licinianus failed , but once ag[MASK]in Nerva refus[MASK]d to put the con[MASK]pirators to death , much to the disapproval of the Senate . 
 The situation was further aggravated by the absence of a c[MASK]ear successor , made more pressing because of Nerva 's old age and sickness . He had no natural children of his own and only di[MASK]tant relatives , who were unsuited for political office . A successor would have to be chosen [MASK]rom among the governors or generals in the Empi[MASK]e [MASK]nd it appears that , by 9[MASK] , Nerva was considering to adopt Marcus Cornelius Nigrinus Curiatius Maternus , the powerful g[MASK]vernor of Syria . This was cover[MASK]ly opposed by those who supported the more popular mil[MASK]tary commander Marcus Ulpius[MASK]Traianus , commonly known as [MASK]rajan , a general of the armies at the German frontier . 
 I[MASK] Oc[MASK]ober [MASK]7 these tensions came to a head when the Praetorian Guard , led by Casperius Aelianus , laid siege to the[MASK]Impe[MASK]ial Palace and too[MASK] Ne[MASK]va host[MASK]ge . He was forced to submit to their dema[MASK]ds , [MASK]greeing to hand over those responsible for Domitian 's death and even giving a speech [MASK]hanking the rebellious Pra[MASK]torians . Tit[MASK]s[MASK]Petronius[MASK]Secundus and Parthenius , Domitian 's former chamberlain , were [MASK]ou[MASK]ht out and killed . Nerva was unharmed in this assault , but his authority was damaged beyond repair . 
 He realized that his position was no longer tenable without the support of an heir who had the approval of both [MASK]he army an[MASK] the people . Shortly thereafter , he announced the adoption of Trajan as his successor , and with this dec[MASK]sion all but abdicated . Trajan was formally bestowed with the title of Caesar and shared the[MASK]consulship with Nerva in 98 : 
 Contrary to the view here popularized by Cassius[MASK]D[MASK]o , [MASK]owever , Nerva had in fact little choice with regard to his successor . Faced with a major crisis , he des[MASK]erate[MASK]y needed the su[MASK]port of a man who co[MASK]ld restore his[MASK]damaged reputation . The only candidate wi[MASK]h sufficient military experience ,[MASK]consular ancestry , and connections was Tra[MASK]an . Likewise , Edward Gibbon 's assertion that Nerva hereby established a tradition of succession through adoption among the Fi[MASK]e Go[MASK]d Emperors has found little support among modern historians . 
 
 = = Death and legacy = = 
 
 On 1 January , 98 , at the start of his fourth consulship[MASK], N[MASK]rva suffered a stroke[MASK]during a priva[MASK]e audience . Shortly thereafter he was struck by a fever and died at his villa in the Gardens of Sallust , on 28[MASK]January . H[MASK] was deified by the [MASK]enate , and his ashes were laid to rest in the Mausoleum of Augustus . 
 Nerva was succeeded without inciden[MASK] by his adopted son Trajan , who was greeted by the[MASK]Roman populace with much enthusiasm . According to Pliny the Younger , Trajan dedicated a temple in honour of Nerva , yet no [MASK]race of [MASK]t has ever been found ; no[MASK] was a commemorati[MASK]e series of coins for the Deified Nerva issued [MASK]ntil ten years after his death . According to Cassius Dio , however , the Guard prefect responsible for th[MASK] mutiny against Nerva , C[MASK][MASK]perius Aelianus , was ' dism[MASK]ssed ' upon Trajan 's [MASK]ccession . 
 Due to the lack of written sources on this period , much of Nerva 's lif[MASK] has remained obscure . The most substantial surviving account of the reign of Nerva was written by the 3rd [MASK]-@ century historian Cassius Dio . His Roma[MASK] History , which spans nearly a millennium , from the arrival of Aenea[MASK] in Italy until the year 229 , was composed more th[MASK]n one hundred years after Ner[MASK]a had died . Further detai[MASK]s are added by an abridged biography from the Epito[MASK]e de Caesaribus , a[MASK]work allege[MASK][MASK]to have been authored by the 4th @-@ century historian Aurelius Victor . 
 A more comprehensive te[MASK]t , presumed to describe the life of Nerva in closer detail , is the Histories[MASK], by the c[MASK]ntemporary hi[MASK]toria[MASK] Tacitus . The His[MASK]ories is an account of the history of Rome c[MASK]vering th[MASK]ee decades[MASK]from the suicide of emperor Nero in 69 until the death of Domitian in 96 . Unfortunately , a substantial part of the work has b[MASK]en l[MASK]st , wit[MASK] only the first five books covering the Year of the Four Emperors remaining . In the introduction to his biography of Gnaeus Julius Agricola however , Tacitus speaks highly of Nerva , describing his reign as " the dawn [MASK]f a most happy age , [ when ] Nerva Caesar bl[MASK]nded things once irreconcilable , sovereignty and freedom [MASK] . 
 The surviving his[MASK]ories sp[MASK]ak equally positively of Nerva 's brief reign , although none offer a substantial commentary on his policies . Both Cassius Dio an[MASK] Aurelius Victor emphasize his wisdom and mo[MASK][MASK]ration , with Dio commending his decis[MASK]on to[MASK]adopt Trajan as his heir . These views were later popularized by the 18th @-@ century historian E[MASK]ward Gibbon in his History of the Decl[MASK]ne and Fall o[MASK] the Roman Empire . Gibbon considered Nerva the first of the Five Good Emperors , five successive rulers under whom the Roman Empire " was governed by absolute powe[MASK] , under the guidance of wisdom and vir[MASK]ue " from 96 until 180 . Neverth[MASK]less , even Gibbon notes that , compared to h[MASK][MASK] successors , Nerva may have lacked the necessary qualifications for a successful reign : 
 Modern history has expanded upon this sentiment , characterizing Nerva as a well @-@ intentioned but weak and ineffectual ruler . The Roman Senate enjoyed renewed liberties under his rule[MASK], but Nerva 's mismanagement of the state finances and lack of authority over[MASK]the army ultimately brought Rome near the edge of a signific[MASK]nt crisis . The mutiny led[MASK]by Casperius Aelianus was never intended as a c[MASK]up , [MASK]ut a cal[MASK]ulated attempt to put pressure on the emperor . The adoption of Trajan expand[MASK]d his power base with a respected , reliable general as his successor . Murison[MASK]concludes that Nerva 's real talents were in fact ill @-@ suited to the emperorship : 
 His pla[MASK]e in Roman history i[MASK] therefore summari[MASK]ed as a necess[MASK]ry , if tum[MASK]ltuous stop @-@ gap b[MASK]fore the Trajanic @-@ [MASK]ntonine dynasties . It is a fact of irony that even the only major pub[MASK]ic work completed during his reign , the Forum of Nerva , ultimat[MASK]ly became known as the Forum Transitorium , or transi[MASK]ional forum . 
 Two modern statues which commemorate Nerva can be found in towns associated with him . There is an equestrian statue in Gloucester , England , a town which was founded in his honour .[MASK]It is a[MASK] the e[MASK]trance to Southgate Street . There is also a statue at his alleged birthplace , Narni in Italy , at Cocceio Nerva street .

 The Hustle[MASK] is a 1961 American drama film directe[MASK] by Robert Rossen from Walter [MASK]evis 's 195[MASK] novel of the same nam[MASK] , adapted[MASK]for the screen by Rossen and Sidney Carroll . It tells the story of small @-@ time pool[MASK]hustler " Fast Eddie " Felson and his desire to break into the " major league " of professional[MASK]hustling and high @-@ stakes wagering by high @-@ rollers th[MASK]t follows it . He throws his[MASK]raw talent and ambition up [MASK]gainst the best player in the country ; seeking to best the legendary pool player " Minnesota F[MASK]ts[MASK]. " After initially losing to Fats and gettin[MASK] involv[MASK]d with unscrupulous manager Bert Gordon , Eddie returns to try again , but only after paying a terrible personal price . 
 The film was shot on location in New York City . It stars Paul Newman as " Fast " Eddie Felson[MASK], Jackie Gleason as Minnesota Fats , Piper Laurie as Sarah , and George C. Scott as Bert . 
 The Hustler was a major critical and popular success , gaining a reputation as a modern classic . Its exploration of winning , losing , and character garnered a number of major awards ; it is also credited with helping to spark a resurg[MASK]nce in the popularity of[MASK]pool . Real @-@ life pool player Rudolf Wanderone , known at the time as " New York Fats " and " Chicago Fats " , claimed to be the real life inspira[MASK]ion for Gleason 's[MASK]charact[MASK]r , Minnesota [MASK]ats , and adopted[MASK]the name as his own .

A[MASK]riving at [MASK]ats ' home pool hall , Eddie declares he will win $ 10 @,@ 000 that night . Fats arrive[MASK] and he and Eddie[MASK]agree to play[MASK]straight pool for $ 200 a game . After initially falling behind , Eddie surges back to being $ 1 @,@ 000 ahead and suggests raising the bet to $ 1 @,@ 000 a ga[MASK]e ; Fats agrees . He se[MASK]ds out a runner , Preacher , to Johnn[MASK] 's Bar , ostensibly fo[MASK] whiskey , but really to get professional gambler Bert Gordon[MASK]to the[MASK]hall . Eddie gets ahead $ 11 @,@ 000 and Charlie tries to convince him to quit , but[MASK]Eddie insists the game will end only when [MASK]ats says it i[MASK] over . Fats [MASK]grees to contin[MASK]e after Bert labe[MASK]s Eddie a " loser . " After 25 hours [MASK]nd an entire bottle of bourbon , Eddie is ahead over $ 18 @,@ 000 , but loses it all along with all but $ 200 of hi[MASK] ori[MASK]inal stake . At their hotel later , Eddie leaves half of th[MASK] remaining stake with a sleeping[MASK]Charlie and leaves . 
 Eddie stashes his belongings at the local bus terminal , where he[MASK]meets Sarah Packard , an alcoholic who is supported by her father , attends college part @-@ time , and walks with a limp . He meets her again at a bar . They go back to[MASK]her place but she refuses to let him in , saying he is " too hungry " . Ed[MASK]ie moves into a roomi[MASK]g house and starts hustling for small stakes . He finds Sarah again and this time she takes him in , but with reservations . Charlie finds Eddie at Sarah 's a[MASK]d tries to persuade him to go back out on the road . Eddie refuses and Charlie realizes he plans to challenge Fats again . Eddie realizes that C[MASK]arlie hel[MASK] out[MASK]his percentage and [MASK]ecomes enraged , believing that with that money he could have rebounded to beat Fats .[MASK]Eddie dismisses Charlie as a scared old man and tel[MASK]s him to " go lie down an[MASK] die " by himself . 
 At Johnny 's Bar , Eddie joins a poker game where Bert is p[MASK]aying , and loses $ 20 . Afterward [MASK] Bert tells Eddie that he has talent as a pool player but no character[MASK]. He figures that Eddie will need at least $ 3 @,@ 000 to challenge Fats again . Bert calls him[MASK]a " born[MASK]l[MASK]ser "[MASK]but nevertheless offers to stake him [MASK]n return for 75 % of his winnings ; Eddie refuses . [MASK] Eddie humiliates a local pool shark , exposing himself as a hustler , and the other players punish him by breaking his thumbs . As he heals , Sarah ca[MASK]es for him and tells him she loves him , but he cannot say the words [MASK]n return . When Eddie is ready to play , he agrees to Bert 's terms , deciding that a " 25 % slice of something big[MASK]is better than a [MASK]00 % slice of nothing " . 
 Bert , Eddie , and Sarah travel to the Kentucky Derby , w[MASK]ere Bert arranges a match for Eddie [MASK]gains[MASK][MASK]a wealthy local socialite named Findley . The game turns out to be carom billiards , not pool[MASK]. When Eddie loses badly , Bert refuses to keep staking him . Sarah[MASK]pleads with Eddie [MASK]o leave with her , saying that the world he is living i[MASK] and its inhabitants are " perverted , twisted , and crippled " ; he refuses .

 The Tevis n[MASK]vel had been option[MASK]d several times , including by Frank Sinatra , but attempts to adapt it for the screen were unsuccessful . Director Rossen 's daughter Carol Rossen speculates that previous adaptations focused too much on the pool aspec[MASK]s of the s[MASK]ory and n[MASK]t enough on the [MASK]uman interaction . Rossen , who had hustled pool himself as a youth and who had made [MASK]n abortive attempt to write a pool @-@ themed play called Corner Pocket , optioned the book and teamed with Sidney Carroll to produce the script . 
 Accord[MASK]ng to Bobby Darin 's a[MASK]ent , Martin Baum , Paul Newman 's age[MASK]t turned down th[MASK] part of Fast Eddie . Newman was origina[MASK]ly unavailable to play Fast Eddie regardless , being committed to star opposite Elizabeth Taylor in the film Two[MASK]for t[MASK]e Seesaw . Rossen off[MASK]red Darin the part after seeing h[MASK]m[MASK]on The Mike Wallace Interview . When Taylor was forced to drop out of Seesaw because of shooting overr[MASK]ns on Cleopatra , Newman was freed [MASK]p to take the role , which he [MASK]ccepted after readi[MASK]g just half of the script . No one ass[MASK]ciated with the production officially notified Darin or his [MASK]epresentatives that he had been repl[MASK]ced ; they found out from a member of the public at a charity horse race . 
 Rossen filmed The Hustler o[MASK]er six weeks , ent[MASK]re[MASK]y in New York City . Much of the action was filmed at two now @-@ defunct pool ha[MASK]ls , McGirr 's and A[MASK]es Billiard Aca[MASK]emy . [MASK]ther shooting locations included a to[MASK]n[MASK]ouse on East 82nd Street , which served as the Louisville home of[MASK]Mur[MASK]ay Hamilton 's character Findley , and the Manhattan Greyhound bus terminal . The film crew built a dinin[MASK] ar[MASK]a that was so realistic that confused passengers sa[MASK] there and waited to place their order[MASK] . Willie Mosconi served as techn[MASK]cal adv[MASK]sor on the film and shot a nu[MASK]ber of the trick shots in place of the actors[MASK]. Al[MASK] of Gleason 's[MASK]shots were his own ; they were filmed in wide @-@ angle to emphasize hav[MASK]ng the actor and the shot in the same frames . Rossen , in pursuit of the [MASK]tyle he termed " neo @-@ [MASK]eo @-@ realistic " , hired actual street thugs , enrolled them in the Screen Actors Guild and used them as extras .[MASK]Scenes that were included in the shooting script but did not make it into the final film include a scene at Ames pool hall establishing that Eddie is on his way t[MASK] t[MASK]wn ( originally slated to be the first scene of the film ) and a longer scene of Preacher talking to [MASK]ert at Johnny 's Bar which estab[MASK][MASK]shes Preacher is a j[MASK]nkie . 
 Early shooting put [MASK]ore focus on the pool playing , b[MASK]t[MASK]during filming Rossen made the decision to place [MASK]ore emphasis on the love story between Newman and Laurie 's characters . [MASK]espite the change in emphasis , Rossen still used the various pool games to show the strengthening of Eddie 's character and the evolution of[MASK]his relationship to Bert and Sarah , through the positio[MASK]ing of the characters in the frame . Fo[MASK] example , when Eddie is playing Findley , Eddie is positio[MASK]ed below Bert in a two shot but above Findley while still below Bert in a three shot . When Sarah enters the room , she is below Eddi[MASK] in two shot w[MASK][MASK]le in a three shot Eddie is still below Bert[MASK]. When Eddie is kneeling over Sarah 's body[MASK], Bert again ap[MASK]ears above him but Eddie attacks Bert , ending up on top of him . Eddie finally appears above [MASK]ert in two [MASK][MASK]ot wh[MASK]n Eddie returns to beat Fats .

 The Hustler is fundament[MASK]lly a story of what it[MASK]means to be a human being , couched within the context of winning a[MASK]d losing . [MASK]escribing the film , Robert Rossen said : " My protagonist , Fast Eddie , wants to become a great pool player , but the film is [MASK]eally about the obstacles he en[MASK]o[MASK]nters in[MASK]att[MASK]mpting to fulfill himself[MASK]as a human being . He [MASK]ttains self @-@ awareness only after a terrible personal tragedy which he h[MASK]s caused — and then he wins his pool game . "[MASK]Roger Ebert concurs with this assessment , citing The Hust[MASK]er as " one of the few American movies in which the h[MASK]ro wins by surrendering , by accepting reality instead of his dreams . " 
 The film was also somewhat autobio[MASK]raphical for Rossen [MASK] relating to his dealings with the House Un @-@ American Activities Commi[MASK]tee . A screenwriter during the 1930s and ' 40s , he had been involved with th[MASK] Communis[MASK] Party in the 1930s and [MASK]efused to name names at his first HUAC appearance . Ultimately he changed his mind and identified friends and colleagues as party members . Simi[MASK]arly , Felson sel[MASK]s his soul an[MASK] betrays th[MASK] one person who really k[MASK]ows and loves him in a Faustian pact to gain character .[MASK]
 Film and theatre historian Ethan Mordden has identified The Hustler as one of a [MASK]andful of films from the early 1960s that re @-@ defined the relationship of films to their audiences . This new relationship , he writes , is " one of [MASK]hallenge rather than flattery , of doubt rather than certainty[MASK]. " No film of the 1950s , Mordden asserts , [MASK] took such a brutal , clear look at the ego @-@ affirmation of the one @-@ on @-@ one contest , at the inhumanity of the winner or the castrated vulnerabili[MASK]y of the loser . " Although some have suggested the resemblance of this film to classic film noir , Mordden rejects the comparison based on Rossen 's ultra @-@ rea[MASK]istic [MASK]tyle , also noting that the film lacks [MASK]oir 's " Treacherous Woman or its r[MASK]lish i[MASK] discovering crime among the bourgeoisie , hungry bank clerks [MASK]nd lusty wives . " Mordden does [MASK]ote[MASK]that while Fas[MASK] Eddie[MASK]" has a slight fif[MASK]ies ring " , [MASK]he chara[MASK]ter " makes a decisive break with the extraordinarily feeling tough guys of the ' re[MASK]el ' era ... [ b ][MASK]ut he does end up seeking out his emotions " and telling Bert that he is a loser because he 's dead inside .

 [MASK]he[MASK]Hustler had its world p[MASK][MASK]miere [MASK]n Wash[MASK]ngton , D.C. on September 25 , 1961 . Prior to the premiere , Richard Burton [MASK]osted a mid[MASK]ight scr[MASK]ening of the film for t[MASK]e casts of t[MASK]e season 's Broadway shows[MASK], which generated a great deal of positive word of mouth . Initially reluctant to publicize the film , 20th Century Fox r[MASK]sponded b[MASK] stepping up its promotional activities . 
 The film was well received by critics , although with the occasional caveat . Va[MASK]iety praised the performances of the entire main cast but felt that the " sordid aspects " of the sto[MASK]y prevented the film from achieving the[MASK]" goal of being pure entertainment . " Variety also felt the film was far too long . Stan[MASK]ey K[MASK]uffmann , writing for The New Republic , concurred in part with this assessment . Kauffmann strongly praised the pri[MASK]cipal cast , calling Newman "[MASK]first @-@ rate " and writing that Scott 's was " his most credible pe[MASK]formance to date . " Laur[MASK]e , he writes , gives her part " movingly anguished touches " [MASK] although he also mildly critici[MASK]es her for over @-@ reliance on Method acting ) . While he found that the [MASK]cript " strains hard to give an [MASK]ir of menace and criminality to the p[MASK]ol[MASK]hall " and also declares it " full of pseudo @-@ meaning " , Kauffmann lauds Rossen[MASK]'s " sure , economical " directi[MASK]n , especially in regard to[MASK]Gleason who , he says , does not so much act as " [ pose ] for a number [MASK]f pictures which are [MASK]ell arranged by Rossen . It is the best use of a manikin by a director sin[MASK]e Kazan photographed Burl Ives as Big Daddy . " The New York Times , despite finding that the fi[MASK]m " stray[MASK] a bit " and that the romance between Newman and Laurie 's characters "[MASK]seems a mite far @-@ fetched " , nonetheless found that The [MASK]ustler [MASK] speaks powerfully in a universal language that spellbinds and reveals bitter truths .

 In the decades since its release , The Hustler has cemented its reputation as a classic . Roger Ebert , echoing e[MASK]rlier praise for the performances , directio[MASK] , and cinema[MASK]ography and adding laurels for editor Dede Allen , cites the film as " one of those films wh[MASK]re scenes have such psychic weight that they grow in our memories . " He furthe[MASK] cites Fast Eddie Felson as one of " only a handful of movie characters so real that the audience refers to them as touchstones . " TV Guide calls the film a " dark stunner " offering " a grim world whose only bright spot i[MASK] the top of the pool table , yet [ with ] characters [ who ] [MASK]ainta[MASK][MASK] a shabby nobility and grace . " The four [MASK]e[MASK]ds are again lavishly praised for their[MASK]perfo[MASK]mances and the fi[MASK]m is summed[MASK][MASK]p as " not to be missed . " 
 Paul Newman reprised his role as Fast Eddi[MASK] Felson in the 1986 f[MASK]lm The Color of Money , for which he won the Academy Award for Best Actor in[MASK]a Leading Role . A number of observers and critics have su[MASK]gested that this Oscar was in belated recognition for[MASK]his performance [MASK]n The Hustler . In 1997 , the [MASK]ibrary of Congress selected The Hustler for preservation[MASK]in the United States National Film Registry as " culturally , historically , or aesthetically significant[MASK]. "[MASK]Carroll and Rossen 's screenplay was selected by the Writers Guild of America in 2006 as the 96th best motion picture screenplay of all time . In June 2008 , A[MASK]I released its " Ten top Ten " — the best ten films in te[MASK] " classic " American film genres — after polling over 1 @,@ 500 people from the creative community . The Hus[MASK]ler was acknowledged as the[MASK]s[MASK]xth best film in the sports genre . 
 The Hustler is credited with sparking a resurgence in the popularity of pool in the United States , which h[MASK]d been on the decline for decades . The film also brought [MASK]ecognition to Willie Mosconi , who , despite having won multiple world champions[MASK][MASK]ps[MASK], was virtually unknown to the general public . Perhap[MASK] [MASK]he greatest beneficiary [MASK]f the film 's pop[MASK]larity was a real @-@ life pool hustler named Rudolf Wand[MASK]rone . Mosconi claimed in an interview at the time of the film 's release that the character of Minnesota Fats was based on Wanderone , who at the time was known as " New [MASK]ork Fatty " . Wanderone immediately adopted the Minnesota Fats nickname [MASK]nd parlayed his association[MASK]with th[MASK] film into book and television deals and other ventures . Auth[MASK]r Walter Tevis denied for the rest of his life that Wan[MASK]erone had played any role in the creation of the character . Other players would claim , with greater or lesser degrees of credibility , to have served as models for Fast E[MASK]die , including Ronnie Allen , Ed Taylor , Ed Parker , and E[MASK]die Pelkey .
