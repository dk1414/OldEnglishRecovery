the academy was specially designed to train commandos and the <num> was originally designed to supervise north korean light infantry ranger units
over the next year the <num> unit received extensive training in unconventional warfare and amphibious warfare
during this time the unit was expanded in size to <num> @,@ <num> men in six battalions
prior to the beginning of the war in june <year> the <num> completed training and was moved to the front at yangyang to support the kpa 's <num> division
the north korean plan was to conduct amphibious landings in chongdongjin and imwonjin on the eastern coast using the <num> regiment in conjunction with the <num> unit
these amphibious landings would harass the rear area of the republic of korea army providing supporting attacks to the planned frontal attack by the kpa 's ii corps directly from the north
the <num> was in position by june <num> and prepared for the attack
the unit was moved to the ports of wonsan and kansong and loaded into ships
with the <num> @,@ <num> men in the <num> another <num> @,@ <num> in the <num> and <num> @,@ <num> men in the kpa 's <num> division the <num> @,@ <num> north korean troops outnumbered the republic of korea army 's rok <num> division 's <num> @,@ <num> by a ratio of <num>
<num> to <num>
the combination of the frontal attack and the landings were expected to crush the rok division and prevent reinforcements from moving in to support it
the regiment was split into three groups for the attack
three battalions acted as spearheads for the <num> division on land while two more battalions conducted the landings in imwonjin
this <num> @,@ <num> man force reassembled and then led the north korean units south
in the meantime the <num> battalion <num> regiment was detached and sent on a mission to infiltrate pusan
paired with additional support it formed the <num> @-@ man <num> unit
<num> unit was tasked with raiding pusan harbor destroying vital facilities to make it impossible for un forces to land troops there
however the troop transport carrying the <num> unit was discovered and sunk by united nations ships outside pusan harbor the morning of june <num> destroying the <num> battalion
three hours later the <num> regiment 's two battalions landed at the village of imwonjin using motor and sail boats to land troops and mustering south korean villagers to assist in setting up supplies
the two battalions separated one headed into the t 'aeback mountains and the second advanced north toward samcheok
at this point the rok <num> division under heavy attack from the front and aware of attacks in the rear urgently requested reinforcements
it was denied these reinforcements as rok higher commanders informed the division commander that the rok army was under heavy attack across the entirety of the <num> parallel and had no reinforcements to spare
the rok 21st regiment <num> division 's southernmost unit moved to counter the amphibious attack
the regiment 's 1st battalion moved from bukp 'yong into the okgye area and ambushed forward elements of the <num> in conjunction with local police and militia forces
they were able to drive back the <num> regiment 's northern advance
however at least one of the <num> regiment 's battalions massed at bamjae blocking one of the <num> division 's main supply routes
rok troops mustered a civilian militia to help fight the north koreans which was only moderately effective
the embattled rok <num> division was forced to withdraw under overwhelming attacks and breakdowns in communication on july <num>
with the retreat of the rok <num> division the entire rok eastern flank was forced back
the <num> regiment had been successful in establishing a bridgehead and disrupting communications in the initial attack
across the entire front the north korean army had successfully routed the south koreans and was pushing them south
the <num> regiment acted as an advance force attempting to infiltrate further inland as it moved through the mountainous eastern region of the country
the rugged terrain of the eastern regions of korea poor communication equipment and unreliable resupply lines thwarted the south korean resistance
the north koreans used this to their advantage in advancing but they began to experience the same problems themselves
the <num> division and the two other units began advancing south slowly and cautiously sending strong reconnaissance parties into the mountains to ensure they would not be threatened from the rear
however this more cautious advance began to give the south koreans valuable time to build up further south
by june <num> the <num> had infiltrated into taebaek @-@ san from uljin and was moving toward ilwolsan yongyang and cheongsong in order to block communications between daegu and busan where united states army forces were landing in an attempt to support the collapsing rok army
the rok <num> regiment of the rok <num> division was moved to block the advance of the three units at uljin
the rok forces mounted a series of delaying actions against the main north korean force which was significantly dispersed throughout the mountainous region and unable to muster its overwhelming strength
the rok regiment was subsequently able to hold up the north korean advance until july <num>
on july <num> the <num> separated from the <num> division and met an advance party of north korean civilians in uljin who had been sent to set up government in the area
from here the <num> dispersed in small groups into the mountains
on july <num> it reached pyonghae @-@ ri <num> miles <num> km north of yongdok
over the next week the <num> regiment and the kpa 's <num> division continued in a slow advance south as it met increasing south korean resistance
united nations air support began to increase slowing the advance further
the force continued to occupy the eastern flank and by july <num> it was advancing from the chongsong @-@ andong region and approaching pohang
on its flank was the kpa 's <num> division
progress halted as un aerial and naval bombardment made movement more difficult
at the same time the north korean units supply lines were stretched thin and began to break down forcing them to conscript south korean civilians to carry supplies
still it was able to surround the rok <num> division in the city
by now the <num> division and the <num> regiment had been reduced to a combined strength of <num> @,@ <num> men to the rok <num> divisions <num> @,@ <num>
the <num> massed its force again to assist the <num> division in surrounding and besieging the rok <num> division which was trapped in the city
the <num> division in the meantime was ordered to remain in the city to delay the north koreans as long as possible
it was eventually evacuated by sea after delaying north korean forces for a considerable time
the rugged terrain of the mountains prevented the north korean forces from conducting the enveloping maneuvers they had used so effectively against other troops and their advantages in numbers and equipment had been negated in the fight
by july <num> the division was still embroiled in this fight and the <num> bypassed it and moved toward chinbo on the left flank of the city
however the <num> had suffered significant setbacks at yongdok with substantial losses due to american and british naval artillery fire
once it arrived in the area it met heavier resistance from south korean police and militia operating in armored vehicles
with air support they offered the heaviest resistance the unit had faced thus far
with the support of only one of the <num> division 's regiments the <num> was unable to sustain its advance and had to pull back by the <num>
movement from the rok capital division prevented the <num> regiment from infiltrating further into the mountains
rok cavalry and civilian police then began isolated counteroffensives against the <num>
these forces included special counter @-@ guerrilla units targeting the <num> and countering its tactics
south korean troops halted the advance of the north koreans again around the end of the month thanks to increased reinforcements and support closer to the pusan perimeter logistics network
on august <num> the kpa 's <num> division pushed back the rok capital division in the ch 'ongsong @-@ kigye area and linked up with elements of the <num> which had infiltrated the area of pohyunsan
unopposed they began to prepare to attack p 'ohang to secure entry into the un 's newly established pusan perimeter
the regiment was ordered to begin an attack in coordination with the kpa 's <num> division
the korean people 's army planned simultaneous offensives across the entire perimeter including a flanking maneuver by the <num> and the <num> division to envelop un troops and push them back to pusan
the <num> was not reinforced north korean planners intended it to move unseen around the un lines while the majority of the un and north korean troops were locked in fighting around taegu and the naktong bulge
by this time however north korean logistics had been stretched to their limit and resupply became increasingly difficult
by the beginning of august the north korean units operating in the area were getting little to no food and ammunition supply instead relying on captured un weapons and foraging for what they could find
they were also exhausted from over a month of advancing though morale remained high among the <num> troops
the <num> regiment specialized in raiding un supply lines and effectively mounted small disruptive attacks against un targets to equip themselves
the village was only protected by a small force of south korean navy air force and army personnel comprising the rear guard of the rok <num> division
the south korean forces engaged the <num> forces around the village 's middle school with small @-@ arms fire until noon
at that point north korean armored vehicles moved in to reinforce the <num> troops and drove the south koreans out of the village
the village was strategically important because it was one of the few direct routes through the mountains and into the gyeongsang plain
it also led directly to the land routes being used by the un to reinforce taegu
upon hearing of the fall of p 'ohang un eighth united states army commander lieutenant general walton walker immediately ordered naval and air bombardment of the village
he also ordered rok and us forces to secure regions around the village to prevent further advance of the north korean troops
within a few hours the village was being blasted by artillery forcing the regiment 's advance force to pull back
the <num> 's forces congregated and fought in the hills around the village
they joined elements of the kpa 's <num> division and did not enter p 'ohang until night
un forces responded to the threat with overwhelming numbers
a large force of south korean troops designated task force p 'ohang was massed and sent into p 'ohang @-@ dong to engage the <num> regiment and the <num> division
rok troops attacked toward an 'gang @-@ ni to the east forcing the kpa 's <num> division into a full retreat
threatened with encirclement the kpa 's <num> division and <num> regiment were ordered into full retreat on august <num>
by this time the <num> had been reduced to <num> @,@ <num> men half its original strength
exhausted and out of supplies the <num> regiment moved to pihak @-@ san a mountain <num> miles <num>
<num> km north of kigye to join the shattered kpa 's <num> division
the <num> division was reduced to <num> @,@ <num> men in the fighting and <num> @,@ <num> army replacements and south korean conscripts were brought to replenish the division
the <num> regiment was also ordered to merge its remaining troops into the depleted kpa 's <num> division
upon the completion of the merger with the <num> division on august <num> <year> the <num> regiment ceased to exist
it had trained for close to <num> months prior to the war but fought for less than two

lewis gilbert originally declined the offer to direct but accepted after producer albert r
broccoli called him saying you can 't give up this job
it 's the largest audience in the world
peter r
hunt who edited the first five bond films believed that gilbert had been contracted by the producers for other work but they found they had to use him
gilbert producers broccoli and harry saltzman production designer ken adam and director of photography freddie young then went to japan spending three weeks searching for locations
spectre ’ s shore fortress headquarters was changed to an extinct volcano after the team learned that the japanese do not build castles by the sea
the group was due to return to the uk on a boac boeing <num> flight boac flight <num> on <num> march <year> but cancelled after being told they had a chance to watch a ninja demonstration
that flight crashed <num> minutes after takeoff killing all on board
in tokyo the crew also found hunt who decided to go on holiday after having his request to direct declined
hunt was invited to direct the second unit for you only live twice and accepted the job
unlike most james bond films featuring various locations around the world almost the entire film is set in one country and several minutes are devoted to an elaborate japanese wedding
this is in keeping with fleming 's original novel which also devoted a number of pages to the discussion of japanese culture
toho studios provided soundstages personnel and the female japanese stars to the producers
bloom 's work was ultimately rejected but since several of his ideas were used in the final script bloom was given the credit of additional story material
among the elements were the opening with bond 's fake death and burial at sea and the ninja attack
as the screenwriter of the previous bond films richard maibaum was unavailable roald dahl a close friend of ian fleming was chosen to write the adaptation despite having no prior experience writing a screenplay except for the uncompleted the bells of hell go ting @-@ a @-@ ling @-@ a @-@ ling
dahl said that the original novel was ian fleming ’ s worst book with no plot in it which would even make a movie and compared it to a travelogue stating that he had to create a new plot though i could retain only four or five of the original story 's ideas
on creating the plot dahl said he didn 't know what the hell bond was going to do despite having to deliver the first draft in six weeks and decided to do a basic plot similar to dr
no
dahl was given a free rein on his script except for the character of bond and the girl formula involving three women for bond to seduce an ally and a henchwoman who both get killed and the main bond girl
while the third involved a character from the book kissy suzuki dahl had to create aki and helga brandt to fulfil the rest
gilbert was mostly collaborative with dahl 's work as the writer declared he not only helped in script conferences but had some good ideas and then left you alone and when you produced the finished thing he shot it
other directors have such an ego that they want to rewrite it and put their own dialogue in and it 's usually disastrous
what i admired so much about lewis gilbert was that he just took the screenplay and shot it
that 's the way to direct you either trust your writer or you don 't
sean connery had stated that he was tired of playing james bond and all of the associated commitment time spent filming and publicising each movie together with finding it difficult to do other work which would potentially lead to typecasting
saltzman and broccoli were able to persuade connery by increasing his fee for the film but geared up to look for a replacement
jan werich was originally cast by producer harry saltzman to play blofeld
upon his arrival at the pinewood set both producer albert r
broccoli and director lewis gilbert felt that he was a poor choice resembling a poor benevolent santa claus
nonetheless in an attempt to make the casting work gilbert continued filming
after several days both gilbert and broccoli determined that werich was not menacing enough and recast blofeld with donald pleasence in the role
pleasence 's ideas for blofeld 's appearance included a hump a limp a beard and a lame hand before he settled on the scar
he found it uncomfortable though because of the glue that attached it to his eye
many european models were tested for helga brandt including german actress eva renzi who passed on the film with german actress karin dor being cast
dor performed the stunt of diving into a pool to depict helga 's demise herself without the use of a double
strangely for the german version dor was dubbed by somebody else
gilbert had chosen tetsurō tamba after working with him in the <num> dawn
a number of actual martial arts experts were hired as the ninjas
the two japanese female parts proved difficult to cast due to most of the actresses tested having limited english
akiko wakabayashi and mie hama were eventually chosen and started taking english classes in the uk
hama initially cast in the role of tanaka 's assistant had difficulty with the language so the producers switched her role with wakabayashi who had been cast as kissy a part with significantly less dialogue
wakabayashi only requested that her character name suki be changed to aki
the film was shot primarily in japan
himeji castle in hyōgo was depicted as tanaka 's ninja training camp
his private transportation hub was filmed at the tokyo metro 's nakano @-@ shimbashi station
as of <year> many of the fixtures in the station are unchanged from the time of filming
the hotel new otani tokyo served as the outside for osato chemicals and the hotel 's gardens were used for scenes of the ninja training
bōnotsu in kagoshima served as the fishing village the kobe harbour was used for the dock fight and mount shinmoe @-@ dake in kyūshū was used for the exteriors of spectre 's headquarters
large crowds were present in japan to see the shooting
a japanese fan began following sean connery with a camera and the police were called several times to prevent invasions during shooting
the heavily armed wa @-@ <num> autogyro little nellie was included after ken adam heard a radio interview with its inventor raf wing commander ken wallis
little nellie was named after music hall star nellie wallace who has a similar surname to its inventor
wallis piloted his invention which was equipped with various mock @-@ up armaments by john stears special effects team during production
nellie 's battle with helicopters proved to be difficult to film
the scenes were initially shot in miyazaki first with takes of the gyrocopter with more than <num> take @-@ offs <num> hours of flight and wallis nearly crashing into the camera several times
a scene filming the helicopters from above created a major downdraft and cameraman john jordan 's foot was severed by the craft 's rotor
the concluding shots involved explosions which the japanese government did not allow in a national park
so the crew moved to torremolinos spain which was found to resemble the japanese landscape
the sets of spectre 's volcano base were constructed at a lot inside pinewood studios with a cost of <num> million and including operative heliport and monorail
the <num> m <num> ft tall set could be seen from <num> kilometres <num> miles away and attracted many people from the region
locations outside japan included using the royal navy frigate hms tenby then in gibraltar for the sea burial hong kong for the scene where bond fakes his death and norway for the soviet radar station
sean connery 's then wife diane cilento did the swimming scenes for at least five japanese actresses including mie hama
martial arts expert donn f
draeger provided martial arts training and also doubled for connery
lewis gilbert 's regular editor thelma connell was originally hired to edit the film
however after her initial almost three @-@ hour cut received a terrible response from test audiences peter r
hunt was asked to re @-@ edit the film
hunt 's cut proved a much greater success and he was awarded the director 's chair on the next film as a result
he tried to incorporate the elegance of the oriental sound with japanese music @-@ inspired tracks
the theme song you only live twice was composed by barry and lyricist leslie bricusse and sung by nancy sinatra after her father frank sinatra passed on the opportunity
nancy sinatra was reported to be very nervous while recording – first she wanted to leave the studio then she claimed to sometimes sound like minnie mouse
barry declared that the final song uses <num> different takes
british singer julie rogers recorded an alternative song for the titles but this was not used
there are two versions of the song you only live twice sung by nancy sinatra one directly from the movie soundtrack and a second one for record release arranged by billy strange
the movie soundtrack song is widely recognised for its striking opening bars and oriental flavour and was far more popular on radio
the record release made no
<num> on the billboard charts in the usa no
<num> in uk
both versions of the title song are available on cd
in <year> acen sampled the title song you only live twice for his song trip ii the moon part <num>
in <year> icelandic singer björk recorded a cover version
in <year> robbie williams used the distinctive string figure for his song millennium although it was re @-@ recorded rather than sampled from the movie for cost reasons
coldplay covered it when they toured in <year> and it was covered by natacha atlas for her <year> compilation album the best of natacha atlas
shirley bassey who has three original bond themes to her credit has also covered the song
a different title song was originally recorded by julie rogers but eventually discarded
only two lines from that version were kept in the final lyrics and the orchestral part was changed to fit nancy sinatra 's vocal range
rogers version only appeared in a james bond <num> anniversary cd with no singer credit
in the <num> an alternative example of a possible theme song also called you only live twice and sung by lorraine chandler was discovered in the vaults of rca records
it became a very popular track with followers of the northern soul scene chandler was well known for her high @-@ quality soul output on rca and can be found on several rca soul compilations
bond first aired on <num> june <year> in the united states on nbc
bond regulars lois maxwell and desmond llewelyn appeared playing respectively miss moneypenny and q
kate o 'mara appears as miss moneypenny 's assistant
the programme shows clips from you only live twice and the then four existing bond films
and contained a storyline of moneypenny trying to establish the identity of bond 's bride
it was the first premiere of a james bond film that queen elizabeth ii attended
the film grossed <num> million in the united states and over <num> million worldwide
critical response today is mostly positive with rotten tomatoes giving a <num> rating
but most reviews pointed out various flaws in the film
james berardinelli said that the first half was good but during the second half as the plot escalates beyond the bounds of preposterousness that the film starts to fragment criticising blofeld 's appearance and stating rockets that swallow up spacecraft are a bit too extravagant
roger ebert criticised the focus on gadgets declaring that the james bond formula fails to work its magic
john brosnan in his book james bond in the cinema compared the film to an episode of thunderbirds with a reliance on gadgetry but admitted it had pace and spectacle
christopher null considered the film one of james bond 's most memorable adventures but the plot protracting and quite confusing
ali barclay of bbc films panned dahl 's script displaying a whole new world of villainy and technology
leo goldsmith lauded the volcano base as the most impressive of ken adam 's sets for the franchise
danny peary wrote that you only live twice should have been about twenty minutes shorter and described it as not a bad bond film but it doesn ’ t compare to its predecessors – the formula had become a little stale
ign ranked you only live twice as the fourth best bond film and entertainment weekly as the second best considering that it pushes the series to the outer edge of coolness
but norman wilner of msn chose it as the fifth worst criticising the plot action scenes and little screentime for blofeld
literary critic paul simpson called the film one of the most colourful of the series and credited the prefecture of kagoshima for adding a good flavour of japanese influence on the film but he panned the depiction of blofeld as a let @-@ down small bald and a whooping scar
simon winder said that the film is perfect for parodies of the series
the planet has a mass of nearly half that of jupiter but a radius five @-@ fourths the size of jupiter
this low relative mass might be caused by a core that is of low mass or that is not present at all
the planet orbits at approximately <num> of the distance between the sun and earth every four days
the star was observed several times between <year> and <year> at first through the superwasp program and later through focused follow @-@ up observations
analysis of collected radial velocity measurements led to the discovery of wasp @-@ 13b which was reported in a journal on april <num> <year>
a follow @-@ up study published in <year> investigated the cause for inflated planets such as wasp @-@ 13b and re @-@ examined and re @-@ constrained its mass radius density and age
photometric follow @-@ up observations were taken on february <num> <year> using the james gregory telescope jgt in scotland which took <num> exposures of the star although the last twenty images taken were obscured by cloud cover and were discarded
using hd <num> as a reference star along with jgt measurements the astronomers investigating the system were able to create a light curve for the transiting planet
wasp @-@ <num> was observed between february <num> and <num> in <year> by the sophie échelle spectrograph at the haute @-@ provence observatory in france determining the radial velocity of the transiting body
use of the fies echelle spectrograph at the nordic optical telescope in the canary islands gained other spectral measurements that yielded the characteristics of the star
analysis of the sophie and fies data were used to constrain some of the orbiting body 's characteristics
the discovery of the orbiting body 's mass using radial velocity measurements led to its confirmation as the planet wasp @-@ 13b
the discovery of wasp @-@ 13b was reported in the journal astronomy and astrophysics by the european southern observatory on may <num> <year>
the discovery paper was received by the journal on april <num> <year>
later between <year> and <year> another team of astronomers observed wasp @-@ 13b and wasp @-@ 21b to find what caused some hot jupiters to have anomalously high radii
the rise photometric camera on the liverpool telescope was used to detect further transits
two partial transits and two full transits were observed during this period although the quality of both full transits was slightly compromised because of passing cloud cover
the collected observations along with the jgt observations that were used to confirm the planet were scaled to filter out errors such as background noise
the data was then used to re @-@ define wasp @-@ 13b 's parameters including its age mass radius and density
the study also noted that a limb darkening effect was present a characteristic that may affect future atmospheric studies of the planet
measurements taken by fies and sophie did not constrain the mass radius or age well however a later <year> study using the liverpool telescope better @-@ constrained those parameters
the star 's mass is estimated at <num>
<num> times the mass of the sun its radius at <num>
<num> times that of the sun and its density at <num>
<num> time 's the sun 's density
these characteristics are re @-@ defined taking limb darkening into account
the star 's metallicity which is measured by iron content is placed roughly at fe h <num> similar to that of the sun
also the star 's estimated effective temperature is <num> k slightly warmer than the sun
wasp @-@ <num> has an apparent magnitude of <num>
<num> making it invisible to the unaided eye as seen from earth
<num> times that of jupiter and a radius that is <num>
<num> times jupiter 's radius
the planet is in other words less than half the mass of jupiter but slightly less than fourteen tenths its size
wasp @-@ 13b 's low mass can mostly likely be attributed to the presence of a low @-@ mass core or to the total lack of a core according to the discovery paper
wasp @-@ 13b which orbits its host star at a distance of <num>
<num> au circles its star completely every <num>
<num> days
the <year> study on the planet recognized wasp @-@ 13b as the fifth lowest @-@ density extrasolar planet known behind kepler @-@ 7b wasp @-@ 17b tres @-@ 4b and corot @-@ 5b
wasp @-@ 13b has an orbital inclination of <num>
9º which means that it orbits almost edge @-@ on as seen from earth
they were the first major artist to hold a concert in the city after the end of the bosnian war
approximately <num> @,@ <num> fans attended the show
the band first became involved with sarajevo in <year> on their zoo tv tour approached by aid worker bill carter about bringing attention to the siege of sarajevo the band conducted nightly satellite transmissions with bosnians during their shows
these link @-@ ups were the subject of criticism from journalists for mixing entertainment with human tragedy
although the war made it impractical for u2 to visit sarajevo at the time they vowed to eventually play a concert in the city
after the conflict ended in november <year> they made arrangements to visit sarajevo and with help from united nations ambassadors and peacekeeping troops they scheduled and played the concert in <year>
the band offered to hold a benefit concert or small show in sarajevo but it was requested that they stage a full popmart concert
the performance consequently featured the tour 's extravagant stage and the band played a set list typical of the tour
the show brought together people of different ethnicities who had previously clashed during the war and train service was temporarily resumed to allow concertgoers to attend
among the songs played was miss sarajevo written by u2 and brian eno about a beauty pageant held during the war
although the band were displeased with their performance and lead vocalist bono had vocal difficulties the concert was well received and was credited with improving morale among bosnians
the members of u2 consider the show to be among their proudest moments
the concert was lauded by bosnians
in <year> croatia and slovenia seceded from yugoslavia
bosnia @-@ herzegovina — a republic with a mixed population consisting of bosniaks serbs and croats — followed suit in march <year> in a highly controversial referendum creating tension in the ethnic communities
bosnian serb militias whose strategic goal was to secede from bosnia and herzegovina and unite with serbia encircled sarajevo with a siege force of <num> @,@ <num> stationed in the surrounding hills from which they assaulted the city with weapons that included artillery mortars tanks anti @-@ aircraft guns heavy machine @-@ guns rocket launchers and aircraft bombs
from <num> may <year> until the end of the war in <year> the city was blockaded
the army of the republic of bosnia and herzegovina numbering roughly <num> @,@ <num> inside the besieged city was poorly equipped and unable to break the siege
meanwhile throughout the country thousands of predominantly bosniak civilians were driven from their homes in a process of ethnic cleansing
in sarajevo women and children attempting to buy food were frequently terrorized by bosnian serb sniper fire
before their <num> july show in verona italy the band received a fax from radio televizija bosne i hercegovina asking for an interview regarding the situation in bosnia
the band agreed and met with an american aid worker named bill carter who acted as the station 's foreign associate due to serbian travel restrictions
carter described his experiences in sarajevo helping bosnians while surviving the dangerous living conditions
lead vocalist bono was unnerved to hear that those living in makeshift bomb shelters in the city played music including u2 's at loud volumes to drown out the sound of explosions
while in sarajevo carter had seen a television interview on mtv in which bono mentioned the theme of the zooropa tour leg was a unified europe
feeling that such an aim was empty if ignoring the bosnians plight carter sought bono 's help
he requested that u2 go to sarajevo to bring attention to the war and break the media fatigue that had occurred from covering the conflict
bono agreed to carter 's request without asking the rest of the band and when informed of the idea the other members gave only tacit approval
they briefly considered playing an impromptu concert in the city with bono suggesting that they perform in the bunker where carter and his friends hid during the siege
he said even if all we get is some extra attention for bosnia on mtv that 's something
the idea fell through when it was pointed out that the logistics of transporting their equipment into the city were impossible as the only way into sarajevo was on a united nations plane
manager paul mcguinness realized that even if the band managed to organize a concert it would endanger their lives and those of the audience and the zoo tv crew
as he explained u2 's effort to discuss any humanitarian issue have sometimes been accompanied by a false instinct that u2 is also obliged to resolve that issue
going to sarajevo seems to me to fall into that category
i think it would endanger the people we go with endanger the tour and endanger the band
drummer larry mullen jr
feared that the move would look like a publicity stunt
instead the group agreed to use the tour 's satellite dish to conduct live video transmissions from their concerts to carter in sarajevo
carter returned to the city and assembled a video unit
the band purchased a satellite dish to be sent to sarajevo and paid a £ <num> @,@ <num> fee to join the european broadcasting union ebu
once set up the band began satellite link @-@ ups to sarajevo on nearly a nightly basis the first of which aired on <num> july <year> in bologna italy
to connect with the ebu satellite carter and two co @-@ workers were forced to visit the sarajevo television station at night and to film with as little light as possible to avoid the attention of snipers and bombers
to reach the building they had to traverse an area known as sniper alley
this was done a total of <num> times over the course of a month
during the broadcasts carter discussed the deteriorating situation in the city and bosnians often spoke to u2 and their audience
these grim interviews starkly contrasted with the rest of the show concerts on the zoo tv tour were elaborately staged multimedia events that satirised television and the audience 's over @-@ stimulation
most of the shows were scripted but the link @-@ ups to sarajevo were not leaving the group unsure who would speak or what they would say
u2 stopped the broadcasts in august <year> after learning that the siege of sarajevo was being reported on the front of many british newspapers
though this trend had begun before the band 's first sarajevo transmission nathan jackson suggested that u2 's actions had brought awareness of the situation to their fans and to the british public indirectly
reactions to the transmissions were mixed
many fans felt the transmissions disrupted the flow of the concerts
most of the british press was highly critical
one writer for nme wrote the bosnian linkup was beyond bad taste
it was insulting
bono thought that they were bringing the public 's attention to an important event though he admitted that the link @-@ ups were the most difficult thing the band had done in their career
guitarist the edge said we don 't normally see that kind of cold hard news
we get a very sanitized editorialized take on everything
when you watch the television news you are getting something palatable whereas this was really quite unpalatable most of the time
and for that reason i think it affected people very much including us
mullen worried that the band were exploiting the bosnians suffering for entertainment
during a transmission from the band 's concert at wembley stadium three women in sarajevo asked what the band intended to do to help before telling bono we know you 're not going to do anything for us
you 're going to go back to a rock show
you 're going to forget that we even exist
and we 're all going to die
during a transmission to a glasgow concert a bosnian woman told the concert audience we would like to hear the music too but we hear only the screams of wounded and tortured people and raped women
some people were upset by the circumstances of sarajevo and were motivated to join the war child charity project including u2 producer brian eno
despite u2 's obligation to the tour and their inability to perform in sarajevo during the war they vowed to play the city someday
the band contributed to bosnian relief efforts to enhance humanitarian and public awareness of the issue and bono and carter subsequently collaborated on the documentary miss sarajevo which showcased the war @-@ torn city during carter 's six months living there
in <year> u2 and eno wrote the song miss sarajevo as a response to the surreal acts of defiance that had taken place during the siege of sarajevo
one such act was a beauty pageant organized by bosnian women who planned to fight the war with their lipstick and heels
during the pageant all of the participants walked onto the stage carrying a banner that said don 't let them kill us
the winner of the pageant <num> @-@ year @-@ old inela nogić later said the pageant was a crazy thing to do during a war
but we tried to live a normal life
it was some kind of a defence mechanism we all had
years later bono said it was pure dada and it deserved to be celebrated in song
of the song 's meaning he said everywhere people had heard their call for help — but help never came
that was the feeling
i had tried to tackle subjects like this head @-@ on but i 'd learnt a lesson
you have to try and make the same points in a different less direct more surrealist way
miss sarajevo was recorded with luciano pavarotti and released as the first single from u2 's side @-@ project with eno entitled original soundtracks <num> the record was released under the pseudonym passengers
realizing this u2 began to plan a concert for sarajevo that would take place on their <year> popmart tour
although they were the first major musical artist to perform in the city following the war china drum had played a concert in july <year>
music journalist andrew mueller described china drum 's experience in a single van as a logistical and administrative nightmare
muhamed sacirbey the bosnian ambassador to the united nations helped u2 make arrangements playing an informal role as promoter and organizer
mcguinness said we thought it was going to be quite difficult
but it 's been quite straightforward
people have just wanted to help
we 've blagged a lot of equipment forklifts and so on from the military and the local crew have been incredibly supportive
scheduling the concert meant a financial loss of £ <num> @,@ <num> for the band despite sponsorship from coca @-@ cola and gsm
ticket prices were set at just dm <num> £ <num> us <num> because of the <num> percent unemployment rate in the city
bono offered for the group to perform a benefit concert or small show in sarajevo but the city requested they hold the full popmart show
bono said we offered to do a charity gig here just turn up and do a scratch gig but they wanted the whole fucking thing
they wanted the lemon mcguinness added we felt it was important that we treat this as another city on the tour to pay them that respect
to come here and not do the whole show would have been rude
according to news releases following the concert the total net income for the show was us <num> @,@ <num> however tour promoter john giddings noted that price did not include the costs of the production or transportation
as late as july <year> u2 were pressured to accept an offer of approximately <num> million to perform in basel switzerland on the date scheduled for the sarajevo show
at the time rumours about the region 's instability persisted
to ensure the sarajevo show was not canceled sacirbey appeared at many of the band 's preceding shows to lobby on behalf of the city
for the stage to reach sarajevo the road crew had to drive the equipment and stage through war @-@ torn bosnia
although the trip was without incident they had to pass through towns such as mostar which had been obliterated during the war
stage and lighting designer willie williams commented that when the truck drivers arrived you could see that they were changed men
the only trouble in transporting the stage came when a border control agent prevented them from crossing the border for hours
the trucks reached sarajevo two days prior to the concert arriving to the cheers and applause of the city 's residents their arrival was the first concrete evidence that the band were keeping their promise to play there
mcguinness explained this is a city that 's been disappointed so many times there were a lot of people who weren 't prepared to believe the gig was going to take place until they saw the stage going up
until then tickets had sold very slowly but within <num> hours of the trucks arrival another <num> @,@ <num> tickets were sold
despite this a day before the concert <num> @,@ <num> tickets remained unsold
three @-@ hundred local residents were employed to help assemble the stage and promote the show
several hundred members of the international stabilisation force sfor were tasked with upholding the dayton agreement for the concert
the band were overwhelmed by the sights they saw when arriving
during the war koševo stadium was used as a morgue and graveyards were present on either sides
although the venue had escaped the worst of the shelling the nearby olympic hall zetra had been badly damaged during the war
despite its condition u2 used the building for their dressing rooms and offices
following the concert it was used to provide lodging for <num> @,@ <num> fans
the band 's hotel a nearby holiday inn had been shelled during the siege and part of the building had been destroyed as a result
the walls in mullen 's room were punctured with mortar shrapnel and sections of the floor were also missing
prior to the show sacirbey took mullen on a tour of the city showing him the sarajevo roses embedded in the streets
on the day of the concert trains ran into sarajevo for the first time since the start of the war
two lines were opened one from mostar to sarajevo and the other from maglaj to sarajevo
although the railways had been functional for the duration of the war muslim and croat politicians could not decide who would operate them
as a result the trains were only run on the date of the concert to bring fans to the city and the day after to take them home again
visa requirements were temporarily suspended
an effort was made to include all of the country 's ethnic groups at the concert
approximately <num> fans crossed the ethnic boundary lines between bosnia 's serb republic and the moslem @-@ croat federation
people from several of the other yugoslavian republics went to sarajevo for the concert with buses carrying fans from zagreb croatia and ljubljana slovenia
security around the event was strict
sfor soldiers searched for bombs with sniffer dogs and the buildings around the stadium were lined with irish troops and sharpshooters in case violence broke out
it was broadcast in bosnia by local television networks as well as globally by bbc
during the event <num> @,@ <num> soldiers stood on the left side of the stadium to ensure no conflicts broke out
at showtime a decision was made to open the stadium gates to all allowing approximately <num> @,@ <num> more fans who could not afford the concert or who had not purchased tickets in time to attend
in addition to the local and foreign fans <num> @,@ <num> off @-@ duty sfor soldiers attended the event in uniform
inela nogić attended the concert and arrived in a limo with the band
the concert was broadcast live internationally on radio and all proceeds from the radio sales were donated to the war child project
three opening acts played before u2 beginning with the gazi huzrev @-@ beg choir an islamic choir from a local high school
their performance was followed by two local bands protest and sikter one of which was chosen personally by sacirbey and the other which was selected through a radio contest
following the opening acts musician howie b performed a dj set before u2 took the stage
the band 's set list was similar to that of most shows on the popmart tour but with sunday bloody sunday in place of the edge 's karaoke segment and the addition of miss sarajevo in the second encore
the night was a celebration of the end of the war with bono setting the tone by shouting out viva sarajevo fuck the past kiss the future at the beginning of even better than the real thing
bono had struggled with his voice throughout the tour and the morning of the concert he woke up without a voice
there was no intent to cancel and the show went ahead as planned
though bono had few difficulties through the opening quartet of mofo i will follow gone and even better than the real thing his voice gave out during last night on earth
in <year> the edge suggested that bono 's vocal troubles had been caused by laryngitis or by the stress of the previous few months of touring though he later remarked that it didn 't really matter that our lead singer was under the weather because every member of the audience seemed to join in on every song
there was a mass chorus for the whole concert
at various points during until the end of the world and new year 's day bono gestured for the audience to help him with the vocals and by the eighth song of the night pride in the name of love he was reduced to speaking the lyrics instead of singing them
the band continued with their standard set list by playing i still haven 't found what i 'm looking for stand by me all i want is you and staring at the sun
u2 considered playing desire after all i want is you but they chose not to perform the song
the edge then performed a solo version of sunday bloody sunday
the rendition was slower and quieter than the studio version
during the song bono went backstage for cortisone injections which helped to improve his voice for a short time
brian eno was prepared to go on stage to replace bono if he could not continue or to sing alongside him
bono ultimately returned to the stage alone for the next song bullet the blue sky and the band continued with renditions of please and where the streets have no name which concluded the main set
in the interlude before the first encore u2 had a worried discussion over the introduction to miss sarajevo
the song had only been played once prior — at a benefit concert in <year> with bono the edge eno and pavarotti
they returned to the stage and played discothèque if you wear that velvet dress with or without you and a rough version of miss sarajevo
pavarotti was not at the concert to sing his part and so an antique gramophone was brought onto the stage in his place
eno came on stage to sing backing vocals and bono invited nogić on stage during the chorus
during the song the video screen showed images from carter 's miss sarajevo documentary including footage of the girls taking part in the beauty contest and the banner reading please don 't let them kill us
bono apologized for the rocky performance at the end of the song saying sarajevo this song was written for you
i hope you like it because we can 't fucking play it
the concert concluded with a second encore of hold me thrill me kiss me kill me mysterious ways one and an abbreviated cover of unchained melody
after the band had walked offstage in a move described by nme as the most meaningful of the concert the audience faced the troops in the stadium and broke into a spontaneous round of applause which quickly turned into an ovation — an act which the soldiers mimicked in turn
in reaction to the event a bosnian student told members of the international press i felt excluded from the world for so long
it 's not only about u2
it 's the feeling of being part of the world
a local resident said that the concert was proof that we have peace here that everything is ok
fans from outside the former yugoslavia described sarajevo as an oasis of light in the midst of destroyed and fire @-@ damaged buildings and deserted villages
despite the subpar performance the associated press said for two magical hours the rock band u2 achieved what warriors politicians and diplomats could not they united bosnia
andrew mueller of the independent wrote for the first time since the start of the war in <year> people more accustomed to seeing each other through the sights of a rifle were converging on the capital to listen to music together
it was a reminder of prewar sarajevo home to some of old yugoslavia 's best rock bands
sacirbey stated that he was satisfied that the concert was held to promote a sense of normalcy peace and reconciliation in sarajevo and not to raise money
he also expressed thanks on behalf of president alija izetbegović who described the concert as a landmark event
mullen and the edge both agreed that playing the sarajevo concert had been the highlight of their careers mullen said t here 's no doubt that that is an experience i will never forget for the rest of my life
and if i had to spend <num> years in the band just to play that show
i think it would have been worthwhile
bono described it as one of the toughest and one of the sweetest nights of my life saying of the audience i think they wanted more than anything a return to normalcy
that 's what these people want it 's what they deserve
he also speculated that the loss of his voice had allowed room for sarajevo to take the gig away from us
they could see that things could go horribly wrong they 'd gone to a lot of trouble to come here and they were just going to make it happen
and they did
after the completion of the popmart tour he said it was amazing and confounding to discover that on our most pop of tours some of the best shows were in political hotspots like santiago sarajevo tel aviv
anywhere music meant more than entertainment
following the concert president izetbegović presented bono with an honorary bosnian passport in recognition of his humanitarian efforts during the war
nato troops remained in sarajevo until <year> while european union peace @-@ keeping troops remain in the city
following the sarajevo concert the edge 's solo performance of sunday bloody sunday was performed at the majority of shows for the remainder of the tour and a recording of the song from the sarajevo concert was released on the cd single for if god will send his angels on <num> december <year> the edge later stated the band had rediscovered the song in sarajevo after his solo performance
a short documentary about the concert missing sarajevo was included on the dvd release of u2 's <year> video compilation the best of <year> @-@ <year>
after u2 first performed miss sarajevo at the sarajevo concert it was not performed again until the second leg of the vertigo tour in <year>
u2 did not return to perform in any country in the former yugoslavia until august <year> when they performed two shows in zagreb during the u2 <num> ° tour
during the zagreb shows bono stated that his honorary bosnian passport was one of his most treasured possessions which prompted the country 's council of ministers to announce that his passport was to be revoked citing how country 's laws do not allow honorary citizenships to be conferred
the province of alberta was not created until september <year> more than two years after the slide
the community was still part of the northwest territories when the incident occurred at <num> <num> am on april <num> <year>
over <num> million tonnes <num> million tons of limestone rock slid down turtle mountain within <num> seconds obliterating the eastern edge of frank the canadian pacific railway line and the coal mine
it was one of the largest landslides in canadian history and remains the deadliest as between <num> and <num> of the town 's residents were killed most of whom remain buried in the rubble
multiple factors led to the slide turtle mountain 's formation left it in a constant state of instability
coal mining operations may have weakened the mountain 's internal structure as did a wet winter and cold snap on the night of the disaster
the railway was repaired within three weeks and the mine was quickly reopened
the section of town closest to the mountain was relocated in <year> amid fears that another slide was possible
the town 's population nearly doubled its pre @-@ slide population by <year> but dwindled after the mine closed permanently in <year>
the community is now part of the municipality of crowsnest pass in the province of alberta and has a population around <num>
the site of the disaster which remains nearly unchanged since the slide is now a popular tourist destination
it has been designated a provincial historic site of alberta and is home to an interpretive centre that receives over <num> @,@ <num> visitors annually
a location was chosen near the base of turtle mountain in the crowsnest pass where coal had been discovered one year earlier
it was named after henry frank who along with samuel gebo owned the canadian @-@ american coal and coke company which operated the mine that the town was created to support
the pair celebrated the founding of the town on september <num> <year> with a gala opening that featured speeches from territorial leaders sporting events a dinner and tours of the mine and planned layout for the community
the canadian pacific railway cpr ran special trains that brought over <num> @,@ <num> people from neighbouring communities to celebrate the event
by april <year> the permanent population had reached <num> and the town featured a two @-@ storey school and four hotels
turtle mountain stands immediately south of frank
it consists of an older limestone layer folded over on top of softer materials such as shale and sandstone
erosion had left the mountain with a steep overhang of its limestone layer
it has long been unstable the blackfoot and kutenai peoples called it the mountain that moves and refused to camp in its vicinity
in the weeks leading up to the disaster miners occasionally felt rumblings from within the mountain while the pressure created by the shifting rock sometimes caused the timbers supporting the mine shafts to crack and splinter
the engineer instinctively set the throttle to full speed ahead and sped his train to safety across the bridge over the crowsnest river
at <num> <num> am <num> million cubic metres <num> million tonnes of limestone rock broke off the peak of turtle mountain
the section that broke was <num> @,@ <num> metres <num> @,@ <num> ft wide <num> metres <num> @,@ <num> ft high and <num> metres <num> ft deep
witnesses to the disaster claimed it took about <num> seconds for the slide to reach up the opposing hills indicating the mass of rock traveled at a speed of about <num> kilometres per hour <num> mph
the sound was heard as far away as cochrane over <num> kilometres <num> mi north of frank
initial reports on the disaster indicated that frank had been nearly wiped out by the mountain 's collapse
it was thought the rockslide was triggered by an earthquake volcanic eruption or explosion within the mine
the majority of the town survived but the slide buried buildings on the eastern outskirts of frank
seven cottages were destroyed as were several businesses the cemetery a <num> @-@ kilometre <num>
<num> mi stretch of road and railroad tracks and all of the mine 's buildings
approximately <num> people lived in the path of destruction located between the cpr tracks and the river
the death toll is uncertain estimates range between <num> and <num>
it is the deadliest landslide in canadian history and was the largest until the hope slide in <year>
it is possible that the toll may have been higher since as many as <num> transients had been camped at the base of the mountain while looking for work
some residents believed that they had left frank shortly before the slide though there is no way to be certain
most of the victims remain entombed beneath the rocks only <num> bodies were recovered in the immediate aftermath
the skeletons of six additional victims were unearthed in <year> by crews building a new road through the slide
initial news reports stated that between <num> and <num> men were within the mountain and had been buried with no hope of survival
in reality there were <num> miners working the night shift at the time of the disaster
three had been outside the mine and were killed by the slide
the remaining <num> were underground
they discovered that the entrance was blocked and water from the river which had been dammed by the slide was coming in via a secondary tunnel
they unsuccessfully tried to dig their way through the blocked entrance before one miner suggested he knew of a seam of coal that reached the surface
working a narrow tunnel in pairs and threes they dug through the coal for hours as the air around them became increasingly toxic
only three men still had enough energy to continue digging when they broke through to the surface late in the afternoon
the opening was too dangerous to escape from due to falling rocks from above
encouraged by their success the miners cut a new shaft that broke through under an outcropping of rock that protected them from falling debris
thirteen hours after they were buried all <num> men emerged from the mountain
the miners found that the row of cottages that served as their homes had been devastated and some of their families killed seemingly at random
one found his family alive and safe in a makeshift hospital but another emerged to discover his wife and four children had died
fifteen @-@ year @-@ old lillian clark working a late shift that night in the town 's boarding house had been given permission to stay overnight for the first time
she was the only member of her family to survive
her father was working outside the mine when the slide hit while her mother and six siblings were buried in their home
all <num> men living at the cpr work camp were killed but <num> more who were scheduled to move into the camp the day before the slide had not arrived — the train that was supposed to take them there from morrissey british columbia failed to pick them up
the spokane flyer a passenger train heading west from lethbridge was saved by cpr brakeman sid choquette one of two men who rushed across the rock @-@ strewn ground to warn the train that the track had been buried under the slide
through falling rocks and a dust cloud that impaired his visibility choquette ran for <num> kilometres <num>
<num> mi to warn the oncoming locomotive of the danger
the cpr gave him a letter of commendation and a <num> cheque in recognition of his heroism
premier frederick haultain arrived at the disaster site on may <num> where he met with engineers who had investigated the top of turtle mountain
though new fissures had formed at the peak they felt there was limited further risk to the town the cpr 's chief engineer was convinced that frank was in imminent danger from another slide
siding with the latter haultain ordered the town evacuated and the geological survey of canada gsc sent two of its top geologists to investigate further
they reported that the slide had created two new peaks on the mountain and that the north peak overlooking the town was not in imminent danger of collapse
as a result the evacuation order was lifted on may <num> and frank 's citizens returned
the north @-@ west mounted police reinforced by officers who arrived from cranbrook macleod and calgary kept tight control of the town and ensured that no cases of looting occurred during the evacuation
clearing the canadian pacific railway line was of paramount importance
approximately <num> kilometres <num>
<num> mi of the main line had been buried under the slide along with part of an auxiliary line
the cpr had the line cleared and rebuilt within three weeks
intent on reopening the mine workers opened passageways to the old mine works by may <num>
to their amazement they discovered that charlie the horse one of three who worked in the mine had survived for over a month underground
the horse had subsisted by eating the bark off the timber supports and by drinking from pools of water
the horse died when his rescuers overfed him on oats and brandy
the town 's population not only recovered but grew the <year> census of the canadian prairies listed the population at <num> @,@ <num>
a new study commissioned by the dominion government determined that the cracks in the mountain continued to grow and that the risk of another slide remained
consequently parts of frank closest to the mountain were dismantled or relocated to safer areas
a study conducted by the gsc immediately following the slide concluded that the primary cause was the mountain 's unstable anticline formation a layer of limestone rested on top of softer materials that after years of erosion resulted in a top @-@ heavy steep cliff
cracks laced the eastern face of the mountain while underground fissures allowed water to flow into the mountain 's core
local indigenous peoples of the area the blackfoot and ktunaxa had oral traditions referring to the peak as the mountain that moves
miners noticed the mountain had become increasingly unstable in the months preceding the slide they felt small tremors and the superintendent reported a general squeeze in the mountain at depths between <num> @,@ <num> metres <num> @,@ <num> ft and <num> @,@ <num> metres <num> @,@ <num> ft
they found that coal broke from its seam it was said to have practically mined itself
an unusually warm winter with warm days and cold nights was also a factor
water in the mountain 's fissures froze and thawed repeatedly further weakening the mountain 's supports
heavy snowfall in the region in march was followed by a warm april causing the mountain snows to melt into the fissures
gsc geologists concluded that the weather conditions that night likely triggered the slide
the crew of the freight train that arrived at frank shortly before the disaster said it was the coldest night of the winter with overnight temperatures falling below − <num> ° c <num> ° f
geologists speculated that the cold snap and rapid freezing resulted in expansion of the fissures causing the limestone to break off and tumble down the mountain
though the gsc concluded that mining activities contributed to the slide the facility 's owners disagreed
their engineers claimed that the mine bore no responsibility
later studies suggested that the mountain had been at a point of equilibrium even a small deformation such as that caused by the mine 's existence would have helped trigger a slide
the mine was quickly re @-@ opened even though rock continued to tumble down the mountain
coal production at frank peaked in <year> but the mine was permanently closed in <year> after it became unprofitable
the slide created two new peaks on the mountain the south peak stands <num> @,@ <num> metres <num> @,@ <num> ft high and the north peak <num> @,@ <num> metres <num> @,@ <num> ft
geologists believe that another slide is inevitable though not imminent
the south peak is considered the most likely to fall it would likely create a slide about one @-@ sixth the size of the <year> slide
the mountain continuously monitored for changes in stability has been studied on numerous occasions
the alberta geological survey operates a state @-@ of @-@ the @-@ art monitoring system used by researchers around the world
over <num> monitoring stations have been placed on the face of the mountain to provide an early warning system for area residents in case of another slide
geologists have debated about what caused the slide debris to travel the distance it did
the air cushion theory an early hypothesis postulated that a layer of air was trapped between the mass of rock and the mountain which caused the rock to move a greater distance than would otherwise be expected
acoustic fluidization is another theory which suggests that large masses of material create seismic energy that reduces friction and causes the debris to flow down the mountain as though it is a fluid
geologists created the term debris avalanche to describe the frank slide
the entire town of frank was claimed to have been buried though much of the town itself was unscathed
the belief that a branch of the union bank of canada had been buried with as much as <num> @,@ <num> persisted for many years
the bank — untouched by the slide — remained in the same location until it was demolished in <year> after which the buried treasure legend arose
crews building a new road through the pass in <year> operated under police guard as it was believed they could unearth the supposedly buried bank
several people telling amazing stories to those who would listen passed themselves off as the sole survivor in the years following the slide
the most common such tale is that of an infant girl said to have been the only survivor of the slide
her real name unknown the girl was called frankie slide
several stories were told of her miraculous escape she was found in a bale of hay lying on rocks under the collapsed roof of her house or in the arms of her dead mother
the legend was based primarily on the story of marion leitch who was thrown from her home into a pile of hay when the slide enveloped her home
her sisters also survived they were found unharmed under a collapsed ceiling joist
her parents and four brothers died
influencing the story was the survival of two @-@ year @-@ old gladys ennis who was found outside her home in the mud
the last survivor of the slide she died in <year>
in total <num> people in the path of the slide survived in addition to the <num> miners who escaped from the tunnels under turtle mountain
a ballad by ed mccurdy featuring the story of frankie slide was popular in parts of canada in the <num>
the slide has formed the basis of other songs including how the mountain came down by stompin tom connors and more recently frank ab by the rural alberta advantage
the frank slide has been the subject of several books both historical and fictional
it has remained a popular tourist destination in part due to its proximity to the crowsnest highway
the province built a roadside turnout in <year> to accommodate the traffic
town boosters unsuccessfully sought to have the site designated as a national historic site in <year>
it was later designated a provincial historic site of alberta
the provincial government designated the slide area a restricted development zone in <year> which prevents alteration of the site
in <year> a memorial plaque was erected
the frank slide interpretive centre within sight of the mountain was opened in <year>
a museum and tourist stop document the frank slide and the region 's coal mining history
the site receives over <num> @,@ <num> tourist visits annually
though frank recovered from the slide and achieved a peak population of <num> @,@ <num> shortly thereafter the closure of the mine resulted in a longstanding decline in population
frank ceased to be an independent community in <year> when it was amalgamated into the municipality of crowsnest pass along with the neighbouring communities of blairmore coleman hillcrest and bellevue
frank is now home to about <num> residents
ᵻnz are large biomolecules or macromolecules consisting of one or more long chains of amino acid residues
proteins perform a vast array of functions within organisms including catalysing metabolic reactions dna replication responding to stimuli and transporting molecules from one location to another
proteins differ from one another primarily in their sequence of amino acids which is dictated by the nucleotide sequence of their genes and which usually results in protein folding into a specific three @-@ dimensional structure that determines its activity
a linear chain of amino acid residues is called a polypeptide
a protein contains at least one long polypeptide
short polypeptides containing less than <num> @-@ <num> residues are rarely considered to be proteins and are commonly called peptides or sometimes oligopeptides
the individual amino acid residues are bonded together by peptide bonds and adjacent amino acid residues
the sequence of amino acid residues in a protein is defined by the sequence of a gene which is encoded in the genetic code
in general the genetic code specifies <num> standard amino acids however in certain organisms the genetic code can include selenocysteine and — in certain archaea — pyrrolysine
shortly after or even during synthesis the residues in a protein are often chemically modified by post @-@ translational modification which alters the physical and chemical properties folding stability activity and ultimately the function of the proteins
sometimes proteins have non @-@ peptide groups attached which can be called prosthetic groups or cofactors
proteins can also work together to achieve a particular function and they often associate to form stable protein complexes
once formed proteins only exist for a certain period of time and are then degraded and recycled by the cell 's machinery through the process of protein turnover
a protein 's lifespan is measured in terms of its half @-@ life and covers a wide range
they can exist for minutes or years with an average lifespan of <num> – <num> days in mammalian cells
abnormal and or misfolded proteins are degraded more rapidly either due to being targeted for destruction or due to being unstable
like other biological macromolecules such as polysaccharides and nucleic acids proteins are essential parts of organisms and participate in virtually every process within cells
many proteins are enzymes that catalyse biochemical reactions and are vital to metabolism
proteins also have structural or mechanical functions such as actin and myosin in muscle and the proteins in the cytoskeleton which form a system of scaffolding that maintains cell shape
other proteins are important in cell signaling immune responses cell adhesion and the cell cycle
in animals proteins are needed in the diet to provide the essential amino acids that cannot be synthesized
digestion breaks the proteins down for use in the metabolism
proteins may be purified from other cellular components using a variety of techniques such as ultracentrifugation precipitation electrophoresis and chromatography the advent of genetic engineering has made possible a number of methods to facilitate purification
methods commonly used to study protein structure and function include immunohistochemistry site @-@ directed mutagenesis x @-@ ray crystallography nuclear magnetic resonance and mass spectrometry
all proteinogenic amino acids possess common structural features including an α @-@ carbon to which an amino group a carboxyl group and a variable side chain are bonded
only proline differs from this basic structure as it contains an unusual ring to the n @-@ end amine group which forces the co – nh amide moiety into a fixed conformation
the side chains of the standard amino acids detailed in the list of standard amino acids have a great variety of chemical structures and properties it is the combined effect of all of the amino acid side chains in a protein that ultimately determines its three @-@ dimensional structure and its chemical reactivity
the amino acids in a polypeptide chain are linked by peptide bonds
once linked in the protein chain an individual amino acid is called a residue and the linked series of carbon nitrogen and oxygen atoms are known as the main chain or protein backbone
the peptide bond has two resonance forms that contribute some double @-@ bond character and inhibit rotation around its axis so that the alpha carbons are roughly coplanar
the other two dihedral angles in the peptide bond determine the local shape assumed by the protein backbone
the end of the protein with a free carboxyl group is known as the c @-@ terminus or carboxy terminus whereas the end with a free amino group is known as the n @-@ terminus or amino terminus
the words protein polypeptide and peptide are a little ambiguous and can overlap in meaning
protein is generally used to refer to the complete biological molecule in a stable conformation whereas peptide is generally reserved for a short amino acid oligomers often lacking a stable three @-@ dimensional structure
however the boundary between the two is not well defined and usually lies near <num> – <num> residues
polypeptide can refer to any single linear chain of amino acids usually regardless of length but often implies an absence of a defined conformation
g
e
coli and staphylococcus aureus
smaller bacteria such as mycoplasma or spirochetes contain fewer molecules namely on the order of <num> @,@ <num> to <num> million
by contrast eukaryotic cells are larger and thus contain much more protein
for instance yeast cells were estimated to contain about <num> million proteins and human cells on the order of <num> to <num> billion
note that bacterial genomes encode about <num> times fewer proteins than humans e
g
small bacteria <num> @,@ <num> e
coli <num> @,@ <num> yeast <num> @,@ <num> human <num> @,@ <num>
importantly the concentration of individual proteins ranges from a few molecules per cell to hundreds of thousands
in fact about a third of all proteins is not produced in most cells or only induced under certain circumstances
for instance of the <num> @,@ <num> or so proteins encoded by the human genome only <num> @,@ <num> are detected in lymphoblastoid cells
each protein has its own unique amino acid sequence that is specified by the nucleotide sequence of the gene encoding this protein
the genetic code is a set of three @-@ nucleotide sets called codons and each three @-@ nucleotide combination designates an amino acid for example aug adenine @-@ uracil @-@ guanine is the code for methionine
because dna contains four nucleotides the total number of possible codons is <num> hence there is some redundancy in the genetic code with some amino acids specified by more than one codon
genes encoded in dna are first transcribed into pre @-@ messenger rna mrna by proteins such as rna polymerase
most organisms then process the pre @-@ mrna also known as a primary transcript using various forms of post @-@ transcriptional modification to form the mature mrna which is then used as a template for protein synthesis by the ribosome
in prokaryotes the mrna may either be used as soon as it is produced or be bound by a ribosome after having moved away from the nucleoid
in contrast eukaryotes make mrna in the cell nucleus and then translocate it across the nuclear membrane into the cytoplasm where protein synthesis then takes place
the rate of protein synthesis is higher in prokaryotes than eukaryotes and can reach up to <num> amino acids per second
the process of synthesizing a protein from an mrna template is known as translation
the mrna is loaded onto the ribosome and is read three nucleotides at a time by matching each codon to its base pairing anticodon located on a transfer rna molecule which carries the amino acid corresponding to the codon it recognizes
the enzyme aminoacyl trna synthetase charges the trna molecules with the correct amino acids
the growing polypeptide is often termed the nascent chain
proteins are always biosynthesized from n @-@ terminus to c @-@ terminus
the size of a synthesized protein can be measured by the number of amino acids it contains and by its total molecular mass which is normally reported in units of daltons synonymous with atomic mass units or the derivative unit kilodalton kda
yeast proteins are on average <num> amino acids long and <num> kda in mass
the largest known proteins are the titins a component of the muscle sarcomere with a molecular mass of almost <num> @,@ <num> kda and a total length of almost <num> @,@ <num> amino acids
chemical synthesis allows for the introduction of non @-@ natural amino acids into polypeptide chains such as attachment of fluorescent probes to amino acid side chains
these methods are useful in laboratory biochemistry and cell biology though generally not for commercial applications
chemical synthesis is inefficient for polypeptides longer than about <num> amino acids and the synthesized proteins may not readily assume their native tertiary structure
most chemical synthesis methods proceed from c @-@ terminus to n @-@ terminus opposite the biological reaction
the shape into which a protein naturally folds is known as its native conformation
although many proteins can fold unassisted simply through the chemical properties of their amino acids others require the aid of molecular chaperones to fold into their native states
biochemists often refer to four distinct aspects of a protein 's structure primary structure the amino acid sequence
a protein is a polyamide
secondary structure regularly repeating local structures stabilized by hydrogen bonds
the most common examples are the α @-@ helix β @-@ sheet and turns
because secondary structures are local many regions of different secondary structure can be present in the same protein molecule
tertiary structure the overall shape of a single protein molecule the spatial relationship of the secondary structures to one another
tertiary structure is generally stabilized by nonlocal interactions most commonly the formation of a hydrophobic core but also through salt bridges hydrogen bonds disulfide bonds and even posttranslational modifications
the term tertiary structure is often used as synonymous with the term fold
the tertiary structure is what controls the basic function of the protein
quaternary structure the structure formed by several protein molecules polypeptide chains usually called protein subunits in this context which function as a single protein complex
proteins are not entirely rigid molecules
in addition to these levels of structure proteins may shift between several related structures while they perform their functions
in the context of these functional rearrangements these tertiary or quaternary structures are usually referred to as conformations and transitions between them are called conformational changes
such changes are often induced by the binding of a substrate molecule to an enzyme 's active site or the physical region of the protein that participates in chemical catalysis
in solution proteins also undergo variation in structure through thermal vibration and the collision with other molecules
proteins can be informally divided into three main classes which correlate with typical tertiary structures globular proteins fibrous proteins and membrane proteins
almost all globular proteins are soluble and many are enzymes
fibrous proteins are often structural such as collagen the major component of connective tissue or keratin the protein component of hair and nails
membrane proteins often serve as receptors or provide channels for polar or charged molecules to pass through the cell membrane
a special case of intramolecular hydrogen bonds within proteins poorly shielded from water attack and hence promoting their own dehydration are called dehydrons
common experimental methods of structure determination include x @-@ ray crystallography and nmr spectroscopy both of which can produce information at atomic resolution
however nmr experiments are able to provide information from which a subset of distances between pairs of atoms can be estimated and the final possible conformations for a protein are determined by solving a distance geometry problem
dual polarisation interferometry is a quantitative analytical method for measuring the overall protein conformation and conformational changes due to interactions or other stimulus
circular dichroism is another laboratory technique for determining internal β @-@ sheet α @-@ helical composition of proteins
cryoelectron microscopy is used to produce lower @-@ resolution structural information about very large protein complexes including assembled viruses a variant known as electron crystallography can also produce high @-@ resolution information in some cases especially for two @-@ dimensional crystals of membrane proteins
solved structures are usually deposited in the protein data bank pdb a freely available resource from which structural data about thousands of proteins can be obtained in the form of cartesian coordinates for each atom in the protein
many more gene sequences are known than protein structures
further the set of solved structures is biased toward proteins that can be easily subjected to the conditions required in x @-@ ray crystallography one of the major structure determination methods
in particular globular proteins are comparatively easy to crystallize in preparation for x @-@ ray crystallography
membrane proteins by contrast are difficult to crystallize and are underrepresented in the pdb
structural genomics initiatives have attempted to remedy these deficiencies by systematically solving representative structures of major fold classes
protein structure prediction methods attempt to provide a means of generating a plausible structure for proteins whose structures have not been experimentally determined
with the exception of certain types of rna most other biological molecules are relatively inert elements upon which proteins act
proteins make up half the dry weight of an escherichia coli cell whereas other macromolecules such as dna and rna make up only <num> and <num> respectively
the set of proteins expressed in a particular cell or cell type is known as its proteome
the chief characteristic of proteins that also allows their diverse set of functions is their ability to bind other molecules specifically and tightly
the region of the protein responsible for binding another molecule is known as the binding site and is often a depression or pocket on the molecular surface
this binding ability is mediated by the tertiary structure of the protein which defines the binding site pocket and by the chemical properties of the surrounding amino acids side chains
protein binding can be extraordinarily tight and specific for example the ribonuclease inhibitor protein binds to human angiogenin with a sub @-@ femtomolar dissociation constant <num> − <num> m but does not bind at all to its amphibian homolog onconase <num> m
extremely minor chemical changes such as the addition of a single methyl group to a binding partner can sometimes suffice to nearly eliminate binding for example the aminoacyl trna synthetase specific to the amino acid valine discriminates against the very similar side chain of the amino acid isoleucine
proteins can bind to other proteins as well as to small @-@ molecule substrates
when proteins bind specifically to other copies of the same molecule they can oligomerize to form fibrils this process occurs often in structural proteins that consist of globular monomers that self @-@ associate to form rigid fibers
protein – protein interactions also regulate enzymatic activity control progression through the cell cycle and allow the assembly of large protein complexes that carry out many closely related reactions with a common biological function
proteins can also bind to or even be integrated into cell membranes
the ability of binding partners to induce conformational changes in proteins allows the construction of enormously complex signaling networks
importantly as interactions between proteins are reversible and depend heavily on the availability of different groups of partner proteins to form aggregates that are capable to carry out discrete sets of function study of the interactions between specific proteins is a key to understand important aspects of cellular function and ultimately the properties that distinguish particular cell types
enzymes are usually highly specific and accelerate only one or a few chemical reactions
enzymes carry out most of the reactions involved in metabolism as well as manipulating dna in processes such as dna replication dna repair and transcription
some enzymes act on other proteins to add or remove chemical groups in a process known as posttranslational modification
about <num> @,@ <num> reactions are known to be catalysed by enzymes
the rate acceleration conferred by enzymatic catalysis is often enormous — as much as <num> @-@ fold increase in rate over the uncatalysed reaction in the case of orotate decarboxylase <num> million years without the enzyme <num> milliseconds with the enzyme
the molecules bound and acted upon by enzymes are called substrates
although enzymes can consist of hundreds of amino acids it is usually only a small fraction of the residues that come in contact with the substrate and an even smaller fraction — three to four residues on average — that are directly involved in catalysis
the region of the enzyme that binds the substrate and contains the catalytic residues is known as the active site
dirigent proteins are members of a class of proteins that dictate the stereochemistry of a compound synthesized by other enzymes
some proteins such as insulin are extracellular proteins that transmit a signal from the cell in which they were synthesized to other cells in distant tissues
others are membrane proteins that act as receptors whose main function is to bind a signaling molecule and induce a biochemical response in the cell
many receptors have a binding site exposed on the cell surface and an effector domain within the cell which may have enzymatic activity or may undergo a conformational change detected by other proteins within the cell
antibodies are protein components of an adaptive immune system whose main function is to bind antigens or foreign substances in the body and target them for destruction
antibodies can be secreted into the extracellular environment or anchored in the membranes of specialized b cells known as plasma cells
whereas enzymes are limited in their binding affinity for their substrates by the necessity of conducting their reaction antibodies have no such constraints
an antibody 's binding affinity to its target is extraordinarily high
many ligand transport proteins bind particular small biomolecules and transport them to other locations in the body of a multicellular organism
these proteins must have a high binding affinity when their ligand is present in high concentrations but must also release the ligand when it is present at low concentrations in the target tissues
the canonical example of a ligand @-@ binding protein is haemoglobin which transports oxygen from the lungs to other organs and tissues in all vertebrates and has close homologs in every biological kingdom
lectins are sugar @-@ binding proteins which are highly specific for their sugar moieties
lectins typically play a role in biological recognition phenomena involving cells and proteins
receptors and hormones are highly specific binding proteins
transmembrane proteins can also serve as ligand transport proteins that alter the permeability of the cell membrane to small molecules and ions
the membrane alone has a hydrophobic core through which polar or charged molecules cannot diffuse
membrane proteins contain internal channels that allow such molecules to enter and exit the cell
many ion channel proteins are specialized to select for only a particular ion for example potassium and sodium channels often discriminate for only one of the two ions
most structural proteins are fibrous proteins for example collagen and elastin are critical components of connective tissue such as cartilage and keratin is found in hard or filamentous structures such as hair nails feathers hooves and some animal shells
some globular proteins can also play structural functions for example actin and tubulin are globular and soluble as monomers but polymerize to form long stiff fibers that make up the cytoskeleton which allows the cell to maintain its shape and size
other proteins that serve structural functions are motor proteins such as myosin kinesin and dynein which are capable of generating mechanical forces
these proteins are crucial for cellular motility of single celled organisms and the sperm of many multicellular organisms which reproduce sexually
they also generate the forces exerted by contracting muscles and play essential roles in intracellular transport
in vitro studies of purified proteins in controlled environments are useful for learning how a protein carries out its function for example enzyme kinetics studies explore the chemical mechanism of an enzyme 's catalytic activity and its relative affinity for various possible substrate molecules
by contrast in vivo experiments can provide information about the physiological role of a protein in the context of a cell or even a whole organism
in silico studies use computational methods to study proteins
this process usually begins with cell lysis in which a cell 's membrane is disrupted and its internal contents released into a solution known as a crude lysate
the resulting mixture can be purified using ultracentrifugation which fractionates the various cellular components into fractions containing soluble proteins membrane lipids and proteins cellular organelles and nucleic acids
precipitation by a method known as salting out can concentrate the proteins from this lysate
various types of chromatography are then used to isolate the protein or proteins of interest based on properties such as molecular weight net charge and binding affinity
the level of purification can be monitored using various types of gel electrophoresis if the desired protein 's molecular weight and isoelectric point are known by spectroscopy if the protein has distinguishable spectroscopic features or by enzyme assays if the protein has enzymatic activity
additionally proteins can be isolated according their charge using electrofocusing
for natural proteins a series of purification steps may be necessary to obtain protein sufficiently pure for laboratory applications
to simplify this process genetic engineering is often used to add chemical features to proteins that make them easier to purify without affecting their structure or activity
here a tag consisting of a specific amino acid sequence often a series of histidine residues a his @-@ tag is attached to one terminus of the protein
as a result when the lysate is passed over a chromatography column containing nickel the histidine residues ligate the nickel and attach to the column while the untagged components of the lysate pass unimpeded
a number of different tags have been developed to help researchers purify specific proteins from complex mixtures
although many intracellular proteins are synthesized in the cytoplasm and membrane @-@ bound or secreted proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum the specifics of how proteins are targeted to specific organelles or cellular structures is often unclear
a useful technique for assessing cellular localization uses genetic engineering to express in a cell a fusion protein or chimera consisting of the natural protein of interest linked to a reporter such as green fluorescent protein gfp
the fused protein 's position within the cell can be cleanly and efficiently visualized using microscopy as shown in the figure opposite
other methods for elucidating the cellular location of proteins requires the use of known compartmental markers for regions such as the er the golgi lysosomes or vacuoles mitochondria chloroplasts plasma membrane etc
with the use of fluorescently tagged versions of these markers or of antibodies to known markers it becomes much simpler to identify the localization of a protein of interest
for example indirect immunofluorescence will allow for fluorescence colocalization and demonstration of location
fluorescent dyes are used to label cellular compartments for a similar purpose
other possibilities exist as well
for example immunohistochemistry usually utilizes an antibody to one or more proteins of interest that are conjugated to enzymes yielding either luminescent or chromogenic signals that can be compared between samples allowing for localization information
another applicable technique is cofractionation in sucrose or other material gradients using isopycnic centrifugation
while this technique does not prove colocalization of a compartment of known density and the protein of interest it does increase the likelihood and is more amenable to large @-@ scale studies
finally the gold @-@ standard method of cellular localization is immunoelectron microscopy
this technique also uses an antibody to the protein of interest along with classical electron microscopy techniques
the sample is prepared for normal electron microscopic examination and then treated with an antibody to the protein of interest that is conjugated to an extremely electro @-@ dense material usually gold
this allows for the localization of both ultrastructural details as well as the protein of interest
through another genetic engineering application known as site @-@ directed mutagenesis researchers can alter the protein sequence and hence its structure cellular localization and susceptibility to regulation
this technique even allows the incorporation of unnatural amino acids into proteins using modified trnas and may allow the rational design of new proteins with novel properties
key experimental techniques in proteomics include 2d electrophoresis which allows the separation of a large number of proteins mass spectrometry which allows rapid high @-@ throughput identification of proteins and sequencing of peptides most often after in @-@ gel digestion protein microarrays which allow the detection of the relative levels of a large number of proteins present in a cell and two @-@ hybrid screening which allows the systematic exploration of protein – protein interactions
the total complement of biologically possible such interactions is known as the interactome
a systematic attempt to determine the structures of proteins representing every possible fold is known as structural genomics
the development of such tools has been driven by the large amount of genomic and proteomic data available for a variety of organisms including the human genome
it is simply impossible to study all proteins experimentally hence only a few are subjected to laboratory experiments while computational tools are used to extrapolate to similar proteins
such homologous proteins can be efficiently identified in distantly related organisms by sequence alignment
genome and gene sequences can be searched by a variety of tools for certain properties
sequence profiling tools can find restriction enzyme sites open reading frames in nucleotide sequences and predict secondary structures
phylogenetic trees can be constructed and evolutionary hypotheses developed using special software like clustalw regarding the ancestry of modern organisms and the genes they express
the field of bioinformatics is now indispensable for the analysis of genes and proteins
the most successful type of structure prediction known as homology modeling relies on the existence of a template structure with sequence similarity to the protein being modeled structural genomics goal is to provide sufficient representation in solved structures to model most of those that remain
although producing accurate models remains a challenge when only distantly related template structures are available it has been suggested that sequence alignment is the bottleneck in this process as quite accurate models can be produced if a perfect sequence alignment is known
many structure prediction methods have served to inform the emerging field of protein engineering in which novel protein folds have already been designed
a more complex computational problem is the prediction of intermolecular interactions such as in molecular docking and protein – protein interaction prediction
the processes of protein folding and binding can be simulated using such technique as molecular mechanics in particular molecular dynamics and monte carlo which increasingly take advantage of parallel and distributed computing folding home project molecular modeling on gpu
the folding of small α @-@ helical protein domains such as the villin headpiece and the hiv accessory protein have been successfully simulated in silico and hybrid methods that combine standard molecular dynamics with quantum mechanics calculations have allowed exploration of the electronic states of rhodopsins
predicting and analysing protein disorder is therefore an important part of protein structure characterisation
the amino acids that an organism cannot synthesize on its own are referred to as essential amino acids
key enzymes that synthesize certain amino acids are not present in animals — such as aspartokinase which catalyses the first step in the synthesis of lysine methionine and threonine from aspartate
if amino acids are present in the environment microorganisms can conserve energy by taking up the amino acids from their surroundings and downregulating their biosynthetic pathways
in animals amino acids are obtained through the consumption of foods containing protein
ingested proteins are then broken down into amino acids through digestion which typically involves denaturation of the protein through exposure to acid and hydrolysis by enzymes called proteases
some ingested amino acids are used for protein biosynthesis while others are converted to glucose through gluconeogenesis or fed into the citric acid cycle
this use of protein as a fuel is particularly important under starvation conditions as it allows the body 's own proteins to be used to support life particularly those found in muscle
amino acids are also an important dietary source of nitrogen
noted examples at the time included albumin from egg whites blood serum albumin fibrin and wheat gluten
proteins were first described by the dutch chemist gerardus johannes mulder and named by the swedish chemist jöns jacob berzelius in <year>
mulder carried out elemental analysis of common proteins and found that nearly all proteins had the same empirical formula c400h620n100o120p1s1
he came to the erroneous conclusion that they might be composed of a single type of very large molecule
the term protein to describe these molecules was proposed by mulder 's associate berzelius protein is derived from the greek word πρώτειος proteios meaning primary in the lead or standing in front -in
mulder went on to identify the products of protein degradation such as the amino acid leucine for which he found a nearly correct molecular weight of <num> da
early nutritional scientists such as the german carl von voit believed that protein was the most important nutrient for maintaining the structure of the body because it was generally believed that flesh makes flesh
karl heinrich ritthausen extended known protein forms with the identification of glutamic acid
at the connecticut agricultural experiment station a detailed review of the vegetable proteins was compiled by thomas burr osborne
working with lafayette mendel and applying liebig 's law of the minimum in feeding laboratory rats the nutritionally essential amino acids were established
the work was continued and communicated by william cumming rose
the understanding of proteins as polypeptides came through the work of franz hofmeister and hermann emil fischer
the central role of proteins as enzymes in living organisms was not fully appreciated until <year> when james b
sumner showed that the enzyme urease was in fact a protein
the difficulty in purifying proteins in large quantities made them very difficult for early protein biochemists to study
hence early studies focused on proteins that could be purified in large quantities e
g
those of blood egg white various toxins and digestive metabolic enzymes obtained from slaughterhouses
in the <num> the armour hot dog co
purified <num> kg of pure bovine pancreatic ribonuclease a and made it freely available to scientists this gesture helped ribonuclease a become a major target for biochemical study for the following decades
linus pauling is credited with the successful prediction of regular protein secondary structures based on hydrogen bonding an idea first put forth by william astbury in <year>
later work by walter kauzmann on denaturation based partly on previous studies by kaj linderstrøm @-@ lang contributed an understanding of protein folding and structure mediated by hydrophobic interactions
the first protein to be sequenced was insulin by frederick sanger in <year>
sanger correctly determined the amino acid sequence of insulin thus conclusively demonstrating that proteins consisted of linear polymers of amino acids rather than branched chains colloids or cyclols
he won the nobel prize for this achievement in <year>
the first protein structures to be solved were hemoglobin and myoglobin by max perutz and sir john cowdery kendrew respectively in <year>
as of <year> the protein data bank has over <num> @,@ <num> atomic @-@ resolution structures of proteins

lisa wrote the lyrics for some of her songs in her landspace and launcher albums as well as the lyrics for the singles bright flight l
miranic shirushi and rally go round rally go round was co @-@ written with songwriter shin furuya
lisa 's musical style is described by dennis amith of j -ent as a young woman with style beautiful vocals and the ability to take on various musical styles may it be happy upbeat rock music or even something more darker
she has used the phrase kyō mo ii hi da 今日もいい日だっ another great day as a theme throughout her career the phrase is also the name of her personal blog
in an interview with hmv japan she mentioned that before her major debut she tended to sing pop songs and because of this she felt uneasy when making oath sign which had a heavy and dark style although she was able to receive several favorable responses to the single which allowed her to make her next single crossing field with confidence
as for crossing field she says that feels that the song grows every time she sings it in the same way that love is nurtured through dates or love letters
in best day best way she mentioned that the song 's theme is what you did yesterday will lead to what happens today and that the lyrics are delivered as if they are her own words

in an interview with oricon lisa explained her experiences with träumerei where she stated that because day break illusion is an original anime she wanted the song to be presented in the color of her own work but even in the world of anime her music would continue to have an atmosphere of rock as opposed to the pop style she used in best day best way
she mentioned that she sang that song in a way that she felt the conflicts that were present in the story and with the strength that was part of the show 's theme
with regards to the song 's music video she wanted to have a video which would express in color emotions such as the use of red to represent confrontations black to represent the feeling of being lost and green for frightening things
in making the single bright flight l
miranic she mentions in an interview with hmv japan that the concept of the single is that it can be divided into two parts pink and black
pink is the color of bright flight a song which is in a pop style and was written in a cute image in mind while black is the color of l
miranic which is in a dark rock style and has the theme of a bad woman
lisa mentioned that the name l
miranic was chosen because the song is linked to criminals and that since miranic is a name in some countries adding her name to miranic to make lisa @-@ miranic would mean that the criminal in the song is her
dennis amith of j -ent reviewed lisa 's album landspace where he describes the song crossing field as a song about wanting to forget the weakness and securities of one past and being with someone you love who gives you the strength to become even stronger
meanwhile he describes the song best day best way as a fun and happy track about believing in yourself and overcoming anything bad that have happened in the past and moving forward
finally he describes träumerei as another inspirational song about one losing the rhythm in their heart and is now on the road of loneliness but still the person wants to pierce the sky with their own light shatter the darkness and have a fresh new start in life
he concludes the review by saying that the album is full of upbeat and inspirational songs and showcases lisa 's talents as a vocalist and in contrast to many anison artists who are known for their cute and sweet vocals lisa is able to take on many musical styles

founded in <year> they have played at their current home ground villa park since <year>
aston villa were the originators and founding members of the football league in <year>
they were also founding members of the premier league in <year>
in june <year> the club was sold by american businessman randy lerner to recon group owned by chinese businessman dr tony jiantong xia
aston villa are one of the oldest and most successful football clubs in the history of english football
villa won the <year> – <num> european cup and are thus one of five english clubs to win what is now the uefa champions league
they have the fifth highest total of major honours won by an english club having won the first division championship seven times the fa cup seven times the football league cup five times and the european cup and uefa super cup double in <year>
they have a fierce local rivalry with birmingham city
the second city derby between aston villa and birmingham city has been played since <year>
the club 's traditional kit colours are claret shirts with sky blue sleeves white shorts and sky blue socks
their traditional badge is of a rampant lion which was introduced by the club 's scottish chairman william mcgregor in honour of the royal standard of scotland
the four founders of aston villa were jack hughes frederick matthews walter price and william scattergood
aston villa 's first match was against the local aston brook st mary 's rugby team
as a condition of the match the villa side had to agree to play the first half under rugby rules and the second half under football rules
after moving to the wellington road ground in <year> villa soon established themselves as one of the best teams in the midlands winning their first honour the birmingham senior cup in <year> under the captaincy of scotsman george ramsay
the club won their first fa cup in <year> with captain archie hunter becoming one of the game 's first household names
aston villa were one of the dozen teams that competed in the inaugural football league in <year> with one of the club 's directors william mcgregor being the league 's founder
aston villa emerged as the most successful english club of the victorian era winning no fewer than five league titles and three fa cups by the end of queen victoria 's reign
in <year> the year villa won the double they moved into their present home the aston lower grounds
supporters coined the name villa park no official declaration listed the ground as villa park
aston villa won their sixth fa cup in <year> soon after though the club began a slow decline that led to villa at the time one of the most famous and successful clubs in world football being relegated in <year> for the first time to the second division
this was largely the result of a dismal defensive record they conceded <num> goals in <num> games <num> of them coming from arsenal 's ted drake in an infamous <num> – <num> defeat at villa park
like all english clubs villa lost seven seasons to the second world war and that conflict brought several careers to a premature end
the team was rebuilt under the guidance of former player alex massie for the remainder of the <num>
aston villa 's first trophy for <num> years came in the <year> – <num> season when another former villa player eric houghton led the club to a then record seventh fa cup final win defeating the busby babes of manchester united in the final
the team struggled in the league though and were relegated two seasons later due in large part to complacency
however under the stewardship of manager joe mercer villa returned to the top @-@ flight in <year> as second division champions
the following season aston villa became the first team to win the football league cup
mercer 's forced retirement from the club in <year> signalled a period of deep turmoil
the most successful club in england was struggling to keep pace with changes in the modern game with villa being relegated for the third time under manager dick taylor in <year>
the following season the fans called for the board to resign as villa finished <num> in the second division
with mounting debts and villa lying at the bottom of division two the board sacked tommy cummings the manager brought in to replace taylor and within weeks the entire board resigned under overwhelming pressure from fans
after much speculation control of the club was bought by london financier pat matthews who also brought in doug ellis as chairman
however new ownership could not prevent villa being relegated to the third division for the first time at the end of the <year> – <num> season
however villa gradually began to recover under the management of former club captain vic crowe
in the <year> – <num> season they returned to the second division as champions with a record <num> points
in <year> ron saunders was appointed manager
his brand of no @-@ nonsense man @-@ management proved effective with the club winning the league cup the following season and at the end of season <year> – <num> he had taken them back into the first division and into europe
villa were back among the elite as saunders continued to mould a winning team
this culminated in a seventh top @-@ flight league title in <year> – <num>
to the surprise of commentators and fans saunders quit halfway through the <year> – <num> season after falling out with the chairman with villa in the quarter final of the european cup
he was replaced by his softly @-@ spoken assistant manager tony barton who guided the club to a <num> – <num> victory over bayern munich in the european cup final in rotterdam courtesy of a peter withe goal
the following season villa were crowned european super cup winners beating barcelona in the final
this marked a pinnacle though and villa 's fortunes declined sharply for most of the <num> culminating in relegation in <year>
this was followed by promotion the following year under graham taylor and a runners @-@ up position in the first division in the <year> – <num> season
villa were one of the founding members of the premier league in <year> and finished runners @-@ up to manchester united in the inaugural season
for the rest of the nineties however villa went through three different managers and their league positions were inconsistent although they did win two league cups and regularly achieved uefa cup qualification
villa reached the fa cup final in <year> but lost <num> – <num> to chelsea in the last game to be played at the old wembley stadium
again villa 's league position continued to fluctuate under several different managers and things came to a head in the summer of <year> when david o 'leary left in acrimony
after <num> years as chairman and single biggest shareholder approximately <num> doug ellis finally decided to sell his stake in aston villa due to ill @-@ health
after much speculation it was announced the club was to be bought by american businessman randy lerner owner of nfl franchise the cleveland browns
the arrival of a new owner in lerner and of manager martin o 'neill marked the start of a new period of optimism at villa park and sweeping changes occurred throughout the club including a new badge a new kit sponsor and team changes in the summer of <year>
the first cup final of the lerner era came in <year> when villa were beaten <num> – <num> in the league cup final
villa made a second trip to wembley in that season losing <num> – <num> to chelsea in the fa cup semifinal
just five days before the opening day of the <year> – <num> season o 'neill resigned as manager with immediate effect
the club appointed gérard houllier as a replacement in september <year> but he stepped down on <num> june <year> due to ill @-@ health
houllier was replaced by birmingham city manager alex mcleish despite numerous protests from fans against his appointment this was the first time that a manager had moved directly from birmingham to villa
mcleish 's contract was terminated at the end of the <year> – <num> season after villa finished in <num> place only just above the relegation zone
on <num> july <year> aston villa confirmed the appointment of former norwich city manager paul lambert as the replacement for mcleish
on <num> february <year> the club announced a financial loss of £ <num>
<num> million
lerner put the club up for sale on <num> may <year> with an estimated value of £ <num> million
with lerner still on board in the <year> – <num> season aston villa scored just <num> goals in <num> league games the lowest in premier league history and lambert was sacked on <num> february <year>
tim sherwood succeeded him and saved aston villa from relegation while also leading them to the <year> fa cup final but he was sacked in the <year> – <num> season as was his successor rémi garde
eric black took temporary charge of the team but was not able to prevent villa from being relegated for the first time since <year>
on <num> june <year> roberto di matteo was announced as the club 's new manager
they were the original wearers of the claret and blue
villa 's colours at the outset generally comprised plain shirts white grey or a shade of blue with either white or black shorts
for a few years after that <year> – <num> the team wore several different kits from all white blue and black red and blue to plain green
by <year> black jerseys with a red lion embroidered on the chest were introduced by william mcgregor
this remained the first choice strip for six years
on monday <num> november <year> an entry in the club 's official minute book states i proposed and seconded that the colours be chocolate and sky blue shirts and that we order two dozen
ii proposed and seconded that mr mcgregor be requested to supply them at the lowest quotation
the chocolate colour later became claret
nobody is quite sure why claret and blue became the club 's adopted colours
several other english football teams adopted their colours clubs that wear claret and blue include west ham united and burnley
a new badge was revealed in may <year> for the <year> – <num> season and beyond
the new badge includes a star to represent the european cup win in <year> and has a light blue background behind villa 's lion rampant
the traditional motto prepared remains in the badge and the name aston villa has been shortened to avfc fc having been omitted from the previous badge
the lion is now unified as opposed to fragmented lions of the past
randy lerner petitioned fans to help with the design of the new badge
on <num> april <year> the club confirmed that it will be using a new badge from the <year> – <num> season after consulting fan groups for suggestions
the lion in the new badge will have claws added to it and the word prepared will be removed to increase the size of the lion and club initials in the badge

the sale was completed on <num> june <year> for a reported £ <num> million after being approved by the football league with the club becoming part of recon group 's sport leisure and tourism division
recon group were selected to take over aston villa following a selection process by the club
in a first for the premier league aston villa donated the front of the shirt on their kit usually reserved for high @-@ paying sponsorships to acorns hospice so that the charity would gain significant additional visibility and greater fund raising capabilities
outside of the shirt sponsorship the club have paid for hospice care for the charity as well as regularly providing player visits to hospice locations
in september <year> aston villa launched an initiative at villa park called villa midlands food vmf where the club will spend two years training students with aston villa hospitality and events in association with birmingham city council

this includes the official aston villa supporters club which also has many smaller regional and international sections
there were several independent supporters clubs during the reign of doug ellis but most of these disbanded after his retirement
the supporter group my old man said formed to stand up for villa supporter 's rights as a direct result of villa supporters protest against the club 's appointment of alex mcleish
the club 's supporters also publish fanzines such as heroes and villains and the holy trinity

she was the first baby gorilla successfully born in captivity in new york
months after her much publicized birth pattycake 's arm was broken when it got stuck in her cage as her mother grabbed her away from her father
the incident was sensationally anthropomorphized in the media as a domestic dispute between lulu and kongo but in reality experts thought it was a simple accident
her injury was treated at the bronx zoo while a custody dispute between the two zoos broke out in public and elicited a range of opinions from experts who believed pattycake should be returned to her mother
intense media coverage and public interest brought pattycake to the attention of a wide audience with stories focusing on her recovery her eventual reunion with her parents and the conditions of zoo animals in central park
an ambitious proposal for renovating the central park zoo arose in the wake of the controversy while the zoo received record attendance rates
pattycake was the child star of new york city in the early <num> and her fame was compared to shirley temple
at a time when new york city was facing many problems she distracted the public from their growing anxieties and became a welcome relief for new yorkers and their children who loved to visit her
after spending the first decade of her life at the central park zoo pattycake moved permanently to the bronx zoo in <year>
she was the mother of ten baby gorillas including twins born in <year>
pattycake spent her later life as an independent but caring troop matriarch in the bronx zoo 's congo gorilla forest exhibit
after suffering from arthritis and cardiac problems for some time pattycake succumbed to heart disease in <year>
lulu and kongo first arrived at the zoo on may <num> <year>
at the time it was thought that lulu wasn 't mature enough to conceive so when lulu gave birth to pattycake at the age of <num> it came as a surprise
up until the time lulu gave birth it had been very difficult to get captive gorilla mothers to raise their young in zoos because the babies would either be rejected by the mother or they would be taken away by the handlers
pattycake was the first gorilla successfully born in captivity in new york
at the time of her birth it was unknown if she was a male or female as it was considered too dangerous to approach her and her parents
her handlers assumed she was a male and originally named her sonny jim
when it was established that pattycake was a female a contest was held by the new york daily news to find her a name
patty cake the winning entry was submitted by new york fireman john o 'connor who named the gorilla after his wife and a proposed daughter
it just so happens that we have three boys and i told my wife that if we ever have a girl we should name her patty which happens to be her name
i thought we 'd let the baby gorilla use the name in the meantime o 'connor told reporters
pattycake 's birth caught the attention of the city and brought crowds of thousands of new yorkers to the central park zoo
reporter n
r
kleinfield called her a child star whose furry face served as a bit of a respite at a time when the city found itself grappling with high crime rates and an intensifying financial crisis
six months after pattycake was born the director of the zoo estimated that based on the crowds she might draw an additional <num> @,@ <num> visitors by the time of her first birthday
on march <num> <year> an accident occurred that was attributed more to clumsiness than to parenting skills
although no staff were on hand to see it directly according to visitors while little pattycake was reaching out to her father through the bars of her cage her right arm became stuck somehow when her mother lulu pulled her away breaking her right arm
zoo handlers had to subdue lulu with a tranquilizer dart to remove pattycake and treat her injury
while experts considered the incident an accident the media sensationalized the event
zookeeper veronica nelson who worked with patty cake recalled that the news media would have liked to have it a dramatic bloody mess — a struggle between mom and pop for the custody of the child
it was nothing like that
it was a simple accident
kongo was in one part of the double cage lulu in another and between them was a partition of narrow bars
lulu had patty cake in her arms and when patty reached in between the narrow bars to touch her father lulu suddenly pulled her away
but patty 's arm got caught in the narrow bars and broke
it was a freak accident
no one ever realized that those bars were narrow enough to catch that tiny arm
pattycake was brought to new york medical college for surgery and she was given a cast for her arm
due to concerns that lulu would try to remove pattycake 's cast she was separated from her mother and moved to the bronx zoo for convalescence
pattycake was treated by veterinarian emil dolensek who later replaced her cast with a sling
after an examination the staff discovered that pattycake had intestinal parasites and determined she was underfed
they also believed that as a result of the incident lulu wasn 't capable as a mother
a custody dispute began between the two zoos with the bronx zoo arguing that she would be better cared for in their facilities
time magazine noted that it was the custody battle of the decade in the primate world comparing patty cake 's popularity and fame to that of child star shirley temple
developmental biologist ronald nadler of the yerkes national primate research center was brought in to arbitrate the dispute and published a report that favored returning pattycake to her mother and the central park zoo
in his report nadler noted that the recommendation is based on the judgment that an infant gorilla is more likely to develop into a socially competent and reproductively adequate animal if it is raised in the company of its parents as opposed to being raised with a group of peers
after three months recuperating from her injuries pattycake was returned to her mother on june <num> <year>
the entire incident was documented by artist susan green in her book gentle gorilla the story of patty cake <year>
s
the humane society of the united states the friends of the zoo and the society for animal rights decried the prison @-@ like conditions of the cages and called for changes
the new york zoological society which was responsible for creating realistic habitat enclosures at the bronx zoo also began calling for changes and for pattycake to be moved to another zoo
a renovation plan for the central park zoo was approved in <year> with plans made to move the gorillas to larger spaces in other zoos
the new york times reported that the caging of these animals in inadequate spaces has long enraged animal lovers
when the zoo was finally closed for renovations in <year> pattycake was moved to the bronx zoo
for a few years she lived in a cage with pansy a chimpanzee
in june <year> pattycake moved into the wildlife conservation society 's <num> million congo gorilla forest exhibit
the exhibit includes a great gorilla forest viewing area that separates gorillas and visitors with a glass window
two troops of gorillas inhabited the <num>
<num> acre exhibit with a dozen gorillas in pattycake 's troop alone including fubo pattycake tunko triska halima fran layla kumi suki babatunde barbara and m 'domo
the general curator of the bronx zoo james doherty described pattycake as independent with few close friends in the congo gorilla forest
it may have something to do with the fact that she didn 't live with her parents that long and lived with that chimpanzee for a few years doherty said
tumai was sired by bendera
pattycake and bendera had a second baby on march <num> <year> but it died soon after birth
with barney pattycake gave birth to three babies a female named paki on may <num> <year> followed by patrick on april <num> <year> and husani on december <num> <year>
paki gave birth to pattycake 's only grandchild pendeka in <year>
in october <year> a silverback named timmy <year> – <year> was taken away from kate his infertile companion at the cleveland metroparks zoo in the hopes of breeding lowland gorillas and introducing new genes into the captive gorilla gene pool
this forced separation led to protests from animal rights activists who expressed concerns about the potential consequences of emotional trauma on the two gorillas
the association of zoos and aquariums species survival plan sent timmy to the bronx zoo where he joined pattycake and other females
on july <num> <year> pattycake and timmy gave birth to okpara a male gorilla
the pair also gave birth to twin males ngoma and tambo on august <num> <year>
it was the sixth time western lowland gorillas had given birth to twins in captivity
the twins were raised in a separate habitat by surrogate mothers

l
indigo grows on the ground in both deciduous and coniferous forests where it forms mycorrhizal associations with a broad range of trees
the fruit body color ranges from dark blue in fresh specimens to pale blue @-@ gray in older ones
the milk or latex that oozes when the mushroom tissue is cut or broken — a feature common to all members of the lactarius genus — is also indigo blue but slowly turns green upon exposure to air
the cap has a diameter of <num> to <num> cm <num> to <num> in and the stem is <num> to <num> cm <num>
<num> to <num> in tall and <num> to <num>
<num> cm <num>
<num> to <num>
<num> in thick
it is an edible mushroom and is sold in rural markets in china guatemala and mexico
german botanist otto kuntze called it lactifluus indigo in his <year> treatise revisio generum plantarum but the suggested name change was not adopted by others
hesler and smith in their <year> study of north american species of lactarius defined l
indigo as the type species of subsection caerulei a group characterized by blue latex and a sticky blue cap
in <year> they revised their opinions on the organization of subdivisions in the genus lactarius and instead placed l
indigo in subgenus lactarius based on the color of latex and the subsequent color changes observed after exposure to air
as they explained the gradual development of blue to violet pigmentation as one progresses from species to species is an interesting phenomenon deserving further study
the climax is reached in l
indigo which is blue throughout
l
chelidonium and its variety chelidonioides l
paradoxus and l
hemicyaneus may be considered as mileposts along the road to l
indigo
the specific epithet indigo is derived from the latin word meaning indigo blue
its names in the english vernacular include the indigo milk cap the indigo lactarius the blue milk mushroom and the blue lactarius
in central mexico it is known as añil azul hongo azul zuin and zuine it is also called quexque meaning blue in veracruz and puebla
indigo develops from a nodule or pinhead that forms within the underground mycelium a mass of threadlike fungal cells called hyphae that make up the bulk of the organism
under appropriate environmental conditions of temperature humidity and nutrient availability the visible reproductive structures fruit bodies are formed
the cap of the fruit body measuring between <num> and <num> cm <num>
<num> and <num>
<num> in in diameter is initially convex and later develops a central depression in age it becomes even more deeply depressed becoming somewhat funnel @-@ shaped as the edge of the cap lifts upward
the margin of the cap is rolled inwards when young but unrolls and elevates as it matures
the cap surface is indigo blue when fresh but fades to a paler grayish- or silvery @-@ blue sometimes with greenish splotches
it is often zonate marked with concentric lines that form alternating pale and darker zones and the cap may have dark blue spots especially towards the edge
young caps are sticky to the touch
the flesh is pallid to bluish in color slowly turning greenish after being exposed to air its taste is mild to slightly acrid
the flesh of the entire mushroom is brittle and the stem if bent sufficiently will snap open cleanly
the latex exuded from injured tissue is indigo blue and stains the wounded tissue greenish like the flesh the latex has a mild taste
lactarius indigo is noted for not producing as much latex as other lactarius species and older specimens in particular may be too dried out to produce any latex
the gills of the mushroom range from adnate squarely attached to the stem to slightly decurrent running down the length of the stem and crowded close together
their color is an indigo blue becoming paler with age or staining green with damage
the stem is <num> – <num> cm <num>
<num> – <num>
<num> in tall by <num> – <num>
<num> cm <num>
<num> – <num>
<num> in thick and the same diameter throughout or sometimes narrowed at base
its color is indigo blue to silvery- or grayish blue
the interior of the stem is solid and firm initially but develops a hollow with age
like the cap it is initially sticky or slimy to the touch when young but soon dries out
its attachment to the cap is usually in a central position although it may also be off @-@ center
fruit bodies of l
indigo have no distinguishable odor

<num> – <num>
<num> cm <num>
<num> – <num>
<num> in thick
it is often seen in virginia
hesler and smith who first described the variant based on specimens found in brazoria county texas described its typical habitat as along the sides of a muddy ditch under grasses and weeds with loblolly pine nearby
viewed with a light microscope the spores are translucent hyaline elliptical to nearly spherical in shape with amyloid warts and have dimensions of <num> – <num> by <num>
<num> – <num>
<num> µm
scanning electron microscopy reveals reticulations on the spore surface
the hymenium is the spore @-@ producing tissue layer of the fruit body and consists of hyphae that extend into the gills and terminate as end cells
various cell types can be observed in the hymenium and the cells have microscopic characteristics that may be used to help identify or distinguish species in cases where the macroscopic characters may be ambiguous
the spore @-@ bearing cells the basidia are four @-@ spored and measure <num> – <num> µm long by <num> – <num> µm wide at the thickest point
cystidia are terminal cells of hyphae in the hymenium which do not produce spores and function in aiding spore dispersal and maintaining favorable humidity around developing spores
the pleurocystidia are cystidia that are found on the face of a gill they are <num> – <num> by <num>
<num> – <num> µm roughly spindle @-@ shaped and have a constricted apex
the cheilocystidia — located on the edge of a gill — are abundant and are <num>

other lactarius species with some blue color include the silver @-@ blue milky l
paradoxus found in eastern north america which has a grayish @-@ blue cap when young but it has reddish @-@ brown to purple @-@ brown latex and gills
l
chelidonium has a yellowish to dingy yellow @-@ brown to bluish @-@ gray cap and yellowish to brown latex
l
quieticolor has blue @-@ colored flesh in the cap and orange to red @-@ orange flesh in the base of the stem
although the blue discoloration of l
indigo is thought to be rare in the genus lactarius in <year> five new species were reported from peninsular malaysia with bluing latex or flesh including l
cyanescens l
lazulinus l
mirabilis and two species still unnamed
indigo is a well @-@ known edible species opinions vary on its desirability
for example american mycologist david arora considers it a superior edible while a field guide on kansas fungi rates it as mediocre in quality
it may have a slightly bitter or peppery taste and has a coarse grainy texture
the firm flesh is best prepared by cutting the mushroom in thin slices
the blue color disappears with cooking and the mushroom becomes grayish
because of the granular texture of the flesh it does not lend itself well to drying
specimens producing copious quantities of milk may be used to add color to marinades
in mexico individuals harvest the wild mushrooms for sale at farmers markets typically from june to november they are considered a second class species for consumption
l
indigo is also sold in guatemalan markets from may to october
it is one of <num> lactarius species sold at rural markets in yunnan in southwestern china

indigo is distributed throughout southern and eastern north america but is most common along the gulf coast mexico and guatemala
its frequency of appearance in the appalachian mountains of the united states has been described as occasional to locally common
mycologist david arora notes that in the united states the species is found with ponderosa pine in arizona but is absent in california 's ponderosa pine forests
it has also been collected from china india guatemala and costa rica in forests dominated by oak
in europe it has so far only been found in southern france
a study on the seasonal appearance of fruiting bodies in the subtropical forests of xalapa mexico confirmed that maximal production coincided with the rainy season between june and september
l
indigo is a mycorrhizal fungus and as such establishes a mutualistic relationship with the roots of certain trees hosts in which the fungi exchange minerals and amino acids extracted from the soil for fixed carbon from the host
the subterranean hyphae of the fungus grow a sheath of tissue around the rootlets of a broad range of tree species forming so @-@ called ectomycorrhizae — an intimate association that is especially beneficial to the host as the fungus produces enzymes that mineralize organic compounds and facilitate the transfer of nutrients to the tree
reflecting their close relationships with trees the fruit bodies of l
indigo are typically found growing on the ground scattered or in groups in both deciduous and coniferous forests
they are also commonly found in floodplain areas that have been recently submerged
in mexico associations have been noted with mexican alder american hornbeam american hophornbeam and liquidambar macrophylla while in guatemala the mushroom associates with smooth @-@ bark mexican pine and other pine and oak species
in costa rica the species forms associations with several native oaks of the quercus genus
under controlled laboratory conditions l

filming for the episode was scheduled to begin on july <num> <year>
the episode is the first to fully employ the five @-@ year jump which was introduced in the final two minutes of the fourth season finale
while developing the fifth season cherry began brainstorming ways to revamp the series
he stated the soap tends to build up and i wanted to get back to where we were that very first season where it 's just the problems of some ordinary women and they were small and relatable
cherry credits the producers of lost for the idea of the time jump
the writers hoped the time jump would also help them avoid repeating mistakes they made during the show 's poorly received second season during which they relied heavily on storylines from the previous season
cherry said that the time jump would be permanent with executive producer bob daily clarifying that some brief flashback scenes would be used to enhance the storytelling and provide context for current plot lines
cherry had originally wanted to do a ten @-@ year jump mostly to age the young characters into their teenage years in order to open up more storyline possibilities
the writers ensured that although they were changing the storyline circumstances the characters remained the same with minimal changes to their personalities
according to series writer matt berry the time jump allowed the writers to work with the characters without most of the baggage they ’ d accumulated in the earlier years and put them into starting places so we could move them forward and build in new story arcs
for this reason the writers treated the season premiere as a pilot in which according to daily they could give the women a new drive
daily identified the susan character as having undergone the greatest change stating that she has given up on looking for a fairy @-@ tale romance and is emotionally distant in her new relationship
he also stated that the character of gabrielle has dealt with the biggest change in terms of her circumstances as she continues to deal with her husband 's blindness and their financial problems
actress eva longoria had to gain weight and wear additional body padding for her character 's new storyline
dana delany stated that her character katherine who was portrayed as an antiheroine in the previous season is more relaxed following the time jump
however delany clarified that while katherine is now friends with the other characters she and bree would become frenemies as a result of their business partnership
nicollette sheridan commented that edie who played an integral role in the season 's mystery story arch is a lot more conscientious about things this season without losing her comedic edge

the kinsman twins appeared in a flashback in this episode
joshua logan moore was cast as parker a role previously played by zane huett and kendall applegate joined the cast as penny who had previously been portrayed by several toddler actresses
despite their casting announcements alongside the carver twins moore and applegate did not appear in you 're gonna love tomorrow
the flashforward segment at the end of the fourth season also introduced kaila say and daniella baltodano as gabrielle 's daughters juanita and celia respectively
only baltodano continued portraying her role for the fifth season say was replaced by madison de la garza during the summer hiatus
andrea bowen who starred as susan 's daughter julie departed from the cast as her character left for college at the end of the fourth season
teri hatcher expressed disappointment in the producers decision but cherry stated that bowen would return in the future
joy lauren who portrayed bree 's daughter danielle and lyndsy fonseca who played katherine 's daughter dylan also left the main cast although the former appeared in the season premiere as a guest star
because the fourth season ended leaving mike 's whereabouts unknown james denton 's return to the series was questioned during hiatus

tanner stransky of entertainment weekly called the five @-@ year jump a stroke of genius effectively increasing our insight into these ladies world by twofold
he called the gabrielle storyline a true depiction of motherhood and applauded the scene in which carlos and gabrielle discuss her low self @-@ esteem
he complimented the bree storyline particularly the argument scene between bree and katherine
he enjoyed the dave storyline but expressed disappointment that edie 's reappearance was the only scene that involved all of the leading women
additionally stransky was not intrigued by lynette 's storyline and deemed it more of the same for the character
he criticized susan 's storyline calling it annoying
he also dismissed the writers ploy to give viewers the impression that mike had died for almost the entire episode
tv guide 's matt roush gave the episode an a stating moving the story ahead five years didn 't so much reinvent the show as it recharged and refreshed the scintillating mix of domestic comedy and sudsy intrigue that we 've always enjoyed
he highlighted the comedic gabrielle storyline while approving the additions of mcdonough and harold to the cast
in his review of the first two episodes of the season brian lowry of variety said that while you 're gonna love tomorrow is satisfactory and establishes the five @-@ year jump effectively the second episode is better calling it a knock @-@ out
entertainment weekly 's ken tucker commended the time jump as a reflection of both the characters and series ambitions rating the episode a b
joanna weiss of the boston globe gave the episode a mixed review
she said that the time leap proved to be successful as the show had been flailing for several seasons and concluded that so far at least this season promises to be less about plot than personality
that doesn 't mean the show is perfect it never was but it 's better and that 's a big relief
the pittsburgh post @-@ gazette 's rob owen was positive in his review noting that the writers handled the five @-@ year leap well especially in regards to lynette 's storyline
he complimented the episode 's comedy and expressed his hope that the time jump would allow the writers to focus on humor rather than overly @-@ dramatic storylines
it was first broadcast on the fox network in the united states on december <num> <year>
in the episode homer is banned from moe 's tavern and struggles to find a new bar
when he destroys a plane after being mistaken for a pilot at a pilots @-@ only bar the airline buys the simpsons silence with free tickets
the family discovers that marge is afraid of flying
the episode was directed by mark kirkland and written by david sacks
it features numerous guest stars including anne bancroft as dr
zweig
additionally ted danson woody harrelson rhea perlman john ratzenberger and george wendt appear as their characters from cheers
it received positive reception from television critics and acquired a nielsen rating of <num>
<num>
the authors of i can 't believe it 's a bigger and better updated unofficial simpsons guide commented positively on the episode as did reviews from dvd verdict and dvd movie guide
looking for another place to drink including the cheers bar homer eventually settles for an airline pilots bar but is mistaken for a pilot despite confessing that he 's not really a pilot and is put in the cockpit of an airplane which he promptly wrecks after raising the stationary plane 's landing gear
in exchange for his silence of the mistake they 've made the airline gives the simpson family free tickets to anywhere they desire in the continental united states
however the idea of plane travel fills marge with anxiety as she has a fear of flying and after numerous failed attempts to get out of the trip she eventually has a panic attack on the plane following which the trip is postponed
marge does not want to talk to anybody about her fear and lisa worries that marge 's decision to keep her feelings bottled up will cause them to come out in other ways
when marge begins to show signs of her lingering flight @-@ related trauma by insisting the cat and the dog are living in sin cooking giant feasts and shingling the roof in the middle of the night lisa convinces marge to undergo treatment with therapist dr
zweig
homer however grows increasingly paranoid about marge 's therapy believing that zweig will blame marge 's trauma on him and encourage her to leave him
zweig uncovers the roots of marge 's fear the moment she realized her father was not a pilot but an apron @-@ wearing flight attendant a job that was mostly reserved for women at the time
her shame is eased when zweig assures her that male flight attendants are now very common and that her father could be considered a pioneer
marge also brings up memories of her grandmother poking her in the eye as a baby while playing airplane a toy plane catching fire and having a plane fire at her and her mother but zweig just ignores them
before the therapist begins to question marge 's marriage homer immediately takes marge away and marge manages to thank zweig for helping her
marge is finally cured of her fears but when she and homer attempt to fly on a plane again the plane crashes into a lake
the story of the episode came about when sacks came into the writers room with an idea for an episode where marge goes to a therapist for one reason or another
sacks and the other writers then structured the rest of the plot around that storyline
anne bancroft was called in to voice zweig
before bancroft recorded her part the animators based zweig 's design on a temp track from cast member tress macneille as the therapist
after bancroft had recorded her part zweig was redesigned to fit with bancroft 's voice
they added split glasses and a streak of silver in her hair to give her a more mature look
after homer was kicked out of moe 's tavern it was originally planned for a cat to come to homer and then have it enter the bar
the result is the barflies loving the cat and depressing homer even more
according to david silverman the fact that it looked depressing was the reason why it was deleted and replaced with a more humorous approach with him chasing a poodle
the staff was able to get the central cast of the american sitcom cheers with the exception of kelsey grammer to reunite and guest star in the episode
the staff could not arrange the script to allow time in the episode for grammer who already had a recurring role on the simpsons as sideshow bob to voice frasier crane
ted danson guest starred as sam woody harrelson as woody rhea perlman as carla john ratzenberger as cliff and george wendt as norm
all of the speaking characters are voiced by the actors who played them in cheers
ironically frasier crane remains silent despite being played by simpsons veteran kelsey grammer the voice of sideshow bob
marge 's dream sees her in the role of mrs
robinson from lost in space while homer plays dr
smith
the scene where marge and jacqueline bouvier duck down when a biplane shoots at them in a cornfield is a parody of alfred hitchcock 's film north by northwest
homer 's mount lushmore caricature resembles eustace tilley the mascot of the new yorker
homer 's line about getting out of springfield is lifted from it 's a wonderful life while homer 's all @-@ time favorite song is revealed to be it 's raining men by the weather girls
when abe simpson is left behind on the plane his slapping his hands on his face and yelling is a reference to home alone
this is the second time home alone has been parodied on the simpsons
the first was homer alone a reference to the title
as homer is looking for a place to drink he tries a lesbian bar the she she lounge
however he soon realizes that this lesbian bar doesn 't have a fire exit
he then leaves saying enjoy your deathtrap ladies
this is a reference to a famous greenwich village gay bar the stonewall inn
this mafia @-@ owned and -run bar had no rear exit so if there had been a fire on a weekend night hundreds of customers would have had to escape through a single narrow passage leading to the front door
the films homer rents are hero fearless and alive the latter of which marge watches
all of them involve plane crashes
when marge leaves dr
zweig 's office she says whenever the wind whistles through the leaves i 'll think lowenstein lowenstein …
this is a reference to the prince of tides the psychiatrist is dr
lowenstein

since airing the episode has received many positive reviews from fans and television critics
in july <year> simon crerar of the times listed the cheers cast 's performance as one of the thirty @-@ three funniest cameos in the history of the show
warren martyn and adrian wood the authors of the book i can 't believe it 's a bigger and better updated unofficial simpsons guide said it was a good marge @-@ centric episode with plenty of clever set pieces – the tributes to cheers and lost in space are fantastic and noted that marge 's father looks suspiciously like moe

fear of flying was again included in the <year> dvd release of the same set
it was included in the simpsons season <num> dvd set which was released on august <num> <year> as the simpsons – the complete sixth season
despite his dense and difficult prose innis was one of canada 's most original thinkers
he helped develop the staples thesis which holds that canada 's culture political history and economy have been decisively influenced by the exploitation and export of a series of staples such as fur fishing lumber wheat mined metals and coal
the staple thesis dominated economic history in canada <num> @-@ <num> and is still used by some
innis 's writings on communication explore the role of media in shaping the culture and development of civilizations
he argued for example that a balance between oral and written forms of communication contributed to the flourishing of greek civilization in the <num> century bc
he warned however that western civilization is now imperiled by powerful advertising @-@ driven media obsessed by present @-@ mindedness and the continuous systematic ruthless destruction of elements of permanence essential to cultural activity
his intellectual bond with eric a
havelock formed the foundations of the “ toronto school of communication ” which provided a source of inspiration for future members of the school marshall mcluhan and edmund snow carpenter
innis laid the basis for scholarship that looked at the social sciences from a distinctly canadian point of view
as the head of the university of toronto 's political economy department he worked to build up a cadre of canadian scholars so that universities would not continue to rely as heavily on british or american @-@ trained professors unfamiliar with canada 's history and culture
he was successful in establishing sources of financing for canadian scholarly research
as the cold war grew hotter after <year> innis grew increasingly hostile to the united states
he warned repeatedly that canada was becoming a subservient colony to its much more powerful southern neighbor
we are indeed fighting for our lives he warned pointing especially to the pernicious influence of american advertising
we can only survive by taking persistent action at strategic points against american imperialism in all its attractive guises
his anti @-@ americanism influenced some younger scholars including donald creighton
innis also tried to defend universities from political and economic pressures
he believed that independent universities as centres of critical thought were essential to the survival of western civilization
his intellectual disciple and university colleague marshall mcluhan lamented innis 's premature death as a disastrous loss for human understanding
mcluhan wrote i am pleased to think of my own book the gutenberg galaxy as a footnote to the observations of innis on the subject of the psychic and social consequences first of writing then of printing
as a boy he loved the rhythms and routines of farm life and he never forgot his rural origins
his mother mary adams innis had named him herald hoping he would become a minister in the strict evangelical baptist faith that she and her husband william shared
at the time the baptist church was an important part of life in rural areas
it gave isolated families a sense of community and embodied the values of individualism and independence
its far @-@ flung congregations were not ruled by a centralized bureaucratic authority
innis became an agnostic in later life but never lost his interest in religion
according to his friend and biographer donald creighton innis 's character was moulded by the church the strict sense of values and the feeling of devotion to a cause which became so characteristic of him in later life were derived in part at least from the instruction imparted so zealously and unquestioningly inside the severely unadorned walls of the baptist church at otterville
innis attended the one @-@ room schoolhouse in otterville and the community 's high school
he travelled <num> miles <num> km by train to woodstock ontario to complete his secondary education at a baptist @-@ run college
he intended to become a public @-@ school teacher and passed the entrance examinations for teacher training but decided to take a year off to earn the money he would need to support himself at an ontario teachers college
at age <num> therefore he returned to the one @-@ room schoolhouse at otterville to teach for one term until the local school board could recruit a fully qualified teacher
the experience made him realize that the life of a teacher in a small rural school was not for him
mcmaster was a natural choice for him because it was a baptist university and many students who attended woodstock college went there
mcmaster 's liberal arts professors encouraged critical thinking and debate
innis was especially influenced by james ten broeke the university 's one @-@ man philosophy department
ten broeke posed an essay question that innis pondered for the rest of his life why do we attend to the things to which we attend before his final undergraduate year at mcmaster innis spent a summer teaching at the northern star school in the frontier farming community of landonville near vermilion alberta
the experience gave him a sense of the vastness of canada
he also learned about western grievances over high interest rates and steep transportation costs
in his final undergraduate year innis focused on history and economics
he kept in mind a remark made by history lecturer w
s
wallace that the economic interpretation of history was not the only possible one but that it went the deepest
he was sent to france in the fall of <year> to fight in the first world war
trench warfare with its mud and lice and rats had a devastating effect on him
innis 's role as an artillery signaller gave him firsthand experience of life and death on the front lines as he participated in the successful canadian attack on vimy ridge
signallers or spotters watched where each artillery shell landed then sent back aiming corrections so that the next shells could hit their targets more accurately
on july <num> <year> innis received a serious shrapnel wound in his right thigh that required eight months of hospital treatment in england
innis 's war was over
his biographer john watson notes the physical wound took seven years to heal but the psychological damage lasted a lifetime
innis suffered recurring bouts of depression and nervous exhaustion because of his military service
watson also notes that the great war influenced innis 's intellectual outlook
it strengthened his canadian nationalism sharpened his opinion of what he thought were the destructive effects of technology including the communications media that were used so effectively to sell the war and led him for the first time to doubt his baptist faith
his thesis called the returned soldier was a detailed description of the public policy measures that were necessary not only to provide a supportive milieu to help veterans get over the effects of the war but also to move on with national reconstruction
innis did his postgraduate work at the university of chicago and was awarded his phd in august <year>
his two years at chicago had a profound influence on his later work
his interest in economics deepened and he decided to become a professional economist
the economics faculty at chicago questioned abstract and universalist neoclassical theories then in vogue arguing that general rules for economic policy should be derived from specific case studies
innis was influenced by the university 's two eminent communications scholars george herbert mead and robert e
park
although he did not attend any of these famous professors classes innis did absorb their idea that communication involved much more than the transmission of information
james w
carey writes that mead and park characterized communication as the entire process whereby a culture is brought into existence maintained in time and sedimented into institutions
while at chicago innis was exposed to the ideas of thorstein veblen the iconoclastic thinker who drew on his deep knowledge of philosophy and economics to write scathing critiques of contemporary thought and culture
veblen had left chicago years before but his ideas were still strongly felt there
years later in an essay on veblen innis praised him for waging war against standardized static economics
innis got his first taste of university teaching at chicago where he delivered several introductory economics courses
one of his students was mary quayle the woman he would marry in may <year> when he was <num> and she <num>
together they had four children donald <year> mary <year> hugh <year> and ann <year>
mary quayle innis was herself a notable economist and writer
her book an economic history of canada was published in <year>
her novel stand on a rainbow appeared in <year>
her other books include mrs
simcoe 's diary <year> the clear spirit canadian women and their times <year> and unfold the years <year> a history of the young women 's christian association
she also edited harold innis 's posthumous essays in canadian economic history <year> and a <year> reissue of his empire and communications
the completion of canada 's first transcontinental railway in <year> had been a defining moment in canadian history
innis 's thesis eventually published as a book in <year> can be seen as an early attempt to document the railway 's significance from an economic historian 's point of view
it uses voluminous statistics to underpin its arguments
innis maintains that the difficult and expensive construction project was sustained by fears of american annexation of the canadian west
innis argues that the history of the canadian pacific railroad is primarily the history of the spread of western civilization over the northern half of the north american continent
as robert babe notes the railway brought industrialization transporting coal and building supplies to manufacturing sites
it was also a kind of communications medium that contributed to the spread of european civilization
babe writes that for innis the cpr 's equipment comprised a massive energy @-@ consuming fast @-@ moving powerful capital @-@ intensive sign dropped into the very midst of indigenous peoples whose entire way of life was disrupted and eventually shattered as a result
communications scholar arthur kroker argues that innis 's study of the canadian pacific railway was only the first in which he attempted to demonstrate that technology is not something external to canadian being but on the contrary is the necessary condition and lasting consequence of canadian existence
it also reflected innis 's lifelong interest in the exercise of economic and political power
his cpr history ends for example with a recounting of western grievances against economic policies such as high freight rates and the steep import tariffs designed to protect fledgling canadian manufacturers
westerners complained that this national policy funnelled money from prairie farmers into the pockets of the eastern business establishment
western canada innis wrote has paid for the development of canadian nationality and it would appear that it must continue to pay
the acquisitiveness of eastern canada shows little sign of abatement
it holds that canada 's culture political history and economy have been decisively shaped by the exploitation and export of a series of staples such as fur fish wood wheat mined metals and fossil fuels
innis theorized that this reliance on exporting natural resources made canada dependent on more industrially advanced countries and resulted in periodic disruptions to economic life as the international demand for staples rose and fell as the staple itself became increasingly scarce and as technological change resulted in shifts from one staple to others
innis pointed out for example that as furs became scarce and trade in that staple declined it became necessary to develop and export other staples such as wheat potash and especially lumber
the export of these new staples was made possible through improved transportation networks that included first canals and later railways
he was assigned to teach courses in commerce economic history and economic theory
he decided to focus his scholarly research on canadian economic history a hugely neglected subject and he settled on the fur trade as his first area of study
furs had brought french and english traders to canada motivating them to travel west along the continent 's interlocking lake and river systems to the pacific coast
innis realized that he would not only need to search out archival documents to understand the history of the fur trade but would also have to travel the country himself gathering masses of firsthand information and accumulating what he called dirt experience
thus innis travelled extensively beginning in the summer of <year> when he and a friend paddled an <num> @-@ foot <num>
<num> m canvas @-@ covered canoe hundreds of miles down the peace river to lake athabasca then down the slave river to great slave lake
they completed their journey down the mackenzie canada 's longest river to the arctic ocean on a small hudson 's bay company tug
during his travels innis supplemented his fur research by gathering information on other staple products such as lumber pulp and paper minerals grain and fish
he travelled so extensively that by the early <num> he had visited every part of canada except for the western arctic and the east side of hudson bay
everywhere innis went his methods were the same he interviewed people connected with the production of staple products and listened to their stories
the book chronicles the trade in beaver fur from the early <num> century to the <num>
instead of focusing on the heroic european adventurers who explored the canadian wilderness as conventional histories had done innis documents how the interplay of geography technology and economic forces shaped both the fur trade and canada 's political and economic destiny
he concludes that the fur trade largely determined canada 's boundaries adding that the country emerged not in spite of geography but because of it
the fur trade in canada also describes the cultural interactions among three groups of people the europeans in fashionable metropolitan centres who regarded beaver hats as luxury items the european colonial settlers who saw beaver fur as a staple that could be exported to pay for essential manufactured goods from the home country and first nations peoples who traded furs for industrial goods such as metal pots knives guns and liquor
innis describes the central role first nations peoples played in the development of the fur trade
without their skilled hunting techniques knowledge of the territory and advanced tools such as snowshoes toboggans and birch @-@ bark canoes the fur trade would not have existed
however dependence on european technologies disrupted first nations societies
the new technology with its radical innovations innis writes brought about such a rapid shift in the prevailing indian culture as to lead to wholesale destruction of the peoples concerned by warfare and disease
historian carl berger argues that by placing first nations culture at the centre of his analysis of the fur trade innis was the first to explain adequately the disintegration of native society under the thrust of european capitalism
unlike many historians who see canadian history as beginning with the arrival of europeans innis emphasizes the cultural and economic contributions of first nations peoples
we have not yet realized he writes that the indian and his culture was fundamental to the growth of canadian institutions
the fur trade in canada concludes by arguing that canadian economic history can best be understood by examining how one staple product gave way to another — furs to timber for example and the later importance of wheat and minerals
reliance on staples made canada economically dependent on more industrially advanced countries and the cyclonic shifts from one staple to another caused frequent disruptions in the country 's economic life
the result was the cod fisheries the history of an international economy published in <year> <num> years after the fur trade study
innis tells the detailed history of competing empires in the exploitation of a teeming natural resource — a history that ranges over <num> years
while his study of the fur trade focused on the continental interior with its interlocking rivers and lakes the cod fisheries looks outward at global trade and empire showing the far @-@ reaching effects of one staple product both on imperial centres and on marginal colonies such as newfoundland nova scotia and new england
during the <num> innis also began studying pulp and paper an industry of central importance to the canadian economy
this research provided an additional crossover point from his work on staple products to his communications studies
biographer paul heyer writes that innis followed pulp and paper through its subsequent stages newspapers and journalism books and advertising
in other words from looking at a natural resource @-@ based industry he turned his attention to a cultural industry in which information and ultimately knowledge was a commodity that circulated had value and empowered those who controlled it
one of innis 's primary contributions to communications studies was to apply the dimensions of time and space to various media
he divided media into time @-@ binding and space @-@ binding types
time @-@ binding media are durable
they include clay or stone tablets
space @-@ binding media are more ephemeral
they include modern media such as radio television and mass circulation newspapers
innis examined the rise and fall of ancient empires as a way of tracing the effects of communications media
he looked at media that led to the growth of an empire those that sustained it during its periods of success and then the communications changes that hastened an empire 's collapse
he tried to show that media biases toward time or space affected the complex interrelationships needed to sustain an empire
these interrelationships included the partnership between the knowledge and ideas necessary to create and maintain an empire and the power or force required to expand and defend it
for innis the interplay between knowledge and power was always a crucial factor in understanding empire
innis argued that a balance between the spoken word and writing contributed to the flourishing of ancient greece in the time of plato
this balance between the time @-@ biased medium of speech and the space @-@ biased medium of writing was eventually upset innis argued as the oral tradition gave way to the dominance of writing
the torch of empire then passed from greece to rome
harold innis 's analysis of the effects of communications on the rise and fall of empires led him to warn grimly that western civilization was now facing its own profound crisis
the development of powerful communications media such as mass @-@ circulation newspapers had shifted the balance decisively in favour of space and power over time continuity and knowledge
the balance required for cultural survival had been upset by what innis saw as mechanized communications media used to transmit information quickly over long distances
these media had contributed to an obsession with present @-@ mindedness wiping out concerns about past or future
innis wrote the overwhelming pressure of mechanization evident in the newspaper and the magazine has led to the creation of vast monopolies of communication
their entrenched positions involve a continuous systematic ruthless destruction of elements of permanence essential to cultural activity
western civilization could only be saved innis argued by recovering the balance between space and time
for him that meant reinvigorating the oral tradition within universities while freeing institutions of higher learning from political and commercial pressures
in his essay a plea for time he suggested that genuine dialogue within universities could produce the critical thinking necessary to restore the balance between power and knowledge
then universities could muster the courage to attack the monopolies that always imperil civilization
although innis remains appreciated and respected for the grand and unique nature of his later efforts regarding communications theories he was not without critics
particularly the fragmentary and mosaic writing style exemplified in empire and communications has been criticized as ambiguous aggressively non @-@ linear and lacking connections between levels of analysis
biographers have suggested that this style may have been a result of innis illness late in his career
during the summers of <year> and <year> he travelled to the west to see the effects of the depression for himself
the next year in an essay entitled the canadian economy and the depression innis outlined the plight of a country susceptible to the slightest ground @-@ swell of international disturbance yet beset by regional differences that made it difficult to devise effective solutions
he described a prairie economy dependent on the export of wheat yet afflicted by severe drought on the one hand and the increased political power of canada 's growing cities sheltered from direct reliance on the staples trade on the other
the result was political conflict and a breakdown in federal – provincial relations
we lack vital information on which to base prospective policies to meet this situation innis warned because of the weak position of the social sciences in canada
innis 's reputation as a public intellectual was growing steadily and in <year> premier angus l
macdonald invited him to serve on a royal commission to examine nova scotia 's economic problems
the next year he helped establish the canadian journal of economics and political science
in <year> he was appointed a full university of toronto professor and a year later became the head of the university 's department of political economy
innis was appointed president of the canadian political science association in <year>
his inaugural address entitled the penetrative powers of the price system must have baffled his listeners as he ranged over centuries of economic history jumping abruptly from one topic to the next linking monetary developments to patterns of trade and settlement
the address was an ambitious attempt to show the disruptive effects of new technologies culminating in the modern shift from an industrial system based on coal and iron to the newest sources of industrial power electricity oil and steel
innis also tried to show the commercial effects of mass circulation newspapers made possible by expanded newsprint production and of the new medium of radio which threatens to circumvent the walls imposed by tariffs and to reach across boundaries frequently denied to other media of communication
both media innis argued stimulated the demand for consumer goods and both promoted nationalism
innis was also a central participant in an international project that produced <num> scholarly volumes between <year> and <year>
it was a series called the relations of canada and the united states overseen by james t
shotwell director of the carnegie endowment for international peace
innis edited and wrote prefaces for the volumes contributed by canadian scholars
his own study of the cod fisheries also appeared as part of the series
his work with shotwell enabled innis to gain access to carnegie money to further canadian academic research
as john watson points out the project offered one of the few sources of research funds in rather lean times
in alberta for example the radio evangelist william bible bill aberhart led his populist social credit party to victory in <year>
three years earlier in calgary alberta social reformers had founded a new political party the co @-@ operative commonwealth federation or ccf
it advocated democratic socialism and a mixed economy with public ownership of key industries
frank underhill one of innis 's colleagues at the university of toronto was a founding member of the ccf
innis and underhill had both been members of an earlier group at the university that declared itself dissatisfied with the policies of the two major political parties in canada and that aimed at forming a definite body of progressive opinion
in <year> innis presented a paper to the group on economic conditions in canada but he later recoiled from participating in party politics denouncing partisans like underhill as hot gospellers
innis maintained that scholars had no place in active politics and that instead they should devote themselves first to research on public problems and then to the production of knowledge based on critical thought
he saw the university with its emphasis on dialogue open @-@ mindedness and skepticism as an institution that could foster such thinking and research
the university could provide an environment he wrote as free as possible from the biases of the various institutions that form the state so that its intellectuals could continue to seek out and explore other perspectives
although sympathetic to the plight of western farmers and urban unemployed workers innis did not embrace socialism
eric havelock a left @-@ leaning colleague explained many years later that innis distrusted political solutions imported from elsewhere especially those based on marxist analysis with its emphasis on class conflict
he worried too that as canada 's ties with britain weakened the country would fall under the spell of american ideas instead of developing its own based on canada 's unique circumstances
havelock added he has been called the radical conservative of his day — not a bad designation of a complex mind clear sighted cautious perhaps at bottom pessimistic in areas where thinkers we would label progressive felt less difficulty in taking a stand never content to select only one or two elements in a complicated equation in order to build a quick @-@ order policy or program far ranging enough in intellect to take in the whole sum of the factors and comprehend their often contradictory effects
in <year> he helped establish the american @-@ based economic history association and its journal of economic history
he later became the association 's second president
innis played a central role in founding two important sources for the funding of academic research the canadian social science research council <year> and the humanities research council of canada <year>
in <year> the university of new brunswick awarded innis an honorary degree as did his alma mater mcmaster university
université laval the university of manitoba and the university of glasgow would also confer honorary degrees in <year> – <num>
in <year> innis spent nearly a month in the soviet union where he had been invited to attend the <num> anniversary celebrations marking the founding of the country 's academy of sciences
later in his essay reflections on russia he mused about the differences between the soviet producer economy and the west 's consumer ethos a n economy which emphasizes consumer 's goods is characterized by communication industries largely dependent on advertising and by constant efforts to reach the largest number of readers or listeners an economy emphasizing producer 's goods is characterized by communications industries largely dependent on government support
as a result of this contrast a common public opinion in russia and the west is hard to achieve
innis 's trip to moscow and leningrad came shortly before u
s
– soviet rivalry led to the hostility of the cold war
innis lamented this rise in international tensions
he saw the soviet empire as a stabilizing counterbalance to the american empire 's emphasis on commercialism the individual and constant change
for innis russia was a society within the western tradition not an alien civilization
he abhorred the nuclear arms race seeing it as the triumph of force over knowledge a modern form of the medieval inquisition
the middle ages burned its heretics he wrote and the modern age threatens them with atom bombs
in <year> innis was elected president of the royal society of canada the country 's senior body of scientists and scholars
that same year he served on the manitoba royal commission on adult education and published political economy in the modern state a collection of his speeches and essays that reflected both his staples research and his new work in communications
in <year> innis was appointed the university of toronto 's dean of graduate studies
in <year> he delivered lectures at the university of london and nottingham university
he also gave the prestigious beit lectures at oxford later published in his book empire and communications
in <year> innis was appointed as a commissioner on the federal government 's royal commission on transportation a position that involved extensive travel at a time when his health was starting to fail
the last decade of his career during which he worked on his communications studies was an unhappy time for innis
he was academically isolated because his colleagues in economics could not fathom how this new work related to his pioneering research in staples theory
biographer john watson writes that the almost complete lack of positive response to the communications works contributed to his sense of overwork and depression
innis died of prostate cancer in <year> a few days after his <num> birthday
in commemoration innis college at the university of toronto and innis library at mcmaster university were named in his honour
following his premature death innis significance increasingly deepened as scholars in several academic disciplines continued to build upon his writings
marshall poe 's general media theory that proposes two sub @-@ theories were inspired by innis
douglas c
north expanded on of innis vent for surplus theory of economic development by applying it to regional development in the united states and underdeveloped countries
in addition james w
carey adopted innis as a reference point in his conception of two models of communication
as a young english professor mcluhan was flattered when he learned that innis had put his book the mechanical bride on the reading list of the fourth @-@ year economics course
mcluhan built on innis 's idea that in studying the effects of communications media technological form mattered more than content
biographer paul heyer writes that innis 's concept of the bias of a particular medium of communication can be seen as a less flamboyant precursor to mcluhan 's legendary phrase the medium is the message
innis for example tried to show how printed media such as books or newspapers were biased toward control over space and secular power while engraved media such as stone or clay tablets were biased in favour of continuity in time and metaphysical or religious knowledge
mcluhan focused on what may be called a medium 's sensory bias arguing for example that books and newspapers appealed to the rationality of the eye while radio played to the irrationality of the ear
the differences in the innisian and mcluhanesque approaches were summarized by the late james w
carey both mcluhan and innis assume the centrality of communication technology where they differ is in the principal kinds of effects they see deriving from this technology
whereas innis sees communication technology principally affecting social organization and culture mcluhan sees its principal effect on sensory organization and thought
mcluhan has much to say about perception and thought but little to say about institutions innis says much about institutions and little about perception and thought
biographer john watson notes that innis 's work was profoundly political while mcluhan 's was not
he writes that the mechanization of knowledge not the relative sensual bias of media is the key to innis 's work
this also underlies the politicization of innis 's position vis @-@ a @-@ vis that of mcluhan
watson adds that innis believed very different media could produce similar effects
for innis the yellow press of the united states and the nazi loudspeaker had the same form of negative effect they reduced men from thinking beings to mere automatons in a chain of command
watson argues that while mcluhan separated media according to their sensory bias innis examined a different set of interrelationships the dialectic of power and knowledge in specific historical circumstances
for watson innis 's work is therefore more flexible and less deterministic than mcluhan 's
as scholars and teachers innis and mcluhan shared a similar dilemma since both argued that book culture tended to produce fixed points of view and homogeneity of thought yet both produced many books
in his introduction to the <year> reprint of the bias of communication mcluhan marvelled at innis 's technique of juxtaposing his insights in a mosaic structure of seemingly unrelated and disproportioned sentences and aphorisms
mcluhan argued that although this made reading innis 's dense prose difficult — a pattern of insights that are not packaged for the consumer palate — innis 's method approximated the natural form of conversation or dialogue rather than of written discourse
best of all it yielded insight and pattern recognition rather than the classified knowledge so overvalued by print @-@ trained scholars
how exciting it was to encounter a writer whose every phrase invited prolonged meditation and exploration mcluhan added
mcluhan 's own books with their reliance on aphorisms puns quips probes and oddly juxtaposed observations also employ this mosaic technique
innis 's theories of political economy media and society remain highly relevant he had a profound influence on critical media theory and communications and in conjunction with mcluhan offered groundbreaking canadian perspectives on the function of communication technologies as key agents in social and historical change
together their works advanced a theory of history in which communication is central to social change and transformation
the twelfth named storm and fifth hurricane of the <year> atlantic hurricane season it formed in the southwestern gulf of mexico from a tropical wave
after meandering for two days without development the storm began a steady westward track as its structure became better organized
in an <num> ‑ hour period lorenzo 's winds increased from <num> mph <num> km h to <num> mph <num> km h or from a tropical depression to a hurricane
on september <num> it struck near tecolutla veracruz a month after hurricane dean affected the same area before it quickly dissipated over land
the most significantly affected area was veracruz where damage reached over <num> billion pesos <num> million <year> usd
most of it came from road damage in the state 's northern portion although there were also hundreds of damaged houses
between veracruz and neighboring hidalgo there were <num> @,@ <num> people affected across <num> municipalities
overall there were six deaths in the country one in veracruz and five in puebla
in the latter state a family of three perished in a landslide
after moving across the tropical atlantic ocean it traversed much of the caribbean sea before developing an area of thunderstorms on september <num>
the system developed a low pressure area on september <num> after the northern portion of the wave broke off and crossed the yucatán peninsula
initially a hurricane hunters flight was scheduled to investigate the system although the low became disorganized over the southeastern gulf of mexico due to high wind shear
however the wind shear decreased and late on september <num> another hurricane hunters flight indicated the development of a closed low @-@ level circulation
based on that observation along with sufficient persistence of the thunderstorms the system developed into tropical depression thirteen about <num> mi <num> km east of tampico tamaulipas
upon developing the depression was located in an area of weak steering currents resulting in an erratic movement generally to the south
in its formative stages the depression executed a small loop
as it did so it moved into an area of very warm waters and decreasing wind shear
the depression 's convection gradually organized although the winds were slower to increase
an anticyclone became established over the system and the depression intensified into tropical storm lorenzo at around <num> utc on september <num>
at the time it was located about <num> mi <num> km east of tuxpan veracruz moving steadily westward under the influence of a building ridge to its east
as it approached the coast lorenzo rapidly intensified unexpectedly and within <num> hours of attaining tropical storm status it strengthened into a hurricane
hurricane lorenzo quickly developed a closed eyewall which was observed on radar and provided a peak intensity estimate of <num> mph <num> km h at <num> utc on september <num>
the cyclone maintained vigorous and symmetric convection across the center although the structure deteriorated slightly before lorenzo crossed the coast near tecolutla veracruz at <num> utc that day with winds estimated around <num> mph <num> km h
after making landfall the hurricane rapidly weakened to tropical depression intensity
progressing inland the circulation became difficult to locate as the convection diminished to rainbands along the coast
within <num> hours after moving ashore the circulation of lorenzo dissipated therefore ending its duration as a tropical cyclone
about <num> hours before landfall a tropical storm warning was put into place from palma sola to cabo rojo which in turn was upgraded to a hurricane warning six hours later
mexico 's civilian protection officials declared a red alert for much of the state of veracruz
along the coast of veracruz officials canceled school classes
officials opened <num> shelters in veracruz along with six in neighboring hidalgo which housed <num> @,@ <num> people during the storm
the government of veracruz provided buses for people to transport from their houses to the shelters
ports in tecolutla tuxpan and nautla were forced to close
lorenzo 's formation caused gas prices to rise due to its potential to disrupt oil facilities in the gulf of mexico
hurricane lorenzo made landfall in veracruz the same region of east @-@ central mexico as hurricane dean did one month prior
the hurricane primarily affected small fishing villages along the coast where strong winds knocked down power lines leaving about <num> @,@ <num> people without electricity
to prevent the danger of fallen wires officials shut off the power grid in several municipalities in northern veracruz
the winds also destroyed the roofs of several houses in nautla
in addition to the high winds lorenzo dropped heavy rainfall along the coast and further inland peaking at <num>
<num> in <num> mm in el raudal veracruz
the rains caused flash flooding and mudslides that killed at least four people including a family of three in puebla state
landslides also closed portions of three highways
in some locations floodwaters reached about <num> foot <num> mm in depth
the combination of winds and rains damaged <num> houses in puebla while in hidalgo the san lorenzo river overflowed its banks and forced the evacuation of over <num> people
overflown rivers in veracruz forced about <num> @,@ <num> people to leave their houses
along the cazones river more than <num> @,@ <num> houses were flooded resulting in local police officials to assist in evacuations
damage in veracruz was estimated at <num> billion pesos <num> million <year> usd much of it from road damage in the northern portion of the state
overall the hurricane affected <num> @,@ <num> people across veracruz and hidalgo prompting the declaration of a state of emergency in <num> municipalities
the declaration allowed the usage of emergency resources for the affected people
there were a total of six deaths in the country five of which in puebla
by about three days after the storm all schools were reopened
the mexican government distributed food water and construction materials for the areas most affected in veracruz
following the storm about <num> power workers were dispatched in veracruz to restore electricity in the affected areas

stromeyer found the new element as an impurity in zinc carbonate calamine and for <num> years germany remained the only important producer of the metal
the metal was named after the latin word for calamine because it was found in this zinc compound
stromeyer noted that some impure samples of calamine changed color when heated but pure calamine did not
he was persistent in studying these results and eventually isolated cadmium metal by roasting and reducing the sulfide
the potential for cadmium yellow as pigment was recognized in the <num> but the lack of cadmium limited this application

no significant deposits of cadmium @-@ containing ores are known
greenockite cds the only cadmium mineral of importance is nearly always associated with sphalerite zns
this association is caused by geochemical similarity between zinc and cadmium with no geological process likely to separate them
thus cadmium is produced mainly as a byproduct from mining smelting and refining sulfidic ores of zinc and to a lesser degree lead and copper
small amounts of cadmium about <num> of consumption are produced from secondary sources mainly from dust generated by recycling iron and steel scrap

the most dangerous form of occupational exposure to cadmium is inhalation of fine dust and fumes or ingestion of highly soluble cadmium compounds
inhalation of cadmium fumes can result initially in metal fume fever but may progress to chemical pneumonitis pulmonary edema and death
cadmium is also an environmental hazard
human exposure is primarily from fossil fuel combustion phosphate fertilizers natural sources iron and steel production cement production and related activities nonferrous metals production and municipal solid waste incineration
bread root crops and vegetables also contribute to the cadmium in modern populations
there have been a few instances of general population poisoning as the result of long @-@ term exposure to cadmium in contaminated food and water and research into an estrogen mimicry that may induce breast cancer is ongoing
in the decades leading up to world war ii mining operations contaminated the jinzū river in japan with cadmium and traces of other toxic metals
as a consequence cadmium accumulated in the rice crops along the riverbanks downstream of the mines
some members of the local agricultural communities consumed the contaminated rice and developed itai @-@ itai disease and renal abnormalities including proteinuria and glucosuria
the victims of this poisoning were almost exclusively post @-@ menopausal women with low iron and other mineral body stores
similar general population cadmium exposures in other parts of the world have not resulted in the same health problems because the populations maintained sufficient iron and other mineral levels
thus although cadmium is a major factor in the itai @-@ itai disease in japan most researchers have concluded that it was one of several factors
cadmium is one of six substances banned by the european union 's restriction on hazardous substances rohs directive which regulates hazardous substances in electrical and electronic equipment but allows for certain exemptions and exclusions from the scope of the law
the international agency for research on cancer has classified cadmium and cadmium compounds as carcinogenic to humans
although occupational exposure to cadmium is linked to lung and prostate cancer there is still a substantial controversy about the carcinogenicity of cadmium in low environmental exposure

the fighting occurred during a limited un offensive by us i corps codenamed operation commando
this offensive ultimately pushed the chinese back from the imjin river to the jamestown line and destroyed elements of four chinese armies following heavy fighting
the much smaller battle at maryang san took place over a five @-@ day period and saw the <num> battalion royal australian regiment <num> rar dislodge a numerically superior chinese force from the tactically important kowang @-@ san hill <num> and maryang san hill <num> features in conjunction with other units of the 1st commonwealth division
using tactics first developed against the japanese in new guinea during the second world war the australians gained the advantage of the high ground and assaulted the chinese positions from unexpected directions
they then repelled repeated chinese counterattacks aimed at re @-@ capturing maryang san with both sides suffering heavy casualties before the australians were finally relieved by a british battalion
however with the peace @-@ talks ongoing these operations proved to be last actions in the war of manoeuvre which had lasted the previous sixteen months
it was replaced by a static war characterised by fixed defences reminiscent of the western front in <year> – <num>

the chinese spring offensive during april and may <year> ended in its defeat while following two months of sporadic operations in mid @-@ june and august the war entered a new phase with van fleet returning to the offensive
in july the kansas and wyoming lines were strengthened while a limited offensive in the east @-@ central sector in mid @-@ august seized the high ground around the punchbowl and bloody ridge during the battle of bloody ridge
in september the offensive in this sector continued targeting the next hill complex north of bloody ridge known as heartbreak ridge
meanwhile the organisation of british commonwealth ground forces fighting in korea as part of the united nations command had undergone considerable change in the months following the battles of the imjin river and kapyong in late @-@ april <year>
<num> rar had been transferred from <num> british infantry brigade to the <num> british commonwealth brigade when that formation departed for hong kong
meanwhile after protracted negotiations between the governments of australia britain canada india new zealand and south africa agreement had been reached to establish an integrated formation with the aim of increasing the political significance of their contribution as well as facilitating the solution of the logistic and operational problems faced by the various commonwealth contingents
the 1st commonwealth division was formed on <num> july <year> with the division including the <num> canadian <num> british commonwealth and <num> british infantry brigades under the command of major general james cassels and was part of us i corps
since its formation the division had occupied part of the west @-@ central sector of the un line approximately <num> kilometres <num> mi north of the capital seoul
the <num> brigade included three infantry battalions — the 1st battalion king 's own scottish borderers <num> kosb 1st battalion king 's shropshire light infantry <num> ksli and the <num> battalion royal australian regiment — under the command of brigadier george taylor
during this period <num> rar was commanded by lieutenant colonel francis hassett
peace @-@ talks at kaesong during july and september led to a lull in the fighting and <num> rar undertook mainly defensive duties helping to construct the defences of the kansas line south of the imjin river as well as conducting extensive patrolling on the northern side
the battalion also used the reduced operational tempo as an opportunity to train reinforcements
the period culminated in a limited and largely unopposed divisional advance <num> kilometres <num>
<num> mi north of the imjin to the wyoming line codenamed operation minden in september
<num> mi north of the <num> parallel with the aim of pushing chinese forces back and giving united nations forces more leverage at the truce negotiations now occurring at panmunjom
operation commando was scheduled for <num> – <num> october <year> and the us i corps commander lieutenant general john w
o 'daniel envisioned a concept of operations in which three of the corps four divisions would advance on a broad front in conjunction with us <num> infantry division on the left flank of the neighbouring us ix corps seizing a new defensive line known as the jamestown line
the divisions to be used in the advance included the 1st commonwealth division us 1st cavalry division and the <num> south korean division
the 1st south korean division would remain in its existing position on the left flank
in the sector occupied by 1st commonwealth division chinese communist forces were dug into a group of hills overlooking the imjin river
the division faced <num> @,@ <num> troops from the chinese 191st division <num> army under the overall command of xie zhengrong
the chinese forces were divided into three regiments of about <num> @,@ <num> men each with two regiments dug @-@ in in well prepared defensive positions with overhead protection and a third regiment in support
the <num> brigade faced one of the two forward regiments — the 571st regiment — which was deployed with one battalion on hill <num> a second battalion astride hill <num> and hill <num> and a third battalion in reserve to the west
the task allocated to the british commonwealth force was to take these positions with the intention of advancing the line from the southern bank of the imjin to a line of hills to the north in total an objective that stretched more than <num> kilometres <num>
<num> mi
the primary objectives of the advance would be the capture of kowang @-@ san hill <num> and maryang san hill <num> and the task of taking these positions was allocated to the <num> british commonwealth brigade with this formation bearing the brunt of the fighting
cassels planned on capturing the jamestown line in three phases
in the first phase scheduled for <num> october the <num> brigade would take hill <num> in the east @-@ central sector
during the second phase on <num> october the <num> brigade would assault the two hill <num> features and the south @-@ western ridge running to the samichon river
lastly during the third phase scheduled for <num> october the <num> brigade would capture hills <num> and <num>
as such the bulk of the division 's strength would be concentrated on the right flank to be held by the <num> brigade meanwhile the <num> brigade would hold the left flank and the <num> brigade would be held in reserve while providing a battalion to each of the other brigades as reinforcements
kowang @-@ san would be assaulted during the first phase by <num> kosb with <num> ksli and <num> rar in support while maryang san would be taken in the third phase of the operation by <num> rar and the 1st battalion royal northumberland fusiliers <num> rnf who were under commander from <num> brigade for the duration of operation commando
careful reconnaissance and planning took place in the week prior to the commencement of the operation and taylor emphasised the use of indirect fires air support and infiltration tactics to limit casualties as well as the exploitation of weak points in the chinese defences
in direct support of the brigade was <num> field regiment royal new zealand artillery with its <num>
<num> @-@ inch <num> mm <num> @-@ pounder field guns in addition to divisional and corps assets which included <num>

<num> in heavy artillery in total more than <num> guns and mortars
also in support were two british centurion tank squadrons from the <num> royal irish hussars
two previous attempts to take maryang san by american troops had been unsuccessful
regardless utilising tactics first developed against the japanese in new guinea during the second world war of running along the tops of ridges he intended to gain the advantage of the high ground while utilising the cover afforded by the vegetation and the ease of movement along the crest @-@ lines in order to assault the chinese positions from unexpected directions
meanwhile the chinese defenders on maryang san were also testing a newly developed tactic called the mobile positional defense in which only small units were stationed on the hills in order to exhaust the un attackers while the bulk of the chinese defenders would later counterattack before the un forces could consolidate into their newly gained positions
however during the first phase of the operation the australians would be tasked with capturing a chinese outpost on hill <num> to allow tanks and medium machine @-@ guns to provide direct fires onto the northern and eastern slopes of hill <num> in support of an attack by the borderers from the south @-@ east
likewise the shropshires would assault and capture hill <num>
finally then two days before the start of operation commando the <num> brigade crossed the imjin river to assemble behind the <num> brigade on <num> october
the following day the <num> rar less d company and the borderers moved forward carefully into their assembly areas ready to advance the following morning
c company advanced to a position <num> @,@ <num> metres <num> @,@ <num> yd in front of the canadian positions north @-@ east of hill <num>
b company was <num> metres <num> yd to the rear
in the afternoon c company was subjected to heavy shelling losing one soldier wounded
d company — under the command of major basil hardiman — was detached to <num> brigade to strengthen its extended front and it would not be available until the afternoon of <num> october
a company then moved up behind c company
artillery and mortar fire targeted known chinese artillery positions with counter @-@ battery fire prior to dawn before switching to support the borderers in their assault on hill <num>
simultaneously the shropshires were assaulting hill <num> and with the support of a squadron <num> royal irish hussars they reached the positions without opposition by <num> <num>
by <num> <num> b company had gained the high ground to the north and then proceeded to patrol the short distance to west to the objective which was then taken with three wounded five chinese were killed and one captured
by mid @-@ morning both the shropshires and the australians had successfully captured their objectives
expecting a counter @-@ attack the australians on hill <num> began digging @-@ in however no such attack occurred
d company subsequently returned and was allocated a position between c company and the borderers
c and b companies both received shelling during the day wounding two men
at <num> <num> a company — under captain jim shelton — took over the defence of hill <num> and b company went into reserve behind a company
according to plan a troop of centurion tanks and a section of medium machine @-@ guns were then moved up onto hill <num> and began directing their fire onto the northern slopes of hill <num> in support of the borderers
meanwhile at <num> <num> following preparation by artillery and mortar fire the lead british assault companies had begun to advance on hill <num>
however with the chinese expecting an assault from that direction the initial british moves met strong resistance and the borderers were forced to withdraw and reorganise
at <num> <num> a second assault reached the objectives on the lower slopes and these gains were consolidated by nightfall
the attack was now behind schedule
indeed the borderers were still more than <num> @,@ <num> yards <num> m short of their final objective and with stubborn resistance being encountered during the initial phase hill <num> would now not be secured until the afternoon of <num> october
the assault was being slowed by two positions on the northeast slopes of hill <num> — known as hill <num> — from which the chinese held the british right flank in enfilade
c company <num> rar would be detached to assist the attack on kowang @-@ san the next morning with the australians tasked with outflanking the chinese defences and capturing this position
heavy chinese artillery fire had also slowed progress with more than <num> @,@ <num> rounds falling in the <num> brigade area in the previous twenty @-@ four hours although this total was dwarfed many times over by the weight of allied artillery fired across the brigade front which included <num> @,@ <num> rounds
on the division 's left flank the delay also meant that the canadian attack scheduled for <num> <num> the next day in the <num> brigade sector would have to be postponed until <num> <num> due to the continuing requirement to use the divisional artillery in support of <num> brigade
launching their assault at <num> <num> the australians quickly killed or drove off the defenders before pressing on up the spur and routing the remainder of a chinese company
reaching their objectives by <num> <num> the australians then took advantage of the initiative gained so far pushing a platoon towards the summit of hill <num>
amid heavy fighting the australians cleared the eastern slopes of kowang @-@ san by <num> <num> despite having received no orders to do so
thirteen chinese were killed and three captured in the fighting while australian casualties included <num> wounded one of whom subsequently died
gerke was later awarded the distinguished service order dso for his leadership
c company withdrew to the rear of the <num> rar position and were replaced by d company who occupied the position held by a company <num> metres <num> yd north of hill <num>
meanwhile led by a bagpiper the borderers made a simultaneous assault up the western face of kowang @-@ san and fearing they may be caught between two attacks the chinese defenders abandoned hill <num> withdrawing northwest under heavy indirect fire
given the strong resistance exhibited by the chinese the canadians expected a tough fight as <num> brigade prepared to assault its objectives as part of the second phase of the divisional plan
yet with the loss of hill <num> and <num> the chinese unexpectedly withdrew from their well @-@ prepared defensive positions with hill <num> and <num> captured without opposition
only the <num> battalion princess patricia 's canadian light infantry encountered any opposition before they captured the two hill <num> features losing one killed and six wounded during stiff fighting in which <num> chinese were also killed
indeed the ease with which the canadians had captured their initial objectives allowed them to press on attaining their final objectives on the jamestown line by nightfall
no further resistance was encountered although heavy chinese artillery fire caused a number of casualties including three killed
the canadians subsequently occupied the positions they were destined to hold for the next twenty @-@ two months of fighting
meanwhile on the <num> brigade 's left flank the shropshires met slight resistance securing hill <num> southwest of kowang @-@ san by <num> <num>
they were then relieved by the canadians by nightfall in preparation for the third phase of the operation
the brigade plan was now a day behind schedule although with the unexpected ease experienced by the canadians overall the divisional attack was still running according to plan
however determined to hold on following the loss of hill <num> the chinese moved in fresh troops heavily reinforcing a number of positions including maryang san
however following the delay in capturing hill <num> hassett would not be ready to implement his plan until early the next day
as such the third phase would begin on <num> october with the royal northumberland fusiliers scheduled to attack an intermediate objective — hill <num> adjacent kowang @-@ san — before assisting the australians assault hill <num>
the australians moved into position northeast of hill <num> on the afternoon of <num> october while over the night of <num> <num> october the divisional artillery hit chinese positions with two batteries of <num> @-@ inch <num> mm howitzers and another two <num> @-@ millimetre <num>
<num> in batteries supplementing them
air strikes by the mustangs of no
<num> squadron south african air force were also planned targeting chinese concentrations north and west of the objectives to cut @-@ off supplies and reinforcements
both the australians and fusiliers were scheduled to begin their attacks at first light — at <num> <num> — following a heavy artillery preparation
in the dark the fusiliers moved off but amid dense fog they found it difficult to maintain their bearings and were not in position in time to commence the attack as planned
by <num> <num> they had struggled to within <num> metres <num> yd from their objective and following further delays the assault was commenced at <num> <num>
after initially achieving surprise a number of the forward chinese outposts fell to the fusiliers
occupying strong defensive positions on hill <num> the chinese regained the initiative however and poured heavy machine @-@ gun and rifle fire onto the attackers as they crossed the valley forcing them to withdraw after suffering heavy casualties and running low on ammunition
having expected the main axis of assault from the south the chinese positions were stronger than previously considered and the fusiliers were unable to gain the summit despite one company gaining a toehold on the summit by midday
earlier that morning at <num> <num> b and d companies <num> rar had moved north across the valley while anti @-@ tank platoon crossed the imjin taking up positions further north in order to protect the right flank
the assaulting companies would then move west towards a series of objectives before assaulting hill <num>
initially <num> rar was to attack from the east while <num> rnf would attack from the southwest through hill <num> however with the fusiliers facing stiff resistance on hill <num> itself they were unable to get forward to assist
the previous attempts to capture maryang san had failed due to the approach to steep eastern slopes of the feature being across a wide open valley that was dominated by enfilade fire from mutually supporting chinese positions
consequently the australians planned to cross the valley under cover of darkness and position themselves on the chinese flank in the foothills before scaling the position at first light
a company would create a diversion on the left flank while b company would clear the lower slopes before d company passed through to assault the chinese main defensive position known as the victor feature in a one @-@ up one @-@ in @-@ depth assault
however following the casualties of previous nights on hill <num> <num> and <num> and the effect of constant shelling <num> rar was now reduced to just <num> men
in contrast the australians faced two fresh chinese battalions on maryang san in total about <num> @,@ <num> men
b company — commanded by captain henry nicholls — led off shrouded in the heavy mist and with visibility limited in the thick vegetation it drifted to the right off the intended axis of advance having lost direction suffering a similar fate as the fusiliers
disorientated the assaulting companies became separated and the battalion attack turned into a series of independent company attacks
d company slowly continued forward however and when the mist lifted suddenly at <num> <num> they were left dangerously exposed still only halfway up the slope to their objective
the australian approach had surprised the chinese however who were apparently expecting the assault from the north and d company succeeded in closing to within grenade range of the chinese on victor
during a fierce twenty @-@ minute fire @-@ fight the australians cleared their first objective with the assistance of direct fire from supporting tanks and indirect fire support from artillery losing three killed and <num> wounded
included among the australian wounded was the company commander and one of the platoon commanders both of whom remained in command despite gunshot wounds
chinese losses included <num> killed and <num> captured
during the initial phase a company had attacked southwest along a spur leading to hill <num> and had met stiff opposition
the diversion was largely successful however causing the chinese to reinforce against the attack which they believed to be the main effort
meanwhile d company continued to press their attack along the high ground towards the uniform feature assaulting the deeply entrenched chinese positions which included heavy automatic weapons
by <num> <num> it had successfully captured the last of the intermediate objectives assigned to it and a platoon from b company was pushed forward to assist in the clearance of the feature
later lieutenant l
g
clark was awarded the military cross while sergeant w
j
rowlinson was awarded a bar to his distinguished conduct medal for their actions during the fighting
by this time total chinese casualties included <num> killed and <num> captured while the australians believed that a large number of chinese had also been wounded
following the progress of b and d companies c company was moved up behind them and with the capture of final objective they immediately commenced an assault on hill <num> capturing <num> prisoners for no loss
although the chinese had been well dug @-@ in there were no barbed wire obstacles to hamper the attackers and the australians had rapidly gained the position
by <num> <num> maryang san had fallen to the australians with the chinese withdrawing under heavy artillery mortar and machine @-@ gun fire
on hill <num> the fusiliers had maintained the pressure on the chinese throughout the day however they were still unable to capture the feature
regardless the efforts of the fusiliers in conjunction with a company 's diversionary attack and the rapid advance of d company with tank and artillery support had carried the day
a company continued to attack against heavy opposition and indirect fire slowly pushing the chinese defenders back
later a platoon was detached to assist c company consolidate the defence of maryang san following its capture while the remaining two platoons were withdrawn rearwards again under heavy artillery fire
indeed although it had played a supporting role in the attack the efforts of a company had been vital suffering <num> casualties while killing at least <num> chinese and capturing two
now with maryang san captured the australians began digging @-@ in modifying the south @-@ facing linear chinese trench system into an all @-@ round defensive position with mutually supporting weapons pits
fully expecting a chinese counter @-@ attack that evening hasset moved the assault pioneer platoon to bolster the hasty defences
meanwhile the chinese still occupied three key ridgeline positions — the sierra feature the hinge and the summit of hill <num> itself — which they continued to furiously defend
these would be the scene of considerable fighting in the days to come as the australians attempted to clear them
to add further depth to their defences and to probe the chinese positions taylor ordered the australians to capture the central remaining chinese position the sierra feature — a wooded knoll halfway between the summit of maryang san and the hinge — the next day
meanwhile the fusiliers would renew their attack on hill <num>
the southern approach to hill <num> had proved to be too strongly defended by the chinese and it became obvious that if it was to be overcome taylor would need to split the fire of its defenders
to do this the high ground to the north @-@ west of maryang san known as the hinge would be vital
indeed adjacent to hill <num> the hinge dominated it from the north
as such for the next assault planned for the morning the fusiliers would detach their reserve company to attack the hinge from the east using the australian positions on maryang san as a firm base and thereby allowing them to outflank their opponents on hill <num>
at <num> <num> on <num> october <num> platoon c company — under the command of lieutenant arthur pembroke — moved forward to sierra using the heavy mist to conceal their movements
under @-@ strength and not expecting the feature to be occupied instead the australians found a large number of chinese in well prepared defensive positions
without fire support and outnumbered the australians immediately conducted a quick attack and using grenades and bayonets they inflicted heavy casualties on the chinese before forcing the survivors to withdraw
although subjected to constant shelling <num> platoon continued to hold the knoll repelling several counterattacks over the next <num> hours cutting down each assault through the tree @-@ line and long grass with accurate rifle and machine @-@ gun fire forcing the chinese to withdraw leaving their dead and wounded behind
one australian was killed in the initial assault on sierra while a number were later wounded during the defence
chinese casualties included <num> killed <num> wounded and seven captured
pembroke was later awarded the military cross
during the day the fusiliers again assaulted hill <num> from the south and attempted to work their way around the eastern and western flanks of the feature
despite preparation by the divisional artillery and the <num> rar machine gun platoon firing their vickers medium machine @-@ guns in support from maryang san the fusiliers were unable to make progress due to chinese machine @-@ guns located in bunkers at the top of their objective
meanwhile their flanking movements were also blocked by chinese small arms and grenades
<num> rnf had now taken over <num> casualties during two days of fighting and by the afternoon they were a spent force
sensing the fusiliers weakness the chinese then launched their own assault forcing them to withdraw in contact
previous plans for an assault on the hinge had not occurred due to issues with resupply and the dangerous approach march that would have been required
again despite their efforts the fusiliers had failed to capture their objective
it seemed that the only way to finally secure hill <num> was along the ridge from hill <num> via the hinge and as such the australians would be tasked with capturing the hinge the following day
b company was subsequently allocated the attack
in preparation they ascended hill <num> late in the afternoon of <num> october finally securing the crest and at last light joined <num> platoon on the knoll northwest of the summit where they would form up the next day to conduct the assault
in the early hours of <num> october the allied artillery and mortar bombardment began targeting chinese positions on the hinge
hassett moved the <num> rar tactical headquarters on to hill <num> just before the assaulting troops stepped off the line of departure allowing him to direct the battle from a forward position and to co @-@ ordinate fire support
waiting for the fog to lift so that the artillery could fire until the last safe moment the attack finally began at <num> <num>
b company moved off down the ridgeline with two @-@ up and one @-@ in @-@ depth using the trees and long grass for concealment
initially it seemed that the chinese had withdrawn during the night when suddenly the lead australian platoons were engulfed by small arms fire from their rear
a series of intense fire @-@ fights ensued as the australians fought back and by <num> <num> the hinge finally fell with the australians losing two killed and <num> wounded
chinese casualties included more than <num> killed
as a result of the fighting captain henry nicholls and lieutenant jim hughes were awarded the military cross while corporal j
park and corporal e
f
bosworth were awarded the military medal
yet even as the surviving chinese withdrew artillery and mortar fire began to fall on the hinge
b company moved quickly to consolidate the position but were hampered by the shelling while they now faced a pressing shortage of ammunition and difficulties evacuating their casualties
for the remainder of the day b company was subjected to intense indirect fire on the hinge as was c company on hill <num>
the anti @-@ tank platoon and assault pioneer platoon reinforced c company with a platoon of c company moved forward to the hinge to support b company
at <num> <num> both the hinge and hill <num> were again heavily shelled for <num> minutes heralding the beginning of the inevitable chinese counterattack
heavy mist concealed the chinese advance and this assisted many to penetrate the australian perimeter
throughout the night of <num> <num> october the hinge was attacked on three occasions from both the front and the flanks by a force of battalion strength however the australians beat back the chinese in desperate hand @-@ to @-@ hand combat
the chinese swept forward but were stopped by intense small arms and artillery fire
during one such assault sergeant p
j
o 'connell on seeing one of his platoon 's bren gunners wounded manned the light machine @-@ gun himself breaking up a chinese assault while controlling the fire of the men around him
meanwhile sergeant r
w
strong arranged the resupply of ammunition to the forward australian sections
both were awarded the military medal
the intensity of the fighting had led to a severe shortage of ammunition among the defenders and attempts to resupply the australians were plagued by heavy shelling
the use of salvaged ammunition stabilised the situation momentarily after one of b company 's two vickers medium machine @-@ guns was destroyed by chinese shelling and its ammunition belts were subsequently broken up and dispersed among the riflemen
however this soon resulted in a large number of mechanical failures and weapon stoppages causing additional problems for the defenders
the evacuation of casualties was again an issue and the assault pioneer platoon — commanded by lieutenant jock mccormick — was used as stretcher bearers and to run ammunition forward as were a number of the other specialist platoons
their ammunition nearly exhausted the australians resorted to kicking and strangling many of the attacking chinese during the brutal fighting
fearing the australians would be overwhelmed by the persistent chinese attacks taylor ordered the borderers and shropshires to detach their korean porters to resupply the australians while a full divisional concentration of artillery was fired in support of <num> rar
ultimately b company succeeded in holding their hastily constructed defensive positions throughout the night and until <num> <num> on <num> october when the chinese finally gave up
in order to preserve its remaining strength the chinese 191st division was forced to pull back by <num> kilometres <num>
<num> mi surrendering the control of hill <num> without a fight
at first light more than <num> chinese dead and wounded lay around the australian defences and in contrast to the savage fighting during the night chinese stretcher parties were allowed to come forward and collect their wounded under a flag of truce
the australians had been victorious but were now exhausted after five days of heavy fighting
chinese casualties on hill <num> had been severe with at least <num> killed determined by body count and another <num> captured while hundreds more were thought likely to have been killed and wounded
later it was estimated that the australians had destroyed at least two chinese battalions during the five @-@ day battle
<num> rnf once more advanced against hill <num> this time without opposition sending patrols to confirm that the chinese had withdrawn
they were met by patrols from <num> kosb on the hinge with the borderers taking control of the area at <num> <num>
hill <num> was latter occupied on <num> october by the borderers
the <num> rar assault pioneer platoon the anti @-@ tank platoon and a platoon from c company remained on maryang san however and during the evening of <num> <num> october the pioneers killed four chinese during a probe on their position
they were finally relieved on <num> october
for his leadership hassett was immediately awarded the dso while a number of awards were also made to others that had distinguished themselves during the fighting
the royal australian regiment was subsequently granted the battle honours kowang @-@ san and maryang san
today the first battle of maryang san is widely regarded as one of the australian army 's greatest accomplishments of the korean war
despite difficulties an adequate flow of ammunition equipment food and water was maintained although there were occasions when the australians endured thirst and hunger for several hours
<num> rar used <num> @,@ <num> rounds of small arms <num> @,@ <num> grenades and <num> @,@ <num> mortar rounds during the five @-@ day battle all of which was moved in man @-@ packable loads by korean service corps porters and australian soldiers over long distances and extreme terrain often while under fire
these resupply operations had required considerable effort and bravery to effect and a number of korean porters were killed and wounded at maryang san
indeed the evacuation of casualties and the resupply of ammunition at times proved problematic and heavy shelling and sniper fire disrupted stretcher parties and porters on a number of occasions resulting in the forward companies running short of ammunition
meanwhile the quality of support given to the british and australian infantry by the artillery and tanks was of a high standard and proved a critical factor
indeed the tanks had often operated in terrain to which they were unsuited while the new zealand gunners had fired over <num> @,@ <num> rounds in direct support of <num> rar blistering the paint off the barrels of their guns
air support including that provided by the south african mustangs had been important throughout
the battle was also noted for the pioneering use of tunnel warfare by the chinese in the korean war
during the fighting a company of chinese soldiers had defended their positions from a u @-@ shaped tunnel capable of housing <num> men which had served as both a bomb shelter and a base for counterattacks
the company leader later claimed that the tunnel enabled the defenders to inflict <num> un casualties while suffering only <num> casualties in return
impressed by the report the commander of the people 's volunteer army peng dehuai later ordered the construction of <num> @-@ metre <num> ft deep tunnels along the entire front line and it formed a formidable obstacle for un forces to overcome during the stalemate period
chinese losses were estimated at <num> @,@ <num> casualties while un losses were <num> @,@ <num> — the majority of them in the us 1st cavalry division which had borne the brunt of the fighting
although a few hills south of the line remained in communist hands — requiring a follow @-@ up operation known as operation polecharge which succeeded in capturing these positions by <num> october — un supply lines near seoul were now free from chinese interdiction
with the peace @-@ talks ongoing these operations proved to be last actions in the war of manoeuvre which had lasted the previous sixteen months
it was replaced by a static war characterised by fixed defences trench lines bunkers patrols wiring parties and minefields reminiscent of the western front in <year> – <num>
construction of defensive localities began almost immediately although such operations were confined to the reverse slopes during the day due to artillery and mortar fire which made such operations hazardous
patrolling forward of the jamestown line also began in order to prevent the chinese from gaining control of no mans land
yet even as the war became a contest of positional warfare and attrition growing western political sensitivities ensured that un commanders were increasingly mindful of limiting casualties
total casualties among the 1st commonwealth division during operation commando amounted to <num> killed and <num> wounded the bulk of which had occurred during the fighting for hill <num> and hill <num>
indeed in addition to the heavy casualties suffered by <num> rar <num> rnf had lost <num> killed and <num> wounded
the chinese <num> army later received a commendation for keeping their casualties light despite some estimates placing its casualties at higher than <num> @,@ <num>
throughout the operation <num> rar had played a crucial role and in a bold series of holding and flanking movements coordinated with accurate and sustained artillery and direct tank fire it had driven the chinese from both kowang @-@ san and maryang san
they had then held the key position against several unsuccessful counterattacks before forcing the chinese to retire
a month later maryang san was subsequently retaken by the chinese from the borderers amid fierce fighting at the second battle of maryang san for which private bill speakman was later awarded the victoria cross
it was not re @-@ gained and remained in chinese hands until the end of the war
an oft @-@ quoted poem it is popularly used to illustrate the dramatic monologue form
facing old age mythical hero ulysses describes his discontent and restlessness upon returning to his kingdom ithaca after his far @-@ ranging travels
despite his reunion with his wife penelope and son telemachus ulysses yearns to explore again
the character of ulysses in greek odysseus has been explored widely in literature
the adventures of odysseus were first recorded in homer 's iliad and odyssey c
<num> – <num> bc and tennyson draws on homer 's narrative in the poem
most critics however find that tennyson 's ulysses recalls dante 's ulisse in his inferno c
<num>
in dante 's re @-@ telling ulisse is condemned to hell among the false counsellors both for his pursuit of knowledge beyond human bounds and for his adventures in disregard of his family
for much of this poem 's history readers viewed ulysses as resolute and heroic admiring him for his determination to strive to seek to find and not to yield
the view that tennyson intended a heroic character is supported by his statements about the poem and by the events in his life — the death of his closest friend — that prompted him to write it
in the twentieth century some new interpretations of ulysses highlighted potential ironies in the poem
they argued for example that ulysses wishes to selfishly abandon his kingdom and family and they questioned more positive assessments of ulysses character by demonstrating how he resembles flawed protagonists in earlier literature
confronted again by domestic life ulysses expresses his lack of contentment including his indifference toward the savage race line <num> whom he governs
ulysses contrasts his present restlessness with his heroic past and contemplates his old age and eventual death — life piled on life were all too little and of one to me little remains <num> – <num> — and longs for further experience and knowledge
his son telemachus will inherit the throne that ulysses finds burdensome
while ulysses thinks that telemachus will be a good king — most blameless is he centred in the sphere of common duties <num> — he seems to have lost any connection to his son — he works his work i mine <num> — and the conventional methods of governing — by slow prudence and through soft degrees <num> <num>
there is often a marked contrast between the sentiment of ulysses words and the sounds that express them
for example the poem 's insistent iambic pentameter is often interrupted by spondees metrical feet that consist of two long syllables such laboured language slows the poem and in other places may cast doubt upon the reliability of ulysses utterances observing their burdensome prosodic effect the poet matthew arnold remarked these three lines by themselves take up nearly as much time as a whole book of the iliad
many of the poem 's clauses carry over into the following line these enjambments emphasize ulysses restlessness and dissatisfaction
scholars disagree on how ulysses speech functions in this format it is not necessarily clear to whom ulysses is speaking if anyone and from what location
some see the verse turning from a soliloquy to a public address as ulysses seems to speak to himself in the first movement then to turn to an audience as he introduces his son and then to relocate to the seashore where he addresses his mariners
in this interpretation the comparatively direct and honest language of the first movement is set against the more politically minded tone of the last two movements
for example the second paragraph <num> – <num> about telemachus in which ulysses muses again about domestic life is a revised version of lines <num> – <num> for public consumption a savage race is revised to a rugged people
the ironic interpretations of ulysses may be the result of the modern tendency to consider the narrator of a dramatic monologue as necessarily unreliable
according to critic dwight culler the poem has been a victim of revisionist readings in which the reader expects to reconstruct the truth from a misleading narrator 's accidental revelations
compare the more obvious use of this approach in robert browning 's my last duchess
culler himself views ulysses as a dialectic in which the speaker weighs the virtues of a contemplative and an active approach to life ulysses moves through four emotional stages that are self @-@ revelatory not ironic beginning with his rejection of the barren life to which he has returned in ithaca he then fondly recalls his heroic past recognizes the validity of telemachus method of governing and with these thoughts plans another journey
unlike many of tennyson 's other important poems ulysses was not revised after its publication
tennyson originally blocked out the poem in four paragraphs broken before lines <num> <num> and <num>
in this structure the first and third paragraphs are thematically parallel but may be read as interior and exterior monologues respectively
however the poem is often printed with the first paragraph break omitted
the two friends had spent much time discussing poetry and philosophy writing verse and travelling in southern france the pyrenees and germany
tennyson considered hallam destined for greatness perhaps as a statesman
when tennyson heard on <num> october <year> of his friend 's death he was living in somersby lincolnshire in cramped quarters with his mother and nine of his ten siblings
his father had died in <year> requiring tennyson to return home and take responsibility for the family
tennyson 's friends were becoming increasingly concerned about his mental and physical health during this time
the family had little income and three of tennyson 's brothers were mentally ill
just as tennyson 's outlook was improving — he was adjusting to his new domestic duties regaining contact with friends and had published his <year> book of poems — the news of hallam 's death arrived
tennyson shared his grief with his sister emily who had been engaged to hallam
according to victorian scholar linda hughes the emotional gulf between the state of his domestic affairs and the loss of his special friendship informs the reading of ulysses — particularly its treatment of domesticity
at one moment ulysses discontent seems to mirror that of tennyson who would have been frustrated with managing the house in such a state of grief
at the next ulysses is determined to transcend his age and his environment by travelling again
it may be that ulysses determination to defy circumstance attracted tennyson to the myth he said that the poem gave my feeling about the need of going forward and braving the struggle of life
on another occasion the poet stated there is more about myself in ulysses which was written under the sense of loss and that all had gone by but that still life must be fought out to the end
it was more written with the feeling of his loss upon me than many poems in in memoriam
hallam 's death influenced much of tennyson 's poetry including perhaps his most highly regarded work in memoriam a
h
h
begun in <year> and completed seventeen years later
other critics find stylistic incongruities between the poem and its author that make ulysses exceptional
w
w
robson writes tennyson the responsible social being the admirably serious and committed individual is uttering strenuous sentiments in the accent of tennyson the most un @-@ strenuous lonely and poignant of poets
he finds that tennyson 's two widely noted personae the responsible social being and the melancholic poet meet uniquely in ulysses yet seem not to recognize each other within the text
the ancient greek poet homer introduced ulysses odysseus in greek and many later poets took up the character including euripides horace dante william shakespeare and alexander pope
homer 's odyssey provides the poem 's narrative background in its eleventh book the prophet tiresias foretells that ulysses will return to ithaca after a difficult voyage then begin a new mysterious voyage and later die a peaceful unwarlike death that comes vaguely from the sea
at the conclusion of tennyson 's poem his ulysses is contemplating undertaking this new voyage
tennyson 's character however is not the lover of public affairs seen in homer 's poems
rather ulisse from dante 's inferno is tennyson 's main source for the character which has an important effect on the poem 's interpretation
ulisse recalls his voyage in the inferno 's <num> canto in which he is condemned to the eighth circle of false counsellors for misusing his gift of reason
dante treats ulisse with his zeal … t 'explore the world as an evil counsellor who lusts for adventure at the expense of his family and his duties in ithaca
tennyson projects this zeal into ulysses unquenched desire for knowledge the poet 's intention to recall the homeric character remains evident in certain passages
i am become a name <num> recalls an episode in the odyssey in which demodocus sings about odysseus adventures in the king 's presence acknowledging his fame
with phrases such as there gloom the dark broad seas <num> and the deep moans round with many voices <num> – <num> tennyson seems to be consciously invoking homer
critics have also noted the influence of shakespeare in two passages
in the early movement the savage race that hoard and sleep and feed and know not me <num> echoes hamlet 's soliloquy what is a man if his chief good and market of his time be but to sleep and feed a beast no more
tennyson 's how dull it is to pause to make an end to rust unburnish ’ d not to shine in use <num> – <num> recalls shakespeare 's ulysses in troilus and cressida c
<year> the last movement of ulysses which is among the most familiar passages in nineteenth @-@ century english @-@ language poetry presents decisive evidence of the influence of dante
ulysses turns his attention from himself and his kingdom and speaks of ports seas and his mariners
the strains of discontent and weakness in old age remain throughout the poem but tennyson finally leaves ulysses to strive to seek to find and not to yield <num> recalling the dantesque damnable desire for knowledge beyond all bounds
the words of dante 's character as he exhorts his men to the journey find parallel in those of tennyson 's ulysses who calls his men to join him on one last voyage
quoting dante 's ulisse however critics note that in the homeric narrative ulysses original mariners are dead
a significant irony therefore develops from ulysses speech to his sailors — come my friends tis not too late to seek a newer world <num> – <num>
since dante 's ulisse has already undertaken this voyage and recounts it in the inferno ulysses entire monologue can be envisioned as his recollection while situated in hell
critics who find that tennyson identifies with the speaker read ulysses speech affirmatively or without irony
many other interpretations of the poem have developed from the argument that tennyson does not identify with ulysses and further criticism has suggested that the purported inconsistencies in ulysses character are the fault of the poet himself
key to the affirmative reading of ulysses is the biographical context of the poem
such a reading takes into account tennyson 's statements about writing the poem — the need of going forward — and considers that he would not undermine ulysses determination with irony when he needed a similar stalwartness to face life after hallam 's death
ulysses is thus seen as an heroic character whose determination to seek some work of noble note <num> is courageous in the face of a still hearth <num> and old age
the passion and conviction of tennyson 's language — and even his own comments on the poem — signify that the poet as was typical in the victorian age admired courage and persistence
read straightforwardly ulysses promotes the questing spirit of youth even in old age and a refusal to resign and face life passively
until the early twentieth century readers reacted to ulysses sympathetically
the meaning of the poem was increasingly debated as tennyson 's stature rose
after paull f
baum criticized ulysses inconsistencies and tennyson 's conception of the poem in <year> the ironic interpretation became dominant
baum finds in ulysses echoes of lord byron 's flawed heroes who similarly display conflicting emotions self @-@ critical introspection and a rejection of social responsibility
even ulysses resolute final utterance — to strive to seek to find and not to yield — is undercut by irony when baum and later critics compare this line to satan 's courage never to submit or yield in john milton 's paradise lost <year>
ulysses apparent disdain for those around him is another facet of the ironic perspective
he declares that he is matched with an aged wife <num> indicates his weariness in governing a savage race <num> and suggests his philosophical distance from his son telemachus
a skeptical reading of the second paragraph finds it a condescending tribute to telemachus and a rejection of his slow prudence <num>
however the adjectives used to describe telemachus — blameless discerning and decent — are words with positive connotations in other of tennyson 's poetry and within the classical tradition where blameless is an attribute of gods and heroes
critic e
j
chiasson argued in <year> that ulysses is without faith in an afterlife and that tennyson uses a method of indirection to affirm the need for religious faith by showing how ulysses lack of faith leads to his neglect of kingdom and family
chiasson regards the poem as intractable in tennyson 's canon but finds that the poem 's meaning resolves itself when this indirection is understood it illustrates tennyson 's conviction that disregarding religious sanctions and submitting all things to desire leads to either a sybaritic or a brutal repudiation of responsibility and life
other ironic readings have found ulysses longing for withdrawal even death in the form of his proposed quest
in noting the sense of passivity in the poem critics highlight tennyson 's tendency toward the melancholic

eliot opines that tennyson could not tell a story at all
he finds dante 's treatment of ulysses exciting while tennyson 's piece is an elegiac mood
ulysses is found lacking in narrative action the hero 's goal is vague and by the poem 's famous last line it is not clear for what he is striving or to what he refuses to yield
according to victorian scholar herbert tucker tennyson 's characters move through time and space to be moved inwardly
author john sterling — like tennyson a member of the cambridge apostles — wrote in the quarterly review in <year> how superior is ulysses there is in this work a delightful epic tone and a clear impassioned wisdom quietly carving its sage words and graceful figures on pale but lasting marble
tennyson 's <year> volume of poetry impressed scottish writer thomas carlyle
quoting three lines of ulysses in an <year> letter to tennyson — — carlyle remarked these lines do not make me weep but there is in me what would fill whole lachrymatories as i read
english theologian richard holt hutton summarized the poem as tennyson 's friendly picture of the insatiable craving for new experience enterprise and adventure when under the control of a luminous reason and a self @-@ controlled will
the contemporary poet matthew arnold was early in observing the narrative irony of the poem he found ulysses speech the least plain the most un @-@ homeric which can possibly be conceived
homer presents his thought to you just as it wells from the source of his mind mr
tennyson carefully distils his thought before he will part with it
hence comes
a heightened and elaborate air
despite the critical acclaim ulysses received its rise within the tennyson canon took decades
tennyson did not usually select it for publication in poetry anthologies in teaching anthologies however the poem was usually included — and it remains a popular teaching poem today
its current prominence in tennyson 's oeuvre is the result of two trends according to tennyson scholar matthew rowlinson the rise of formal english poetry studies in the late nineteenth century and the victorian effort to articulate a british culture that could be exported
he argues that ulysses forms part of the prehistory of imperialism — a term that only appeared in the language in <year>
the protagonist sounds like a colonial administrator and his reference to seeking a newer world <num> echoes the phrase new world which became common during the renaissance
while ulysses cannot be read as overtly imperialistic tennyson 's later work as poet laureate sometimes argues for the value of britain 's colonies or was accused of jingoism
rowlinson invokes the marxist theorist louis althusser 's extension of the argument that ideology is ahistorical finding that tennyson 's poem comes before an ideological construction for which it nonetheless makes people nostalgic
s
eliot called ulysses a perfect poem
an analogue of ulysses is found in eliot 's gerontion <year>
both poems are narrated by an aged man contemplating life 's end
an excerpt from gerontion reads as an ironic comment on the introductory lines of ulysses the italian poet giovanni pascoli <year> – <year> stated that his long lyric poem l 'ultimo viaggio was an attempt to reconcile the portrayals of ulysses in dante and tennyson with tiresias 's prophecy that ulysses would die a mild death off the sea
pascoli 's ulysses leaves ithaca to retrace his epic voyage rather than begin another
ulysses remains much admired even as the twentieth century brought new interpretations of the poem
professor of literature basil willey commented in <year> in ulysses the sense that he must press on and not moulder in idleness is expressed objectively through the classical story and not subjectively as his own experience
tennyson comes here as near perfection in the grand manner as he ever did the poem is flawless in tone from beginning to end spare grave free from excessive decoration and full of firmly controlled feeling
in the fifteenth edition of bartlett 's familiar quotations <year> nine sections of ulysses comprising <num> of the poem 's <num> lines are quoted compared to only six in the ninth edition <year>
many readers have accepted the acclaimed last lines of ulysses as inspirational
the poem 's ending line has also been used as a motto by schools and other organisations

the release features ten of yankovic 's song parodies all of which pertain to food
a similar album the tv album which features songs entirely about television would be released two years later
the album was begrudgingly released by yankovic who felt that the compilation was unnecessary and merely a way for his record label to make money
several food @-@ related songs that yankovic had recorded such as girls just want to have lunch and waffle king were left off the record although the former was due to personal preference while the latter was due to scheduling issues
the food album received mixed reviews from music critics many of whom felt that the record was an enjoyable collection of songs but that it was not an essential record to purchase
despite the lukewarm reception the record was certified gold by the recording industry association of america riaa making it yankovic 's first and only compilation record to reach this certification

spam first was released on the soundtrack to the <year> film uhf
the final two songs — the white stuff and taco grande — were taken from the <year> album off the deep end
notable for its absence is girls just want to have lunch from dare to be stupid <year> yankovic 's only previously released food @-@ related song not to make the album
according to yankovic this is due to the fact there is a royalty ceiling on the albums and he needed to pick one song to cut from the list in order to turn a profit on the album
girls just want to have lunch was chosen due to yankovic 's personal dislike of the song as his record label had forced him to record it in order to release dare to be stupid back in <year>
also absent from the release is waffle king
the song had originally been recorded for off the deep end
however yankovic decided to swap waffle king with i was only kidding — a song he had actually recorded for his next album — at the last minute this forced yankovic to shelve waffle king for the time being
the song was later released on smells like nirvana single as well as yankovic 's eighth studio album alapalooza which was released four months after the food album
at the time scotti brothers had insisted on putting out a new album by yankovic in order to meet monetary projections for the fiscal quarter despite the fact that no new album was ready alapalooza would not be released until later in the year
the original concept was to release a record entitled al unplugged which would have featured a cover depicting yankovic holding the cords for unplugged kitchen appliances but instead of being a live album featuring live performances it would have featured studio remixes of previously released material with the electronic instruments missing
yankovic convinced them to release the food album instead — a concept he hated only slightly less — but would later describe it as a cheesy compilation put out against his better wishes and judgement
the tv album was released under similar circumstances in <year> however when it came time to release the latter album yankovic reported that the record company was a whole lot nicer when they asked the second time and that there was more groveling and less demanding
following the release of the food album and the tv album — in addition to the various greatest hits records that had been released — scotti brothers used @-@ up all of their compilation options in yankovic 's contract which prevented the release of further compilations when volcano records acquired his contract in the late <num>

he concluded that the album was like reading mad magazine he gave the record three stars out of five

located on top of the fortified tsarevets hill in the former capital of the second bulgarian empire the cathedral was the seat of the bulgarian patriarch from its construction in the <num> – <num> century to its destruction in <num>
standing on top of a late roman church the cathedral reconstructed in the <num> and <num> follows a cross @-@ domed plan with a bell tower and a triple apse
richly decorated on both the exterior and interior its internal walls now feature modern frescoes the presence of which has meant that it has not been reconsecrated
though not active as a christian place of worship it has been open for visitors since <year>
it was constructed directly on top of a late roman early byzantine basilica which dates to the <num> – <num> century ad
the roman basilica may have remained in use by the local congregation during the first bulgarian empire though it was no longer active by the time the construction of the current church began
the current building of the patriarchal cathedral is considered by scholars to have been built in two stages
the first stage of construction was carried out in the late <num> century or the <num> century
the cathedral was initially built as a monastery church in the middle of a monastery compound though in the early <num> century it was already the seat of the bulgarian patriarch
the compound suffered large @-@ scale damage caused by a fire which necessitated the church 's reconstruction in middle of the <num> century perhaps during the rule of tsar ivan alexander of bulgaria r
<num> – <num>
besides repair and reinforcement efforts work on the church in the <num> century also included the construction of the exonarthex and the bell tower
there are several references to the cathedral in medieval sources
the earliest reference to the church tells of the transfer of saint michael the warrior 's relics from the potuka fortress to the patriarchal cathedral on the order of tsar kaloyan r
<num> – <num>
the housing of a warrior saint 's relics in the patriarchal cathedral signifies the incessant warfare against byzantines and latins that dominated kaloyan 's reign
in the late <num> century the last patriarch of tarnovo saint evtimiy described the church as the great patriarch 's cathedral of the holy ascension in his writings
another possible reference to the church may be in a marginal note from <num> to a copy of the acts of the apostles
in the note the copyist one laloe thanks god and the holy and most glorious ascension for having finished his work on the book
scholar bistra nikolova believes this to be an allusion to the patriarchal cathedral which may have patronised the project
alternatively the copy could have been made at the cathedral 's scriptorium where laloe may have worked
the church is also depicted in the medieval sketch of tarnovo in the braşov menaion a menaion service book written in the mid @-@ <num> century and then carried to kronstadt now braşov romania after the fall of bulgaria under ottoman rule
the patriarchal cathedral was destroyed after the ottomans captured the bulgarian capital after their siege of tarnovo on <num> july <num>
the church was fully reconstructed in the <num> century reconstruction works were carried out by a team under architect boyan kuzupov
these commenced in <year> and were finished in <year> to mark bulgaria 's <num> anniversary
however it was not until november <year> when the contemporary murals were finished that the church was opened once again for visitors
the church 's ruins have been protected as a national antiquity since <year> in <year> they were proclaimed an architectural monument of culture of national importance
as part of the tsarevets architectural reserve it is also listed among the <num> tourist sites of bulgaria
the church was part of a group of buildings which constituted the seat of the bulgarian patriarchate and acted as the city and the country 's main cathedral
the patriarchate on tsarevets was a fortress of its own with two defensive towers and an entrance on its west wall
the patriarchal cathedral stood in the middle of its courtyard
the patriarchal cathedral features a triple apse the central part of which matches the apse of the original basilica on the site
the three @-@ naved church follows the traditional byzantine cross @-@ in @-@ square design
built out of crushed stones and mortar with limited brickwork it measures <num> by <num> metres <num> ft × <num> ft
the cathedral includes two narthices a bell tower and two other premises attached to the south church wall
the presence of a bell tower is considered to be a rarity in balkan church architecture
six columns support the interior and distinguish the altar from the cella naos
it is unclear whether the church housed a synthronon stone benches for the clergy in the apse as there are doubts that its remains may actually be part of the older basilica
the church featured ample exterior and interior decoration
while the facades were decorated with arches and ceramic tiles the interior floor mosaics were made of white yellow and pink marble as well as semi @-@ precious gemstones like sapphire and porphyry
the interior walls were covered with frescoes and mosaics
however none of the interior decoration has survived
during the church 's <num> @-@ century reconstruction its interior was repainted by artist teofan sokerov who depicted important moments of medieval bulgarian history in a modernist style
due to these murals the church has never been reconsecrated and remains inactive
the facade of the cathedral also includes a stone with a donor 's inscription of a bulgarian ruler which ended up as part of the building material
there are a total of four burial grounds in and around the church two of which are burials for priests
one of the burial grounds is inside the exonarthex where overarched tombs were built in the <num> century
besides michael the warrior 's relics the cathedral also housed the remains of bulgarian patriarchs joachim i macarius and joachim iii
the follow @-@ up to her internationally successful album music box <year> and holiday album merry christmas <year> daydream differed from the two by leaning increasingly towards r b and hip hop
throughout the project carey collaborated with walter afanasieff with whom she wrote and produced most of her two previous albums
with daydream carey took more control over the musical direction as well as the album 's composition
carey said she considered daydream the beginning of her musical and vocal transformation a change that became more apparent in her sixth album butterfly <year>
during the album 's production carey endured many creative differences with her label and husband tommy mottola
on daydream carey collaborated with jermaine dupri for the first time and co @-@ wrote and produced a song with kenneth babyface edmonds with whom she had collaborated on music box
it was also the first time she had worked with boyz ii men an r b group consisting of four male vocalists
together they wrote the concept and lyrics for one sweet day a song that carey co @-@ produced with afanasieff
with his assistance and the addition of a few contemporary producers she was able to make a subtle transition into the r b market
daydream was nominated for six grammy awards at the <num> annual ceremony during which carey performed live
due to the album 's critical and commercial success critics believed carey would be one of the night 's big winners
however to her dismay she was completely shut out causing the subject to become very public and controversial
she left the annual ceremony empty @-@ handed
six singles were released from the album
its lead single fantasy became the first single by a female artist to debut at number one on the us billboard hot <num> and went on to top the chart for eight weeks and became the second best @-@ selling single of <year> in the country
the song topped the charts in australia canada and new zealand and became a top @-@ five hit in finland france and the united kingdom
the second single one sweet day topped the billboard hot <num> for sixteen weeks and became the longest @-@ running number one single in american history a record it still holds
it also topped the charts in canada and new zealand and peaked within the top five in australia france ireland and the netherlands
jointly the singles from daydream spent a combined six months at the top of the hot <num>
to promote daydream carey embarked on the short but successful daydream world tour visiting japan and europe
at the time of its release daydream became carey 's best @-@ reviewed album
critics universally praised her matured lyrics and songwriting as well as her musical direction
the album became an international success debuting at number one in nine different countries and in the top five in almost every major music market
daydream became carey 's second album to be certified diamond by the recording industry association of america riaa denoting shipments of ten million copies in the united states
aside from its success in the united states the album made the top five of the best @-@ selling albums in japan by a non @-@ asian artist with <num>
<num> million copies sold
daydream remains one of the best @-@ selling albums of all time with <num> million copies sold worldwide
during the album 's recording carey grew as an artist as well as a writer
for the first time in her career carey was able to make music that she truly related to r b and hip hop
while columbia allowed carey more leniency with the music she recorded they became hesitant when she featured ol dirty in the remix for fantasy
they feared the sudden change was completely left field for her music and worried it would jeopardize the album 's success
in an interview with entertainment weekly carey openly spoke of her issues with columbia everybody was like what are you crazy they 're nervous about breaking the formula
it works to have me sing a ballad on stage in a long dress with my hair up
while carey 's new musical direction caused tension between her and columbia it began to severely strain her relationship with her husband at the time tommy mottola
mottola had always been involved in carey 's career because he was the head of sony music the parent company of her label
since the time of carey 's debut mottola had controlled nearly every aspect of her career keeping her sound carefully regulated and insisting that she continue recording middle @-@ of @-@ the @-@ road pop music despite her interest in hip hop
carey confessed that she never tried to change the situation because she used to be insecure and cautious and so she would listen to what the people said
however the control mottola exerted over her career soon spilled into her personal life once they were married increasing the amount of conflict between the two
soon it was obvious that their marriage was in shambles as stated in a vanity fair article the couple began to argue at the drop of a hat
carey was very involved in the project more so than she had ever been on an album
i went into this phase of recording recording recording and doing it really fast she told time
this time i had more time and i focused more on what i wanted to do
as carey 's career and work continued to reflect her views on how it should sound her marriage to mottola continued to deteriorate
while carey began developing new ideas for daydream she thought of the song genius of love by tom tom club
she had always been a fan of the song and presented dave hall with the idea of sampling the song 's hook
hall incorporated a groove that he felt complimented carey 's voice while she composed some of the other beats and wrote the lyrics
carey recorded a remix to the song as well featuring hip @-@ hop verses from o
d
b of the wu @-@ tang clan as well as production from puffy
she spoke highly of the remix complimenting puffy and o
d
b he 's so known in the street and he 's one of the best people out there
we kind of did what we both do and having o
d
b took it to another level
he was my ultimate choice so i was really happy with the way it turned out
one sweet day was a song that carey wrote with the r b group boyz ii men
after carey 's friend and past collaborator david cole died she began writing and developing a song that would pay homage to him and all the friends and family her fans had lost along life 's journey
carey had the chorus and concept composed and after meeting with boyz ii men they realized they too had a similar idea in development
together using carey 's chorus and idea as well as the melody they had produced they wrote and composed the song
it was produced by afanasieff who built on the song 's melody and added various grooves and beats
carey expressed how the song was meant to be and how all the pieces fit into place i wrote the initial idea for one sweet day with walter and i had the chorus
and i stopped and said i really wanna do this with boyz ii men because
obviously i 'm a big fan of theirs and i just thought that the work was crying out for them the vocals that they do so i put it away and said who knows if this could ever happen but i just don 't wanna finish this song because i want it to be our song if we ever do it together
the whole idea of when you lose people that are close to you it changes your life and changes your perspective
when they came into the studio i played them the idea for the song and when it finished they looked at each other a bit stunned and told me that nat nathan morris had written a song for his road manager who had passed away
it had basically the same lyrics and fit over the same chord changes
it was really really weird we finished the song right then and there
we were all kinda flipped about it ourselves
fate had a lot to do with that
i know some people won 't believe it but we wouldn 't make up such a crazy story
while the album 's development was underway carey expressed interest in working with jermaine dupri whom she had been a fan of since his <year> song jump
soon after carey dupri and manuel seal began composing a song for the album
as seal played the piano carey began humming and playing with certain notes in the b @-@ section until she came up with the chorus for always be my baby
after the rest of the song was written and composed carey recorded the song alongside longtime background singers kelly price shanrae price and melonie daniels
together they built a wall of background voices in which she would cover with her final belting notes
the song featured a downbeat rhythm while its composition was described as sassy and soft r b which displayed a sexy and slow jam
underneath the stars was the first song recorded for daydream
the song featured a <num> soul vibe as well as synthetic record scratches in order to the give the song an authentic <num> sound
carey felt the additions were simple steps taken to further display a contemporary r b groove
additionally she felt the song paid homage to the style of minnie riperton who was one of carey 's biggest vocal influences growing up
the song had a soft sound and had a lot sic of texture and bass showing a more creative side to carey
for the album carey covered the <year> journey song open arms
the song was of carey 's personal choice as well as her own idea
together with afanasieff they toned down the song 's arrangement making it a bit glossy especially in comparison to the raw and powerful one sweet day
additionally with the help of her background singers carey added a touch of gospel to the song
one of the more gospel @-@ influenced songs on the album was i am free
the song was created by carey afanasieff and loris holland with whom she had worked previously on merry christmas
carey began humming the melody with the lyrics she had already written while holland played the organ and afanasieff worked on the song 's programming
giving the song a genuine and unforced gospel feel
the chorus was sophisticated and natural with each following line cascading onto one another something that would have proved difficult for a less skilled vocalist
carey started leaning away from the standard celine dion ballad and more towards r b jams
however she was not going to completely abandon the type of songs that made her famous
for this reason carey wrote when i saw you with afanasieff a song that would truly embody some of her earlier work as well as show off her powerful vocals
returning to her r b territory carey recorded long ago the second song she wrote alongside dupri and seal which contains a strong hip hop background
her vocals in the song were described as sliding over the insistent bassline like silk
melt away was a song carey produced on her own and co @-@ wrote with babyface
the song 's writing and production were superb
with each verse gliding into its chorus
according to chris nickson underneath the stars was as strong as any slow jam released in the nineties and one that would find a lot of flavor late at night with dancers
another song that brought back reminders of older decades was forever
the throwback was featured through the chord changes and in the way the guitar arpeggios stayed at the forefront of the music
the song displayed subtle vocals from carey as well as an undeniable richness
daydream interlude sweet fantasy dub mix was one of the liveliest tracks on the album
the song was a club remix of fantasy which was tuned and remixed by famed house music producer david morales
the song was directed to be a dance @-@ club song further broadening carey 's musical horizon
the song incorporated carey 's vocals and added them to a thumping house beat something he would do for many of her future singles
looking in was the final song on the album
it was carey 's most personal song at the time one in which she let herself appear naked and stripped down it was written by her and afanasieff
according to author chris nickson the song reflected on her life now the changes she 'd gone through and the difference between the public perception of mariah carey and the real person
intimate and revealing it made an appropriate end to the album and was evident that mariah was growing changing and becoming much more herself confident of who she was and what she could do
reviews applauded the little changes of style from previous carey releases some of whom adding that it is her best record while others dismissed it as soulless and lacking of originality
allmusic 's senior editor stephen thomas erlewine awarded the album four and a half out of five stars
erlewine called daydream her best record yet and wrote mariah carey certainly knows how to construct an album
positioning herself directly between urban r b with tracks like fantasy and the adult contemporary radio format with songs like one sweet day a duet with boyz ii men carey appeals to both audiences equally because of the sheer amount of craft and hard work she puts into her albums
daydream is her best record to date featuring a consistently strong selection of songs and a remarkably impassioned performance by carey
daydream demonstrates that carey continues to perfect her craft and that she has earned her status as an r b pop diva
in his review for the album ken tucker from entertainment weekly called daydream her best record since her <year> debut writing in fact it 's easily the best collection carey has put out since her self @-@ titled <year> debut the album daydream most resembles in its emphasis on r b grooves
tucker specifically complimented one sweet day always be my baby forever and daydream interlude fantasy sweet dub mix writing one sweet day her collaboration with boyz ii men radiates a breezy sexiness that carey for all the brazen hussiness of her public persona rarely permits herself to reveal in song
i like the relaxed swing of always be my baby and the brisk waltz tempo of forever
however it 's on what many carey fans will probably find the most throwaway cut daydream interlude fantasy sweet dub mix that the singer really defines herself
at her best as she is on this clipped spunky track carey is a disco diva for the <num> a worthy successor to trailblazing women like donna summer and vicki sue robinson r b singers with an affinity for the endless groove
stephen holden editor of the new york times gave the album a positive review
holden wrote the following regarding daydream ms
carey 's songwriting has taken a leap forward becoming more relaxed sexier and less reliant on thudding cliches
holden praised fantasy which he wrote with fantasy ms
carey glides confidently into the territory where gospel @-@ flavored pop @-@ soul meets light hip @-@ hop and recorded some of the most gorgeously spun choral music to be found on a contemporary album
additionally he complimented one sweet day melt away always be my baby and underneath the stars calling them the best on the album
people gave the album a positive review calling it her fourth and best album
additionally people praised the album and its songs writing daydream vaults over its pop predecessors because the material is both funkier and mellower
carey also has better control of her instrument — her voice evincing greater muscularity and agility
she still pours it on a little thick at times when it comes to fervor as on the midtempo melt away which carey co @-@ wrote with babyface
for the most part she buzzes from strength to strength from the bravura belting on one sweet day a duet with boyz ii men to the rich gospel feel of i am free which has a mood so churchy you can almost hear the ladies handheld fans snapping
while the album was positively reviewed by critics carey 's cover of journey 's <year> song open arms was universally panned
stephen thomas erlewine criticized the song calling it second rate
open arms received a negative review from stephen holden as well who called it a sobbing remake
it gained power again in the upcoming weeks of holiday sales where it peaked in the year 's last weeks with <num> @,@ <num> and <num> @,@ <num> units sold at the pinnacle

originally she had not planned to tour due to the long travel times and hassle however after many requests from fans carey agreed to tour
the tour reached japan and select european countries not visiting the united states
this was possibly due to the mixed reception carey 's <year> north american music box tour received three years prior
the shows were all spaced apart giving carey time to rest her vocals it 's very strenuous to sing all my songs back to back but i 'm actually really looking forward to it
many musicians joined carey for the tour including randy jackson who served as the musical director and played the bass dan shea on the keyboards vernon black playing the guitar gigi conway on the drums and percussion and music sequencing by peter michael and gary cirimelli
all of the musicians and background vocalists were under the supervision of walter afanasieff who played the piano and guided the production
before embarking on her world tour in <year> carey performed a sold @-@ out show at madison square garden in <year>
the performance was filmed and released as a dvd titled fantasy mariah carey at madison square garden
it became carey 's fourth video release

the shows became the fastest sellout in the stadium 's history breaking the previous record held by the rolling stones
the shows in japan were a critical and commercial success with critics and fans raving about the show and carey 's vocals
carey 's presence in asia in the <num> was unparalleled to any other international artist
her international success and anticipation was even compared to the beatlemania in the <num>
in an interview with mtv carey spoke of how she felt performing in asia first of all you 're in front of so many people that basically don 't speak your language
it took a little getting used to but i think by the end of the show you know everybody started to kind of relax
for the show carey sang fourteen original songs including many of her biggest hits up until that point as well as many songs from daydream
they included fantasy one sweet day open arms always be my baby forever and underneath the stars as well as hits from her previous studio efforts
carey 's following shows in france germany the netherlands and the united kingdom were all sold @-@ out as well receiving warm critical response
during the span of the tour 's seven short dates carey had already begun working on concepts for her new album butterfly
according to author marc shapiro carey 's european tour was truly a success in many aspects the european tour mirrored the success of her shows in japan
mariah 's appearances overseas were heartening experiences for the singer
the popularity – indeed mania – surrounding her shows in these countries reached massive proportions
the reception the concerts received reflected the fact that mariah 's music cut through race and language barriers and had struck at a universal emotional core with fans
the tour cemented the fact that mariah carey had arrived as the performing centerpiece on the world stage
in addition to touring the world carey performed on a variety of television programs and award shows
after fantasy was released in september throughout europe carey performed the song on the popular british chart show top of the pops which aired live via satellite on asian television
carey performed fantasy in france and at the <num> annual american music awards on january <num> <year>
one sweet day was performed at the <num> annual grammy awards princess diana 's memorial service in september <year> and at carey 's black entertainment television christmas special in <year>

additionally fantasy was named song of the year at the bmi awards and favorite song at the blockbuster entertainment awards where carey also won the award for top pop female
in <year> carey won many awards at the billboard music awards including hot <num> singles artist of the year hot <num> airplay always be my baby hot adult contemporary artist of the year and special award for <num> weeks at <num> for one sweet day
when the grammy award nominees were announced and daydream was nominated for six different awards critics began raving how it would be cleaning up that year
the <num> annual grammy awards were held on february <num> <year> at the shrine auditorium in los angeles
carey being a multiple award nominee was one of the headlining performers
together with boyz ii men she sang a live rendition of one sweet day to a very positive response
however as the award winners were announced one by one carey watched as her name was not called up even once
daydream had lost all of its six nominations shocking most critics who branded it the album of the year
with every passing loss the television cameras continued to zoom on carey 's face who was finding it more difficult to retain her smile
by the end of the night carey had not won a single award
the disappointment on her face was painfully obvious
while carey was nominated again the following year she did not perform again until the <year> ceremony when she was nominated for eight awards winning three for the emancipation of mimi
additionally she chose the concept and created the idea
the video featured carey in roller @-@ blades blading through a theme @-@ park while enjoying different rides and roller coasters
the video then cut into scenes of carey dancing on top of a car celebrating an event with many friends
carey said her inspiration for the video was to give off a free and open feeling trying to portray the freedom she had finally achieved in being allowed to direct her first video
the video for fantasy debuted on september <num> at the mtv video music awards
carey expressed how much she enjoyed the video 's filming speaking about the roller @-@ coaster scenes they did not expect me to get that shot they were saying how 's she going to sing on a roller coaster
we put a little speaker on the bottom of the car where my feet where
we built the rig in front of the roller coaster and the lens kept falling off when carey and boyz ii men got together to record one sweet day they didn 't have enough time to re @-@ unite and film a video
for this reason a filming crew was present during the song 's recording and filmed bits of carey and boyz recording the song
in an interview with fred bronson walter afanasieff made the following statements regarding the video for one sweet day it was crazy they had film crews and video guys while i 'm at the board trying to produce
and these guys were running around having a ball because mariah and them are laughing and screaming and they 're being interviewed
and i 'm tapping people on the shoulder
we 've got to get to the microphone they 're gone in a couple of hours so i recorded everything they did praying that it was enough
the video for always be my baby was once again filmed by carey
it featured carey swinging on a swing in the middle of a dark meadow showing her frolicking through the woodlands
the video was set as a peaceful and relaxing setting in order to try to reflect the sweet and mellow song 's message
forever the album 's fifth single was the final song to be accompanied by a music video
carey 's label used footage from her live performances of the song in new york city and japan and compiled them into a video
on february <num> <year> carey revealed through her twitter account that a music video for underneath the stars was actually recorded
fantasy contains a sample of genius of love by tom tom club
following an appeal by the fielding side the umpire may rule a batsman out lbw if the ball would have struck the wicket but was instead intercepted by any part of the batsman 's body except the hand holding the bat
the umpire 's decision will depend on a number of criteria including where the ball pitched whether the ball hit in line with the wickets and whether the batsman was attempting to hit the ball
leg before wicket first appeared in the laws of cricket in <year> as batsmen began to use their pads to prevent the ball hitting their wicket
over several years refinements were made to clarify where the ball should pitch and to remove the element of interpreting the batsman 's intentions
the <year> version of the law used a wording that remained in place for nearly <num> years
however from the latter part of the <num> century batsmen became increasingly expert at pad @-@ play to reduce the risk of their dismissal
following a number of failed proposals for reform in <year> the law was expanded such that batsmen could be dismissed lbw even if the ball pitched outside the line of off stump
critics felt this change made the game unattractive as it encouraged negative tactics at the expense of leg spin bowling
after considerable debate and various experiments the law was changed again in <year>
in an attempt to reduce pad @-@ play the new version which is used to this day allowed batsmen to be out lbw in some circumstances if they did not attempt to hit the ball with their bat
since the <num> the availability of television replays and later ball @-@ tracking technology to assist umpires has increased the percentage of lbws in major matches
however the accuracy of the technology and the consequences of its use remain controversial
in his <year> survey of cricket laws gerald brodribb states no dismissal has produced so much argument as lbw it has caused trouble from its earliest days
owing to its complexity the law is widely misunderstood among the general public and has proven controversial among spectators administrators and commentators lbw decisions have sometimes caused crowd trouble
since the law 's introduction the proportion of lbw dismissals has risen steadily through the years
statistics reveal that the probability of a batsman being dismissed lbw in a test match varies depending on where the match is played and which teams are playing
before a batsman can be dismissed lbw the fielding team must appeal to the umpire
for the batsman to be adjudged lbw the ball if it bounces must pitch in line with the wickets or on the off side of the stumps
then the ball must strike part of the batsman 's body without first touching his bat in line with the wickets and have been going on to hit the stumps
the batsman may also be out lbw if having made no attempt to hit the ball with his bat he is struck outside the line of off stump by a ball that would have hit the wickets
the umpire must assume that the ball would have continued on the same trajectory after striking the batsman even if it would have bounced before hitting the stumps
however if the bowler delivers a no ball — an illegal delivery — the batsman cannot be lbw under any circumstances
a batsman can be out lbw even if the ball did not hit his leg for example a batsman struck on the head could be lbw
however he cannot be lbw if the ball pitches on the leg side of the stumps outside leg stump even if the ball would have otherwise hit the wickets
similarly a batsman who has attempted to hit the ball with his bat cannot be lbw if the ball strikes him outside the line of off stump
however some shots in cricket such as the switch hit or reverse sweep involve the batsman switching between a right- and left @-@ handed stance this affects the location of the off and leg side which are determined by the stance
the law explicitly states that the off side is determined by the batsman 's position when the bowler commences his run @-@ up
according to mcc guidelines for umpires factors to consider when giving an lbw decision include the angle at which the ball was travelling and whether the ball was swinging through the air
he must also account for the height of the ball at impact and how far from the wicket the batsman was standing from this information he must determine if the ball would have passed over the stumps or struck them
the mcc guidance states that it is easier to make a decision when the ball strikes the batsman without pitching but that the difficulty increases when the ball has bounced and more so when there is a shorter time between the ball pitching and striking the batsman
at the time batsmen in english cricket used curved bats which made it unlikely that they would be able to stand directly in front of the wickets
however a clause in the <year> laws gave umpires the power to take action if the batsman was standing unfair to strike
cricket bats were modified to become straighter over the following years allowing batsmen to stand closer to the wickets
subsequently some players deliberately began to obstruct the ball from hitting the wickets
such tactics were criticised by writers and a revision of the laws in <year> ruled that the batsman was out if he deliberately stopped the ball from hitting the wicket with his leg
however critics noted that the umpires were left the difficult task of interpreting the intentions of batsmen
the <year> version of the laws no longer required the umpires to take account of the batsman 's intent now a batsman was lbw if he stopped a ball that pitch ed straight
further clarification of the law came in <year> when a condition was added that the ball must be delivered in a straight line to the wicket
the ambiguity of the wording was highlighted when two prominent umpires disagreed over whether the ball had to travel in a straight line from the bowler to the wicket or between the wickets at either end of the pitch
in <year> the mcc by then responsible for drafting the laws of cricket endorsed the latter interpretation and ruled the batsman out lbw if the ball pitched in between the wickets and would have hit the stumps
an <year> proposal to allow a batsman to be lbw if the ball hit his body at any point between the wickets regardless of where the ball pitched or whether it would hit the wicket at all came to nothing
there were few complaints until the proportion of lbw dismissals in county cricket began to increase during the <num>
until then batsmen used their pads only to protect their legs their use for any other purposes was considered unsporting and some amateur cricketers did not wear them at all
as cricket became more organised and competitive some batsmen began to use their pads as a second line of defence they lined them up with the ball so that if they missed with the bat the ball struck the pad instead of the wicket
some players took this further if the delivery was not an easy one from which to score runs they attempted no shot and allowed the ball to bounce safely off their pads
arthur shrewsbury was the first prominent player to use such methods and others followed
criticism of this practice was heightened by the increased quality and reliability of cricket pitches which made batting easier led to higher scores and created a perceived imbalance in the game
several proposals were made to prevent pad @-@ play
at a meeting of representatives of the main county cricket clubs in <year> one representative expressed the opinion that a batsman who defended his wicket with his body instead of with his bat should be punished
the representatives supported a motion to alter the law to state that the batsman would be out if he stopped a ball that would have hit the wicket in contrast to the existing wording this took no account of where the ball pitched relative to the wickets
further proposals included one in which the intent of the batsman was taken into account but no laws were changed and the mcc merely issued a condemnation of the practice of using pads for defence
this reduced pad @-@ play for a short time but when it increased again a second pronouncement by the mcc had little effect
further discussion on altering the law took place in <year> when several prominent cricketers supported an amendment similar to the <year> proposal the batsman would be out if the ball would have hit the wicket where it pitched was irrelevant
at a special general meeting of the mcc in <year> alfred lyttelton formally proposed this amendment the motion was supported by <num> votes to <num> but failed to secure the two @-@ thirds majority required to change the laws
a
g
steel was the principal opponent of the change as he believed it would make the task of the umpires too difficult but he later regretted his stance
lyttelton 's brother robert supported the alteration and campaigned for the rest of his life to have the lbw law altered
as evidence that pad @-@ play was increasing and needed to be curtailed he cited the growing number of wickets which were falling lbw the proportion rose from <num> of dismissals in <year> to <num> in <year> and <num> in <year>
in <year> the proposed new law was tried in the minor counties championship but deemed a failure
an increase in the size of the stumps was one of several other rejected proposals at this time to reduce the dominance of batsmen over bowlers
bowlers grew increasingly frustrated with pad @-@ play and the extent to which batsmen refused to play shots at bowling directed outside the off stump simply allowing it to pass by
the english fast bowler harold larwood responded by targeting leg stump frequently hitting the batsman with the ball in the process
this developed into the controversial bodyline tactics he used in australia in <year> – <num>
some batsmen began to go further and preferred to kick away balls pitched outside off stump — reaching out to kick the ball instead of allowing it to hit their pads — if they presented any threat knowing that they could not be dismissed lbw
the authorities believed these developments represented poor entertainment value
at the height of the bodyline controversy in <year> donald bradman the leading australian batsman and primary target of the english bowlers wrote to the mcc recommending an alteration of the lbw law to create more exciting games
to address the problem and redress the balance for bowlers the mcc made some alterations to the laws
the size of the ball was reduced in <year> and that of the stumps increased in <year> but the changes had little effect
between <year> and <year> county authorities conducted a trial in which a batsman could be lbw if he had hit the ball onto his pads
then in <year> an experimental law was introduced in which the batsman could be dismissed lbw even if the ball pitched outside the line of off stump — in other words a ball that turned or swung into the batsman but did not pitch in line with the wickets
however the ball was still required to strike the batsman in line with the wickets
the umpire signalled to the scorers when he declared a batsman out under the new rule and any such dismissal was designated lbw n on the scorecard
several leading batsmen opposed the new law including the professional herbert sutcliffe known as an exponent of pad @-@ play and amateurs errol holmes and bob wyatt
wisden cricketers almanack noted that these three improved their batting records during the <year> season but batsmen generally were less successful
there were also fewer drawn matches
there was an increase in the number of lbws — out of <num> @,@ <num> lbw dismissals in first @-@ class matches in <year> <num> were given under the amended law
wisden judged the experiment a success and several of its opponents changed their mind by the end of the season batsmen soon became accustomed to the alteration
although australian authorities were less convinced and did not immediately introduce the revision into domestic first @-@ class cricket in <year> the new rule became part of the laws of cricket
according to gerald brodribb in his survey and history of the laws the change produced more enterprising exciting cricket but any alteration in outlook was halted by the second world war
when the sport resumed in <year> batsmen were out of practice and the amended lbw law played into the hands of off spin and inswing bowlers who began to dominate county cricket
the cricket historian derek birley notes that many of these bowlers imitated the methods of alec bedser an inswing bowler who was successful immediately after the war but that the resulting cricket was unexciting to watch
the revised lbw law and other alterations in the game in favour of the bowler further encouraged such bowling
the new law continued to provoke debate among writers and cricketers many former players claimed that the alteration had caused a deterioration in batting and reduced the number of shots played on the off side
a <year> report in the times blamed the law for reducing the variety of bowling styles the change has led to a steady increase in the amount of seam and off @-@ spin bowling
whereas in the early thirties every county had a leg spinner and an orthodox left arm spinner leg spinners at any rate are now few and far between
walk on to any of the first @-@ class grounds at any time tomorrow and the chances are that you will see the wicketkeeper standing back and a medium pace bowler in action
there is little doubt that the game as a spectacle is less attractive than it was
several critics including bob wyatt maintained that the lbw law should be returned to its pre @-@ <year> wording he campaigned to do so until his death in <year>
on the other hand bradman in the <num> proposed extending the law so that batsmen could be lbw even if they were struck outside the line of off stump
an mcc study of the state of cricket carried out in <year> and <year> examined the prevalent and unpopular tactic involving off @-@ spin and inswing bowlers aiming at leg stump with fielders concentrated on the leg side
rather than alter the lbw law to combat the problem the mcc reduced the number of fielders allowed on the leg side
critics continued to regard this tactic as negative and unfair
in an effort to discourage pad @-@ play and encourage leg spin bowling a new variant of the lbw law was introduced initially in australia and the west indies in the <year> – <num> season then in england for <year>
under the re @-@ worded law a batsman would be lbw if a ball destined to hit the stumps pitched in line with the wickets or outside a batsman 's off stump and in the opinion of the umpire he made no genuine attempt to play the ball with his bat
this revision omitted the requirement that the impact should be in line with the wickets but meant that any batsman playing a shot could not be out if the ball pitched outside off stump in contrast to the <year> law
the editor of wisden believed the change encouraged batsmen to take more risks and had produced more attractive cricket
however the proportion of wickets falling lbw sharply declined and concerns were expressed in australia
the australian authorities proposed a reversion to the previous law
a batsman could once more be out to a ball that pitched outside off stump but a provision was added that if no stroke is offered to a ball pitching outside the off @-@ stump which in the opinion of the umpire would hit the stumps but hits the batsman on any part of his person other than the hand then the batsman is out even if that part of the person hit is not in line between wicket and wicket
the difference to the <year> rule was that the batsman could now be out even if the ball struck outside the line of off @-@ stump
this wording was adopted throughout the world although it was not yet part of the official laws from <year> and the percentage of lbws sharply increased to beyond the levels preceding the <year> change
the mcc added the revised wording to the laws of cricket in <year> this version of the lbw law is still used as of <year>
according to cricket historian douglas miller the percentage of lbw dismissals increased after broadcasters incorporated ball @-@ tracking technology such as hawk @-@ eye into their television coverage of matches
miller writes with the passage of time and the adoption of hawkeye into other sports together with presentations demonstrating its accuracy cricket followers seem gradually to have accepted its predictions
replay analyses have shown that a greater proportion of balls striking an outstretched leg go on to hit the wicket than had once been expected
he also suggests that umpires have been influenced by such evidence their greater understanding of which deliveries are likely to hit the stumps has made them more likely to rule out batsmen who are standing further away from the stumps
this trend is replicated in international cricket where the increasing use of technology in reviewing decisions has altered the attitude of umpires
spin bowlers in particular win far more appeals for lbw
however the use of on @-@ field technology has proved controversial some critics regard it as more reliable than human judgement while others believe that the umpire is better placed to make the decision
the international cricket council icc responsible for running the game worldwide conducted a trial in <year> where lbw appeals could be referred to a match official the third umpire to review on television replays
the third umpire could only use technology to determine where the ball had pitched and if the batsman hit the ball with his bat
the icc judged the experiment unsuccessful and did not pursue it
more trials followed in <year> although ball @-@ tracking technology remained unavailable to match officials
after a further series of trials in <year> the umpire decision review system drs was brought into international cricket where teams could refer the on @-@ field decisions of umpires to a third umpire who had access to television replays and technology such as ball tracking
according to the icc 's general manager dave richardson drs increased the frequency with which umpires awarded lbw decisions
in a <year> interview he said umpires may have realised that if they give someone out and drs shows it was not out then their decision can be rectified
so they might i suppose have the courage of their convictions a bit more and take a less conservative approach to giving the batsman out
i think if we 're totally honest drs has affected the game slightly more than we thought it would
critics of the system suggest that rules for the use of drs have created an inconsistency of approach to lbw decisions depending on the circumstances of the referral
opponents also doubt that the ball @-@ tracking technology used in deciding lbws is reliable enough but the icc state that tests have shown the system to be <num> accurate
the board of control for cricket in india bcci have consistently declined to use drs in matches involving india owing to their concerns regarding the ball @-@ tracking technology
early drs trials were conducted during india matches and several problems arose over lbws particularly as the equipment was not as advanced as it later became
the bcci believe the technology is unreliable and open to manipulation
in the <num> around <num> of wickets were lbw but this rose to <num> in the <num>
between <year> and <year> the proportion was approximately <num> but subsequently increased until reaching almost <num> in the decade before <year>
miller also states that captains of county teams were statistically more likely to receive the benefit of lbw decisions — less likely to be out lbw when batting and more likely to dismiss batsmen lbw when bowling
for many years county captains submitted end @-@ of @-@ match reports on the umpires as umpires were professionals whose careers could be affected captains consequently received leeway whether batting or bowling
before <year> when the status was abolished in county cricket umpires were also more lenient towards amateur cricketers
amateurs administered english cricket and offending one could end an umpire 's career
elsewhere in the world lbws are more statistically likely in matches taking place on the indian subcontinent
however batsmen from the subcontinent were less likely to be lbw wherever they played in the world
teams that toured other countries often became frustrated by lbws given against them there was often an assumption of national bias by home umpires against visiting teams
several studies investigating this perception have suggested that home batsmen are sometimes less likely than visiting batsmen to be lbw
however the data is based on lbw decisions awarded not on the success @-@ rate of appeals to the umpire
fraser points out that it is impossible to determine from these studies if any of the decisions were wrong particularly as the lbw law can have different interpretations or if other factors such as pitch conditions and technique were involved
a <year> study examined the effect that neutral umpires had on the rate of lbws
although the reasons were again ambiguous it found that lbws increased slightly under neutral umpires regardless of team or location
in his survey of cricket laws gerald brodribb suggests that no dismissal has produced so much argument as lbw it has caused trouble from its earliest days
among those who do not follow cricket the law has the reputation of being extremely difficult to understand of equivalent complexity to association football 's offside rule
owing to the difficulty of its interpretation lbw is regarded by critics as the most controversial of the laws but also a yardstick by which an umpire 's abilities are judged
in his book cricket and the law the man in white is always right david fraser writes that umpires lbw decisions are frequently criticised and arguments about bias and incompetence in adjudication inform almost every discussion about lbw decisions
problems arise because the umpire has not only to establish what has happened but also to speculate over what might have occurred
controversial aspects of lbw decisions include the umpire having to determine whether the ball pitched outside leg stump and in certain circumstances whether the batsman intended to hit the ball or leave it alone
umpires are frequently criticised for their lbw decisions by players commentators and spectators
historically trouble ranging from protests and arguments to crowd demonstrations occasionally arose from disputed decisions
for example a prolonged crowd disturbance in which items were thrown onto the playing field and the match was delayed took place when mohammad azharuddin was adjudged lbw during a <year> one day international in india

in a <year> interview with pridesource diamandis said that the album 's title came from a slang term for testes but she had been too coy to admit it before
in a review for q writer hugh montgomery noted genres such as disco shampain bubblegum punk girls and cabaret hermit the frog
the opening track are you satisfied ponders the meaning of a fulfilling life a writer for the line of best fit likened it to the thinking of danish existentialist philosopher søren kierkegaard
in a january <year> interview with the daily telegraph diamandis admitted that she cringes at the lyrics of the song girls which could be seen as a bit misogynistic including the lines girls they never befriend me cause i fall asleep when they speak of all the calories they eat she clarified that the lyrics concerned her own psychological problems with weight
a neon gold press release for a limited double a @-@ side of obsessions and mowgli 's road described the former as a bold and ambitious

the panel originally oak was completed some time between <year> and <year> and has been in the national gallery london since <year>
it shows a woman with the pale skin high cheek bones and oval eyelids typical of the idealised portraits of noble women of the period
she is identifiable as the magdalen from the jar of ointment placed in the foreground which is her traditional attribute in christian art
she is presented as completely absorbed in her reading a model of the contemplative life repentant and absolved of past sins
in catholic tradition the magdalen was conflated with both mary of bethany who anointed the feet of jesus with oil and the unnamed sinner of luke <num> <num> – <num>
iconography of the magdalen commonly shows her with a book in a moment of reflection in tears or with eyes averted
van der weyden pays close attention to detail in many passages in particular the folds and cloth of the woman 's dress the rock crystal of the rosary beads held by the figure standing over her and the lushness of the exterior
the background of the painting had been overpainted with a thick layer of brown paint
a cleaning between <year> and <year> revealed the figure standing behind the magdalene and the kneeling figure with its bare foot protruding in front of her with a landscape visible through a window
the two partially seen figures are both cut off at the edges of the london panel
the figure above her has been identified as belonging to a fragment in the museu calouste gulbenkian lisbon which shows the head of saint joseph while another lisbon fragment showing what is believed to be saint catherine of alexandria is thought to be from the same larger work
the original altarpiece was a sacra conversazione known only through a drawing virgin and child with saints in stockholm 's nationalmuseum which followed a partial copy of the painting that probably dated from the late <num> century
the drawing shows that the magdalen occupied the lower right @-@ hand corner of the altarpiece
the lisbon fragments are each a third of the size of the magdalen which measures <num>
<num> cm × <num>
<num> cm <num>
<num> in × <num>
<num> in
although internationally successful in his lifetime van der weyden fell from view during the <num> century and was not rediscovered until the early <num> century
the magdalen reading can first be traced to an <year> sale
after passing through the hands of a number of dealers in the netherlands the panel was purchased by the national gallery london in <year> from a collector in paris
it is described by art historian lorne campbell as one of the great masterpieces of <num> @-@ century art and among van der weyden 's most important early works
here she is based on mary of bethany who is identified as the magdalene in the roman catholic tradition
mary of bethany sat at jesus feet and listened to his word and thus is seen as a contemplative figure
the counterpoint is mary 's sister martha who representative of the active life wished that mary would help her serve
mary is shown by van der weyden as youthful sitting in quiet piety with her head tilted and eyes modestly averted from the viewer
she is absorbed in her reading of a holy book the covers of which include a chemise of white cloth a common form of protective binding
four coloured cloth bookmarks are tied to a gold bar near the top of the spine
according to lorne campbell the manuscript looks rather like a <num> @-@ century french bible and is clearly a devotional text
it was rare for contemporary portraits to show women reading and if the model herself could read then she was likely from a noble family
van der weyden often linked form and meaning and in this fragment the semicircular outline of the magdalene reinforces her quiet detachment from her surroundings
she is seated on a red cushion and rests her back against a wooden sideboard
by her feet is her usual attribute of an alabaster jar in the gospels she brought spices to the tomb of jesus
the view through the window is of a distant canal with an archer atop the garden wall and a figure walking on the other side of the water whose reflection shows in the water
van der weyden 's pose for the magdalene is similar to a number of female religious figures painted by his master robert campin or his workshop
it closely resembles in theme and tone the figure of saint barbara in campin 's werl altarpiece and also the virgin in an annunciation attributed to campin in brussels
typically for a van der weyden the magdalen 's face has an almost sculpted look and the elements of her clothes are conveyed in minute detail
she wears a green robe in medieval art the magdalene is usually depicted naked sometimes clad only in her long hair or in richly coloured dress typically red blue or green almost never in white
her robe is tightly pulled below her bust by a blue sash while the gold brocade of her underskirt is adorned by a jewelled hem
art critic charles darwent observed that the magdalen 's past as a fallen woman is hinted at by the nap in the fur lining of her dress and the few strands of hair loose from her veil
darwent wrote even her fingers absent @-@ mindedly circled suggest completeness
in her mix of purity and eroticism van der weyden 's magdalen feels whole but she isn 't
in the medieval period fur symbolized female sexuality and was commonly associated with the magdalene
medieval historian philip crispin explains that artists such as memling and matsys often portrayed the magdalen in furs and notes that she is noticeably dressed in fur @-@ lined garments in the magdalen reading by rogier van der weyden
the level of detail used in portraying the magdalene has been described by campbell as far exceed ing van eyck
her lips are painted with a shades of vermilion white and red which are mixed into each other to give a transparent look at the edges
the fur lining of her dress is painted in a range of greys running from almost pure white to pure black
rogier gave the fur a textured look by painting stripes parallel to the line of the dress and then feathering the paint before it dried
the gold on the cloth is rendered with a variety of impasto grid and dots of varying colour and size
many of the objects around her are also closely detailed in particular the wooden floor and nails the folds of the magdalene 's dress the costume of the figures in the exterior and the beads of joseph 's rosary
the effect of falling light is closely studied joseph 's crystal rosary beads have bright highlights while subtle delineations of light and shade can be seen in the sideboard 's tracery and in the clasps of her book
mary is absorbed in her reading and seemingly unaware of her surroundings
van der weyden has given her a quiet dignity although he is generally seen as the more emotional of the master netherlandish painters of the era in particular when contrasted with jan van eyck
lorne campbell describes the tiny figure of the woman seen through the window and her reflection in the water as small miracles of painting and says that the attention to detail far exceeds that of jan van eyck and the skill of execution is astounding
he notes that these tiny details would have been impossible for a viewer to observe when the altarpiece was in its intended position
other areas of the panel however have been described as dull and uninspired
one critic wrote that the areas of the floor and most of the cupboard behind her seem unfinished and much too narrow and papery in effect
a number of objects placed on the cupboard are now barely visible save for their bases
the object on the right seated on legs alongside a box is likely a small pitcher possibly a reliquary
a moulding to the left of the cupboard may represent a doorway
the drawing has a loosely sketched background and shows from left to right an unidentified bishop saint with mitre and crosier making a blessing gesture a narrow gap with a few wavy vertical lines suggesting a start at the outline of a further kneeling figure a barefoot bearded figure in a rough robe identified as saint john the baptist a seated virgin holding on her lap the christ child who leans to the right looking at a book and holding the book a kneeling beardless male identified as john the evangelist
the drawing stops at the end of john 's robe at about the point on the london panel where joseph 's walking stick meets john and the magdalene 's robes
this suggests that the magdalene panel was the first to be cut from the larger work
at an unknown point before <year> the original altarpiece was broken into at least three pieces possibly due to damage although the magdalen fragment is in good condition
the black overpaint was likely added after the early <num> century when netherlandish painting had fallen from favour and was unfashionable
campbell believes that after the removal of the background detail it looked sufficiently like a genre piece to hang in a well @-@ known collection of dutch seventeenth @-@ century paintings
from the size of three surviving panels in relation to the drawing it is estimated that the original was at least <num> m high by <num>
<num> m wide the bishop and the magdalene seem to clearly mark the horizontal extremities but the extent of the picture above and below the surviving elements and the drawing cannot be judged
such a size is comparable with smaller altarpieces of the period
the background was overpainted with a thick layer of black brown pigment until it was cleaned in <year> it was only after the layer 's removal that it was linked to the upper body and head of joseph from the lisbon piece
these two works were not recorded in inventory until <year> when they appear in the collection of léo lardus in suresnes france
the london panel shows much of the clothing of two other figures from the original altarpiece
to the left of the magdalene is the red robe of what appears to be a kneeling figure
the figure and robe and less precisely the background match a kneeling saint john the evangelist
behind the magdalen is a standing figure in blue and red robes with linear rosary beads in one hand and a walking stick in the other
a panel at the museu calouste gulbenkian in lisbon shows the head of a figure believed to be the saint joseph the background and clothes match with those of the figure behind the magdalen on the london panel
there is a further small panel in lisbon of a female head richly or royally dressed which first appeared in <year> with the joseph panel when it was recorded in the inventory of leo nardus at suresnes
the figure may represent saint catherine of alexandria and from both the angle of her cloth and the fact that the river behind her would be parallel to that in the exterior of the london panel it can be assumed that she was kneeling
in the stockholm drawing she is omitted or only traces of her dress shown
the joseph panel has a sliver of a view through a window to an exterior scene if the other female is presumed to be kneeling the trees above the waterway aligns with those in the london panel
some art historians including martin davies and john ward have been slow to allow the catherine panel as part of the altarpiece though it is undoubtedly by van der weyden or a near @-@ contemporary follower
evidence against this link includes the fact that the moulding of the window to the left of the gulbenkian female saint is plain while that next to saint joseph is chamfered
such an inconsistency in a single van der weyden work is unusual
the panels are of equal thickness <num>
<num> cm and of near @-@ identical size the saint catherine panel measures <num>
<num> cm × <num>
<num> cm <num>
<num> in × <num>
<num> in the saint joseph <num>
<num> cm × <num> cm <num>

lorne campbell thinks that though the catherine head is obviously less well drawn and less successfully painted than the magdalen it seems likely that all three fragments came from the same original work he points out that about half way up the right edge of this fragment catherine is a small triangle of red outlined by a continuous underdrawn brushstroke
it is likely that the red is part of the contour of the missing figure of the baptist
the small piece is on the outermost edge of the panel and only visible when it was removed from the frame
ward believes the piece corresponds directly with the folds of john 's robes
the stockholm drawing contains a narrow blank gap to the right of the bishop with a few indistinct lines that could represent the lower profile of the kneeling figure of saint catherine
although none of the faces in the three surviving panels match any in the drawing a <year> reconstruction by art historian john ward — which combined all of the works into a composition of a central virgin and child flanked by six saints — is widely accepted
the stockholm drawing 's original location or history before the <num> century is unknown except that the verso shows a surviving carving of the virgin and child attributed to a brussels workshop from about <year>
this carving is also now in portugal
she then became associated with weeping and reading christ 's mercy causes the eyes of the sinner to be contrite or tearful
early renaissance artists often conveyed this idea by portraying contemplative eyes associating tears with words and in turn weeping with reading
examples can be seen in <num> @-@ century works by tintoretto and titian which show the magdalen reading often with her eyes averted towards her book and presumably away from a male gaze or looking up to the heavens or sometimes glancing coyly towards the viewer
writing in the crying face mosche barasch explains that in van der weyden 's time the gesture of averting or concealing the eyes became a pictorial formula for crying
by the medieval period reading became synonymous with devotion which involved withdrawal from public view
van der weyden 's placement of the magdalen in an interior scene reflects the increasing literacy of domestic or laywomen in the mid @-@ <num> century
the increased production of devotional texts showed that noble women of the period routinely read texts such as a psalter or book of hours in the privacy of their homes
whether the magdalen herself was a reader by the <num> century she was firmly established as such in the visual arts
because the magdalen was present at christ 's death and subsequent resurrection she was seen as the bearer of news — a witness — and hence directly associated with the text
the magdalen imagery further draws on the idea of christ as the word represented by a book with the magdalen as the reader learning of her own life story in a moment of reflection and repentance
her devotion to reading reflects her traditional status as the piously repentant harlot as well as a prophetess or seer
according to legend the magdalen lived the last <num> years of her life as a hermit in sainte @-@ baume and is often shown with a book reading or writing symbolizing her later years of contemplation and repentance
by the <num> century she acquired the imagery of a once @-@ shamed woman who clothed in long hair now hid her nakedness in exile and borne by angels floats between heaven and earth
the magdalen 's ointment jar was common in the lexicon of art in van der weyden 's period
mary of bethany may have used a jar when she repented of her sins at christ 's feet in her home by the renaissance the image of the magdalen was of the woman who bathed christ 's feet with her tears and dried them with her hair
she signified the sacrament of anointing chrism and unction by pouring precious spikenard on christ 's feet at his tomb
van der weyden was made painter to the city of brussels in <year> and it is believed to have been painted after this appointment
the national gallery gives before <year>
art historian john ward notes that the altarpiece was one of van der weyden 's first masterpieces created early in his career when he was still heavily influenced by robert campin
he proposes a c
<year> date based on similarities to campin 's werl altarpiece
because van der weyden like most of the early netherlandish painters was not rediscovered until the early <num> century many of his works were wrongly attributed or dated and major pieces such as the berlin miraflores altarpiece continue to emerge
conversely when a number of pieces considered either by van der weyden or assistants under his supervision were cleaned in the mid- to late <num> century his hand or direct influence was disproved or in the case of the magdalen associated with other images whose attribution had been uncertain
the magdalen reading can first be traced to an <year> sale of the estate of cassino a little @-@ known collector in haarlem when the work was already cut down
the painting is recorded in the inventory of demoiselles hoofman also of haarlem
after passing to the nieuwenhuys brothers who were leading dealers in art of the early netherlandish period it moved to the collector edmond beaucousin in paris whose small but choice collection of early netherlandish paintings was purchased for the national gallery london by charles lock eastlake in <year> an acquisition that also included two robert campin portraits and panels by simon marmion <year> – <year>
this was during a period of acquisition intended to establish the international prestige of the gallery
probably before <year> all the background except the red robe on the left and the alabaster jar and floorboards was overpainted in plain brown which was not removed until the cleaning begun in <year>
in general the painted surface is in very good condition although better in the parts that were not overpainted and there are a few small losses
the magdalen reading was transferred from its original oak to a mahogany panel west indian swietenia by unknown craftsmen sometime between <year> and when the national gallery acquired it in <year>
campbell states that the transfer was certainly after <year> probably after <year> and certainly before <year> the year it was acquired by the national gallery
artificial ultramarine @-@ coloured paint found in the transfer ground indicates that the change of panel took place after <year>
the heads in lisbon are still on their original oak panels
the stockholm drawing was discovered in a german inventory c
<year> and is likely of swedish origin
it was bequeathed by a norwegian collector christian langaad to the swedish national museum of fine arts in <year>
it was written by jack burditt and was directed by michael engler

the album is the fourth of yankovic 's to be produced by former the mccoys guitarist rick derringer
recorded between april <year> and september <year> the album was yankovic 's follow @-@ up to his successful <year> release dare to be stupid
the album 's lead single was living with a hernia although it was not a hit and did not chart
the music on polka party is built around parodies and pastiches of pop and rock music of the mid @-@ <num> featuring jabs at james brown mick jagger el debarge and robert palmer
the album also features many style parodies or musical imitations that come close to but do not copy existing artists
these style parodies include imitations of specific artists like the talking heads as well as imitations of various musical genres like country music
peaking at only number <num> on the billboard <num> polka party was met with mixed reviews and was considered a commercial and critical failure
despite this the album was nominated for a grammy award for best comedy recording in <year>
polka party is one of yankovic 's few studio albums not to be certified either gold or platinum by the recording industry association of america riaa and was later demoted to a budget release in <year>
to produce the album yankovic brought in former the mccoys guitarist rick derringer who had also produced yankovic 's previous albums
backing yankovic were jon bermuda schwartz on drums steve jay on bass and jim west on guitar
the album was recorded in roughly three sessions
the first session took place between april <num> and <num> and yielded four originals don 't wear those shoes one of those days dog eat dog and christmas at ground zero
the second session which spanned august <num> – <num> produced three parodies living with a hernia addicted to spuds and here 's johnny
the final session which lasted from august <num> to september <num> produced the parody toothless people an original song named good enough for now and the album 's titular polka medley
thematically yankovic described the record as not a whole lot different than the other albums he had recorded calling the process even a bit formulaic
although don 't wear those shoes is an original composition yankovic admitted that the intro was inspired by the style of the kinks
lyrically the song is a plea by the singer to his wife not to not wear certain shoes which he cannot stand
one of those days is a song detailing horrible things as if they were everyday annoyances
each horrible thing escalates up to global annihilation while more mundane annoyances pop up at different times
dog eat dog is a style parody of the talking heads
described as a tongue @-@ in @-@ cheek look at office life the song was inspired by yankovic 's past experience of working in the mailrooms as well as the traffic department at westwood one radio station
he noted at first i thought the job was kinda cool that i had a phone and a desk and a little cubicle to call my own but after a while i felt like my soul had been sucked out of me
the song features a line directly parodying the talking heads song once in a lifetime sometimes i tell myself this is not my beautiful stapler sometimes i tell myself this is not my beautiful chair this mirrors a similar line in the talking heads song you may tell yourself this is not my beautiful house you may tell yourself this is not my beautiful wife
on april <num> yankovic recorded christmas at ground zero
the song a cheery little tune about death destruction and the end of the world was the result of scotti brothers records insistence that yankovic record a christmas record
after yankovic presented the song to his label they relented because it was a little different from what they were expecting
after the song 's release some radio stations banned the record a move that yankovic attributes to most people not wanting to hear about nuclear annihilation during the holiday season
following the september <num> attacks when the general term ground zero was co @-@ opted as a proper name for the world trade center site where two of those attacks took place the disturbing lyrics caused this song to be banned largely from radio
yankovic wanted the song to receive a video but due to budget reasons his label did not agree
yankovic however directed one himself which was mostly made up of stock footage with a live action finale that was filmed in an economically devastated part of the bronx new york that looked like a bomb had gone off
the final original that was recorded was good enough for now a country music pastiche about how the singer 's lover who while not the best will do for now
the song a spoof of living in america by james brown — which was also the theme to the <year> film rocky iv — is about hernias
when it came time to pick a song to parody as the lead single for polka party scotti brothers records had some very strong ideas and wished to have yankovic parody a musician who was signed on the same label
after living in america became a hit the record label insisted that yankovic parody the song to which yankovic obliged
in order to accurately write the song yankovic researched the various types of hernias
yankovic noted that it was a real thrill to do james brown
i 'm a total non @-@ dancer never went to any dances in high school but if i analytically dissect a dance routine i can figure it out
a choreographer named chester whitmore was hired to accurately create the dance scenes featured in the video which was shot on the concert set actually used in the movie rocky iv
the second parody recorded was addicted to spuds a pastiche of addicted to love by robert palmer about a man 's obsession for potatoes and potato @-@ based dishes
a music video for the song was never made to the song because there was a strict budget for videos for the album and yankovic felt that the video would be one big joke and not really worth its own video
a parody of palmer 's video however was later inserted into al 's uhf video
on august <num> yankovic recorded here 's johnny a parody of who 's johnny by el debarge
the song a loving ode to the tonight show starring johnny carson announcer ed mcmahon features john roarke of the television series fridays fame doing an impression of mcmahon 's voice
according to yankovic peter wolf the man who wrote who 's johnny enjoyed the parody idea so much that he personally brought the floppy disc program that had all the synthesizer parts for the original song into the studio when yankovic was recording his parody
the final parody recorded for the album was toothless people a play on mick jagger 's ruthless people which was recorded on august <num> <year>
the song about elderly people who are missing their teeth was written after yankovic heard it would be the theme to the <year> film ruthless people
assuming the song would be a hit yankovic requested and received permission from jagger to record a parody version
when jagger 's song failed to crack the top <num> yankovic considered not recording his version but because jagger had authorized the parody he decided failing to produce it would be an insult to the artist
therefore he recorded the spoof anyway
the album 's polka medley the titular polka party was recorded on the same day as here 's johnny
this was yankovic 's third polka medley and his only medley to bear the same name as an album
like his other medleys the song is a conglomeration of then @-@ popular songs in music
unlike previous albums yankovic did not undertake a tour to promote polka party instead he opened for the american rock band the monkees yankovic later joked that the monkees merely closed for me
yankovic explained that while it was a fun tour and that the crowds were very enthusiastic the tension between the monkees was obvious on his website he wrote that while the band members are all terrific people individually they didn 't seem to get along all that great when they weren 't on stage
allmusic reviewer eugene chadbourne gave the album three stars and wrote that just about anyone could feel let down by this album
chadbourne was largely critical of the parody choices noting that many of the original versions would be forgotten in fifteen years
christopher thelen from the daily vault gave polka party an f and described it as an album that seemed like it could well have been the last call for yankovic
thelen heavily criticized the record writing that both the parodies and originals were not good and that yankovic was going through the motions
rolling stone awarded the album three @-@ and @-@ a @-@ half stars tying it with the <year> album off the deep end and the <year> release running with scissors as yankovic 's best @-@ rated album
although it was not a critical success the album was nominated for a grammy award for best comedy recording in <year> but lost to bill cosby 's those of you with or without children you 'll understand
despite the album 's lackluster reception many of the songs on the album such as dog eat dog addicted to spuds and christmas at ground zero went on to become fan favorites and live staples
two of the album 's tracks living with a hernia and addicted to spuds appeared on yankovic 's first greatest hits album <year> christmas at ground zero appeared on the second volume <year>
in addition the <year> box set permanent record al in the box contained five of the album 's songs addicted to spuds dog eat dog here 's johnny living with a hernia and christmas at ground zero
only dog eat dog however appeared on yankovic 's <year> essential collection although the <num>
<num> version contained living with a hernia
after it was released the album peaked at number <num> on the billboard <num>
compared to yankovic 's previous albums — dare to be stupid peaked at number <num> and in <num> @-@ d peaked at number <num> — polka party was a major commercial disappointment for the comedian
the album was the lowest @-@ charting studio album released by yankovic and is one of his few studio albums not to be certified either gold or platinum by the recording industry association of america riaa
the others include the soundtrack to his film uhf <year> and poodle hat <year>
due to low sales the album was demoted to a budget release along with various other yankovic albums in august <year>
yankovic was dismayed by the album 's lackluster reception
he noted that he thought it was the end of his career
yankovic explained that i figured i 'd peaked with eat it and like a surgeon and now people were slowly forgetting about me and i was well on my way to obscurity
however yankovic 's next album even worse would resurrect his career and become his best @-@ selling album at the time the experience led yankovic to realize that careers have peaks and valleys and whenever i go through the rough times another peak might be right around the corner
written in february <year> it was first published in poetry a magazine of verse that august and included in kilmer 's <year> collection trees and other poems
the poem in twelve lines of rhyming couplets of iambic tetrameter verse describes what kilmer perceives as the inability of art created by humankind to replicate the beauty achieved by nature
kilmer is most remembered for trees which has been the subject of frequent parodies and references in popular culture
kilmer 's work is often disparaged by critics and dismissed by scholars as being too simple and overly sentimental and that his style was far too traditional and even archaic
despite this the popular appeal of trees has contributed to its endurance
literary critic guy davenport considers it the one poem known by practically everybody
trees is frequently included in poetry anthologies and has been set to music several times — including a popular rendition by oscar rasbach performed by singers nelson eddy robert merrill and paul robeson
the location for a specific tree as the possible inspiration for the poem has been claimed by several places and institutions connected to kilmer 's life — among these are rutgers university the university of notre dame and towns across the country that kilmer visited
however kilmer 's eldest son kenton declares that the poem does not apply to any one tree — that it could apply equally to any
trees was written in an upstairs bedroom at the family 's home in mahwah new jersey that looked out down a hill on our well @-@ wooded lawn
ironically kenton kilmer stated that while his father was widely known for his affection for trees his affection was certainly not sentimental — the most distinguished feature of kilmer 's property was a colossal woodpile outside his home
the kilmers lived on the southwest corner of the intersection of airmount road and armour road in mahwah for five years and the house overlooked the ramapo valley
it was written in the afternoon in the intervals of some other writing
the desk was in an upstairs room by a window looking down a wooded hill
it was written in a little notebook in which his father and mother wrote out copies of several of their poems and in most cases added the date of composition
on one page the first two lines of trees appear with the date february <num> <year> and on another page further on in the book is the full text of the poem
it was dedicated to his wife 's mother mrs
henry mills alden who was endeared to all her family
in <year> the notebook alluded to by kilmer 's son was uncovered by journalist and kilmer researcher alex michelini in georgetown university 's lauinger library in a collection of family papers donated to the university by kilmer 's granddaughter miriam kilmer
the mrs
henry mills alden to whom the poem was dedicated was ada foster murray alden <year> – <year> the mother of kilmer 's wife aline murray kilmer <year> – <year>
alden a writer had married harper 's magazine editor henry mills alden in <year>
although several communities across the united states claim to have inspired trees nothing can be established specifically regarding kilmer 's inspiration except that he wrote the poem while residing in mahwah
both kilmer 's widow aline and his son kenton refuted these claims in their correspondence with researchers and by kenton in his memoir
kenton wrote to university of notre dame researcher dorothy colson mother and i agreed when we talked about it that dad never meant his poem to apply to one particular tree or to the trees of any special region
just any trees or all trees that might be rained on or snowed on and that would be suitable nesting places for robins
i guess they 'd have to have upward @-@ reaching branches too for the line about lifting leafy arms to pray
rule out weeping willows
according to kenton kilmer the upstairs room in which the poem was written looked down the hill over the family 's well @-@ wooded lawn that contained trees of many kinds from mature trees to thin saplings oaks maples black and white birches and i do not know what else
a published interview with joyce kilmer in <year> mentioned the poet 's large woodpile at the family 's mahwah home
while kilmer might be widely known for his affection for trees his affection was certainly not sentimental — the most distinguished feature of kilmer 's property was a colossal woodpile outside his home
the house stood in the middle of a forest and what lawn it possessed was obtained only after kilmer had spent months of weekend toil in chopping down trees pulling up stumps and splitting logs
kilmer 's neighbors had difficulty in believing that a man who could do that could also be a poet
all but one of the lines has the full eight syllables of iambic tetrameter
the eleventh or penultimate line begins on the stressed syllable of the iambic foot and drops the unstressed syllable — an acephalous or headless catalectic line — that results in a truncated seven @-@ syllable iambic tetrameter line
making the meter of a line catalectic can change the feeling of the poem and is often used to achieve a certain effect as a way of changing tone or announcing a conclusion
the poem 's rhyme scheme is rhyming couplets rendered aa bb cc dd ee aa
despite its deceptive simplicity in rhyme and meter trees is notable for its use of personification and anthropomorphic imagery the tree of the poem which kilmer depicts as female is depicted as pressing its mouth to the earth 's breast looking at god and raising its leafy arms to pray
the tree of the poem also has human physical attributes — it has a hungry mouth arms hair in which robins nest and a bosom
rutgers @-@ newark english professor and poet rachel hadas described the poem as being rather slight although it is free of irony and self consciousness except that little reference to fools like me at the end which i find kind of charming
scholar mark royden winchell points out that kilmer 's depiction of the tree indicates the possibility that he had several different people in mind because of the variety of anthropomorphic descriptions
winchell posits that if the tree described were to be a single human being it would be an anatomically deformed one
in the second stanza the tree is a sucking babe drawing nourishment from mother earth in the third it is a supplicant reaching its leafy arms to the sky in prayer
in the fourth stanza the tree is a girl with jewels a nest of robins in her hair and in the fifth it is a chaste woman living alone with nature and with god
there is no warrant in the poem to say that it is different trees that remind the poet of these different types of people
however winchell observes that this series of fanciful analogies
could be presented in any order without damaging the overall structure of his poem
the magazine which had begun publishing the year before in chicago illinois quickly became the principal organ for modern poetry of the english @-@ speaking world publishing the early works of poets who became the major influences on the development of twentieth @-@ century literature including t
s
eliot ezra pound h
d
wallace stevens robert frost and edna st
vincent millay
poetry paid kilmer six dollars to print the poem which was immediately successful
the following year kilmer included trees in his collection trees and other poems published by the george h
doran company
joyce kilmer 's reputation as a poet is staked largely on the widespread popularity of this one poem
trees was liked immediately on first publication in poetry a magazine of verse when trees and other poems was published the following year the review in poetry focused on the nursery rhyme directness and simplicity of the poems finding a particular childlike naivety in trees which gave it an unusual haunting poignancy
however the same review criticized the rest of the book stating much of the verse in this volume is very slight indeed
despite the enduring popular appeal of trees most of joyce kilmer 's works are largely unknown and have fallen into obscurity
a select few of his poems including trees are published frequently in anthologies
trees began appearing in anthologies shortly after kilmer 's <year> death the first inclusion being louis untermeyer 's modern american poetry <year>
journalist and author mark forsyth ranks the first two lines of trees as <num> out of <num> lines in an assessment of the most quoted lines of poetry as measured by google hits
in <year> english professor barbara garlitz recounted that her undergraduate students considered the poem as one of the finest poems ever written or at least a very good one — even after its technical flaws were discussed — because of its simple message and that it paints such lovely pictures
the students pointed to how true the poem is and it appealed to both her students romantic attitude towards nature and their appreciation of life nature solace and beauty because of its message that the works of god completely overshadow our own feeble attempts at creation
considering this sentiment the enduring popularity of trees is evinced by its association with annual arbor day observances and the planting of memorial trees as well as the several parks named in honor of kilmer including the joyce kilmer @-@ slickrock wilderness and joyce kilmer memorial forest tracts within the nantahala national forest in graham county north carolina
trees has been described by literary critic guy davenport as the one poem known by practically everybody
according to journalist rick hampson trees was memorized and recited by generations of students
it comforted troops in the trenches of world war i
it was set to music and set in stone declaimed in opera houses and vaudeville theaters intoned at ceremonies each april on arbor day
according to robert holliday kilmer 's friend and editor trees speaks with authentic song to the simplest of hearts
holliday added that this exquisite title poem now so universally known made his reputation more than all the rest he had written put together and was made for immediate widespread popularity
poet conrad aiken a contemporary of kilmer lambasted his work as being unoriginal — merely imitative with a sentimental bias and trotting out of the same faint passions the same old heartbreaks and love songs ghostly distillations of fragrances all too familiar
aiken characterized kilmer as a dabbler in the pretty and sweet and pale @-@ mouthed clingers to the artificial and archaic
kilmer is considered among the last of the romantic era poets because his verse is conservative and traditional in style and does not break any of the formal rules of poetics — a style often criticized today for being too sentimental to be taken seriously
the entire corpus of kilmer 's work was produced between <year> and <year> when romanticism and sentimental lyric poetry fell out of favor and modernism took root — especially with the influence of the lost generation
in the years after kilmer 's death poetry went in drastically different directions as is seen in the work of t
s
eliot and ezra pound and academic criticism grew with it to eschew the more sentimental and straightforward verse
the poem was criticized by cleanth brooks and robert penn warren in their textbook understanding poetry first published in <year>
brooks and warren were two of the major contributors to the new criticism movement where its supporters opposed using literature as a surrogate for religion
new criticism proponents analyzed poetry on its aesthetic formulae and excluded reader 's response the author 's intention historical and cultural contexts and moralistic bias from their analysis
they attributed the popularity of trees largely to its religious appeal and believed it was a stock response that has nothing to do as such with poetry adding it praises god and appeals to a religious sentiment
therefore people who do not stop to look at the poem itself or to study the images in the poem and think about what the poem really says are inclined to accept the poem because of the pious sentiment the prettified little pictures which in themselves appeal to stock responses and the mechanical rhythm
literary critic mark royden winchell believed that brooks and warren 's criticism of kilmer 's poem was chiefly to demonstrate that it is sometimes possible to learn as much about poetry from bad poems as from good ones
while the accounts of family members and of documents firmly establish mahwah being the place where kilmer wrote the poem several towns throughout the country have claimed that kilmer wrote trees while staying there or that a specific tree in their town inspired kilmer 's writing
local tradition in swanzey new hampshire asserts without proof that kilmer wrote the poem while summering in the town
montague massachusetts claims that either a sprawling maple dominated the grounds near a hospital where kilmer once was treated or a spreading maple in the yard of an old mansion inspired the poem
in new brunswick new jersey kilmer 's hometown the claim involved a large white oak on the cook college campus now the school of environmental and biological sciences at rutgers university
this tree the kilmer oak was estimated to be over <num> years old
because it had been weakened by age and disease the kilmer oak was removed in <year> and in reporting by the new york times and other newspapers the local tradition was repeated with the claim that rutgers said it could not prove that kilmer had been inspired by the oak
currently saplings from acorns of the historic tree are being grown at the site throughout the middlesex county and central new jersey as well as in major arboretums around the united states
the remains of the original kilmer oak are presently kept in storage at rutgers university
because of kilmer 's close identification with roman catholicism and his correspondence with many priests and theologians a tree located near a grotto dedicated to the virgin mary at the university of notre dame in south bend indiana has been asserted as the inspiration for the poem
according to dorothy corson the claim was first made by a priest named henry kemper
there are several accounts that kilmer visited the campus of notre dame to lecture and to visit friends but none of these accounts or occasions date before <year>
in his <year> book of essays entitled the geography of the imagination american writer guy davenport suggests a different inspiration for kilmer 's poem
trees were favorite symbols for yeats frost and even the young pound
but kilmer had been reading about trees in another context the movement to stop child labor and set up nursery schools in slums
margaret mcmillan
had the happy idea that a breath of fresh air and an intimate acquaintance with grass and trees were worth all the pencils and desks in the whole school system
the english word for gymnasium equipment is apparatus
and in her book labour and childhood <year> you will find this sentence apparatus can be made by fools but only god can make a tree
it appears that davenport must have loosely and erroneously paraphrased the sentiments expressed by mcmillan as this exact quote does not appear in her text
instead mcmillan is expressing the observation that several nineteenth @-@ century writers including william rankin william morris and thomas carlyle opposed the effects of machinery on society and craftsmanship and thus eschewed machine @-@ made items
davenport 's observation likely was derived in some way from mcmillan 's examination and quotation of carlyle he carlyle often makes comparisons between men and machines and even trees and machines greatly to the disadvantage of the latter
the more popular musical setting of kilmer 's poem was composed in <year> by american pianist and composer oscar rasbach
this setting had been performed and recorded frequently in twentieth century including ernestine schumann @-@ heink john charles thomas nelson eddy robert merrill perry como and paul robeson
rasbach 's song appeared on popular network television shows including all in the family performed by the puppets wayne and wanda in the muppet show and as an animated feature segment featuring fred waring and the pennsylvanians performing the song in the <year> animated film melody time the last of the short @-@ film anthology features produced by walt disney
rasbach 's setting has also been lampooned most notably in the our gang short film arbor day <year> directed by fred c
newmeyer in which alfalfa played by carl switzer sings the song in a whiny strained voice after a woodsman spare that tree dialogue with spanky george mcfarland sings trees
film critic leonard maltin has called this the poem 's all @-@ time worst rendition
in his album caught in the act victor borge when playing requests responds to a member of the audience sorry i don 't know that doggie in the window
i know one that comes pretty close to it and proceeds to play the rasbach setting of trees
dutch composer henk van der vliet included a setting of trees as the third in a set of five songs written in <year> which included texts by poets christina rossetti percy bysshe shelley kilmer matthew prior and sir john suckling
while keeping with kilmer 's iambic tetrameter rhythm and its couplet rhyme scheme and references to the original poem 's thematic material such parodies are often immediately recognizable as is seen in song of the open road written by poet and humorist ogden nash i think that i shall never see a billboard lovely as a tree
indeed unless the billboards fall i 'll never see a tree at all
a similar sentiment was expressed in a <year> episode of the animated series wacky races titled the wrong lumber race where the villainous dick dastardly chops down a tree and uses it as a roadblock against the other racers declaring proudly i think that i shall never see a roadblock lovely as a tree
further trappist monk poet and spiritual writer thomas merton used kilmer 's poem as a model for a parody called chee e — with a dollar sign purposefully substituted for the letter s — in which merton ridiculed the lucrative sale of homemade cheese by his monastery the abbey of gethsemani in kentucky
this poem was not published during merton 's lifetime
merton often criticized the commodification of monastic life and business for a profit claiming that it affected the well @-@ being of the spirit
in his poem merton attributed his parody to joyce killer @-@ diller
like kilmer merton was a graduate of columbia university and a member of its literary society the philolexian society which has hosted the annual joyce kilmer memorial bad poetry contest since <year>
trees is read at the conclusion of each year 's event
kilmer 's poem was recited in the <year> film superman ii as well as its <year> director 's cut
in the scene villain lex luthor played by gene hackman and others enter superman 's fortress of solitude and comes across a video of an elder john hollis from planet krypton reciting trees as an example of poetry from earth literature
luthor ridicules the poem
adult spiders measure between <num> and <num>
<num> mm in length
the cephalothorax and abdomen are bronze to black in color with reddish brown or yellowish legs
the male has distinctive enlarged chelicerae the mouthparts used for grasping prey and front femora the third and typically largest leg segments
like many jumping spiders z
sexpunctatus males exhibit ritualized courtship and agonistic behavior
this is a reference to the six spots typically occurring on the abdomen of the male
hentz named the species attus sexpunctatus and described it as follows black cephalothorax with the two posterior eyes near the base which is wide and suddenly inclined at nearly a right angle with the upper surface cheliceres with a strong inner tooth and a long curved fang abdomen with six dots and a line in front white feet <num>
<num>
<num>
<num>
first pair with enlarged thighs and quite long
hentz classified a
sexpunctatus in the subgeneric group pugnatoriae which consisted of jumping spiders whose first pair of legs were the longest followed by the fourth pair
later entomologists abandoned this classification which hentz himself admitted was somewhat artificial
in <year> with the recognition of zygoballus as an independent genus american arachnologists george and elizabeth peckham renamed the spider zygoballus sexpunctatus
specimens of z
sexpunctatus are housed at the museum of comparative zoology the british museum the milwaukee public museum the american museum of natural history and the muséum national d 'histoire naturelle
no type specimens are known
the genus zygoballus contains approximately twenty species distributed from the united states to argentina
zygoballus is classified in the subfamily dendryphantinae of the family salticidae jumping spiders
j
kaston adult females are <num>
<num> to <num>
<num> mm in body length while males are <num> to <num>
<num> mm
the peckhams earlier description however gives a length of <num> mm for females and <num> to <num>
<num> mm for males
the cephalothorax of z
sexpunctatus is bronze to black in color
like all zygoballus spiders the cephalothorax is box @-@ like in shape being widest at the posterior lateral eyes
numerous white or pale blue scales cover the clypeus face and chelicerae
this covering extends around the sides of the carapace ending beyond the posterior median eyes
in males the labium is two @-@ fifths as long as the maxillae and as wide as it is long
the chelicerae of males are greatly enlarged and obliquely oriented with each chelicera having a prominent inner tooth and a long curved fang
the legs are reddish brown or sometimes yellowish with the femora of the anterior first pair being darker and enlarged especially in the male
the anterior legs have three pairs of long spines on the ventral surface of the tibia and two pairs of spines on the metatarsus
the peckhams give the following measurements for the lengths of the legs of a male specimen starting with the anterior pair <num>
<num> mm <num>
<num> mm <num> mm <num> mm
in females the fourth pair of legs are the longest
the pedipalp in the male has a single tibial apophysis which tapers gradually
the abdomen is bronze to black with a white basal band and two white transverse bands
the transverse bands are often broken to form six spots
some or all of these spots may be lacking however
zygoballus sexpunctatus is similar in appearance to zygoballus rufipes with whom its range overlaps
the male can be distinguished from z
rufipes by the large spot of white scales at the beginning of the thoracic slope which is lacking in z
rufipes and by the longitudinal division present on the bulb of the pedipalp z
rufipes has a transverse division
the female can best be distinguished by the form of the epigyne the external genital structure
hentz collected his original specimen in north carolina
in <year> the peckhams reported that the species had been collected from north carolina florida texas louisiana and mississippi
a seven @-@ year survey of spider species in western mississippi reported the abundance of z
sexpunctatus as uncommon
a one @-@ year survey in alachua county florida reported the species as rare
specimens have been collected from several ecosystems including old fields river terrace forests flatwoods florida sand pine scrub slash pine forests appalachian grass balds and rice fields
robert and betty barnes reported the species as occurring in broomsedge fields throughout the southeastern piedmont
the species is typically found in the herb stratum among grasses and other short plants and may be collected with a sweep net
as a male approaches a female it will typically raise and spread its first pair of legs and vibrate its abdomen
if the female is receptive it will often vibrate its abdomen as well
the specific patterns of courtship behavior however vary between individuals
z
sexpunctatus males exhibit ritualized agonistic behavior when encountering other males of the same species
this behavior may include many of the same elements as courtship such as raising and spreading the first pair of legs and vibrating the abdomen
during agonistic display males will also extend their pedipalps and fangs
lethal attacks between males appear to be rare however
the spider 's diet typically includes small insects such as aphids and young caterpillars
they have also been known to eat mosquitoes and numerous kinds of small spiders
mud dauber wasps which capture and paralyze spiders as a source of food for their larvae have been shown to prey on both male and female z
sexpunctatus spiders
the spiders hibernated through the winter in an immature form and reached sexual maturity around late april

in <year> the ncaa threatened to revoke the peach bowl 's charter when ticket sales hovered around <num> @,@ <num> with a week to go before the bowl
last @-@ minute sales saved the game as attendance at the <year> game climbed to <num> @,@ <num> and a new television contract allowed the bowl to make a payout of <num> @,@ <num> to each team
still the bowl 's future was in doubt
in the spring of <year> the metro atlanta chamber of commerce macoc took over the peach bowl
the bowl executive director at the time was dick bestwick and he encouraged the chamber to step up its support of the game over what had been provided by the lions club
in <year> the peach bowl had no contractual obligations with college football conferences as its successor the chick @-@ fil @-@ a bowl does today
team selections were made by the peach bowl committee a board of atlanta community members business leaders and organizers of the peach bowl
to form one half of the matchup the committee selected second @-@ place atlantic coast conference team nc state which accepted the bowl bid on november <num> <year> the day of their final regular @-@ season game
the other half of the matchup was virginia tech a football independent that had finished with nine wins one loss and one tie during the regular season and received its invitation one week after the regular season concluded

following the temple game tech returned to its winning ways defeating archrival virginia kentucky richmond and vanderbilt
one week after defeating vanderbilt november <num> <year> tech received an invitation to the <year> peach bowl
those losing seasons also resulted in the firing of head coach tom reed who was replaced by dick sheridan
sheridan 's first game with the wolfpack was at home against east carolina on september <num>
it was an auspicious beginning as nc state won <num> – <num>
after a <num> – <num> tie the next week against pittsburgh the wolfpack won their next two games at home against wake forest and in maryland against maryland

at the time dooley was the winningest head coach in virginia tech history but was under investigation for recruiting violations and had settled a breach @-@ of @-@ contract lawsuit against the university for <num>

the british frigate was hms africaine a new arrival to the indian ocean
she was under the command of captain robert corbet who had served there the previous year
corbet was a notoriously unpopular officer and his death in the battle provoked a storm of controversy in britain over claims that corbet had either committed suicide at the shame of losing his ship been murdered by his disaffected crew or been abandoned by his men who were said to have refused to load their guns while he remained in command
whether any of these rumours were accurate has never been satisfactorily determined but the issue has been discussed in several prominent naval histories and was the subject of at least one lawsuit
the action came about as a direct consequence of the battle of grand port three weeks earlier in which a british squadron had been destroyed in a failed attack on grand port harbour on isle de france
this gave the french forces on the island a significant regional advantage outnumbering the british frigate on the recently captured île bourbon commanded by commodore josias rowley by six to one
british reinforcements were hastily despatched to the area but the french were blockading île bourbon in force and the arriving reinforcements were in constant danger of attack by more powerful french units
africaine was the first ship to reinforce rowley 's squadron but within three days of her arrival in the region was engaged by two french ships while attempting to drive them away from saint denis on île bourbon
corbet was severely wounded in the opening exchanges and subsequently died
although his crew fought hard they were overwhelmed by the french frigates and forced to surrender only for rowley to arrive in hms boadicea and drive off the french warships recapturing africaine
the french led by commodore jacques hamelin were ordered to disrupt british trade in the region particularly targeting the large east indiamen that carried millions of pounds worth of goods between britain and her empire
the british force under commodore josias rowley was tasked with the blockade and eventual capture of the two well defended island bases of the french île bonaparte and isle de france
at the action of <num> may <year> a french frigate named caroline captured two east indiamen sheltering with her prizes at saint paul on île bonaparte
in his first major operation against the islands rowley landed soldiers behind the defences of the harbour and sent his ships into the bay seizing the town and the shipping in the harbour including caroline
one of rowley 's captains who had performed well in this engagement was robert corbet of hms nereide
refitting the caroline as a british warship and renaming her hms bourbonaise rowley placed corbet in command and sent him to britain with despatches
over the following year the french continued to attack british trade convoys achieving important victories at the action of <num> november <year> and the action of <num> july <year> where they captured another five east indiamen as well as numerous smaller merchant ships and a large portuguese frigate
rowley too was active commanding the successful invasion of île bonaparte in july and renaming the island île bourbon basing his squadron at saint paul on the island 's eastern shore
from this base rowley 's ships were ideally positioned to begin a close blockade of isle de france led initially by captain samuel pym in hms sirius
pym sought to reduce french movement by seizing a number of fortified offshore islands starting with île de la passe off grand port
the island was captured but when a french squadron broke through the british blockade and took shelter in grand port pym resolved to attack them
the ensuing battle of grand port was a disaster for rowley 's squadron as pym led four of rowley 's five frigates into the bay without adequately assessing the channel through the coral reefs that sheltered the harbour
as a result two frigates grounded out of range of the enemy and the remaining two were outnumbered in confined waters
in a complicated battle lasting several days two of pym 's frigates were captured and two more had to be scuttled with their entire crews made prisoner
rowley 's reinforcements arrived too late and the british commodore was chased back to saint denis by hamelin 's flagship
while rowley and hamelin had sparred in the indian ocean corbet had made the lengthy journey back to britain
during his time in command of nereide corbet had already developed a reputation as a strict disciplinarian regularly beating his men for the slightest infractions to the extent that he had provoked a brief mutiny on nereide in <year>
his reputation spread before him and when he switched commands with captain richard raggett of hms africaine he was met with a storm of protest from africaine 's crew
although none of the men aboard africaine had served with corbet before his preference for brutal punishment was well known in the navy and the crew sent a letter to the admiralty insisting that they would not serve under him
concerned at what they considered to be mutiny the admiralty sent three popular officers to africaine with the message that if the protest was quietly dropped there would be no courts @-@ martial for mutiny but if not the entire crew would be liable to attack
to emphasise the threat the frigate hms menelaus was brought alongside with her gunports open and her cannon ready to fire
chastened the crew of africaine allowed corbet aboard and the frigate sailed for the indian ocean a few days later carrying instructions for the authorities at madras to prepare an expeditionary force to invade isle de france
there corbet was informed of the disaster at grand port and on his own initiative immediately sailed south to augment rowley 's weakened squadron
arriving off isle de france at <num> <num> on <num> september corbet spotted a french schooner near île ronde and gave chase the schooner sheltering behind the reefs at grand bay on the eastern side of the island
at <num> <num> corbet ordered the frigate 's boats to enter the creek into which the schooner had fled the small craft entering the waterway in the hope of storming and capturing the vessel
as the boats approached french soldiers and militia appeared along the banks and began firing on the british sailors
fire was returned by royal marines in the boats but africaine 's barge grounded soon after the ambush was sprung and became trapped french gunfire killing two men and wounding ten
the other boat reached the grounded and abandoned schooner but the six men aboard were unable to move the vessel unaided and were forced to depart coming under fire which wounded five men before they could escape the french trap
retrieving his boats corbet determined to sail to île bourbon directly
by <num> <num> on <num> september he had arrived at saint @-@ denis and there landed his wounded and came ashore for news learning that two french frigates were just offshore blockading the port
the french ships had spotted africaine in the harbour and despatched the small brig entreprenant to isle de france with information of her whereabouts although corbet had raised flags that successfully deceived the french into believing that his frigate was rowley 's flagship hms boadicea
the french ships were astrée commanded by pierre bouvet and iphigénie formerly one of the british frigates captured at grand port under rené lemarant de kerdaniel
sailing eastwards boadicea came within sight of bouvet 's squadron at <num> <num> and the british flagship followed by the small brigs hms otter and hms staunch
corbet recognised rowley 's intention and joined the attack embarking <num> soldiers from the <num> regiment of foot to replace his losses at grand bay
the french still believing africaine to be boadicea assumed that boadicea was an east indiaman named windham in disguise and fell back towards isle de france before the british force
otter and staunch both fell rapidly behind boadicea while africaine pulled far ahead
by <num> <num> lookouts on africaine could no longer see the other british ships and by <num> <num> boadicea was similarly alone
bouvet realised the lack of cohesion in the british squadron and also recognised that africaine was faster than either of his ships and would soon catch them
as a result he slowed and prepared to meet the british frigate as night fell
corbet now found himself outnumbered and began to launch rockets and flares in the hope of attracting rowley 's attention and as the french closed with africaine he readied his ship for action
<num> nautical miles <num> km behind rowley could see the flares and flashes but was powerless to intercede in the darkness
at <num> <num> on <num> september the gap had closed between africaine and the french ships and at <num> <num> corbet opened fire on astrée with bouvet returning the fire immediately
a cannonball from the second french broadside struck corbet within minutes of the first broadside the ball tearing off his foot above the ankle just as a large wooden splinter thrown from the gunwale struck the thigh of the same leg shattering the bone
corbet was brought below to the ship 's surgeon where the remnant of his leg was hastily amputated and bound and command devolved on lieutenant john crew tullidge
at <num> <num> astrée pulled away from africaine to perform hasty repairs but bouvet 's guns had wrecked africaine 's rigging leaving the british frigate uncontrollable and largely immobile
slowly moving ahead africaine engaged iphigénie at close range but was counter attacked by astrée and found herself assailed on both sides astrée angled in such a position that she was able to rake the british ship inflicting significant damage and casualties
by <num> <num> africaine was in ruins
tullidge was wounded in four places but refused to leave the deck as the ship 's master had been decapitated and the other lieutenant shot in the chest
all three topmasts had collapsed and as guns were dismounted and casualties increased the return fire of africaine became more and more ragged until it stopped entirely at <num> <num> when only two guns were still capable of firing
french fire stopped at <num> <num> first light showing boadicea <num> nautical miles <num>
<num> km away and unable to affect the surrender of africaine which had hauled down its flags at <num> <num>
within minutes a french prize crew boarded the battered frigate and seized the magazine of shot and gunpowder which was shipped to iphigénie whose ammunition was almost exhausted
by <num> <num> africaine was a dismasted hull and corbet was dead in the bowels of the ship although the exact manner of his death was to cause lasting controversy
by <num> <num> boadicea had been joined by otter and staunch and bore down on the french ships and their prize so that by <num> <num> bouvet was persuaded to abandon africaine and tow the damaged iphigénie back to port napoleon
by <num> <num> boadicea pulled alongside africaine and the french prize crew surrendered
rowley later reported that a number of british sailors leaped into the sea at his approach and swam to boadicea requesting that they be allowed to pursue the french ships in the hope of capturing one
rowley dismissed this idea given the shattered state of africaine and instead towed the frigate back to île bourbon shadowed by astrée and iphigénie on the return journey
the french frigates did achieve some consolation in pursuing rowley from a distance running into and capturing the honourable east india company 's armed brig aurora sent from india to reinforce rowley
on <num> september boadicea africaine and the brigs arrived at saint paul africaine sheltering under the fortifications of the harbour while the others put to sea again seeking to drive away the french blockade but unable to bring them to action
bouvet returned to port napoleon on <num> september and thus was not present when rowley attacked and captured the french flagship vénus and commodore hamelin at the action of <num> september <year>
on each occasion however rowley was able to recapture the lost frigate and drive off the french attackers
corbet 's action was particularly violent british casualties totalling <num> killed and <num> wounded including every single officer and all but three of the soldiers embarked
africaine was seriously damaged and would not be ready to return to active service for some months
french losses were less severe astrée suffering one killed and two wounded iphigénie nine killed and <num> wounded
the action was considered a defeat by the admiralty and was not reported in the london gazette
the british naval authorities were particularly disturbed by rumours that began to circulate concerning the death of captain corbet and the behaviour of his crew during the battle
prominent among these rumours was the suggestion that corbet had been murdered by his disaffected crew historian william james wrote in <year> that there are many who will insist that captain corbett 's sic death @-@ wound was inflicted by one of his own people
although he goes on to point out the unlikelihood of corbet being shot by one of his own cannon
he gives more credence to the story that corbet committed suicide to avoid the shame of defeat that he cut the bandages from his amputated limb and suffered himself to bleed to death
this story was also alluded to in edward pelham brenton 's <year> history corbet did not we fear would not survive his capture
the truth of corbet 's end will never be known with certainty although james ultimately concludes that corbet 's wound was almost certainly a mortal one and thus the most likely cause of death
a second accusation and one that proved even more controversial in the aftermath of the engagement was the claim that africaine 's crew abandoned their guns refused to load them or deliberately fired them into the sea in protest at corbet 's behaviour
corbet 's brutality was well known in the navy james describing him as an excessively severe officer who had a career of cruelty
james does not accuse the crew of any deliberate attempt to sabotage their ship in the engagement instead attributing their poor gunnery to corbet 's own failings as a commander most significantly his failure to practice gunnery regularly
other authors were less understanding of the crew of africaine brenton stating that they cut the breechings of their guns and put no shot in them after the first or second broadside while historian basil hall baldly stated in <year> that they preferred to be mown down by the french broadsides than fight under corbet
this last accusation provoked outrage among naval officers and captain jenkin jones a former shipmate of corbet launched a successful lawsuit forcing hall to make a retraction
in <year> william laird clowes commented that there is unfortunately much reason to suppose that captain corbett 's sic reputation for extreme severity had antagonised his crew and that the men did not behave as loyally as they should have behaved
he later castigates brenton for the suggestion that corbet committed suicide suggesting that the wound alone was the cause of death
modern historians have also been scathing of corbet 's behaviour robert gardiner calling him notoriously brutal and richard woodman describing tullidge as an unfortunate victim of corbet 's cruelty for suspicions lingered that africaine 's brutalised crew had failed to do their utmost in support of their hated commander

jane dudley belonged also to the courtly sympathizers of anne askew whom she contacted during her imprisonment in <year> – <year>
the forthright protestant was burnt at the stake as a heretic in july <year> on the contrivance of the religiously conservative court party around bishop stephen gardiner
renaissance humanism and science figured large in the dudley children 's education

in october <year> the protector lost his power in a trial of strength with the privy council from which john dudley earl of warwick emerged as lord president of the council and leader of the government
somerset who had been imprisoned in the tower of london was soon allowed to rejoin the council
before his release the duchess of somerset and the countess of warwick had arranged daily banquets in order to reconcile their husbands
a marriage between their respective eldest son and daughter anne seymour and john dudley was equally promoted by the two ladies
in june <year> a grand wedding was staged at the palace of sheen attended by the twelve @-@ year @-@ old king edward
jane dudley continued as a great lady at court during the ascendancy of her husband who became duke of northumberland in october <year>

two of their younger children were concerned guildford aged about <num> married lady jane grey while katherine who was between eight and ten years old was promised to the earl of huntingdon 's heir henry hastings
a few months later these matches came to be seen as proof of a conspiracy by the duke of northumberland to bring his family to the throne
at the time the marriages took place however their dynastical implications were not considered significant by even the most suspicious of observers the imperial ambassador jehan de scheyfye
modern historians have considered them either as part of a plot or as routine actions of dynastic politics in the words of david loades
the initiative for the matches had probably come from the marchioness of northampton
after edward 's death on <num> july <year> northumberland undertook the enforcement of the king 's will
lady jane grey accepted the crown only after remonstrances by her parents and parents @-@ in @-@ law
on <num> july the duchess of northumberland accompanied her son and daughter @-@ in @-@ law on their ceremonial entry into the tower of london where they were to reside for the rest of the short reign
according to jane 's own exculpatory letter to queen mary a few months later guildford now wanted to be made king
the young people agreed on having him declared king by act of parliament but then jane changed her mind and declared she would only make him a duke
i will not be a duke i will be king guildford replied and went to fetch his mother
furious the duchess took the side of her son before she told him to leave the tower and go home
jane however insisted that he remain at court
according to her the duchess also induced her son not to sleep with me any more and it is clear from her writings that jane disliked her mother @-@ in @-@ law
when her letter arrived on <num> july <year> during dinner the duchess of suffolk jane 's mother and the duchess of northumberland broke into tears
mary was gathering strength and on <num> july the duke marched to cambridge with troops to capture her

his wife was still in the tower but was soon released
she tried to intercede personally for her imprisoned husband and five sons with mary who was staying outside london
however five miles before reaching the court the duchess was turned away on the queen 's orders
she then wrote a letter to her friend lady paget the wife of william lord paget asking her to plead with the queen 's ladies for her husband 's life
her plea if it went not unheard was in vain and the duke of northumberland was executed on <num> august <year> on tower hill after having recanted his protestant faith
following wyatt 's rebellion guildford dudley was beheaded on <num> february <year> shortly before his wife

in the autumn of <year> the dudley brothers were released from the tower though the eldest john died immediately afterwards at sidney 's house penshurst in kent
at the same location philip sidney was born on <num> november <year>
his godmother was his grandmother jane dudley while his godfather was philip of spain
amid the confiscation of the dudley family 's possessions in july <year> mary had allowed jane dudley to retain her wardrobe and plate carpets and other household stuffs as well as the use of the duke 's house in chelsea london
there she died on either <num> or <num> january <year> and was buried on <num> february at chelsea old church
in her will she tried to provide for her sons financially and thanked the queen as well as the many spanish nobles she had lobbied
the duchess of alba was to receive her green parrot to don diego de acevedo she gave the new bed of green velvet with all the furniture to it beseeching him even as he hath in my lifetime showed himself like a father and a brother to my sons so shall i require him no less to do now their mother is gone
she also remembered my lord my dear husband and stipulated in no wise let me be opened after i am dead
i have not lived to be very bold before women much more i should be loth to come into the hands of any living man be he physician or surgeon
she avoided to be specific on religion but stressed that who ever doth trust to this transitory world as i did may happen to have an overthrow as i had therefore to the worms will i go as i have before written
the cathedral — dedicated to the holy trinity — was established in <num> on land granted by king alexander ii outside the burgh of elgin and close to the river lossie
it replaced the cathedral at spynie <num> kilometres <num>
<num> mi to the north that was served by a small chapter of eight clerics
the new and bigger cathedral was staffed with <num> canons in <num> and then increased to <num> by <num>
after a damaging fire in <num> a rebuilding programme greatly enlarged the building
it was unaffected by the wars of scottish independence but again suffered extensive fire damage in <num> following an attack by robert iii 's brother alexander stewart earl of buchan also known as the wolf of badenoch
in <year> the cathedral precinct again suffered an incendiary attack by the followers of the lord of the isles
the number of clerics required to staff the cathedral continued to grow as did the number of craftsmen needed to maintain the buildings and surrounds
the number of canons had increased to <num> by the time of the scottish reformation in <year> when the cathedral was abandoned and its services transferred to elgin 's parish church of st giles
after the removal of the lead that waterproofed the roof in <year> the cathedral steadily fell into decay
its deterioration was arrested in the <num> century by which time the building was in a substantially ruinous condition
the cathedral went through periods of enlargement and renovation following the fires of <num> and <num> that included the doubling in length of the choir the provision of outer aisles to the northern and southern walls of both the nave and choir
today these walls are at full height in places and at foundation level in others yet the overall cruciform shape is still discernible
a mostly intact octagonal chapter house dates from the major enlargement after the fire of <num>
the gable wall above the double door entrance that links the west towers is nearly complete and was rebuilt following the fire of <num>
it accommodates a large window opening that now only contains stub tracery work and fragments of a large rose window
recessed and chest tombs in both transepts and in the south aisle of the choir contain effigies of bishops and knights and large flat slabs in the now grass @-@ covered floor of the cathedral mark the positions of early graves
the homes of the dignitaries and canons or manses stood in the chanonry and were destroyed by fire on three occasions in <num> <num> and <year>
the two towers of the west front are mostly complete and were part of the first phase of construction
only the precentor 's manse is substantially intact two others have been incorporated into private buildings
a protective wall of massive proportions surrounded the cathedral precinct but only a small section has survived
the wall had four access gates one of which — the pans port — still exists
it is uncertain whether there were bishops of moray before c
<num> but the first known prelate — possibly later translated to dunkeld — was gregory or gregoir
he was probably bishop in name only with the first resident diocesan being richard of lincoln
gregory was a signatory to the foundation charter of scone priory issued by alexander i alaxandair mac maíl choluim between december <num> and april <num> and again in a charter defining the legal rights of the same monastery
he is recorded for the last time when he witnessed a charter granted by david i to dunfermline abbey in c
<num>
after the suppression of óengus of moray 's rebellion in <num> king david must have regarded the continued presence of bishops in moray as essential to the stability of the province
these early bishops had no settled location for their cathedral and sited it successively at the churches of birnie kinneddar and spynie
pope innocent iii issued an apostolic bull on <num> april <num> that allowed bishop bricius de douglas to fix his cathedral church at spynie — its inauguration was held between spring <num> and summer <num>
a chapter of five dignitaries and three ordinary canons was authorised and based its constitution on that of lincoln cathedral
elgin became the lay centre of the province under david i who probably established the first castle in the town and it may have been this castle with its promise of better security that prompted bricius before july <num> to petition the pope to move the seat from spynie
the bishop of caithness and the dean of ross performed the translation ceremony on <num> july <num>
on <num> july alexander ii alaxandair mac uilliam had agreed to the transference in an edict that referred to his having given the land previously for this purpose
the land grant predated the papal mandate and there is evidence that building had started in around <num>
construction of the cathedral was completed after <num>
chronicler john of fordun recorded without explanation that in <num> the cathedral church and the canons houses had burned down
the cathedral was rebuilt in a larger and grander style to form the greater part of the structure that is now visible work that is supposed to have been completed by the outbreak of the wars of scottish independence in <num>
although edward i of england took an army to elgin in <num> and again in <num> the cathedral was left unscathed as it was by his grandson edward iii during his assault on moray in <num>
soon after his election to the see in <num> – <num> bishop alexander bur requested funds from pope urban v for repairs to the cathedral citing neglect and hostile attacks
in august <num> bur began protection payments to alexander stewart lord of badenoch known as the wolf of badenoch who became earl of buchan in <num> and who was son of the future king robert ii
numerous disputes between bur and buchan culminated in buchan 's excommunication in february <num> and the bishop turning to thomas dunbar son of the earl of moray to provide the protection service
these acts by the bishop and any frustration buchan may have felt about the reappointment of his brother robert stewart earl of fife as guardian of scotland may have caused him to react defiantly in may he descended from his island castle on lochindorb and burned the town of forres followed in june by the burning of elgin and the cathedral with its manses
it is believed that he also burned pluscarden priory at this time which was officially under the bishop 's protection
bur wrote to robert iii seeking reparation for his brother 's actions in a letter stating robert iii granted bur an annuity of £ <num> for the period of the bishop 's lifetime and the pope provided income from the scottish church during the following decade
in <year> bur wrote to the abbot of arbroath complaining that the abbot 's prebendary churches in the moray diocese had not paid their dues towards the cathedral restoration
in the same year bur wrote to the rector of aberchirder church telling him that he now owed three years arrears of the subsidy that had been imposed on non @-@ prebendary churches in <num>
again on <num> july <year> the burgh and cathedral precinct were attacked this time by alexander of lochaber brother of domhnall of islay lord of the isles he spared the cathedral but burned the manses
for this act lochaber and his captains were excommunicated prompting lochaber 's return in september to give reparation and gain absolution
in <year> the money saved during an ecclesiastic vacancy was diverted to the rebuilding process and in <year> a grant from the customs of inverness was provided
increasingly the appropriation of the parish church revenues led in many cases to churches becoming dilapidated and unable to attract educated priests
by the later middle ages the standard of pastoral care outside the main burghs had significantly declined
bishop john innes <year> – <num> contributed greatly to the rebuilding of the cathedral as evidenced by the inscription on his tomb praising his efforts
when he died the chapter met secretly — in quadam camera secreta in campanili ecclesie moraviensis — and agreed that should one of their number be elected to the see the bishop would grant one third of the income of the bishopric annually until the rebuilding was finished
the major alterations to the west front were completed before <year> and contain the arms of bishop columba de dunbar <year> – <num> and it is presumed that both the north and south aisles of the choir were finished before <year> as the south aisle contains the tomb of john de winchester <year> – <num>
probably the last important rebuilding feature was the major restructuring of the chapterhouse between <year> and <year> which contains the arms of bishop andrew stewart
often the bishop was the titular head of the chapter only and was excluded from its decision @-@ making processes the chapter being led by the dean as its superior
as the diocese of moray based its constitution on that of lincoln cathedral the bishop was allowed to participate within the chapter but only as an ordinary canon
moray was not unique in this the bishops of aberdeen brechin caithness orkney and ross were also canons in their own chapters
each morning the canons held a meeting in the chapterhouse where a chapter from the canonical rule book of st benedict was read before the business of the day was discussed
bishop bricius 's chapter of eight clerics consisted of the dean precentor treasurer chancellor archdeacon and three ordinary canons
his successor bishop andreas de moravia greatly expanded the chapter to cater for the much enlarged establishment by creating two additional hierarchical posts succentor and subdean and added <num> more prebendaries
in total <num> prebendaries had been created by the time of andreas death and a further two were added just before the scottish reformation
prebendary churches were at the bestowal of the bishop as the churches either were within the diocesan lands or had been granted to the bishop by a landowner as patronage
in the case of elgin cathedral the de moravia family of which bishop andreas was a member is noted as having the patronage of many churches given as prebends
rural deans or deans of christianity as they were known in the scottish church supervised the priests in the deaneries and implemented the bishop 's edicts
there were four deaneries in the moray diocese — elgin inverness strathspey and strathbogie — and these provided the income not only for the cathedral and chapter but also for other religious houses within and outside the diocese
many churches were allocated to support designated canons and a small number were held in common
the bishop received mensal and prebendary income in his separate positions as prelate and canon
the government of the diocese affecting both clergy and laity was vested entirely in the bishop who appointed officers to the ecclesiastical criminal and civil courts
the bishop assisted by his chapter produced the church laws and regulations for the bishopric and these were enforced at occasional diocesan synods by the bishop or in his absence by the dean
appointed officials adjudicated at consistory courts looking at matters affecting tithes marriages divorces widows orphans wills and other related legal matters
in moray these courts were held in elgin and inverness
by <year> the bishop of moray held all his lands in one regality and had courts of regality presided over by bailiffs and deputies to ensure the payment of revenues from his estates
bishop andreas allowed for the canons to be aided by seventeen vicars made up of seven priests five deacons and five sub @-@ deacons — later the number of vicars was increased to twenty five
in <num> the vicars at elgin could not live on their stipends and bishop john of pilmuir provided them with the income from two churches and the patronage of another from thomas randolph second earl of moray
by <year> one vicar had a stipend of <num> marks six others <num> marks one eight marks three seven marks and six received five marks each vicar was employed directly by a canon who was required to provide four months notice in the event of his employment being terminated
the vicars were of two kinds the vicars @-@ choral who worked chiefly in the choir taking the main services and the chantry chaplains who performed services at the individual foundation altars though there was some overlapping of duties
although the chapter followed the constitution of lincoln the form of divine service copied that of salisbury cathedral
it is recorded that elgin 's vicars @-@ choral were subject to disciplinary correction for shortcomings in the performance of the services resulting in fines
more serious offences could end in corporal punishment which was administered in the chapterhouse by the sub @-@ dean and witnessed by the chapter
king alexander ii founded a chaplaincy for the soul of king duncan i who died in battle with macbeth near elgin
the chapel most frequently referenced in records was st thomas the martyr located in the north transept and supported by five chaplains
other chaplaincies mentioned are those of the holy rood st catherine st duthac st lawrence st mary magdalene st mary the virgin and st michael
by the time of bishop bur 's episcopate <num> – <num> the cathedral had <num> canons excluding dignitaries <num> vicars @-@ choral and about the same number of chaplains
despite these numbers not all the clergy were regularly present at the services in elgin cathedral
absence was an enduring fact of life in all cathedrals in a period when careerist clerics would accept positions in other cathedrals
this is not to say that the time spent away from the chanonry was without permission as some canons were appointed to be always present while others were allowed to attend on a part @-@ time basis
the dean of elgin was permanently in attendance the precentor chancellor and treasurer were available for half the year
the non @-@ permanent canons had to attend continuously for three months
the chapter decided in <num> to penalise persistently absent canons who broke the terms of their attendance by removing one seventh of their income
in the diocese of aberdeen and it is assumed in other bishoprics also when important decisions of the chapter had to be taken an absentee canon had to appoint a procurator to act on his behalf — this was usually one of the dignitaries who had a higher likelihood of being present
at elgin in <year> many canons were not abiding by the terms of their leave of absence resulting in each of them receiving a formal warning and a summons despite this ten canons refused to attend and had a seventh of their prebendary income deducted
the bulk of the workload fell to the vicars and a smaller number of permanent canons who were responsible for celebrating high mass and for leading and arranging sermons and feast day processions
seven services were held daily most of which were solely for the clergy and took place behind the rood screen which separated the high altar and choir from lay worshipers
only cathedrals collegiate churches and large burgh churches were resourced to perform the more elaborate services the services in the parish churches were more basic
the clergy were augmented by an unknown number of lay lawyers and clerks as well as masons carpenters glaziers plumbers and gardeners
master gregory the mason and master richard the glazier are mentioned in the chartulary of the cathedral
a substantial wall over <num>
<num> metres <num> ft high <num> metres <num> ft <num> in thick and around <num> metres <num> @,@ <num> ft in length enclosed the cathedral and manses and separated the church community from the laity only the manse of rhynie lay outside the west wall
the houses of <num> vicars and the many chaplains were also situated outside the west wall
the wall had four gates the west port gave access to the burgh the north port provided access to the road to the bishop 's palace of spynie the south port opened opposite the hospital of maison dieu and the surviving east or panns port allowed access to the meadowland called le pannis
the panns port illustrates the portcullis defences of the gate @-@ houses fig
<num>
each canon or dignitary was responsible for providing his own manse and was built to reflect his status within the chapter
the castle having become unsuitable edward i of england stayed at the manse of duffus on <num> and <num> september <num> as did james ii in <year>
in <year> a century after the incendiary attack on the cathedral and precinct in <num> and <year> the cathedral records revealed a chanonry still lacking many of its manses
the chapter ordered that <num> canons including the succentor and the archdeacon should immediately erect construct build and duly repair their manses and the enclosures of their gardens within the college of moray
the manse of the precentor erroneously called the bishop 's house is partially ruined and is dated <year>
fig
<num> vestiges of the dean 's manse and the archdeacon 's manse fig
<num> are now part of private buildings
the hospital of maison dieu dedicated to st mary and situated near the cathedral precinct but outside the chanonry was established by bishop andreas before <num> for the aid of the poor
it suffered fire damage in <num> and again in <year>
the cathedral clerks received it as a secular benefice but in later years it may in common with other hospitals have become dilapidated through a lack of patronage
bishop james hepburn granted it to the blackfriars of elgin on <num> november <year> perhaps in an effort to preserve its existence
the property was taken into the ownership of the crown after the reformation and in <year> was granted to the burgh by james vi for educational purposes and for helping the poor
in <year> an almshouse was constructed to replace the original building but in <year> a storm substantially damaged its relatively intact ruins
the remnants of the original building were finally demolished during a <num> @-@ century redevelopment of the area
there were two friaries in the burgh
the dominican black friars friary was founded in the western part of the burgh around <num>
the franciscan friars minor conventual grey friars friary was later founded in the eastern part of the burgh sometime before <num>
it is thought that this latter grey friars foundation did not long survive but was followed between <year> and <year> by the foundation of a friary near elgin cathedral by the franciscan observants grey friars
the building was transferred into the ownership of the burgh around <year> and later became the court of justice in <year>
in <year> the chapter founded a school that was not purely a song school for the cathedral but was also to be available to provide an education in music and reading for some children of elgin
scottish cathedrals now survived only if they were used as parish churches and as elgin had been fully served by the kirk of st giles its cathedral was abandoned
an act of parliament passed on <num> february <year> authorised regent lord james stewart 's privy council to order the removal of the lead from the roofs of both elgin and aberdeen cathedrals to be sold for the upkeep of his army but the overladen ship that was intended to take the cargo to holland capsized and sank in aberdeen harbour
in <year> john taylor the water poet described elgin cathedral as a faire and beautiful church with three steeples the walls of it and the steeples all yet standing but the roofes windowes and many marble monuments and tombes of honourable and worthie personages all broken and defaced
decay had set in and the roof of the eastern limb collapsed during a gale on <num> december <year>
in <year> the general assembly ordered gilbert ross the minister of st giles kirk to remove the rood screen which still partitioned the choir and presbytery from the nave
ross was assisted in this by the lairds of innes and brodie who chopped it up for firewood
it is believed that the destruction of the great west window was caused by oliver cromwell 's soldiers sometime between <year> and <year>
at some point the cathedral grounds had become the burial ground for elgin
the town council arranged for the boundary wall to be repaired in <year> but significantly the council ordered that the stones from the cathedral should not be used for that purpose
although the building was becoming increasingly unstable the chapterhouse continued to be used for meetings of the incorporated trades from <year> to <year> and then again from <year> to around <year>
no attempt was made to stabilise the structure and on easter sunday <year> the central tower gave way demolishing the nave
following this collapse the quarrying of the cathedral 's stone work for local projects began
many artists visited elgin to sketch the ruins and it is from their work that the slow but continuing ruination can be observed
by the closing years of the <num> century travellers to elgin began to visit the ruin and pamphlets giving the history of the cathedral were prepared for those early tourists
in <year> samuel johnson recorded a paper was put into our hands which deduced from sufficient authorities the history of this venerable ruin
since the abolition of bishops within the scottish church in <year> ownership of the abandoned cathedral fell to the crown but no attempt to halt the decline of the building took place
acknowledging the necessity to stabilise the structure the elgin town council initiated the reconstruction of the perimeter wall in <year> and cleared debris from the surrounding area in about <year>
the lord provost of elgin petitioned the king 's remembrancer for assistance to build a new roof for the chapterhouse and in <year> £ <num> was provided to the architect robert reid for its construction
reid was significant in the development of a conservation policy for historical buildings in scotland and was to become the first head of the scottish office of works sow in <year>
it was probably during his tenure at the sow that the supporting buttresses to the choir and transept walls were built
in <year> john shanks an elgin shoemaker and an important figure in the conservation of the cathedral started his work
sponsored by local gentleman isaac forsyth shanks cleared the grounds of centuries of rubbish dumping and rubble
shanks was officially appointed the site 's keeper and watchman in <year>
although his work was highly valued at the time and brought the cathedral back into public focus his unscientific clearance work may have resulted in much valuable evidence of the cathedral 's history being lost
he died on <num> april <year> aged <num>
a fortnight later the inverness courier published a commemorative piece on shanks calling him the beadle or cicerone of elgin cathedral and writing some minor works took place during the remainder of the <num> century and continued into the early <num> century
during the <num> further maintenance work ensued that included a new roof to protect the vaulted ceiling of the south choir aisle
from <year> onwards the crumbling sandstone blocks were replaced and new windows were fitted in the chapterhouse which was re @-@ roofed to preserve its vaulted ceiling
from <year> to <year> the two western towers were substantially overhauled with a viewing platform provided at the top of the north tower
this early structure had a choir without aisles and more truncated and a nave with only a single aisle on its north and south sides fig
<num>
the central tower rose above the crossing between the north and south transepts and may have held bells in its upper storey
the north wall of the choir is the earliest extant structure dating to the years immediately after the church 's <num> foundation the clerestory windows on top of it are from the later post @-@ <num> reconstruction
this wall has blocked up windows extending to a low level above ground indicating that it was an external wall and proving that the eastern limb then had no aisle fig
<num>
the south transept 's southern wall is nearly complete displaying the fine workmanship of the first phase
it shows the gothic pointed arch style in the windows that first appeared in france in the mid @-@ <num> century and was apparent in england around <num> but hardly appeared in scotland until the early <num> century
it also shows the round early norman window design that continued to be used in scotland during the entire gothic period fig
<num>
the windows and the quoins are of finely cut ashlar sandstone
a doorway in the south @-@ west portion of the wall has large mouldings and has a pointed oval window placed above it
adjacent to the doorway are two lancet @-@ arched windows that are topped at the clerestory level with three round @-@ headed windows
the north transept has much less of its structure preserved but much of what does remain taken together with a study by john slezer in <year> shows that it was similar to the south transept except that the north transept had no external door and featured a stone turret containing a staircase
the west front has two <num> century buttressed towers <num>
<num> metres <num> ft high that were originally topped with wooden spires covered in protective lead
although the difference between the construction of the base course and the transepts suggests that the towers were not part of the initial design it is likely that the building process was not so far advanced that the masons could fully integrate the nave and towers into each other fig
<num>
outer aisles were added to the nave the eastern wing comprising the choir and presbytery was doubled in length and had aisles provided on its north and south sides and the octagonal chapterhouse was built off the new north choir aisle figs
<num> <num>
the new northern and southern aisles ran the length of the choir past the first bay of the presbytery and contained recessed and chest tombs
the south aisle of the choir contained the tomb of bishop john of winchester suggesting a completion date for the reconstructed aisle between <year> and <year> fig
<num>
chapels were added to the new outer aisles of the nave and were partitioned from each other with wooden screens
the first bay at the west end of each of these aisles and adjacent to the western towers did not contain a chapel but instead had an access door for the laity
in june <num> alexander stewart robert iii 's brother burned the cathedral manses and burgh of elgin
this fire was very destructive requiring the central tower to be completely rebuilt along with the principal arcades of the nave
the entire western gable between the towers was reconstructed and the main west doorway and chapterhouse were refashioned
the internal stonework of the entrance is late <num> or early <num> century and is intricately carved with branches vines acorns and oak leaves
a large pointed arch opening in the gable immediately above the main door contained a series of windows the uppermost of which was a circular or rose window dating from between <year> and <year>
just above it can be seen three coats of arms on the right is that of the bishopric of moray in the middle are the royal arms of scotland and on the left is the armorial shield of bishop columba dunbar fig
<num>
the walls of the nave are now very low or even at foundation level except one section in the south wall which is near its original height
this section has windows that appear to have been built in the <num> century to replace the <num> century openings they may have been constructed following the <num> attack fig
<num>
nothing of the elevated structure of the nave remains but its appearance can be deduced from the scarring seen where it attached to the eastern walls of the towers
nothing of the crossing now remains following the collapse of the central tower in <year>
elgin cathedral is unique in scotland in having an english style octagonal chapterhouse and french influenced double aisles along each side of the nave in england only chichester cathedral has similar aisles
the chapterhouse which had been attached to the choir through a short vaulted vestry required substantial modifications and was now provided with a vaulted roof supported by a single pillar figs
<num> <num>
the chapterhouse measures <num>
<num> metres <num> ft high at its apex and <num>
<num> metres <num> ft from wall to opposite wall it was substantially rebuilt by bishop andrew stewart <year> – <year> whose coat of arms is placed on the central pillar
bishop andrew was the half @-@ brother of king james ii
the delay to the completion of these repairs until this bishop 's episcopacy demonstrates the extent of the damage from the <num> attack
structural reinforcement of the ruin and some reconstruction work began in the early <num> century including restoration of the east gable rose window in <year> and the replacement of the missing form pieces mullions and decorative ribs in the window in the north @-@ east wall of the chapterhouse fig
<num>
by <year> repointing the walls and additional waterproofing of the wall tops were completed
in <year> the ground level was lowered and the <num> century tomb of the earl of huntly was repositioned
further repairs and restoration ensued during the <num> including the partial dismantling of some <num> century buttressing fig
<num> the reconstruction of sections of the nave piers using recovered pieces fig
<num> and the addition of external roofing to the vault in the south choir in <year> fig

from <year> to <year> masons restored the cathedral 's crumbling stonework fig
<num> and between <year> and <year> the window tracery of the chapterhouse was gradually replaced and its re @-@ roofing was completed fig

a seventh unused bell dates from <year> and has been noted as being of historical importance by the church buildings council of the church of england
the parish registers begin in <year> and the churchwardens accounts in <year>
a large room was added to the rear in <year> and in <year> the building was restored and presented to the parish by lord stanley
it is now used as a parish hall and is listed grade ii
the medieval church cross in the churchyard the stanley mausoleum and the churchyard walls gate piers and gates are grade ii listed
the mausoleum was built in <year> by edward lyulph <num> lord stanley
he died in <year> and it contains his ashes and those of his wife mary katherine who died in <year>
the mausoleum is built in ashlar buff and red sandstone with a kerridge stone @-@ slate roof
it was designed in the neo @-@ jacobean style by paul phipps and is rectangular in shape with two storeys and a three @-@ bay north front
the central bay contains a door above which is the stanley crest a three @-@ light window and a date plaque in the gable
on the sides of the upper storey are three four @-@ light windows
inside the mausoleum is a white marble sarcophagus
the yew tree in the churchyard is <num> @,@ <num> years old
a stone slab was removed exposing steps leading to a crypt under the chancel
this contained six coffins four of which contained the bodies of the first and second lords stanley and their wives
once the details had been recorded the crypt was resealed
the church is open to visitors at advertised times and guided tours are available
a parish magazine is published monthly
it is found widely along coastlines in the indo @-@ pacific preferring reefs sandy flats and seagrass beds from very shallow water to a depth of <num> m <num> ft
with a cylindrical body and a broad flattened head the tawny nurse shark is quite similar in appearance to the nurse shark ginglymostoma cirratum of the atlantic and east pacific from which it can be distinguished by its pointed @-@ tipped dorsal fins and narrow sickle @-@ shaped pectoral fins
the maximum recorded length of the tawny nurse shark is <num>
<num> m <num> ft
nocturnal in habits the tawny nurse shark tends to spend the day resting in piles of two dozen or more individuals inside caves or under ledges
at night it is an active @-@ swimming predator that uses a powerful suction force to extract prey from inside holes and crevices
the diet of this species consists mainly of octopus though they also take other invertebrates small bony fishes and rarely sea snakes
it is aplacental viviparous meaning the embryos hatch from egg capsules inside the mother
it is the only carpet shark in which the embryos are oophagous feeding on eggs produced by the mother while inside the uterus
the litter size may be as small as one or two based on the large size of near @-@ term embryos
compared to the nurse shark the tawny nurse shark has a more placid disposition and will often allow divers to touch and play with it
however it should be accorded respect due to its powerful jaws and sharp teeth
this species is caught by commercial fisheries across most of its range for meat fins liver oil leather and fishmeal
it is also esteemed as a game fish off queensland australia and is known for its habit of spitting water in the faces of its captors
the international union for conservation of nature iucn has assessed the tawny nurse shark as vulnerable with subpopulations in several areas already diminished or extirpated
<num> m <num> ft <num> in long specimen from new guinea
his short account was published in <year> in voyage au tour du monde sur la corvette la coquille
a more detailed description along with an illustration was published by german naturalist eduard rüppell in <year> as nebrius concolor based on a specimen from the red sea
both names were retained often in separate genera ginglymostoma and nebrius respectively until they were synonymized by leonard compagno in <year>
compagno recognized that the tooth shape differences used to separate these species were the result of differences in age with n
concolor representing younger individuals
the genus name nebrius is derived from the greek word nebris or nebridos meaning the skin of a fawn
the specific epithet ferrugineus is latin for rust @-@ colored
other common names for this species include giant sleepy shark madame x a name coined by the shark fisherman norman caldwell in the <num> for the then @-@ unidentified australian specimens nurse shark rusty catshark rusty shark sleepy shark spitting shark and tawny shark
based on morphological similarities nebrius is believed to be the sister genus of ginglymostoma with both being placed in a clade that also contains the short @-@ tail nurse shark pseudoginglymostoma brevicaudatum the whale shark rhincodon typus and the zebra shark stegostoma fasciatum
in the indian ocean it is found from kwazulu @-@ natal south africa northward to the red sea persian gulf and india including madagascar mauritius the chagos archipelago the seychelles and the maldives
in the western pacific it occurs from southern japan and the coast of china to the philippines southeast asia and indonesia to as far south as the northern coast of australia
in the central pacific it has been reported from off new caledonia samoa palau the marshall islands and tahiti
fossil teeth belonging to this species have been found in the pirabas formation of northern brazil dating back to the lower miocene <num> – <num> ma
the presence of these fossils indicates that the range of the tawny nurse shark once extended to the tropical atlantic ocean prior to the formation of the isthmus of panama
an inshore species the tawny nurse shark inhabits continental and insular shelves over sandy flats or beds of seagrass as well as along the outer edges of coral or rocky reefs
this shark may be found from the surf zone often in water barely deep enough to cover its body to a maximum depth of <num> m <num> ft on coral reefs it is most common at a depth of <num> – <num> m <num> – <num> ft
young sharks are generally found in the shallow areas of lagoons while adults may be encountered across a variety of habitats
<num> m <num> ft
it has a robust cylindrical body with a broadly rounded and flattened head
the eyes are small and face laterally with prominent ridges over them and smaller spiracles behind
there are a pair of long slender barbels in front of the nostrils
the mouth is small with the lower lip divided into three lobes
there are <num> – <num> tooth rows in the upper jaw and <num> – <num> tooth rows in the lower jaw arranged in an imbricate overlapping pattern with the outermost <num> – <num> functional rows separated from the rest by a narrow space
each tooth resembles a fan with a broad base rising to a small sharp central point flanked by <num> or more smaller cusps on both sides
as the shark ages the teeth become relatively taller and thicker
the fourth and fifth pairs of gill slits are placed much closer together than the others
the dorsal and pelvic fins are angular with the first dorsal fin larger than the second
the pectoral fins are narrow pointed and falcate sickle @-@ shaped their shape separates this species from the similar @-@ looking nurse shark
the origin of the first dorsal fin is about even with the origin of the pelvic fins while the origin of the anal fin is even with or somewhat behind the origin of the second dorsal fin
the caudal fin has a shallow upper lobe and barely present lower lobe comprising about a quarter of the total length in adults
the dermal denticles are diamond @-@ shaped bearing <num> – <num> faint ridges radiating from a blunt point
tawny nurse sharks are yellowish reddish or grayish brown above and off @-@ white below and are capable of slowly changing their color to better blend with the environment
young sharks have starkly white lower eyelids
many tawny nurse sharks found off the coasts of japan taiwan and the ryukyu islands lack a second dorsal fin
this physical abnormality has been speculated to result from pregnant females being exposed to water of unusually high salinity and or temperature possibly from human activity
in <year> a <num>
<num> m <num> ft <num> in long adult male with both a missing dorsal fin and partial albinism in the form of white body color with gray @-@ brown eyes was captured off wakayama prefecture japan
this anomalous individual is the largest albino shark known to date having survived for a long time in the wild despite its lack of camouflage
the characteristics of its body head fins and teeth are comparable to other active reef sharks sharing its range such as the sicklefin lemon shark negaprion acutidens
tawny nurse sharks are primarily nocturnal though they are said to be active at all hours off madagascar and in captivity they will become diurnally active if presented with food
during the day groups of two dozen or more sharks can be found resting inside caves and under ledges often stacked atop one another
individual sharks have small home ranges that they consistently return to each day
the tawny nurse shark has few natural predators attacks on this species have been reported from bull sharks carcharhinus leucas and great hammerheads sphyrna mokarran while the related nurse shark has been known to fall prey to tiger sharks galeocerdo cuvier and lemon sharks negaprion brevirostris
known parasites of this species include five species of tapeworms in the genus pedibothrium which infest the shark 's spiral intestine
other known food items include corals sea urchins crustaceans e
g
crabs and lobsters squid small fishes e
g
surgeonfish queenfish and rabbitfish and the occasional sea snake
hunting tawny nurse sharks swim slowly just above the sea floor poking their heads into depressions and holes
when a prey item is found the shark forcefully expands its large muscular pharynx creating a powerful negative pressure that sucks the prey into its mouth
adult females have one functional ovary and two functional uteruses
the mode of reproduction is aplacental viviparity meaning that the embryos hatch inside the uterus females in captivity have been documented depositing up to <num> non @-@ viable egg capsules which has led to erroneous reports of this shark being oviparous
the egg capsules of this species are onion @-@ shaped with thin brown translucent shells
the tawny nurse shark is the only carpet shark in which there is oophagy once the developing embryos exhaust their supply of yolk they gorge on eggs produced by the mother and acquire the distended abdomen characteristic of such oophagous embryos
unlike in mackerel sharks the eggs consumed by the embryos are large and shelled rather than small and undeveloped
there is no evidence of sibling cannibalism as in the sand tiger shark carcharias taurus
various authors have reported the length at birth anywhere from <num> to <num> cm <num> to <num> in with the discrepancy possibly reflecting geographic variation
although females release up to four fertilized eggs into each uterus the very large size of the newborns suggest that the litter size may be as few as one or two
in one examined female that had two embryos sharing a single uterus one embryo was much smaller and thinner than the other implying that competition may eliminate the additional siblings
males attain sexual maturity at a length of <num>
<num> m <num> ft <num> in and females at a length of <num>
<num> – <num>
<num> m <num> ft <num> in – <num> ft <num> in
however this species has been infrequently provoked into biting and merits respect due to its strength small but sharp teeth and extremely powerful jaws
tawny nurse sharks are favored attractions for ecotourist divers off thailand the solomon islands and elsewhere
this species also adapts well to captivity and is displayed in public aquaria in europe the united states okinawa and singapore where they may become tame enough to be hand @-@ fed
the tawny nurse shark is taken by commercial fisheries operating throughout its range including off pakistan india thailand and the philippines an exception is in australian waters where it is only taken in small numbers as bycatch
this shark is caught using demersal trawls floating and fixed bottom gill nets and on hook @-@ and @-@ line
the meat is sold fresh or dried and salted the fins are used for shark fin soup and the offal processed into fishmeal
in addition the liver is a source of oil and vitamins and the thick tough skin is made into leather products
off queensland australia the tawny nurse shark is valued by big @-@ game anglers
when hooked large individuals are tenacious opponents and are difficult to subdue due to their habit of spinning
they are also capable of spitting a powerful jet of water into the faces of their captors making grunting noises in between jets making the tawny shark one of the few species of sharks to produce a noise whether this is a deliberate defensive behavior is uncertain
the international union for conservation of nature iucn has assessed the tawny nurse shark as vulnerable worldwide as it faces heavy fishing pressure and its low reproductive and dispersal rates limit the ability of over @-@ exploited populations to recover
furthermore this shark 's inshore habitat renders it susceptible to habitat degradation destructive fishing practices e
g
poisons and explosives especially prevalent off indonesia and the philippines and human harassment
localized declines or extirpations of the tawny nurse shark have been documented off india and thailand
off australia this species has been assessed as of least concern as there it is not targeted by fisheries

formed by kim deal in <year> after her band the breeders went on hiatus the group consisted of deal vocals and guitars luis lerma bass nate farley guitars and the breeders jim macpherson drums
the breeders kelley deal kim 's sister was also briefly involved but had to leave the band due to drug problems
the group was named when kim deal started calling herself tammy ampersand for fun and the band tammy and the amps
they recorded the album pacer in ireland and the united states
pacer was released in october <year>
the group toured the united states europe and australia with bands including the foo fighters sonic youth and guided by voices
critics commented on the loose and rough quality of these performances
the amps continued as a group until <year> when deal changed their name back to the breeders
by <year> macpherson lerma and farley had left the band they were all at times involved in various projects with guided by voices robert pollard
deal 's next album the breeders title tk was released seven years after pacer
in august <year> the breeders released their second album last splash which went platinum in the usa gold in canada and silver in the uk
the other members of the group at that time were kim 's twin sister kelley deal josephine wiggs and jim macpherson
by late <year> after two years of straight touring and recording and culminating in the lollapalooza tour the band members were exhausted they decided to take some time off from the breeders but this hiatus ended up being longer than expected
kelley was arrested on drug charges in late <year> and spent time in and out of rehabilitation while wiggs became involved in musical projects in new york including collaborations with members of luscious jackson
meanwhile kim deal was eager to continue recording and performing
at first she envisioned her next album as a solo record on which she would play all of the instrument parts
when she was recording initial demos for the project she asked kelley to play on some of them to distract her from her drug difficulties
since kelley was now also involved deal decided not to go solo but formed a new group
she recruited macpherson to play drums musician luis lerma bass and nate farley guitar
later kelley dropped out of the project for rehabilitation and moved to saint paul minnesota
for fun deal began calling herself tammy ampersand and the group tammy and the amps
this later became simply the amps
the first session at easley studios in memphis tennessee was engineered by davis mccain and doug easley
there deal recorded new songs including what would become pacer 's single tipp city
this recording opportunity came about when she was producing a planned record by guided by voices when that group abandoned work on their album deal used the leftover studio time for her own songs
following the easley studios session recording for pacer continued at six other locations in total including studios in chicago los angeles dublin and deal 's hometown dayton ohio
engineers steve albini john agnello bryce goggin and others each helped record one or more of these sessions
pacer came out in october <year>
the amps toured throughout <year> and <year>
early performances before releasing pacer included june <year> shows in dayton one with poster children and another with guided by voices
they toured with guided by voices and chavez in the united kingdom in september in cities such as london glasgow and sheffield and played another show with guided by voices in ohio in october
the amps performed a series of us concerts in october and november with sonic youth including shows in detroit and chicago with helium in seattle and portland with bikini kill and in los angeles with mike watt
following the concerts with sonic youth the amps did a tour of europe
in january <year> they played the summersault festival in australia
that year the amps toured with the foo fighters in the united states in locations such as chicago with that dog worcester massachusetts and austin texas with jawbreaker
in <year> or <year> they also played shows with the tasties and brainiac
reviewers described live concerts by the amps as unpolished and relaxed
the chronicle 's drema crist praised their show at an unidentified location as fun @-@ spirited and silly
greg kot of the chicago tribune described one of their chicago performances as off @-@ kilter and wrote that deal 's pungent vocals were swallowed up by the guitars and the foursome 's slight melodies were lost amid all the bashing
a review in the chicago reader of the same concert noted that the amps play with a low @-@ key hangout sound
the phoenix 's matt ashare felt that at their december <year> show in boston the amps didn 't click in a way that would suggest that this was deal 's new full @-@ time band he added that it was an unpretentiously gritty way for deal to let off some steam while the breeders took a little break
in boston rock this concert was characterized as sloppy but charm ing
hanging loosely off kim 's gruff vocals and ebullient personality
until then deal had been waiting for wiggs and kelley to rejoin the breeders and record a new album together and had held back from reforming the breeders out of respect for them
in may <year> wiggs revealed that she would not be involved in any immediate breeders activity kelley also chose to stay in saint paul to be close to her rehabilitation facility
deal then decided that she did not want to wait any longer to reform the group partly because the breeders repertoire was larger than the amps thereby allowing longer concerts
deal added violinist carrie bradley who had played on the breeders pod album and with macpherson lerma and farley played some shows in <year> with primus
by <year> kelley had rejoined and macpherson had left the group and by <year> lerma and farley had also left
the breeders with a line @-@ up including the deal sisters and new members mando lopez and jose medeles released the albums title tk in <year> and mountain battles in <year>
meanwhile macpherson was a member of guided by voices from <year> to <year> and participated in other projects with guided by voices robert pollard until <year>
lerma and farley have been members of the tasties and in <year> participated in pollard 's lexo and the leapers side project group farley was also a member of guided by voices from <year> to <year>
in <year> the last splash @-@ era breeders line @-@ up of kim and kelley deal macpherson and wiggs reunited to tour to celebrate the <num> anniversary of that album
it began with the arrival of pioneer <num> into the jovian system in <year> and as of <year> has continued with eight further spacecraft missions
all of these missions were undertaken by the national aeronautics and space administration nasa and all but two have been flybys that take detailed observations without the probe landing or entering orbit
these probes make jupiter the most visited of the solar system 's outer planets as all missions to the outer solar system have used jupiter flybys to reduce fuel requirements and travel time
on <num> july <year> spacecraft juno arrived and entered the planet 's orbit — the second craft ever to do so
sending a craft to jupiter entails many technical difficulties especially due to the probes large fuel requirements and the effects of the planet 's harsh radiation environment
the first spacecraft to visit jupiter was pioneer <num> in <year> followed a year later by pioneer <num>
aside from taking the first close @-@ up pictures of the planet the probes discovered its magnetosphere and its largely fluid interior
the voyager <num> and voyager <num> probes visited the planet in <year> and studied its moons and the ring system discovering the volcanic activity of io and the presence of water ice on the surface of europa
ulysses further studied jupiter 's magnetosphere in <year> and then again in <year>
the cassini probe approached the planet in <year> and took very detailed images of its atmosphere
the new horizons spacecraft passed by jupiter in <year> and made improved measurements of its and its satellites parameters
the galileo spacecraft was the first to have entered orbit around jupiter arriving in <year> and studying the planet until <year>
during this period galileo gathered a large amount of information about the jovian system making close approaches to all of the four large galilean moons and finding evidence for thin atmospheres on three of them as well as the possibility of liquid water beneath their surfaces
it also discovered a magnetic field around ganymede
as it approached jupiter it also witnessed the impact of comet shoemaker – levy <num>
in december <year> it sent an atmospheric probe into the jovian atmosphere so far the only craft to do so
in july <year> the juno spacecraft launched in <year> completed its orbital insertion maneuver successfully and is now in orbit around jupiter and preparing for its science programme
the european space agency selected the l1 @-@ class juice mission in <year> as part of its cosmic vision programme to explore three of jupiter 's galilean moons with a possible ganymede lander provided by roscosmos
juice is proposed to be launched in <year>
it requires almost the same amount of energy for a spacecraft to reach jupiter from earth 's orbit as it does to lift it into orbit in the first place
in astrodynamics this energy expenditure is defined by the net change in the spacecraft 's velocity or delta @-@ v
the energy needed to reach jupiter from an earth orbit requires a delta @-@ v of about <num> km s compared to the <num>
<num> – <num>
<num> km s to reach a low earth orbit from the ground
gravity assists through planetary flybys such as by earth or venus can be used to reduce the energetic requirement i
e
the fuel at launch at the cost of a significantly longer flight duration to reach a target such as jupiter when compared to the direct trajectory
ion thrusters capable of a delta @-@ v of more than <num> kilometers s were used on the dawn spacecraft
this is more than enough delta @-@ v to do a jupiter fly @-@ by mission from a solar orbit of the same radius as that of earth without gravity assist
a major problem in sending space probes to jupiter is that the planet has no solid surface on which to land as there is a smooth transition between the planet 's atmosphere and its fluid interior
any probes descending into the atmosphere are eventually crushed by the immense pressures within jupiter
another major issue is the amount of radiation to which a space probe is subjected due to the harsh charged @-@ particle environment around jupiter for a detailed explanation see magnetosphere of jupiter
for example when pioneer <num> made its closest approach to the planet the level of radiation was ten times more powerful than pioneer 's designers had predicted leading to fears that the probes would not survive
with a few minor glitches the probe managed to pass through the radiation belts but it lost most of the images of the moon io as the radiation had caused pioneer 's imaging photo polarimeter to receive false commands
the subsequent and far more technologically advanced voyager spacecraft had to be redesigned to cope with the radiation levels
over the eight years the galileo spacecraft orbited the planet the probe 's radiation dose far exceeded its design specifications and its systems failed on several occasions
the spacecraft 's gyroscopes often exhibited increased errors and electrical arcs sometimes occurred between its rotating and non @-@ rotating parts causing it to enter safe mode which led to total loss of the data from the <num> <num> and <num> orbits
the radiation also caused phase shifts in galileo 's ultra @-@ stable quartz oscillator
pioneer <num> obtained the first @-@ ever close @-@ up images of jupiter and its galilean moons the spacecraft studied the planet 's atmosphere detected its magnetic field observed its radiation belts and determined that jupiter is mainly fluid
pioneer <num> made its closest approach within some <num> @,@ <num> km of jupiter 's cloud tops on december <num> <year>
it obtained dramatic images of the great red spot made the first observation of jupiter 's immense polar regions and determined the mass of jupiter 's moon callisto
the information gathered by these two spacecraft helped astronomers and engineers improve the design of future probes to cope more effectively with the environment around the giant planet
this close approach allowed for greater image resolution though the flyby 's short duration meant that most observations of jupiter 's moons rings magnetic field and radiation environment were made in the <num> @-@ hour period bracketing the approach even though voyager <num> continued photographing the planet until april
it was soon followed by voyager <num> which made its closest approach on july <num> <year> <num> @,@ <num> km away from the planet 's cloud tops
the probe discovered jupiter 's ring observed intricate vortices in its atmosphere observed active volcanoes on io a process analogous to plate tectonics on ganymede and numerous craters on callisto
the voyager missions vastly improved our understanding of the galilean moons and also discovered jupiter 's rings
they also took the first close @-@ up images of the planet 's atmosphere revealing the great red spot as a complex storm moving in a counter @-@ clockwise direction
other smaller storms and eddies were found throughout the banded clouds see animation on the right
two new small satellites adrastea and metis were discovered orbiting just outside the ring making them the first of jupiter 's moons to be identified by a spacecraft
a third new satellite thebe was discovered between the orbits of amalthea and io
the discovery of volcanic activity on the moon io was the greatest unexpected finding of the mission as it was the first time an active volcano was observed on a celestial body other than earth
together the voyagers recorded the eruption of nine volcanoes on io as well as evidence for other eruptions occurring between the voyager encounters
europa displayed a large number of intersecting linear features in the low @-@ resolution photos from voyager <num>
at first scientists believed the features might be deep cracks caused by crustal rifting or tectonic processes
the high @-@ resolution photos from voyager <num> taken closer to jupiter left scientists puzzled as the features in these photos were almost entirely lacking in topographic relief
this led many to suggest that these cracks might be similar to ice floes on earth and that europa might have a liquid water interior
europa may be internally active due to tidal heating at a level about one @-@ tenth that of io and as a result the moon is thought to have a thin crust less than <num> kilometers <num> mi thick of water ice possibly floating on a <num> @-@ kilometers @-@ deep <num> mile ocean
this swing @-@ by maneuver was required for ulysses to attain a very high @-@ inclination orbit around the sun increasing its inclination to the ecliptic to <num>
<num> degrees
the giant planet 's gravity bent the spacecraft 's flightpath downward and away from the ecliptic plane placing it into a final orbit around the sun 's north and south poles
the size and shape of the probe 's orbit were adjusted to a much smaller degree so that its aphelion remained at approximately <num> au jupiter 's distance from the sun while its perihelion lay somewhat beyond <num> au earth 's distance from the sun
during its jupiter encounter the probe made measurements of the planet 's magnetosphere
since the probe had no cameras no images were taken
in february <year> the probe arrived again at the vicinity of jupiter
this time the distance from the planet was much greater — about <num> million km — but it made further observations of jupiter
it made its closest approach on december <num> <year> and made many scientific measurements
about <num> @,@ <num> images of jupiter were taken during the months @-@ long flyby
it produced the most detailed global color portrait of jupiter yet in which the smallest visible features are approximately <num> km <num> mi across
a major finding of the flyby announced on march <num> <year> was of jupiter 's atmospheric circulation
dark belts alternate with light zones in the atmosphere and the zones with their pale clouds had previously been considered by scientists to be areas of upwelling air partly because on earth clouds tend to be formed by rising air
analysis of cassini imagery showed that the dark belts contain individual storm cells of upwelling bright @-@ white clouds too small to see from earth
anthony del genio of nasa 's goddard institute for space studies said that the belts must be the areas of net @-@ rising atmospheric motion on jupiter so the net motion in the zones has to be sinking
other atmospheric observations included a swirling dark oval of high atmospheric @-@ haze about the size of the great red spot near jupiter 's north pole
infrared imagery revealed aspects of circulation near the poles with bands of globe @-@ encircling winds and adjacent bands moving in opposite directions
the same announcement also discussed the nature of jupiter 's rings
light scattering by particles in the rings showed the particles were irregularly shaped rather than spherical and likely originated as ejecta from micrometeorite impacts on jupiter 's moons probably on metis and adrastea
on december <num> <year> the cassini spacecraft captured a very @-@ low @-@ resolution image of the moon himalia but it was too distant to show any surface details
its long range reconnaissance imager lorri took its first photographs of jupiter on september <num> <year>
the spacecraft began further study of the jovian system in december <year> and made its closest approach on february <num> <year>
although close to jupiter new horizons instruments made refined measurements of the orbits of jupiter 's inner moons particularly amalthea
the probe 's cameras measured volcanoes on io studied all four galilean moons in detail and made long @-@ distance studies of the outer moons himalia and elara
the craft also studied jupiter 's little red spot and the planet 's magnetosphere and tenuous ring system
on march <num> <year> the command and data handling computer experienced an uncorrectable memory error and rebooted itself causing the spacecraft to go into safe mode
the craft fully recovered within two days with some data loss on jupiter 's magnetotail
no other data loss events were associated with the encounter
due to the immense size of the jupiter system and the relative closeness of the jovian system to earth in comparison to the closeness of pluto to earth new horizons will send back more data to earth from the jupiter encounter than the pluto encounter
it orbited the planet for over seven years making <num> orbits before it was destroyed during a controlled impact with jupiter on september <num> <year>
during this period it gathered a large amount of information about the jovian system the amount of information was not as great as intended because the deployment of its high @-@ gain radio transmitting antenna failed
the major events during the eight @-@ year study included multiple flybys of all of the galilean moons as well as amalthea the first probe to do so
it also witnessed the impact of comet shoemaker – levy <num> as it approached jupiter in <year> and the sending of an atmospheric probe into the jovian atmosphere in december <year>
cameras on the galileo spacecraft observed fragments of comet shoemaker – levy <num> between <num> and <num> july <year> as they collided with jupiter 's southern hemisphere at a speed of approximately <num> kilometres per second
this was the first direct observation of an extraterrestrial collision of solar system objects
while the impacts took place on the side of jupiter hidden from earth galileo then at a distance of <num>
<num> au from the planet was able to see the impacts as they occurred
its instruments detected a fireball that reached a peak temperature of about <num> @,@ <num> k compared to the typical jovian cloudtop temperature of about <num> k − <num> ° c with the plume from the fireball reaching a height of over <num> @,@ <num> km
an atmospheric probe was released from the spacecraft in july <year> entering the planet 's atmosphere on december <num> <year>
after a high @-@ g descent into the jovian atmosphere the probe discarded the remains of its heat shield and it parachuted through <num> km of the atmosphere collecting data for <num>
<num> minutes before being crushed by the pressure and temperature to which it was subjected about <num> times earth normal at a temperature of <num> ° c
it would have melted thereafter and possibly vaporized
the galileo orbiter itself experienced a more rapid version of the same fate when it was deliberately steered into the planet on september <num> <year> at a speed of over <num> km s in order to avoid any possibility of it crashing into and contaminating europa
major scientific results of the galileo mission include the first observation of ammonia clouds in another planet 's atmosphere — the atmosphere creates ammonia ice particles from material coming up from lower depths confirmation of extensive volcanic activity on io — which is <num> times greater than that found on earth the heat and frequency of eruptions are reminiscent of early earth observation of complex plasma interactions in io 's atmosphere which create immense electrical currents that couple to jupiter 's atmosphere providing evidence for supporting the theory that liquid oceans exist under europa 's icy surface first detection of a substantial magnetic field around a satellite ganymede magnetic data evidence suggesting that europa ganymede and callisto have a liquid @-@ saltwater layer under the visible surface evidence for a thin atmospheric layer on europa ganymede and callisto known as a surface @-@ bound exosphere understanding of the formation of the rings of jupiter by dust kicked up as interplanetary meteoroids which smash into the planet 's four small inner moons and observation of two outer rings and the possibility of a separate ring along amalthea 's orbit identification of the global structure and dynamics of a giant planet 's magnetosphere
on december <num> <year> nasa reported based on results from the galileo mission the detection of clay @-@ like minerals specifically phyllosilicates often associated with organic materials on the icy crust of europa moon of jupiter
the presence of the minerals may have been the result of a collision with an asteroid or comet according to the scientists
the spacecraft will be placed in a polar orbit to study the planet 's composition gravity field magnetic field and polar magnetosphere
juno will also search for clues about how jupiter formed including whether the planet has a rocky core the amount of water present within the deep atmosphere and how the mass is distributed within the planet
juno will also study jupiter 's deep winds which can reach speeds of <num> km h
juno started orbiting jupiter on the night of <num> july <year>
it is expected to launch in <year> and after a series of flybys in the inner solar system arrive in <year>
in <year> the european space agency 's selected the jupiter icy moon explorer juice as its first large mission replacing its contribution to ejsm the jupiter ganymede orbiter jgo
the partnership for the europa jupiter system mission has since ended but nasa will continue to contribute the european mission with hardware and an instrument
in march <year> funds were authorized for pre @-@ formulation and or formulation activities for a mission that meets the science goals outlined for the jupiter europa mission in the most recent planetary decadal survey
the proposed mission would be set to launch in the early <num> and reach europa after a <num>
<num> year cruise
the spacecraft would fly by the moon <num> times to minimize radiation damage
funding difficulties have delayed progress
the europa orbiter was a planned nasa mission to europa which was canceled in <year>
its main objectives included determining the presence or absence of a subsurface ocean and identifying candidate sites for future lander missions
nasa 's jimo jupiter icy moons orbiter which was canceled in <year> and a european jovian europa orbiter mission were also studied but were superseded by the europa jupiter system mission
the europa jupiter system mission ejsm was a joint nasa esa proposal for exploration of jupiter and its moons
in february <year> it was announced that both space agencies had given this mission priority ahead of the titan saturn system mission
the proposal included a launch date of around <year> and consists of the nasa @-@ led jupiter europa orbiter and the esa @-@ led jupiter ganymede orbiter
esa 's contribution had encountered funding competition from other esa projects
however the jupiter europa orbiter jeo nasa 's contribution was considered by the planetary decadal survey to be too expensive
the survey supported a cheaper alternative to jeo
particular targets are europa due to its potential for life and callisto due to its relatively low radiation dose
in <year> nasa proposed a program called human outer planets exploration hope that involved sending astronauts to explore the galilean moons
nasa has projected a possible attempt some time in the <num>
in the vision for space exploration policy announced in january <year> nasa discussed missions beyond mars mentioning that a human research presence may be desirable on jupiter 's moons
before the jimo mission was cancelled nasa administrator sean o 'keefe stated that human explorers will follow
factories stationed in orbit could mine the gas and deliver it to visiting craft
however the jovian system in general poses particular disadvantages for colonization because of the severe radiation conditions prevailing in jupiter 's magnetosphere and the planet 's particularly deep gravitational well
jupiter would deliver about <num> sv <num> rem per day to unshielded colonists at io and about <num>
<num> sv <num> rems per day to unshielded colonists at europa which is a decisive aspect due to the fact that already an exposure to about <num>
<num> sv over a period of a few days is enough to cause radiation poisoning and about <num> sv over a few days is fatal
ganymede is the solar system 's largest moon and the solar system 's only known moon with a magnetosphere but this does not shield it from cosmic radiation to a noteworthy degree because it is overshadowed by jupiter 's magnetic field
ganymede receives about <num>
<num> sv <num> rem of radiation per day
callisto is farther from jupiter 's strong radiation belt and subject to only <num>
<num> sv <num>
<num> rem a day
for comparison the average amount of radiation taken on earth by a living organism is about <num>
<num> sv per year the highest natural radiation levels on earth are recorded around ramsar hot springs at about <num>
<num> sv per year
one of the main targets chosen by the hope study was callisto
the possibility of building a surface base on callisto was proposed because of the low radiation levels at its distance from jupiter and its geological stability
callisto is the only galilean satellite for which human exploration is feasible
the levels of ionizing radiation on io europa and ganymede are hostile to human life and adequate protective measures have yet to be devised
it could be possible to build a surface base that would produce fuel for further exploration of the solar system
in <year> the artemis project designed a plan to colonize europa
according to this plan explorers would drill down into the europan ice crust entering the postulated subsurface ocean where they would inhabit artificial air pockets
the fort was built after more than <num> years of indecision over the defence of south australia
it was the first colonial fortification in the state and is the best preserved and most functional in australia
fort glanville was designed by governor major general sir william jervois and lieutenant colonel peter scratchley both important figures in early australian colonial defence
when built it was designed to defend both semaphore 's anchorage and shipping entering the port river from naval attack
construction of the fort began in <year>
it was officially opened in october <year> and completed by <year>
due to changes in the port river and shipping movements fort largs surpassed it for strategic importance by <year>
by the close of the <num> century the fort was largely unused and had no defence significance
it was briefly used for military purposes during world war i and world war ii though not for its original defensive role
for much of the <num> century the area was put to a variety of uses including accommodation a caravan park and a boy scout campsite
after coming into state government hands in <year> it was declared as a conservation park and is now managed by the department of environment water and natural resources dewnr preserving and showcasing its historic value
the fort and surrounds occupy the northern half of the <num> @-@ hectare <num> @-@ acre conservation park the southern half is a caravan park
the fort is a lunette shaped defensible battery that was supported by land forces for self @-@ defence
when constructed it was seen as state of the art incorporating powerful and modern weapons
its main armament is two rifled muzzle @-@ loading rml <num> inch <num> ton guns backed up by two rml <num> pounder <num> cwt guns both rare in their particular configuration
the fort retains its original <num> century cannons and three have been restored to working condition
fort glanville historical association operates the park under license and conducts open days in the park recreating the past operation of the fort including military drill and the firing of period weapons
the association park service other volunteers and various grants have all helped ensure the fort is presented in close to original condition
it is the most complete <num> century fort in australia and one of very few in the world that remains in original condition
connecting the fort to semaphore jetty is the semaphore and fort glanville tourist railway a <num> mm <num>
<num> in gauge passenger steam train operated by volunteers from the national railway museum
communication lines were long and the empire 's wars remote
great britain had undisputed military predominance and she was expected by all to protect her colonies even one as distant
for local defence governor gawler raised the first military force in <year> composed solely of volunteers and known as the south australian volunteer militia brigade
it was granted the royal title in <year> but the brigade had all but ceased to exist a year later
the colony obtained its first artillery in <year> with the arrival of six field guns of various types
tensions between britain and the russian empire in the <num> as starkly demonstrated by the crimean war along with australia @-@ wide moves towards self @-@ government caused a reassessment of the colony 's defence posture
the various colonies regarded themselves as possible targets for the russian pacific fleet then based in siberia
in <year> governor henry young appointed a commission under boyle travers finniss to report on the defence of the colony in case of war
boyle 's report recommended leaving strategic defence in the hands of the imperial navy though south australia was to purchase a <num> ton naval vessel
local defence was to be largely handled by the existing small imperial garrison and local colonial force supported by the artillery obtained in <year>
when the crimean war ended in <year> the danger passed and the perceived need for expensive defence preparations with it
for many years nothing substantive came about from debate on defence of the colony
over time there formed a consensus favouring semaphore for fixed defences or fortification a strategy also argued by the government established hart commission in <year>
raiders were seen as unlikely to force the shallows of the port river but instead were expected to stand off semaphore shell the port and use their guns to support landings
the hart report recommended building of martello towers at semaphore and glenelg the first report to recommend permanent fortification at semaphore though none were built mainly due to the cost
the volunteer military force was revived in <year> with new and modern arms for the infantry cavalry and artillery
though there was a few years of enthusiasm and a restructuring in <year> by <year> the force was virtually disbanded
in that year also british troops were withdrawn from the other australian colonies none were by then stationed in south australia
with no definitive defence policy in <year> the government had sought advice from captain parkin of hms falcon and commodore sir william wiseman commander of the australian station both visiting british naval officers
they both recommended fixed fortifications for the coast supported by gunboats
sir wiseman 's report particularly recommended construction of forts at semaphore port creek 's entrance and one midway between
in <year> a story circulated supported by press speculation that there was a danger of the russian fleet attacking melbourne should russia and britain find themselves at war
the south australian register produced an editorial decrying the states lack of defences
within days £ <num> @,@ <num> a <num>
<num> million in <year> was provided by the government for defence an amount then seen as insufficient for significant preparation
the danger passed without any lasting defence action except the government 's in @-@ principle adoption of sir wiseman 's recommendations
to curtail costs only the semaphore fort was to be built initially as it was considered the most critical
site preparation begun and two <num> @-@ inch <num> mm guns were purchased but escalating cost estimates caused the plan to be abandoned by <year>
during the early <num> south australia 's defence was solely dependent on the volunteer military and a few artillery pieces purchased during earlier war scares
british troops had been withdrawn from the australian colonies in <year> leaving the state dependent on its own military resources
in a report to the government in <year> colonel freeling and major peter scratchley recommended establishment of a permanent military force
in <year> the south australian government along with those from new south wales victoria and queensland requested from the war office that major general sir william jervois a noted coastal fortification expert be appointed to advise on defence needs
he arrived in sydney in mid @-@ <year> with then lieutenant colonel scratchley
the <year> report delivered after he became south australian governor called for three batteries at largs bay semaphore and glenelg connected by a military road and supported by field gun emplacements naval elements and mobile forces
he determined that south australia 's most probable defence risk was an attack by up to two ships rather than a larger force and this formed the basis of the final fortification design
his report called for military road to be extended to marino an electro @-@ contact torpedo station be established on torrens island and that a gun boat be provided
in november <year> the government passed the military forces act which provided for the raising of a permanent military force and reserve
two volunteer reserve rifle companies were formed in <year> and a permanent artillery unit in <year>
at this time semaphore with its jetty built in <year> was the state 's main entry point for passengers and mail
it had a signal station built <year> and a time ball tower built <year>
semaphore remained of great maritime significance for the state until the <num>
when the decision was made to build the fort in <year> the state 's population had reached approximately <num> @,@ <num>
settlement extended beyond port augusta though adelaide remained the dominant feature in the economy partly due to the layout of the rail network
at this point adelaide had a population of over <num> @,@ <num>
port adelaide was the main port for south australia with over <num> ships visiting each year and a local population of over <num> @,@ <num>
the first fort was erected to guard both the entrance to port adelaide and the anchorage at semaphore
it was built on sandhills near glanville hall at semaphore on a promontory called point malcom — a name that is now used for an adjacent reserve
the site was chosen so as to best guard shipping sailing to both the port river and the outer harbour and a second northern fort was to protect the entrance to port river itself
at the time of its construction it was seen as a defence against foreign threats mainly russian
scratchley had offered to design the battery the offer accepted by cabinet in january <year> and he was primarily responsible for the design of both fort glanville and fort largs
the plans were drawn by alexander bain moncrieff of the south australian engineer @-@ in @-@ chief 's department supervised by scratchley in his melbourne headquarters
moncrieff at scratchley 's suggestion was later to supervise the fort 's construction
plans for both batteries were completed in june <year> tenders called for in july and the contract for fort glanville awarded in august to john robb of kapunda south australia for the sum of £ <num> @,@ <num> <num> 7d
construction began in <year> and though completed by <year> the fort was operational in <year>
changes were made to the design during construction
some forced by armament changes and others made to ensure additional security including a rear @-@ defence wall and connecting road from military road
by january <year> two guns were in place and the fort opened later the same year with an extensive opening ceremony on <num> october
in addition to parades a small target was moored <num> @,@ <num> yards <num> @,@ <num> m offshore and fired on by all guns
a total of sixteen shots were fired during which one of the ten inch guns proved faulty
only one ranging shot was fired and the shots were estimated to land from on @-@ target to <num> yards short
the fort 's final cost was approximately £ <num> @,@ <num> a <num>
<num> million in <year> consisting of £ <num> @,@ <num> for physical structures and the remainder for armament and fittings
at the time of its construction it was at the forefront of such fortification design and was considered state of the art
when first conceived it was known as the semaphore battery later changed to south battery and then fort glanville by the opening ceremony
the name glanville came from nearby glanville hall residence of john hart <year> – <year> thrice premier of south australia
hart had named the house after his mother 's maiden name mary glanville
this changed in mid @-@ <year> when south australia 's first permanent military force was formed
the fort became the headquarters for the south australian permanent military force then the state 's entire standing army of one officer and eighteen other ranks
some of the unit was stationed at nearby fort largs from <year> and by <year> the unit had grown to one officer and <num> other ranks
this force grew to <num> of all ranks by <year> and was by then known as the permanent artillery
the unit trained <num> more non @-@ commissioned officers and men who were sent to man the king george sound batteries near albany western australia
though some of the gunners served in the second boer war the unit itself never saw action
fort glanville 's section was called out in <year> marching to assist the police with a waterside worker 's strike in port adelaide
in this case no shots were fired and the strikers did not confront the police or troops
additional defence acts were passed in <year> <year> and <year> but until defence passed into federal hands after <year> the state 's permanent military force was composed solely of artillery
shortly after the federation of australia a regiment of the royal australian artillery raa was formed and what had been the permanent artillery became no
<num> company raa
the fort was manned to an extent during world war i with one non @-@ commissioned officer and <num> gunners stationed as of november <year>
military reports and orders show the fort manned to at least mid @-@ <year> though at this point it is doubtful if the guns were fit to engage targets
there is little in the way of surviving personnel records from the fort 's active time
they may have either been destroyed or transferred to melbourne after federation
the fort 's record book shows it manned by a section of either the royal australian artillery or b company of the militia garrison artillery
for the time covered by the book strength varied from <num> to <num> men of all ranks
two figures who served at the fort are remembered for their impact outside its operation battery sergeant major charles moritz who initially joined the volunteer artillery and was the permanent artillery 's first recruit
joseph maria gordon <year> – <year> the fort 's first commander and later military commandant for south australia
gordon retired in <year> as chief of the general staff australian military forces
the faces of the fort join to form a half @-@ moon shape or lunette
the guns primary role was to defend port adelaide and the semaphore anchorage rather than the fort itself and the design reflects this
it was intended to be supported by field artillery cavalry and infantry for self @-@ defence and to repel landings
while the fort retains its original form the ditch and glacis embankment have been modified and are largely non @-@ existent in some areas
ground levels have been changed to accommodate paths and a caravan park and the original western fence no longer exists
the entrance road was constructed from military road to the fort 's rear gates
its path is largely followed by the modern queen elizabeth ii walk though the former road was slightly to the south
this walk links the conservation park 's visitor centre to the fort gates some of the old road can still be seen close to the gates
what was the muster ground is partly taken up by the caravan and camping park and a car park
it was levelled and filled in the <num> for this use
what remains of this ground north of the caravan park was returned to its <num> profile in <year> funded by a federal government grant
in the <num> century the muster ground was used for training of the volunteer military force including artillery who camped on the site
as designed the fort 's rear was protected with a wooden palisade or stockade
in <year> a masonry wall was added greatly strengthening defence
most of the stockade was reconstructed in the <num> some of the original wooden structure is visible in the fort 's north
it has a <num> @-@ metre <num> ft thick rampart with <num>
<num> m <num> ft of concrete and <num>
<num> m <num> ft of brick forming a retaining wall for the earth fill
the rampart is covered by natural vegetation and in both the <num> and 21st century operation is closed to access to preserve this
the glacis gives extra protection to the fort and was designed to blend the fort into the landscape
it surrounded the fort on the north south and seaward sides and was made by forming the surrounding sandhills
the side facing the fort — the scarp — is steep and with the front face of the rampart forms a <num> ft <num>
<num> m wide ditch that can be raked by rifle fire from the caponier or the stockade 's sides
the outer face is a gentle slope and is designed to be covered by case shot fired from the fort 's <num> @-@ pounder guns
the southern glacis section was removed during sand mining and construction of the caravan park both after world war ii
the western glacis is changed but still visible and the northern glacis was recreated in <year> — showcasing the purpose of the glacis and the function of the caponier
access to the fort is via double gates at the fort 's rear one each through the stockade and the rear defence wall
both gates were removed or destroyed over time and the 21st century gates are reconstructions
the formal parade ground or manning parade lies between the rear walls and barracks and the raised terreplein
it was formerly used for drill training assembly and formal parades
first gravelled when constructed it was paved with tar in the <num> to solve drainage problems
around the seaward side of the manning parade runs the terreplein
it is a raised crescent shaped level on which the guns platforms sit and is ascended from the manning parade by ramps and stairs
after numerous proposals the sand hills rear and north of the fort were removed in <year> improving the fort 's land defence and allowing the <num> @-@ pounder guns to sweep the semaphore jetty
this now levelled area was used as a bivouac and exercise area for the colony 's volunteer troops
a stable office shed and gunner 's store were also erected north of the fort
the gunner 's shed was damaged by fire in <year> and replaced further eastward
these buildings did not survive into the 21st century
they were used for ready @-@ to @-@ use ammunition for the adjacent guns except for armour piercing shells which were stored in the rear @-@ defence wall 's archways
between the <num> @-@ pounders and the <num> gun positions are two raised observation platforms set into the structure for gun commanders to spot the fall of outgoing shells
ranging was either performed from here or from a ranging position set in the sand hills to the fort 's north
between the <num> guns is a t @-@ shaped loading gallery that draws shells and gunpowder via a hoist system from the magazine below
either side of the gallery was installed the armstrong mechanical loading systems for the <num> guns
these mechanical systems proved unsuccessful and were removed in the <num> though the southern one has been reconstructed
the magazine is accessed from the manning parade and is directly beneath the <num> gun loading gallery
voice pipes and hoists originally installed have been removed but their remains are visible
the caponier rifle gallery extends into the ditch between the rampart and glacis from the fort 's north west corner
it is connected to the fort via a tunnel running under the rampart from the manning parade
for blast protection and defensibility the tunnel was built with a dogleg
the caponier has rifle firing ports and was originally protected from direct artillery fire by the glacis
early plans showed the caponier extending from the fort 's south west and a tunnel linking the magazine and southern guns
iron shutters closed on the inside and were locked with wooden beams
in <year> the verandah facing the manning parade was enclosed with wooden shutters to keep the weather out
these shutters were removed during <num> @-@ century restoration work and the verandah returned to original condition
the roof was at first flat timber overlaid by <num> inches <num> cm of lime concrete
this first roof leaked and an iron roof was added in <year>
the first floor of the barracks contains the officer 's rooms and troop 's barracks room
its eastern outer wall is not flat incorporating a design feature known as hornwork which opens the field of fire from the rifle holes
some of the firing holes were bricked in during the <num> this has been only partly rectified during restoration
the basement contains the gunner 's mess canteen no
<num> ancillary store pantry and officer 's kitchen
the canteen sold everyday necessities as well as a few items like biscuits sweets and tobacco to the stationed troops
profits from the canteen were used to fund sporting equipment for the garrison
the no
<num> ancillary store was used for various pieces of delicate equipment fuses friction tubes and rockets
in <year> an explosion in the room caused a number of injuries damage to the store and to the above officer 's quarters
the barracks room and officer 's quarters are connected with a door probably added in the <num> as it is not part of the original plans
the barracks room accommodated approximately <num> men
for display purposes it is outfitted as for similar period barracks
a laboratory is built into the rear wall on the forts southern side
this room is set into the end of the rampart and was used to prepare gunpowder charges
a guardhouse was built at the manning parade 's southern end in <year>
it is now used as a duty room for the drill squad during recreation demonstrations but originally was a guard 's room and separate cells connected by telephone to fort largs
up to three men appear to have been accommodated in the guard 's room
when the fort was converted to use as a caravan park the guard house was converted to an ablution block
a store and ablution block were also built in <year> between the stockade and rear defence wall
they called for four <num> in <num> mm <num> long tons <num> t rifled muzzle @-@ loading rml guns two mounted in turrets and two behind vertical iron shields
this configuration of siege artillery had not been tried before and the plan was abandoned due to the large expected cost
two of the <num> in guns had been in south australia since c
<year> after a colonial government request but were not used in the eventual fort design
the final jervois scratchley design omitted the turret and iron shields
<num> @-@ pounder rml guns were substituted for two of the <num> in guns and <num> in <num> ton rml guns for the remaining two
the <num> ton guns were chosen over the then standard <num> ton gun by jervois after he saw the plans in england the decision influenced by the then fully committed nature of the royal arsenal
jervois had originally ordered the <num> ton guns but cancelled the order and changed to the armstrong <num> ton when the arsenal was unable fulfil the order
he also ordered armstrong 's mechanical loading and protected barbette system for the <num> ton guns
this original battery of four heavy guns remains in place at the fort
they were manufactured in <year> by wg armstrong and company and originally used the armstrong protected barbette loading system
they were made to the <year> pattern and supplied on traversing slides
the guns have a <num> @-@ inch <num> mm calibre a range of <num> @,@ <num> yards <num> @,@ <num> m with a muzzle velocity of <num> @,@ <num> feet per second <num> m s and are capable of penetrating <num> inches <num> cm of iron at <num> @,@ <num> yards <num> @,@ <num> m
they fire <num> @-@ pound <num> kg projectiles using a <num> @-@ pound <num> kg gunpowder cartridge
though they were insufficient against contemporary battleships they were seen as adequate for the light cruisers that the fort was expected to face
the carriages weighed <num> long tons <num> t and moved on semi @-@ circular traverses
the guns were loaded either manually — using the woolwich derrick system — or via the armstrong mechanical loader
the armstrong system enabled loading of the guns from behind the protection of the rampart whereas the manual system required at least two crew to be exposed on the rampart 's top
despite this the guns were manually loaded for most of their operational life as the armstrong cable drive was faulty and too difficult to maintain
the guns had a <num> @-@ man crew and loading took about <num> minutes a rate of fire that was only slightly faster using the armstrong equipment
by <year> the guns had together fired <num> rounds though not all at full charge with the records showing only <num> effective full charges
the platforms and traverses were scrapped in <year> but the gun barrels were uneconomic to cut up and were left in place
one gun platform and its equipment was rebuilt in <year> using money raised by fort glanville historical association volunteers working at the australian grand prix
they are rifled muzzle @-@ loading heavy guns weighing <num> long hundredweight <num> @,@ <num> kg with a <num>
<num> @-@ inch <num> mm calibre steel barrel
they were made to the model 's <year> pattern by the royal arsenal woolwich england in <year>
their intended use was to protect the flanks and approaches to the fort
these smaller guns use an <num> lb <num> kg charge of gunpowder to send a <num> lb <num> kg projectile up to <num> @,@ <num> yards <num> @,@ <num> m
there are iron rings fixed in the rampart wall that indicate traversing gun carriages were intended to be mounted though this never eventuated
the guns were supplied with siege over @-@ bank carriages
the lower carriage sections are the type made for the guns when used as field pieces and the upper sections are brackets that raise the guns to the over @-@ bank firing position
in this particular configuration the two guns are thought to be the last in the world
by the end of their active use in <year> together they had fired <year> rounds in practice though not all at full power as they are recorded as firing under <num> effective full charges
by then the wheels were significantly rotted and the ammunition limbers had become unserviceable
less wheels the guns were removed from the fort in <year> adelaide 's city council then set them in brougham gardens north adelaide
both were returned to the fort in <year> and remounted on restored carriages of the original design
they are the only two guns of their type remaining in australia
the southern gun number <num> fired three blank charges in <year> to mark the centenary of the first firing at the fort
this same gun is fired regularly by the volunteers of the fort glanville historical association fgha
both types of heavy guns used where the only ones of their specific series and type to come to australia
though they were never fired in anger the battery is only <num> feet <num> m above mean sea level which would have limited the accuracy of the mark iii depression rangefinders used
this use was rejected by military authorities and the guns sat unused
in <year> the south australian defence committee proposed that the guns be mounted at fort glanville replacing the <num> @-@ pounders whose siege carriages were then unfit for service
this proposal would have greatly extended the useful life of the fort at little cost
the two military branches army and navy could not reach agreement and the proposal was abandoned by <year>
the gun 's eventual fate is unknown though a gun found in the port river later indicates they may have been dumped
gun emplacements were made about a mile apart south of the fort for six <num> @-@ pounder field guns to provide close defence in case of an attempted beach landing
from <year> the fort was equipped with moveable armament
it received an <year> whitworth <num> @-@ pounder rml field gun and a <num> @-@ barrel <num>
<num> martini @-@ henry cartridge firing nordenfelt gun
the <num> @-@ pounder had fired <num> effective full charges by <year> at which time both weapons were obsolete and their eventual fate is unknown
a <num> @-@ pounder <num> long cwt <num> @,@ <num> kg smoothbore gun on a stepped wooden carriage was purchased in <year>
manufactured by the royal arsenal in <year> it was the familiar ships cannon and came to south australia with two other identical guns
by <year> no ammunition was held for it and it was listed as for instruction only
the gun was probably destroyed in the <num> — certainly by the end of the <num> — with pieces of such a gun found on site in <year>
in the late <num> century the fort acquired three <num> @-@ pounder rml mark i field guns
they were formerly used by a battery south australian volunteer artillery from <year> until <year>
gun number <num> is complete and used for blank firings by the historical association
also acquired is a <num> @-@ pounder rml whitworth mountain gun made in <year>
it was also used by a battery subsequently by fort largs as a signal gun
it is one of only two of this type known to exist the other in the united kingdom
the visitors centre has two <num> @-@ pounder brass smoothbore field guns made by h c king in <year>
they arrived in south australia in <year> and were used for practice shoots near the fort c
<year> one is known to have been on the manning parade in <year> though its use is unknown
they later became saluting guns at fort largs moving by <year> to near the jervois wing of the state library of south australia
the art gallery of south australia saved them from a <year> wartime scrap drive and mounted them on reproduction naval carriages in front of government house in <year>
the gallery took them back in late <year> and transferred them to the history trust of south australia in <year>
the history trust has loaned them to fort glanville for display
outside the visitor 's centre is a <num> in <num> mm breech @-@ loading armstrong <num> long cwt <num> @,@ <num> kg gun no

the commonwealth scientific and industrial research organisation csiro brought it to the state in <year> for research subsequently moving it to perry engineering at mile end
in <year> the csiro donated the gun to the park
though guns had already been purchased specially plans for the third fort at glenelg were not proceeded with
south australia was experiencing a depression in <year> and that coupled with a report by general james bevan edwards scuttled plans for the third coastal fort
as early as <year> the emphasis for defence of the adelaide coast had already shifted to fort largs a fact cited as part of the reason for abandonment of the glenelg fortifications
from this point fort glanville 's significance declined rapidly
fort largs was equipped in <year> with two <num> inch breech @-@ loading disappearing guns which outranged glanville 's armament
the decline was also linked to changes in port adelaide 's maritime facilities and the consequent northward movement of anchored and berthed vessels
during the <num> the port river was deepened enabling large ships to sail up and berth rather than the former practice of anchoring off @-@ shore
the fort remained as headquarters of south australia 's permanent military force until the <num> and as late as <year> there were still plans to upgrade the <num> @-@ pounder armament though without result
by <year> the fort was manned on a caretaker basis only and no permanent forces were stationed
the federal government assumed responsibility for south australian defence in <year> and took over the fort
though glanville by then had no significant defence role the state received £ <num> @,@ <num> in compensation
from that point its significance was not defence related but as the first and best preserved <num> @-@ century fortification in south australia
though both infantry and artillery units were housed at the site on occasion by <year> there was no longer a permanent military presence at the fort
for most of the <num> century the site was neglected and largely vacated
it did attract some usage though not always of a military nature
during world war i it was partly revived for a former use with ammunition stored on site
during the same period however the military used it as a detention barracks
some or all of the fort was leased for private accommodation during the great depression
during the <num> the magazine was again used this time to store small arms ammunition
from june <year> until the beginning of world war ii the site housed a sea scout detachment and was used as a district camp @-@ site for the boy scouts
the department of defence decided in <year> that much of the equipment and fittings at the fort were surplus to requirements
consequent to this the mountings and carriages for the <num> inch guns were removed and sold as scrap though effort was made to scrap the barrels it proved uneconomic and they were left in place
in an unusual turn of events the fort briefly housed refugees
twenty @-@ nine islanders from the maldives were rescued from their sinking dhow by a ship bound for wallaroo
they stayed at the fort for a week in <year> before repatriation could be arranged
during world war ii the fort again attracted military related use
during <year> the proof and experimental establishment at port wakefield made use of the site to proof ordnance qf <num> pounder anti @-@ tank guns manufactured at general motors holden in woodville
the fort was also used as a residence again with at least two families reported as living in the under @-@ ground sections during the war
after the war the state government negotiated with its federal counterpart to gain control of fort glanville
this eventuated in the <year> sale of the <num> @-@ acre <num> ha site which was subsequently administered by the state tourist department as a caravan and camping park
the park occupied the muster ground outside the fort and the fort 's barracks building was used as a manager 's residence
the caravan park has had various managers since establishment until <year> it was managed by the national parks and wildlife service npws by woodville council until <year> and subsequently by a private operator under a long @-@ term lease
a significant change in the fort 's conservation and preservation outlook was its declaration as a historic relic under the aboriginal and historic relics preservation act in <year>
up to then there had been growing awareness of the significance of the site in terms of the state 's colonial heritage
control of the park was moved to the national parks and wildlife service npws and the fort and surrounds became designated as fort glanville conservation park
the national estate grants program provided funds in <year> for conservation work npws began this work in the same year and the caravan park boundary was moved southwards
though the site had long been neglected there was minimal permanent damage to its structure
during the <num> reconstruction much of the stockade was replaced
the replaced timbers are visibly different as they have shrunk significantly with large gaps that are not evident in the original timber
adelaide city council agreed to return the <num> @-@ pounder guns and new wheels were made replacing those rotted over half a century before
in a ceremony on <num> october <year> the <num> anniversary of the guns first firing one of the <num> @-@ pounders was fired again later a commemoration plaque was added to the fort 's flagpole 's base
shortly after this firing the fort glanville historical association was formed and was incorporated in <year>
fort glanville was opened for public visitation in <year>
as part of south australia 's sesquicentenary the south australia jubilee <num> board granted <num> @,@ <num> for work on the fort allowing construction of a visitor centre
queen elizabeth ii visited and inspected the site and newly constructed visitor centre for almost an hour on <num> march <year>
for the visit the historical association demonstrated firing of both the <num> and <num> pounder cannons
the visitor centre was officially opened one month after this visit
governor dame roma mitchell named the old road queen elizabeth ii walk in march <year> ceremony commemorating the <num> anniversary of the queen 's visit
considerable subsequent restoration work has been completed on the fort including the barrack 's interior
the portion of the muster ground that is not within the caravan park was returned to its original level in <year>
it is the premier site in the state and possibly australia for showcasing colonial era defences and fortifications
the fort is listed on both the south australian heritage register and the national trust 's classified list
it is considered significant in national historical military terms for its association with jervois and scratchley both leading british defence experts who influenced australian defence thinking in the late <num> century
the fort was very well constructed with high quality materials facts that have been noted as contributing to its preservation
the fort is largely intact and in original condition and is along with bluff battery in hobart the best preserved jervois @-@ scratchley designed fort in australia
it is the only australian colonial fort to still have all of its original armament and the only to have a regular living history program
its companion fort largs does survive but in greatly modified condition converted for use as the south australia police academy
the fort retains its original armament armament that is both rare in australia and worldwide
the conservation park is in the suburb of semaphore park at the southern end of the lefevre peninsula
it covers approximately <num> hectares <num> acres and is bounded by bower and military roads the point malcolm reserve and semaphore beach
the land is entirely crown land and is administered by the dewnr
it is divided into roughly two halves with the northern containing the fort and the southern half containing a caravan park
while it is managed by the dewnr the fort glanville consultative committee and fort glanville historical association are heavily involved
the committee is appointed by the minister for environment and planning and acts to advise the minister and liaise with the community
as of <year> the fort hosted approximately <num> @,@ <num> visitors annually and is used as an event venue including the annual city of charles sturt citizenship ceremony
the historical association is an incorporated body of volunteers who use the fort under licence from the minister
the association operate the fort and visitor centre holding monthly public open days at which the history of the fort is recreated this includes drill demonstrations and firing of the fort 's weapons
the association maintain static displays of the fort 's active period and sell souvenirs
the association 's goal is to have the site open as a fully operational fort for interpretation tourism and education
the volunteers are involved with recreation living history and ceremonial work outside the fort
they act as guards of honour at some government house functions and attended the restoration opening of the albany western australia fort and the annual re @-@ enactment of the battle of waterloo in keyneton victoria
the fort has living history displays including the barracks laid out and furnished in period detail

prerogative powers were formerly exercised by the monarch acting on his or her own initiative
since the <num> century by convention the advice of the prime minister or the cabinet — who are then accountable to parliament for the decision — has been required in order for the prerogative to be exercised
the monarch remains constitutionally empowered to exercise the royal prerogative against the advice of the prime minister or the cabinet but in practice would only do so in emergencies or where existing precedent does not adequately apply to the circumstances in question
today the royal prerogative is available in the conduct of the government of the united kingdom including foreign affairs defence and national security
the monarchy has a significant constitutional presence in these and other matters but limited power because the exercise of the prerogative is in the hands of the prime minister and other ministers or other government officials
a prominent constitutional theorist a
v
dicey proposed in the nineteenth century that the prerogative appears to be historically and as a matter of fact nothing else than the residue of discretionary or arbitrary authority which at any given time is legally left in the hands of the crown
the prerogative is the name of the remaining portion of the crown 's original authority
every act which the executive government can lawfully do without the authority of an act of parliament is done in virtue of the prerogative
while many commentators follow the diceyan view there are constitutional lawyers who prefer the definition given by william blackstone in the <num> by the word prerogative we usually understand that special pre @-@ eminence which the king hath over and above all other persons and out of the ordinary course of common law in right of his regal dignity
it can only be applied to those rights and capacities which the king enjoys alone in contradiction to others and not to those which he enjoys in common with any of his subjects
dicey 's opinion that any action of governance by the monarch beyond statute is under the prerogative diverges from blackstone 's that the prerogative simply covers those actions that no other person or body in the united kingdom can undertake such as the dissolution of parliament
case law exists to support both views
blackstone ’ s notion of the prerogative being the powers of an exclusive nature was favoured by lord parmoor in the de keyser ’ s royal hotel case of <year> but some difficulty with it was expressed by lord reid in the burmah oil case of <year>
a clear distinction has not been necessary in the relevant cases and the courts may never need to settle the question as few cases deal directly with the prerogative itself
from the <num> century in england as in france the monarch was all @-@ powerful but this absolute power was checked by the recrudescence of feudal turbulence in the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries
an early attempt to define the royal prerogative was stated by richard ii 's judges in <num>
during the <num> century this turbulence began to recede and the monarch became truly independent
under henry viii and his successors the king was the head of the protestant english church and therefore not answerable to the clergy
the rise of parliament in this period however was problematic
while the monarch was the predominant partner in the english constitution the courts stopped short of declaring him all @-@ powerful recognizing the role that parliament played
in ferrer 's case henry recognised this noting that he was far more powerful with the consent of parliament than without
nowhere was this more apparent than in the matter of taxation sir thomas smith and other writers of the period pointed out the monarch could not impose taxation without parliament 's consent
at the same time henry and his descendants normally followed the will of the courts despite the fact they were theoretically not bound by judges
william holdsworth infers that by regularly asking the legal officers of the crown and judiciary for legal advice and consent henry recognised the need for a stable government to follow the law
he also contends that the view that the law is supreme over all was the view of all the leading lawyers and statesmen and publicists of the tudor period
it was accepted that while the king had unfettered discretion he was limited in areas where the courts had imposed conditions on the use of the prerogative or where he had chosen to do so
the first dent in this stability came about in <year> with the case of prohibitions
james vi and i claimed that as monarch he had a divine right to sit as a judge and interpret the common law as he saw fit
led by sir edward coke the judiciary rejected this idea stating that while the monarch was not subject to any individual he was subject to the law
until he had gained sufficient knowledge of the law he had no right to interpret it coke pointed out that such knowledge demanded mastery of an artificial reason
which requires long study and experience before that a man can attain to the cognizance of it
similarly in the case of proclamations in <year> coke held that the monarch could only exercise those prerogatives he already had and not create new ones
with the glorious revolution king james vii and ii was replaced by queen mary ii and her husband king william iii
at the same time the bill of rights <year> was drafted which cemented the monarch 's subservience to parliament
it specifically limited the royal prerogative with article <num> holding that the power of suspending the laws or the execution of laws by regal authority without consent of parliament is illegal and article <num> confirming that levying money for or to the use of the crown by pretence of prerogative without grant of parliament for longer time or in other manner than the same is or shall be granted is illegal
the bill also confirmed that parliament had the right to limit the use of remaining prerogatives as evidenced by the triennial act <year> which required the monarch to dismiss and call parliament at certain times
this prerogative was normally exercised at the request of parliament and the prime minister either at his or her discretion or following a motion of no confidence
constitutional theorists have had differing views as to whether a unilateral dissolution of parliament would be possible today sir ivor jennings wrote that a dissolution involves the acquiescence of ministers and as such the monarch could not dissolve parliament without ministerial consent if ministers refuse to give such advice she can do no more than dismiss them
a
v
dicey however believed that in certain extreme circumstances the monarch could dissolve parliament single @-@ handedly on the condition that an occasion has arisen on which there is fair reason to suppose that the opinion of the house is not the opinion of the electors
a dissolution is allowable or necessary whenever the wishes of the legislature are or may fairly be presumed to be different from the wishes of the nation
the monarch could force the dissolution of parliament through a refusal of royal assent this would inevitably lead to a government resigning
by convention the monarch always assents to bills the last time the royal assent was not given was in <year> during the reign of queen anne
this does not mean that the right to refuse has died george v believed he could veto the third irish home rule bill jennings writes that it was assumed by the king throughout that he had not only the legal power but the constitutional right to refuse assent
the royal prerogative to dissolve parliament was abrogated by the fixed @-@ term parliaments act <year>
section <num> <num> of the act however specifically states that the monarch 's power to prorogue parliament is not affected by the act
the appointment of the prime minister is also theoretically governed by the royal prerogative
technically the monarch may appoint as prime minister anyone she wants to appoint but in practice the appointee is always the person who commands a majority in the house of commons
usually this is the leader of the political party that is returned to parliament with a majority of seats after a general election
difficulties may result with a so @-@ called hung parliament in which no party commands majority support as last occurred in <year>
in this situation constitutional convention is that the previous incumbent has the first right to form a coalition government and seek appointment
if the prime minister decides to retire in the middle of a parliamentary session as anthony eden did in <year> the monarch has no discretion
there is usually a prime minister @-@ in @-@ waiting who commands the support of the majority of the commons he or she will near @-@ automatically be appointed
pardons may eliminate the pains penalties and punishments from a criminal conviction though they do not remove convictions themselves
this power is commonly exercised on the advice of the secretary of state for the home department the monarch has no direct involvement in its use
exercises of this power may also take the form of commutations a limited form of pardon where the sentences is reduced on certain conditions
the granting of a pardon is not subject to judicial review as confirmed by council of civil service unions v minister for the civil service but the courts have chosen to criticise its application or lack thereof as in r v secretary of state for the home department ex parte bentley
granting nolle prosequi is done by the attorney general of england and wales or the equivalent in scotland or northern ireland in the name of the crown to stop legal proceedings against an individual
this is not reviewable by the courts as confirmed by r v comptroller of patents and does not count as an acquittal the defendant may be brought before the courts on the same charge at a later date
it is the monarch who recognises foreign states although several statutes regulate the immunities enjoyed by their heads and diplomatic representatives issues declarations of war and peace and forms international treaties
the monarch also has the power to annex territory as was done in <year> with the island of rockall
once territory has been annexed the monarch has complete discretion as to the extent to which the government will take over the former government 's liabilities this was confirmed in west rand central gold mining company v the king
the monarch also has the power to alter british territorial waters and cede territory
her freedom to do these things in practice is doubtful in that they might deprive british citizens of their nationality and rights
when the island of heligoland was ceded to germany in <year> parliamentary approval was first sought
the monarch can also regulate colonies and dependent territories by exercising the prerogative through orders in council
the courts have long fought against the monarch 's use of this power in r bancoult v secretary of state for foreign and commonwealth affairs no <num> the court of appeal ruled that using orders @-@ in @-@ council to frustrate judicial rulings was an unlawful abuse of power although this ruling was later overturned
british passports are also issued under the prerogative though these are also covered by statute law
under the common law citizens have the right freely to leave and enter the united kingdom
in r v foreign secretary ex parte everett the courts held that it was their right to review the granting of passports to and the withholding of passports from british citizens
the writ of ne exeat regno is also used to prevent a person leaving the country
the right to make treaties is a disputed prerogative power under blackstone 's definition a prerogative power must be one unique to the monarch
although the granting of most honours is normally decided by the executive the monarch is still the person who technically awards them
exceptions to this rule are membership of the order of the garter the order of the thistle the order of merit the royal victorian order and the royal victorian chain which the monarch has complete discretion to grant
in relation to the armed forces the monarch is the commander in chief and members are regulated under the royal prerogative
most statutes do not apply to the armed forces although some areas such as military discipline are governed by acts of parliament
under the crown proceedings act <year> the monarch is the sole authority for the armed forces and as such their organisation disposition and control cannot be questioned by the courts
this exercise of prerogative power gives the crown authority to recruit members of the armed forces appoint commissioned officers and establish agreements with foreign governments to station troops in their territory
the prerogative empowers the monarch to appoint bishops and archbishops in the church of england and to regulate the printing and licensing of the authorised church of england version of the bible
r v secretary of state for the home department ex parte northumbria police authority recognised that the prerogative also includes the power to take all reasonable steps to preserve the queen 's peace and in burmah oil co
v lord advocate the house of lords took the view that it extended to doing all those things in an emergency which are necessary for the conduct of the second world war
leyland notes that the present queen
is kept very closely in touch with the exercise of governmental power by means of a weekly audience with the prime minister during which she is fully briefed about the affairs of government
but it should be emphasised that the prime minister is not under any obligation to take account of royal opinions
in simple terms the prerogative is used to govern the realm in the name of the crown although the monarch has the right to be consulted the right to encourage and the right to warn her role involves no exercise of discretion
today some prerogative powers are directly exercised by ministers without the approval of parliament including the powers of declaring war and of making peace the issue of passports and the granting of honours
prerogative powers are exercised nominally by the monarch but on the advice of the prime minister whom the monarch meets weekly and of the cabinet
some key functions of the british government are still executed by virtue of the royal prerogative but generally the usage of the prerogative has been diminishing as functions are progressively put on a statutory basis
in <year> an appeal was made to the house of lords re petition of right shoreham aerodrome case but during the appeal the case was settled and the appeal withdrawn when the crown agreed to pay compensation
the appeal was from a unanimous decision of the court of appeal that the crown both under the statutory defence of the realm regulations and by the royal prerogative was entitled to take and occupy for military purposes in wartime a commercial airfield on the south coast
the government argued that this action was to defend against an invasion the courts held that for the prerogative to be exercised the government must demonstrate that a threat of invasion exists
this was backed up by the zamora <year> where the privy council on appeal from the prize court held generally that to exercise a power not granted by statute such as a prerogative power the government must prove to the court that the exercise is justified
the next decision came in attorney general v de keyser 's royal hotel ltd <year> where the house of lords confirmed that a statutory provision in an area where prerogative powers are in use abridges the royal prerogative while it is in force to this extent – that the crown can only do the particular thing under and in accordance with the statutory provisions and that its prerogative power to do that thing is in abeyance
this principle of statutory superiority was extended in laker airway ltd v department of trade concerning the revocation of a commercial airline operator 's licence december <year> where it was confirmed that prerogative powers could not be used to contradict a statutory provision and that in situations to which the power and the statute both applied the power could only be used to further the aim of the statute
another extension came with r v secretary of state for the home department ex parte fire brigades union where the court of appeal held that even if a statute had not yet come into force the prerogative could not be used to alter this statute to conflict with parliament 's wishes
they therefore applied only the first of the wednesbury tests whether the use was illegal
constitutional scholars such as william blackstone consider this appropriate in the exertion therefore of those prerogatives which the law has given him the king is irresistible and absolute according to the forms of the constitution
and yet if the consequence of that exertion be manifestly to the grievance or dishonour of the kingdom the parliament will call his advisers to a just and severe account
during the <num> and <num> this attitude was changing with lord denning saying in the laker airway case that seeing that the prerogative is a discretionary power to be exercised for the public good it follows that its exercise can be examined by the courts just as any other discretionary power which is vested in the executive
the most authoritative case on the matter is council of civil service unions v minister for the civil service generally known as the gchq case
the house of lords confirmed that the application of judicial review would be dependent on the nature of the government 's powers not their source
foreign policy and national security powers are considered outside the scope of judicial review while the prerogative of mercy is considered within it as per r v secretary of state for the home department ex parte bentley
the ministry of justice undertook a review of executive royal prerogative powers in october <year>
former labour mp and cabinet minister tony benn campaigned unsuccessfully for the abolition of the royal prerogative in the united kingdom in the <num> arguing that all governmental powers in effect exercised on the advice of the prime minister and cabinet should be subject to parliamentary scrutiny and require parliamentary approval
later governments argued that such is the breadth of topics covered by the royal prerogative that requiring parliamentary approval in each instance where the prerogative is currently used would overwhelm parliamentary time and slow the enactment of legislation

the project was built with two firsts the first single @-@ point urban interchange spui ˈspuːiː in michigan and a new technique to apply the pavement markings embedding them into the concrete to reduce the chance of a snowplow scraping them off
in advance of the opening of the freeway to traffic the michigan department of transportation mdot allowed the public to walk or bike the south beltline in an open @-@ house event called the southbelt shuffle
the freeway runs southeast from the interchange through the rural georgetown and jamestown townships toward the county line
through this area mdot traffic surveys measured a traffic count of <num> @,@ <num> vehicles on average per day the lowest along the freeway in <year>
at kenowa avenue the south beltline crosses into byron township in kent county
the freeway corridor is bounded on each side by farmland scattered subdivisions and small pockets of woodland
near the wilson avenue interchange m @-@ <num> curves to the northeast around the edge of the ironwood golf course and heads for the interchange with byron center avenue
on either side of the freeway at byron center avenue there are two hospitals metro health and st
mary 's southwest the former located on the very southern edge of the city of wyoming
continuing east the beltline curves to the southeast and into the cloverleaf interchange complex at us <num>
this mammoth interchange stretches over a half mile <num>
<num> km in one direction and over a mile <num>
<num> km in the other encompassing <num> bridges and <num> retaining walls
this makes it the largest freeway interchange in western michigan
there are four overpasses which carry m @-@ <num> over the us <num> freeway two for the main carriageways in each direction and two for the collector @-@ distributor lanes on each side
the auxiliary lanes funnel the traffic using the interchange off the main carriageways to eliminate conflicts between merging streams of traffic
in the eastbound direction the collector @-@ distributor lane also has access to a ramp for traffic bound for <num> street which runs parallel to and south of the m @-@ <num> freeway
no such access to <num> street is provided for westbound m @-@ <num> traffic although <num> street traffic can access each direction of m @-@ <num> or us <num>
east of us <num> m @-@ <num> crosses over division avenue and enters gaines township through a series of sound barrier walls as the freeway ramps merge back into the main lanes
this area had the highest traffic counts in <year> at <num> @,@ <num> vehicles per day
near kalamazoo avenue the freeway passes through an area with retail businesses and movie theaters on each side of the interchange to the northeast is east kentwood high school
on the approach to the east paris avenue underpass m @-@ <num> curves first to the northeast and then back to the southeast passing near one of steelcase 's office buildings the pyramid @-@ shaped corporate development center
the freeway begins to curve to the northeast as it crosses into caledonia township with an interchange for m @-@ <num> broadmoor avenue and an overpass for <num> street
m @-@ <num> curves around the southeast side of the gerald r
ford international airport in cascade township
as the south beltline nears i @-@ <num> it crosses <num> street next to the thornapple pointe golf course
the carriageway splits into ramps for each direction of i @-@ <num> the ramps to eastbound i @-@ <num> crossing over the thornapple river in the process
this interchange marks the eastern terminus of the paul b
henry south beltline freeway
the entire length of the freeway is listed on the national highway system a system of roads important to the nation 's economy defense and mobility
the right @-@ of @-@ way along m @-@ <num> includes a <num> @-@ mile <num> km pedestrian path known as the frederik meijer trail
previously called the m @-@ <num> trail it links the kent trails west of byron center avenue in wyoming with the paul henry rail trail at <num> street and wing avenue by paris park in kentwood
<num> km road in keweenaw county in the upper peninsula
the highway ran from us <num> at phoenix to north of eagle river
the michigan state highway department redesignated the highway as m @-@ <num> in <year> and it was redesignated two years later to become a part of the route of m @-@ <num>
in the late <num> during the second phase of construction of the i @-@ <num> walter p
reuther freeway in metro detroit lobbying efforts and lawsuits attempted to block construction of the central section
if successful the efforts would have left the freeway with a gap in the middle between the first western and second eastern phases of construction
during this time mdot assigned m @-@ <num> to the eastern section of the freeway under construction
signs were erected along the service roads that followed <num> mile road to connect the already built stack interchange at i @-@ <num> east to i @-@ <num>
by the time the eastern freeway segment was completed in <year> the signage for m @-@ <num> was removed and replaced with i @-@ <num> signage leaving an eight @-@ mile <num> km gap in the i @-@ <num> freeway until completion of the central section in <year>
the idea dates back to the <num> but serious proposals were not made until the <num>
the <year> planning map for the grand rapids area interstate highways included a freeway roughly along the m @-@ <num> corridor before i @-@ <num> and i @-@ <num> were shifted north and east to their current locations
an increase in the state gas tax was approved in <year> with the goal to finance local road projects in the state including the south beltline
the project was anticipated to cost <num> – <num> million equivalent to <num> – <num> million in <year> in june <year> with an expected groundbreaking in <year> – <num>
the highway was studied in january <year> for <num> @,@ <num> equivalent to <num> @,@ <num> in <year>
the choice of consultants on the project was controversial local planners felt that mdot picked bki inc
only because they used a minority @-@ owned subcontractor and not because they would be qualified for the assignment
as this study was initiated the route for the proposed freeway was located between <num> and <num> streets with a western end in hudsonville and an eastern end in lowell township
the consultants were asked to study a full freeway and a limited access boulevard design
one final option was a no @-@ build alternative under this option existing roads would be upgraded but no new roads would be built
the city of grand rapids opposed the freeway while the suburbs and townships south and west of the city supported it
city officials were concerned about the impact to commercial and industrial business in grand rapids
hudsonville 's city manager favored the proposal as a benefit to local vegetable producers who shipped produce to detroit or cleveland
other supporters such as the georgetown township supervisor were concerned that delays in starting the project could increase costs
state and local officials expected the freeway in january <year> to cost between <num> – <num> million equivalent to <num> – <num> million in <year>
the road was to be started no sooner than <year>
the boundaries for the highway corridor were determined by the consultants in april <year> running between <num> and <num> streets dipping like a hammock beneath the cities of kentwood and wyoming
the results of the study by bki were criticized by local planners in may <year> who called the study shabby and unprofessional work and asked the state to fire the consulting firm
local residents distributed <num> @,@ <num> fliers to their neighbors in opposition to the freeway
the south belt local advisory board criticized bki 's <num> @-@ page study report as filled with errors the consultants earlier <num> @-@ page paper had been rejected by the board and mdot as unusable
an editorial in the the grand rapids press stated that the study did not help advance the project in the area instead opening the proposed freeway up to new controversies
doubts about the state 's budget in <year> to build the roadway combined with issues over the consultants and their study results
a second citizens group the south belt citizens committee was formed in july <year> to gain additional public information on the project and supplement the work of the other groups including the south belt local advisory board
bki was fired as consultant on the project by mdot on september <num> <year>
the switch to a new consultant delayed further study because of the timetable to take bids and interview the candidates
in the interim work was shifted to local and state planners until a new consultant could be retained in an effort to minimize the delays involved
these local projects were focused on updating the information and maps from bki 's study and refining the scope of the highway 's corridor
gaines cascade and caledonia townships and the city of kentwood circulated a survey amongst their communities planning commissions and elected boards in <year>
the survey showed an inconclusive preference for a limited @-@ access highway in what was termed a gut level reaction to the proposed roadway
the south belt citizens committee actively started to oppose the roadway during the fall of <year> pressing local candidates for political office to take positions on the project
the group called the roadway a holocaust in its mailings to the candidates
future lieutenant governor dick posthumus then a member of the michigan state senate called for an end to the studies in <year> he would later reverse and become one of the project 's biggest supporters
mdot hired a new consultant schimpeler coradino associates in <year> to study the proposed freeway
the consultant recommended the freeway in march <year>
the south beltline was included in the ten @-@ year highway plan in <year>
by <year> the state wanted to set the route in <year> with construction starting in <year>
the freeway was studied as a possible toll road in june <year> after three alternative routes were proposed the previous year
that september the final route was set with a projected start date in <year>
the toll road concept was revived in september <year> to offset the failure of a proposed gas tax increase
as a cost @-@ saving measure the number of interchanges was reduced to four from eight in june <year>
when a gas tax increase was passed in <year> governor john engler promised at least seven access points for the freeway
the south beltline was touted as cutting travel time around grand rapids virtually in half
the michigan state legislature named the south beltline around the same time for the congressman paul b
henry who died in office in <year> serving in gerald ford 's old us house seat
the cost of the construction of new roads like the south beltline was a campaign issue when engler ran for re @-@ election against geoffrey feiger in <year>
the entire freeway was projected to open by <year> with the first phase opening in <year>
mdot gave the south beltline its numerical designation on the july <year> edition of the state map marking m @-@ <num> for the first time as a dotted line to denote it was under construction
the legislature approved engler 's build michigan iii program in <year> the plan accelerated road projects in the state
the capital outlay for the year was <num> million equivalent to <num> million in <year>
condemnation proceedings were initiated in the kent county circuit court in <year> to clear the way for the acquisitions
land that contained homes farms trailer parks and businesses was purchased by mdot to acquire the right @-@ of @-@ way needed for the freeway
the land needed measured <num> feet <num> m wide and <num> miles <num> km long
land acquisitions for the south beltline freeway were completed in july <year>
construction started later in the fall of <year> on the second and third phases of the project
the first leg of the south beltline freeway located between m @-@ <num> broadmoor avenue and i @-@ <num> was finished six months early
dry summer weather allowed the roadbed contractors to finish their portion of the five @-@ mile <num>
<num> km section of the freeway early earning them a <num> @,@ <num> bonus equivalent to <num> @,@ <num> in <year>
the overpasses for the remaining sections of the freeway were completed while the first phase was under construction leaving the interchanges at us <num> and i @-@ <num> and the connecting roadbed to be completed at that time
the first section was paved in asphalt after mdot reversed the decision to pave the whole freeway in concrete
that stretch of freeway opened to traffic on november <num> <year>
the state kept the overall project in an accelerated status headed into the next phases in <year>
area roads that crossed the path of the new freeway were closed to traffic with posted detours so that work could begin on the roadbed for the freeway
the last major project for the freeway was to replace bridge beams in the overpasses from westbound i @-@ <num> to eastbound m @-@ <num>
design flaws were found in <year> in the size of the beams in the bridges over eastbound i @-@ <num> and the ramp from westbound m @-@ <num> to westbound i @-@ <num>
the replacement was originally supposed to close traffic along i @-@ <num> over a weekend in <year> but kept a lane closed for a full week backing up traffic on the interstate for two miles <num>
<num> km completion of the work was delayed when human error caused a shortage of nuts and bolts
mdot hosted an open house along the unopened section of m @-@ <num> between kalamazoo and byron center avenues
this event took place on october <num> <year> and was billed as the southbelt shuffle allowing the public to walk or bike along the freeway
the event was planned to draw attention to the m @-@ <num> trail that runs parallel to the freeway
some event participants brought their horses for the chance to ride on the freeway
the whole freeway was opened to traffic on november <num> <year> after a ribbon cutting ceremony
when opened reconstruction work was still being completed on overpass bridges at the i @-@ <num> interchange on the west end
the entire project cost <num> million equivalent to <num> million in <year> to complete over the five @-@ year construction period about <num> million mi approximately <num> million km equivalent to <num> million mi or <num> million km in <year>
when the freeway was opened it was the first in the state of michigan to use a spui located at the kalamazoo avenue exit
all of the bridges and sound barrier walls were painted sienna beige as part of a color theme to the freeway
mdot also used a new technique to recess the pavement markings into the concrete designed to reduce the likelihood that snowplows would scrape them off
the signs are in miles but the entire m @-@ <num> freeway was designed and constructed in metric according to mdot manager suzette peplinski
the final ramps opened to traffic on december <num> <year>
at the time the various online mapping services still did not show a complete freeway in eastern ottawa or southern kent counties
services such as mapquest and yahoo maps rely on tele atlas out of new hampshire for their mapping information which in turn relies on agencies like mdot to update their data
mdot 's map update came out nearly eight months after the initial opening due to its inclusion in a large @-@ scale update to the state highway map
a year after the freeway opened traffic volumes along parallel roads like <num> <num> and <num> streets dropped <num> – <num>
at the same time roads with interchanges along the freeway saw increased traffic
wilson avenue experienced a <num> increase and sections of byron center avenue jumped <num> in traffic levels a month after m @-@ <num> opened
property values in the townships surrounding the freeway increased <num>
<num> – <num>
<num> by <year> as a result of development attached to the freeway
local officials credited the freeway for increased access to the area driving housing starts as residents flocked to the communities for their schools and quality of life
in <year> the metro health village a commercial development centered around the byron center avenue exit and the hospital opened
described as being similar to a mall with the hospital as a tenant the village features restaurants shops offices and a hotel
metro health relocated from grand rapids to the location in wyoming in the face of opposition to planned expansions of their previous location
since opening even though the freeway was officially named for paul henry the original south beltline name is still in use
reactions to the new freeway were not all positive
in a special editorial in the the grand rapids press after the freeway opened in <year> local resident curt macdougall summarized the criticisms of the new freeway
he cited the loss of rural farmland and wetlands as a negative effect of the highway
the editorial also discussed that the freeway does decrease travel times for some residents but it will mean increased development
that development will mean further urban sprawl and could spur the creation of additional highways in the area
the m @-@ <num> trail was constructed in a <num>
<num> million project equivalent to <num> million in <year> that started in <year>
the goal was to create a <num> @-@ foot @-@ wide <num>
<num> m path linking the kent trails with the paul henry rail trail
the m @-@ <num> trail was the brainchild of gaines township supervisor don hilton sr
he had pushed to have the path included in the original freeway construction and opened with the rest of the south beltline
the trail project was funded by <num>
<num> million equivalent to <num>
<num> million in <year> in federal grants and <num> @,@ <num> equivalent to <num> @,@ <num> in <year> from the frederik and lena meijer foundation
the balance came from kent county and the townships
work on the trail was completed in november <year>
in <year> the asphalt section of m @-@ <num> had to be repaired
this section of roadway between east paris avenue and <num> street was rated poorly by the michigan infrastructure and transportation association while the concrete west of broadmoor avenue had favorable marks
mdot budgeted <num> million in repairs on top of previous crack @-@ related fixes that were handled by the original pavement contractor under a warranty in <year>
the local press described the <num>
<num> @-@ mile <num>
<num> km stretch of road as troublesome in relation to pavement quality issues
legislation was signed by governor rick snyder on december <num> <year> to name the section of m @-@ <num> between byron center and kalamazoo avenues the david john warsen memorial highway
warsen a us navy seal was killed in a helicopter accident in afghanistan in <year>
this section of the highway was dedicated on august <num> <year>

<num> million people ranking <num> out of <num> in the weekly rankings
<num> out of <num> indicating that it was good but his review was mixed
comparing it with the rest of the season he opined that it suffered from some of the same problems of previous episodes
he thought that the actions of many of the characters in hi infidelity were out of character or unrealistic
while writing that the rape storyline is still not feeling nearly as weighty as it should he praised the development of the rape mystery for hinting that there were larger forces at work
price peterson of tv
com gave a positive review praising the case @-@ of @-@ the @-@ week 's emotional connection to veronica for raising the stakes and piz 's increased role

the reviewer was very critical of what he called the radical feminist fakes her own rape storyline but he praised the episode as the first one of the third season to make the college setting feel natural
although he thought that the case @-@ of @-@ the @-@ week contributed to his overall positive view of the episode he thought that it 's mostly the little things that make it work pointing out piz 's increased role as an example
the earliest known ceratopsian yinlong downsi lived between <num>
<num> and <num>
<num> million years ago
the last ceratopsian species triceratops prorsus became extinct during the cretaceous – paleogene extinction event <num> million years ago
early members of the ceratopsian group such as psittacosaurus were small bipedal animals
later members including ceratopsids like centrosaurus and triceratops became very large quadrupeds and developed elaborate facial horns and frills extending over the neck
while these frills might have served to protect the vulnerable neck from predators they may also have been used for display thermoregulation the attachment of large neck and chewing muscles or some combination of the above
ceratopsians ranged in size from <num> meter <num> ft and <num> kilograms <num> lb to over <num> meters <num> ft and <num> @,@ <num> kg <num> @,@ <num> lb
triceratops is by far the best @-@ known ceratopsian to the general public
it is traditional for ceratopsian genus names to end in -ceratops although this is not always the case
one of the first named genera was ceratops itself which lent its name to the group although it is considered a nomen dubium today as its fossil remains have no distinguishing characteristics that are not also found in other ceratopsians
on the tip of a ceratopsian upper jaw is the rostral bone an edentulous toothless ossification unique to ceratopsians
othniel charles marsh recognized and named this bone which acts as a mirror image of the predentary bone on the lower jaw
this ossification evolved to morphologically aid the mastication of plant matter
along with the predentary bone which forms the tip of the lower jaw in all ornithischians the rostral forms a superficially parrot @-@ like beak
also the jugal bones below the eye are very tall and flare out sideways making the skull appear somewhat triangular when viewed from above
this triangular appearance is accentuated in later ceratopsians by the rearwards extension of the parietal and squamosal bones of the skull roof to form the neck frill
the epoccipital is a distinctive bones found lining the frills of ceratopsians
the name is a misnomer as they are not associated with the occipital bone
epoccipitals begin as separate bones that fuse during the animal 's growth to either the squamosal or parietal bones that make up the base of the frill
these bones were ornamental instead of functional and may have helped differentiate species
epoccipitals probably were present in all known ceratopsids with the possible exception of zuniceratops
they appear to have been broadly different between short @-@ frilled ceratopsids centrosaurines and long @-@ frilled ceratopsids chasmosaurines being elliptical with constricted bases in the former group and triangular with wide bases in the latter group
within these broad definitions different species would have somewhat different shapes and numbers
in centrosaurines especially like centrosaurus pachyrhinosaurus and styracosaurus these bones become long and spike- or hook @-@ like
a well @-@ known example is the coarse sawtooth fringe of broad triangular epoccipitals on the frill of triceratops
when regarding the ossification 's morphogenetic traits it can be described as dermal
the term epoccipital was coined by famous paleontologist othniel charles marsh in <year>

geological and geographical survey of the territories led by the american geologist f
v
hayden
teeth discovered during an <year> expedition to montana were first assigned to hadrosaurids and included within the genus trachodon
it was not until the early <num> century that some of these were recognized as ceratopsian teeth
during another of hayden 's expeditions in <year> fielding bradford meek found several giant bones protruding from a hillside in southwestern wyoming
he alerted paleontologist edward drinker cope who led a dig to recover the partial skeleton
cope recognized the remains as a dinosaur but noted that even though the fossil lacked a skull it was different from any type of dinosaur then known
he named the new species agathaumas sylvestris meaning marvellous forest @-@ dweller
soon after cope named two more dinosaurs that would eventually come to be recognized as ceratopsids polyonax and monoclonius
monoclonius was notable for the number of disassociated remains found including the first evidence of ceratopsid horns and frills
several monoclonius fossils were found by cope assisted by charles hazelius sternberg in the summer of <year> near the judith river in chouteau county montana
since the ceratopsians had not been recognised yet as a distinctive group cope was uncertain about much of the fossil material not recognizing the nasal horn core nor the brow horns as part of a fossil horn
the frill bone was interpreted as a part of the breastbone
in <year> and <year> othniel charles marsh described the first well preserved horned dinosaurs ceratops and triceratops
in <year> marsh classified them together in the family ceratopsidae and the order ceratopsia
this prompted cope to reexamine his own specimens and to realized that triceratops monoclonius and agathaumas all represented a single group of similar dinosaurs which he named agathaumidae in <year>
cope redescribed monoclonius as a horned dinosaur with a large nasal horn and two smaller horns over the eyes and a large frill
marsh considered the group distinct enough to warrant its own suborder within ornithischia
the name is derived from the greek κερας keras meaning horn and οψις opsis meaning face
as early as the <num> it was noted that the name ceratopsia is actually incorrect linguistically and that it should be ceratopia
however this spelling while technically correct has been used only rarely in the scientific literature and the vast majority of paleontologists continue to use ceratopsia
as the iczn does not govern taxa above the level of superfamily this is unlikely to change
while ranked taxonomy has largely fallen out of favor among dinosaur paleontologists some researchers have continued to employ such a classification though sources have differed on what its rank should be
most who still employ the use of ranks have retained its traditional ranking of suborder though some have reduced to the level of infraorder
this list of ceratopsian genera by classification and location follows a review by thomas r

craspedodon from the late cretaceous santonian of belgium may also be a ceratopsian specifically a neoceratopsian closer to ceratopsoidea than protoceratopsidae
possible leptoceratopsid remains have also been described from the early campanian of sweden
there have been several cladistic studies performed on basal ceratopsians since <year>
none have used every taxon listed above and many of the differences between the studies are still unresolved
in clade @-@ based phylogenetic taxonomy ceratopsia is often defined to include all marginocephalians more closely related to triceratops than to pachycephalosaurus
under this definition the most basal known ceratopsians are yinlong from the late jurassic period along with chaoyangsaurus and the family psittacosauridae from the early cretaceous period all of which were discovered in northern china or mongolia
the rostral bone and flared jugals are already present in all of these forms indicating that even earlier ceratopsians remain to be discovered
the clade neoceratopsia includes all ceratopsians more derived than psittacosaurids
another subset of neoceratopsians is called coronosauria which currently includes all ceratopsians more derived than auroraceratops
coronosaurs show the first development of the neck frill and the fusion of the first several neck vertebrae to support the increasingly heavy head
within coronosauria three groups are generally recognized although the membership of these groups varies somewhat from study to study and some animals may not fit in any of them
one group can be called protoceratopsidae and includes protoceratops and its closest relatives all asian
another group leptoceratopsidae includes mostly north american animals that are more closely related to leptoceratops
the ceratopsoidea includes animals like zuniceratops which are more closely related to the family ceratopsidae
this last family includes triceratops and all the large north american ceratopsians and is further divided into the subfamilies centrosaurinae and ceratopsinae also known as chasmosaurinae
they analysed their taxa as well as most other primitive ceratopsians to get a consensus cladogram
they created their own data matrix and through it found that many groups of ceratopsians could be supported and that aquilops was a basal neoceratopsian that could potentially be a protoceratopsid leptoceratopsid or ceratopsid although any one of these groups would have a large ghost lineage with aquilops
their study also found an equal consensus cladogram finding ajkaceratops not as a neoceratopsian but a protoceratopsid
nothing else about the cladograms changed
this analysis is very similar to one published by makovicky in <year>
makovicky who currently works at the field museum of natural history in chicago also included this analysis in his <year> doctoral thesis
xu and other colleagues added yinlong to this analysis in <year>
brenda chinnery formerly of the museum of the rockies in bozeman montana independently described prenoceratops in <year> and published a new phylogeny
in <year> makovicky and mark norell of the amnh incorporated chinnery 's analysis into their own and also added yamaceratops although they were not able to include yinlong
the cladogram presented below is a combination of xu makovicky and their colleagues most recent work
chaoyangsaurus is recovered in a more basal position than psittacosauridae although chinnery 's original analysis finds it within neoceratopsia
protoceratopsidae is considered to be the sister group of ceratopsoidea
the fragmentary asiaceratops was included in these studies and is found to have a variable position either as a basal neoceratopsian or as a leptoceratopsid most likely due to the amount of missing information
removal of asiaceratops stabilizes the entire cladogram
makovicky 's latest analysis includes ivpp v12722 xuanhuasaurus a late jurassic ceratopsian from china that at the time was awaiting publication but has since been published as xuanhuaceratops
kulceratops and turanoceratops are considered nomina dubia in this study
makovicky believes lamaceratops magnirostris and platyceratops to be junior synonyms of bagaceratops and bainoceratops to be synonymous with protoceratops
the two presented this analysis again in <year>
in <year> you and three others including dodson published on auroraceratops and inserted this new dinosaur into their phylogeny
in contrast to the previous analysis you and dodson find chaoyangsaurus to be the most basal neoceratopsian more derived than psittacosaurus while leptoceratopsidae not protoceratopsidae is recovered as the sister group of ceratopsidae
this study includes auroraceratops but lacks seven taxa found in xu and makovicky 's work so it is unclear how comparable the two studies are
asiaceratops and turanoceratops are each considered nomina dubia and not included
along with dong zhiming you described magnirostris in <year> but to date has not included it in any of his cladograms
fragmentary remains including teeth which appear to be neoceratopsian are found in north america from the albian stage <num> to <num> million years ago indicating that the group had dispersed across what is now the bering strait by the middle of the cretaceous period
almost all leptoceratopsids are north american aside from udanoceratops which may represent a separate dispersal event back into asia
ceratopsids and their immediate ancestors such as zuniceratops were unknown outside of western north america and were presumed endemic to that continent
the traditional view that ceratopsoids originated in north america was called into question by the <year> discovery of better specimens of the dubious asian form turanoceratops which confirmed it as a ceratopsid
it is unknown whether this indicates ceratopsids actually originated in asia or if the turanoceratops immigrated from north america
there is a great deal of variation between and even within ceratopsian species
complete growth series from embryo to adult are known for psittacosaurus and protoceratops allowing the study of ontogenetic variation in these species
significant sexual dimorphism has been noted in protoceratops and several ceratopsids
triceratops fossils are far and away the most common dinosaur remains found in the latest cretaceous rocks in the western united states making up as much as <num> <num> of the large dinosaur fauna in some areas
these facts indicate that some ceratopsians were the dominant herbivores in their environments
some species of ceratopsians especially centrosaurus and its relatives appear to have been gregarious living in herds
this is suggested by bonebed finds with the remains of many individuals of different ages
like modern migratory herds they would have had a significant effect on their environment as well as serving as a major food source for predators
although ceratopsians are generally considered herbivorous a few paleontologists such as darren naish and mark witton have speculated online that at least some ceratopsians may have been opportunistically omnivorous
but paul and christiansen <year> argued that at least the later ceratopsians had upright forelimbs and the larger species may have been as fast as rhinos which can run at up to <num> km or <num> miles per hour
however comparisons between the scleral rings of protoceratops and psittacosaurus and modern birds and reptiles indicate that they may have been cathemeral active throughout the day at short intervals
periostitis has also been documented in the shoulder blade of a ceratopsian

glosserman 's involvement with the film began during the <year> – <year> writers guild of america strike
after glosserman signed on the breadth of the endeavor became larger
the film ended up taking an additional three years to finish after glosserman joined the production
eric koretz served as director of photography he joined the team during a shift in focus in january <year>
koretz used a panasonic ag @-@ hpx500 p2 hd camcorder
he commented to industry publication videography about the choice of technique that due to the intensity of the production team 's travel schedule tape format would not have been an option
he stated he preferred using p2 cards over the hdd @-@ based format due to its superior reliability
during the editing process glen echo entertainment utilized eight apple macintosh computers with intel processors equipped with apple 's final cut pro editing software
experts were sought out including the author of the age of american unreason susan jacoby to discuss wikipedia 's approach to scholars knowledgeable about specific subject matter
glosserman commented in an interview with indiewire we tried to get people offering compelling arguments for either side of any particular topic because our intention was to be objective and to let the viewer make up his or her own mind
the narrative structure of the film what the bleep do we know served as an inspiration for glosserman during the production process
as a non @-@ profit project the film had received more than <num> @,@ <num> in donations by march <year>

the panel discussion was moderated by the new york times journalist noam cohen and featured both co @-@ directors in addition to wikimedia foundation representative samuel klein and wikipedian in residence at the british museum liam wyatt
after the event snagfilms subsequently made the film available for free for six days to viewers in the united states
the film was screened at the savannah film festival on november <num> <year> at savannah college of art and design 's trustees theater
it was scheduled for a limited theatrical release in the united states on november <num> <year>
however wales commented negatively about the delayed release in a statement to prnewser
he said the movie was dated due to its delay
he commented that the documentary was lopsided towards reliance on expert commentary and did not feature enough weight towards depicting community involvement in the online project
wales posted to a wikimedia foundation mailing list the film was poorly received in poland and it is seriously out of date
larry sanger commented he thought the film was not too bad from what i saw
wikimedia foundation board member samuel klein commented in general i like the film a lot more after seeing it for the second time in a very different audience and seeing their live reactions
sage ross an attendee of wikimania <year> commented that the film appears to take a mainly negative point of view towards wikipedia the film gives a lot of focus to some shallow or misleading lines of criticism and on an intellectual level it comes off as largely anti @-@ wikipedia contrasting the reasonable @-@ sounding arguments of mature critics with the naive optimism of youthful wikipedians
author ted leonsis commented favorably about the documentary at his blog ted 's take characterizing it as a great film about the wikipedia movement
he concluded this is a must see film a premiere film
you gotta watch it to remain socially relevant daniel d 'addario reviewed truth in numbers everything according to wikipedia for the aol inc
publication urlesque
d 'addario commented the film raises interesting questions about authority only somewhat intentionally
he noted the dated bits observing truth in numbers may well be coming too late
d 'addario concluded his assessment by noting that at the time of his review the wikipedia article for the film was under threat of being deleted according to the site the entry for truth in numbers is being considered for deletion – it links to few other articles on the site and is an orphan
given the tenor of truth in numbers which combines avid interest in wikipedia with wide @-@ eyed dismay at much of its particulars this is either very surprising or not surprising at all
in his review for the savannah film festival carlos serrano of district wrote that though the subject matter covered a lot of ground it utilized an efficient presentation sounds like a lot to put in to one movie but the film manages to make good use of its <num> minute running time
serrano commented on the presentation of jimmy wales during the film in the end i came out of the theater thinking of him as a three @-@ dimensional figure very much a man with passion but neither completely good or evil
to be honest this is very important in a film like this and is a definite plus for the movie
serrano recommended the documentary and concluded this is definitely a solid film
this film is definitely worth a viewing
it ’ s interesting well made and presents varied perspectives on wikipedia that help the narrative stay interesting

the road proceeds through the abandoned settlement of sunrise city which was an old mining town
the roadway proceeds to the turnagain arm and turns in a westward direction
the road continues along the arm for several miles before entering the city of hope
the highway passes through hope intersecting the old hope highway and several smaller streets before exiting the town and reentering the forest
the highway reaches its northern terminus an access road to the porcupine creek campgrounds
the entire length of the hope highway is located in the chugach national forest
no portion of the highway is listed on the national highway system
the daily average vehicle count for the highway is just under <num>
the original highway connected the city of hope to moose pass which then took people to anchorage via the alaska railroad

in gameplay similar to that of the <year> super mario bros
but resized for the smaller device 's screen the player advances mario to the end of <num> levels by moving to the right and jumping across platforms to avoid enemies and pitfalls
unlike other mario games super mario land is set in sarasaland a new environment depicted in line art and mario pursues princess daisy
the game introduces two gradius @-@ style shooter levels
at nintendo ceo hiroshi yamauchi 's request game boy creator gunpei yokoi 's nintendo r d1 developed a mario game to sell the new console
it was the first portable version of mario and the first to be made without mario creator and yokoi protégé shigeru miyamoto
accordingly the development team shrunk mario gameplay elements for the device and used some elements inconsistently from the series
super mario land was expected to showcase the console until nintendo of america bundled tetris with new game boys
the game launched alongside the game boy first in japan april <year> and later worldwide
super mario land was later rereleased for the nintendo 3ds via virtual console in <year> again as a launch title which featured some tweaks to the game 's presentation
initial reviews were laudatory
reviewers were satisfied with the smaller super mario bros
but noted its short length
they considered it among the best of the game boy launch titles
the handheld console became an immediate success and super mario land ultimately sold over <num> million copies more than that of super mario bros
<num>
both contemporaneous and retrospective reviewers praised the game 's soundtrack
later reviews were critical of the compromises made in development and noted super mario land 's deviance from series norms
the game begot a series of sequels including the <year> super mario land <num> <num> golden coins <year> wario land super mario land <num> and <year> super mario 3d land though many of the original 's mechanics were not revisited
the game was included in several top game boy game lists and debuted princess daisy as a recurring mario series character
in super mario land mario travels to sarasaland to save princess daisy from tatanga an evil spaceman
two of the game 's twelve levels are forced @-@ scrolling gradius @-@ style shooters where mario helms a submarine or airplane and fires projectiles towards oncoming enemies and bosses
levels end with a platforming challenge to reach an alternative exit located above the regular exit
the former leads to a bonus minigame that awards extra lives
unlike other mario games which take place in the mushroom kingdom super mario land is set in sarasaland and drawn in line art
mario pursues princess daisy in her debut rather than the series standard damsel in distress princess peach
koopa shells explode rather than slide mario throws bouncing balls rather than fireballs <num> @-@ up mushroom power @-@ ups are depicted as hearts and the level @-@ end flagpoles are replaced with a platforming challenge
some elements recur from previous mario games such as blocks suspended in midair pipes that lead to other areas and goomba enemies
nintendo ceo hiroshi yamauchi believed that fun games sold consoles so when the company created the game boy handheld console he wanted a fun game that would feature nintendo 's mascot mario and subsequently sell consoles
the job fell to nintendo r d1 a development team led by game boy inventor gunpei yokoi
yokoi had previously created the game watch series and worked with his protégé shigeru miyamoto on the game that invented mario donkey kong
super mario land was the fourth super mario title the first portable mario game and the first in the series to be made without miyamoto
absent miyamoto 's direction the development team used elements new and inconsistent with the series as super mario land shrunk elements of the series to fit the portable device 's small screen
yokoi the head of r d1 served as producer and satoru okada served as director
they had previously developed metroid <year> and kid icarus <year> together and the two subsequently designed the game boy — yokoi on its industrial design and okada on its engineering
their super mario land was planned as the portable console 's showcase title until henk rogers brought tetris to nintendo of america and convinced minoru arakawa that the addictive computer game would help nintendo reach the largest audience
the company subsequently chose to bundle tetris with every game boy purchase
the game boy was released in japan in april <year> north america in july and europe in september <year> and super mario land was a launch title
the game 's official first released was on april <num> <year> in japan and its north american release followed in august
about <num> years later super mario land was released for the nintendo 3ds via virtual console on june <num> <year> as one of its opening titles
its added features include an increased size about <num> percent zoom and an optional shades of green color palette to match the effect of the original game boy 's monochrome
ign 's lucas thomas wrote that the protagonist enemies and overall game were shorter and noted that mario himself was just <num> pixels in height on the game boy 's small screen
with this in mind thomas was concerned about player eyestrain in rereleases of the game
still ign 's levi buchanan thought the game made no compromises in its size reduction
at the time of its release in <year> reviewers were excited to have a portable mario game
paul rand of computer and video games called the game an arcade machine in your pocket and the graphics remarkable for their size
french games magazine player one felt that super mario land adequately compromised where necessary to bring mario to a portable device
electronic gaming monthly 's steve harris considered the game fantastic and very fun to play albeit short
ed semrad and donn nauert of the same outlet both declared super mario land easily the best game boy cart of the time
complex 's gus turner wrote that the graphics were simple and official nintendo magazine said the game was ridiculously short
eurogamer reported that the game could be finished in under an hour
complex 's gus turner wrote that the game had the fun intuitiveness and difficulty associated with the series and tony mott of superplay said the game proved that nintendo 's game boy had playability to match its competitors
matt regan of mean machines agreed playability to the nth degree british magazines mean machines and the games machine both commented on the game 's number of secrets to find
eurogamer 's chris schilling called hirokazu tanaka 's soundtrack surely one of the all @-@ time greats and official nintendo magazine said it was among the greatest videogame music ever composed
player one eurogamer and complex too complimented the music
player one further pronounced super mario land a masterpiece the pinnacle of portable video gaming
following the game boy 's overnight success super mario land sold over <num> million copies — more than that of super mario bros
<num>
super mario land <num> <num> golden coins added a non @-@ linear overworld and introduced wario an evil version of mario as the game 's villain
the subsequent wario land super mario land <num> began the wario franchise
after <num> years the <year> title super mario 3d land for the nintendo 3ds became mario 's first game in stereoscopic 3d
audrey drake of ign argued that both wario land and super mario 3d land were not legitimate sequels and wrote that the latter felt more like super mario bros
<num> with mario galaxy influences than a successor to super mario land <num>
super mario land is remembered for its miniaturized super mario elements and twist on just about every mario mainstay imaginable
many of its new elements did not recur later in the series making super mario land strange compared to the rest of the series or what ign 's thomas described as a singular oddball
ign 's marc nix felt retrospectively that super mario land was the only uninspired mario game with funky voids of white and ufos instead of the strikingly original mushroom kingdom
mean machines was also put off by the alien theme easy difficulty and dot matrix screen blur
ign 's travis fahs wrote that the game was comparatively not as ambitious as super mario bros
<num>
mean machines felt as if it was not a true mario game not worth its originally high review score and in retrospect not really a classic
eurogamer 's schilling wrote that mario felt different — lighter with more friction — and that the game felt radical and distinctive for the risks it took
ign 's thomas cited out of place gameplay elements like the shooter levels exploding koopa shells non @-@ extinguishing fireballs and non @-@ princess peach plot as departures from the series
thomas attributed this to mario creator miyamoto 's lack of involvement in the game 's development which he described as famously hands @-@ off
schilling of eurogamer instead blamed the game boy 's technical limitations
but he too was perplexed by the new sphinx seahorse and moai head enemies and considered the exploding koopa shells a cruel trick disdainful of the series core gameplay
super mario land 's shooter levels new to the series were not revisited in subsequent series games
and subsequent series games such as super mario land <num> both dropped the original 's tiny scale and chose the classic fire flower fireballs over the first installment 's bouncing balls
the game was included in multiple rankings of top game boy games and official nintendo magazine listed it at <num> in its top <num> nintendo games
after her debut in super mario land princess daisy reaffiliated as luigi 's girlfriend and appears in later mario series sports and racing games
it was serialized in weekly shōnen jump from october <year> to november <year> and the chapters were published in four tankōbon volumes by shueisha from november <year> to january <year>

the story focuses on kōsaku sakamoto a high school student who goes to live with yakuza boss ibari ōzora and his four children — tsugumi tsubame hibari and suzume — after the death of his mother
kōsaku is shocked to learn that hibari who looks and behaves as a girl was assigned male at birth
eguchi wanted to create a romantic comedy manga where the main female character is a cross @-@ dressing boy so as to poke fun at the genre
he took more time to draw the chapters compared to his earlier manga and as the serialization continued he found it increasingly difficult to keep up a weekly pace for the chapters

following the conclusion of his manga hinomaru gekijō ひのまる劇場 in <year> eguchi wanted to go against the notion at the time that there was currently a golden age of romantic comedy manga in shōnen manga magazines
in response eguchi thought of creating a romantic comedy manga where the main female character is a cross @-@ dressing boy and in doing so poke fun at the genre by developing it as the antithesis of a romantic comedy
eguchi drew up the storyboard for the first chapter in about <num> minutes in a cafe and came up with the title stop hibari @-@ kun as a reference to hisashi sekiya 's manga stop nii @-@ chan ストップ にいちゃん
in wanting to highlight the comedy of having a character like hibari eguchi realized that the cuter he could draw hibari the more effective the jokes would be so he tried to draw hibari as cute as he could
eguchi had often rushed when drawing his earlier manga susume pirates すすめ パイレーツ but starting with stop hibari @-@ kun he raised the standards he held for his art and had to began taking more time to draw the chapters
in addition eguchi was very particular about the appearance of his manuscripts so he never used white @-@ out to correct any drawing errors because he disliked how it looked
as the serialization continued eguchi found it increasingly difficult to keep up a weekly pace for the chapters leading him to take frequent hiatuses and later say that drawing weekly isn 't something humans can do
furthermore the editor @-@ in @-@ chief of weekly shōnen jump at the time shigeo nishimura refused his request to release the chapters every other week
when it came time to draw what would end up being the last serialized chapter eguchi completed the chapter 's storyboard but ultimately submitted only about two @-@ thirds of the chapter leaving out the last five pages
after he submitted the chapter 's manuscript eguchi fled to a hotel and secluded himself for a day only coming out after nishimura called him to say that he could not deal with him anymore on a weekly basis
as a result eguchi abandoned the serialization and the editorial department decided to discontinue the series
stop hibari @-@ kun was serialized in the manga magazine weekly shōnen jump from the october <num> <year> issue to the november <num> <year> issue
the individual chapters were collected and published in four tankōbon volumes by shueisha from november <year> to january <year>
inspired by katsuhiro otomo eguchi fought against the established design format for the volumes that at the time was set in stone for series serialized in weekly shōnen jump
futabasha later published it in three volumes in july <year> and again in two volumes in february <year>
shueisha republished it in four volumes from may to june <year>
home @-@ sha published it in two volumes in january <year>
in an interview in <year> eguchi expressed a desire to continue some of his older series but stated that a continuation of stop hibari @-@ kun would be difficult
starting in <year> eguchi began working with shogakukan on releasing a stop hibari @-@ kun complete edition omnibus collection which features various revisions to the originally published chapters in addition to newly drawn cover art
not wanting to end the complete edition with an abrupt conclusion like he had done before eguchi found the storyboard for the final chapter and used it as a basis to newly draw the last five pages he had omitted <num> years earlier
shogakukan published the complete edition in three volumes from july <year> to february <year> shogakukan later republished the series in another three volumes from may to july <year>
in <year> eguchi did not rule out the possibility of someday drawing a continuation of the series but he said it probably would not be a story under the title stop hibari @-@ kun
it aired from may <num> <year> to january <num> <year> on fuji television
the screenplay was written by shigeru yanagawa tokio tsuchiya hiroshi toda tomomi tsutsui takeshi shudo and yumi asano
the character design used in the anime was provided by yoshinori kanemori and the music was composed by kōji nishimura
the series was later released by universal j to two dvd compilation volumes from february to march <year>
a dvd box set was released by tc entertainment in september <year>
the opening theme is stop hibari @-@ kun ストップ ひばりくん sung by yuki yukino and the ending theme is kongara connection コンガラ ・ コネクション sung by ai hoshino
manga critic haruyuki nakano has called stop hibari @-@ kun a unique and outstanding gag manga for its juxtaposition of hibari being a boy and the heir to a yakuza organization
nakano largely attributes this successful combination to eguchi 's ability to draw girls that are not only cute but also have good taste and sex appeal
the delicate touch in how hibari is drawn has been described as so attractive that it makes the reader forget that it is a gag manga
in writing for the magazine cyzo manga critic jyamao wrote that because of its overall light and pop literary style none of the indecency or immorality cross @-@ dressing may engender comes through which he surmises is why the anime was able to air during prime time
jyamao notes the more extreme nature of the jokes surrounding the yakuza characters in comparison to the jokes involving cross @-@ dressing and that some jokes such as those involving drugs would not be humorous today
manga commentator nobunaga minami lauded eguchi for being a pioneer in drawing characters with a high fashion sense in stop hibari @-@ kun which he says effectively changed fashion in shōnen manga from being seen as a symbol to now being treated as an accessory
eguchi 's attention to detail is also praised such as drawing kōsaku wearing chuck taylor all @-@ stars in one chapter
the series has been called effervescent and having had a hand in paving the way for the j @-@ pop phenomenon
when tegami bachi author hiroyuki asada read stop hibari @-@ kun in junior high school he admired its novel sensibility and eguchi 's art also influenced him
according to eguchi some people who read stop hibari @-@ kun were influenced to start cross @-@ dressing
players match notes that scroll on @-@ screen to colored fret buttons on the controller strumming the controller in time to the music in order to score points and keep the virtual audience excited
the games attempt to mimic many features of playing a real guitar including the use of fast @-@ fingering hammer @-@ ons and pull @-@ offs and the use of the whammy bar to alter the pitch of notes
most games support single player modes typically a career mode to play through all the songs in the game and both competitive and cooperative multiplayer modes
with the introduction of guitar hero world tour in <year> the game includes support for a four @-@ player band including vocals and drums
the series initially used mostly cover versions of songs created by wavegroup sound but most recent titles feature soundtracks that are fully master recordings and in some cases special re @-@ recordings of the songs
later titles in the series feature support for downloadable content in the form of new songs
in <year> redoctane a company specializing in the manufacture of unique game controllers was inspired to create guitar hero based on redoctane 's experience creating hardware for konami 's guitar freaks arcade game
they enlisted harmonix who previously developed several music video games for development assistance
the first game in the series was made on a budget of <num> million
the series became extremely successful leading to the acquisition of redoctane by activision in <year>
harmonix was acquired by mtv games and went on to create the rock band series of music games in the same vein as guitar hero
activision brought neversoft primarily known for their tony hawk series of skateboarding games on board for future development duties
additional companies such as budcat creations and vicarious visions have assisted in the adaptation of the games for other systems
the series currently has eight major releases six guitar hero games two dj hero games and band hero and five expansions on gaming consoles
there are spin @-@ offs for windows and macintosh systems mobile phones the nintendo ds the guitar hero on tour series and an arcade game
the guitar hero franchise was a primary brand during the emergence of the popularity of rhythm games as a cultural phenomenon in north america
such games have been utilized as a learning and development tool for medical purposes
the first game in the series was considered by several journalists to be one of the most influential video games of the first decade of the 21st century
the series has sold more than <num> million units worldwide earning us <num> billion at retail claimed by activision to be the <num> largest game franchise after the mario and madden nfl franchises the third main title of the series guitar hero iii legends of rock is also claimed by activision to be the first single video game title to exceed <num> billion in sales
despite early success the series along with the overall rhythm game genre suffered from poor sales starting in <year>
activision had stated in early <year> that the series was on hiatus for <year> while a seventh main title in the series was under development this title was later cancelled due to the poor quality of the emerging product
activision later shut down sales of the series downloadable content although users who purchased material from it previously may still play what they bought
in <year> activision announced the first new title to the series in <num> years guitar hero live released in october <year>
the title is considered a reboot of the series with development being performed by freestylegames who had developed the dj hero games previously
redoctane was seeking to bring in a guitar freaks @-@ like game highly popular in japan at the time into western markets and approached harmonix about helping them to develop a music game involving a guitar controller
both companies agreed to it and went on to produce guitar hero in <year>
the title was highly successful leading to the development of its successful sequel guitar hero ii in <year>
while the original controllers for the first guitar hero game were designed by ryan lesser rob kay greg lopiccolo and alex rigopulous of harmonix and built by the honeybee corporation of china subsequent iterations and future controllers were developed inhouse at redoctane with development led primarily by jack mccauley
redoctane was bought by activision in june — who spent us <num> million to acquire the guitar hero franchise — while it was announced in october that harmonix would be purchased by mtv networks
as a result of the two purchases harmonix would no longer develop future games in the guitar hero series
instead that responsibility would go to neversoft a subsidiary of activision known for developing the tony hawk 's series of skateboarding games
neversoft was chosen to helm the guitar hero series after neversoft founder joel jewett admitted to the redoctane founders kai and charles huang that his development team for tony hawk 's project <num> went to work on weekends just to play guitar hero
activision ceo bobby kotick believed that neversoft would help them bring great games to the series but on reflection stated that had activision explored harmonix further as a continued developer for the series things may have turned out differently
in addition activision began seeking other markets for the game a nintendo ds version of the series was developed by vicarious visions while a guitar hero mobile series was created for mobile phones
the company also began considering the expansion of the series to band @-@ specific titles with guitar hero aerosmith
later in november <year> activision acquired budcat creations another development studio that had helped with the playstation <num> versions of guitar hero iii and world tour announcing that they would be helping to develop another game in the guitar hero series
in <year> harmonix and mtv games released a new music title through rival publisher electronic arts called rock band
it expanded upon the gameplay popularized by the guitar hero series by adding drum and microphone instruments allowing players to simulate playing songs as bands
activision followed suit with the release of guitar hero world tour in <year> which supported multiple instruments
in <year> activision tripled its guitar hero offerings and in addition to further continuation of the existing main series with guitar hero <num> and expansions they introduced the titles band hero geared towards more family @-@ friendly pop music and dj hero a game based on turntablism and featuring a number of mixes
with the release of guitar hero <num> activision considered the series to have moved away from its heavy metal basis into a broader selection of music
guitar hero <num> is the first game in the series to use a new version of the series logo previous games used a logo in a font with sharper points on the letters which was considered idiosyncratic with a vengeance to match the games emphasis on heavy metal music
activision used the services of the pentagram design studio to refashion the game 's logo
pentagram developed a new font removing some of the aggressive odd features to make the typeface more suitable and amendable to design feature incorporation to other games such as band hero and dj hero
activision announced it would be cutting back to only <num> skus within <year> instead of the <num> in <year>
though redoctane and neversoft continued to develop the <num> main game guitar hero warriors of rock until its completion both studios were later shuttered by activision moving key personnel into activision directly for future game development and in the case of neversoft closing its guitar hero division while transferring future development duties for the series to vicarious visions another activision studio which had been fundamental in building the wii and nintendo ds versions of the games
in november <year> activision also closed budcat creations the arm of the publisher that was primarily responsible for porting the guitar hero games to the playstation <num>
ahead of activision 's <year> fourth quarter financial report in february <year> activision disbanded its guitar hero business unit and announced that it would cease development of the planned <year> guitar hero game
activision cited continued declines in the music genre to explain its decision
the closure also affected the dj hero series as activision stated that there were no plans to publish a music game during <year>
activision 's vice president dan winters later clarified that the company was just putting guitar hero on hiatus and that they were just not making a new game for next year that 's all
in a july <year> interview with forbes kotick stated that while the publisher was going to stop selling guitar hero altogether they were going to go back to the studios and we ’ re going to use new studios and reinvent the series but a former teammember of vicarious visions has stated that as of <year> all development of guitar hero has come to an end within activision
another source close to vicarious visions had reported to kotaku that while guitar hero <num> was in development under an activision studio the game was considered a disaster
the cancelled game omitted the additional instruments and used only a guitar peripheral redesigning the unit to include a <num> @-@ button mechanism replacing the strum bar the resulting unit was considered too expensive to manufacture and purchase
the developers had also started the game development from scratch to try to create new characters and venues that would be more reactive to the actual songs being played to give the feel of a music video but ultimately this proved too much of a challenge and had to be scrapped
further with a limited budget the song selection was limited to low @-@ budget hits of the <num> or at times reusing songs that had previously been included in guitar hero games
though the team had a two @-@ year development cycle it was closed down after activision president eric hirshber had seen the current state of the project at the one @-@ year point
another potential guitar hero project was discovered by the archival site unseen64 for a game titled hero world a massively multiplayer online game that would link the guitar hero and dj hero games
the game had been developed by freestyle games sometime after the release of dj hero <num> with the main development duties passed to virtual fairground using their platform the ride an adobe flash @-@ based platform that would let the game be played in a web browser
the game was cancelled in <year> along with other pending guitar hero projects
no further downloadable content for either guitar hero or dj hero was made after february <year> though activision committed to releasing content that was already in development by that time due to fan response later in a move described by game informer as the final nail in the series coffins activision announced it would discontinue all dlc sales for the series although customers can still play tracks they have already bought as of march <num> <year>
though activision had moved away from the guitar hero series the lessons learned helped them and developer toys for bob to handle the manufacturing and outsourcing issues that came with the highly successful skylanders toy and video game franchise
the title was developed by activision 's internal studio freestylegames who previously had worked on the dj hero spinoff titles
freestylegames were given free reign to reboot the guitar hero series for next @-@ generation consoles
one of their first innovations was to drop the standard five @-@ button guitar controller ultimately designing a six @-@ button guitar controller with two rows of three buttons each allowing them to mimic actual guitar fingering
guitar hero live was released with both career and an online mode
the career mode used full @-@ motion video taken from the perspective of a lead guitarist underneath the note highway to create an immersive experience to the player
the online mode called ghtv discarded the previous downloadable content approach and used a music video channel approach to stream playable songs to players adding new songs to the catalog on a weekly basis
the game was released in october <year>
though the game was praised as a reinvention of the guitar hero series the game did not sell as well as activision expected due to lowered forecasts activision let go of a significant fraction of freestylegames developers
guitar hero is notable because it comes packaged with a controller peripheral modeled after a black gibson sg guitar
rather than a typical gamepad this guitar controller is the primary input for the game
playing the game with the guitar controller simulates playing an actual guitar except it uses five colored fret buttons and a strum bar instead of frets and strings
the development of guitar hero was inspired by konami 's guitar freaks video game which at the time had not seen much exposure in the north american market redoctane already selling guitar @-@ shaped controllers for imported copies of guitarfreaks approached harmonix about creating a game to use an entirely new guitar controller
the concept was to have the gameplay of amplitude with the visuals of karaoke revolution both of which had been developed by harmonix
the game was met with critical acclaim and received numerous awards for its innovative guitar peripheral and its soundtrack which comprised <num> playable rock songs most of which were cover versions of popular songs from artists and bands from the <num> through modern rock

in addition metallica 's album death magnetic was available as downloadable content for guitar hero iii simultaneously with the release of the album with the content being forward @-@ compatible with guitar hero world tour and guitar hero metallica
since the playstation <num> version does not support downloading three extra songs were included from death magnetic and are as follows broken beat and scarred cyanide and my apocalypse

dj hero uses a special turntable @-@ based controller for players to perform with on various song mixes in the game

guitar hero on tour was developed by vicarious visions who also ported the guitar hero games to nintendo 's wii console
a sequel guitar hero on tour decades was released in november <year> featuring music spanning four decades
a third title in the series guitar hero on tour modern hits was announced following various rumors of its existence and was released in june <year> featuring songs recorded since the year <year>
both games use the guitar grip controller and allow two players to compete against each other using any version of the on tour series with songs being shared between versions
band hero was also ported to the nintendo ds by vicarious visions expanding the play to include vocals through the ds microphone and drumming
the drumming uses a special drum skin adapter designed for the nintendo ds lite to map the unit 's face buttons to four drum pads
however the peripheral is not compatible with the original nintendo ds model or the nintendo dsi
however since the drum skin is not electronic but a rubber cover switch that duplicates certain buttons on the ds lite a player can simply press the buttons in time to play the drums
the game includes four @-@ player local wireless play in a similar manner as guitar hero <num> allowing any combination of instruments to be used
the game has a set of <num> songs some are from band hero and others are from several guitar hero games set lists
guitar hero on tour does not work on the nintendo dsi and nintendo 3ds because unlike the nintendo ds they do not have game boy advance slots
band hero is limited to vocals and drums on the two consoles for the same reason
the base version of the game includes <num> songs from both guitar hero ii and guitar hero iii and has released a three @-@ song add @-@ on pack every month since january <year>
the title has been downloaded by users one million times with both verizon and hands @-@ on mobile claiming that over <num> @,@ <num> songs are played a day on the platform
the two companies produced two other mobile @-@ based guitar hero games guitar hero iii backstage pass released in july <year> adds role @-@ playing elements to manage the band 's success in addition to the core rhythm game while the mobile version of guitar hero world tour released in december <year> expands each included track for play on both lead guitar and drums mimicking the expansion of the console series to the full band
glu mobile developed the mobile version of guitar hero <num> released in the last quarter of <year>
to produce guitar hero carabiner a handheld electronic game that features <num> and <num> @-@ second clips of ten of the songs from guitar hero and guitar hero ii
activision and konami who had previously worked together to make sure that the guitar hero series meets with konami 's patents on music games developed an arcade console version of the game titled guitar hero arcade distributed to arcades in early <year>
the game is completely based on the guitar hero iii gameplay but reducing some of the features such as the use of the whammy bar star power button star power may only be activated by lifting the guitar and practice modes but keeping the ability to download new songs for the cabinet from the internet
the arcade game has come under some scrutiny by the american society of composers authors and publishers ascap who believe the use of the game in arcades is equivalent to public performances and seek additional fees to be paid by operators of the game
it was expected that the <year> entry for guitar hero warriors of rock would be the final entry developed by neversoft based on claims that neversoft would be letting go of its guitar hero division with vicarious visions likely poised to take over future development
further industry rumors pointed at the closure of redoctane studios and underground development the development studio for guitar hero van halen as further results from the scaling @-@ back activision moved the controller hardware development within their own division to continue to support the series with redoctane founders kai and charles huang remaining with activision
a week prior to these announcements the guitar hero division ceo at activision dan rosensweig left the company leading to some speculation on whether rosensweig 's departure influenced these changes
activision and redoctane had trademarked the titles guitar villain drum villain keyboard hero and sing hero
redoctane originally trademarked the titles drum hero and band hero but the work performed towards the drum hero title was eventually folded into the gameplay for guitar hero world tour and band hero became its own game
later as of october <year> activision reapplied for a drum hero trademark
pi studios which had previously helped to port rock band to the wii had started work on the karaoke title sing hero before activision cancelled its development
dave mustaine frontman for megadeth stated he had been in talks with activision and neversoft for a guitar hero @-@ related product
it was later revealed that dave mustaine was working with activision for music in guitar hero warriors of rock including an original track sudden death recorded specifically for the game
two guitar hero products that were announced but never released were a red hot chili peppers @-@ themed title and a playstation portable title that would have featured a drum component
the guitar controller is recommended for play although a standard console controller can be used instead
however the guitar controller has been required for play ever since the inclusion of drum and vocal parts in the series
the game supports toggling the handedness of the guitar allowing both left @-@ handed and right @-@ handed players to utilize the guitar controller
while playing the game an extended guitar neck is shown vertically on the screen the frets horizontal often called the note highway and as the song progresses colored markers or gems indicating notes travel down the screen in time with the music the note colors and positions match those of the five fret keys on the guitar controller
once the note s reach the bottom the player must play the indicated note s by holding down the correct fret button s and hitting the strumming bar in order to score points
success or failure will cause the on @-@ screen rock meter to change showing how well the player is playing denoted by red yellow and green sections
should the rock meter drop below the red section the song will automatically end with the player booed off the stage by the audience
successful note hits will add to the player 's score and by hitting a long series of consecutive successful note hits the player can increase their score multiplier
there is a window of time for hitting each note similar to other rhythm games such as dance dance revolution but unlike these games scoring in guitar hero is not affected by accuracy as long as the note is hit within that window the player receives the same number of points
selected special segments of the song will have glowing notes outlined by stars successfully hitting all notes in this series will fill the star power meter
the star power meter can also be filled by using the whammy bar during sustained notes within these segments
once the star power meter is at least half full the player can activate star power by pressing the select button or momentarily lifting the guitar into a vertical position
when star power is activated the scoring multiplier is doubled until star power is depleted
the rock meter also increases more dramatically when star power is activated making it easier for the player to make the rock meter stay at a high level
thus star power can be used strategically to play difficult sections of a song that otherwise might cause the player to fail
in the earlier entries of the series up until guitar hero aerosmith activating star power meant that players could not accrue more star power until the star power meter was fully drained and the effect ended
starting with guitar hero world tour more star power can be collected even if the effect is active by completing more star power phrases extending the star power 's duration by doing so
when playing in cooperative play with a bassist rhythm guitarist in guitar hero ii through guitar hero aerosmith or as a band in guitar hero world tour star power is shared between all the players and activation of star power is dependent on all players simultaneously activating it
notes can be a single note or composed of two to five notes that make a chord
both single notes and chords can also be sustained indicated by a colored line following the note marker the player can hold the sustained note s keys down for the entire length for additional points
during a sustained note a player may use the whammy bar on the guitar to alter the tone of the note
also regardless of whether sustains are hit early or late if the fret is held for the full duration of the hold the game will always award the same amount of score increase for the note
in addition the games support virtual implementations of hammer @-@ ons and pull @-@ offs guitar @-@ playing techniques that are used to successfully play a fast series of notes by only changing the fingering on the fret buttons without having to strum each note
sequences where strumming is not required are indicated on @-@ screen by notes with a white outline at the top of the marker instead of the usual black one with guitar hero iii legends of rock adding a white @-@ glowing effect to make these notes clearer
guitar hero world tour features transparent notes that are connected by a purple outline players may either simply tap the correct fret for these notes without strumming or utilize a touchpad on world tour 's guitar controller to mimic the slide technique
in addition notes can now be played while a sustained note is being played
world tour also adds an open string note for bass players represented by a line across the fret instead of any note gems that is played by strumming without holding down any fret buttons the sixth installment warriors of rock features an open note sustain for bass instruments as well
guitar hero world tour introduced drums and vocal tracks in addition to lead and bass guitar
drum tracks are played similar to guitar tracks the player must strike the appropriate drum head or step down on the bass drum pedal on the controller when the note gems pass the indicated line
certain note gems when using a drum controller that is velocity @-@ sensitive are armored requiring the player to hit the indicated drum pad harder to score more points
vocal tracks are played similar to games such as karaoke revolution where the player must match the pitch and the pacing of the lyrics to score points
guitar hero <num> allows players to create a band of up to four players using any combination of instruments
while the song is playing the background visuals feature the players chosen avatar along with the rest of the band performing in one of several real and fictional venues
the reaction of the audience is based on the performance of the player judged by the rock meter
guitar hero ii added special lighting and other stage effects that were synchronized to the music to provide a more complete concert experience
the games developed by neversoft feature a simple storyline usually about a band 's quest for fame which is told through animations played throughout the game
these animations were created by chris prynoski and his studio titmouse inc
who have also done animations for the animated show metalocalypse
it is by completing songs in this mode that the songs are unlocked for play across the rest of the game
players can choose their on @-@ stage character their guitar of choice and the venue in which they wish to play
in this mode the player can earn money from his her performances that is redeemable at the in @-@ game store where bonus songs additional guitars and finishes your characters clothing and bonus content can be unlocked
quick play mode is a quicker method of playing songs as it allows the player to select a track and difficulty selecting the character venue and guitar and guitar skin for the player based on the song chosen
after successfully completing a song the player is given a score a percentage of how many notes they hit and a rating from three to five stars and two in rare cases depending on his her final score on the song with money being awarded in guitar hero world tour
the games have also added multiplayer modes
cooperative modes allow two players to play lead and either bass or rhythm guitar on the same song working together towards the same score
a competitive face @-@ off mode allows two players to play against each other at different difficulty levels each attempting to earn the best score on a song
each player plays different portions of the song
there is also a pro face @-@ off mode where two players battle at the same difficulty level
unlike standard face @-@ off each player attempts to play all of the notes in a song while still trying to earn the highest score
in guitar hero world tour this was advanced on as players could play a pro face @-@ off game against each other on any difficulty level the lower your difficulty the more points were awarded so a player on a low difficulty could potentially beat a player on a more challenging difficulty
guitar hero iii introduced boss battles in which two players face off against each other attempt to collect distractions to throw at their opponent trying to make them fail
with guitar hero world tour up to four players can play cooperatively on lead and bass guitar drums and vocals while a total of eight players can compete in a battle of the bands
the xbox <num> playstation <num> and wii versions of the games support multiplayer modes over their respective network services
the four difficulty levels for each song afford the player a learning curve in order to help him her progress in skill
the first difficulty level easy only focuses on the first three fret buttons while displaying a significantly reduced amount of notes for the player to play
medium introduces the fourth blue fret button and hard includes the final fret button while adding additional notes
the addition of the orange fret button forces players to move their fingers up and down the neck
expert does not introduce any other frets to learn but adds more notes in a manner designed to challenge the player and to simulate the player 's hands to move in a sequence similar to a real guitar
a difficulty added in world tour is beginner which only requires the player to strum to the basic rhythm holding the fret buttons becomes unnecessary
another new difficulty only for drums was added to metallica known as expert which uses the double bass pedal
guitar hero warriors of rock is the sixth installment in the franchise and introduced a new take on the career mode of previous games
rather than being a quest for fame and glory with the band travelling through different venues warriors of rock features the quest mode as the primary campaign mode
quest mode tells the story of an ancient warrior who was defeated by a powerful monster and his mystical guitar was lost
the player must amass a team of rockers to help recover this guitar and defeat the monster called the beast
as the player progresses through the mode the rockers joining them will transform based on the number of stars earned from songs played
these transformations will empower the player with extra abilities in a song such as constant score multipliers or star power bonuses
these abilities are each unique to the individual rockers and by using them effectively it is possible now to earn up to forty stars for a single song
a certain number of characters are available at the start of the game but the player must spend in @-@ game money earned by successful performances to unlock other characters
many of the characters reappear throughout the series with the character roster changing as new characters are added or removed
standby characters that have appeared in nearly all the games include the metalhead axel steel extreme viking thrash metalhead lars ümlaut punk rocker johnny napalm alternative rocker judy nails and hard rocker casey lynch
the developers utilized these characters in more detail within warriors of rock where each was given a unique setlist and venue based on their musical style as well as a unique power within the game 's quest mode
several games in the series feature caricatures of celebrity artists such as slash tom morello and bret michaels in guitar hero iii ozzy osbourne and jimi hendrix in world tour kurt cobain in guitar hero <num> and taylor swift and the band no doubt in band hero
the band @-@ specific games aerosmith metallica and van halen also feature the members of the respective bands
however in late <year> both courtney love and the members of no doubt sought legal action against activision for the misuse of their in @-@ game characters singing or performing songs by other artists which the musicians believe fell outside of their contract
the ability for the players to create their own avatars was added in guitar hero world tour and was based on neversoft 's existing character creation tools from the tony hawk series
later games on the xbox <num> and wii allowed players to use the respective console 's avatars as members of the band
in addition to unlocking characters in @-@ game money can be used to buy clothing accessories and instruments that they are seen playing with
the guitars can also be customized with special finishes purchasable through the in @-@ game store
guitar hero world tour includes the ability to fully customize any component of the guitar
the in @-@ game store in the series is also used to unlock bonus songs or special videos with interviews about the game or with the artists involved
guitar hero encore rocks the <num> features songs primarily from the <num> while guitar hero aerosmith metallica and van halen feature music from the respective bands and groups that inspired or worked with the bands
songs with profanities have been censored
many of the guitar hero games developed for the recent generation of consoles xbox <num> playstation <num> and wii support downloadable content allowing players to purchase new songs to play in the respective titles
songs each cost approximately <num> through the various online stores for the console 's platform
prior to guitar hero <num> downloadable content for earlier games will not work in other games in the series save for songs from metallica 's death magnetic which were available for guitar hero iii world tour and metallica
existing world tour downloadable content for world tour will be forward @-@ compatible with guitar hero <num> band hero and guitar hero warriors of rock and for a small fee some songs from both guitar hero world tour and guitar hero smash hits can be exported to both guitar hero <num> and band hero limited by music licensing
activision has also stated that they are considering a monthly subscription service to deliver downloadable content to user for future games
guitar hero world tour introduced a music creation mode that will allow players to create and share songs excluding vocals via the ghtunes service which was also used in all other guitar hero games and band hero since its inclusion
the creation tools were improved with guitar hero <num> and band hero to allow longer songs and other means of generating songs in real @-@ time
in the first two games and the <year> expansion guitar hero encore rocks the <num> the majority of the songs on the main career mode set lists are covers of the original song for example a song may be presented as free bird as made famous by lynyrd skynyrd
guitar hero iii legends of rock introduces a much larger range of original recordings and world tour featured a setlist that contained all master recordings
the covers throughout the games are mostly recreated by wavegroup sound who has worked before to create songs for beatmania dance dance revolution and karaoke revolution making small changes to the guitar portions to make them more adaptable for gameplay
almost all of the unlockable bonus songs are songs performed by the original artist for the game the only exception is the song she bangs the drums by the stone roses which is featured in guitar hero iii legends of rock
prior to the release of guitar hero iii legends of rock activision worked with the itunes store to provide more than <num> tracks of guitar hero @-@ related music across more than <num> compilations including most of the tracks from the games in the series called guitar hero essentials
these compilations such as killer guitar solos and guitar anthems of the <num> include songs related to but not contained within the guitar hero series
dusty welch of redoctane stated where there ’ s music there ’ s guitar hero and with itunes we are able to provide fans with a central location for downloading their favorite rock anthems
following the merger of activision and blizzard the new company announced that it planned on creating an alternative to itunes based on the guitar hero brand that would allow for downloading songs and their associated note tracks for the guitar hero games
the initial games were highly praised by reviewers
neversoft 's first entry to the series guitar hero iii was considered to be too difficult with many difficult songs presenting players with walls of notes the developers later acknowledged this
subsequent efforts in guitar hero aerosmith and guitar hero world tour were seen to have some improvements with guitar hero metallica considered to be a well @-@ polished title and at that time the best guitar hero title neversoft has produced
guitar hero <num> 's improvements toward social gameplay were complemented by reviewers and considered a further improvement upon the series
entertainment weekly put it on its end @-@ of @-@ the @-@ decade best @-@ of list saying an addictive videogame provides the illusion of musical mastery for even the least gifted

overall the guitar hero series has sold more than <num> million units worldwide earning us <num> billion at retail
activision claimed the series to be the <num> largest game franchise in <year> after the mario and madden nfl franchises
the series has helped to rekindle music education in children influenced changes in both the video game and music industry has found use in health and treatment of recovering patients and has become part of the popular culture vernacular
several journalists including 1up
com wired g4tv the san jose mercury news inc
the guardian and advertising age considered guitar hero to be one of the most influential products of the first decade of the 21st century attributing it as the spark leading to the growth of the rhythm game market for boosting music sales for both new and old artists for introducing more social gaming concepts to the video game market and in conjunction with the wii for improving interactivity with gaming consoles
while guitar hero and guitar hero ii are fully backward @-@ compatible through the hardware playstation <num> emulation in the initial north american release of the console it was impossible at launch to use the guitar controller to play either game
kai huang of redoctane states that they are working on that with sony right now – looking at how we can get all the playstation <num> guitars that are out there and all the owners of them to use them on the playstation <num>
nyko an accessories company was poised to make a special playstation <num> controller adapter for the playstation <num> but put the product on hold due to technical difficulties

however the may <year> playstation <num> v1

patent <num> @,@ <num> @,@ <num>
gibson claimed that this covers technology that simulates a concert performance via pre @-@ recorded audio and a musical instrument
in response activision filed a suit seeking a declaration that it was not in violation of the gibson patent activision also asserted that gibson had given an implied license by waiting to assert the patent and that the patent was invalid
on march <num> <year> gibson sued six retailers gamestop amazon
com wal @-@ mart target toys r us and kmart for selling guitar hero products
subsequently on march <num> <year> gibson also filed a lawsuit against ea mtv and harmonix over their game rock band also for violation of its patent to which a harmonix spokesperson stated that gibson 's claims are completely without merit
activision lawyer mary tuck stated in their legal filings that they believe that gibson initiated the lawsuit due to the fact that activision was not interested in renewing the license and marketing support agreement with gibson guitars
in february <year> the united states district court for the central district of california ruled against gibson in their case against activision stating that the controllers are not musical instruments but toys that represent other items and that gibson 's patent only covers instruments that send out analog signals
activision and gibson settled the suit following this ruling
activision through john devecka owns all of devecka enterprises us and international patents that deal with music games
all patents issued by the uspto are presumed valid
in february <year> activision was sued by the patent compliance group pcg for releasing guitar hero products with false patent claims with the pcg asserting that games like guitar hero <num> and band hero were marked with up to <num> patents that are not used within the games along with several other improper patent pending claims
pcg claims that acts of false marketing deter innovation and stifle competition in the marketplace
pcg 's qui tam lawsuit is seeking up to <num> per unit sold if activision is found liable
parappa the rapper creator masaya matsuura stated that the video game market was growing stale and needed to move beyond games that simply challenge the player to mimic the playing of licensed music
ryan geddes of ign stated that he hit the wall with play @-@ along music games and challenged the game makers to explore other ways to combine music and video games
analysts stated that such games must continue to innovate instead of just providing more songs in order to prevent genre fatigue
jesse divnich of electronic entertainment and design research commented that much like dance dance revolution guitar hero and other music games explosively grew initially due to significant new features from other games but have become stagnant due to focusing on content over features and suggested that for the genre to continue to grow they must look to incremental changes as done with the first @-@ person shooter genre
former ceo for redoctane kelly sumner believed that activision abused the series as they tried to get too much out of the franchise too quickly
the series has also been criticized for its release model in contrast to the rock band series causing some players to hold contempt towards activision
harmonix considered the rock band series as a music platform and supported it with downloadable content and the ability to import songs from its games and expansions into most other games of the series
critics argued that guitar hero should have been doing the same either through releasing expansions that could be incorporated into the main games of the series or by issuing the songs as downloadable content
the release of guitar hero smash hits reworking older songs from the series to full four @-@ instrument band support but otherwise adding no additional material was called the definition of milking by reviewers with no observable technical limitation as to why the songs could not be added as downloadable content
ars technica recognized that licensing issues might have limited when songs from one single game could be played in others of the series such as the case for the beatles rock band but that such cross @-@ compatibility should have been a high priority for rhythm games
furthermore some expansions were praised for the additional content beyond the note @-@ matching gameplay guitar hero metallica is considered to be one of the series best works to be developed by neversoft in part due to the care that the developers took with imaging the band and the available extras for the game
activision later revealed that both guitar hero <num> and band hero would support playing songs from both guitar hero world tour both on @-@ disc and downloadable content and guitar hero smash hits with music licensing being the only limiting factor on which songs could be made forward @-@ compatible
the large number of guitar hero and rock band titles on the market is considered to be partially responsible for the sharp decline of music game sales in the latter half of <year> along with the effects of the late @-@ <num> recession
the market for rhythm games was <num>
<num> billion in <year> but dropped to <num> million in <year> even though more titles were available that year
former neversoft project director brian bright noted that at one point in <year> they were responsible for the release of three games that year guitar hero <num> metallica and band hero and supporting other studios for the development of two additional games causing the studio to lose focus both in development and marketing efforts
according to bright sales of all the guitar hero games released in <year> totaled the number of sales of the <year> title world tour demonstrating the dilution of the marketing
though activision had originally planned on tripling the offerings of the guitar hero series in <year> the company readjusted their plans reducing the number of offerings and focusing more on selling digital downloadable content for the series
only two titles guitar hero warriors of rock and dj hero <num> were released in <year> both scheduled for the back half of <year>
analysts believe that the market will evolve to support a smaller number of titles each year averaging at a healthy value <num> – <num> million in revenues annually
kotick believed that part of the downfall of guitar hero was due to activision 's introduction of dj hero which they gave too much focus and left the core guitar hero games without the nourishment and care needed to continue to innovate in the series
activision publishing chief executive mike griffith in response to questions about activision 's approach to the guitar hero market noted that guitar hero continues to outsell the rock band series in both number of sales and revenue with consumers continuing to buy the separate games on the market and considered the market acceptance of the multiple games as validation for their model
regardless after releasing <num> different skus between games and bundle packages in <year> activision opted to reduce that number to <num> in <year> recognizing the music game genre was not as profitable as it once was
activision later opted to put future development of the series on hold in early <year> citing weak sales in the rhythm game genre a move that many journalists attributed to activision 's earlier oversaturation
it breeds in woodland and scrub in northern europe and asia
it is strongly migratory with many northern birds moving south during the winter
it is a very rare breeder in the british isles but winters in large numbers in the united kingdom southern europe north africa and the middle east
it is omnivorous eating a wide range of molluscs insects and earthworms in the summer and berries grain and seeds in the winter
fieldfares often nest in small colonies possibly for protection from predators
the nest is built in a tree where five or six eggs are laid
the chicks are fed by both parents and leave the nest after a fortnight
there may be two broods in southern parts of the range but only one further north
migrating birds and wintering birds often form large flocks often in the company of redwings
the fieldfare is <num> cm <num> in long with a grey crown neck and rump a plain brown back dark wings and tail and white underwings
the breast and flanks are heavily spotted
the breast has a reddish wash and the rest of the underparts are white
the sexes are similar in appearance but the females are slightly more brown
the male has a simple chattering song and the birds have various guttural flight and alarm calls
the anglo @-@ saxon word feldefare perhaps meant traveller through the fields
the species was described by linnaeus in his systema naturae <year> under its current scientific name
the name turdus pilaris comes from two separate latin words for thrush
no subspecies are recognised
in flight its white under wing @-@ coverts and axillaries are conspicuous
the harsh flight call tsak tsak is also distinctive
the forehead and crown of the male are bluish @-@ grey and each feather has a central brownish @-@ black band

the chin throat and upper breast are creamy @-@ buff with bold streaks and speckles of brownish @-@ black
the lower breast is creamy @-@ white with a diminishing buff tinge and fewer speckles and the belly is similarly creamy @-@ white with the speckles restricted to the uppermost parts
the primaries are brownish @-@ black with the leading edge fringed grey and the inner edge of the outer feathers grey near the base whereas the inner feathers are fringed with brown near the base
the secondaries are similar but fringed with chestnut @-@ brown on the leading edge
the upper wing @-@ coverts are brownish @-@ black and similar to the outer primaries in their margin colouration
the axillaries and under wing @-@ coverts are white and the under tail @-@ coverts have dark greyish @-@ brown bases and margins and white centres and tips
the beak is strong with a slight curve and a notch near the tip
it is orange @-@ yellow in winter with the upper mandible somewhat brownish and both mandible tips brownish @-@ black
in the summer both mandibles of the male 's beak are yellow
the irises are dark brown and the legs and feet are brown
the average adult length is <num> cm <num>
<num> in the winglength is <num>
<num> cm <num>
<num> in and the tarsal length <num>
<num> cm <num>
<num> in
the female is very similar to the male but the upper parts are somewhat more brownish and the feathers on the crown have narrower black central stripes
the throat and breast are paler with fewer smaller markings
the beak is similar to the male 's winter beak
the juvenile are a duller colour than the adults with pale coloured streaks on the feathers that have dark streaks in the adult
the young assume their adult plumage after their first moult in the autumn
the call is mostly uttered in flight and is a harsh tsak tsak tsuk
the same sound but softer is made more conversationally when individuals gather in trees
when angry or alarmed they emit various warning sounds reminiscent of the mistle thrush turdus viscivorous
the male has a rather feeble song that he sings in the breeding season
it is a mixture of a few phrases like those of the common blackbird turdus merula interspersed with whistles guttural squeaks and call notes
this is sung on the wing and also from a tree and a subdued version of this song with more warbling notes is sung by a group of birds at communal roosts
it breeds in northern norway northern sweden finland belgium germany switzerland austria the czech republic slovakia hungary poland and siberia as far east as transbaikal the aldan river and the tian shan mountains in north west china
its winter range extends through west and south europe to north africa though it is uncommon in the mediterranean region
eastern populations migrate to anatolia israel iran and northwest india and occasionally northeast india
it is a vagrant to iceland greenland spitsbergen the canary islands the balearic islands madeira corsica sardinia sicily malta and cyprus
in the summer the fieldfare frequents mixed woodland of birch alder pine spruce and fir often near marshes moorland or other open ground
it does not avoid the vicinity of humans and can be seen in cultivated areas orchards parks and gardens
it also inhabits open tundra and the slopes of hills above the tree line
in the winter groups of fieldfares are chiefly found in open country agricultural land orchards and open woodland
they are nomadic wandering wherever there is an abundance of berries and insects
later in the year they move on to pastureland and cultivated fields
it takes several strong beats then closes its wings briefly before flapping on
it is highly gregarious quite shy and easily scared in the winter and bold and noisy in the breeding season
when a group is in a tree they all tend to face in the same direction keeping up a constant chatter
when foraging on the ground often in association with redwings the group works its way up wind each bird pausing every so often to stand erect and gaze around before resuming feeding
when alarmed they fly off down wind and the feeding group reforms elsewhere
in woodland they do not skulk in the undergrowth as do blackbirds or song thrushes instead they perch in the open on bushes and high branches
they roost socially sometimes in overgrown hedges and shrubberies but usually on the ground
common sites are in rough grass among bushes or clumps of rushes in young plantations on stubble and in the furrows of ploughed fields
migration southwards from the breeding range starts in october but the bulk of birds arrive in the united kingdom in november
some of these are still on passage and carry on into continental europe but others remain
the passage @-@ migrants return in april and they and the resident migrants depart from the united kingdom mostly by early may
the fieldfare is omnivorous
animal food in the diet includes snails and slugs earthworms spiders and insects such as beetles and their larvae flies and grasshoppers
when berries ripen in the autumn these are taken in great number
hawthorn holly rowan yew juniper dog rose cotoneaster pyracantha and berberis are all relished
later in the winter windfall apples are eaten swedes attacked in the field and grain and seeds eaten
when these are exhausted or in particularly harsh weather the birds may move to marshes or even the foreshore where molluscs are to be found
the female fieldfare builds a cup @-@ shaped nest with no attempt at concealment
the location is often in woodland but may be in a hedgerow garden among rocks in a pile of logs in a hut or on the ground
fieldfares usually nest in close proximity to others of the same species
the adults will defend the nest aggressively and nesting gregariously may offer protection from predators
the nest is built of dried grasses and weeds with a few twigs and a little moss with a lining of mud and an inner lining of fine grasses
there are usually five to six eggs in a clutch but occasionally three four seven or eight eggs are laid
the eggs vary in size from <num>
<num> by <num>
<num> millimetres <num>
<num> in × <num>
<num> in to <num>
<num> by <num>
<num> millimetres <num>
<num> in × <num>
<num> in and are variable in colour
many are pale blue speckled with fine brown dots and resemble those of the common blackbird
others are bright blue with or without larger red @-@ brown splotches
incubation starts before all the eggs are laid and lasts for thirteen to fourteen days
the female does all or most of the incubation
the chicks are altricial and both parents bring food to them
they are usually ready to leave the nest after fourteen to sixteen days and there may be two broods in the season especially in the southern parts of the breeding range
<num> million square miles and a large population including an estimated forty two to seventy two million individuals in europe
there are thought to be up to twenty thousand individuals in russia and the global population is estimated to be between forty four and ninety six million individuals
the population size appears to be stable and the bird is not believed to approach the thresholds for the population decline criteria of the iucn red list of threatened species i
e
declining more than <num> in ten years or three generations and is therefore evaluated as being of least concern
in the united kingdom at the extreme edge of the fieldfare 's breeding range only a handful of pairs breed
it is therefore classified by the rspb as a red list species as of january <year>
development of the type <num> pistol began in <year> and after several redesigns the final prototype was tested and officially adopted by the japanese army in late <year> japanese calendar <num>
the type <num> pistol entered production in <year>
approximately <num> @,@ <num> pistols were manufactured before production ended in <year>
the type <num> pistol was designed for and popular among japanese tank and aircraft crews who preferred a smaller lightweight design
japanese weapons experts have subsequently criticized some design elements of the type <num> in particular the pistol could be fired unintentionally before the breech was fully locked if the sear bar on the side of the receiver was jarred loose and the pistol was improperly handled
additionally the process to disassemble the pistol is overly complex and awkward
the build quality of the type <num> pistol declined over its production run last ditch pistols made in <year> were crudely manufactured
design for the type <num> nambu pistol commenced in <year> with the goal of reducing the bulk and price of previous nambu designs
the imperial japanese army felt a smaller pistol of domestic design that could accommodate the standard <num> × <num> nambu cartridge was needed to substitute the larger heavier and only official military pistol the type <num> nambu
the demand for officer 's handguns had increased as a result of japan 's invasion of manchuria during the second sino @-@ japanese war
a new design was also wanted by the japanese army to include a magazine safety to prevent unintentional discharges during cleaning that were common among japanese personnel
naming of the type <num> pistol reflects the change in japanese nomenclature with the <num> reckoning back to the mythical foundation of japan in <num> bc therefore year <num> instead of the traditional emperor reign period used to name the type <num> revolver or type <num> nambu pistol
the final prototype for the type <num> was officially adopted by the japanese army in late <year> after several redesigns
production began under the supervision of the nagoya army arsenal at the nambu rifle manufacturing company and later its successor chuo kogyo company ltd
an estimated <num> @,@ <num> pistols were produced for the military but the exact quantity is unknown because of the production of unserialized pistols and undated pistols
during world war ii the pistol became a preferred weapon for tank crews and paratroopers who required a smaller more convenient pistol
the type <num> was never officially adopted by the imperial japanese navy but was available to officers through the japanese officer 's union
unlike previously designed nambu pistols the type <num> operates with a concealed hammer and with a firing pin rather than a hammer
according to authors harry l
derby and james d
brown the firing pin is inherently weak and is prone to breakage because of a recess cut provided for the crossbolt and is prone to breaking at this point
the sturdier hammer firing mechanism was developed and included in the type <num> to replace the poor striker on the type <num> nambu
the locking system is a rising @-@ block type which floats independently between the lugs underneath the chamber end of the barrel
the single coil mainspring is positioned around the barrel around the barrel instead of to the rear of the barrel as found on other nambu pistols
the grip is smaller than other japanese pistols and is finished with smooth wood but according to author jeff kinard are more comfortable for use by men with smaller hands
the magazine holds a maximum of six rounds because of the smaller grip and it is considered difficult to reload the weapon with pressure from the bolt holding it inside the pistol
the magazine catch protrudes far enough to occasionally disengage when the pistol is placed on its left side on a hard surface
the magazine could also disengage if squeezed into or jarred in a holster
the manual safety lever is located on the left rear of the frame and has the kanji for fire and safe stamped onto the frame
the front blade sight on the muzzle of the type <num> pistol and the rear fixed v were occasionally inaccurately positioned making them useless when the weapon is being aimed
the rear sight was reduced from a u @-@ shape to a simple notch in <year> with the front blade being left unchanged but less attention to detail being applied as world war ii progressed
this drastic change in quality from late march <year> onwards with all quality standards appearing to disappear towards the end of june <year>
the smooth wooden finished grip was replaced by a bakelite checkered pattern
many pistols were not serialized and no pistols have been reported that bear july <year> manufacture date
only four unserialized and undated pistols are known to exist and include mismatch parts with no inspection marks lanyard loops and extractors
a small number of pistols made during the final production stages include earlier production dates and appear to have been salvaged from previously discarded pistols that had minor or cosmetic defects
after clearing the type <num> the operator must draw the slide against the magazine follower to hold the bolt to the rear of the pistol
this will allow the crossbolt to be released after the firing pin is depressed
removal of the crossbolt without depressing the firing pin will damage both the firing pin and the crossbolt
removing the crossbolt is further complicated as the disassemblers hands are both holding the pistol and depressing the firing pin
holsters faced the same degradation in quality as the type <num> pistol
as supplies of leather were exhausted in japan holsters manufactured in <year> became fabricated from olive drab fabric
the type <num> pistol holster is distinguishable from other japanese holsters having a pointed closure flap and a vertically positioned magazine pouch
the pouch tow has a narrow extension to accommodate a cleaning rod
the majority of holsters were made in civilian owned tanneries with some ink stamped with arsenal and inspection marks
a belt loop and two shoulder strap d rings are provided on the rear of the holster and are made from brass galvanized steel or nickel plating
the sear bar on the type <num> nambu converts the forward pull of the trigger into a lateral movement that frees the hammer
because the sear bar is on the outside of the pistol it could be jarred loose during engagement if the pistol was cocked and handled carelessly
the forward end of the sear bar would need to be depressed approximately <num> to cause the weapon to fire
the ability to fire the type <num> without pulling the trigger gave rise to war stories of japanese soldiers surrendering only to fire the pistol earning the pistol monikers such as the suicide special and the surrender pistol
these stories are widely discredited because of the difficulty to fire the weapon by squeezing the sear bar
if the safety is engaged on the type <num> it is impossible for the weapon to discharge unintentionally

however it was partially rebuilt with old materials by the crusaders who conquered the area in <num>
the crusaders built a large courtyard building in jifna

he ruled during the late classic period from <num> – <num> ad
ha k 'in xook was a son of itzam k 'an ahk ii and he ascended the throne upon the death of his brother yo 'nal ahk iii
ha k 'in xook 's reign seems to have ended either with his death or his abdication in favor of his brother k 'inich yat ahk ii archaeologists and mayanists have not come to a clear consensus on this
ha k 'in xook left behind several monuments including stelae at piedras negras and a stone fragment from el porvenir
in addition a stone seat known as throne <num> which was erected by k 'inich yat ahk ii records either the death or abdication of ha k 'in xook
according to both simon martin and nikolai grube as well as johnson ha k 'in xook 's name translates to water sun shark
of note his name does not feature a turtle glyph a feature found in all the previous rulers of piedras negras as well as his successor
he ascended the throne on february <num> <num> ad <num>
<num>
<num>
<num>
<num> <num> k 'an <num> pop in the long count following the death of his brother yo 'nal ahk iii
ha k 'in xook 's kingship of piedras negras had originally been overlooked by tatiana proskouriakoff who instead assigned the title ruler <num> to a misidentified sajal — or maya leader — of la mar
not much is known about the rule of ha k 'in xook his reign along with that of yo 'nal ahk iii has been referred to as shadowy by flora clancy and james l
fitzsimmons argues that ha k 'in xook seems to have been a weaker ruler when compared to the reign of itzam k 'an ahk ii because ha k 'in xook erected few monuments and he did not reinforce his power on a larger scale choosing only to do so at local polities
the only notable recorded event that has been preserved during the life of ha k 'in xook is of an incident that took place at el cayo most likely related to the burial of a contemporary sajal
according to zachary nathan nelson the reign of ha k 'in xook seems to have been relatively free from war as none of his extant stelae show representation of captives and known records do not indicate any sort of bellicose action in the region during his reign
<num>
<num>
<num>

the reason why his reign came to an end has been a topic of debate
some believe that his reign ended with his abdication
throne <num> when translated notes that he abandoned transferred rulership which american mayanist stephen d
houston interprets to mean that he abdicated in favor of his brother k 'inich yat ahk ii
mayanist david stuart also noted that the wording on the throne implies a more active event on the ruler 's part but that lose might be more neutral as far as an interpretation goes
however the exact phrase on the monument is yaktaaj ajawlel which is the same wording that was used when the burden of leadership passed from k 'ak tiliw chan yopaat the k 'ul ahaw of quiriguá to his successor sky xul during his burial ten days after his demise in <num> ad
as such this may suggest that rather than abdicating ha k 'in xook died in <num> ad and his successor k 'inich yat ahk ii took up rule later
the deciphered glyphs on throne <num> note that k 'inich yat ahk ii later remembered ha k 'in xook at the paw stone place in some way and that the new king may have possibly wept at the memory of ha k 'in xook according to anthropologist oswaldo chinchilla mazariegos
regardless k 'inich yat ahk ii took up the throne on may <num> <num> ad <num>
<num>
<num>
<num>
<num> <num> k 'an <num> yaxk 'in almost a year following the end of ha k 'in xook 's reign
despite this lengthy gap there appears to be no evidence of anyone ruling piedras negras between the two kings
stela <num> would appear to be the earliest showing the oldest dedicatory date assigned to ha 'k'in xook and it captures the essence of the period @-@ ending celebration
this <num>
<num> @-@ metre <num>
<num> ft tall stela retains stylistic elements of other niche stelae but also shows a different form
it depicts the king scattering incense similar to iconography found on piedras negras stelae <num> and <num>
clancy has argued that the stela contains iconography pertaining to three motifs divination the quest and accession
divination is shown via the act of ha k 'in xook scattering the incense
this motif had been introduced earlier in the iconography of piedras negras by k 'inich yo 'nal ahk ii
the stela also features ha k 'in xook wearing a unique headdress it is depicted as being composed of three knots and forehead scrolls a projecting water lily jaguar and a flexible rectangular emblem made from a jaguar pelt and a thick net
it has been postulated that this headdress was inspired by the headdress worn by an enthroned figure from the underworld featured on stela <num>
clancy argues that this headdress is a representation of the royal theme of quest due to its iconographic similarity to other stelae at piedras negras
in addition stela <num> remains ha k 'in xook 's only extant image
not much remains of stela <num> and what is left is badly worn
however archaeologist sylvanus morley claimed that it expressed a calendar round date of <num> ahaw <num> k 'ayab corresponding to a long count date of <num>
<num>
<num>
<num>
<num> or dec
<num> <num> which martin and grube note is within ha k 'in xook 's reign
stela <num> is the king 's accession monument
originally carved on all four faces this stela is in poor condition because it tipped over and shattered
the largest portions remaining include the base and remnants of a basal panel of glyphs that feature the feet of two individuals
similar to stela <num> martin and grube argue that stela <num> dates to the rulership of ha k 'in xook because the calendar round date on the monument is contemporary with the date found on stela <num>
this stele details a puluuy utz 'itil ceremony for ha k 'in xook 's dead father itzam k 'an ahk ii and when translated reads ruler <num> ha k 'in xook child of ruler <num> itzam k 'an ahk ii … acceded to the rulership seemingly proving that ha k 'in xook was indeed the offspring of itzam k 'an ahk ii
all three of the stelae were discovered by teoberto maler in <year> near one of the site 's main temple the o @-@ <num> pyramid
stela <num> was possibly erected on a terrace reached by the pyramid 's main stairway and stela <num> lies in a row on the plaza in front of the aforementioned stairway
stela <num> on the other hand was erected at the very base of the pyramid
this pyramid was most likely the burial place for itzam k 'an ahk ii and — seeing as how ha k 'in xook yo 'nal ahk iii and k 'inich yat ahk ii all revered the site as a dynastic shrine — it is further evidence to back the argument that ha k 'in xook was the son of itzam k 'an ahk ii
however it should be noted that the throne was not constructed by the king himself but rather by his successor k 'inich yat ahk ii
the throne was later deliberately broken apart by piedras negras 's enemies but has since been reconstructed
in addition to on @-@ site remains and relics a fragment of stone found at el porvenir and aptly called the el porvenir fragment was also discovered that bore the name of ha k 'in xook

hopes of any future comeback were ended by the emergence of powerful centre @-@ forward nat lofthouse who made his england debut in november <year>
he boasted a strong physique and good ball control skills as well as a great passing range and a powerful shot
he was naturally right @-@ footed though worked to improve his left foot to a good enough standard to be considered a two @-@ footed player
his greatest strength though was his ability to head the ball as he possessed muscular legs to give himself a strong jump and long hang @-@ time and was also able to time his jumps to perfection

the idea for the episode was suggested by rené echevarria and ronald d
moore suggested the link to the trouble with tribbles
the pair were credited for their work on the teleplay with the story credit going to ira steven behr hans beimler and robert hewitt wolfe
set in the <num> century the series follows the adventures on deep space nine a space station located near a stable wormhole between the alpha and gamma quadrants of the milky way galaxy
in this episode captain benjamin sisko avery brooks and the crew travel back in time to prevent the assassination of captain james t
kirk william shatner of the uss enterprise by a klingon using a booby @-@ trapped tribble
moore had originally suggested re @-@ visiting the planet seen in the original series episode a piece of the action but was convinced by echevarria that the digitally inserted shots previously seen in forrest gump <year> could be done on a small budget
after a test shot was completed the rest of the production team were also convinced that it could be achieved
the budget was set at <num> million with extensive work completed on matching the film techniques used during the original series
some original costumes were found for the klingons while others were made from patterns created by robert blackman
greg jein created new models of the enterprise as well as deep space station k7 and the klingon cruiser while <num> @,@ <num> tribbles were purchased from a company owned by majel barrett
charlie brill returned to star trek to appear once more as arne darvin and deidre l

walter koenig who portrayed ensign pavel chekov in the original series showed the deep space nine cast how to work the consoles on the enterprise sets

jansen
the captain explains that he was on the uss defiant returning from cardassian space with the bajoran orb of time
they had picked up a hitchhiker on the way a human called barry waddle
suddenly the ship found itself some <num> light years away from its previous location and a hundred years in the past near deep space station k7 and found the uss enterprise in orbit
they discover that the hitch @-@ hiker was arne darvin charlie brill a klingon agent who had previously been caught by captain james t
kirk william shatner on k7 whilst trying to poison a shipment of grain
fearing that darvin may be attempting to assassinate kirk the crew dress in period uniforms and investigate the enterprise
they attempt to interact with history as little as possible whilst investigating darvin
the crew does not initially recognize the klingons of the time period and when worf michael dorn is asked about the difference in appearance he replies that the matter is not discussed with outsiders this is further expanded on in the star trek enterprise episodes affliction and divergence
doctor julian bashir alexander siddig and chief miles o 'brien colm meaney get involved in a bar brawl between the enterprise crew and a number of klingons on shore leave
captain kirk disciplines them on the enterprise alongside chief engineer montgomery scott james doohan and ensign pavel chekov walter koenig
bashir and o 'brien notice that the ship is covered with tribbles
lieutenant commander worf michael dorn and odo rené auberjonois trail darvin as he returns to the defiant
there darvin admits that he planted a bomb in a tribble to kill kirk
sisko and lieutenant jadzia dax terry farrell board the enterprise but can find no trace of a bomb
they travel to k7 and scans indicate that the bomb is in the grain storage compartments
they enter the compartments and discover that the poisoned grain has all been eaten by tribbles who are now all dead
suddenly captain kirk opens the compartment and is covered in falling tribbles
dax and sisko find the bomb before it can kill kirk and the defiant transports it into space where it explodes
the crew of the defiant use the bajoran orb to travel back to the present time and sisko finishes explaining the situation to the temporal agents
the episode ends with quark armin shimerman in his bar on deep space nine 's promenade with numerous tribbles around him
the film star trek first contact was entering production a television special was planned to celebrate the franchise and george takei had been cast to appear in the star trek voyager episode flashback
producer ira steven behr later recalled that he thought that deep space nine might end up being missed out as he considered it to be the middle child of the franchise
however rick berman contacted behr and asked him if he would be interested in doing something to celebrate the anniversary
behr agreed to discuss it with the staff writers
initially there was concern that if the proposed episode aired during the actual anniversary week around september <num> that it would have to serve as the season opener pre @-@ empting the already planned opener
the writers discussed potential ideas
ronald d
moore had previously brought back montgomery scott for the star trek the next generation episode relics and since takei was appearing in voyager they felt that having a member of the main cast from the original series return would be repetitive
some consideration was given by moore to sending the ds9 crew to the gangster @-@ type planet visited by kirk in the episode a piece of the action
it was rené echevarria who suggested a time @-@ travel episode which was seen as an expensive proposition
echevarria however pressed for the idea
moore suggested inserting the ds9 crew into the trouble with tribbles suggesting it could resolve the question of why a constant stream of tribbles kept hitting kirk in the head
when the discussion came to inserting the ds9 crew into the bar @-@ brawl scene berman liked the idea but was unsure if it could actually be done
visual effects supervisor gary hutzel created test footage and screened it for behr and moore who thought that it was simply footage from the original episode
once hutzel revealed that an additional security officer had been seamlessly added to the sequence the episode was green @-@ lit
during the scripting process the trouble with tribbles was regularly consulted so the writers could decide where to insert characters
the temporal agents dulmer and lucsly were so named as they were anagrams of mulder and scully from the x @-@ files
original tribbles creator david gerrold was contacted by the new york times who wanted to interview him about the anniversary and the rumored tribbles episode
when he questioned berman about the episode berman initially denied it
gerrold responded that he didn 't want to embarrass anyone but would like to be able to endorse the project
berman asked what the endorsement would cost to which gerrold requested public acknowledgement of his work and to be cast as an extra in the episode
berman agreed
gerrold compared inserting new footage into an existing episode to back to the future part ii <year> and later said that he would have gone in a different direction had he written the story
nonetheless he felt the final product ended up being better than anything he would have created
west had previously been the cinematographer on staff for both deep space nine and the next generation as well as directing several episodes of the franchise
he had nine days of preparation time before shooting began
he sought to match the same production values as the original series but found that lighting style and color saturation to film had changed in the intervening years
visual effects supervisor dan curry directed some of the second @-@ unit sequences and together with west and cinematographer kris krossgrove worked to rectify these issues
this was achieved by switching to a finer grain of film by utilizing different lenses as well as by shooting from specific angles
with gerrold on set as an extra west used him as an unofficial advisor on matching the scenes from the trouble with tribbles
the actual digital insertion of actors was conducted in the same manner as seen in the film forrest gump <year>
the original footage was remastered and was seen as such an improvement that it inspired the subsequent clean @-@ up and re @-@ release of all of original series episodes
this remaster was conducted by hutzel and was the first transfer since <year> when a version was created for vhs and laser disc release
hutzel identified <num> scenes from the trouble with tribbles which were matched in trials and tribble @-@ ations
the scene matching between the new footage and the old took nine weeks to complete with a budget of <num> million
it involved both two @-@ dimensional and three @-@ dimensional tracking shots as well as insertion of matte shots and the use of both blue and green screens for the actors
not all shots seen in the episode were actually taken from the trouble with tribbles
the scene where sisko meets kirk on the bridge towards the end of the episode was instead taken from the episode mirror mirror
due in part to the special effects the costuming the set re @-@ constructions and the residual payments to the original series cast behr later described trials and tribble @-@ ations as probably the most expensive hour of episodic tv ever produced
the only member of the original series cast who was spoken to directly by the producers was leonard nimoy who was enthusiastic about the idea and was surprised that it had taken them so long to come up with the idea
the remaining cast members were each contacted through paramount 's legal department
dennis mccarthy wanted to re @-@ work the jerry fielding score previously used on the trouble with tribbles
he said that he intended to use the production equipment and orchestra available to bring the score up to the same scale previously seen on deep space nine
however the producers wanted a new score and so mccarthy explained that he composed it in a fielding @-@ inspired mindset
the only piece that was directly re @-@ recorded by mccarthy was the alexander courage theme from star trek which involved a <num> piece orchestra
mcilvain spent a fair amount of time getting the window angles correct on the sets
mike okuda re @-@ created the graphics seen on the enterprise sets using a computer whilst others were re @-@ drawn by artist doug drexler
some sets were not re @-@ created in full such as the bridge which required parts of it to be later added digitally
the captain 's chair from the bridge re @-@ creation was later one of the star trek items to be auctioned by christie 's
set designer laura richarz watched the trouble with tribbles carefully looking for small details to replicate on the new sets such as the legs of benches in the bar on k7
however she said her biggest challenge was tracking down the chairs seen on the space station
she contacted john m
dwyer who had worked on the original episode
he explained to her that the company which created the original chairs had gone out of business
after searching shops selling retro furniture the production team found a single chair that matched those seen in the original episode
it was purchased and a mold was made to create more chairs
the actors were impressed when they saw the resulting sets with terry farrell exclaiming wow we 're on the enterprise greg jein had already been working on a new model of the uss excelsior for the flashback episode of voyager when he saw the test footage for trials and tribble @-@ ations
he promised to make a new model of the enterprise too but warned that he didn 't know when he would have time to do it
he actually started work on it immediately and together with his colleagues he not only built a <num>
<num> feet <num>
<num> m long model of the enterprise but created a new model of deep space station k7 and the klingon cruiser as well
the enterprise model was the first to be built of the original star trek starship in more than <num> years
other props were also recreated with around <num> @,@ <num> tribbles created for the various scenes
they were purchased from lincoln enterprises a company set up by majel barrett widow of star trek creator gene roddenberry
the rest of the era @-@ specific props were newly created and were made by steve horsch
costume designer robert blackman was concerned over the re @-@ creation of the klingon uniforms seen in the original series as he thought that the metallic material used would be nearly impossible to create accurately
he was subsequently relieved to have found four original costumes and an additional shirt in the costume archives calling them a godsend
his team created patterns from other costumes to remake them
make @-@ up supervisor michael westmore had previously worked on a television series during the <num> and recalled what type of make @-@ up was available at the time
he had the team restrict themselves to techniques of that era to ensure that the ds9 crew blended properly into the scenes
the hairstyles of the crew were also meant to be reminiscent of the original series with alexander siddig sporting a style previously seen on james doohan
rené auberjonois said that his new hairstyle reminded him of jerry lee lewis
behr said of the cast and crew in the episode that they all were having fun
just sitting on those sets being on that bridge it was a hoot a real hoot
deidre l
imershein was brought in at the last minute to play lt
watley as she was a friend of one of the production crew and had previously appeared as a risan pleasure girl in the next generation episode captain 's holiday
she was brought in because none of the actresses the producers had seen during the casting process could say the role 's one line deck <num> convincingly enough
her involvement led to the role 's being expanded into a second scene where she was revealed to be bashir 's great @-@ grandmother
charlie brill returned to film new scenes as klingon agent arne darvin while original series writer gerrold was allowed to appear as an extra in two scenes as a crewman from the enterprise
in one of those scenes he was holding an original tribble from the trouble with tribbles
walter koenig was on hand as well during the filming of the episode to teach the ds9 actors how the consoles were operated on the enterprise
koenig later commented that he was paid eight times as much for this and the residual payment as he had been for the original episode
a string of other visitors came to the set during filming including majel barrett and former the next generation producer and tos co @-@ producer bob justman
paramount also promoted the episode by arranging the placement of around <num> @,@ <num> tribbles in subways and buses across the united states
it received nielsen ratings of <num>
<num> placing it in sixth place in the timeslot
this meant that it had been watched by <num>
<num> of all households
it was the most watched episode of the fifth season during its initial broadcast
the last time the series had received similar ratings was nearly a year earlier with season four 's little green men
two reviewers watched the episode for tor
com
torie atkinson described trials and tribble @-@ ations as a perfect episode and one of the best star trek episodes ever made in any series
she praised the humour and the references and found dax in her role as a stand @-@ in for fans of the original series
she gave the episode a score of six out of six
eugene myers wasn 't disappointed following the hype about the episode saying that it was steeped in nostalgia
he thought that the bomb @-@ in @-@ a @-@ tribble plot was ingenious and allowed the episode to step outside of merely being good due to the success of the trouble with tribbles
his favourite scene was the constant stream of tribbles hitting kirk in the head because sisko and dax were throwing them out of the grain compartment while looking for the bomb
he also gave the episode a score of six out of six
zack handlen in his review for the a
v
club called the episode a delight and a lark
he thought that having brill film new scenes showed some continuity between the old and the new and thought that the special effects worked well enough
he summed it up by saying it 's not tightly plotted and once the initial rush of nostalgia fades there isn 't a lot of depth or suspense to replace it
but there are laughs more than enough to justify the experiment and the nostalgia never fades away entirely
in the book deep space and sacred time star trek in the american mythos jon wagner and jan lundeen compared the temporal agents seen in trials and tribble @-@ ations to the police detectives seen in the television series dragnet
gem wheeler in her list of the best episodes of deep space nine for website den of geek listed trials and tribble @-@ ations as the sixth best
in a list of the top <num> episodes of the star trek franchise trials and tribble @-@ ations was placed in <num> place by charlie jane anders at io9

however it was not successful in any of those categories
it was also nominated for the hugo award for best dramatic presentation as the trouble with tribbles had been in <year>
in <year> a talking tribble gift set was released which contained both the trouble with tribbles and trials and tribble @-@ ations on vhs

commissioned by the conservative belgian newspaper le vingtième siècle for its children 's supplement le petit vingtième it was serialised weekly from may <year> to june <year> before being published in a collected volume by éditions de petit vingtième in <year>
the story tells of young belgian reporter tintin and his dog snowy who are sent to the belgian congo to report on events in the country
amid various encounters with the native congolese people and wild animals tintin unearths a criminal diamond smuggling operation run by the american gangster al capone
following on from tintin in the land of the soviets and bolstered by publicity stunts tintin in the congo was a commercial success within belgium and was also serialised in france
hergé continued the adventures of tintin with tintin in america in <year> and the series subsequently became a defining part of the franco @-@ belgian comics tradition
in <year> hergé re @-@ drew and coloured tintin in the congo in his distinctive ligne @-@ claire style for republication by casterman with further alterations made at the request of his scandinavian publisher for a <year> edition
in the late <num> century tintin in the congo came under criticism for both its perceived racist colonial attitude toward the congolese and for its glorification of big @-@ game hunting accordingly attempts were made in belgium sweden the united kingdom and the united states to either ban the work or restrict its availability to children
critical reception of the work has been largely negative with commentators on the adventures of tintin describing it as one of hergé 's weakest works
tintin hires a native boy coco to assist him in his travels and shortly after tintin rescues snowy from a crocodile
a criminal stowaway attempts to kill tintin but monkeys throw coconuts at the stowaway that knock him unconscious
a monkey kidnaps snowy but tintin saves him
the next morning tintin snowy and coco crash their car into a train which the reporter fixes and tows to the village of the babaorum tribe
he meets the king who accompanies him on a hunt the next day
a lion knocks tintin unconscious but snowy rescues him by biting off its tail
tintin gains the admiration of the natives making the babaorum witch @-@ doctor muganga jealous
when he cures a man using quinine he is hailed as a boula matari breaker of rocks
with the help of the criminal stowaway muganga accuses tintin of destroying the tribe 's sacred idol
the enraged villagers imprison tintin but then turn against muganga when coco shows them footage tintin had made of the witch @-@ doctor and the stowaway conspiring to destroy the idol
tintin becomes a hero in the village and a local woman bows down to him saying white man very great has good spirits
white mister is big juju man angered muganga starts a war between the babaorum and their neighbours the m 'hatuvu whose king leads an attack on the babaorum village
tintin outwits them and the m 'hatuvu cease hostilities and come to idolise tintin
muganga and the stowaway plot to kill tintin and make it look like a leopard attack but tintin survives and saves muganga from a boa constrictor muganga pleads mercy and ends his hostilities
the stowaway attempts to capture tintin again and eventually succeeds disguised as a catholic missionary
they fight across a waterfall and the stowaway is eaten by crocodiles
after reading a letter from the stowaway 's pocket tintin finds that someone called a
c
has ordered his elimination
tintin captures a criminal who tried to rendezvous with the stowaway and learns that a
c
is the american gangster al capone who is trying to gain control of african diamond production
tintin and the colonial police arrest the rest of the diamond smuggling gang and tintin and snowy return to belgium
run by the abbé norbert wallez the paper described itself as a catholic newspaper for doctrine and information and disseminated a far @-@ right fascist viewpoint
according to harry thompson such political ideas were common in belgium at the time and hergé 's milieu was permeated with conservative ideas revolving around patriotism catholicism strict morality discipline and naivety
in <year> hergé began the adventures of tintin comic strip for le petit vingtième a series about the exploits of a fictional belgian reporter named tintin
following the success of tintin in the land of the soviets serialised weekly in le petit vingtième from january <year> to may <year> hergé wanted to send tintin to the united states
wallez insisted he write a story set in the belgian congo then a belgian colony and today the democratic republic of the congo
belgian children learned about the congo in school and wallez hoped to encourage colonialist and missionary zeal in his readership
he believed that the belgian colonial administration needed promotion at a time when memories were still fairly fresh of the <year> visit to the colony by the belgian king albert and queen elisabeth
he also hoped that some of his readers would be inspired to work in the congo
hergé characterised wallez 's instructions in a sarcastic manner saying wallez referred to the congo as our beautiful colony which has great need of us tarantara tarantaraboom
he already had some experience in illustrating congolese scenes three years previously hergé had provided two illustrations for the newspaper that appeared in an article celebrating the fiftieth anniversary of henry morton stanley 's expedition to the congo
in one of these hergé depicted a native congolese bowing before a european a scene that he repeated in tintin in the congo
as in land of the soviets where hergé had based his information about the soviet union almost entirely on a single source in tintin in the congo he used limited source material to learn about the country and its people
he based the story largely on literature written by missionaries with the only added element being that of the diamond smugglers possibly adopted from the jungle jim @-@ type serials
hergé visited the colonial museum of tervuren examining their ethnographic collections of congolese artefacts including costumes of the leopard men
he adopted hunting scenes from andré maurois 's novel the silence of colonel bramble while his animal drawings were inspired by benjamin rabier 's prints
he also listened to tales of the colony from some of his colleagues who had been there but disliked their stories later claiming i didn 't like the colonists who came back bragging about their exploits
but i couldn 't prevent myself from seeing the blacks as big children either
drawn in black and white it followed the same formula employed in land of the soviets remaining essentially plotless according to michael farr and consisting of largely unrelated events that hergé improvised each week
hergé later commented on the process of writing these early adventures stating the petit vingtième came out on wednesday evening and i often didn 't have a clue on wednesday morning how i was going to get tintin out of the predicament i had put him in the previous week
the strip 's visual style was similar to that of land of the soviets
in the first instalment of tintin in the congo hergé featured quick and flupke two young boys from brussels whom he had recently introduced in another le petit vingtième comic strip in the crowd of people saying goodbye to tintin
like land of the soviets tintin in the congo was popular in belgium
on the afternoon of <num> july <year> wallez repeated the publicity stunt he had used when soviets ended by having a young actor henry de doncker dress up as tintin in colonial gear and appear in brussels and then liège accompanied by <num> african bearers and an assortment of exotic animals hired from a zoo
co @-@ organised with the bon marché department store the event attracted <num> @,@ <num> spectators in brussels
in <year> brussels @-@ based éditions de petit vingtième collected the story together into a single volume and casterman published a second edition in <year>
by <year> the book had been reprinted seven times and had outsold each of the other seven books in the series
the series success led wallez to renegotiate hergé 's contract giving him a higher salary and the right to work from home
hergé first made some changes in this direction in <year> when the story was serialised in the flemish @-@ language het laatste nieuws
at casterman 's prompting tintin in the congo was subsequently fully re @-@ drawn and the new version was published in <year>
as a part of this modification hergé cut the page length from <num> plates to the standard <num> pages as suggested by the publisher casterman
he also made several changes to the story cutting many of the references to belgium and colonial rule
for example in the scene where tintin teaches congolese school children about geography he states in the <year> – <num> version my dear friends today i 'm going to talk to you about your country belgium whereas in the <year> version he instead gives them a mathematics lesson
hergé also changed the character of jimmy macduff the owner of the leopard that attacks tintin from a black manager of the great american circus into a white supplier of the biggest zoos in europe
in the <year> colour version hergé added a cameo appearance from thomson and thompson the two detectives that he had introduced in the fourth tintin story cigars of the pharaoh <year> – <num> which was chronologically set after the congolese adventure
adding them to the first page hergé featured them in the backdrop watching a crowd surrounding tintin as he boards a train and commenting that it seems to be a young reporter going to africa
in the same frame hergé inserted depictions of himself and his friend edgar p
jacobs the book 's colourist into the crowd seeing tintin off
they asked hergé to replace this page with a less violent scene which they believed would be more suitable for children
hergé agreed as he regretted the scenes of big @-@ game hunting in the work soon after producing it
the altered page involved the rhinoceros running away unharmed after accidentally knocking down and triggering tintin 's gun
although publishers worldwide had made it available for many years english publishers refused to publish tintin in the congo because of its racist content
in the late <num> nick rodwell then agent of studios hergé in the united kingdom told reporters of his intention to finally publish it in english and stated his belief that publishing the original <year> black and white edition would cause less controversy than releasing the <year> colour version
after more delay in <year> — sixty years after its original <year> publication — it was the last of the adventures of tintin to see publication in english
the <year> colour version appeared in english in <year> published by egmont
he thought that the story began in the most inoffensive way and that throughout the story tintin was portrayed as a boy scout something he argued reflected hergé 's moral debt to wallez
biographer benoît peeters opined that tintin in the congo was nothing spectacular with some incredibly cumbersome monologues but he thought the illustrations a bit more polished than those in land of the soviets
believing the plot to be extremely simple he thought that tintin 's character was like a child manipulating a world populated by toy animals and lead figurines
michael farr felt that unlike the previous tintin adventure some sense of a plot emerges at the end of the story with the introduction of the american diamond @-@ smuggling racket
philippe goddin thought the work to be more exciting than land of the soviets and argued that hergé 's depiction of the native congolese was not mocking but a parody of past european militaries
by contrast harry thompson believed that congo is almost a regression from soviets in his opinion having no plot or characterisation he described it as probably the most childish of all the tintin books
simon kuper of the financial times criticised both land of the soviets and tintin in the congo as the worst of the adventures opining that they were poorly drawn and largely plot @-@ free
farr saw the <year> colour version as poorer than the black and white original he said it had lost its vibrancy and atmosphere and that the new depiction of the congolese landscape was unconvincing and more like a european zoo than the parched dusty expanses of reality
peeters took a more positive attitude towards the <year> version commenting that it contained aesthetic improvements and clarity of composition because of hergé 's personal development in draughtsmanship as well as an enhancement in the dialogue which had become more lively and fluid
in his psychoanalytical study of the series jean @-@ marie apostolidès highlighted that in the congolese adventure tintin represented progress and the belgian state was a model for the natives to imitate
in doing so he argued they could become more european and thus civilised from the perspective of belgian society but that instead they ended up appearing as parodies
opining that tintin was imposing his own view of africa onto the congolese apostolidès remarked that tintin appeared as a god @-@ figure with evangelical overtones in the final scene
literary critic tom mccarthy concurred that tintin represented the belgian state but also suggested that he acted as a christian missionary even being a kind of god akin to the character of kurtz in joseph conrad 's heart of darkness <year>
mccarthy compared the scene where tintin exposes muganga as a fraud to that in which the character of prospero exposes the magician in william shakespeare 's the tempest
according to tom mccarthy hergé depicted the congolese as good at heart but backwards and lazy in need of european mastery
there had been no such controversy when originally published because it was only following the wind of change and decolonisation which occurred during the <num> and <num> that western attitudes towards indigenous africans shifted
harry thompson argued that one must view tintin in the congo in the context of european society in the <num> and <num> and that hergé had not written the book to be deliberately racist
he argued that it reflected the average belgian view of congolese people at the time one that was more patronising than malevolent
jean @-@ marie apostolidès supported this idea as did biographer benoît peeters who asserted hergé was no more racist than the next man
after meeting hergé in the <num> farr commented you couldn 't have met someone who was more open and less racist
contrastingly biographer pierre assouline stated that in <num> belgium hergé would have had access to literature by the likes of andré gide and albert londres that was critical of the colonial regime
assouline claimed that hergé instead chose not to read such reports because they conflicted with the views of his conservative milieu
laurence grove — president of the international bande dessinée society and an academic at the university of glasgow — concurred remarking that hergé adhered to prevailing societal trends in his work and that w hen it was fashionable to be a colonial racist that 's what he was
comic book historian mark mckinney noted that other franco @-@ belgian comic artists of the same period had chosen to depict the native africans in a more favourable light citing the examples of jijé 's <year> work blondin et cirage blondy and shoe @-@ black in which the protagonists are adopted brothers one white the other black and tif et tondu which was serialised in spirou from <year> to <year> and in which the congolese aid the belgians against their american antagonists
farr and mccarthy stated that tintin in the congo was the most popular tintin adventure in francophone africa
according to thompson the book remained hugely popular in the congo even after the country achieved independence in <year>
nevertheless government figures in the democratic republic of the congo drc have criticised the book
in <year> after the belgian minister of foreign affairs karel de gucht described president joseph kabila 's provisional drc government as incompetent congolese information minister henri mova sakanyi accused him of racism and nostalgia for colonialism remarking that it was like tintin in the congo all over again
de gucht refused to retract his statement
in july <year> british human rights lawyer david enright complained to the united kingdom 's commission for racial equality cre that he came across the book in the children 's section of borders bookshop while shopping with his wife and two sons
the cre called on bookshops to remove the comic stating that it contained hideous racial prejudice by depicting congolese who look like monkeys and talk like imbeciles
responding that it was committed to letting its customers make the choice borders moved the book to an area reserved for adult graphic novels
uk bookseller waterstone 's followed suit
another british retailer whsmith said that the book was sold on its website but with a label that recommended it for readers aged <num> and over
the cre 's attempt to ban the book was criticised by conservative party politician ann widdecombe who remarked that the organisation had more important things to do than regulate the availability of historical children 's books
the media controversy increased interest in the book and borders reported that its sales of tintin in the congo had been boosted <num> @,@ <num> while it also rose to eighth on the amazon
com bestseller list
publisher egmont uk also responded to racism concerns by placing a protective band around the book with a warning about its content and writing an introduction describing its historical context
tintin in the congo also came under criticism in the united states in october <year> in response to a complaint by a patron the brooklyn public library in new york city placed the graphic novel in a locked back room only permitting access by appointment
tintin in the congo became part of a drawn @-@ out media debate in sweden after national newspaper dagens nyheter reported the removal of tinin in the congo from a children 's library in kulturhuset in stockholm in september <year>
the incident nicknamed tintin @-@ gate led to heated discussions in mainstream and social media concerning accusations of racism and censorship
in august <year> congolese student bienvenu mbutu mondondo filed a complaint in brussels claiming that the book was an insult to the congolese people and required banning
public prosecutors investigated and initiated a criminal case
the matter was eventually transferred to a civil court in april <year>
mondondo 's lawyers argued that tintin in the congo amounted to a justification of colonisation and of white supremacy and mondondo called it racist and xenophobic
alain berenboom lawyer for both moulinsart the company which controls hergé 's estate and casterman the book 's publisher argued that the cartoonist 's depiction of the congolese wasn 't racism but kind paternalism
he said that banning it would set a dangerous precedent for the availability of works by other historical authors such as charles dickens or jules verne which contain similar stereotypes of non @-@ white ethnicities
the court ruled in february <year> that the book would not be banned deciding that it was clear that neither the story nor the fact that it has been put on sale has a goal to
create an intimidating hostile degrading or humiliating environment and that it therefore did not break belgian law
belgium 's centre for equal opportunities warned against over @-@ reaction and hyper political correctness
shortly after swedish @-@ belgian jean @-@ dadaou monyas filed a similar complaint which was supported by afrosvenskarna an interest group for swedes of african descent
the complaint to the chancellor of justice was turned down as violations of hate speech restrictions in the swedish fundamental law on freedom of expression must be filed within one year of publication and the latest swedish edition of tintin in the congo appeared in <year>
the south african comics writer anton kannemeyer has parodied the perceived racist nature of the book to highlight what he sees as the continuing racist undertones of south african society
in his pappa in afrika <year> a satire of tintin in the congo he portrays tintin as an afrikaner with racist views of indigenous africans
such scenes reflect the popularity of big @-@ game hunting among whites and affluent visitors in sub @-@ saharan africa during the <num>
hergé later felt guilty about his portrayal of animals in tintin in the congo and became an opponent of blood sports when he wrote cigars of the pharaoh <year> he had tintin befriend a herd of elephants living in the indian jungle
philippe goddin stated that the scene in which tintin shoots a herd of antelope was enough to upset even the least ecological reader in the 21st century
when india book house first published the book in india in <year> that nation 's branch of the people for the ethical treatment of animals issued a public criticism and chief functionary anuradha sawhney stated that the book was replete with instances that send a message to young minds that it is acceptable to be cruel to animals
although he did not win the competition he received a contract to record with syco music a label owned by the britain 's got talent judge simon cowell
johnston 's debut album one voice was released in september of the same year and reached number four on the uk albums chart

his mother also described johnston 's busy regimen of practice four times a week and all day sundays saying that it took up all of their spare time
however she said that the cathedral staff became like a family to her son and that it was such a lovely safe close feeling for him
johnston who attended trinity school was subject to abuse and threats from bullies which drove him to contemplate quitting the choir but he was helped through the ordeal by his choirmaster and the dean and canons of the cathedral

johnston and other contestants then embarked on a national arena tour
during his initial audition johnston claimed that he was bullied and victimised from the age of six because of his singing
when asked how he dealt with the issue he stated i carry on singing
there were claims in the daily mail a uk @-@ based tabloid newspaper that the programme 's producers had deliberately overstated the extent of johnston 's bullying as a sob story suggesting that sympathy rather than his singing got him many of the votes
however in the times johnston 's success story was described as the stuff of fairytales as he was successful despite having been raised in poverty
johnston said he did not talk about being bullied because he was told to do so by producers but because i believed it would help people who were going through what i had gone through be stronger
johnston has subsequently visited schools and elsewhere to help other victims of bullying

s
state of illinois
illinois is stevens second based on a u
s
state — part of a planned series of fifty that began with the <year> album michigan that stevens has since acknowledged was a gag
stevens recorded and produced the album at multiple venues in new york city using low @-@ fidelity studio equipment and a variety of instruments between late <year> and early <year>
the artwork and lyrics explore the history culture art and geography of the state — stevens developed them after analyzing criminal literary and historical documents
following a july <num> <year> release date stevens promoted illinois with a world tour
critics praised the album for its well @-@ written lyrics and complex orchestrations in particular reviewers noted stevens progress as a songwriter since the release of michigan
illinois was named the best @-@ reviewed album of <year> by review aggregator metacritic and was included on several reviewers best of the decade lists — including those of paste npr and rolling stone
the album amounted to stevens greatest public success to date it was his first to place on the billboard <num> and it topped the billboard list of heatseekers albums
the varied instrumentation and experimental songwriting on the album invoked comparisons to work by steve reich neil young and the cure
besides numerous references to illinois history geography and attractions stevens continued a theme of his songwriting career by including multiple references to his christian faith
before creating the album stevens read literature by illinois authors saul bellow and carl sandburg and studied immigration records and history books for the state — he made the deliberate decision to avoid current events and focused on historical themes
he also took trips through several locations in illinois and asked friends and members of internet chat rooms for anecdotes about their experiences in the state
although he began work in <year> on oregon @-@ themed songs and briefly considered releasing a rhode island <num> stevens has since not released another album focused on a state saying in a november <year> interview with paste that the whole premise was such a joke and telling andrew purcell of the guardian in october <year> i have no qualms about admitting the fifty states project was a promotional gimmick
an arkansas @-@ related song was released through npr as the lord god bird and material intended for new jersey and new york became the bqe
all of the songs on illinois were written recorded engineered and produced by stevens with most of the material being recorded at the buddy project studio in astoria queens and in stevens brooklyn apartment
as with his previous albums stevens recorded in various locations with additional piano recorded in st
paul 's church in brooklyn strings and vocals performed in collaborators apartments electronic organ recorded in the new jerusalem recreational room in clarksboro new jersey and vibraphone played at carroll music studios in new york city
stevens mostly created the album without collaboration focusing on the writing performance and technical creation of the album by himself i was pretty nearsighted in the construction of illinois
i spent a lot of time alone a few months in isolation working on my own and in the studio
i let things germinate and cultivate independently without thinking about an audience or a live show at all
stevens employed low @-@ fidelity recording equipment which allowed him to retain creative control and keep costs low on recording illinois
typically his process involved recording to <num> khz <num> @-@ track tape using inexpensive microphones such as the shure <num> and akg c1000
he then employed pro tools for mixing and other production tasks
after consulting with michael kaufmann and lowell brams of asthmatic kitty about the amount of material he had recorded stevens decided against a double album saying that would be arrogant
in <year> several tracks recorded during these sessions were sent to seattle @-@ based musician and producer james mcallister for additional instrumentation and production and were released in <year> on the follow @-@ up album the avalanche outtakes and extras from the illinois album
among these outtakes are three separate recordings of the song chicago — including the multiple personality disorder version which was produced during a subsequent tour
the adult contemporary easy listening version of the song was supposed to appear on the illinois album but was changed at the last minute
illinois was released on july <num> <year> through rough trade records in europe and was distributed domestically by asthmatic kitty records starting july <num> <year>
although he initially had no plans to perform this material live less than two weeks after the release of illinois stevens embarked on a north american tour to promote the album performing with a string section of eight to ten members named the illinoisemakers
he deliberately chose to avoid television as a promotional tool and focused on the tour performances themselves
he was supported on some dates by opening acts liz janes who is also signed to asthmatic kitty and laura veirs as well as illinois collaborator shara nova 's solo project my brightest diamond
he toured in support of the album again from september through november <year> this time including dates in several european cities
during the <year> dates stevens and his band transitioned from wearing university of illinois @-@ themed outfits to butterfly suits and bird wings
the lyrics and their rich thematic elements have been noted for their literary quality earning comparisons to ralph waldo emerson henry david thoreau william carlos williams and walt whitman
stevens use of large orchestral arrangements in his music — much of it played by himself through the use of multi @-@ track recording — has been noted by several reviewers
rolling stone summarized the musical influences of illinois saying the music draws from high school marching bands show tunes and ambient electronics we can suspect steve reich 's music for <num> musicians is an oft @-@ played record in the stevens household since he loves to echo it in his long instrumental passages
a review in the a
v
club referred to some of the vocal work as regressively twee communalism but found stevens music overall to be highly developed
the song come on feel the illinoise uses a saxophone part from close to me by the cure
the creation of illinois marked a shift in stevens emphasis on songwriting and studio work toward live performance and more abstract concepts of motion and sound — subsequent tours and albums emphasized electronic music and modern dance over the indie folk material on michigan and illinois
he has ceased writing songs about individual characters with straightforward narratives or concept albums and briefly considered quitting the music business entirely after creating and promoting this album
he also found that the way in which he listened to music had changed after producing illinois i think now i listen more as a technician and a researcher
i 'm always hearing music in terms of what i can take out of it and i think i 've always listened like that
i have a hard time just listening for pleasure
i 'm much less about instinct and more of a utilitarian listener
like what is the use of this song what is the usefulness of this melody for this theme or statement what are they doing that 's unusual sounding and how can i learn from that stevens is a classically trained oboist and his knowledge of classical and baroque music influenced many of his arrangements
stevens himself has noted the influence of composers igor stravinsky sergei rachmaninoff and edvard grieg along with contemporary composers terry riley steve reich and philip glass
the music on this album was written to be grandiose to match the history of the territory
stevens used time signature changes in the composition of illinois for dynamic effect — for instance come on feel the illinoise begins with a <num> <num> time signature and then changes to a standard <num> <num> later in the song
concerning the ufo sighting near highland illinois is about a ufo sighting by police officers near highland illinois where several persons reported seeing a large triangular object with three lights flying at night
come on feel the illinoise makes reference to the world 's columbian exposition which took place in chicago in <year>
john wayne gacy jr
documents the story of the <num> chicago @-@ based serial killer of the same name
several lyrics make explicit references to events in his life w hen the swingset hit his head refers to an event in gacy 's childhood when a swing hit his head and caused a blood clot in his brain he dressed up like a clown for them with his face paint white and red alludes to the nickname given to gacy — the killer clown and he put a cloth on their lips quiet hands quiet kiss on the mouth references gacy 's use of chloroform to subdue and molest his victims
the song ends with the narrator turning inward with the lyrics and in my best behavior i am really just like him look beneath the floorboards for the secrets i have hid
stevens stated in a <year> interview with paste that we 're all capable of what gacy did
casimir pulaski day interweaves a personal story with the state holiday casimir pulaski day
the man of metropolis steals our hearts makes references to superman whose fictional hometown of metropolis was partially modeled after chicago the town of metropolis illinois has also capitalized on this association

as a christian he has written and recorded music about spiritual themes throughout his career — particularly on the <year> album seven swans — and prefers to talk about religious topics through song rather than directly in interviews or public statements
the song decatur or round of applause for your stepmother includes the line it 's the great i am — taken from the response god gave when moses asked for his name in the book of exodus exodus <num> <num>
casimir pulaski day describes the death of a girlfriend due to bone cancer and the narrator questions god in the process
more abstract allusions appear in the man of metropolis steals our hearts which utilizes superman as a christ figure and the seer 's tower which references the book of revelation and the second coming of christ
songs which were not written with an explicit theological focus — such as john wayne gacy jr
— also feature religious themes such as sin and redemption
the album cover reads sufjan stevens invites you to come on feel the illinoise as a wordplay on the common mispronunciation of the state 's name as ill @-@ i @-@ noyz and a reference to the slade song cum on feel the noize made famous in the united states by the metal band quiet riot

the type species of the genus mycena was first described scientifically in <year> but was not considered a mycena until <year>
it is quite variable in color size and shape which makes it somewhat difficult to reliably identify in the field
the mushrooms have caps with distinct radial grooves particularly at the margin
the cap 's color varies from grayish @-@ brown to dark brown and the shape ranges from bell @-@ like to bluntly conical to flattened with an umbo
the stem is hollow white tough and thin without a ring and often roots deeply into the wood on which it grows
the gills are white to grayish or even pinkish when mature and are connected by distinct cross @-@ veins
the caps can reach <num> cm <num>
<num> in in diameter and have a mealy odor and taste
the spore print is white and the gills are pink at maturity which can lead to possible confusion with species of the pluteus genus
m
galericulata mushrooms grow mostly in clusters on the well @-@ decayed stumps of deciduous and coniferous trees from spring to autumn
the species can generally be considered inedible
it is common and widespread in the entire temperate zone of the northern hemisphere but it has also been reported from africa
that same year samuel frederick gray transferred the species to the genus mycena
synonyms for the species include agaricus conicus named by william hudson in <year> agaricus crispus described by august johann georg karl batsch in <year> stereopodium galericulatum by franklin sumner earle in <year> and prunulus galericulatus by william alphonso murrill in <year>
mycena galericulata is the type species of the genus mycena
it is classified in section mycena of mycena in the infrageneric scheme of rudolph arnold maas geesteranus
in the older <year> classification of alexander h
smith he placed it in the subgenus eumycena section typicae — a most monotonous series of blackish brown gray bluish @-@ gray or brownish @-@ gray species mostly with ascending gills and generally large to moderate stature
the specific epithet galericulata is derived from the latin galer and means with a small hat
gray called it the helmetted high @-@ stool
it is commonly known as the common bonnet the toque mycena or the rosy @-@ gill fairy helmet
galericulata is roughly conical when young and eventually becomes broadly bell @-@ shaped or with a broad umbo that can reach diameters of <num> – <num> cm <num>
<num> – <num>
<num> in
the cap margin is initially somewhat curved inward but soon evens out or even becomes uplifted and often splits radially in age
the surface has radial grooves that extend nearly to the center and feels greasy but not sticky
the color is somewhat buff @-@ brown on the margin and fades gradually to pale dirty tan to dirty cinnamon @-@ brown
the flesh is thick in the center of the cap and tapers evenly to the margin and is watery gray with a cartilage @-@ like texture
the odor and taste are mildly to strongly farinaceous similar to the smell of freshly ground flour to radish @-@ like
the gills are narrowly attached adnexed to broadly attached or sinuate
the gill spacing ranges from close to somewhat distantly spaced with <num> – <num> gills reaching the stem there are additionally three or four tiers of lamellulae short gills that do not extend completely from the cap margin to the stem
the gills are strongly intervenose possessing cross @-@ veins moderately broad <num> – <num> mm white or grayish white soon flushed with pale pink with even edges
the stem is <num> – <num> cm <num>
<num> – <num>
<num> in long <num> – <num> mm <num>
<num> – <num>
<num> in thick equal in width throughout and with a cartilaginous texture
it is hollow not hairy either smooth or twisted with longitudinal striations often with a long pseudorrhiza a subterranean elongation of the stem at the base
the stem color is pale grayish @-@ white on the upper portion and pale grayish @-@ black below the base becomes somewhat dirty brown in age but does not develop reddish stains
mycena galericulata produces a white spore print
the spores are ellipsoid <num> – <num> by <num>
<num> – <num> μm and amyloid — which means they will turn blue @-@ black to black when stained with melzer 's reagent
the basidia spore @-@ bearing cells have stout sterigmata and measure <num> – <num> by <num> – <num> μm
they may be either two @-@ spored or four @-@ spored
there are numerous club @-@ shaped to rounded cheilocystidia cystidia on the gill edge that measure <num> – <num> by <num> – <num> μm their apices or the entire enlarged portion bear rodlike projections that become increasingly elongated and branched in age
there are no pleurocystidia cystidia on the gill face
the gill tissue has a very thin cuticle under which is a narrow hypoderm while the remainder of the tissue comprises densely matted tufts of mycelia and stains deep vinaceous @-@ brown in iodine
clamp connections are present in the hyphae of the four @-@ spored forms
one source considers them to have a delicate flavor and texture and suggests that they are good when stewed gently in their own juice and then seasoned with salt pepper and butter
others list the species as inedible and notes that they have a mildly rancid smell and with a taste ranging from rancid to farinaceous
another says unknown but not recommended
at any rate the species falls into the general category of brownish mycenas that are generally unappetizing as food due to their small size and delicate consistency
tintinnabulum is a northern european species that is much smaller cap diameter up to <num>
<num> cm <num>
<num> in across and has a brown cap and has ragged hairs at the base
it generally appears in late autumn to early winter on the stumps of deciduous trees especially beech
it has pip @-@ shaped spores that are smaller than m

<num> by <num>
<num> – <num>

maculata develops pink stains on its gills as it matures its spores are <num> – <num> by <num> – <num> μm
another similar species is m
inclinata which can be distinguished by gills bearing reddish spots which may become entirely red with age
it also has whitish slender threadlike flecks on the stalk
m
parabolica is thinner and more fragile
another mycena that grows in clusters on decaying hardwoods is m
haematopus but this species has a vinaceous @-@ brown cap with a scalloped margin and a stem that bleeds reddish @-@ brown juice when injured
m
excisa closely resembles m
galericulata but can be distinguished microscopically by the presence of both smooth and roughened cystidia bearing finger @-@ like projections
it can also grow from submerged wood which may give it a terrestrial appearance
it typically grows in small clusters or sometimes singly
the fungus fruits from late spring to early winter
a study of litter @-@ decomposing fungi in a coniferous forest in finland showed that m
galericulata produces extracellular hydrolytic enzymes in the humus and eluvial soil including β @-@ glucosidase β @-@ xylosidase α @-@ glucosidase butyrate esterase and sulphatase
the enzymes form complexes with inorganic and organic particles in the soil and break down depolymerize biopolymers such as cellulose hemicellulose and starch which contributes to the cycling of carbon and nutrients
the presence of lead contamination in the soil decreases both the growth and the extracellular hydrolytic enzyme activity of m
galericulata
mycena galericulata is a very common and widely distributed species found throughout the entire temperate zone of the northern hemisphere
in the united states it occurs throughout eastern north america and also along the pacific coast
it has also been collected in edo state nigeria
although the mushroom has occasionally been reported from australia these collections are probably based on misidentifications and australian records of mycena galericulata are best regarded as erroneous

crash boom bang is the first game to be released exclusively for the nintendo ds and the second party game of the series after crash bash
the game 's story centers on a multi @-@ millionaire who uses the characters of the series to unearth a powerful object dubbed the super big power crystal
the game has received largely negative reception from reviewers who criticized it for having unoriginal dull gameplay and poor controls
the game takes place among four players with the computer assigned to spare players
all players simultaneously roll dice
the number each player rolls is the amount of squares they move forward
depending on the type of square that the player lands on wumpa fruit which is used as points during the race can be won or lost an item can be obtained a special event might be triggered or a mini @-@ game might commence
if a player lands on a fork in the road the player will have to select the desired direction with either the stylus or the control pad
in the adventure mode the characters compete in a race for the super big power crystal
this race is made up of six stages each containing smaller sub @-@ maps
the host of the race the viscount sets a task for each stage
this task must be completed before the player can continue to another map
the player with the most points is the winner of the stage
the overall winner of all the stages is the winner of the viscount 's race
in the festival mode the gameplay is fundamentally the same as in the adventure mode with the exception of the ability to select stages to play freely
in the my room mode the player 's character has his or her own private room in which he or she can either play minigames that have been collected in adventure mode view a collection of items obtained in adventure mode or create a motion panel a unique in @-@ game communication tool can allow customized messages to be sent mid @-@ game to help friends or distract other players gameplay
the decorations in my room is different for each character
crash boom bang features forty mini @-@ games that can be played alone or remotely against friends
balance timing and intelligence are required to win these mini @-@ games
when a player is not taking part in a mini @-@ game he or she can bet wumpa fruit on the winner
the player can help players that have been bet on or obstruct players that have not been bet on by using the motion panel
if the player has a special item the player can access the shop screen from the bet screen and buy or sell items
the playable characters include crash bandicoot coco bandicoot crunch bandicoot pura doctor neo cortex tawna pinstripe potoroo and fake crash
all of the characters physically appear as they do in official japanese crash bandicoot artwork and promotions which was the only sierra entertainment video game to be introduced the official japanese crash bandicoot artwork and promotions though crash 's model was altered for the non @-@ japanese releases to closer resemble his crash twinsanity model
the host of the party the viscount is an original character designed specifically for the game
his name in the original japanese version is viscount devil a reference to the tasmanian devil native to australia
other past characters make cameos in the game at one point or another such as the lab assistants doctor n
gin tiny tiger doctor nefarious tropy and polar
aku aku serves as the player 's tutor while uka uka makes a cameo appearance as a purchaseable item in the shop
he attempts to find it himself but due to the large amount of puzzles he fails miserably
in the resort the viscount decides to gather up the world 's cleverest and strongest bunch of characters and con them into finding the crystal for him
he sends an invitation to coco bandicoot inviting her and crash to the world cannonball race where the winner earns <num> @,@ <num> @,@ <num>
the race starts in port town with the winners traveling in a boat to a large desert
legend has it that four stone tablets are buried somewhere in the desert and the contestants are sent out to dig for them and bring them to the viscount
according to the stone tablets the actual location of the crystal is hidden somewhere on the ancient map
before he can investigate the matter further doctor neo cortex swoops in and snatches the map
as the two struggle for the map the map is torn to shreds
cortex sends his loyal lab assistants to find the pieces of the map scattered throughout the big city and bring them to him
now that the contestants know about the map the viscount decides to reveal his true intentions the super big power crystal can grant a single wish who whoever obtains it and the viscount is willing to give a large sum of money to those who help him find it
finding the power crystal is impossible without the final key so the viscount boards his plane to travel to the north atlantic ocean in search for the final key
but the plane is full and only a select number of the contestants are able to board
propelled to the skies by an explosive volcano the contestants are able to board the viscount 's plane
on the viscount 's ship the viscount tells the group the story of an explorer who found the final key but was unable to find the power crystal
that explorer was the viscount 's grandfather
as the explorer sailed back to his homeland to recollect his thoughts his ship crashed into an iceberg and sank taking the viscount 's grandfather to a watery grave
sounds like a movie remarks one of the attendees
the viscount tells them to dive to the sunken ship and retrieve the final key much to their shock considering the near @-@ freezing temperatures
despite this the group is able to find the final key before freezing to death
with all the pieces of the puzzle at hand the viscount victoriously enters the tower where the super big power crystal awaits its owner
just as the viscount is about to make his wish crash steps forward and makes his wish of a large pile of wumpa fruit much to the viscount 's grief
may peace prevail on earth says coco
not wanting to make another multiplayer game where the players just pass the phone to each other and hoping to attract both old and new fans of the series the development team decided to integrate the mobile phone itself into the minigames creating such minigame gimmicks as playing with one hand behind the back with one eye closed playing with the chin etc
the biggest challenge for the team was keeping the minigames inside the phone 's memory which was cited as slightly inferior to the first playstation console
the warioware series was described as an influence in making the game
crash boom bang is the first game in the series to exclusively feature the japanese voice cast in all regional versions of the game
the voice cast includes makoto ishii in the dual role of crash and fake crash risa tsubaki as coco yōsuke akimoto as doctor cortex shinya fukumatsu as crunch akiko toda as tawna asuka tanii as pura and takahiro yoshino as pinstripe

there isn 't a whole lot that 's crash @-@ like about crash boom bang
nintendo power recommended the game only to die @-@ hard crash fans and advised others to wait for crash 's next outing
lesley smith of eurogamer criticized the game for a number or reasons including bad stylus recognition boring gameplay terrible graphics and rigged repetitive mini @-@ games
ign 's review was one of the most scathing dubbing crash boom bang a terrible terrible game with poor organization and easily one of the worst games on the system
more middling reviews have come in from official nintendo magazine who felt the game was hampered by dodgy controls and a testing user interface and pocket gamer 's jon jordan who dismissed the game 's collection of minigames as distinctly average and oddly passionless
despite the negative reception crash boom bang was the seventh best @-@ selling game in australia on the week of june <num> to june <num> <year>

singer shontelle and production duo rock city wrote the song with its main producer sham
they wrote it during a writing camp in los angeles of march <year> held by rihanna 's record label to gather compositions for possible inclusion on the then @-@ untitled album
rock city were inspired by bob marley 's <year> song i shot the sheriff and set out to create a song which embodied the same feel but female perspective
it is a reggae ballad which incorporates elements of ragga and electronic music
lyrically rihanna is a fugitive after she shoots a man an action she later regrets
several critics singled out man down as loud 's highlight while others commented on her prominent west indian accent and vocal agility
def jam released man down on may <num> <year> as the fifth single from the album
in the united states the single reached number <num> on the billboard hot <num> and number <num> on the hot r b hip @-@ hop songs chart
it has been certified double platinum by the recording industry association of america riaa
the song topped the chart in france for five consecutive weeks and reached the top three in belgium and the netherlands
anthony mandler directed its music video in which rihanna 's character shoots a man after he rapes her
the video was criticized by the parents television council industry ears and mothers against violence who faulted rihanna for suggesting that murder is an acceptable form of justice for rape victims
however actress gabrielle union a rape victim praised the video for being relatable
man down was on the set list for three of rihanna 's tours – the loud tour <year> the diamonds world tour <year> and the anti world tour <year>
def jam rented out nearly every recording studio in los angeles in order to create as many songs as possible
ray daniels the manager of musical duo rock city brothers theron and timothy thomas was present during the sessions and stated that a writing camp typically involves the label hiring ten recording studios for two weeks at the cost of <num> @,@ <num> per day
daniels revealed that it is where songwriters have lyrics but no music and where producers have music but no lyrics
shama joseph professionally known as sham was hired as one of the producers to work on crafting songs at the camp
sham 's manager had arranged his attendance at the camp through an acquaintance who was an employee of the record label
sham explained that he found a flight to los angeles and began working on music as soon as he arrived stating that he had nothing to lose and everything to gain
he was inspired by a vision of rihanna performing songs at a concert that were caribbean themed
sham felt that rihanna had not explored caribbean @-@ themed music since her debut album music of the sun <year>
sham played the music to them to which the brothers responded let 's give rihanna a one @-@ drop like a response to i shot the sheriff together sham and rock city wrote the lyrics to man down in twelve minutes
in an mtv news interview rock city said they intended to write a song that would embody bob marley 's i shot the sheriff <year> from a female perspective and to tap rihanna 's island origins in a way that sounded authentic
singer shontelle said that rihanna called her during the last girl on earth tour and asked her to be involved with the song
she confirmed that rihanna was present when she was writing her part in the recording studio
shontelle elucidated that following one of rihanna 's concerts the singer exited the stage and immediately returned to the tour bus to work in the studio
daniels said that once the writing camp had concluded rihanna listened to all of the songs which had been composed for her and chose her favorites
in september <year> several months after sham attended the writing camp rihanna called him and said that she wanted to record man down for inclusion on loud
rihanna later described the sentiment she wanted to express as gangsta and elaborated on how reggae culture has influenced her musical style i 'm super inspired by reggae music and it has been a part of me since i was born and i grew up listening to it
i was exciting for me to take this on as my own and do a song like this especially with the lyrics being like that
the track was composed during rihanna 's last girl on earth tour
the song 's instrumental was recorded by cary clark at the village in los angeles
kuk harrell produced rihanna 's vocals with josh gudwin and marcos tovar at westlake recording studios also in los angeles
bobby campbell assisted with vocal production and recording
the song was mixed by manny marroquin at larrabee sound studios in los angeles assisted by erik madrid and christian plata
daniels estimated the total cost of the writing camp to be approximately <num> @,@ <num> averaging <num> @,@ <num> for each of the eleven songs which were included on loud the camp consisted of forty writers and producers
daniels confirmed that rock city received <num> @,@ <num> and sham <num> @,@ <num> for their part in the production of man down
he said that to get that twelve minutes of inspiration from a top songwriting team is expensive — even before you take into account the fee for the songwriters
a cost of <num> @,@ <num> for man down was already incurred prior to rihanna entering the studio with a vocal producer
although makeba riddick did not serve as the song 's vocal producer daniels cited her as an example of how the process works and how much she would charge
it is the responsibility of the vocal producer to tell a singer how to sing the song correctly to achieve the desired sound
daniels said that riddick 's fee varies from <num> @,@ <num> to <num> @,@ <num> and that the final part of the process is for the song to be mixed and mastered which incurs a similar fee
he estimated the final cost of writing producing vocal producing mixing and mastering man down to be <num> @,@ <num>
when combined with the marketing and promotional costs the total expense was <num> @,@ <num> @,@ <num>
the song in the key of c minor has a tempo of <num> beats per minute
rihanna 's voice spans more than one and a half octaves from f3 to e ♭ <num>
slant magazine critic sal cinquemani described man down as one of rihanna 's most confident vocal performances with her strong barbadian patois
jon pareles of the new york times said that the singer plays up her west indian accent and august brown of the los angeles times described the vocals as reasserting her caribbean lilt
entertainment weekly writer leah greenblatt described man down as a song with island rhythms
lyrically rihanna is a fugitive after she shoots a man but later regrets it
rihanna slowly relays the chain of events which led up to the murder
she cries to her mother about the act that she has committed – mama i just shot a man down – expressing guilt and remorse for not meaning to kill her attacker and that he is somebody 's son
as the track develops rihanna 's bajan accent becomes stronger and exaggerated which climaxes during the bridge as she declares why deed i pull dee treeguh pull dee treeguh pull dee treeguh boom muumuse writer bradley stern thought that the track took on a confessional tone
on february <num> <year> rihanna was reported to have been involved in an altercation with her boyfriend chris brown
he allegedly punched rihanna and threatened to kill her
brown turned himself in to the police and pleaded guilty to misdemeanor assault during the trial
august brown called the murder ballad theme an apparent warning to chris brown and a response to his song deuces <year> which denounces an ex @-@ lover
kitty empire of the guardian wrote that brown 's assault on rihanna gives the song lyrical context and sings it with a bittersweet menace tone
when asked by hiphopdx about how he reacted to listeners of the song saying that it condones violence sham dismissed the accusations i didn ’ t think it made any sense
i think it was because of who it was saying i just shot a man down
i think it was very hypocritical for some of the parents against violence in media those same parents have probably allowed their kids to watch all types of movies and programs that have depictions or things that insinuate violence
so for them to be mad about number one an issue that actually exists
a woman feeling like she wants to shoot somebody who ’ s still alive because of something that they took from her that ’ s real and that ’ s honest
so the emotion is a very true emotion
and they relive it on a daily basis
i think it was crazy and blown out of proportion
but people benefit from controversy and those same people who probably were trying to bring awareness now they have a voice and now they ’ re specialists and they can speak for a group of people all of a sudden
after an influx of suggestions the singer said she had narrowed the options down to four songs man down california king bed cheers drink to that and fading
on march <num> she confirmed that california king bed had been selected as the next international single
however man down was sent to rhythmic and urban radio stations in the united states on may <num> before the may <num> release of california king bed making man down and california king bed the fifth and sixth singles from loud
the song was released in france and switzerland on july <num> and the netherlands on july <num>
kitty empire called the track excellent and praised it for being an original composition which is reminiscent of a righteous old reggae murder ballad
consequence of sound writer ryan burleson said that man down and another album track called fading both stand on their own sonically and that the former is an homage to her caribbean heritage with its dancehall melody
describing the track as breezy bradley stern thought that no other song on loud embodied rihanna 's personality more so than on man down
cinquemani chose man down as the best song on loud calling rihanna 's vocal agility surprising and noting that the fully @-@ fledged reggae song is co @-@ written by a fellow barbadian @-@ born singer shontelle
in her review of loud emily mackay of nme called its experimentation more organic than that on rihanna 's previous album rated r <year> citing man down s theme of doomed youth
similarly nima baniamer of contactmusic

rihanna told rap @-@ up that the video has a strong underlying message for girls like me on may <num> <year> three camera phone teaser photos of rihanna on a beach in a white dolce gabbana dress and riding a bicycle in portland parish were released
the music video premiered on bet 's <num> park on may <num> <year>
in an interview for mtv news mandler said that man down required a strong narrative and visual and that fans could expect something dramatic and shocking and intense and emotions and uplifting and enlightening
the video opens as the protagonist rihanna shoots and kills a man while he walks through a busy train station
she flees before a flashback to the previous day when she rides her bike meets friends and is alone in a bedroom at dusk
at a nightclub the protagonist dances and flirts with another club @-@ goer who then attacks her when she leaves the club
disheveled the woman cries in the street after an implied sexual assault and the video ends as she runs home to grab a gun hidden in a dresser drawer
in the chapter titled disclosures black women 's resistance to sexual violence hobson explores how black women have found the courage to speak out about sexual violence protest against it and not remain a silent victim
she recalled rihanna 's interview for <num> <num> with diane sawyer which aired on november <num> <year>
having remained silent about her altercation with brown on the evening of the grammy party in february that year whereby brown assaulted her rihanna decided to speak about it for the first time
the author noted how sawyer decided to approach the interview by presenting the couples relationship and assault case as an anomaly and accused rihanna of projecting a fake imagery of strong black woman rather than presenting her another domestic violence victim not only in the united states but in the world
i am strong rihanna responded
hobson wrote that from then on the singer decided to project an image of hardcore masculinity and dominatrix @-@ type femininity in her music trajectory
subsequently several of rihanna 's songs and music videos have courted controversy for their violent themes which hobson attributes to the leaking of a photo showing the singers battered face on the evening of the assault by tmz which circulated the internet without the permission of rihanna
hobson writes because of this rihanna has had to wrest back control of the victim image foisted on her and she in turn has challenged us rhetorically and visually to question and examine the power danger and violences that shape our relationships
she continued to highlight the music videos for russian roulette hard we found love love the way you lie with eminem which documents domestic violence and s m which contains references to bondage and fetishism and is in part rihanna 's response to disparaging critics as examples
at one point in the video for s m rihanna is literally tied up as a victim
however hobson noted that rihanna rejects the victim stance in the video for man down and elucidated that she played the role of a rape survivor who shot her attacker
she attributed the location of shooting the video in jamaica as significant due to how the image of a gun proliferated during <num> jamaican dance hall 's to express female rage
the prologue depicts rihanna as a dark @-@ hooded femme fatale whereby the narrative explains her motives for murder and provokes the spectator to sympathize with her because she danced in a provocative manner with a man in a club which hobson suggests is somehow deserving of rape
she continued to explain that rihanna is inviting the audience to consider what justice means by pointing both a literal and lyrical gun at the issue
hobson concluded that rihanna is protecting her vulnerability and countering the image of the abused black woman who is looked at unsympathetically in society
beck bain of idolator described the video as visually stunning while metro writer lee ann labelled it as shocking
co @-@ writer of man down theron thomas felt that the video was very theatrical and that rihanna played her role perfectly
he continued to say that had the video been a lyric @-@ by @-@ lyric representation the narrative would have been more graphic
the group disagreed with rihanna 's rationale for the storyline that the video has a very strong underlying message for girls like rihanna
according to the ptc and industry ears if chris brown murdered a woman in a video that premiered on bet the world would stop and rihanna should not have been allowed to release her clip
the week before the council 's statement about the video it had objected to rihanna and britney spears performance of the s m remix at the billboard music awards having called it a profanity @-@ laced s m sex show on prime @-@ time broadcast television
after the ptc 's statement julianne escobedo shepherd of alternet wrote that the group seemed to employ a double standard it had not condemned kanye west 's music video for monster in which dead women hang from ceilings and west holds a decapitated head
shepard added that eminem and rihanna 's video for love the way you lie had not been criticized despite glorified and romanticized domestic violence
a mothers against violence spokesperson criticised rihanna for failing to present a solution rather than encouraging the vulnerable youth for which rape is a reality for many people
director anthony mandler addressed the controversy in an interview for the hollywood reporter saying that the visual evoked the reaction he intended and that it highlighted an issue still taboo in modern society
he recalled growing up in an era in which artists such as madonna released controversial music videos and noted that contemporary videos no longer tackle taboo subjects as frequently
rihanna responded to the ptc 's criticism on twitter and said that parents should not expect her to parent their children and that touchy subject matters should not be hidden from children otherwise they will not learn how to adapt in society and that it empowers abusers even more because children are embarrassed to talk about rape
the singer continued to state that the industry isn 't parent 's r us and that singers have the freedom to create art
in an interview for bet rihanna further explain why rape was used as the vehicle to push the story forward in the video despite the lyrics not mentioning rape saying making that into a mini @-@ movie or video we needed to go back to why it happened
obviously she 's not a cold @-@ blooded killer
it had to be something so offensive
and we decided to hone in on a very serious matter that people are afraid to address especially if you 've been victimized in this scenario
rihanna added that the character is remorseful for her actions
actress and women 's @-@ health advocate gabrielle union a rape victim voiced support for the video on twitter
union called it brave and although she did not agree with the eye @-@ for @-@ an @-@ eye sentiment she could relate to the situation
union said that every rape victim or survivor is a unique situation and that they all have an idea of how justice should be served
she admitted that she tried to shoot her rapist but missed and that she has since realised that committing murder as a form of justice for herself would not have made the situation better
she continued to say that while it is understandable to desire to kill a rapist unless it is in self @-@ defense then it is not advisable
for the loud tour rihanna performed the song on a levitating rotating platform a conveyer belt and graffiti @-@ laden car shell
although kitty empire described man down as terrific the critic felt let down by the baffling lack of creativity from rihanna 's production team for the stage set up during rihanna 's performance
she wrote that she did not understand why a truck bonnet was in the middle of the stage
maza praised the tracks placement on the set @-@ list
man down was performed as the fourth song on the loud tour following its opener only girl in the world disturbia and shut up and drive
maza noted that the tempo of man down should have slowed down the momentum she 'd accumulated until then but that was instead an ideal marriage of production and performance
instead the red lights on the stage played up the ominous tone of the song as it gradually increased its tempo to the point whereby the end of the song was on the verge of sounding like an incantation
for the diamonds world tour rihanna performed man down in a caribbean @-@ theme section of the show which also included you da one no love allowed what 's my name and rude boy
james lachno of the telegraph highlight the caribbean @-@ themed section as the show 's highlight
manchester evening news writer katie fitzpatrick commented that rihanna transported the audience to the caribbean with a grinding groove
however gary graff of the oakland press was disappointed with the lack of variety in the section writing that it was addled by a sonic sameness even with nuno bettencourt of extreme whose guitar was buried in the bass @-@ heavy mix playing some intriguing licks and accents
british singer and songwriter leona lewis performed a mashup of man down with her <year> single better in time at bbc radio <num> 's live lounge in june <year>
she also included the mashup on the set list of her <year> glassheart tour
her rendition received a mixed response from critics
katherine hollisey @-@ mclean of the worthing herald complimented the fusion of better in time with reggae beats
but the guardian 's malcolm jack thought the performance was cringeworthy and called lewis a reasonably priced rihanna
it first aired on october <num> <year> on the upn network within the united states
the story was created by executive producers rick berman and brannon braga with a teleplay by david wilcox
a similar premise had been included in the original pitch for star trek by gene roddenberry
set in the <num> century the series follows the adventures of the first starfleet starship enterprise registration nx @-@ <num>
in this episode while in search of deuterium enterprise discovers a mining colony that is being controlled by klingons who are bullying the inhabitants and hoarding their supplies

<num> million viewers the second highest audience for an episode of the second season
reviews were mixed with some critics responding negatively to the lack of consequences from the fighting sequences while another praised the characters interactions and felt it was a good example of the western genre
they initially try to barter with tessic larry cedar the colony 's leader but he appears reluctant to part with any of the <num> @,@ <num> liters in inventory which is being held for someone else
after negotiations however a deal is struck − <num> liters of deuterium for four power cells and whatever medical supplies enterprise can spare on the proviso that the enterprise crew can fix two offline pumps in two days
despite deuterium being a valuable commodity archer is startled by the lack of basic medical supplies and the run @-@ down nature of the colony
the reason becomes apparent when seven klingons show up to collect deuterium according to their regular arrangement
when tessic informs korok robertson dean the leader of the klingons that they do not have all the deuterium because two pumps were not working korok hits him and gives them four days to meet the order
later when tucker and archer attempt to talk them into fighting against the klingons tessic tell them to take their <num> liters and leave
however leaving does not sit well with archer and he convinces the leader to resist with their support
on enterprise t 'pol teaches some of the colonists how to evade edged @-@ weapon attacks from vulcan martial @-@ art suus @-@ mahna while ensign hoshi sato linda park and lieutenant malcolm reed dominic keating teach other colonists how to fire their weapons more accurately

when the klingon marauders arrive the colony appears deserted and silent
finally the defenders show themselves and in the ensuing fight the klingons are lured into an area surrounded by the capped @-@ off deuterium well heads
on cue the wells are ignited surrounding the klingons with flames
tessic then tells the klingons to leave and never come back
after they depart archer is rewarded with <num> @,@ <num> liters of deuterium by the grateful miners

maçek iii while writing for the website popmatters described marauders as forming the first part of a loose trilogy of episodes within the second season focusing on re @-@ introducing the klingons to the series
the following episodes in the group were said to be judgment and bounty
jamahl epsicokhan at his website jammer 's reviews gave the episode two out of four said that there was nothing exciting in marauders and that the action sequences towards the end were unrealistic because despite all the apparent violence not a single person even gets injured during the scene
he called the general premise classic trek but that it lacked depth and didn 't pose any interesting questions
he summed it up by saying it was a bloodless light @-@ as @-@ a @-@ feather action show with handsome production values but absolutely and positively no edge
michelle erica green reviewing the episode for treknation said that the episode seemed to follow the same story as the <year> animated film a bug 's life but was very much set in the western genre which inspired roddenberry 's original star trek pitch with other comparisons to the <year> film the magnificent seven
she felt that there was several scenes which enabled some character building moments for hoshi travis mayweather and tucker and described it overall as a decent genre piece with good character work
the first home media release of marauders was part of the season two dvd box set released in the united states on august <num> <year>
a release on blu @-@ ray disc for season two occurred on august <num> <year>
an inside forward he played more than <num> games for brighton hove albion and more than <num> for each of chelsea and crystal palace
mcnichol graduated from junior footballer and apprentice motor mechanic in his native scotland to a professional contract with english first division club newcastle united
after two years he had found success with the reserve team but was never selected in the first eleven
brighton hove albion struggling in the third division broke their transfer record to sign him
mcnichol spent four years with the club acquiring the reputation as the finest inside @-@ forward in the third division before moving to the first division as chelsea manager ted drake 's first signing
he was part of the chelsea team that won the league championship in the <year> – <num> season
in <year> he joined crystal palace whom he captained to promotion from the fourth division and finished his on @-@ field career in the southern league as player @-@ manager of tunbridge wells rangers
he then spent <num> years working on the commercial side of football with two of his previous clubs
his father danny died when he was five so mcnichol and seven siblings were raised by their mother catherine
he attended st joseph 's school in kilmarnock and started work as a messenger boy for a local draper 's shop when he left school
his shop work stopped him playing football on saturdays but he was able to play some midweek football for junior club hurlford united
when he was taken on at the local bus garage as an apprentice motor mechanic he became available on saturdays as well
hurlford paid him ten shillings a game nearly as much as his apprentice 's wages
during the second world war mcnichol was called up to the fleet air arm as a mechanic but was able to play friendly matches for inverness @-@ based club clachnacuddin
because of the number of professional players stationed around the country such matches were played at a fairly high standard
after two trial matches he signed professional forms with the club on his 21st birthday
mcnichol spent two years at newcastle but never made a first @-@ team appearance
behind the likes of england international forwards roy bentley and len shackleton in the pecking order he doubled his income working as a motor mechanic for a local funeral director whose two or three rolls @-@ royces made a nice change from working on bus engines
in his second season he was part of the reserve team that won the central league title but a disagreement over personal terms on his contract renewal – the newcastle management felt a lower wage was justified because of the player 's earnings outside the game – prompted mcnichol to seek first @-@ team football elsewhere
he made his first appearance in the league on <num> august <year> at the age of <num> as brighton drew with swindon town at home
the club finished sixth in the division in mcnichol 's first season and eighth despite having no regular goalscorer – mcnichol 's nine goals made him top scorer – in <year> – <num>
the next year mcnichol played in all of brighton 's games the only man so to do and again finished as top scorer for the season this time with <num> goals
according to carder and harris he had a superb season with a brand of play which won him the reputation as the finest inside @-@ forward in the third division
appointed club captain when billy lane took over from welsh as manager mcnichol flourished under lane 's attacking policy
he scored <num> goals in the <year> – <num> season as brighton narrowly failed to mount a successful challenge to plymouth argyle for the title was again the star of the side and was thought by many to be the most stylish inside @-@ forward to play for the albion
that season mcnichol scored a hat @-@ trick against eventual runners @-@ up reading which caught the eye of manager ted drake
shortly before the next season started he became drake 's first signing for his new club chelsea at a fee of £ <num> @,@ <num> plus the player jimmy leadbetter a club record fee received for albion
he had scored <num> goals in all competitions from <num> appearances
although scouts from bigger clubs had been watching the player since soon after his arrival at the club – he had apparently already turned down moves to manchester city everton and huddersfield town – brighton 's supporters were disappointed seeing his sale as a backward step
once restored to the forward line his goals helped chelsea avoid relegation to the second division at the end of his first season
a dramatic last @-@ minute goal
enabled chelsea to snatch a lucky victory at west bromwich with three games left and he scored the third goal of chelsea 's <num> – <num> defeat of manchester city in their last fixture of the season which confirmed their escape from the relegation positions
two seasons later chelsea won the first division title for the first time
as they beat charlton athletic in march <year> to maintain their challenging position in the championship the times reporter described how mcnichol filled the role of general and was instigator of many dangerous movements
two weeks later mcnichol the most effective of their forwards scored twice as a chelsea team displaying a propensity to play the man in preference to the ball beat tottenham hotspur <num> – <num> and the title was confirmed with one game still to play
mcnichol had missed only two games in the <num> @-@ game season and scored <num> goals a good return for a player in his position an inside forward was normally more a creator than a scorer of goals but his profile on chelsea 's website describes him as clever astute and most of all a clinical finisher
he stayed at the club for three more seasons but later lost his place in the side to the young jimmy greaves there was no disgrace in losing my place to him
i couldn 't grumble about that
we used to get on very well and he would listen to the instructions i gave him
then he became world famous the respect was mutual though greaves described the chelsea title @-@ winning side as almost certainly one of the least talented teams ever to win the title he made an exception for mcnichol the ball player of the team
in all competitions he made <num> appearances for chelsea and scored <num> goals
while at brighton mcnichol had worked in a local garage wanting to keep up his skills in case injury put an early end to his football career
when he joined chelsea his decision to remain living in the area had upset drake
in addition he bought a newsagent 's shop in hove so not only did he have to travel by train from the south coast – as did teammates stan willemse and eric parsons – he further annoyed the chelsea management by getting up even earlier each morning to open the shop before coming in to training
his wife connie whom he had known since childhood ran the business in his absence
he claimed to have earned more working in that shop than playing for chelsea
even in that championship season
he was expected to fill a role similar to the one he has performed so well at stamford bridge – helping in the development of promising young forwards and was appointed captain
he scored on his debut for the club and produced seven goals from the twelve games he played in what remained of the <year> – <num> season
by october <year> manager george smith felt the player was feeling the strain of his dual role so relieved him of the captaincy
as mcnichol grew older his playing position became more defensive as he became first a wing half then a full back
palace had been placed in the fourth division when the football league structure was reorganised on national lines prior to the <year> – <num> season and mcnichol long since restored to the captaincy led them to promotion to the third division in <year> their first promotion for <num> years
soon afterwards he applied for the managerial post at former club brighton hove albion then in the second division but was unsuccessful
a broken arm suffered in august <year> forced mcnichol to miss a palace match for the first time in a three @-@ and @-@ a @-@ half @-@ year club career
he played on for two seasons but his professional career was brought to a close by facial injuries a fractured cheekbone and broken jaw sustained during the <year> – <num> season
in all competitions he scored <num> goals from <num> appearances
having sold the newsagents he returned to crystal palace to work in the commercial side of the game where he was responsible for the establishment of weekly pools and bingo competitions as a means of raising funds for the club
he moved back to brighton hove albion to occupy a similar role from <year> to <year> and after retirement continued to live in the saltdean area of brighton
despite the successes of his career mcnichol had regrets
he described chelsea 's decision not to accept their invitation to participate in the inaugural season of the european cup as his one big disappointment and thought it was strange at the time despite the national team selectors preference for players plying their trade for scottish clubs that he was never chosen to represent his country
mcnichol retained contact with his previous clubs
one of <num> former players and managers nominated as albion legends as part of brighton 's centenary events in <year> he took an active role in the celebrations
the surviving members of chelsea 's <year> title @-@ winning team used to meet for an annual dinner and were guests of the club at the last match of the <year> – <num> season as they celebrated their second league title <num> years after the first
he died of a stroke on <num> march <year> at the age of <num>

during the <num> century a significant amount of church rebuilding and restoration work took place throughout anglesey and st peulan 's was given a new roof and new internal fittings at this time
it is now a redundant church and has been in the hands of the friends of friendless churches since <year> it is one of four churches on anglesey for which the charity has responsibility
the charity holds a <num> @-@ year lease with effect from <num> june <year>

the building has a slate roof with copings of stone
at the west end there is a gabled bellcote with one bell crosses made of iron are fixed to the roofs of the chancel and south chapel
the nave of the church which has two bays was probably built in the <num> century
an entrance at the west end of the nave has been blocked up and plastered over on the outside
the chancel which is smaller than the nave and a chapel on the south side of the building attached to the nave were added in the <num> century and the arches dividing the nave from the chapel and the chancel are of this date
the entrance door from the <num> century is positioned on the east side of the chapel and has a pointed archway

it has been suggested that the hemispheres are bee skeps
one of the longer sides has a row of arches forming an arcade above a pattern of lozenges
the other shorter side has a chequerwork pattern
the archeologist david petts has noted that it is one of a number of fonts on anglesey that has an area with little or no carving perhaps because it was never anticipated that the plain side of the font would be seen or because the font was carved after being put in its position in the church
although similar in style to other anglesey fonts its rectangular shape is unique according to petts and the cross on one side finds no parallels among fonts of this period
one writer the historian peter lord has suggested that it was initially used as an altar
accepting the <num> @-@ century dating lord stated that as an altar of the pre @-@ norman period it is a unique survivor in wales and indeed in britain
petts considers this unlikely suggesting that it may originally have been a reliquary

it has also been called the best of anglesey 's remarkable romanesque series
it has similarities of design and style with the fonts of two other churches on anglesey st llwydian 's church heneglwys and st iestyn 's church llaniestyn and with one of the stone crosses at st seiriol 's church penmon
it was given this status on <num> april <year> and has been listed because it is a rural medieval church retaining its simple character
it is described by cadw the welsh assembly government body responsible for the built heritage of wales as a church of typical anglesey type where the <num> @-@ century restoration work has retained the simplicity of design and construction and also the church 's medieval character
in the <num> century the writer samuel lewis said that it was small and of rude workmanship but had several curious features such as the font that made it valuable
the antiquarian angharad llwyd writing in <year> described it as a small cruciform structure situated in a little barren valley with the south transept bearing evidence of very great antiquity
she stated that there were some windows in the later english style of good design especially the east window of the chancel which is a very superior composition

when the rightful owners return they drive off again
the tramps continue in their venture and quickly make a large sum of money before they desire their old way of life
the two tramps then surrender the office to its rightful owners
the appearance of the word and its usage was popularized in the <num> and often applied as a literal definition of a tramp a traveling long @-@ term homeless person who engages in dentistry
the term was not exclusive to the united states as noted in tracey adams 's a dentist and a gentleman gender and the rise of dentistry in ontario which refers to local blacksmiths and gunsmiths who would pull teeth and even create dentures of questionable effectiveness and quality

described as the most organized of the northern arabian tribes at the peak of its power in the <num> century bce it controlled a large region between the persian gulf and the sinai peninsula
biblical tradition holds that the qedarites are named for qedar the second son of ishmael mentioned in the bible 's books of genesis <num> <num> and <num> chronicles <num> <num> where there are also frequent references to qedar as a tribe
the earliest extrabiblical inscriptions discovered by archaeologists that mention the qedarites are from the neo @-@ assyrian empire
spanning the <num> and <num> centuries bce they list the names of qedarite kings who revolted and were defeated in battle as well as those who paid assyrian monarchs tribute including zabibe queen of the arabs šar @-@ rat kur
a @-@ ri @-@ bi
there are also aramaic and old south arabian inscriptions recalling the qedarites who further appear briefly in the writings of classical greek such as herodotus and roman historians such as pliny the elder and diodorus
it is unclear when the qedarites ceased to exist as a separately defined confederation or people
allies with the nabataeans it is likely that they were absorbed into the nabataean state around the <num> century ce
in islam isma 'il is considered to be the ancestral forefather of the arab people and in traditional islamic historiography muslim historians have assigned great importance in their accounts to his first two sons nebaioth and qedar with the genealogy of muhammad a messenger of god in islam alternately assigned to one or the other son depending on the scholar
though the tribal name is arabic it was first transcribed in assyrian <num> century bce and aramaic <num> century bce as the arabic alphabet had not yet been developed
in the mareshah onomasticon the qedarites are listed as an ethnic group whose name in aramaic transliteration is qdryn
the arabic triliteral root q @-@ d @-@ r means to measure compute estimate to decree appoint ordain and to have power or ability
qidr a noun derived from the same root means cauldron kettle and also gives the verbal derivation to cook
ernst axel knauf a biblical scholar who undertook a historical study of the ishmaelites and determined that they were known in assyrian inscriptions as the šumu 'il surmises that the name of the qedarites was derived from the verb qadara with its meaning of to ordain to have power
as this etymology is a deduction based solely on the prominence of the qedar among the šumu 'il tribes it is viewed as inconclusive by other scholars
according to philip j
king theologian and historian they lived in the northwest arabian desert and were an influential force from the <num> to <num> centuries bce
geoffrey bromiley historical theologist and translator transcribes their name as kedar and states they lived in an area southeast of damascus and east of the transjordan
<num> century bce assyrian inscriptions place the qedarites as living in the area to the east of the western border of babylon
moving further east into areas of the transjordan and southern syria in the <num> century bce by the <num> century bce they had spread into the sinai and as far as the nile delta
qedarite domination of northwest arabia involved alliances between the kings of qedar and the kings of dedan al-`ula
historian israel eph 'al writes that the breadth of qedarite distribution suggests a federation of tribes with various sub @-@ divisions
oases in the largely desert region lived in by the qedarites such as dedan tayma and dumah played an important role as sites of settlement trade and watering @-@ places
dumah a remote desert city to the west known later as dumat al @-@ jandal and today as al @-@ jawf was the most important of these sitting as it did between the empires of babylonia and assyria
serving as the base for qedarite religious ceremonies dumah 's strategic position on the north @-@ south trade route in the area meant that relations with its inhabitants were sought after by both empires though dumah and the qedarites were closer in both geographical and political terms to babylonia
those coming from the south and wishing to access mesopotamia were obliged to pass through dumah which also lay on an alternate route to the northwest leading to the city of damascus and from there on to assyria and anatolia
during the period of persian imperial rule in the region c

together with an army from elam this alliance faced the forces of sennacherib on the assyrian king 's first campaign in <num> bce
the events of the battle are recorded in the annals of sennacherib which describe yatie as queen of the arabs and tell of the capture of her brother baasqanu in battle
israel eph 'al writes that this is the first mention in assyrian documents of arabs as an ethnic element in babylonia
statements about the qedarites in the annals of the assyrian kings of ashurbanipal and his son esarhaddon indicate that the term kedar was almost synonymous with arabia
hazael who ruled c
<num> – <num> bce is described as a qedarite king by ashurbanipal and king of the arabs by esarhaddon
after sennacherib 's invasion of babylonia in <num> – <num> bce hazael fled to dumah
dumah is referred to as adummatu by the assyrians and the city is described by them as the seat of the qedar confederation and the base of their cult
te 'elkhunu and tabua both referred to as both queens of qidri and queens of aribi have adummatu explicitly denoted as their seat and capital city in the inscriptions
while the capital city for the three other queens referred to as queens of aribi samsi zabibe and yatie is not explicitly mentioned it is thought to have been adummatu as well
numerous inscriptions discovered in dumah itself are further indications for a strong qedarite presence one of which asks of three deities known to the assyrians as gods of qedar ruda nuha and atarsamain for help in the matter of my love
the conquest of adummatu by sennacherib in <num> bce and the capture of a qedarite queen te 'elkhunu who was brought back to assyria with other loot including divine images is also mentioned in the annals of the assyrian monarchs
esarhaddon eventually returned the renewed images of the arab gods to adummatu with tabua who grew up in the palace of sennacherib and was appointed qedarite queen by esarhaddon to replace te 'elkhunu
however strained relations between the assyrians and the qedarites meant that she ruled for only a brief period with esarhaddon recognizing hazael as the king of qedar after he increased his tribute to the assyrian monarch by <num> camels
esarhaddon then appointed yauta son of hazael as a qedarite king following hazael 's death
that yauta paid a tribute in the form of <num> minas of gold <num> @,@ <num> precious stones <num> camels and <num> @,@ <num> leather pouches of aromatics is also recorded
the defeat of ammuladi and yauta after they mounted qedarite forces to march against the kings of the amurru is recorded by ashurbanipal
yauta is said to have roused the people of arabia to revolt with him
his wife adiya is the only woman mentioned in assyrian inscriptions as both a qedarite queen and the wife of a qedarite king and is thought to be the only woman who was not a ruler in her own right
the inscriptions record how adiya was sent by yauta to accompany ammuladi and the qedarite forces and their subsequent defeat and capture in <num> bce by the forces of kamushaltu king of moab and a loyal vassal of the assyrian empire
yauta is said to have fled to the nabataeans
his subsequent capture and sentencing in nineveh are recorded by ashurbanipal who relates that i put a dog chain upon him and made him guard a kennel
abiyate was appointed as yauta 's successor and soon joined with the nabataeans to revolt against assyria again prompting ashurbanipal to launch a three @-@ month campaign to end it beginning in palmyra continuing on to damascus and ending in the southern part of al @-@ leja
graffiti found in al @-@ ula known as the graffito of niran at dedan mentions gashmu i son of shahr i as king of qedar
a king of qedar is also mentioned in a late <num> century bce aramaic inscription on a silver vessel found at tell maskhuta in the eastern nile delta in lower egypt
the inscription names him as qainū son of gashmu with the vessel described as an offering to han- ilāt
while it does not specifically mention the qedar and is therefore a subject of debate an aramaic inscription dating to <num> century bce discovered on an incense altar at lachish and dedicated to iyas son of mahaly the king is interpreted by andré lemaire as a possible reference to kings of qedar
the qedarites and nabataens were known to enjoy close relations even engaging as wartime allies against the assyrians
it is possible that the qedarites were eventually incorporated into the nabataen state which emerged as the strongest ishmaelite presence in northwestern arabia c
the <num> century ce
in the cambridge ancient history some of the arab nabataens mentioned by diodorus in his retelling of events that took place in <num> bce are said to be qedarites
pliny the elder <num> – <num> ce who refers to the cedrei and cedareni cedarenes in the context of other arabian tribes placing their domain to the south of the conchlei and adjacent to that of the nabataei is thought to be referring to the qedar
jerome c
<num> – <num> ce also writing in latin transcribes qedar as cedar and refers to it as a region
in one entry he describes it as a region of the saracens who are called ishmaelites in scripture in another he writes that it was a once uninhabitable region across saracen arabia and in a third he writes that it is a deserted region of the ishmaelites whom they now call saracens
according to the catholic encyclopedia theodoret c
<num> – c
<num> mentions that in his time the qedar lived near babylon
drawing on biblical motfis comparisons are made between the bedouins and the qedar
for example albert augustus isaacs describes the imposing spectacle of a bedouin encampment on a plain upon which the black tents of kedar were spread far and wide
an earlier account by charles boileau elliot describes the arabs as falling into two main groups fellahs and bedouins and identifies the latter with ishmael and the qedar as follows
the bedouins still retain the wandering habits of their father ishmael their hand is against every man and every man 's hand is against them the wild desert is their home the ground their pallet and their canopy the sky or if luxurious their choicest place of sojourn is a little tent black as the tents of kedar their progenitor
charles forster identifies the arab tribe of the beni harb as the modern descendants of the kedar
he proposes that beni harb sons of war is a patronym and nom de guerre that was adopted by the tribe at least <num> @,@ <num> years ago replacing kedar as the national moniker
the bible refers to both the qedarites and qedar frequently
old testament references include genesis <num> <num> isaiah <num> <num> @-@ <num> <num> <num> <num> <num> jeremiah <num> <num> <num> <num> @-@ <num> ezekiel <num> <num> and chronicles <num> <num>
twice qedar is used to refer to the actual son of ishmael as in the books of genesis and chronicles while remaining references are to his descendants referring either to his most prominent north arabian sons or to the arabs and bedouins as a more general collective
the tents of kedar equated with the peace @-@ hating meshech mentioned in the book of psalms <num> <num> were likely a qedarite sub @-@ group
in canticles <num> <num> the tents of the qedarites are described as black black i am but beautiful ye daughters of jerusalem as tents of qedar as tentcloth of salam black
their tents are said to be made of black goat hair
a tribe of salam was located just south of the nabateans in madain salih and knauf proposed that the qedarites mentioned in this masoretic text were in fact nabataeans and played a crucial role in the spice trade in the <num> century bce
biblical descriptions indicate there were two major types of qedarites nomads arabic wabariya living in tents and sedentary people arabic ḥaḍariya living in villages
jeremiah describes them as a nation at ease that dwells securely <num> <num> and notes that they engage in the pagan practice of shaving their temples
isaiah recalls their warrior activities and skill with the bow
<num> 16f ezekiel associates arabia and all the princes of kedar and indicates that they engaged in sheep goat trading with the phoenicians
the three books list the flocks of the qedarites as including lambs rams goats and camels
jeremiah also tells of a campaign by nebuchadnezzar <num> – <num> bce against the qedarites during the babylonian period
gashmu the king of the qedarites mentioned in the <num> century bce aramaic inscription described above is also referred to as geshem the arab or geshem the arabian by nehemiah who lists him as one of his adversaries since gashmu stands opposed to nehemiah 's governorship over judea in <num> bce
like other nomadic groups they lived primarily in unfortified encampments
pastoralists and traders in livestock such as male lambs rams and goats they also played a key role in the prosperity of gaza 's incense trade controlling traffic in the desert regions between egypt and palestine
as a result of their trading activities there were clans from among the qedarites that became wealthy
though they were vassals under assyrian rule and were often engaged in rebellion against that empire the rise to dominance of the persian empire proved beneficial to the qedarites
qedarite control of the trade routes and the access they afforded the persians translated into what herodotus described as a friendly relationship
early arab tribal groups like the qedarites spoke early arab dialects but as the arabic alphabet had not yet been developed they used the aramaic alphabet to write
the tongue of kedar is used in rabbinical sources as a name for the arabic language
papponymy the practice of naming boys after their grandfathers was common among the qedar
some qedarites had aramaic personal names e
g
hazael or haza @-@ el while others had arabic personal names e
g
gashmu and zabibe
aramaic civilization and its peoples were gradually absorbed by the arabs with arabic dialects in lebanon palestine syria and iraq in particular exhibiting the influence of aramaic
divine images of the gods and goddesses worshipped by qedarite arabs as noted in assyrian inscriptions included representations of atarsamain nuha ruda daa abirillu and atarquruma
the female guardian of these idols usually the reigning queen served as a priestess apkallatu in assyrian texts who communed with the other world
as mentioned above there is also evidence that the qedar worshipped al @-@ lāt to whom the inscription on a silver bowl from a king of qedar is dedicated
in the babylonian talmud which was passed down orally for centuries before being transcribed c
<num> ce in tractate taanis folio 5b it is said that most qedarites worshiped pagan gods
biblical figures three generations forward from terah are invariably described as the eponymous founders of different tribes and polities that interacted with the kingdom of judah between the <num> and <num> centuries bce
such is the case of the qedarite arabs who according to biblical tradition are the offspring of the abraham @-@ ishmael @-@ kedar genealogical line
the majority of sayyid believe they are one of the modern day descendants of muhammad and that they are therefore the descendants of ishmael and his second son qedar
abu ja 'far al @-@ baqir <num> – <num> ce wrote that his father ali ibn husayn informed him that mohammed had said the first whose tongue spoke in clear arabic was ishmael when he was fourteen years old
hisham ibn muhammad al @-@ kalbi <num> – <num> ce established a genealogical link between ishmael and mohammed using writings that drew on biblical and palmyran sources and the ancient oral traditions of the arabs
his book jamharat al @-@ nasab the abundance of kinship seems to posit that the people known as arabs are all descendants of ishmael
ibn kathir <num> – <num> writes all the arabs of the hijaz are descendants of nebaioth and qedar
medieval jewish sources also usually identified qedar with arabs and or muslims
according to author and scholar irfan shahîd western scholars viewed this kind of genealogical ishmaelism with suspicion seeing it as
a late islamic fabrication because of the confusion in islamic times which made it such a capacious term as to include the inhabitants of the south as well as the north of the arabian peninsula
but shorn of this extravagance the concept is much more modest in its denotation and in the sober sources it applies only to certain groups among the arabs of pre @-@ islamic times
some important statements to this effect were made by muhammed when he identified some arabs as ishmaelites and others as not
ishmaelism in this more limited definition holds that ishmael was both an important religious figure and eponymous ancestor for some of the arabs of western arabia
prominence is given in arab genealogical accounts to the first two of ishmael 's twelve sons nebaioth arabic نبيت nabīt and qedar arabic قيدار qaydār who are also prominently featured in the genesis account
it is likely that they and their tribes lived in northwestern arabia and were historically the most important of the twelve ishamelite tribes
in accounts tracing the ancestry of mohammed back to ma 'ad and from there to adam arab scholars alternate with some citing the line as through nebaioth others qedar
popular launched it under their fictioneers imprint which they used for magazines paying writers less than one cent per word
frederik pohl was hired in late <year> at <num> years old to edit the magazine he also edited astonishing stories a companion science fiction publication
pohl left in mid @-@ <year> and super science stories was given to alden h
norton to edit a few months later norton rehired pohl as an assistant
popular gave pohl a very low budget so most manuscripts submitted to super science stories had already been rejected by the higher @-@ paying magazines
this made it difficult to acquire good fiction but pohl was able to acquire stories for the early issues from the futurians a group of young science fiction fans and aspiring writers
super science stories was an initial success and within a year popular increased pohl 's budget slightly allowing him to pay a bonus rate on occasion
pohl wrote many stories himself to fill the magazine and to augment his salary
he managed to obtain stories by writers who subsequently became very well known such as isaac asimov and robert heinlein
after pohl entered the army in early <year> wartime paper shortages led popular to cease publication of super science stories
the final issue of the first run was dated may of that year
in <year> the title was revived with ejler jakobsson as editor this version which included many reprinted stories lasted almost three years with the last issue dated august <year>
a canadian reprint edition of the first run included material from both super science stories and astonishing stories it was unusual in that it printed some original fiction rather than just reprints
there were also canadian and british reprint editions of the second incarnation of the magazine
the magazine was never regarded as one of the leading titles of the genre but has received qualified praise from science fiction critics and historians
science fiction historian raymond thompson describes it as one of the most interesting magazines to appear during the <num> despite the variable quality of the stories
critics brian stableford and peter nicholls comment that the magazine had a greater importance to the history of sf than the quality of its stories would suggest it was an important training ground
by the end of the <num> the field was booming and several new sf magazines were launched in <year>
frederik pohl a science fiction fan and aspiring writer visited robert erisman the editor of marvel science stories and dynamic science stories to ask for a job
erisman did not have an opening for him but told pohl that popular publications a leading pulp publisher was starting a new line of low @-@ paying magazines and might be interested in adding a science fiction title
on october <num> <year> pohl visited rogers terrill at popular and was hired immediately at the age of nineteen on a salary of ten dollars per week
pohl was given two magazines to edit super science stories and astonishing stories
super science stories was intended to carry longer pieces and astonishing focused on shorter fiction super science stories was retitled super science novels magazine in march <year> reflecting this policy but after only three issues the title was changed back to super science stories
popular was uncertain of the sales potential for the two new titles and decided to publish them under its fictioneers imprint which was used for lower @-@ paying magazines
super science stories first issue was dated march <year> it was bimonthly with astonishing stories appearing in the alternate months
in pohl 's memoirs he recalls harry steeger one of the company owners breaking down the budget for astonishing for him two hundred seventy @-@ five dollars for stories
a hundred dollars for black and white art
thirty dollars for a cover
for super science stories steeger gave him an additional <num> as it was <num> pages longer so his total budget was <num> per issue
pohl could only offer half a cent per word for fiction well below the rates offered by the leading magazines
super science stories sold well despite pohl 's limited resources popular was a major pulp publisher and had a strong distribution network which helped circulation
steeger soon increased pohl 's budget to pay bonuses for popular stories
pohl later commented that he was uncertain whether the additional funds really helped to bring in higher quality submissions although at the time he assured steeger it would improve the magazine
some of the additional money went to ray cummings a long @-@ established sf writer who came to see pohl in person to submit his work
cummings refused to sell for less than one cent a word pohl had some extra money available when cummings first visited him and though he disliked cummings work was never able to bring himself to reject cummings submissions or even to tell him that he could not really afford to pay the rate cummings was asking
pohl comments in his memoirs that for months he cummings would turn up regularly as clockwork and sell me a new story i hated them all and bought them all
by reducing the space he needed to fill with fiction pohl managed to stretch his budget
a long letter column took up several pages but required no payment and neither did running advertisements for popular 's other magazines
some authors sent inaccurate word counts with the stories they submitted and savings were made by paying them on the basis of whichever word count was less — the author 's or one done by popular 's staff
the result was a saving of forty to fifty dollars per issue
snipped elements of black and white illustrations were also reused to fill space as multiple uses of the same artwork did not require additional payments to the artist
towards the end of <year> popular doubled pohl 's salary to twenty dollars per week
in june <year> pohl visited steeger to ask for a further raise intending to resign and work as a free @-@ lance writer if he was unsuccessful
steeger was unreceptive and pohl commented later i have never been sure whether i quit or got fired
instead of replacing pohl popular assigned editor @-@ in @-@ chief alden h
norton to add the magazines to his responsibilities
the arrangement lasted for seven months after which norton asked pohl to return as his assistant
norton offered pohl thirty @-@ five dollars a week as an associate editor substantially more than the twenty dollars a week he had received as editor and pohl readily accepted
pohl was not eligible to be drafted for military service as he was married but by the end of <year> his marriage was over and he decided to enlist
as voluntary enlistment was suspended he was unable to immediately join the army but eventually was inducted on april <num> <year>
paper was difficult to obtain because of the war and popular decided to close the magazine down the final issue dated april <year> was assembled with the assistance of ejler jakobsson
in late <year> as a second boom in science fiction publishing was beginning popular decided to revive the magazine
jakobsson later recalled hearing about the revival while on vacation swimming in a lake five miles from a phone a boy on a bicycle showed on shore and shouted call your office
when he reached a phone norton told him that the magazine was being relaunched and would be given to jakobsson to edit
damon knight who was working for popular at the time also worked on the magazine as assistant editor although he was not credited
the relaunched magazine survived for almost three years but the market for pulps was weak and when knight left in <year> to edit worlds beyond jakobsson was unable to sustain support for it within popular
it ceased publication with the august <year> issue
however pohl was a member of the futurians a group of science fiction fans that included isaac asimov c
m
kornbluth richard wilson and donald wollheim the futurians were eager to become professional writers and were eager to submit stories to pohl
the futurians were prolific in pohl 's first year as an editor he bought a total of fifteen stories from them for the two magazines
pohl contributed material himself usually in collaboration with one or more of the futurians
particularly after his marriage to doris baumgardt in august <year> pohl realized that his salary covered their apartment rent with almost no money left over and began to augment his income by selling to himself as well as to other magazines
the first story pohl ever published that was not a collaboration was the dweller in the ice which appeared in the january <year> super science stories
all of the stories pohl bought from himself were published under pseudonyms though in fact pohl used pseudonyms for everything he wrote until the <num>
the first issue dated march <year> contained emergency refueling james blish 's first published story two stories by john russell fearn one under the pseudonym thornton ayre fiction by frank belknap long ross rocklynne raymond gallun harl vincent and dean o 'brien and a poem by kornbluth the song of the rocket under the pseudonym gabriel barclay
blish 's most notable contribution to the magazine was sunken universe which appeared in the may <year> issue under the pseudonym arthur merlyn
this later formed part of surface tension one of blish 's most popular stories
other writers whose first story appeared in super science stories include ray bradbury chad oliver and wilson tucker
bradbury 's first sale pendulum was bought by norton and appeared in the november <year> issue tucker 's writing career began with interstellar way station in may <year> and oliver 's the land of lost content appeared in the november <year> super science stories
asimov appeared four times in super science stories starting with robbie his first robot story under the title strange playfellow
although most stories submitted to super science stories were rejects from the better @-@ paying markets such as astounding science fiction pohl recalled in his memoirs that john w
campbell the editor of astounding would occasionally pass on a good story by a prolific author because he felt readers did not want to see the same authors in every issue
as a result pohl was able to print l
sprague de camp 's genus homo in the march <year> super science stories and robert heinlein 's let there be light and lost legacy in the may <year> and november <year> issues these were stories which in pohl 's opinion would have looked good anywhere
pohl also suggested that campbell rejected some of heinlein 's stories because they contained mild references to sex
a couple of readers did complain with one disgusted letter writer commenting if you are going to continue to print such pseudosophisticated pre @-@ prep @-@ school tripe as let there be light you should change the name of the mag to naughty future funnies
the second run of super science stories included some fiction that had first appeared in the canadian reprint edition which outlasted the u
s
original and printed eleven stories that had been acquired but not printed by the time popular shut super science stories and astonishing down in early <year>
these included the black sun rises by henry kuttner and then – the silence by ray bradbury and the bounding crown by james blish
from mid @-@ <year> a reprint feature was established
this led to some reader complaints with one correspondent pointing out that it was particularly galling to discover that blish 's sunken universe reprinted in the november <year> issue was a better story than the original material in the magazine
the magazine also reprinted stories from famous fantastic mysteries which popular had acquired from munsey publishing in <year>
some of the original stories were well @-@ received for example ray bradbury 's the impossible which appeared in the november <year> issue and was later included in bradbury 's book the martian chronicles is described by sf historian raymond thompson as a haunting
comment on man 's attempts to realize his conflicting hopes and dreams
thompson also comments positively on poul anderson 's early story terminal quest in super science stories 's final issue dated august <year> and on arthur c
clarke 's exile of the eons in the march <year> issue
john d
macdonald also contributed good material
the book reviews in super science stories were of a higher standard than elsewhere in the field and historian paul carter regards astonishing and super science stories as the place where book reviewing for the first time began to merit the term literary criticism adding that it was in those magazines that the custom began of paying attention to science fiction on the stage and screen also
the artwork was initially amateurish and although it improved over the years even the better artists such as virgil finlay and lawrence stevens continued to produce cliched depictions of half @-@ dressed women threatened by robots or aliens
h
r
van dongen later a prolific cover artist for astounding made his first science fiction art sale to super science stories for the cover of the september <year> issue
sf historian mike ashley regards super science stories as marginally better than its companion magazine astonishing adding both are a testament to what a good editor can do with a poor budget
according to sf critics brian stableford and peter nicholls the magazine had a greater importance to the history of sf than the quality of its stories would suggest it was an important training ground
norton from november <year> through may <year> seven issues
ejler jakobsson was the editor throughout the second run from january <year> to august <year>
the publisher was popular publications for both versions although the first was issued under popular 's fictioneers imprint
it was pulp @-@ sized throughout both runs
at launch the magazine had <num> pages and was priced at <num> cents the price increased to <num> cents when it went to <num> pages in march <year> and again to <num> cents for the may <year> issue which had <num> pages again
the second run was priced at <num> cents throughout and had <num> pages
the title was super science stories for both runs except for three issues from march to august <year> which were titled super science novels magazine
the volume numbering was completely regular with seven volumes of four numbers and a final volume of three numbers
it was bimonthly for the first eight issues from march <year> to may <year> and then went to a regular quarterly schedule
popular launched a canadian edition of astonishing stories in january <year> which lasted for three bimonthly issues and reprinted two issues of astonishing and one issue of super science stories
with the august <year> issue the name was changed to super science stories and the numeration was begun again at volume <num> number <num> as a result the magazine is usually listed by bibliographers as a separate publication from the canadian astonishing but in many respects it was a direct continuation
the price was <num> cents throughout it lasted for <num> regular bimonthly issues in a single volume the last issue was dated december <year>
it was published by popular publications toronto branch and the editor was listed as alden h
norton
each issue of the canadian edition corresponded to one issue of either astonishing or super science for example the first two canadian issues drew their contents from the february <year> super science stories and the june <year> astonishing respectively
this pattern continued for ten issues
the next issue dated april <year> contained several reprints from the us editions but also included two original stories that had not appeared anywhere before — these had been acquired for the us magazine and remained in inventory
a total of eleven of these original stories appeared in the canadian super science stories
later issues of the magazine also saw many reprints from famous fantastic mysteries in tacit acknowledgement of the new source of material the title was changed to super science and fantastic stories from the december <year> issue
the artwork was mostly taken from popular 's us magazines but some new art appeared probably by canadian artists
there was no other canadian presence the letters page for example contained letters from the us edition
in <year> when the second run of the us super science stories began another canadian edition appeared but this was identical in content to the us version
two british reprint editions of the second run also appeared starting in october <year>
the first was published by thorpe porter the issues which were not dated or numbered appeared in october <year> and february and june <year>
the contents were drawn from the us issues dated january <year> november <year> and january <year> respectively each was <num> pages and was priced at <num>
the second reprint edition was published by pemberton 's these were <num> pages and again were undated and were priced at <num>
the british issues are abridged versions of us issues from both the first and second series
the titles corresponded to the titles on the us magazine from which the stories were taken so all were titled super science stories except for the april <year> issue which was titled super science novels magazine

despite its name it originated not in the rocky mountains but instead in the appalachian mountains
a foundation stallion brought from the western united states to eastern kentucky around <year> began the rocky mountain type in the late <num> century
in the mid @-@ <num> century a stallion named old tobe owned by a prominent breeder was used to develop the modern type today most rocky mountain horses trace back to this stallion
in <year> the rocky mountain horse association was formed and by <year> has registered over <num> @,@ <num> horses
the breed is known for its preferred chocolate coat color and flaxen mane and tail the result of the relatively rare silver dapple gene acting on a black coat seen in much of the population
it also exhibits a four @-@ beat ambling gait known as the single @-@ foot
originally developed as a multi @-@ purpose riding driving and light draft horse today it is used mainly for trail riding and working cattle
<num> and <num> hands <num> and <num> inches <num> and <num> cm high
any solid color is accepted by the registry but a dark brown color called chocolate with a pale flaxen mane and tail is preferred
this coloration is the result of the relatively rare silver dapple gene acting on a black base coat
although uncommon this gene has been found in over a dozen breeds including the rocky mountain horse
minimal white markings are accepted by the registry although leg markings may not extend above the knee
the physical characteristics are somewhat variable due to the disparate breeds that created the rocky mountain horse
the rocky mountain horse is known by enthusiasts for its hardiness and ability to withstand winters in the mountains
it is also praised for its good nature and affinity for humans
rocky mountain horses have the highest risk of any breed for the genetic ocular syndrome multiple congenital ocular anomalies mcoa originally called equine anterior segment dysgenesis asd
mcoa is characterized by the abnormal development of some ocular tissues which causes compromised vision although generally of a mild form the disease is non @-@ progressive
genetic studies have shown that the disorder may be tied to the silver dapple gene as most horses diagnosed with mcoa carry the gene
the breed exhibits a natural ambling gait called the single @-@ foot which replaces the trot seen in a majority of horse breeds
both gaits are an intermediate speed between a walk and a canter or gallop ambling gaits are four @-@ beat gaits whereas the trot is a two @-@ beat gait
the extra footfalls provide additional smoothness to a rider because the horse always has at least one foot on the ground
this minimizes movement of the horse 's topline and removes the bounce of a two @-@ beat gait caused by a moment of suspension followed by the jolt of two feet hitting the ground as the horse shifts from one pair of legs to the other
the value of an intermediate speed is that the horse conserves energy
more than thirty horse breeds are gaited able to perform a four @-@ beat ambling gait and some can also trot
thus a rocky mountain horse with rider can use the single @-@ foot to cover rough ground at around <num> miles per hour <num> km h and short stretches of smooth ground at up to <num> miles per hour <num> km h
the faster speed is known as the rack
in comparison the average medium trot speed is <num> to <num> miles per hour <num>
<num> to <num>
<num> km h
american saddlebreds tennessee walking horses and missouri fox trotters also originated in the same general geographic area from the same mixing of spanish and english blood
rocky mountain horses have a similar history to the kentucky mountain saddle horse and together are sometimes called mountain pleasure horses
the rocky mountain horse originated in eastern kentucky from a foundation stallion brought to the appalachian mountains from the rocky mountains around <year>
brought to the area as a colt oral histories state that the rocky mountain horse as he was known possessed the preferred chocolate color and flaxen mane and tail found in the breed today as well as the single @-@ foot gait
he was used to breed local saddle mares and due to the small area in which he was bred a local strain of horse originated
this foundation stallion produced a descendent named old tobe who became the more modern father of the rocky mountain horse breed
old tobe was owned by a resident of spout springs kentucky named sam tuttle
for most of the <num> century tuttle was a prominent breeder of rocky mountain horses and helped to keep the strain alive during the great depression and world war ii
after world war ii despite declining horse populations in the us tuttle kept his herd and continued to use old tobe as a breeding stallion
tuttle held the natural bridge state park concession for horseback riding and used old tobe for trail rides in the park and for siring additional trail horses the latter until the stallion was <num> years old
old tobe died at the age of <num>
the presence of the single @-@ foot gait makes it possible that the breed is in part descended from the narragansett pacer a breed known for passing its gaited ability on to other american breeds
in <year> the rocky mountain horse association was created to increase population numbers and promote the breed there were only <num> horses in the first batch of registrations

they enjoyed a successful season but fell short of winning any competitions prompting director of cricket brian rose to say we 've had enough of being cricket 's nearly men
consistent performances in the county championship helped somerset remain challengers for the competition until the last few weeks of the season but the batting @-@ friendly pitch at their home ground the county ground taunton meant that the county finished with too many draws to claim their first championship title
consistency was also key for somerset 's success in one @-@ day cricket where they remained unbeaten in the group stage of the friends provident trophy but were eliminated in the first knock @-@ out round and finished runners @-@ up by one point in the natwest pro40

he speculated that the team 's best chance of success would come in the one @-@ day competitions
the daily telegraph provided a more positive outlook claiming that the county had enough depth in batting and seam bowling to challenge for the county championship again
they identified spin bowling as an area of weakness following the departure of blackwell
bob willis writing in the guardian shared this view and predicted that somerset would also be hindered by the difficulty of getting <num> wickets at home resulting in too many draws

sussex 's total of <num> <num> declared was the fifteenth highest total in the history of the county championship while murray goodwin 's innings of <num> not out in that match was the sixth highest score by a batsman in the history of the competition
in total six of somerset 's eight home matches contained scores of <num> or over in a single innings
in contrast <num> was reached in only one of their away matches by hampshire at the rose bowl
the home conditions helped three of somerset 's batsmen pass <num> @,@ <num> first @-@ class runs in the season including craig kieswetter and arul suppiah who were both awarded their county caps after passing the landmark
trescothick 's <num> @,@ <num> runs were the most by any batsman in the <year> competition finishing over <num> runs ahead of the next most prolific batsman and he was named as both pca player of the year and the pca 's most valuable player of the year for <year>
he was also selected as part of the team of the year along with wicket @-@ keeper kieswetter
in contrast to the strong batting line @-@ up foot suggested that somerset lacked a seam bowler to compensate for andrew caddick 's withdrawal
caddick — who made his first @-@ class debut for somerset in <year> — only played five matches in <year> and announced his intention to retire at the end of the season
he took ten wickets in <year> and finished his career as somerset 's sixth highest wicket @-@ taker of all @-@ time
this placed the majority of the wicket @-@ taking burden upon charl willoughby the south african fast @-@ medium pace bowler
he responded well and took <num> wickets in the county championship more than any other bowler in the first division
he was aided by seam bowlers david stiff who returned to the first @-@ class game for the first time since <year> and alfonso thomas

somerset lacked an effective spin bowler in <year> following the departure of ian blackwell the previous season and the spinners combined only claimed <num> wickets bowling less balls between them than willoughby alone

after durham scored <num> in their first innings somerset collapsed to <num> all out in reply only langer passed <num> runs while six of his batting colleagues made ducks
after being forced to follow @-@ on trescothick langer and kieswetter all scored centuries to secure a draw
somerset 's third match resulted in their only loss of the county championship season coming against nottinghamshire at trent bridge and at the end of may they were second bottom in the first division
their next match finished in a draw against lancashire a result which was always likely after the first day was lost to rain
somerset next picked up victories against yorkshire and sussex before scoring the second @-@ highest ever fourth innings winning total in the county championship to beat yorkshire at taunton
these three wins propelled somerset to third in the competition at the start of july and they did not drop below this position for the remainder of the season
in each of their following two matches at home against hampshire and away to worcestershire somerset batted first and then enforced the follow @-@ on after bowling their opponents out cheaply
in each their opponents managed to avoid defeat and both matches resulted in draws
during the worcestershire match langer 's first innings <num> took him past sir donald bradman 's total of <num> @,@ <num> first @-@ class runs to become the highest @-@ scoring australian batsman
successive draws against nottinghamshire warwickshire sussex and hampshire meant that somerset travelled to durham requiring a victory to maintain any realistic hopes of claiming the county championship title
no play was possible on the third and fourth days and the match resulted in another draw leaving somerset with only a slim mathematical chance of the title
another draw against lancashire while durham beat nottinghamshire meant that durham clinched the title

they won by eight wickets against warwickshire and middlesex and by more than a hundred runs against kent and scotland
their match against middlesex at lord 's was marred by some controversy after somerset were allowed too many powerplay overs in the rain @-@ affected fixture
somerset were set a reduced target of <num> off <num> overs of which <num> were allocated by the umpires as being powerplay overs three more than there should have been
the england and wales cricket board ecb rejected middlesex 's request to replay the match stating that they were upholding the precedent that umpire errors cannot form the basis to declare a match null and void
the two matches played against middlesex were in stark contrast in the match played at the recreation ground bath somerset bowled the london side out for <num> the joint second @-@ lowest total made against somerset in a list a match while the <num> <num> which middlesex made at lord 's was the fourth @-@ highest total scored against somerset in the format

he claimed three wickets in two overs to help somerset win by one run and finished the competition as somerset 's joint second @-@ highest wicket @-@ taker with <num> wickets
despite a number of good performances by somerset 's bowlers a batsman was named man of the match in each of the team 's victories james hildreth craig kieswetter and marcus trescothick were all awarded the accolade once while zander de bruyn picked up the award on three occasions
somerset completed the group stage with six wins three losses and one no result placing them third in the midlands wales west division
they qualified for the knockout @-@ stage as they were the best third @-@ placed team in the three groups

bad weather meant that no play was possible on either the tuesday or wednesday as a result of which the teams requested special dispensation from the ecb for an additional reserve day on the thursday which was granted
the wet weather continued forcing the teams to play a bowl @-@ out
each team had to select five bowlers each of whom had two deliveries at a set of unguarded stumps
somerset won the bowl @-@ out <num> – <num> with ben phillips peter trego and willoughby each hitting the stumps once and thomas hitting them twice
in the second semi @-@ final of <year> finals day somerset won the toss and elected to field against kent
economical bowling from thomas and willoughby as well as the early wickets of joe denly and martin van jaarsveld helped to limit kent to <num> <num>
on a slow pitch trescothick played what espncricinfo 's andrew mcglashan described as a brutal innings scoring <num> runs off <num> balls
he shared an opening partnership of <num> with captain langer and by the time of trescothick 's dismissal after <num>
<num> overs somerset required <num> runs off <num> balls
hildreth and de bruyn took <num> overs to add another <num> runs and after hildreth was bowled for <num> kieswetter added two runs to grant somerset victory with seven balls remaining

a strong batting display by sussex highlighted by dwayne smith 's <num> runs off <num> balls set somerset a target of <num> to win
in the opening overs of somerset 's reply trescothick scored powerfully making the chase look simple according to mcglashan
however after he was caught on <num> somerset lost regular wickets
a partnership of <num> between de bruyn and trego steadied somerset for a time but when the pair were dismissed in subsequent overs their team collapsed from <num> <num> to <num> all out
at the start of the competition somerset played with aggressive batting tactics opening the innings with kieswetter and trescothick for the first six matches
this opening pair only passed <num> runs together on one occasion against glamorgan and for the rest of the tournament kieswetter dropped down the batting order and langer joined trescothick at the top of the innings in a move that kieswetter said adds a bit of balance to the side by putting a bit more firepower down the end and experience up top

two further victories ensured that somerset entered their final match of the season with a chance to win the title
somerset had performed well but missed out narrowly in both the other one @-@ day competitions in <year> and could have clinched the competition with victory in their final match
news filtered through to the county ground during their final match against durham that leaders sussex had lost to worcestershire meaning that a win against the north @-@ eastern team would guarantee somerset the title
the result rarely looked likely a rapid opening to the chase by durham openers phil mustard and ian blackwell provided a platform for their team to claim victory and deny somerset the title
three of somerset 's bowlers claimed ten or more wickets in the competition ben phillips <num> alfonso thomas <num> charl willoughby <num> more than any other county in division one
notes team marked c won the natwest pro40

only two other players reached double @-@ figures for the county and the diamond eagles chased down the total with eight balls to spare
somerset went into their final match against the new south wales blues with a slim mathematical chance of progressing but a strong bowling display from brett lee and stuart clark restricted somerset to <num> which the australian side reached with ease
trescothick replaced him as somerset captain for the <year> season
somerset also lost andrew caddick who at the age of <num> said that he opted to retire while i was still physically and mentally strong

the highway connected highway <num> and highway <num> in lindsay with highway <num> in burleigh falls providing access to recreational cottages along the northern shore of several of the kawartha lakes as well as to multiple communities including bobcaygeon
today it is known as kawartha lakes city road <num> and peterborough county road <num>
the route was first assumed in <year> as a depression relief project and extended in <year>
it remained generally unchanged for the next <num> years before being decommissioned in <year>
however a realignment near lindsay in the late <num> changed the southern terminus of the route from the centre of the town to southeast of it the original route through lindsay became highway 36b and is now known as kawartha lakes road <num>
within the city of kawartha lakes the road is now known as kawartha lakes road <num> while within the county of peterborough it is known as peterborough county road <num>
the route begins east of lindsay at an intersection with highway <num> and progresses north crossing a former railway now the kawartha rail trail before intersecting kawartha lakes road <num>
the western leg of road <num> which travels to downtown lindsay was the original route of highway <num> and later became highway 36b
continuing north highway <num> jogs north and east serving cottages and communities lining the southern shore of sturgeon lake but remains inland by over a kilometre <num>
<num> mi itself
at dunsford which is bypassed the highway intersects kawartha lakes roads <num> and <num> — the former travels south to omemee and the latter provides an alternative route to bobcaygeon
former highway <num> continues alternating directions between east and north twice before entering the village of bobcaygeon
within bobcaygeon highway <num> crosses the trent – severn waterway and intersects the eastern end of kawartha lakes road <num>
at this point it is following the southernmost section of the bobcaygeon colonization road
at the intersection with main street in the northern end of the village the route turns northeast while former highway <num> continues north
exiting bobcaygeon the former highway serves cottages along the northern shore of pigeon lake and little bald lake
after passing nogies creek the highway descends a hill and encounters the canadian shield for the first time
the road runs along the border of the precambrian shield and the ordovician limestone plateau en route to burleigh falls
the shield lies to the north and is overlain by the plateau to the south
the highway turns south at flynns corner intersecting former highway <num>
it enters the town of buckhorn from the north then drivers must turn to remain on the route which exits the town to the east
between buckhorn and burleigh falls the highway serves the cottages that line the northern shore of lower buckhorn lake
the highway initially connected downtown lindsay with bobcaygeon
this section was fully paved by the end of <year>
on august <num> <year> the dho extended the highway east to highway <num> at burleigh falls
highway <num> remained essentially unchanged between <year> and <year> with the exception of a being rerouted east of lindsay in <year>
however on january <num> <year> the entirety of highway <num> was downloaded to victoria county and peterborough county both of which redesignated it as county road <num>
victoria county became the city of kawartha lakes in <year> and that section of the route is now known as city road <num>

along the route the road heads through the national park as well as kaibab national forest and is surrounded by evergreen trees
the section inside the national park is maintained by the national park service nps whereas the section north of the entrance completely within kaibab national forest is owned by the arizona department of transportation adot
the road was built in the late <num> and improved through the <num>
in <year> the road received its number and was given its designation as the parkway in the <num>
the parkway has received designations as a national forest scenic byway as well as a national scenic byway
adot does not officially own this section of road but it is signed as sr <num>
the road heads north as the kaibab plateau – north rim parkway through the small town of north rim surrounded by evergreen trees
the parkway enters a small clearing before meeting the park entrance where ownership by adot begins
heading into kaibab national forest on a northward path the roadway is surrounded by a narrow meadow bordered by evergreen trees
as it passes the nearby deer lake sr <num> meets an unpaved national forest road
the landscape around the route is crisscrossed by these routes as sr <num> makes several turns turning back toward the north
the highway with the new name of grand canyon highway in addition to its other designation makes several turns as it heads north through the woods
it takes a more northwesterly path as it runs through coconino county
near its terminus the road turns back northeast toward its terminus at us 89a in jacob lake
the northern segment of the highway is maintained by adot who is responsible for maintaining sr <num> like all other highways around the state
as part of this job adot periodically surveys traffic along its routes
these surveys are most often presented in the form of average annual daily traffic which is the number of vehicles who use the route on any average day during the year
in <year> adot calculated that around <num> @,@ <num> vehicles used the route daily at its northern terminus in jacob lake
the federal highway administration fhwa lists the highway as a national scenic byway and the national forest service has also designated it a national forest service byway
no part of the highway has been listed in the national highway system a system of roads in the united states important to the nation 's economy defense and mobility
due to the closure of park facilities on the north rim of the grand canyon during winter winter maintenance is not undertaken after december 1st with the result that sr <num> is usually closed to vehicular traffic from december 1st until spring
by <year> the road had been improved to a gravel road and by <year> it had been paved
in <year> the road was designated as a state highway and signed as sr <num>
in <year> the highway received the designation of kaibab plateau – north rim parkway as an arizona state scenic byway
the designation included sr <num> in its entirety as well as extending south into grand canyon national park
two years later adot obtained the right @-@ of @-@ way for improvement of the highway from its northern terminus approximately <num> miles <num> km south
in <year> an additional right @-@ of @-@ way was acquired by adot from its southern terminus approximately <num> miles <num>
<num> km north
by june of that year the parkway received the designation of a national forest scenic byway and in june <year> the kaibab plateau – north rim parkway received another designation this time as a national scenic byway

after matilda was widowed in <num> she returned to her father who married her to geoffrey count of anjou
all the magnates of england and normandy were required to declare fealty to matilda as henry 's heir but after the king 's death in <num> stephen rushed to england and had himself crowned before either theobald or matilda could react
the norman barons accepted stephen as duke of normandy and theobald contented himself with his possessions in france
but matilda was less sanguine and secured the support of her maternal uncle the scottish king david i and in <num> also that of her half @-@ brother robert earl of gloucester an illegitimate son of henry i
nobles in the welsh marches revolted against stephen in <num> but the revolt was not settled until <num>
in <num> matilda invaded southern england with her half @-@ brother 's support and the period of civil war began
josce was the youngest son of geoffrey de dinan and radegonde orieldis and had two older brothers oliver of dinan and alan of becherel
josce 's family was from brittany and he was described by the historian marjorie chibnall as an obscure breton adventurer
josce moved from devon in southern england to the welsh marches the border between england and wales because the lords of monmouth were also of breton extraction
while in the marches he joined king stephen 's household
sybil had held ludlow castle against stephen in <num> but surrendered after a siege
ludlow was an important strategic stronghold for control of the welsh borders and stephen decided to marry pain 's widow to someone he felt was trustworthy
upon his marriage josce also acquired control of the castle built in the late <num> century
josce probably also received many of the de lacy family 's holdings in southern shropshire but he rebelled against stephen and fortified ludlow against the king
josce 's position was so strong that when stephen granted much of the surrounding lands to robert de beaumont earl of leicester ludlow was specifically exempted
stephen told robert that he would have a royal grant of the castle if he could secure josce 's submission as a vassal
custody of ludlow was contested not only by stephen but also by gilbert de lacy whose efforts to wrest the castle from josce are the background to the medieval romance fouke le fitz waryn the extant prose version dates from the <num> century but it was originally a <num> @-@ century poem now lost
gilbert claimed the castle through his familial link with sybil fitzjohn 's widow who was a member of the de lacy family
others trying to take ludlow were hugh de mortimer and gilbert de lacy
according to the chronicle of wigmore abbey some time after september <num> mortimer and josce became embroiled in a private war during which josce seized mortimer while the latter was travelling
josce imprisoned his captive in ludlow and demanded a ransom of <num> @,@ <num> silver marks as well as according to the chronicle mortimer 's plate his horses and his birds
presumably mortimer met the ransom as he is later known to have been a free man
while josce was absent from ludlow gilbert de lacy was able to take the castle
josce laid siege to the castle but was unsuccessful in his attempt to retake it and retreated to lambourn with his military forces
although the exact date of this event is unknown it appears to have been some time about <num> or shortly before
matilda gave josce some lands around lambourn after ludlow 's fall as compensation
later he was given land in berkshire by king henry ii became king in <num> matilda 's son as further recompense for the loss of ludlow
in <num> josce held lands in berkshire wiltshire hampshire devonshire and somerset
these holdings included the manor of lambourn worth £ <num> in income per year as well as the manor of stanton now known as stanton fitzwarren in wiltshire in addition to the lands scattered in other counties
josce 's grandson fulk fitzwarin who died in <num> is ostensibly the hero of a lost romantic poem called fouke le fitz waryn
the work survives as french prose in a loose corpus of medieval literature known as the matter of england
however it appears to confuse events of fulk fitzwarin 's lifetime with those of his grandfather 's
other errors in the work include transposing some of the welsh marcher barons of king henry i of england 's reign into nobles of william the conqueror 's time and omitting an entire generation of fitzwarins
although scholars believe fouke le fitz waryn draws on genuine tradition the difficulty in separating the fitzwarin biographies makes it a problematic source
he was survived by two daughters sibil who married hugh de pulgenet and died in <num> and hawise who married fulk fitzwarin who died in <num>
in <num> his two daughters petitioned the king regarding the ownership of the town and castle of ludlow but were turned down

together with several smaller surrounding towns it is part of the metropolitan borough of oldham of which it is the administrative centre
historically in lancashire and with little early history to speak of oldham rose to prominence in the <num> century as an international centre of textile manufacture
it was a boomtown of the industrial revolution and among the first ever industrialised towns rapidly becoming one of the most important centres of cotton and textile industries in england
at its zenith it was the most productive cotton spinning mill town in the world producing more cotton than france and germany combined
oldham 's textile industry fell into decline in the mid @-@ <num> century the town 's last mill closed in <year>
the demise of textile processing in oldham depressed the local economy
today oldham is a predominantly residential town and a centre for further education and the performing arts
it is however still distinguished architecturally by the surviving cotton mills and other buildings associated with that industry
the town has a population of <num> @,@ <num> and an area of around <num> square miles <num> km2
oldham is however known to be a derivative of aldehulme undoubtedly an old norse name
it is believed to be derived from the old english ald combined with the old norse holmi or holmr meaning promontory or outcrop possibly describing the town 's hilltop position
it has alternatively been suggested that it may mean holm or hulme of a farmer named alda
the name is understood to date from <num> during the period of the danelaw
evidence of later roman and celtic activity is confirmed by an ancient roman road and bronze age archaeological relics found at various sites within the town
placenames of celtic origin are still to be found in oldham werneth derives from a celtic personal name identical to the gaulish vernetum alder swamp and glodwick may be related to the modern welsh clawdd meaning dyke or ditch
nearby chadderton is also pre @-@ anglo @-@ saxon in origin from the old welsh cadeir itself deriving from the latin cathedra meaning chair
although anglo @-@ saxons occupied territory around the area centuries earlier oldham as a permanent named place of dwelling is believed to date from <num> when danish invaders established a settlement called aldehulme
from its founding in the <num> century until the industrial revolution oldham is believed to have been little more than a scattering of small and insignificant settlements spread across the moorland and dirt tracks that linked manchester to york
although not mentioned in the domesday book oldham does appear in legal documents from the middle ages invariably recorded as territory under the control of minor ruling families and barons
in the <num> century oldham was documented as a manor held from the crown by a family surnamed oldham whose seat was at werneth hall
oldham 's soils were too thin and poor to sustain crop growing and so for decades prior to industrialisation the area was used for grazing sheep which provided the raw material for a local woollen weaving trade
by <year> oldham had emerged as centre of the hatting industry in england
the rough felt used in the production process is the origin of the term owdham roughyed a nickname for people from oldham
it was not until the last quarter of the <num> century that oldham changed from being a cottage industry township producing woollen garments via domestic manual labour to a sprawling industrial metropolis of textile factories
the climate geology and topography of oldham were unrelenting constraints upon the social and economic activities of the human inhabitants
at <num> feet <num> m above sea level and with no major river or visible natural resources oldham had poor geographic attributes compared with other settlements for investors and their engineers
as a result oldham played no part in the initial period of the industrial revolution although it did later become seen as obvious territory to industrialise because of its convenient position between the labour forces of manchester and southwest yorkshire
cotton spinning and milling were introduced to oldham when its first mill lees hall was built by william clegg in about <year> the beginning of a spiralling process of urbanisation and socioeconomic transformation
within a year <num> other mills had been constructed and by <year> there were <num> – not a large number in comparison with other local settlements
oldham 's small local population was greatly increased by the mass migration of workers from outlying villages resulting in a population increase from just over <num> @,@ <num> in <year> to <num> @,@ <num> in <year>
the speed of this urban growth meant that oldham with little pre @-@ industrial history to speak of was effectively born as a factory town
oldham became the world 's manufacturing centre for cotton spinning in the second half of the <num> century
in <year> over <num> of oldham 's population was employed within the textile sector compared to <num> across great britain
it overtook the major urban centres of manchester and bolton as the result of a mill building boom in the <num> and <num> a period during which oldham became the most productive cotton @-@ spinning town in the world

<num> million in the world in <year> with the construction of the uk 's largest textile factory oldham reached its manufacturing zenith
at its peak there were more than <num> mills operating night and day oldham 's townscape was dominated by distinctive rectangular brick @-@ built mills
oldham was hit hard by the lancashire cotton famine of <year> – <year> when supplies of raw cotton from the united states were cut off
wholly reliant upon the textile industry the cotton famine created chronic unemployment in the town
by <year> a committee had been formed and with aid from central government land was purchased with the intention of employing local cotton workers to construct alexandra park which opened on <num> august <year>
said to have over @-@ relied upon the textile sector as the importation of cheaper foreign yarns grew during the <num> century oldham 's economy declined into a depression although it was not until <year> that oldham ceased to be the largest centre of cotton spinning
in spite of efforts to increase the efficiency and competitiveness of its production the last cotton spun in the town was in <year>
the manufacture of spinning and weaving machinery in oldham belongs to the last decade of the <num> century when it became a leading centre in the field of engineering

the oldham coalfield stretched from royton in the north to bardsley in the south and in addition to oldham included the towns of middleton and chadderton to the west
the oldham coalfield was the site of over <num> collieries during its recorded history
although some contemporary sources suggest there was coal mining in oldham at a commercial scale by <year> older sources attribute the commercial expansion of coal mining with the arrival in the town of two welsh labourers john evans and william jones around <year>
foreseeing the growth in demand for coal as a source of motive and steam power they acquired colliery rights for oldham which by <year> had <num> colliers
the mines were largely to the southwest of the town around hollinwood and werneth and provided enough coal to accelerate oldham 's rapid development at the centre of the cotton boom
at its height in the mid @-@ <num> century when it was dominated by the lees and jones families oldham coal was mainly sourced from many small collieries whose lives varied from a few years to many decades although two of the four largest collieries survived to nationalisation
in <year> collieries employed more than <num> @,@ <num> men in oldham although the amount of coal in the town was somewhat overestimated however and production began to decline even before that of the local spinning industry

both sides had injury concerns before the match
liverpool had doubts over a number of players
kenny dalglish had not trained for several weeks while alan kennedy had been sidelined for six weeks with a broken wrist
real had concerns over striker laurie cunningham who had been sidelined since november
their first goalscoring chance came in the <num> minute when alan kennedy 's <num> yard shot was saved by real goalkeeper agustín rodríguez
further chances were created but neither terry mcdermott or dalglish were able to score
real started to exert more of an influence after this midfielder juanito started to cause liverpool problems with his passing
one pass found josé antonio camacho who beat liverpool defender alan hansen but put his shot wide of the liverpool goal
despite their scoring opportunity one problem real had was to get the best out of their winger cunningham
not fully fit he was tightly marked and made little impact in the match
liverpool had a chance to take the lead before half @-@ time
phil neal advanced down the right hand side of the pitch and found dalglish who passed to graeme souness who ran late through the real defence
his subsequent shot was not held by agustín rodríguez but souness was unable to get to the rebounded ball

liverpool 's defence had stopped as they thought cunningham was offside however he was not and camacho advanced towards ray clemence in the liverpool goal
clemence came off his line and ran towards the real midfielder camacho attempted to lob the ball over the keeper but his shot went over the goal
the tactical approach of the two sides were cancelling each other out
real 's slow pace interspersed with high speed bursts while liverpool preferred a more deliberate approach keeping possession and making use of their wingers
their various forms of marking also negated each other real man marked liverpool 's best players such as dalglish and souness while liverpool were content for the nearest defender to mark the man on the ball
despite the tactical battle liverpool were able to score in the 81st minute
a throw @-@ in from ray kennedy found alan kennedy whose run up the left hand side of the pitch caught real off @-@ guard
kennedy went past real defender rafael garcía cortés into the real box his subsequent shot beat the real goalkeeper to give liverpool the lead

founded on <num> september <year> by an indenture of robert carre the school was funded by rents from farmland and run by a group of trustees
the indenture restricted the endowment to £ <num> without accounting for inflation causing the school to decline during the <num> century and effectively close in <year>
revived by a decree from the court of chancery in <year> new buildings were constructed at its present site and the school re @-@ opened in <year>
faced with competition from cheaper commercial schools and declining rolls carre 's eventually added technical and artistic instruction to its classical curriculum by affiliating with kesteven county council in <year>
following the education act <year> school fees were abolished and carre 's became voluntary aided
new buildings were completed in <year> to house the rising number of students
after plans for comprehensive education in sleaford came to nothing in the <num> and <num> carre 's converted to grant @-@ maintained status in <year>
foundation status followed and the school became an academy in <year> a multi @-@ academy trust with kesteven and sleaford high school was formed in <year>

an office for standards in education children 's services and skills ofsted inspection in <year> graded carre 's good overall with outstanding features
carre granted <num> acres of agricultural land in gedney to these men who held the land in trust as feoffees
the lands were estimated to be worth £ <num> per annum and the indenture stipulated that £ <num> of this would be paid to the school master while the remainder would be for the benefit of the town 's poor
the indenture stated that the school was to provide for the better education of the youth and children born or inhabiting with their parents within new sleaford old sleaford aswarby and holdingham
and in quarrington north rauceby south rauceby anwick kirkby la thorpe and evedon
it is not known whether there was any other school in the town prior to the foundation of carre 's although the indenture appointed anthony brown already a schoolmaster as the master it thus seems likely that carre already operated a school and his indenture codified pre @-@ existing arrangements
throughout the <num> the trustees reported problems receiving rents from the tenants in gedney
although the school received a bequest from a local gentleman robert cammock in <year> which provided an additional income of £ <num> per annum no more followed the english civil war also disrupted funding rents were not collected between <year> and <year>
these financial problems were compounded by the nature of the land itself it was agricultural and not urban thus it did not increase in value significantly in the <num> century
carre 's lagged behind other schools and its buildings fell into disrepair as the fixed endowment failed to keep up with inflation despite the gedney lands increasing in value to £ <num> by the early <num> century
in <year> the foeffees by then often called trustees spent £ <num> on improvements but by <year> the adjacent carre 's hospital agreed that part of its building be pulled down to make way for a new schoolhouse
this did not materialise and pupils were taught in the vestry at st denys church by the early <num> century
in <year> the trustees discontinued the master 's salary because there were no duties to perform at the school
in <year> they petitioned the court of chancery for a scheme which was approved in <year> providing the master with a salary of £ <num> per annum
four years later the chancery agreed to fund the rebuilding of the school at a site on northgate
with the buildings complete the school reopened on <num> august <year>
carre 's maintained roughly <num> pupils on roll throughout the <num> but by <year> this had fallen to two free scholars and two boarders

in <year> the schools enquiry commission reported a general dissatisfaction in the town towards the school finding indifferent discipline along with poor spelling an inability to decline simple latin nouns and a low @-@ level of arithmetic
according to the report the general wish in the town is for a commercial school
competition soon arose in the form of mr boyer 's academy and later e
r
dibben 's commercial school at mount pleasant sleaford
although the trustees were reorganised in <year> britain 's agriculture suffered from foreign competition in the <num> which contributed to a decline in the rolls a subsequent reduction of fees in <year> proved ineffective and only twelve boys were in attendance the following year

the numbers rose so that in <year> there were <num> pupils on roll and the committee granted a further £ <num> to pay for new accommodation and resources
the governors however applied for £ <num> @,@ <num> to build a new school entirely but the council wanted it to be coeducational which caused a lengthy stalemate
the demand for a coeducational school disappeared in <year> when sleaford and kesteven high school for girls opened as a private venture and so in <year> a new building opened at carre 's financed in part by the sale of the gedney lands while boarding accommodation followed in <year>
following the education act <year> carre 's received an allocation of £ <num> per pupil from the board of education plus local authority assistance made in return for admitting pupils from local elementary schools

by <year> the school had <num> pupils on roll and the need for new accommodation was met in the <num> and <num> by a major building programme at the northgate site completed in <year> this added dedicated classroom blocks a canteen and hall
the educational opportunities for secondary modern pupils were limited compared to those at grammar schools prompting criticism of the tripartite system
in <year> the labour government issued circular <num> <num> requesting local education authorities implement comprehensive schooling
in <year> sleaford parents voted in favour of comprehensive education but rejected the council 's proposals
a new plan which envisaged carre 's becoming a sixth form college was supported by parents in a vote <num> @,@ <num> to <num> albeit with a <num> turnout the county council approved it but allowed governors a veto
following negotiations with governors at carre 's the scheme was revised so that carre 's would be an <num> – <num> school and adsorb sleaford secondary modern 's church lane site
despite support from most staff and all three headteachers lincolnshire county council voted to return the scheme for consultation in <year>
a new system was proposed which retained all three schools and when the government ordered the council to choose a comprehensive scheme in <year> it submitted that proposal which had become popular with parents
the next year the government dismissed it on grounds that the sixth forms would be too small but the council voted against the two @-@ school system once more
although the county council began discussing the abolition of them again in <year> opposition from parents at a public consultation in <year> resulted in the plans being dropped

footage from the country music association award performance were used to comprise a music video for don 't you wanna stay directed by paul miller
the song was nominated for best country duo group performance at the <num> grammy awards but lost to barton hollow by the civil wars
according to sellers they were at jenkins house when they started composing the song
he explained we just wanted to write a love song
we had an idea of what we were targeting
we didn ’ t write it as a duet
we wrote it and andy thought about recording it
after we got the song written we played it for jason
jason aldean 's idea for it was to make it a duet
the song is the first duet that aldean has recorded
in an interview with nashville
com aldean revealed that the song was not originally presented to him as a duet
nevertheless he and producer michael knox thought the lyrics would work for two people if he could find a female artist as a duet partner
aldean considered a number of female vocalists to record the song with especially kelly clarkson and carrie underwood
however clarkson remained as his first choice
he explained we had the song pitched to us and originally it wasn ’ t a duet
the more i was listening to the thing and learning the song i realized it set itself up to be a duet if we wanted to go that route
when i called my producer about it he asked who i wanted to sing it with me and i said kelly clarkson but i didn ’ t think we ’ d be able to get her
i ’ ve always been a big fan of hers
i love her voice and i love her style
long story short we got her a copy of the song and she loved it
as soon as she started singing it became obvious it was going to be great
on november <num> <year> don 't you wanna stay was performed live for the first time by aldean with clarkson on the <num> country music association awards
the performance triggered an overwhelming demand from radio stations across the country
as a result aldean ’ s label broken bow records made the song available on play mpe
carson james the label 's senior vice president for promotion responded if there ’ s one thing i ’ ve learned in my years in the record business it is always give radio what they want
our entire promotion staff has spent all night fielding calls and returning texts about getting this song so we decided it best to release it on play mpe first thing this morning
the song was later included on the deluxe edition of clarkson 's fifth studio album stronger in <year>
it incorporates melancholic guitar riff which is accompanied by classical elements such as violin
john hill of about
com considered the song as a classic power ballad writing whether you want to call the song country pop or something in between doesn 't matter because the chorus is so catchy that it doesn 't matter if you use an electric guitar or a steel guitar
it is set in common time and has a steady tempo of <num> beats per minute
it is written in the key of g @-@ sharp minor and both aldean and clarkson 's vocals span two octaves from a ♯ <num> to g ♯ <num>
it follows the chord progression g ♯ m – e – b
bob peacock of roughstock thought that the structure of the song was interesting with its brief four @-@ line verses and don 't you wanna stay 's throughout the chorus
as the chorus of the song starts in the sound of electric and slide guitars are prominent as aldean and clarkson sing don 't you wanna hold each other tight don 't you wanna fall asleep with me tonight lyrically the song narrates the difficulties of finding and maintaining love
cristin maher of taste of country contended that the song exemplifies the desire some people have when they want to make the move from a physical relationship to an emotional relationship which is represented by the song lyrics let ’ s take it slow i don ’ t want to move too fast i don ’ t wanna just make love i wanna make love last
gibson one of the writers of the song stated that the song does not contain a lot of flowery lyrics or sentiment
he added it ’ s just straight up what somebody would say to somebody they ’ d want to be with
allison stewart of the washington post called the song great and gooey saying that it sounded like bryan adams teaming with heart in <year> for a contribution to some alternate universe footloose soundtrack
blake boldt of engine <num> gave the song a thumbs @-@ up calling the song as a dramatic affair that demonstrates how pop and country can intersect with each other and offer decent results
he concluded his review by writing don 't you wanna stay would be a suitable fit for a foreigner or whitesnake album and though nowhere near a classic it ’ s an instant entrant into the guilty pleasure category
reviewing the album for billboard gary graff described the song as being part of an array of such bittersweet emotionally ambivalent goodbye songs
bobby peacock of roughstock gave the song three @-@ and @-@ a @-@ half stars out of five and praised both aldean and clarkson 's fine voice making for an interesting combination jason 's rough slightly nasal voice against kelly 's cleaner forceful tone
in a different perspective kevin john coyne of country universe graded the production of the song as c lambasting the song for its musical element writing the sheer volume of noise that invades the track with the first chorus takes us straight into monster ballads territory
he concluded his review by emphasizing that this isn ’ t country music
it just isn ’ t

so even though she wasn 't at the show she could still be a part of the show
as big as that song is getting for us right now it was definitely a song that we thought we had to have in the show
she cut a thing for us to use and i cut a thing for her to use in her show if she wants to do that
it 's a cool way to have her be a part of the show even though she 's not going to be there every night

todd martens of los angeles times thought that the duo looked like they were on the set of hugo
as their performance neared its end aldean 's microphone suddenly went out
sarah wyland of great american country felt that aldean was professional in handling the technical problem by continuing to sing the song with clarkson

natalie finn of e gave a mixed review of the pair 's performance writing skylar handled kelly clarkson better than colton played jason aldean on don 't you wanna stay but she 's the country girl so it made sense
brian mansfield of usa today felt that the song was out of dixon 's comfort zone and a little out of laine 's range
gil kaufman of mtv remarked that the chemistry between the pair was more like cold fusion
jennifer still of digital spy said the performance isn 't anything incredible

this conflict reemerged eighteen years prior during the events of tales of destiny
the swordians found new masters to wield them against dycroft 's vengeful ruler including stahn aileron rutee katrea and leon magnus

when reala comes to terms with this and gives her blessing kyle destroys fortuna 's lens which erases all the changes wrought by her agents and returns the timeline to its original state sending everyone back to their original times and conditions
in the corrected timeline kyle now raised and trained by both stahn and rutee goes on a journey to the temple where he first met reala
while her lens is missing kyle 's strong will succeeds in bringing reala back into existence and restoring his memories of her
development began after work had finished on tales of eternia taking roughly two years to complete
during its early development the staff consisted of thirty people when in full development a team of between sixty and a hundred worked on it
it was developed under the working title tales of x
after eternia was completed the development team considered what to do next whether a new standalone game or a sequel
as destiny had a large amount of lore created for it and there were story possibilities for a next generation of characters it was decided to make a sequel to destiny
this would be the first direct sequel in the tales series
because of the state of the world as it would have evolved after the events of destiny it was decided to set the events eighteen years after them and focus on the son of destiny 's protagonist
the key themes for the story were fate and happiness
for the story the team wanted to effectively portray kyle 's journey to becoming a hero
for this they drew on themes of learning from the teacher as seen in films such as star wars and raiders of the lost ark
to create the atmosphere the team worked at balancing elements of reality and fantasy
the story and script was handled by japanese scenario company gekko
two separate scripts were created for the main story and additional elements such as skits
both scripts were quite large
character designs were created by mutsumi inomata
a key element of the designs was the variation of time periods many characters came from
to make the character sprites as close as possible to the original artwork the team took inomata 's artwork and turned them into 2d dot @-@ by @-@ dot sprite pictures
this gave the sprites roughly four times the detail of most environments
they then built the world around the sprites
the sprite details sometimes caused problems as they would appear larger than the environments when the camera zoomed in
the animated cutscenes were created by anime company production i
g
the game 's opening was the longest ever created for a tales game up to that point
while many contemporary ps2 role @-@ playing games were being developed around three @-@ dimensional characters destiny <num> used two @-@ dimensional sprites for its characters
part of the reason behind this was that the development team wanted to create the ultimate 2d rpg
as opposed to previous tales games where gameplay development was focused on the battle system the development leads requested that the gameplay should be waste @-@ free and strategic
the grade system and new skill customizing elements later staples of the series were also developed
the game 's artificial intelligence was markedly improved the combat system was made both more elaborate and more user @-@ friendly and health and magic systems were adjusted
the playstation <num> hardware enabled the expansion of mini @-@ games the improvement of the game 's graphics and the incorporation of advanced interactive elements on the world map
sakuraba primarily worked on the battle themes and arrangements of previous themes while tamura handled selected boss battle tracks and created reala 's theme
they were able to create more tracks with greater detail to them due to the expanded storage capacities of the ps2
as with previous games a licensed theme song was created by a japanese artist for the game 's opening
for destiny <num> the theme song was key to my heart from the album fairy tale by japanese singer @-@ songwriter mai kuraki
its lyrics were designed to express the world of destiny <num>
arrangements of key to my heart were featured in the soundtrack
unlike previous tales games where voice work was recorded out of order the voice work was recorded in order of the game 's events to add dramatic weight to the performances
this consequently created difficulties with scheduling and put an added strain on the actors
it was the first tales title to receive a numbered designation in japan
as with previous tales games it featured a characteristic genre name rpg to release destiny 運命を解き放つrpg unmei wo tokihanatsu rpg
to promote the game namco created a themed playstation <num> memory card
in addition a special competition was organized where the top @-@ tier prizes were copies of the script books for destiny <num> autographed by the main characters voice actors
as a pre @-@ order bonus a special limited edition dvd featuring interviews with the voice cast was created
in addition a downloadable ring tone based on the theme song and screen displays featuring the main characters was created for mobile phones of the time and released in <year>
the game was released on november <num> <year> in japan
it was celebrated with an official launch event featuring interviews with the production staff and cast
destiny <num> would be the last tales game developed by wolfteam prior to its acquisition by namco in <year> and rebranding as namco tales studio
destiny <num> was later ported to the psp
development began in <year> after the commercial success of eternia 's psp port
the port was developed by alfa system a frequent collaborator with the tales team on spin @-@ off titles
the project was directed by yoshito higuchi who had worked on destiny <num> and became the director of the gamecube port of tales of symphonia
while the earlier port of destiny made significant changes the destiny <num> port was meant to preserve and add onto the content of the original
some of the adjustments included minor tweaks to gameplay adjustments to fit the psp 's control layout and adjusting the graphics from <num> <num> to <num> <num> screen ratio
a new dungeon featuring added story elements was also created
it was released on february <num> <year>
outside japan destiny <num> was released in china and south korea by sony computer entertainment in <year> the korean version was released on march <num> and the chinese version was released on august <num>
the game was going to be part of a world tour by sony computer entertainment to promote the next generation of role @-@ playing games but the tensions between america and iraq at the time and the consequent risks of a terrorist attack caused them to cancel the trip
asked at the launch event whether an overseas version of the game was being developed producer makoto yoshizumi said he was not certain
the psp port was released in south korea by namco bandai games 's local branch on march <num> <year>
neither the original nor the port has been released in the west making it one of three mainline tales titles to remain exclusive to japan
during its debut week destiny <num> reached the top of japanese gaming sales charts according to different sources it sold between just over <num> @,@ <num> famitsu and under <num> @,@ <num> dengeki units
for the next three weeks it remained in second place on the charts behind pokémon ruby and sapphire accumulating sales of over <num> @,@ <num>
by january <year> the game had sold over <num> @,@ <num> units becoming the eighth best @-@ selling game within that period

in south korea the game reached <num> in the country 's gaming sales charts
worldwide shipments of the port as recorded by namco have reached <num> @,@ <num> units
famitsu weekly found the story enjoyable though noted that those who had played destiny would get more enjoyment out of it and praised the voice acting
they also found the gameplay and pacing enjoyable positively noting the option to auto @-@ battle
the game ranked as the <num> all @-@ time favorite game in a <year> famitsu readers poll
japanese website game impress watch found the story impressive citing its use of time travel and the continued use of destiny 's world and lore
the gameplay mini @-@ games and customization options was also generally praised with the reviewer recommending the title to players of the series
rpgfan 's woojin lee was also positive praising the gameplay despite the very high encounter rate and was pleased that an auto @-@ battle option was included
one point that received a more mixed response was the game 's music with the exception of the opening song
in a preview for ign david smith was generally positive about the game
while he disliked the art style and its low @-@ tech look compared to its hardware he found the gameplay enjoyable and the opening parts of the story fairly relatable
he ended by hoping that namco would put the effort into localizing the title
novel adaptations include a novel focusing on nanaly called tales of destiny <num> the amber wind and mutlple light novels that told segments of the story from the point of view of different characters particularly judas
an illustration book featuring inomata 's artwork for the game was released in march <year>
a five @-@ part cd drama adaptation was also developed following the events of the game
the five volumes were released between april and august <year> under the umbrella titled tales of destiny <num> drama cd
written by frontman kurt cobain the song addresses people outside of the underground music community who did not understand the band 's message
nirvana made its first music video for an early version of in bloom in <year> however the song did not appear on a commercial release until the release of the group 's second album nevermind in <year>
in bloom became the fourth and final single from the album in late <year>
it was accompanied by a new music video which parodied musical performances of <num> variety shows
the music video for in bloom won best alternative video at the mtv video music awards in <year>
bassist krist novoselic recalled that it originally sounded like a bad brains song
then kurt turned it into a pop song
cobain went home and reworked the song playing the revised version of it over the phone to novoselic
the band recorded in bloom with producer butch vig at smart studios in madison wisconsin during april <year>
the material recorded at smart studios was intended for the group 's second album for the independent record label sub pop
the song originally had a bridge section that vig removed
novoselic said that after the band recorded the song vig cut out the bridge from the <num> @-@ track master tape with a razor blade and threw it in the garbage
the songs from these sessions were placed on a demo tape that circulated amongst the music industry generating interest in the group among major record labels
after signing to dgc records nirvana began recording its second album nevermind in may <year>
in bloom was one of the first songs the band recorded during the album sessions at sound city studios in van nuys california vig thought it would be good to start recording a song previously recorded at smart studios
the arrangements for in bloom and the other songs previously recorded with vig in <year> were largely unchanged the recently hired drummer dave grohl stayed mostly with what his predecessor chad channing had recorded but added more power and precision to the recording
cobain sang progressively harder during the recording of the song which made it difficult for vig to balance the volume levels between the verses and choruses
vig recalled that he had to change the input level on the fly and hoped that cobain would not change the phrasing or do something different while recording
cobain chose not to overdub a harmony vocal part during the smart studios sessions possibly due to time constraints
during the nevermind sessions vig had grohl sing harmonies on the song
grohl had difficulty hitting the proper notes but ultimately was able to sing what vig wanted
vig often had to trick cobain who was averse to performing multiple takes into recording additional takes for overdubs on the record
the producer convinced cobain to double @-@ track his vocals on in bloom by telling him john lennon did it
after doubling cobain 's vocals vig decided he might as well double grohl 's and had the drummer record an additional track of backing harmonies
cobain uses a mesa boogie guitar amplifier for the verses and during the chorus he switches to a fender bassman amp suggested by vig for a heavier double @-@ tracked fuzztone sound
the rhythm section of novoselic and grohl kept its parts simple grohl stated it was an unspoken rule to avoid unnecessary drum fills while novoselic said he felt his role was about serving the song
during the choruses vocalist cobain and drummer grohl harmonize while singing he 's the one who likes all our pretty songs and he likes to sing along and he likes to shoot his gun but he knows not what it means
the song 's intro reappears at the end of each chorus
cobain 's lyrics address the people outside of the underground music scene that began showing up at nirvana shows after the release of the group 's debut album bleach
nirvana biographer michael azerrad wrote but remarkably the song 's lyrics translated even better to the mass popularity the band enjoyed
regarding the song 's chorus azerrad commented the brilliant irony is that the tune is so catchy that millions of people actually do sing along to it
in his biography of cobain heavier than heaven charles r
cross asserted that the song was a thinly disguised portrait of cobain 's friend dylan carlson
the single was only released commercially in the united kingdom promotional copies were released in the united states
the <num> @-@ inch vinyl and cassette editions of the single contained a live version of polly as a b @-@ side while the <num> @-@ inch vinyl and cd versions featured a performance of sliver both songs were recorded at the same december <num> <year> concert
the single peaked at number <num> on the british singles chart
while lacking an american commercial release the song charted at number five on the billboard album rock tracks chart
nirvana biographer everett true wrote an uncharacteristically unfavorable review in melody maker accusing the single of being a cash @-@ in on nevermind 's success
whoop whoop bloody whoop he wrote forgive me if i don 't sound too thrilled
this release is stretching even my credulity beyond repair
like milking a still @-@ breathing sacred cow or what badly inferior live versions of polly and sliver on the flip don 't help matters either
in <year> rolling stone magazine ranked the song number <num> on its list of the <num> greatest songs of all time
the recording of the song featured in the video is the version recorded during the smart studios sessions
the sub pop video features the band walking around various parts of lower manhattan including the south street seaport the lower east side and wall street
while filming the video novoselic shaved his head as penance for a bad performance the band gave in new york city
this caused discontinuity in the final cut shots of the band feature the bassist with and without hair throughout the video
this video was later compiled on the nirvana box set with the lights out <year>
the audio of this version of in bloom was later released on cd2 of the <num> anniversary deluxe edition of the nevermind album in <year>
the second video created to accompany the <year> single release that was recorded at sound city studios was directed by kevin kerslake who had previously directed the band 's videos for come as you are and lithium
cobain 's original concept for the video told the story of a young girl born into a ku klux klan family who one day realizes how evil they are
his concept was too ambitious so cobain instead decided to parody musical performances by bands on early <num> variety shows such as the ed sullivan show
the humorous tone of the video was a result of cobain being so tired for the last year of people taking us so seriously
i wanted to fuck off and show them that we have a humorous side to us
kerslake filmed the video on old kinescope cameras and the band improvised its performance
the video begins with an unnamed variety show host played by doug llewelyn former host of the people 's court introducing nirvana to an in @-@ studio crowd of screaming teenagers their non @-@ stop screaming is heard throughout the duration of the song
the band members whom the host refers to as thoroughly all right and decent fellas perform dressed in beach boys @-@ style outfits cobain wears glasses that blurred his vision while novoselic cut his hair short and liked it so much he kept it that way afterwards
as the video progresses the band destroys the set and its instruments
three different edits of the kerslake video were made
cobain intended to replace the first version of the video after a period with a new take featuring the band wearing dresses instead of suits
mtv 's alternative rock show <num> minutes insisted on premiering the video but cobain felt the program would not properly convey the humor of the pop idol version
instead a new edit was produced which contained shots of the band in both suits and dresses
the original edit of the video never aired
this video won the award for best alternative video at the <year> mtv video music awards and topped the music video category in the <year> village voice pazz jop critics poll

carol park went missing on <num> july <year> and was never seen alive again by her family
in <year> her body was discovered by divers in coniston water and gordon was arrested on suspicion of murder
the charges were subsequently dropped but in <year> gordon was arrested again and found guilty of his wife 's murder
the trial judge sentenced him to life imprisonment and recommended that he should serve a minimum of <num> years before being considered for parole
he was held at garth prison leyland preston
in december <year> he lodged an appeal against his conviction which was dismissed in november <year>
on <num> january <year> he was found hanged in his cell and pronounced dead at the scene
the details of the murder are sketchy
carol was killed due to blunt trauma to her face by means of some instrument alleged in court to have been an ice axe
she was then bound with rope using complex knots weighed down with rocks and lead pipes and thrown overboard from a boat on coniston water
the body landed on an underwater ledge where it was later found by amateur divers
had it been dropped a few metres further from the shore it would have sunk to the much deeper bottom and probably never have been discovered
there was a great deal of controversy surrounding the case
gordon received much support from his family and friends and maintained his innocence
there was a large amount of local interest in the trial as shown by the sales of the local paper the north @-@ west evening mail
some claimed that much of the evidence against him could be discounted and there were vigils and petitions in attempts to free gordon from prison and clear his name
the case featured prominently in the book no smoke the shocking truth about british justice which outlined seven cases the author believed to be examples of innocent people being convicted of murder
she had talked of tracing her biological parents as she was adopted
on <num> july <year> she went missing
gordon claimed that she had left home for another man and carol had left their home in leece twice before
it was for this reason gordon claimed that he did not report her missing for six weeks
carol was said to time her periods away from home to coincide with the school holidays
gordon claimed that it wasn 't until she didn 't return in time to take up her job as a primary school teacher in september the start of the school term that he realised that there was a problem
at this time he reported her missing via his solicitor and her family was informed
on the day she vanished the family had been due to visit blackpool on a day trip
however carol said she felt unwell and wanted to remain behind in bed
she was never seen alive again by her family
gordon claimed he returned home to find carol had left the house leaving behind her wedding ring and that there was no sign of a struggle
a missing persons enquiry was launched but nothing came of it
this missing persons report was subsequently lost and it was implied by some that it was because both gordon and a senior police commander who by the time the article was published had died involved in the case were freemasons
this was refuted by sandra lean who in no smoke claimed that gordon had never been a freemason
at the time police told gordon that should a body be found he would be the main suspect
she was nicknamed the lady in the lake by detectives after the <year> detective novel by raymond chandler the lady in the lake
the body had been wrapped in a pinafore dress a canvas rucksack and plastic bags tied with several knots and weighed down with lead piping
her eyes had been covered by plasters
it was later reported that the body had landed on an underwater ledge and had it been thrown into the water a few metres farther from the land it would probably never have been found
details of carol 's death were revealed in the post mortem
there were severe injuries to the skull and it was said that her face had been smashed by multiple blows
it was later found in court that the murder weapon had been an ice axe
the body was found to be in a foetal position which suggested that the body had been dealt with within a few hours of death before rigor mortis could settle in
it has since been said that the investigators failed to acknowledge that rigor mortis passes in a <num> ‑ to <num> ‑ hour time period and that the body could feasibly have been trussed once rigor mortis had passed
many unusual knots were used to tie the body and the same knots were said to be used in gordon park 's house and boat
this was one of the key pieces of evidence used against gordon in the trial
they heard news of the discovery of the body and are said to have seen footage of the police searching their house
on <num> august they arrived home and gordon was arrested on suspicion of murder at <num>
00am the next morning
he was charged with the murder of carol park and remanded in preston prison
however after two weeks his solicitors managed to persuade the court to grant him bail
on <num> january <year> the charges against gordon were dropped due to lack of evidence
the crown prosecution service released a statement saying- after a conference with leading counsel and the police a decision was taken in agreement with all parties that there was insufficient evidence for a realistic prospect of conviction
reportedly he told another inmate that she deserved it as had discovered his wife being unfaithful
after the charges were dropped gordon said that he wished to try to put all this including the events of <num> years ago behind me and try to return to my everyday life
however the fact that the charges were dropped angered carol 's brother ivor price who said that he was disgusted by the way that carol was portrayed in the proceedings and talked of how carol was not someone who was cheap or had a string of lovers
police said at the time that the murder file had never been closed and that the arrest followed new leads
these new leads were later reported to be a confession by michael wainwright who claimed to have been a cellmate of gordon 's during his short prison stay in <year>
the police then revisited the site where the body was discovered and found a piece of westmorland green slate a stone that matched the rocks that made up the wall of the family 's bungalow
the case was brought to trial at manchester crown court and lasted ten weeks
there was no single piece of evidence that pointed to gordon indisputably but the prosecution argued that when the evidence was placed together it could only point at park and not a mysterious stranger or secret lover
primarily the case for the prosecution rested on circumstantial evidence with the jury being asked to consider knots rocks used to weight down the body and the ice axe all linking gordon park to the crime
however the statements of michael wainwright and another of gordon 's cellmates who had learning difficulties were also used as evidence by the prosecution
he was sentenced to be jailed for life and told that he must serve at least <num> years
the judge said that he had taken into account the terrible concealment of the body
park claimed he and his wife had an open marriage the court found that gordon had first put his hands around carol 's neck to strangle her but that she had struggled
he then grabbed his ice axe and brought it down with what was described as considerable force on carol 's face and smashed the front right @-@ hand side of her face splitting open her head and smashing her teeth
he then did this again – the attack was described as consisting of two big heavy crushing blows by pathologist dr
edwin tapp
after this gordon dumped his wife 's body in the lake and went back to his day @-@ to @-@ day life
during the trial the prosecution speculated that gordon had drugged his wife possibly on or around the <num> july tied her up and stored her body in a chest freezer before dumping it in coniston water
in a public statement they said the appeal is based upon fresh evidence that was not available at the original trial it is hoped the conviction will be quashed and a retrial ordered
upon his conviction mr park 's family and friends launched a campaign to clear his name claiming there was no single piece of evidence that pointed indisputably to him
representing park in the appeal was solicitor rob rode and simon bourne @-@ arton qc
they did not initially reveal what the new evidence was only that it was not available at the original trial and that it was very strong and significant
cumbria constabulary released a statement saying detectives from cumbria constabulary carried out a full and thorough investigation and the full facts of the case were presented to the cps
the case was then tried by a jury where gordon park was found guilty of the murder of carol park in <year>
in october campaigners in support of park said we have in our possession a signed witnessed statement made this week by one of the main prosecution witnesses stating ‘ police officers did put words in my mouth regarding gordon park ’ and ‘ the police told me what to say in court
’ pastor george harrison acting as a spokesperson for the campaigners also claimed that the appeals process was flawed and rendered virtually impossible due to costs
in november <year> the appeal bid was rejected by three judges at the court of appeal in london
qc simon bourne representing park had wanted to call an expert witness to challenge geological evidence used at the trial
lord justice keene said that the new evidence did not raise a reasonable doubt as to the safety of this conviction saying that the geological evidence was only a small element of the strong circumstantial case against the applicant
the new evidence presented by geologist andrew moncrief concerned the rock found with the body said to have been from the wall outside the parks house
moncrief argued that the rock was indistinguishable from others in the area and therefore meaningless
it is believed that a ligature was involved and that park inflicted the injuries upon himself
park had not been assessed for the risk of suicide
jeremy park said that we are all completely devastated and still believe his innocence <num>
since his death carol park 's family have tried to trace her ashes
park maintained his innocence and received much support from his family and friends
his children jeremy and rachael appointed a new legal team in an attempt to find grounds for appeal
jeremy also set up a website www
freegordon
com in a bid to raise awareness and support of the case for gordon
notable individuals offering support include tony benn who said that there was considerable doubt about gordon 's conviction and that he would do all he can to help campaign for his freedom
benn has been quoted as saying the case is a grave injustice
he is one of the over <num> people who have signed the gordon park is innocent petition
a year into park 's life sentence around <num> family members and friends held a vigil at strangeways prison in a bid to raise awareness of the fact that there is an innocent man in prison
another was held a year later led by jenny park and a third on the third anniversary of park 's imprisonment
it was due to these vigils claimed evangelical pastor george harrison that he was barred from visiting park once he was transferred to garth prison in lancashire
other fronts for the campaign included an offer of £ <num> @,@ <num> for anyone providing evidence that lead to gordon 's freedom
included in this were planned adverts in the north @-@ west evening mail and leaflets to <num> @,@ <num> homes in the furness area
however this was being organised by harrison with whom gordon and his third wife jennifer stayed during the trial
jeremy park wrote to the north @-@ west evening mail to confirm that he wanted nothing to do with the reward and that harrison had no right to include his name contact details or email address or mention the freegordon website in the adverts
subsequently harrison claimed to have delivered <num> @,@ <num> booklets and leaflets in the furness area
not everyone with a link to the family supported gordon 's attempts to clear his name
vanessa fisher park 's adoptive daughter appeared as a witness for the prosecution at the trial telling of how her father would hit the children with a stick or cane and how he would not discuss his wife 's disappearance
she was not in court at the time of park 's sentencing
ivor price carol 's brother has spoken publicly at various times about his feelings about gordon and the price family even sat away from park 's supporters during the trial itself
in a statement shortly after park 's guilty verdict he said he had no doubt that justice had been done and added that carol was a lovely bubbly girl who was very clever and intelligent
what has been said about her has been heartbreaking
this was about one thing justice for carol
around the same time price said that although he believed gordon at the time of carol 's disappearance upon the news of a body being found in coniston water he knew it was her and knew who had done it expressing his conviction of park 's guilt
more recently he said that he was distressed by the ongoing campaign to free park
after park 's unsuccessful appeal price 's daughters kay washford and claire gardener spoke to the north @-@ west evening mail their parents having died before the appeal was rejected
washford said it is brilliant an amazing result
our mum and dad ivor and maureen price fought hard for this justice and now they can rest in peace because justice has been done
we are so thankful for the result and so glad he will be staying in there
she added that it is finally justice for carol
the park family and cumbria constabulary did not comment
keith churchman a police officer involved in the case said that the other difficulty was of course the body was taken away from the place where it was killed
however on top of the difficulties outlined by the police the freegordon website detailed a number of what park 's supporters claim are holes in the evidence used to convict him
a story about the problems with the evidence was published in the daily mail on october <num> <year> at the request of jeremy though it was not written by him
bob woffenden the author later wrote an article for inside time in december <year> talking about the trial and its controversies
another similar article pointing out holes in the evidence was published in the sunday herald on july <num> <year>
glen banks a man with whom park had briefly shared a cell and who claimed in court that park had admitted his guilt to him was described as highly suggestible frequently changed his story and also claimed that park had admitted to killing carol while sailing to blackpool
wainwright the other informant was said to bea heavy cannabis smoker and admitted to hearing voices
he claimed that gordon had said that he went upstairs found carol in bed with another man and killed her in a fit of rage
this seemed unlikely as the parks lived in a bungalow and the supposed lover has never come forward
park also claimed to have never actually met wainwright
joan young who was the only first @-@ hand witness is challenged in both articles
she came forward in <year> claiming that she had seen someone push something over the side of a boat on coniston water
this testimony is challenged because so much time has passed and the fact that her husband saw nothing
however he claims to have been reading his paper at the time
also it has been said that young was too far away to identify the person in the boat and that it couldn 't have been carol park 's body that was being dumped as the youngs were positioned so that the location carol 's body was found would have been visibly blocked by an island
the article even points out that young described a boat that appeared to be a cruiser yacht
despite the fact that gordon did own a large yacht in <year> in <year> he owned only a <num> racing dinghy which he sold later that year
there are three witnesses who provide direct evidence supporting the idea that park was innocent
the first a neighbour claims that they saw carol at the bottom of her driveway
a second another neighbour claims that they saw an unidentified man in a volkswagen beetle in the parks drive for twenty minutes
the presence of the unidentified car has never been accounted for
around 6pm that night another witness a woman who knew carol saw her at charnock richard services
she had mentioned to her husband the fact that carol had not greeted her describing her as snobby
both articles say that the police diver had no memory of recovering it and he claimed that if he had found it he would have placed it back
professor kenneth pye a defense witness said that there was no evidence that the rock had ever been on the lake bed at all
the article in the sunday herald also claims that the policeman said to be responsible for finding the rock fainted when it was produced in court offering no explanation but still denying that he ever found it
two more issues are addressed in the sunday herald article but not in the daily mail article
the first is of the knots used to tie up carol 's body – the knots on carol 's body were mostly granny knots of which there was no evidence that gordon ever used – indeed during the trial he was specifically asked this and he responded i do not use granny knots
the granny knot is always a mistake used by someone who should have used a reef knot those learning knot @-@ tying frequently make this mistake
gordon park an experienced knot @-@ tyer would likely never use a granny knot and their frequent appearance on the body of carol is strong evidence that it was not gordon who tied them
the article also claims that the evidence of knots was irrelevant anyway as climbers and yachtsmen were so common in the area
the other piece of evidence related to another rock taken from the lakebed which had supposedly come from the parks roof
however the prosecution eventually admitted that westmoreland green slate had been worked in the area for hundreds of years and could have come from anywhere
the herald also mentions the fact that the police files from the original missing persons inquiry into carol park had gone missing themselves but does not draw any conclusions from this
both articles address the issue of who the killer could alternatively have been and both of them mention carol 's other lovers and john rapson responsible for murdering carol 's sister
both of the articles mention that he was in the barrow area around the time of the murder but both of them are careful to point out that they are not accusing him of being the murderer
this book features the stories of seven high @-@ profile convicted murderers including park luke mitchell and sion jenkins
the book claims that the expert testimonies in the lady in the lake trial were flawed that certain evidence was withheld and that the sensationalist reporting of the press at the time influenced the court by persuading them that park was the only person who could have killed his wife
park had two children by carol jeremy and rachael
gordon and carol also adopted their niece vanessa when she was <num> months old after her mother christie who was carol 's sister was murdered by her boyfriend in <year> aged <num>
this was described as a rare and appalling coincidence but has been picked up on by the case for the defence since the trial
park remarried twice after carol was murdered
his second wife was named catherine and his third to whom he remained married until his death is named jenny
park met all of his wives through teaching carol was a teacher at askam village school when she was killed
when rejecting park 's request for appeal lord justice keene mr justice beatson and mr justice macduff noted that both gordon and carol had had affairs in the year leading up to carol 's disappearance
park 's interests included sailing and climbing which was relevant to the case due to the knots used to tie his wife 's body
while in prison park spent time practising t 'ai chi taking a maths degree and keeping fit
in an exclusive written interview with the westmorland gazette nine months into his sentence park talked of how he had struggled with prison saying they other inmates may smoke incessantly play loud music the tv or video games rifle your drawers steal lie etc
there is not a lot you can do about it
i watched a guy chasing the dragon
it frightened me to death
i had never seen that before
he refused to answer detailed questions about the trial or case but protested his innocence saying if i knew who killed my wife how where why then i would have said so
i did not know then
i do not know now

there is a wide range of popular plum cakes and puddings
since the meaning of the word plum has changed over time many items referred to as plum cakes and popular in england since at least the eighteenth century have now become known as fruitcake
the english variety of plum cake also exists on the european mainland but may vary in ingredients and consistency
settlers in british colonies brought the dried fruit variety of cake with them so that for example in india it was served around the time of the christmas holiday season and in the american colonies where it became associated with elections one version came to be called election cake
plum cakes made with fresh plums came with other migrants from other traditions in which plum cake is prepared using plum as a primary ingredient
in some versions the plums may become jam @-@ like inside the cake after cooking or be prepared using plum jam
plum cake prepared with plums is also a part of ashkenazi jewish cuisine and is referred to as pflaumenkuchen or zwetschgenkuchen
other plum @-@ based cakes are found in french italian and polish cooking
since dried fruit is used as a sweetening agent and any dried fruit used to be described as plums many plum cakes and plum puddings do not contain the plum fruit now known by that name
plum pudding is a similar richer dish prepared with similar ingredients cooked by steaming the mixture rather than baking it
the term plum originally referred to prunes raisins or grapes
thus the so @-@ called plums from which english plum puddings are made were always raisins not the plump juicy fruits that the name suggests today
in old english the term plūme was from medieval latin pruna from latin prunum which equated to prune
prune in modern french means plum so plum tarts have names such as tarte aux prunes
in english prunes are dried plums and when modern cakes use them as a primary ingredient they may be referred to as a plum cake or type of plum cake
raisins and currants were used which in the english language were referred to as plums since around <year>
the various types of dried fruit grapes currants and raisins were familiar to english kitchens through trade with the levant and mediterranean but before they became available through trouble @-@ free imports from australia south africa and california preparing them required an immense amount of labour
on account of the rough and ready methods by which the fruit was picked dried packed and exported
in <year> colonel henry @-@ herbert said that a good english plum cake
is a national institution
at times thomas carlyle was one among many who ate a light style of plum cake with tea into which he would dip the cake which he described as bun @-@ like with currants dotted here and there
elizabeth david wrote that christmas mincemeat and christmas plum pudding and cake are all such typical examples of the english fondness for spiced fruit mixtures that it seems almost unnecessary to include recipes for them
plum cakes were raised by whipping air into the cake batter rather than by the use of yeast
a range of plum cakes and puddings were published in the popular book of household management published <year> @-@ <year> by isabella beeton
mrs beeton included recipes for a common plum cake and a nice plum cake as well as baked plum @-@ pudding an unrivalled plum @-@ pudding a plain christmas pudding for children plum @-@ pudding of fresh fruit plum tart christmas plum @-@ pudding a pound plum pudding and christmas cake
the comment in an indian household management book is indicative both of the reach of mrs beeton 's book as well as the range of interpretations of plum cake and plum pudding
the author says mrs beeton ’ s recipe is by far the best if modified a little <num> units of manukka raisins
up to world war i cakes including plum cakes were baked along with loaves of bread
a smaller cake or pasty might be slipped in or pulled out after the baking had begun but a raised pie with well @-@ protected sides or a large plum cake would take at least the same time as the loaves and experienced housewives made them in sizes to do so
in french cooking plums are an ingredients in a significant tradition of cake making
throughout the districts of the loire the dordogne the lot and the périgord there was hardly a celebration a wedding feast or celebration at which the dessert did not include some sort of plum or mirabelle tart made with fresh or dried plums or jam according to the season
the mirabelle plum is a specific cultivar used to make tarte aux mirabelles plum tart
a galette aux fruits is a type of galette made with yeast dough and covered with previously cooked fruit in season such as plums or quinces apples apricots
the fruit in these open tarts or flans is cut into suitably sized pieces and the cake is glazed red glaze is recommended for red plum and rhubarb flans whereas apricot glaze is recommended in yellow plum and apricot flans
the german plum cake known as zwetschkenkuchen can be found all over the country although its home is bavaria
in chef robert carrier 's recipe for it the base is made from yeast pastry rather than often used shortcrust pastry because the yeast pastry soaks up the juice form the plums without becoming soggy
in italy plum cake is known by the english name baked in an oven using dried fruit and often yoghurt
the polish version of plum cake which also uses fresh fruit is known as placek z sliwkami
this original fruitcake version of plum cake in the united states has been referred to as a reigning standard american celebration cake through the time of the civil war
during colonial times one version of plum cake was called election cake and was prepared with currants raisins molasses and spices with the addition of brandy in the recipe occurring later
election cakes were typically leavened with yeast
in new england large election cakes weighing around <num> pounds <num>
<num> kg would traditionally be served while people waited for election results
it has been stated that the first published election cake recipe appeared in <year> in american cookery
plum cake recipes in the fruitcake style appeared in early cookbooks in the southern united states and did not actually call for plums
after <year> plum cake was often referred to as fruit cake or black cake
in <year> in a description of plum cake that sounds like plum pudding it was described as mucilaginous a solid dark @-@ colored thick cake with copious amounts of plums gritty notes from raisins

the indonesian film scholars ekky imanjaya and said salim write that kedok ketawa was influenced by bram stoker 's <year> novel dracula through its hollywood adaptations

from there route <num> headed northward along doremus avenue crossing over the newark bay extension interstate <num> just north of the intersection
the route continued through the industrial district reaching higher in elevation on a bridge over the central railroad of new jersey now conrail shared assets operations csao
from there the route paralleled the turnpike 's mainline along doremus avenue
at the intersection with raymond boulevard route <num> became a divided highway once again terminating at an intersection with u
s
route <num> <num> truck in the city of newark
s
route <num> and <num> at a traffic circle near the newark metropolitan airport now newark liberty international airport
the route was then to commence along port street and doremus avenue to an intersection with state highway route 25t now u
s
route <num> and <num> truck
route 25b remained intact along the alignment of port street and doremus avenue until january <num> <year>
on that day the new jersey state highway department renumbered routes in the state and eliminated route <num> entirely
due to decommissioning of route <num> route 25b was renumbered to route <num> eliminating the relation to former route <num> or u
s
route <num> and <num>
route <num> remained on the port street and doremus avenue alignment for a short time and was completely eliminated from the state system by <year>
port street and doremus avenue are both now maintained by the city of newark but both are of the national highway system as of <year>
in <year> the bridge over the csao line was reconstructed
with his <year> opera robert le diable and its successors he gave the genre of grand opera decisive character
meyerbeer 's grand opera style was achieved by his merging of german orchestra style with italian vocal tradition
these were employed in the context of sensational and melodramatic libretti created by eugène scribe and were enhanced by the up @-@ to @-@ date theatre technology of the paris opéra
they set a standard which helped to maintain paris as the opera capital of the nineteenth century
born to a very wealthy berlin family meyerbeer began his musical career as a pianist but soon decided to devote himself to opera spending several years in italy studying and composing
his <year> opera il crociato in egitto was the first to bring him europe @-@ wide reputation but it was robert le diable <year> which raised his status to great celebrity
his public career lasting from then until his death during which he remained a dominating figure in the world of opera was summarized by his contemporary hector berlioz who claimed that he has not only the luck to be talented but the talent to be lucky
he was at his peak with his operas les huguenots <year> and le prophète <year> his last opera l 'africaine was performed posthumously
his operas made him the most frequently performed composer at the world 's leading opera houses in the nineteenth century
at the same time as his successes in paris meyerbeer as a prussian court kapellmeister director of music from <year> and from <year> as prussian general music director was also influential in opera in berlin and throughout germany
he was an early supporter of richard wagner enabling the first production of the latter 's opera rienzi
he was commissioned to write the patriotic opera ein feldlager in schlesien to celebrate the reopening of the berlin royal opera house in <year> and wrote music for certain prussian state occasions
apart from around <num> songs meyerbeer wrote little except for the stage
the critical assaults of wagner and his supporters especially after his death led to a decline in the popularity of his works his operas were suppressed by the nazi regime in germany and were neglected by opera houses through most of the twentieth century
meyerbeer 's works are only infrequently performed today
his father was the enormously wealthy financier judah herz beer <year> – <year> and his mother amalia malka wulff <year> – <year> to whom he was particularly devoted also came from the moneyed elite
their other children included the astronomer wilhelm beer and the poet michael beer
he was to adopt the surname meyerbeer on the death of his grandfather liebmann meyer wulff <year> and the first name giacomo during his period of study in italy around <year>
judah beer was a leader of the berlin jewish community and maintained a private synagogue in his house which leaned towards reformist views
jacob beer wrote an early cantata for performance at this synagogue
both judah herz beer and his wife were close to the prussian court when amalia was awarded in <year> the order of louise she was given by royal dispensation not the traditional cross but a portrait bust of the queen
the beer children were provided with a fine education their tutors included two of the leaders of the enlightened jewish intelligentsia the author aaron halle @-@ wolfssohn and edmund kley later a reform movement rabbi in hamburg to whom they remained attached into their maturity
the brothers alexander von humboldt the renowned naturalist geographer and explorer and the philosopher linguist and diplomat wilhelm von humboldt were close friends of the family circle
beer 's first keyboard instructor was franz lauska a pupil of johann georg albrechtsberger and a favoured teacher at the berlin court
beer also became one of muzio clementi 's pupils while clementi was in berlin
the boy made his public debut in <year> playing mozart 's d minor piano concerto in berlin
the allgemeine musikalische zeitung reported the amazing keyboard playing of young bär a jewish lad of <num> who carried off the difficult passages and other solo parts with aplomb and has fine powers of rendition even more rarely found in one of his age made the concert even more interesting
beer as he still named himself studied with antonio salieri and the german master and friend of goethe carl friedrich zelter
louis spohr organised a concert for beer at berlin in <year> and continued his acquaintance with the lad later in vienna and rome
a portrait of jacob commissioned by the family at this time shows him confidently facing the viewer his hair romantically dishevelled … his left hand rests on the keyboard and his right hand grasps a musical manuscript … plac ing its subject in the tradition of the young mozart
beer 's first stage work the ballet der fischer und das milchmädchen the fisherman and the milkmaid was produced in march <year> at the court opera in berlin
his formal training with the abbé vogler at darmstadt between <year> and <year> was however of crucial importance and at around this time he begins to sign himself meyer beer
here with his fellow students who included carl maria von weber he learnt not only the craft of composition but also the business of music organising concerts and dealing with publishers
forming a close friendship with weber and other pupils meyerbeer established the harmonischer verein musical union whose members undertook to support each other with favourable press criticism and networking
on <num> february <year> beer received the first of the string of honours he was to accumulate throughout his life when he was appointed court composer by grand duke ludwig of hesse @-@ darmstadt
throughout his early career although determined to become a musician beer found it difficult to decide between playing and composition
certainly other professionals in the decade <year> – <year> including moscheles considered him amongst the greatest virtuosi of his period
he wrote during this period numerous piano pieces including a concerto and set of variations for piano and orchestra but these have been lost
to this period also belongs a clarinet quintet written for the virtuoso heinrich baermann <year> – <year> who remained a close friend of the composer
in the same year his opera die beiden kalifen the two caliphs a version of wirth und gast was a disastrous failure in vienna
realizing that a full understanding of italian opera was essential for his musical development he went to study in italy enabled by the financial support of his family
he arrived in italy at the beginning of <year> after visits to paris and london where he heard cramer play
in paris he wrote to a friend i go from museum to museum library to library theatre to theatre with the restlessness of the wandering jew
during his years in italy meyerbeer became acquainted with and impressed by the works of his contemporary gioachino rossini who by <year> at the age of <num> was already director of both major opera houses in naples and in the same year premiered his operas the barber of seville and otello
meyerbeer wrote a series of italian operas on rossinian models including romilda e costanza padua <year> semiramide riconosciuta turin <year> emma di resburgo venice <year> margherita d 'anjou milan <year> and l 'esule di granata milan <year>
all but the last two of these had libretti by gaetano rossi whom meyerbeer continued to support until the latter 's death in <year> although not commissioning any further libretti from him after il crociato in egitto <year>
during a visit to sicily in <year> meyerbeer noted down a number of folksongs and these in fact constitute the earliest collection of folk music of the region
in a birthday greeting from rossi 's wife in <year> occurs the earliest use discovered of meyerbeer 's adopted forename giacomo
this breakthrough in paris was exactly what meyerbeer had been aiming for over the past ten years he had been carefully preparing for it developing contacts and fully reaped his reward
in <year> shortly after the death of his father meyerbeer married his cousin minna mosson <year> – <year>
the marriage which may have been dynastic in its origins proved to be stable and devoted the couple were to have five children of whom the three youngest all daughters survived to adulthood
in the same year following the death of carl maria von weber weber 's widow asked meyerbeer to complete her husband 's unfinished comic opera die drei pintos
this was to cause him much trouble over future years as he found the material insufficient to work on
eventually in <year> he settled the matter with weber 's heirs by handing them weber 's drafts and a cash compensation
the opera was later completed by gustav mahler
with his next opera meyerbeer became virtually a superstar
robert le diable with libretto by eugène scribe and germain delavigne produced in paris in <year> was one of the earliest grand operas
the libretto originally planned in <year> as a three @-@ act opéra comique for the opéra @-@ comique theatre was refashioned after <year> in a five @-@ act form to meet the requirements of the paris opéra
its revised characterisation as a grand opera placed it in succession to auber 's la muette de portici <year> and rossini 's guillaume tell <year> in this new genre
the composer undertook further work on the opera in early <year> adding ballet episodes including the ballet of nuns which was to prove one of the opera 's great sensations becoming an early example of the ballet blanc genre
he also rewrote the two major male roles of bertrand and robert to suit the talents of nicolas levasseur and adolphe nourrit respectively
at the invitation of nourrit cornélie falcon made her debut at the age of <num> at the opéra in the role of alice on <num> july <year> and she made a vivid impression on the public which included on that night auber berlioz halévy maria malibran giulia grisi honoré daumier alexandre dumas and victor hugo
on hearing her in the role meyerbeer himself declared his opera at last complete
the success of the opera led to meyerbeer himself becoming a celebrity
in january <year> he was awarded membership of the légion d 'honneur
this success – coupled with meyerbeer 's known family wealth – inevitably also precipitated envy amongst his peers
berlioz – who had commented that meyerbeer not only had the luck to be talented he had the talent to be lucky – wrote i can 't forget that meyerbeer was only able to persuade the opéra to put on robert le diable
by paying the administration sixty thousand francs of his own money and chopin lamented meyerbeer had to work for three years and pay his own expenses for his stay in paris before robert le diable could be staged
three years that 's a lot – it 's too much
king frederick william iii of prussia who attended the second performance of robert le diable swiftly invited him to compose a german opera and meyerbeer was invited to stage robert in berlin
within a few years the opera had been staged with success all over europe and also in the usa
the fusion of dramatic music melodramatic plot and sumptuous staging in robert le diable proved a sure @-@ fire formula as did the partnership with scribe which meyerbeer would go on to repeat in les huguenots le prophète and l 'africaine
all of these operas held the international stage throughout the <num> century as did the more pastoral dinorah <year> making meyerbeer the most frequently performed composer at leading opera houses in the nineteenth century
his artistic triumph and legendary status were achieved in paris
but he never abandoned prussia especially his home city of berlin
his wife minna was based in berlin she did not enjoy paris as was his beloved mother and he had a series of royal duties from the prussian court stemming from his appointment as court kapellmeister in <year>
for these reasons his life from <year> onwards is characterised by travel between these two centres
in paris meyerbeer had been asked by louis véron the director of the opéra for a new work
at first he attempted to persuade véron to accept the opéra @-@ comique le portefaix to a libretto by scribe which he had been contracted to compose in early <year> but véron insisted on a full five @-@ act piece
together with scribe meyerbeer reviewed many subjects before deciding in <year> on les huguenots
the contract which meyerbeer signed with véron contained a penalty clause if the work was not delivered by the end of <year>
when the time came and the opera was not ready véron claimed his <num> @,@ <num> francs under this clause meyerbeer was perhaps unique amongst composers in being able to pay this
in fact véron refunded the money under a further agreement when the opera was delivered in late <year> but veron himself was replaced as director of the opera by henri duponchel before les huguenots was premiered on <num> february <year>
it was an immediate and immense success its splendid staging and effects exceeding even those of fromental halévy 's la juive which had premiered the previous year
berlioz called the score a musical encyclopaedia and the singing especially of nourrit and falcon was universally praised
les huguenots was the first opera to be performed at the opéra more than <num> @,@ <num> times the <num> performance being on <num> may <year> and continued to be produced up to <year> more than a century after its premiere
its many performances in all other of the world 's major opera houses give it a claim to being the most successful opera of the <num> century
however in berlin meyerbeer faced many problems including the enmity of the jealous gaspare spontini who since <year> had been court kapellmeister and director of the berlin hofoper
complaints were made in the berlin press about the delay of the berlin premiere of robert le diable which finally took place in june <year> and meyerbeer 's music was decried by the critic and poet ludwig rellstab
there was no sign of the german opera expected from meyerbeer
moreover reactionary censorship laws prevented production of les huguenots in berlin and indeed in many other cities of germany
nevertheless meyerbeer who as he wrote to a friend years ago
swore to myself never to respond personally to attacks on my work and never under any circumstances to cause or respond to personal polemics refused to be drawn on any of these matters
meanwhile in paris meyerbeer began to seek new libretti initially considering le prophète of scribe le cinq mars by henri saint @-@ georges and eventually settling on scribe 's vasco da gama later to become l 'africaine which he contracted to complete by <year>
however meyerbeer had envisaged that the main role in l 'africaine would be written for falcon after the catastrophic failure of her voice in <year> he turned instead to le prophète
on <num> august <year> meyerbeer whilst relaxing at boulogne in the company of moscheles met for the first time with richard wagner who was en route to paris
their ensuing relationship see below was to have major repercussions for the careers and reputations of both
at this meeting wagner read to meyerbeer from the libretto of rienzi and meyerbeer agreed to look through the score which indeed he subsequently recommended for performance at dresden
berlioz characterised stoltz as la directrice du directeur
meyerbeer insisted on pauline viardot for the role
meyerbeer lodged the score with a parisian lawyer and refused to countenance any production until his wishes were met
it was not until <year> when the opéra was willing to agree his conditions
meyerbeer was unique in his time in having the wealth and influence to impose his will as a composer in this way
in the meantime the situation in prussia was changing
following the death of frederick william iii the new regime of frederick william iv was far more liberal
spontini was dismissed and the berlin premiere of les huguenots was arranged <num> may <year>
on the instigation of alexander von humboldt meyerbeer was installed later in the year as prussian generalmusikedirektor and director of music for the royal court
meyerbeer wrote a number of works for court occasions and also provided music at the king 's request for the first staging on berlin in <year> of his brother michael 's play struensee based on the life of johann friedrich struensee which had also been proscribed under the previous regime
in <year> the berlin opera house burnt down
the creation of the new building gave a new opportunity to commission a german opera from meyerbeer
the subject of the opera ein feldlager in schlesien a silesian encampment was an episode in the life of frederick the great
as this patriotic opera needed prussian creators meyerbeer arranged that whilst the trusted scribe would write the libretto rellstab would translate it and take the credit and the royalties
this had the added advantage of winning over the formerly hostile rellstab
meyerbeer had hoped to have jenny lind for whom he had written the part sing the lead role of vielka but the opera premiered on <num> december <year> without her although she did appear in subsequent performances
the libretto was revised by charlotte birch @-@ pfeiffer to a bohemian background as vielka for a production in vienna <year>
in a further incarnation the music was later used by meyerbeer for a revamped libretto by scribe featuring peter the great and produced as an opéra comique in paris l 'étoile du nord <year>
with the continuing delays in the production of le prophète and l 'africaine meyerbeer was now becoming subject to increasing sniping in paris
in <year> meyerbeer began work on a new project with scribe and saint @-@ georges noëma but in the following year pillet was sacked from the opera and the direction was resumed by duponchel
as a consequence meyerbeer was at last able to stage le prophète with a cast to his liking including viardot as fidès and it premiered on <num> april <year>
again meyerbeer 's new opera was an outstanding success – despite the unusual feature of the lead female role being the hero 's mother rather than his lover
amongst those at the <num> performance in february <year> was richard wagner now an impoverished political exile the success of a work so fundamentally against his own operatic principles was one of the spurs to his spiteful anti @-@ jewish denunciation of meyerbeer and mendelssohn das judenthum in der musik <year>
the death of his beloved mother in <year> was also a blow
however the success of l 'étoile du nord in <year> demonstrated that he could still pack the theatres
following this he began on two new projects an opera by scribe based on the biblical story of judith and an opéra comique le pardon de ploërmel also known as dinorah the title given to the italian version performed at london to a libretto by jules barbier
the latter premiered on <num> april <year> at the opéra comique at paris the former like many previous projects remained only as sketches
the death of scribe in <year> was a further disincentive to meyerbeer to proceed with his operatic work in progress
in <year> in accordance with his original contract with scribe he paid scribe 's widow compensation for not completing judith
nevertheless meyerbeer 's last years saw the composition of a good deal of non @-@ operatic music including a coronation march for william i of prussia <year> an overture for the <year> international exhibition in london and incidental music now lost to henry blaze de bury 's play la jeunesse de goethe <year>
he composed a few settings of liturgical material including one of the 91st psalm <year> and also choral works for the synagogue at paris
meyerbeer died in paris on <num> may <year>
rossini who not having heard the news came to his apartment the next day intending to meet him was shocked and fainted
he was moved to write on the spot a choral tribute pleure pleure muse sublime
a special train bore meyerbeer 's body from the gare du nord to berlin on <num> may where he was buried in the family vault at the jewish cemetery in schönhauser allee
l 'africaine was eventually premiered after meyerbeer 's death at the salle le peletier on <num> april <year> in a performing edition undertaken by françois @-@ joseph fétis
they also gave rise to rumours that his success was due to his bribing musical critics
richard wagner see below accused him of being interested only in money not music
meyerbeer was however a deeply serious musician and a sensitive personality
he philosophically resigned himself to being a victim of his own success his extensive diaries and correspondence – which survived the turmoil of <num> @-@ century europe and have now been published in eight volumes – are an invaluable source for the history of music and theatre in the composer 's time
meyerbeer 's personal attachment to judaism was a mature personal decision – after the death of his maternal grandfather in <year> he wrote to his mother please accept from me a promise that i will always live in the religion in which he died
in his diaries he noted significant family events including birthdays not by their gregorian calendar occurrence but by their jewish calendar dates
moreover he regularly suffered from and or imagined anti @-@ jewish slights throughout his life warning his brothers frequently in his letters against richess yiddish for jew @-@ hatred
writing to heinrich heine in <year> he offered the fatalistic view i believe that richess is like love in the theatres and novels no matter how often one encounters it
it never misses its target if effectively wielded
nothing can grow back the foreskin of which we are robbed on the eighth day of life those who on the ninth day do not bleed from this operation shall continue to bleed an entire lifetime even after death
it was probably a similar fatalism that led meyerbeer never to enter public controversy with those who slighted him either professionally or personally although he occasionally displayed his grudges in his diaries for example on hearing robert schumann conduct in <year> i saw for the first time the man who as a critic has persecuted me for twelve years with a deadly enmity
in his mature operas meyerbeer selected stories which almost invariably featured as a major element of storyline a hero living within a hostile environment
robert raoul the huguenot jean the prophet and the defiant vasco da gama in l 'africaine are all outsiders
it has been suggested that meyerbeer 's choice of these topics is not accidental they reflect his own sense of living in a potentially inimical society
meyerbeer 's relationship with heine displays the awkwardness and prickliness of the social personae of both parties
meyerbeer apart from any of his personal feelings needed heine onside as an influential personality and writer on music
he genuinely admired heine 's verse and made a number of settings from it
heine living in paris from <year> always equivocal about his loyalties between judaism and christianity and always short of money asked meyerbeer to intervene with heine 's own family for financial support and frequently took loans and money from meyerbeer himself
he was not above threatening meyerbeer with blackmail by writing satirical pieces about him and indeed meyerbeer paid heine 's widow to suppress such writings
and yet at heine 's death in <year> meyerbeer wrote in his diary peace be to his ashes
i forgive him from my heart for his ingratitude and many wickednesses against me
in the words of john h
roberts he had a rich fund of appealing if somewhat short @-@ breathed melody commanded an increasingly rich harmonic vocabulary and was a master of brilliant and novel orchestral effect
but he had very limited skill in thematic development and even less in contrapuntal combination
all of his significant music is for the voice opera and songs and this reflects his detailed grounding in italian opera
throughout his career he wrote his operas with specific singers in mind and took great care to temper his writing to their strengths but at the same time he seemed little interested in expressing the emotions of his characters preferring to use his music to underline the larger @-@ scale machinations of the plot
in this way he was close to the ideas of his teacher vogler himself renowned for his dramatic depictions of nature and incident in keyboard music who wrote in <year> that writing beautifully is easy expression is not too difficult but only the genius of a great painter
can choose for each picture agreeable and natural colours that are particular to it
indeed his devotion to the voice often led him to ignore the dramatic cohesion of his operas typically he would write far too much music and the scores of his operas would have to be drastically cut during rehearsals
the lengthy overture to le prophète had to be cut in its entirety surviving only in a piano arrangement by charles @-@ valentin alkan
the first signs of meyerbeer breaking with the italian traditions in which he had trained are in il crociato in egitto
amongst other notable features of the opera were its lavish orchestral forces extending to two onstage military bands in the final act
the grandiosity of the work reflected the need to make an impact on the sophisticated and technologically advanced stages of london and paris for which it was extensively rewritten
meyerbeer 's contribution was revealed at this stage to be the combination of italian vocal lines german orchestration and harmony and the use of contemporary theatrical techniques ideas which he carried forward in robert and his later works
however meyerbeer 's background in the italian operatic traditions can be clearly seen as late as <year> in the mad scene in dinorah the virtuoso aria ombre légère
typical of meyerbeer 's innovative orchestration is the use in robert le diable of dark @-@ toned instruments – bassoons timpani and low brass including ophicleide – to characterise the diabolical nature of bertram and his associates
at one point the arrival of a character is announced by a combination of three solo timpani and pizzicato double @-@ basses
similar adventurousness is shown in les huguenots where the composer uses a solo bass clarinet and solo viola d 'amore to accompany arias
for le prophète meyerbeer considered using the newly invented saxophone
becker suggests that meyerbeer in all his grand operas often created a deliberately unbeautiful sound
with unusual orchestration designed to express
content rather than produce a sensuous sound and opines that this explains much of the criticism he received from german writers on music
becker writes wagner 's idea of music drama
was originally developed by way of grand opera
his ideas could never have been realised in their particular form without the pioneering development s
that meyerbeer 's operas were the first to demand
meyerbeer was always concerned to intensify the theatricality of his operas even when new ideas emerged at a relatively late stage in the music 's composition
an example of his receptiveness was the addition of the provocative ballet of the nuns in the third act of robert le diable at the suggestion of duponchel
the set for the ballet was an innovative and striking design by duponchel and pierre @-@ luc @-@ charles ciceri
duponchel had also introduced technical innovations for the staging including english traps for the sudden appearance and disappearance of the ghosts
meyerbeer was led in fact to complain that the spectacle was too much and was pushing his music into the background
in le prophète the skating ballet which created a great sensation was composed after rehearsals had begun in order to capitalise on the new craze for roller skates
the theatre was also able to use new electrical lighting effects to create a powerful sunrise and to depict the conflagration which ends the opera
meyerbeer 's large choral tableaux also made a major contribution to the overall dramatic effect the composer particularly sought opportunities to write such large @-@ scale crowd scenes and preferred libretti which offered such possibilities
crosten writes these massive developed sections are the chief glory of the meyerbeerian opera for they are not only big in volume but big in their structural design
mention should also be made of meyerbeer 's intense concern with the business of opera which indeed had formed part of his studies under vogler
this gave him the background not only to deal with complex contractual issues and to negotiate with publishers but extended to wooing the press and marketing in general
indeed he was probably the originator of the press conference at which journalists were fed refreshment and information
this marketing and commercialisation of opera was reinforced by meyerbeer 's paris publisher maurice schlesinger who had established his fortune on the back of robert and even persuaded honoré de balzac to write a novella gambara to promote les huguenots
schlesinger 's publication of franz liszt 's reminiscences de robert le diable sold out on the day of issue and was immediately reprinted
such manoeuvres did little to endear meyerbeer to his fellow artists and indeed engendered envious comments of the sort already quoted from berlioz and chopin
yet as his works spanned the golden age of grand opera clear traces of his influence can be found in the grand operas of fromental halévy gaetano donizetti giuseppe verdi and others
after <year> huebner notes a continuing tradition of operas at paris where principals appear with chorus at the end of an act and where private intrigue conjoins a well @-@ articulated public dimension in the plot and cites amongst others charles gounod 's la nonne sanglante <year> ambroise thomas 's hamlet and operas by jules massenet amongst them le roi de lahore <year> and le cid <year>
the line of succession was however virtually washed away in the tide of wagner in paris after <year> see below
the influence of meyerbeer has also been detected in the operas of antonín dvořák and other czech composers and in the operas of russian composers including rimsky @-@ korsakov and the young tchaikovsky who thought les huguenots one of the greatest works in the repertoire
themes from meyerbeer 's works were used by many contemporary composers often in the form of keyboard paraphprases or fantasies
perhaps the most elaborate and substantial of these is franz liszt 's monumental fantasy and fugue on the chorale ad nos ad salutarem undam s
<num> <year> for organ or pédalier based on the chorale of the anabaptist priests in le prophète and dedicated to meyerbeer
the work was also published in a version for piano duet s
<num> which was much later arranged for solo piano by ferrucio busoni
liszt also wrote piano works based on robert le diable notably the réminiscences de robert le diable subtitled valse infernale
he also transcribed two pieces from l 'africaine as illustrations de l 'opéra l 'africaine
frédéric chopin and auguste franchomme jointly composed a grand duo concertant on themes from the opera for cello and piano in <year> and the italian pianist and composer adolfo fumagalli composed an elaborate fantasy on the opera for left hand alone as his op
<num>
other pieces based on the opera included works by adolf von henselt and jean @-@ amédée méreaux
similar works of varying musical quality were churned out by composers for each of the further operas in attempts to cash in on their success
it looks for its salvation to the german messiah meyerbeer if he keeps it waiting much longer its death agonies will begin
it is for that reason
that one only sees robert le diable and les huguenots turning up again when the mediocrities are forced to withdraw
however dissenting voices were heard from critics
not all of these however were on musical grounds
berlioz for example raised the issue of the inhibiting effects of meyerbeer 's success which he felt particularly as one who struggled to get his works performed the pressure meyerbeer exerts on managers artists and critics and consequently on the paris public at least as much by his immense wealth as by his eclectic talent makes all serious success at the opéra virtually impossible
this baneful influence may still be felt ten years after his death heinrich heine maintains he has paid in advance
mendelssohn disapproved of meyerbeer 's works on moral grounds believing robert le diable to be ignoble
schumann 's attack on les huguenots was clearly a personal diatribe against meyerbeer 's judaism time and time again we had to turn away in disgust
one may search in vain for a sustained pure thought a truly christian sentiment
it is all contrived all make believe and hypocrisy
the shrewdest of composers rubs his hands with glee
wagner 's disciple theodor uhlig followed schumann 's judaeophobic line in his <year> review of le prophète to a good christian it is at best contrived exaggerated unnatural and slick and it is not possible that the practised propaganda of the hebrew art @-@ taste can succeed using such means
uhlig 's phrase the hebrew art @-@ taste was to be used by richard wagner to spark off his attack on meyerbeer das judenthum in der musik jewishness in music
see below
in <year> the composer charles villiers stanford cited meyerbeer 's music as an example of the dangers he believed lay in improvising at the piano without a clear plan although there is in fact no evidence to suggest meyerbeer worked in this way writing man of genius though he was as any man who wrote the fourth act of the huguenots must have been meyerbeer is a sign @-@ post of this danger of trusting to the pianoforte as a medium of inspiration
this campaign was as much a matter of personal spite as of racism – wagner had learnt a great deal from meyerbeer and indeed wagner 's early opera rienzi <year> was facetiously called by hans von bülow meyerbeer 's best opera
meyerbeer supported the young wagner both financially and in helping to obtain the premiere productions of both rienzi and the flying dutchman at dresden
wagner 's early correspondence with meyerbeer up to <year> is cringingly obsequious
however from the early <num> as wagner developed tannhäuser and lohengrin his ideas on opera increasingly diverged from meyerbeerean standards even in <year> wagner had written to schumann condemning meyerbeer 's work as a striving after superficial popularity
during <year> meyerbeer turned down wagner 's application for a loan of <num> @,@ <num> thalers and this may have marked a turning point
in particular after <year> wagner resented meyerbeer 's continuing success at a time when his own vision of german opera had little chance of prospering
after the may uprising in dresden of <year> wagner was for some years a political refugee facing a prison sentence or worse should he return to saxony
during his period of living in exile he had few sources of income and little opportunity of getting his own works performed
the success of le prophète sent wagner over the edge and he was also deeply envious of meyerbeer 's wealth
in reaction he published under a pseudonym his <year> essay jewishness in music
without specifically naming meyerbeer he interpreted the popular success of the latter as the undermining of german music by alleged jewish venality and willingness to cater to the lowest tastes and attributed the supposed poor quality of such jewish music to jewish speech and song patterns which though the cultured son of jewry takes untold pains to strip them off nevertheless they shew an impertinent obstinacy in cleaving to him
in his major theoretical statement opera and drama <year> wagner objected to the music of meyerbeer asserting its superficiality and incoherence in dramatic terms this work contains wagner 's well @-@ known put @-@ down of meyerbeer 's operas as effects without causes
it also contains the sardonic crack that rossini never could have dreamt that it would some day occur to the bankers for whom he had always made their music to make it for themselves
jewishness in music was reissued in <year> after meyerbeer 's death in an extended form with a far more explicit attack on meyerbeer
this version was under wagner 's own name – and as wagner had by now a far greater reputation his views obtained far wider publicity
these attacks on meyerbeer which also included swipes at felix mendelssohn are regarded by paul lawrence rose as a significant milestone in the growth of german anti @-@ semitism
as wagner prospered it became second @-@ nature for him his wife cosima and the wagner circle to deprecate meyerbeer and his works and cosima 's diaries contain numerous instances of this – as well as recording a dream of wagner 's in which he and meyerbeer were reconciled
wagner 's autobiography mein leben circulated amongst his friends and published openly in <year> contains constant sniping at meyerbeer and concludes with wagner exulting over meyerbeer 's death
the downgrading of meyerbeer became a commonplace amongst wagnerites in <year> george bernard shaw in the perfect wagnerite commented that nowadays young people cannot understand how anyone could have taken meyerbeer 's influence seriously
thus as wagner 's stock rose meyerbeer 's fell
in <year> the year before the paris premiere of wagner 's lohengrin there were no wagner performances at the paris opéra and <num> performances of meyerbeer 's four grand operas
in <year> there were <num> wagner performances and only three of meyerbeer les huguenots being the sole work performed
they were banned in germany from <year> and subsequently in subject countries by the nazi regime because the composer was jewish and this was a major factor in their further disappearance from the repertory
one of the first serious post @-@ war studies of meyerbeer and grand opera was crosten 's <year> book grand opera an art and a business which laid out the themes and standards for much subsequent research
a major contribution to revival of interest in meyerbeer was the work of the scholar heinz becker leading to the complete publication between <year> and <year> of meyerbeer 's complete diaries and correspondence in german which are an important source for musical history of the era
the english scholar robert letellier has translated the diaries and undertaken a wide range of meyerbeer studies
not least the establishment of a meyerbeer fan club in america has stimulated interest
most importantly the operas themselves are now beginning to be revived and recorded although despite the efforts of such champions as dame joan sutherland who took part in performances of and recorded les huguenots they have yet to achieve anything like the huge popular following they attracted during their creator 's lifetime
recordings are now available of all the operas from il crociato onwards for many of the earlier italian operas and for other pieces including his songs and the incidental music for struensee
amongst reasons often adduced for the dearth of modern productions are the scale of meyerbeer 's more ambitious works and the cost of mounting them as well as the alleged lack of virtuoso singers capable of doing justice to meyerbeer 's demanding music
however recent successful productions of some of the major operas at relatively small centres such as strasbourg l 'africaine <year> and metz les huguenots <year> show that this conventional wisdom can be challenged
a highly successful production of les huguenots conducted by marc minkowski with stage direction by gilbert py was presented at brussels théâtre de la monnaie in <year> and a new production of the same work opened at the staatstheater nürnberg in <year> conducted by guido johannes rumstadt with stage direction by tobias kratzer a co @-@ production with opéra de nice
in december <year> the royal opera house in london premiered its first performance of robert le diable in <num> years
in <year> meyerbeer 's original version of l 'africaine in a new critical edition by jürgen schläder was performed by chemnitz opera house under the original title vasco de gama
the production was a success with audiences and critics and won the poll of german critics award presented by opernwelt magazine annually as rediscovery of the year in <year>
on <num> september <year> a plaque to mark meyerbeer 's last residence was put up at pariser platz 6a berlin

the ride was closed in late <year> for refurbishment and it emerged in <year> as superman escape from krypton
the refurbished ride featured new trains which face backward and it was painted with a new color scheme

the ride was designed by intamin a swiss roller coaster firm
it was originally intended to open on june <num> <year>
however due to a range of problems with the launch system its opening was delayed
in late <year> there was a preview for season pass holders
after <num> months of testing and reengineering the ride opened on march <num> <year>
after its opening the media claimed superman to be the fastest roller coaster in the world
however since it was delayed a similar roller coaster known as tower of terror which also has a <num> @-@ mile @-@ per @-@ hour launch <num> km h had opened about a month earlier at dreamworld in australia
superman therefore lost its claim as being the first roller coaster to reach <num> miles per hour <num> km h although it was then tied with tower of terror as the fastest roller coaster in the world

vermont was then a disputed territory sometimes called the new hampshire grants claimed by new york new hampshire and the newly organized and not yet recognized but de facto independent government of vermont
on the morning of july <num> <year> british forces under general simon fraser caught up with the american rear guard of the forces retreating after the withdrawal from fort ticonderoga
it was the only battle in vermont during the revolution
the battle of bennington was fought in what is now walloomsac new york
the american retreat from fort ticonderoga began late on july <num> after british cannons were seen on top of high ground mount defiance aka rattlesnake mountain and sugar loaf hill that commanded the fort
the bulk of general arthur st
clair 's army retreated through hubbardton to castleton while the rear guard commanded by seth warner stopped at hubbardton to rest and pick up stragglers
general fraser alerted to the american withdrawal early on july <num> immediately set out in pursuit leaving a message for general john burgoyne to send reinforcements as quickly as possible
that night fraser camped a few miles short of hubbardton and the german general friedrich adolf riedesel leading reinforcements camped a few miles further back
rising early in the morning fraser reached hubbardton where he surprised some elements of the american rear while other elements managed to form defensive lines
in spirited battle the americans were driven back but had almost succeeded in turning fraser 's left flank when riedesel and his german reinforcements arrived eventually scattering the american forces
the battle took a large enough toll on the british forces that they did not further pursue the main american army
the many american prisoners were sent to ticonderoga while most of the british troops made their way to skenesboro to rejoin burgoyne 's army
most of the scattered american remnants made their way to rejoin st
clair 's army on its way toward the hudson river
on july <num> general arthur st
clair 's american forces defending fort ticonderoga and its supporting defenses discovered that burgoyne 's men had placed cannons on a position overlooking the fort
they evacuated the fort that night with the majority of the army marching down a rough road now referred to locally as the <year> hubbardton military road toward hubbardton in the disputed new hampshire grants territory
the day was hot and sunny and the pace was rapid and grueling most of the army marched <num> miles <num> km to castleton before making camp on the evening of july <num>
leaving a message for general burgoyne he set out in pursuit with companies of grenadiers <num> <num> <num> and <num> foot and light infantry <num> <num> <num> <num> and <num> as well as two companies of the <num> regiment and about <num> loyalists and indian scouts
burgoyne ordered riedesel to follow he set out with a few companies of brunswick jägers and grenadiers leaving orders for the rest of his troops to come as rapidly as possible
fraser 's advance corps was only a few miles behind colonel ebenezer francis <num> massachusetts regiment which acted as st
clair 's rear guard
american general st
clair paused at hubbardton to give the main army 's tired and hungry troops time to rest while he hoped the rear guard would arrive
when it did not arrive in time he left colonel seth warner and the green mountain boys behind along with the <num> new hampshire regiment under colonel nathan hale at hubbardton to wait for the rear while the main army marched on to castleton
when francis and hale 's men arrived warner decided against st
clair 's orders that they would spend the night there rather than marching on to castleton
warner who had experience in rear @-@ guard actions while serving in the invasion of quebec arranged the camps in a defensive position on monument hill and set patrols to guard the road to ticonderoga
baron riedesel caught up with fraser around <num> pm and insisted that his men could not go further before making camp
fraser who acquiesced to this as riedesel was senior to him in the chain of command pointed out that he was authorized to engage the enemy and would be leaving his camp at <num> am the next morning
he then advanced until he found a site about three miles <num>
<num> km from hubbardton where his troops camped for the night
riedesel waited for the bulk of his men about <num> @,@ <num> strong and also made camp
riedesel left his camp at <num> am with a picked group of men and was still behind fraser when the latter arrived at hubbardton near dawn and very nearly surprised elements of hale 's regiment which were scattered in the early fighting
a messenger had arrived from general st
clair delivering news that the british had reached skenesboro where the elements of the retreating army had planned to regroup and that a more circuitous route to the hudson river was now required
st
clair 's instructions were to follow him immediately to rutland
francis men had formed a column to march out around <num> <num> when the british vanguard began cresting the hill behind them
rapidly reforming into a line behind some cover the massachusetts men unleashed a withering volley of fire at the winded british
general fraser took stock of the situation and decided to send a detachment around to flank the american left at the risk of exposing his own left which he hoped would hold until riedesel arrived
riedesel reached the top of another hill where he observed that the american line now including parts of hale 's regiment was in fact pressing on fraser 's left
he therefore sent his grenadiers to support fraser 's flank and directed the jägers against the american center
at some point early in the conflict st
clair was made aware of the gunfire off in the distance
he immediately dispatched henry brockholst livingston and isaac dunn to send the militia camped closest to hubbardton down the road in support of the action
when they reached the area of those camps they found those militia companies in full retreat away from the gunfire in the distance and no amount of persuasion could convince the men to turn around
livingston and dunn continued riding toward hubbardton
falling back to a secure position on monument hill the americans repulsed several vigorous british assaults although colonel francis was hit in the arm by a shot
he soldiered on directing troops to a perceived weakness on fraser 's left
the tide of the battle turned when after more than an hour of battle riedesel 's grenadiers arrived
these disciplined forces entered the fray singing hymns to the accompaniment of a military band to make them appear more numerous than they actually were
the american flanks were turned and they were forced to make a desperate race across an open field to avoid being enveloped
colonel francis fell in a volley of musket fire as the troops raced away from the advancing british and scattered into the countryside
harassed by fraser 's scouts and indians and without food or shelter it took some of them five days to reach the army which was by then nearing fort edward
others including colonel hale and a detachment of <num> men were captured by the british as they mopped up the scene
colonel francis in a sign of respect from his opponents was buried with the brunswick dead
baron riedesel and the brunswickers departed for skenesboro the next day much to general fraser 's chagrin
their departure left him in the most disaffected part of america every person a spy with <num> tired men a sizable contingent of prisoners and wounded and no significant supplies
on july <num> he sent the <num> prisoners under light guard but with threats of retaliation should they try to escape toward ticonderoga while he marched his exhausted forces toward castleton and then skenesboro
livingston and dunn the two men sent toward the battle by st
clair were met by retreating americans on the castleton road after the battle was over
they returned to castleton with the bad news and the army marched off eventually reaching the american camp at fort edward on july <num>
a separate return for the german troops has <num> killed and <num> wounded for a grand total of <num> killed and <num> wounded
historian richard m
ketchum gives different british casualties of <num> killed and <num> wounded
the american casualties were <num> killed <num> wounded and <num> captured
the battlefield was added to the national register of historic places in <year> and is the site of annual revolutionary war reenactments
he lifted his city from the position of a regional center subordinate to rome into the supreme power in the east
odaenathus was born into an aristocratic palmyrene family who had received roman citizenship in the <num> under the severan dynasty
he was the son of hairan the descendant of nasor
the circumstances surrounding his rise are ambiguous he became the lord ras of the city a position created for him as early as the <num> and by <num> he was styled a consularis indicating a high status in the roman empire
the defeat and captivity of emperor valerian at the hands of the persian sassanian monarch shapur i in <num> left the eastern roman provinces largely at the mercy of the persians
odaenathus stayed on the side of rome assuming the title of king he led the palmyrene army and fell upon the persians before they could cross the euphrates to the eastern bank and inflicted upon them a considerable defeat
then odaenathus took the side of emperor gallienus the son and successor of valerian who was facing the usurpation of fulvius macrianus
the rebel declared his sons emperors leaving one in syria and taking the other with him to europe
odaenathus attacked the remaining usurper and quelled the rebellion
he was rewarded many exceptional titles by the emperor who formalized his self @-@ established position in the east
in reality the emperor could have done little but to accept the declared nominal loyalty of odaenathus
in a series of rapid and successful campaigns starting in <num> he crossed the euphrates and recovered carrhae and nisibis
he then took the offensive to the heartland of persia and arrived at the walls of its capital ctesiphon
the city withstood the short siege but odaenathus reclaimed the entirety of roman lands occupied by the persians since the beginning of their invasions in <num>
odaenathus celebrated his victories and declared himself king of kings crowning his son hairan i as co @-@ king
by <num> odaenathus was in effective control of the levant mesopotamia and anatolia 's eastern region
odaenathus observed all due formalities towards the emperor but in practice ruled as an independent monarch
in <num> the king launched a second invasion of persia but had to abandon the campaign and head north to bithynia to repel the attacks of germanic riders besieging the city of heraclea pontica
he was assassinated in <num> during or immediately after the anatolian campaign together with hairan
the identities of the perpetrator or the instigator are unknown and many stories accusations and speculations exist in ancient sources
he was succeeded by his son vaballathus under the regency of his widow zenobia who used the power established by odaenathus to forge the palmyrene empire in <num>
<num> ad
udaynath is the king 's personal name an arabic name that means little ear
septimius was the family 's gentilicium surname adopted as an expression of loyalty to the roman severan dynasty whose emperor septimius severus granted the family roman citizenship in the late second century
in the temple of bel at palmyra a stone block with a sepulchral inscription was found mentioning the building of a tomb and recording the genealogy of the builder odaenathus son of hairan son of wahb allat son of nasor
traditional scholarship believed the builder to be an ancestor of the king and he was given the designation odaenathus i
in an inscription dated to <num> the name of the ras lord of palmyra hairan son of odaenathus is written and he was thought to be the son of odaenathus i
prior to the <num> the earliest known inscription attesting king odaenathus was dated to <num> leading traditional scholarship to believe that hairan ras of palmyra is the father of the king and that odaenathus i was his grandfather
however an inscription published in <year> by archaeologist michael gawlikowski and dated to <num> mentions king odaenathus as a ras and records the same genealogy found in the sepulchral inscription confirming the name of king odaenathus grandfather as wahb allat
therefor it is certain that king odaenathus is the builder of the tomb ruling out the existence of odaenathus i
ras hairan mentioned in the <num> inscription is identical with odaenathus elder son and co @-@ ruler prince hairan i
the origin of the family is aramean while the king himself appears to be of mixed aramean and arab descent his name is arabic while the names of his ancestors father hairan and great grandfather nasor are aramaic
zosimus asserted that odaenathus descended from illustrious forebears but the position of the family in palmyra is debated it was probably part of the wealthy mercantile class
alternatively the family could have belonged to the tribal leadership who amassed a fortune as landowners and patrons of the palmyrene caravans
in dura @-@ europos a relief dated to <num> was commissioned by hairan son of maliko son of nasor this hairan might have been the head of the palmyrene trade colony in dura @-@ europos and probably belonged to the same family of odaenathus
nasor father of maliko mentioned in the dura @-@ europos inscription could therefore be odaenathus great @-@ great @-@ great grandfather
odaenathus descended from an aristocratic family albeit not a royal one as the city was ruled by a council and had no tradition of hereditary monarchy
bilingual inscriptions from palmyra record the title of the palmyrene ruler as ras in palmyrene and exarchos in greek meaning the lord of palmyra
the title was created for odaenathus and was not a usual title in the roman empire or a part of the traditional palmyrene governance institutions whether it indicated a military or a priestly position is unknown but the military role is more likely
the rise of the aggressive sasanian empire in <num> and the iranian incursions which affected palmyrene trade combined with the weakness of the roman empire were probably the reasons behind the palmyrene council 's decision to elect a lord for the city in order for him to lead a strengthened army
the ras title enabled the bearer to tackle the difficult situation that arose due to the sasanian insurgencies the supreme authority of the ras probably made him the supreme civil and military commander with authority over the entire palmyrene army which was previously decentralized and led by different generals
the earliest known inscriptions mentioning the title are dated to october <num> and april <num> the <num> inscription refer to odaenathus eldest son hairan i as ras while the <num> inscription mention odaenathus with that title
hairan i was apparently elevated to co @-@ lordship status by his father
although the written evidence for odaenathus lordship dates to <num> it is possible that he acquired the title as early as the <num> following the death of roman emperor gordian iii in <num> during a campaign against persia the palmyrenes might have elected odaenathus to defend the city
odaenathus was described as roman senator in the undated tomb inscription and hairan i was mentioned with the same title in the <num> inscription
scholarly opinions vary on the exact date of odaenathus elevation to the position gawlikowski and jean starcky maintain that the senatorial rank predates the ras elevation
udo hartmann concludes that odaenathus first became a ras in the <num> then a senator in <num>
another possibility is that the senatorial rank and lordship occurred simultaneously odaenathus was chosen as a ras following gordian 's death then after philip the arab concluded a peace with the persians the emperor ratified odaenathus lordship and admitted him to the senate to guarantee palmyra 's continuous subordination
as early as the <num> odaenathus inflated the palmyrene army recruiting the desert nomads and increasing the numbers of the palmyrene heavy cavalry units clibanarii
in <num> persian emperor shapur i started a full @-@ scale invasion of the roman provinces in the east
during the second campaign of the invasion shapur conquered antioch and headed south where his advance was checked in <num> by emesa 's priest king uranius antoninus
the events of <num> were mentioned in the works of the sixth century historian john malalas who also mentioned a leader by the name enathus inflicting a defeat upon the retreating shapur near the euphrates
enathus is probably identical with odaenathus and while malalas account indicate that odaenathus defeated the persians in <num> there is no proof that the palmyrene leader engaged shapur before <num> and malalas account seems to be confusing odaenathus future actions during <num> with the events of <num>
shapur i destroyed the palmyrene trade colonies all along the euphrates including the colonies at anah in <num> and at dura @-@ europos in <num> peter the patrician says that odaenathus approached shapur to negotiate palmyrene interests but was rebuffed and the gifts sent to the persians were thrown into the river
the date for the attempted negotiations is debated some scholars including john f
drinkwater set the event in <num> while others such as alaric watson set it in <num> following the destruction of dura @-@ europos
however the title ὁ λαμπρότατος ὑπατικός was sometimes used in syria to denote the provincial governor and william waddington proposed that odaenathus was indeed the governor of phoenice
five of the inscriptions mentioning odaenathus as consul are dated to the seleucid year <num> <num> ad during which no governor for phoenice is attested which might indicate that this was odaenathus year of governorship
in the city of tyre phoenice 's capital the lines to septimius odaenathus the most illustrious
the septimian colony of tyre were found inscribed on a marble base the inscription is not dated and if it was set after <num> then it indicates that odaenathus was appointed as the governor of the province
these speculations cannot be proven without doubt but as a governor odaenathus would have been the highest authority in the province and above any legionary commander and provincial officials this would make him the commander of the roman forces in the province
whatever the case may be starting from <num> odaenathus strengthened his position and extended his political influence in the region
by <num> odaenathus held the rank credibility and power to pacify the roman east following the battle of edessa
the persian emperor then ravaged cappadocia cilicia and claimed to have captured antioch the metropolis of syria
taking advantage of the situation fulvius macrianus the commander of the imperial treasury declared his sons quietus and macrianus minor as joint emperors in august <num> opposing valerian 's son gallienus
fulvius macrianus took antioch as his center and organized the resistance against shapur he dispatched balista his praetorian prefect to anatolia
shapur was defeated in the region of sebaste at pompeiopolis prompting the persians to evacuate cilicia while balista went back to antioch
balista 's victory was only partial as shapur withdrew east of cilicia where the marauding persian units continued to occupy the area while a persian force took advantage of balista 's return to syria and headed further west in anatolia
it is not known if odaenathus contacted fulvius macrianus and there is no evidence that he took orders from him
the palmyrene monarch fell upon the retreating shapur at a place between samosata and zeugma west of the euphrates in late summer <num>
odaenathus defeated the persians expelling shapur from the province of syria
however the sassanians kept the regions east of the euphrates
in the beginning of <num> fulvius macrianus headed to europe accompanied by macrianus minor leaving quietus and balista in emesa
odaenathus whereabouts during this episode are not clear he could have distributed the army in garrisons along the frontier or might have brought it back to his capital
the palmyrene monarch seems to have waited until the situation clear declaring loyalty neither to fulvius macrianus nor to gallienus
in the spring of <num> fulvius macrianus arrived in the balkans but was defeated and killed along with macrianus minor odaenathus then marched on emesa where quietus and balista were staying
the emesans killed quietus as odaenathus approached the city while balista was captured and executed by the king in autumn <num>
corrector totius orientis commander of the entire east it is generally accepted by modern scholars that he bore this title
the corrector had an overall command of the roman armies and authority over the roman provincial governors in the designated region
there are no known attestations of the title during odaenathus lifetime
evidences for the king bearing the title are two inscriptions in palmyrene dialect one posthumous dedication describing him as mtqnnʿ of the east derived from the aramaic root tqn meaning to set in order and the other describing his heir vaballathus with the same title albeit using the word pnrttʿ instead of mtqnnʿ
however the sort of authority accorded by this position is widely discussed
the problem arise from the word mtqnnʿ its exact meaning is debated
the word is translated to latin as corrector but restitutor is another possible translation the latter title was an honorary one meant to praise the bearer for driving enemies out of roman territories
however the inscription of vaballathus is clearer as the word pnrttʿ is not a palmyrene word but a direct palmyrene translation of the greek term epanorthotes which is usually an equivalent to corrector
according to david potter vaballathus inherited his father 's exact titles
hartmann points that there have been cases where a greek word was translated directly to palmyrene and a palmyrene equivalent was also used to mean the same thing
the dedication to odaenathus would be the using of a palmyrene equivalent while the inscription of vaballathus would be the direct translation
despite all the arguments it cannot be certain without doubt that odaenathus was a corrector
imperator totius orientis emperor of the entire east only the augustan history claims that odaenathus was conferred with this title and also goes so far as to claim that he was made an augustus co @-@ emperor following his defeat of the persians
both claims are dismissed by scholars
odaenathus seems to have been acclaimed as imperator by his troops which is a salutation reserved for the roman emperor this acclamation might explain the erroneous reports of the augustan history
regardless of the titles odaenathus controlled the roman east with the approval of gallienus who could do little but to formalize odaenathus self achieved status and settle for his formal loyalty
palmyra itself although officially still part of the roman empire became a de facto allied state to rome instead of a provincial city
outside of palmyra odaenathus authority extended from the pontic coast in the north to palestine in the south
this area included the roman provinces of syria phoenice palaestina arabia anatolia 's eastern regions and later following the campaign of <num> osroene and mesopotamia
in the spring of <num> the king marched north into the occupied roman province of mesopotamia driving out the persian garrisons and freeing edessa and carrhae
the first onslaught was aimed at nisibis which odaenathus regained but sacked since the inhabitants were sympathetic toward the persian occupation
the palmyrene monarch destroyed the jewish city of nehardea <num> km west of the persian capital ctesiphon as he deemed the jews of mesopotamia loyal to shapur
by late <num> or early <num> odaenathus stood at the walls of the persian capital
the exact route taken by odaenathus from palmyra to ctesiphon remains uncertain it is probably similar to the route emperor julian took in <num> during his campaign against persia
using this route odaenathus would have crossed the euphrates at zeugma then moved east to edessa followed by carrhae then nisibis here he would have descended south along the khabur river to the euphrates valley and marched alongside the river 's left bank to nehardea
after taking the city he penetrated the sassanian province of asōristān and marched along the royal canal naarmalcha towards the tigris where the persian capital stood
once at ctesiphon odaenathus immediately began the siege of the well @-@ fortified winter residence of the persian kings severe damage was inflicted upon the surrounding areas due to the battles with persian troops
the city held its ground and the logistical problems of fighting in enemy 's land probably prompted the palmyrenes to lift the siege
odaenathus headed north along the euphrates carrying with him numerous prisoners and booty
the invasion resulted in the full restoration of the roman lands osroene and mesopotamia provinces occupied by shapur since the beginning of his invasions in <num>
however dura @-@ europus and other palmyrene posts south of circesium such as anah were not rebuilt
odaenathus sent the captives to rome and by the end of <num> gallienus added persicus maximus the great victor in persia to his titles and held a triumph
the title was a symbol of legitimacy in the east starting with the assyrians then the achaemenids who used it to symbolize their supremacy over all other rulers and was adopted by the parthian monarchs following their defeat of the seleucids to legitimize their conquests
the first sassanian monarch ardashir i adopted the title following his victory over the parthians
odaenathus son was crowned with a diadem and a tiara the choice of the location was probably meant to express that the palmyrene monarchs were now the successors of the seleucid and iranian rulers who controlled syria and mesopotamia in the past
the title was probably a challenge not to the roman emperor but to shapur i odaenathus was declaring that he not the persian monarch was the legitimate king of kings in the east
a tessera depicting hairan i shows him wearing a crown shaped like that of the parthian monarchs so it must have been odaenathus crown this combination of title and imagery indicate that odaenathus considered himself the rival of the sassanians and the protector of the region against them
odaenathus intents are questioned by some historians such as drinkwater who attribute the attempted negotiations with shapur to odaenathus quest for power
however in contrast to the norm of his period when powerful generals proclaimed themselves emperors odaenathus chose not to usurp gallienus throne and minted no coins bearing his own image
the king had total control over his kingdom of palmyra and effective control over the roman east where his military authority was absolute
odaenathus respected gallienus privilege to appoint provincial governors but dealt swiftly with opposition the anonymus post dionem mention the story of kyrinus quirinus a roman official who showed dissatisfaction with odaenathus authority over the persian frontier and was immediately executed by the king
in general odaenathus actions were connected to his and palmyra 's interests only his support of gallienus and his roman titles did not hide the palmyrene base of his power and the local origin of his armies as with his decision not to wait for the emperor to help in <num>
odaenathus status seems to have been as watson put it something between powerful subject independent vassal king and rival emperor
inside palmyra no roman provincial official had any authority the king filled the government with palmyrene staffs
in parallelism to the iranian practice of making the government appear as a family enterprise odaenathus bestowed his own gentilicium septimius upon his leading generals and officials such as zabdas zabbai and worod
the palmyrene constitutional institutions continued to function normally during odaenathus reign he maintained the council and most civic establishments permitting the election of magistrates until <num>
when odaenathus was on campaign the kingdom was administered by a viceroy septimius worod
the evidence for the second campaign is meager zosimus is the only one to mention it specifically
a passage in the sibylline oracles is interpreted by hartmann as an indication of the second invasion
the campaign took place in <num> or <num> and was aimed directly at ctesiphon odaenathus reached the walls of the persian capital but had to cancel the siege and march north to face the influx of germanic riders attacking anatolia
according to syncellus odaenathus arrived at anatolia with hairan i and headed to heraclea but the riders were already gone
they loaded the spoils onto their ships but many perished in a sea battle probably conducted by odaenathus another possibility is that they were shipwrecked
the assassination took place either in anatolia or in syria while the king was returning to palmyra there is no consensus on the manner perpetrator or the motive behind the act
according to syncellus odaenathus was assassinated near heraclea pontica trying to quell a tribal incursion into pontus he gives the name of the assassin as another odaenathus who may or may not have been a relative of the king
the assassin was killed by the king 's bodyguard
hartmann support the theory that odaenathus was killed in pontus
zosimus simply mention that odaenathus was killed by conspirators near emesa at a friend 's birthday party without naming the killer
zonaras attributes the crime to a nephew of odaenathus but does not give a name
the augustan history claims that a cousin of the king named maeonius killed him while the anonymus post dionem names the assassin as another odaenathus
at the western end of the great colonnade at palmyra a shrine designated the funerary temple no
<num> also known as the house tomb is located
inside its chamber steps lead down to a vault crypt which is now lost
this mausoleum might have belonged to the royal family being the only tomb inside the city 's walls
an interesting passage in the work of the anonymus post dionem speaks of a certain rufinus who orchestrated the assassination on his own initiative then explained his act to the emperor who condoned the crime
this story talks about rufinus ordering the murder of an older odaenathus out of fear that he would rebel and has the younger odaenathus complaining to the emperor
since the older odaenathus odaenathus i was proved to be a fictional character the story was neglected by most scholars
however according to theodor mommsen younger odaenathus is an oblique reference to vaballathus rufinus should be identified with cocceius rufinus the roman governor of arabia between <num> <num>
the evidence for a roman conspiracy is very weak and can not be confirmed
family feud according to zonaras odaenathus nephew misbehaved during a lion hunt he made the first attack and killed the animal to the dismay of the king
odaenathus warned the nephew who ignored the warning and repeated the act twice causing the king to deprive him of his horse which is a great insult in the east
the nephew threatened odaenathus and was put in chains as a result hairan i asked his father to forgive his cousin and his request was granted but as the king was drinking the nephew approached him with a sword and killed him along with hairan i
the bodyguard immediately executed the nephew
zenobia the wife of odaenathus was accused by the augustan history of having formerly conspired with maeonius as hairan i was her stepson and she could not accept that he was the heir to her husband instead of her own children
however there is no suggestion in the augustan history that zenobia was involved in the event that saw her husband 's murder the act is attributed to maeonius degeneracy and jealousy
those accounts by the augustan history can be dismissed as fiction
the hints in modern scholarship that zenobia had a hand in the assassination out of her desire to rule the empire and dismay with her husband 's pro @-@ roman policy can be dismissed as there was no reversal of that policy during the first years following odaenathus death
persian agents or palmyrene traitors the possibility of a persian involvement exists but the outcome of the assassination would not have served shapur without establishing a pro @-@ persian monarch on the palmyrene throne
another possibility would be palmyrenes dissatisfied with odaenathus reign and the changes of their city 's governmental system
zenobia was the king 's second wife whom he married in the late <num> when she was <num> or <num> years old
the number of children odaenathus had with his first wife is unknown and only one is attested hairan i the name appears on a <num> inscription from palmyra describing him as ras implying that he was already an adult by then
in the augustan history odaenathus eldest son is named herod the inscription at palmyra dating to <num> celebrating hairan 's coronation mentions him with the name herodianus
it is possible that hairan of the <num> inscription is not the same as herodianus of the <num> but this is contested by hartmann who conclude that the reason for the difference in the spelling is due to the language used in the inscription herodianus being the greek version meaning that odaenathus eldest son and co @-@ king is hairan herodianus
the children of odaenathus and zenobia are vaballathus he is attested on several coins inscriptions and in the ancient literature
harian ii his image appear on a seal impression along with his older brother vaballathus as the sons of zenobia his identity is much debated
potter suggest that he is the same as herodianus who was crowned in <num> and that hairan i mentioned in <num> died before the birth of hairan ii
herennianus and timolaus the two were mentioned in the augustan history and are not attested in any other source herennianus might be a conflation of hairan and herodianus while timolaus is most probably a fabrication although dietmar kienast suggest that he might be vaballathus
possible descendants of odaenathus living in later centuries are reported lucia septimia patabiniana balbilla tyria nepotilla odaenathiana is known through a dedication dating to the late third or early fourth century inscribed on a tombstone erected by a wet nurse to her sweetest and most loving mistress
the tombstone was found in rome at the san callisto in trastevere
another possible relative is eusebius who is mentioned by libanius in <num> as a son of an odaenathus who was in turn a descendant from the king the father of eusebius is mentioned as fighting against the persians most probably in the ranks of emperor julian
in <num> libanius mentioned that eusebius promised him a speech written by longinus for the king
in the fifth century the philosopher syrian odaenathus lived in athens and was a student of plutarch of athens he might have been a distant descendant of the king
the augustan history claims that maeonius was proclaimed emperor for a brief period before being killed by the soldiers
however no inscriptions or other evidence exist for maeonius reign and he was probably killed immediately after assassinating the king
odaenathus was succeeded by his son the ten @-@ year @-@ old vaballathus under the regency of zenobia
hairan ii probably died soon after his father as only vaballathus succeeded to the throne
many writers wrote about deeds of odaenathus nicostratus of trebizond probably accompanied the king on his campaigns and wrote a history of that period starting from philip the arab and ending shortly before the king 's death
according to potter nicostratus account was meant to glorify odaenathus and demonstrate his superiority over roman emperors
the memory of odaenathus was highly esteemed in the roman empire the augustan history written in the fourth century places odaenathus among the thirty tyrants probably because he assumed the title of king
however it speaks highly of his role in the persian war and credit him with saving the empire had not odaenathus prince of the palmyrenes seized the imperial power after the capture of valerian when the strength of the roman state was exhausted all would have been lost in the east
the king was praised by libanius and was the subject of a prophecy in the thirteenth sibylline oracle then shall come one who was sent by the sun i

the following year he published a description of the species in journal and proceedings of the royal society of western australia
he placed it in section oncostylis of bentham 's taxonomic arrangement of banksia giving it the specific epithet violacea in reference to the violet flowers
thus the full name of the species with author citation is banksia violacea c

the species has been considered a variety of b
sphaerocarpa fox banksia this view was published by william blackall in his <year> how to know western australian wildflowers
he considered b
violacea to be a variety of b

this description was an invalid publication however and a nomen nudum
in <year> alex george declared banksia sphaerocarpa var
violacea blackall a nomenclatural synonym of b
violacea
in george 's <year> arrangement b
violacea was placed in subgenus banksia because its inflorescence is a typical banksia flower spike section oncostylis because of its hooked styles and series abietinae because its inflorescence is roughly spherical
it was placed in taxonomic sequence between b
incana hoary banksia and b
meisneri meissner 's banksia
in <year> kevin thiele and pauline ladiges published the results of a cladistic analysis of morphological characters of banksia
they retained george 's subgenera and many of his series but discarded his sections
b
ser
abietinae was found to be very nearly monophyletic and so it was retained
it further resolved into four subclades so thiele and ladiges split it into four subseries
b
violacea appeared in the last of these this clade became the basis of b
subseries longistyles which thiele defined as containing those taxa with very long and slender styles smoothly convex perianth limbs without a costal ridge and thickened margins
in accordance with their cladogram their arrangement placed b
violacea first in taxonomic sequence followed by b
laricina rose @-@ fruited banksia
however thiele and ladiges arrangement was not accepted by george who questioning the emphasis on cladistics rejected most of their changes in his <year> arrangement restored b
series abietinae to his broader <year> definition and abandoned all of thiele and ladiges subseries
george commented that the species has no close relatives being loosely allied to b
sphaerocarpa fox banksia and b
telmatiaea swamp fox banksia
despite this the sequence of the series was altered so that b

with respect to b
violacea mast 's results agree with its placement near b

however thiele 's b

early in <year> mast and thiele initiated a rearrangement of banksia by merging dryandra into it and publishing b
subgenus spathulatae for the taxa having spoon @-@ shaped cotyledons
they foreshadowed publishing a full arrangement once dna sampling of dryandra was complete in the meantime if mast and thiele 's nomenclatural changes are taken as an interim arrangement then b
violacea is placed in b
subgenus spathulatae
violacea occurs in southern regions of western australia from woodanilling to esperance and as far north as hyden
this distribution includes areas of the avon wheatbelt esperance plains and mallee biogeographic regions
it favours white sandy soils often overlying laterite clay or quartzite
it usually grows among heath and shrublands associated with mallee eucalypts and banksia sphaerocarpa var
caesia
banksia violacea is classified as not threatened under the <year> wildlife conservation act of western australia
these enhance solubilisation of nutrients thus allowing their uptake in low @-@ nutrient soils such as the phosphorus @-@ deficient soils of australia

violacea is highly susceptible to phytophthora cinnamomi dieback
banksia violacea is one of a small number of banksia species that has both lignotuberous and non @-@ lignotuberous populations
in both cases plants are adapted to release their aerial seed bank following a bushfire ensuring seedlings are established on clear and relatively fertile ground however the possession of a lignotuber makes plants much less reliant on fire regime for population maintenance and regeneration as maternal plants are not killed by bushfire but resprout from below ground level
lignotuberous plants generally occur among the north @-@ eastern populations in the vicinity of woodanilling
an investigation into the biogeography of these plants failed to find any vegetative climatic or other environmental factors associated with the possession of a lignotuber
banksia flowerheads in general play host to a variety of birds mammals and insects
however only wasps ants and flies were recorded visiting flower spikes during observations for the banksia atlas in the mid @-@ <num>
it is a slow @-@ growing plant that tends to become untidy with age and generally does not flower until four to five years after sprouting from seed
flowers are an unusual colour but occur within the bush where they grow within and are usually obscured by foliage
it tolerates light pruning not below the green foliage except for the variant with a lignotuber which may be pruned heavily
george recommends a sunny position in light sandy soil
professor margaret bernard sedgley of the waite institute suggests the species is of no value to floriculture as the inflorescences are too small and obscured by the foliage although she does add that the purple colour may be a worthwhile character to select for in plant breeding

howard belonging to the civic political party richmond non @-@ partisan association was elected to one of the three available seats on the richmond city council
after less than a year on council howard left the richmond non @-@ partisan association to join a new pro @-@ business political party richmond first which he saw as being less controlling and allowing him to make more independent decisions
he was re @-@ elected in the november <year> civic election with his richmond first party taking four of the eight council seats
on local issues howard was an advocate of opening richmond to gambling facilities which led to the river rock casino resort
he was supportive of heritage preservation measures but opposed richmond 's tree preservation bylaw
he was the only one on council who preferred the elevated option for the canada line then known as the richmond @-@ airport @-@ vancouver line whereas the other councillors preferred the ground level option or no skytrain extension at all

he also traveled to pierrefonds quebec and asia as part of the sister city program
he was not supportive of proposals to build a new soccer facility or financially contributing to tall ships tourism attractions

christy clark eventually won the leadership and became premier but like campbell did not include howard in the executive council
in march <year> premier clark promoted howard to a parliamentary secretary position under the ministry of transportation and directed to focus on air services agreements where he served until september
in early <year> howard was selected by bc liberal caucus chair gordon hogg to assist with the party 's investigation into the party 's alleged use of government resources and employees in partisan promotional efforts in certain ethnic communities
following a summer of deliberations on his future howard cited personal reasons including a desire to spend more time with his wife in his september <year> announcement that he would not be seeking re @-@ election in the up @-@ coming may <year> provincial general election
this decision was a surprise to his party because his richmond centre riding was considered a safe seat for him to be re @-@ elected
with no obvious successor a competitive bc liberal party primary began
by the end of the year two candidates announced their intention to run school trustee grace tsang and rcmp officer gary law
however howard approached teresa wat the ceo of the chinese language radio station chmb to be his replacement
though she did not live in the riding she was viewed as a better candidate and in january <year> the party announced she would be the candidate
while the other candidate tsang withdrew his nomination to accept a position on a political advisory committee law alleged he was harassed to drop out and requested a rcmp investigation
law decided to run as an independent candidate but only received xxx of the vote with wat winning the election and subsequently being named minister of international trade
following the election howard founded the non @-@ profit organization openskies4canada to advocate for open sky agreements to allow more airline competition in canadian international airports
the sole member of its genus the oribi was first described by the german zoologist eberhard august wilhelm von zimmermann in <year>
eight subspecies are identified
the oribi reaches nearly <num> – <num> centimetres <num> – <num> in at the shoulder and weighs <num> – <num> kilograms <num> – <num> lb

typically diurnal the oribi is active mainly during the day
small herds of up to four members are common males defend their group 's territory <num> – <num> hectares <num> – <num> acres large
the oribi is primarily a grazer and prefers fresh grasses and browses occasionally
a seasonal breeder the time when mating occurs varies geographically
unlike all other small antelopes oribi can exhibit three types of mating systems depending on the habitat – polyandry polygyny and polygynandry
gestation lasts for six to seven months following which a single calf is born births peak from november to december in southern africa
weaning takes place at four to five months
the oribi occurs in a variety of habitats – from savannahs floodplains and tropical grasslands with <num> – <num> centimetres <num>
<num> – <num>
<num> in tall grasses to montane grasslands at low altitudes up to <num> @,@ <num> metres <num> @,@ <num> ft above the sea level
this antelope is highly sporadic in distribution ranging from senegal in the west to ethiopia and eritrea in the east and southward to angola and the eastern cape south africa
the oribi has been classified as least concern by the iucn numbers have declined due to agricultural expansion and competition from livestock
the sole member of its genus the oribi is placed under the family bovidae
the species was first described by the german zoologist eberhard august wilhelm von zimmermann in <year>
the oribi was formerly included in the tribe neotragini that comprised a variety of other dwarf antelopes including dorcatragus beira madoqua dik dik neotragus oreotragus klipspringer and raphicerus
in <year> german mammalogist theodor haltenorth separated the oribi and raphicerus into a new tribe raphicerini later on zoologist jonathan kingdon assigned the oribi to ourebini a tribe of its own
the common name oribi pronounced ˈȯrəbē comes from the afrikaans name for the animal oorbietjie
in a revision of the phylogeny of the tribe antilopini on the basis of nuclear and mitochondrial data in <year> eva verena bärmann of the university of cambridge and colleagues showed that the oribi is the sister taxon to all other antilopines
the cladogram below is based on the <year> study
the following eight subspecies are identified of these zoologists colin groves and peter grubb identify o
o
hastata o
o
montana o
o
ourebi and o
o
quadriscopa as independent species in their <year> publication ungulate taxonomy
the head @-@ and @-@ body length is typically between <num> and <num> centimetres <num> and <num> in
sexually dimorphic males are slightly smaller than females except for o
o
ourebi in which females are smaller
this antelope features a slightly raised back and long neck and limbs
the glossy yellowish to rufous brown coat contrasts with the white chin throat underparts and rump
the bushy tail brown to black on the outside has white insides except in o
o
hastata that has a completely black tail
the subspecies show some variation in colouration o
o
ourebi is a rich rufous while o
o
hastata is yellower
only males possess horns the thin straight horns <num> – <num> centimetres <num>
<num> – <num>
<num> in long are smooth at the tips and ringed at the base
the maximum horn length <num>
<num> centimetres <num>
<num> in was recorded in <year> from malawi
the oribi has at least six different well @-@ developed scent glands such as the prominent preorbital glands near the eyes
the body has several modifications such as the large fossae below the eyes to accommodate such a large number of glands
females have four teats
the animal rests in cover during rain events
unlike all other small antelopes oribi can exhibit three types of mating systems depending on the habitat – polyandry polygyny and polygynandry polygyny tends to prevail as the female @-@ to @-@ male ratio increases
a study suggested that polygyny is preferred in areas of high predator risk as it leads to formation of groups as an anti @-@ predator measure
small herds of up to four members are also common
males defend their group 's territory <num> – <num> hectares <num> – <num> acres large female members may also show some aggression and drive away intruders
a study showed that the number of females that visit the male 's territory depends on the appearance particularly the symmetry of the male 's horns
males mark vegetation and soil in their territories by preorbital gland secretions and excrement the intensity of marking increases with the number of male neighbours
dominant males tend to have greater access to females in and around the territory than other males
an important feature of the social behaviour of oribi is the dung ceremony in which all animals form temporary dung middens
oribi at least three months old have been observed giving out one to three alarm whistles on sensing danger
these whistles are more common in adults than in juveniles and males appear to whistle more
common predators include carnivorans such as jackals
grasses can constitute up to <num> of the diet preferred varieties include andropogon eulalia hyparrhenia loudetia pennisetum and themeda species
mineral licks are also visited regularly
oribi have been observed feeding on flowers and boletus mushrooms
groups of oribi congregate in the rainy season when grasses are abundant
a seasonal breeder the time when mating occurs varies geographically
mating may peak in the rainy season august to september
when a female enters oestrus which lasts for four to six days it seeks the company of males
during courtship the male will pursue the female test her urine to check if she is in oestrus and lick her rump and flanks
gestation lasts for six to seven months following which a single calf is born births peak from november to december in southern africa
the newborn is kept in concealment for nearly a month the mother pays regular visits to her calf to suckle it for nearly half an hour
males may guard their offspring from predators and keep away other males
weaning takes place at four to five months
the oribi lives for <num> to <num> years in the wild and for <num> to <num> years in captivity
<num> – <num>
<num> in tall grasses to montane grasslands at low altitudes up to <num> @,@ <num> metres <num> @,@ <num> ft above the sea level
recently burnt areas often attract groups of oribi
the choice of habitat depends on the availability of cover needed to escape the eyes of predators
population densities typically vary between <num> and <num> individuals per km2 however densities as high as <num> individuals per km2 have been recorded in tropical grasslands that receive over <num> centimetres <num> in of annual rainfall and open floodplains
the oribi 's range overlaps with those of larger grazers such as the african buffalo hippopotamus hartebeest thomson 's gazelle and topi
these separate species often occur in close proximity to each other increasing predator vigilance
this antelope is highly sporadic in distribution it occurs mainly in eastern southern and western africa ranging from nigeria and senegal in the west to ethiopia and eritrea in the east and southward to angola and the eastern cape south africa
it is feared to be extinct in burundi
the total population as of <year> is estimated at <num> @,@ <num>
however the subspecies o
o
haggardi is listed as vulnerable because as of <year> the total population is estimated at less than <num> @,@ <num> mature individuals and is feared to be declining
hunting is a relatively minor threat since the oribi shows some tolerance to hunting
nevertheless the steep fall of <num> in oribi populations in comoé national park côte d 'ivoire has been attributed to poaching
numbers have also declined due to agricultural expansion and competition from livestock
the oribi occurs in a number of protected areas throughout its range such as gashaka gumti national park in nigeria the pendjari and w national parks benin aouk hunting zone chad benoue bouba njida and faro national parks cameroon manovo @-@ gounda st
floris national park central african republic garamba upemba and kundelungu national parks congo @-@ kinshasa omo national park ethiopia masai mara game reserve and ruma national park kenya golden gate highlands national park south africa serengeti national park tanzania kidepo valley lake mburo and murchison falls national parks uganda kafue and liuwa plain national parks and bangweulu swamp zambia

rihanna uses her lower register and heavy modulation to perform the most of the song and she growls the lyric the only thing i 'm missing is a black guitar
rihanna struts her stuff as she insists that she is a big shit talker as she proclaims that i 'll never play a victim i 'd rather be a stalker
sean fennessey for spin thought that when rihanna sings the line got my middle finger up i don 't give a fuck it sounded as though she had never sworn before due to how she preciously mewls the word fuck

on may <num> <year> rihanna released a <num> @-@ second sneak @-@ peek preview of the video on the internet whilst the full video premiered on may <num> <year> through the high @-@ definition music video website vevo
shortly after the video was released slash said that he was flattered that rihanna had impersonated him in the video saying the video is way better with her being me than with me being me
all things considered it brings an element of sexuality to it that i probably wouldn 't have been capable of
i think it 's hot
everything works out the way it 's supposed to
although slash is featured on rockstar <num> he does not appear in the music video
instead rihanna pays homage to him by impersonating him by presenting herself wearing a skull @-@ laden top hat wig leather jacket dark glasses and toothpick rihanna can be seen strumming a guitar slash 's style

it served as a chapel of ease to another church in the area st ceidio 's
some restoration work was carried out in the <num> century but st mary 's has since fallen into disuse and is now largely in ruins
it is a grade ii listed building a national designation given to buildings of special interest which warrant every effort being made to preserve them in particular because it is a late medieval church of exceptionally simple character and is virtually unaltered despite its poor condition
one writer has said that st mary 's has the distinction of probably being the most isolated church in anglesey
it is about <num>
<num> miles <num>
<num> km north of llannerch @-@ y @-@ medd towards the north of anglesey
it is reached by a footpath from a farm – it is only accessible on foot – and is surrounded by a churchyard
it was built in the <num> century as a chapel of ease to serve st ceidio 's church rhodogeidio about <num>
<num> miles <num>
<num> km to the east
restoration work was carried out in the <num> century but the church later fell into disuse
it has been in ruins since sometime between <year> when the survey by the royal commission on ancient and historical monuments in wales and monmouthshire recorded its condition as fair and <year> when it was given listed building status and its very poor condition noted
<num> by <num>
<num> m
it dates from the late medieval period and was constructed using rubble masonry and large stones
it had a slate roof although most of the roof has now gone and there is a bellcote at the west end which may be original rather than a later addition
there is no physical division between the nave and the chancel although one account in the <num> century said that there had originally been a screen separating them and some traces of it still remained at that time
entrance to the church was through a doorway with a square head in the north wall at the west end this dates from the <num> century
an inscribed stone near the doorway has the date <year> and some initials and it has been suggested that this marked the date of some renovation work
there are two windows on the south wall one fully blocked and one partially blocked
the small window at the east end of the church dates from the latter part of the <num> century
inside little remains but the ruins still have most of the original roof trusses one at the west end of the church is a replacement
there are some slate memorial tablets on the walls dating from the middle of the <num> century and a plain <num> @-@ century circular font
the <year> survey noted a bell dating from <year> and some portions of <num> @-@ century panelled seating near the pulpit these were not recorded when the church was given listed status in <year>
it was given this status on <num> may <year> and has been listed because it is a late medieval church of exceptionally simple character
cadw the welsh government body responsible for the built heritage of wales and the inclusion of welsh buildings on the statutory lists also notes that despite its very poor condition st mary 's is a virtually unaltered late medieval building even retaining the original roof trusses and in its isolation is characteristic of many churches on the island
writing in <year> the clergyman and antiquarian harry longueville jones called it a small plain single @-@ aisled chapel and said that one of the small south windows was a good specimen of its kind
a <year> guide to the churches of anglesey says that the roofless ruin of st mary 's has the distinction of probably being the most isolated church in anglesey
the novel follows peter who is in greenland with his father and mother for research on global warming and thea who lives in gracehope an underground colony located below greenland
first light explains how global warming is melting gracehope and peter and thea 's attempt to persuade the people to leave
the novel addresses the effects of global warming as a theme
stead began writing the novel in <year> but her first draft was confusing and unorganized
to help her she met editor wendy lamb who advised her to meet with a small group of people who would help critique the novel
after three years of work stead finished the second draft and met with lamb who once again helped make improvements and later published the novel
reviewers praised the description of gracehope and main characters as well as the performances of coleen marlo and david ackroyd who voiced thea and peter in a subsequent audiobook publication of first light
as a child growing up in a big city she was interested in the small towns which made her think that in smaller places everybody even the kids had special identities where as in a city people are pretty anonymous
an idea began to form for a hidden society that also served as a small town
stead began writing first light in <year> but had no experience prior to that
the first draft turned out confusing and unorganized
to help her stead met with wendy lamb an editor stead had met in a workshop a few years before
lamb suggested that stead meet with a critique group who would help read and revise the drafts stead wrote
after stead created a revised copy of the novel in <year> she sent it to lamb again and a contract was drawn up
more revisions were made in order to make the new world created in the novel easier to understand
stead found it hard to maintain a sense of the whole
over and over i mapped out the book out for myself using post @-@ its in a manila folder trying to get a sense of where the tension went
the novel took three years to complete
after the revisions were completed much of the plot stayed the same but several events in the original draft were cut out to strengthen the whole book
stead combined two characters into one having a stronger outline and also cut out several scenes for minor characters
in the end stead found that the revisions helped to make the book more cohesive
gracehope was formed hundreds of years ago by a group called the settlers who used to live in england
they possessed unusual abilities such as extremely good vision and hearing leading them to be called eye adepts and ear adepts respectively
these powers were seen as sorcery prompting grace the leader of the settlers to bring the settlers under the ice in greenland where they could live in peace
while walking around her house thea finds a map in her room of gracehope
the map shows a tunnel leading onto the surface
thea and her cousin mattias find the tunnel and meet peter who helps them back to gracehope
reaching gracehope peter realizes that several talismans of the people are in the shape of mitochondrial dna which his mom is studying
after waking up from a headache peter finds his mom next to his bed
she explains that she used to live in gracehope but was banished with her sister after her sister ventured above the surface and contracted an illness that could not be cured
she also explains that her research of mitochondrial dna relates to the ability of mutations to benefit the human body which could cause their extremely good vision and hearing
in the end she warns peter that global warming is causing gracehope to slowly melt away
the entire colony must learn the dangers they face and escape
one obstacle lies in their way rowen thea and peter 's grandmother who banished peter 's mom and did nothing to help thea 's mom when she was on her deathbed from an illness when she ventured aboveground
rowen is the head of the council in gracehope and is strictly against going aboveground
to convince the rest of the colony peter and thea plan to use a piece of mythology that a dog with four white paws would be born when it was time to leave
such a dog had been born several days ago but has yet to open his eyes
thea decides to proceed without using the dog and tries to convince the colony at a reenactment of the settler 's escape to greenland with several allies who know of rowen 's actions
just as thea and her allies are about to lose the argument peter arrives with the dog whose eyes are open
that coupled with the fact that peter is an eye adept the first in a hundred years convinces the colony to listen to thea instead of rowen
the novel ends eight months later as the people of gracehope are slowly educated on global warming and the dangers of staying in their colony
katie haegele from the philadelphia inquirer also listed the novel as a slow @-@ to @-@ unfold mystery combining elements of science and history with an appealing note of fantasy
kirkus reviews classified the novel as an ice @-@ age mystery as both peter and thea discover one another 's worlds as well as the truth about themselves
connie tyrrell burns from school library journal found the novel to be an exciting engaging mix of science fiction mystery and adventure
reviewers also noted the environmental theme in the book
kirkus reviews found that with the impending threat of global warning as an ominous backdrop teens from very different worlds find they have much in common
in the novel peter finds an underground civilization beneath greenland that is sinking as a result of global warming
burns felt that first light is a great discussion starter of issues ranging from global warming to shunning and building a new society
voya recognized the global warming theme and also classified first light as a coming @-@ of @-@ age tale
young readers will find this a journey worth taking
kirkus reviews found the novel to be a thoroughly enjoyable arctic adventure praising how the adventure tests the main characters courage as they learn the truth of both worlds
vicky smith from horn book magazine found the two main characters well written and the city of gracehope well structured
while smith found the city 's origin unbelievable she recognized that few people would care about that and compared the threat in first light similar to the one in the city of ember
jenifer hubert from booklist also compared the novel to the city of ember and to neal shusterman 's downsiders
hubert criticized the slow beginning and flaws in the mythology and structure of the underground world but still felt that the icy setting and global @-@ warming theme are well realized
the audiobook was released by the listening library and read by david ackroyd and coleen marlo for the parts of peter and thea respectively
kathy miller from school library journal praised the two readers for their performance which engages listeners and they are both adept at creating a different voice for each character and moving seamlessly between them
miller also found the novel useful for starting a discussion on topics such as political subterfuge and propaganda to global warming
a review from horn book review by jenifer brabander praised the easy shifts from american to english accents made by both narrators
brabander also found the tone given to thea appropriate and compared the novel to stead 's second work when you reach me feeling that t hough first light doesn 't reach the excellence of stead 's second novel the newbery @-@ winning when you reach me this audio will nevertheless draw listeners in with its narrators strong talent
it is situated atop the former aztec sacred precinct near the templo mayor on the northern side of the plaza de la constitución in downtown mexico city
the cathedral was built in sections from <year> to <year> around the original church that was constructed soon after the spanish conquest of tenochtitlan eventually replacing it entirely
spanish architect claudio de arciniega planned the construction drawing inspiration from gothic cathedrals in spain
the cathedral has four façades which contain portals flanked with columns and statues
the two bell towers contain a total of <num> bells
the tabernacle adjacent to the cathedral contains the baptistery and serves to register the parishioners
there are two large ornate altars a sacristy and a choir in the cathedral
fourteen of the cathedral 's sixteen chapels are open to the public
each chapel is dedicated to a different saint or saints and each was sponsored by a religious guild
the chapels contain ornate altars altarpieces retablos paintings furniture and sculptures
the cathedral is home to two of the largest <num> @-@ century organs in the americas
there is a crypt underneath the cathedral that holds the remains of many former archbishops
over the centuries the cathedral has suffered damage
a fire in <year> destroyed a significant part of the cathedral 's interior
the restoration work that followed uncovered a number of important documents and artwork that had previously been hidden
although a solid foundation was built for the cathedral the soft clay soil it is built on has been a threat to its structural integrity
dropping water tables and accelerated sinking caused the structure to be added to the world monuments fund list of the <num> most endangered sites
reconstruction work beginning in the <num> stabilized the cathedral and it was removed from the endangered list in <year>
after the spanish conquest of the aztec empire the conquistadors decided to build their church on the site of the templo mayor of the aztec city of tenochtitlan to consolidate spanish power over the newly conquered domain
hernán cortés and the other conquistadors used the stones from the destroyed temple of the aztec god of war huitzilopochtli principal deity of the aztecs to build the church
cortés ordered the original church 's construction after he returned from exploring what is now honduras
architect martín de sepúlveda was the first director of this project from <year> to <year>
juan de zumárraga the first bishop of the first see of the new world established in the viceroyalty of new spain promoted this church 's completion
zumárraga 's cathedral was located in the northeast portion of what is now the cathedral
it had three naves separated by three tuscan columns
the central roof was ridged with intricate carvings done by juan salcedo espinosa and gilded by francisco de zumaya and andrés de la concha
the main door was probably of renaissance style
the choir area had <num> seats made of ayacahuite wood crafted by adrian suster and juan montaño
however this church was soon considered inadequate for the growing importance of the capital of new spain
in <year> ecclesiastical authorities in valladolid ordered the creation of new and more sumptuous cathedral
in <year> an agreement was reached whereby the cost of the new cathedral would be shared by the spanish crown encomenderos and the indians under the direct authority of the archbishop of new spain
the cathedral was begun by being built around the existing church in <year>
when enough of the cathedral was built to house basic functions the original church was demolished to enable construction to continue
its design is a mixture of three architectural styles that predominated during the colonial period renaissance baroque and neo @-@ classic
initial plans for the new cathedral were drawn up and work on the foundation began in <year>
the decision to have the cathedral face south instead of east was made in <year>
in the same year construction commenced working from the gothic designs and models created by claudio de arciniega and juan miguel de agüero inspired by cathedrals found in spanish cities such as valladolid and jaén
because of the muddy subsoil of the site work on the foundation continued past the work on the walls to <year>
in <year> work on the first of the cathedral 's chapels began and by <year> the cathedral 's walls reached to about half of their final height
construction of the interior of the current cathedral began in <year> and what is now the vestry was where mass was conducted after the first church was finally torn down
in <year> work was interrupted by flooding over two metres in depth
parts of the city were damaged especially around the main plaza or zocalo
because of such damage this site was almost abandoned and a new cathedral project was begun in the hills of the tacubaya area to the west
despite these problems the project continued in its current location and under the direction of luis gómez de transmonte the interior was finished and consecrated in <year>
the cathedral still lacked bell towers the complete front facade and many of the other features it has now at the beginning of the <num> century
in <year> josé damian ortiz de castro was in charge of finishing work on the cathedral
he did most of the work on the bell towers putting in most of the fretwork and capping them with roofs in the shape of bells
with his death in <year> he did not live to see the cathedral completed and manuel tolsá finished the cathedral by adding the cupola the central front facade the balustrades and the statues of faith hope and charity at the top of the front facade
tolsa 's work was the last major construction to the cathedral and the appearance it had when he finished is the basic look the cathedral has today
the cathedral faces south and is approximately <num>
<num> metres <num> ft wide and <num> metres <num> ft long
it consists of two bell towers a central dome three main portals five naves <num> vaults <num> arches and <num> columns
inside the cathedral are five large altars sixteen chapels a choir area a corridor capitulary room and sacristy
the cathedral has approximately <num> windows
the main portal is centered in the main facade and is the highest of the cathedral 's three portals
statues of saint peter and paul the apostle stand between the columns of the portal while saint andrew and james the just are depicted on the secondary doorway
in the center of this doorway is a high relief of the assumption of the virgin mary to whom the cathedral is dedicated
this image is flanked by images of saint matthew and saint andrew
the coat of arms of mexico is above the doorway with the eagle 's wings outstretched
there is a clock tower at the very top of the portal with statues representing faith hope and charity which was created by sculptor manuel tolsá
the west facade was constructed in <year> and rebuilt in <year>
it has a three @-@ section portal with images of the four evangelists
the west portal has high reliefs depicting jesus handing the keys of heaven to saint peter
the east facade is similar to the west facade
the reliefs on the east portal show a ship carrying the four apostles with saint peter at the helm
the title of this relief is the ship of the church sailing the seas of eternity
the northern facade built during the <num> century in the renaissance herrera style is oldest part of the cathedral and was named after juan de herrera architect of the el escorial monastery in spain
while the eastern and western facades are older than most of the rest of the building their third level has solomonic columns which are associated with the baroque period
all the high reliefs of the portals of the cathedral were inspired by the work of flemish painter peter paul rubens
they are capped with bell @-@ shaped roofs made of tezontle covered in chiluca a white stone
ortiz de castro was in charge of the cathedral 's construction in the latter half of the <num> century until he died unexpectedly
manuel tolsá of valencia who had built other notable buildings in mexico city was hired to finish the cathedral
at this point the cathedral had already been <num> years in the making
he added the neo @-@ classic structure housing the clock the statues of the three theological virtues faith hope and charity the high balustrade surrounding the building and the dome that rises over the transept
the cathedral has <num> bells — eighteen hang in the east bell tower and seven in the west tower
the largest bell is named the santa maria de guadalupe and weighs around <num> @,@ <num> kilograms <num> @,@ <num> lb
other major bells are named the doña maria which weighs <num> @,@ <num> kilograms <num> @,@ <num> lb and la ronca the hoarse one named so because of its harsh tone
doña maria and la ronca were placed in <year> while the largest bell was placed later in <year>
the statues in the west tower are the work of josé zacarías cora and represent pope gregory vii saint augustine leander of seville st
fulgentius of écija st
francis xavier and saint barbara
the statues in the east tower are by santiago cristóbal sandoval and depict emilio rose of lima mary mother of jesus ambrogio jerome philip of jesus hippolytus of rome and isidore the laborer
in <year> a novice bell ringer died in an accident when he tried to move one of the bells while standing under it
the bell swung back and hit him in the head killing him instantly
the bell was then punished by removing the clapper
in the following years the bell was known as la castigada the punished one or la muda the mute one
in <year> the clapper was reinstalled in the bell
in october <year> a time capsule was found inside the stone ball base of a cross in the southern bell tower of the cathedral
it was placed in <year> supposedly to protect the building from harm
the lead box was filled with religious artifacts coins and parchments and hidden in a hollow stone ball
the ball was marked with the date of <num> may <year> when the building 's topmost stone was laid
a new time capsule will be placed in the stone ball when it is closed again
it also functioned and continues to function as a place to receive eucharist and register parishioners
the first church built on the cathedral site also had a tabernacle but its exact location is unknown
during the construction of the cathedral the tabernacle was housed in what are now the chapels of san isidro and our lady of agony of granada

the floor is covered with small marble slabs covering niches containing the remains of other people
the cathedral contains other crypts and niches where other religious figures are buried including in the chapels
forty @-@ two years were required simply to lay its foundation when it was first built because even then the spaniards recognized the danger of constructing such a huge monument in soft soil
however for political reasons much but not all of the cathedral was built over the remains of pre @-@ hispanic structures leading to uneven foundation from the beginning
on the altar of forgiveness much of the structure and decoration were damaged including the loss of three paintings the holy face by alonso lópez de herrera the martyrdom of saint sebastian by francisco de zumaya and the virgin of forgiveness by simon pereyns
the choir section lost <num> of its <num> seats as well a painting by juan correa along with many stored books
the two cathedral organs were severely damaged with the partial melting of their pipes
paintings by rafael jimeno y planas juan correa and juan rodriguez juarez were damaged in other parts of the cathedral
after the fire authorities recorded the damage but did nothing to try to restore what was damaged
heated discussions ensued among historians architects and investigations centering on the moving of the altar of forgiveness as well as eliminating the choir area and some of the railings
in <year> ecclesiastical authorities initiated demolition of the choir area without authorization from the federal government but were stopped
the government inventoried what could be saved and named jaime ortiz lajous as director of the project to restore the cathedral to its original condition
restoration work focused not only on repairing the damage using archived records and photographs but also included work on a deteriorating foundation due to uneven sinking into the ground and problems with the towers
the altars of forgiveness and of the kings were subject to extensive cleaning and restorative work
to replace the lost portions on the altar of forgiveness several paintings were added escape from egypt by pereyns the divine countenance and the martyrdom of saint sebastian
the organs were dismantled with the pipes and inner workings sent to the netherlands for repair while the cases were restored by mexican craftsmen with work lasting until <year>
reconstruction of the choir area began in <year> using the same materials as existed before the fire
in addition any statues in the towers that received more than <num> damage from city pollution were taken out with replicas created to replace them
those with less damage were repaired
some interesting discoveries were made as restoration work occurred during the <num> and early <num>
<num> paintings were found and rescued from behind the altar of forgiveness including works by juan and nicolas rodriguez juarez miguel cabrera and josé de ibarra
inside one of the organs a copy of the nomination of hernán cortés as governor general of new spain <year> was found
lastly in the wall of the central arch of the cathedral was found the burial place of miguel barrigan the first governor of veracruz
however the fact that the city is a megalopolis with over <num> million people drawing water from underground sources has caused water tables to drop and the sinking to accelerate during the latter half of the <num> century
sections of the complex such as the cathedral and the tabernacle were still sinking at different rates and the bell towers were tilting dangerously despite work done in the <num>
for this reason the cathedral was included in the <year> world monuments watch by the world monuments fund
major restoration and foundation work began in the <num> to stabilize the building
engineers excavated under the cathedral between <year> and <year>
they dug shafts under the cathedral and placed shafts of concrete into the soft ground to give the edifice a more solid base to rest on
these efforts have not stopped the sinking of the complex but they have corrected the tilting towers and ensured that the cathedral will sink uniformly
researcher manuel rivera cambas reported that the cathedral was built on the site sacred precinct of the aztecs and with the very stones of their temples so that the spaniards could lay claim to the land and the people
hernán cortés supposedly laid the first stone of the original church personally
it once was an important religious center used exclusively by the prominent families of new spain
in <year> during the second mexican empire emperor maximilian of habsburg and empress charlotte of belgium later known as maximiliano and carlota of mexico were crowned at the cathedral after the magnificent arrival to the head city of their reign
located on the zocalo it has over time been the focus of social and cultural activities most of which have occurred in the <num> and 21st centuries
the cathedral was closed for four years while president plutarco elías calles attempted to enforce mexico 's anti @-@ religious laws
pope pius xi closed the church ordering priests to cease their public religious duties in all mexican churches
after the mexican government and the papacy came to terms and major renovations were performed on the cathedral it reopened in <year>
the cathedral has been the scene of several protests both from the church and to the church including a protest by women over the church 's exhortation for women not to wear mini @-@ skirts and other provocative clothing to avoid rape and a candlelight vigil to protest against kidnappings in mexico
the cathedral itself has been used to protest against social issues
its bells rang to express the archdiocese 's opposition to the supreme court upholding of mexico city 's legalization of abortion
probably the most serious recent event occurred on <num> november <year> when sympathizers of the party of the democratic revolution attacked the cathedral
about <num> protesters stormed into sunday mass chanting slogans and knocking over pews
this caused church officials to close and lock the cathedral for a number of days
the cathedral reopened with new security measures such as bag searches in place

in <year> the silver service was transferred to the illinois executive mansion
it was written by the english archaeologist ralph merrifield the former deputy director of the museum of london and first published by b
t
batsford in <year>
merrifield opens the archaeology of ritual and magic by discussing how archaeologists have understood magic and ritual practices in past societies opining that on the whole it had been a neglected area of study
looking at the archaeological evidence for ritual activity in the pre @-@ roman iron age and the roman iron age of britain he discusses animal and human sacrifice as well as the offering of votive deposits in rivers and other bodies of water
he moves on to explore the rituals surrounding death and burial suggesting areas where this ritual activity is visible in the burial record of multiple societies
merrifield goes on to discuss the archaeological evidence for ritual practices in christian europe highlighting areas of ritual continuance from earlier pagan periods in particular the deposition of metal goods in water
looking at the evidence for foundation deposits in european buildings that likely had magico @-@ religious purposes he then looks at several examples of written charms and spells which have survived in the archaeological record
upon publication the archaeology of ritual and magic received predominantly positive reviews in academic peer @-@ reviewed journals such as folklore and the antiquaries journal
in ensuing years the book has been widely cited by scholars as an influential and pioneering text in the study of the archaeology of ritual and magic
gaining a london external degree in anthropology in <year> he developed a lifelong interest in the religious and magical beliefs of england
after serving in the royal air force during the second world war he returned to working at brighton museum but in <year> was appointed assistant keeper of the guildhall museum in the city of london
over a six @-@ month period in <year> and <year> he was stationed in accra ghana where he worked at the national museum of ghana organising the collection in preparation for the country 's independence from the british empire in march <year>
returning to the guildhall museum merrifield compiled the first detailed study of roman london for <num> years which was published as the roman city of london <year>
following the creation of the museum of london in <year> he became its deputy director a post which he held until his retirement in <year>
in the preface of the archaeology of ritual and magic merrifield noted that the book 's bias was to the archaeology of london and that this was particularly evident in its use of illustrations
he dedicated the book to the memory of h
s
toms the former curator of brighton museum and a one @-@ time assistant to the archaeologist augustus pitt rivers in his dedication merrifield noted that toms had been his first mentor in archaeology and folk studies
presenting this book as a rectifier he outlines his intentions and the study 's limitations
chapter one ritual and the archaeologist begins by describing the ritual deposits from the pre @-@ roman iron age sites of cadbury castle and danebury hillforts in southern britain
merrifield laments the fact that the majority of archaeologists particularly those studying literate historical periods have avoided ritual explanations for unusual phenomenon in the archaeological record he believes that they exhibit a ritual phobia
he contrasts this view with that of those archaeologists studying the neolithic and bronze age britain who have widely accepted the ritual uses of chambered tombs and stone circles
he specifies particular definitions for words such as ritual religion and superstition arguing that such terms must be used with precision by archaeologists
offering a case study he describes how neolithic stone axes were adopted as amulets or talismans in the later roman iron age onward in britain and that as such archaeologists should expect to find them in non @-@ prehistoric contexts
in the second chapter offerings to earth and water in pre @-@ roman and roman times merrifield explores the various forms of archaeological evidence for ritual deposits in the pre @-@ roman iron age and the roman iron age of britain
he provides an overview of the evidence for animal and human sacrifice as well as that in support of ritual offerings in bodies of water such as the river thames
merrifield deals with votive deposits on land in particular looking at the evidence for deposition in ditches shafts and wells
he rounds off the chapter by examining evidence for iron age rituals that took place at the commencement and termination of building constructions
chapter three rituals of death deals with the religious rituals accompanying death and burial and their visibility in the archaeological record
it explains the three main ways which human communities have dealt with the corpses of the dead through exposing them to elements and scavengers through inhumation and through cremation
looing at beliefs surrounding the afterlife merrifield discusses ways in which these beliefs might be visible in the archaeological record such as through the deposition of grave goods
discussing evidence for rituals of separation through which the deceased is separated from the world of the living including those that deal with the decapitation of the body merrifield then looks at the effect of christianity on burials in europe arguing that it brought a new intimacy with the dead through the collection of relics which was in contrast to the pagan beliefs of the roman empire which portrayed the deceased as unclean
the fourth chapter from paganism to christianity explores the continuing practice of ritual in christian europe
discussing the early roman catholic church 's demonisation of pagan deities merrifield states that the church continued propagating a form of polytheism through the cult of the blessed dead the veneration of saints and martyrs throughout the middle ages
discussing the ritual use of christian relics he also looks at votive offerings that were presented in a christian context at shrines and churches paying particular reference to the tradition of offering bent coins to shrines in late medieval england
examining the construction of churches on earlier pagan ritual sites he deals with evidence for the destruction of pagan statues by the early christians
chapter five survivals revivals and reinterpretations continues merrifield 's exploration of ritual practices in christian europe
he examines late- and post @-@ medieval items that have been deposited in rivers including swords and pilgrimage souvenirs speculating that their deposition might represent a survival from the pagan tradition of casting votive offerings into water
he speculates that the contemporary practice of throwing a coin into a fountain for good luck is a further survival of the custom
he then discusses the evidence for ritual foundation deposits under buildings noting the widespread medieval deposition of an animal 's head or jaw in a construction 's foundations presumably for protective magical purposes
proceeding to deal with the late- and post @-@ medieval deposition of pots under foundations he looks at their place in churches where it was believed that they aided the acoustics
continuing with this theme he discusses the british folk custom of burying a horse 's head under the floor to improve a building 's acoustics speculating as to whether this was a survival of the pagan foundation deposit custom
rounding off the chapter merrifield examines at magical items that have been intentionally placed in the walls chimneys and roofs of buildings in britain in particular the widespread use of dead cats and old shoes
in the sixth chapter written spells and charms merrifield discusses the use of the written word in magical contexts
highlighting archaeological examples from the ancient graeco @-@ roman world he looks at inscriptions on lead tablets that were buried in cemeteries and amphitheatres both places associated with the dead
moving on to the use of magic squares merrifield highlights various examples of the sator square in archaeological contexts before also discussing squares that contained numerical data with astrological significance
he rounds off the chapter with an examination of post @-@ medieval curses and charms containing the written word citing examples that have been found by archaeologists across britain hidden inside various parts of buildings
in the seventh chapter charms against witchcraft he deals with archaeological evidence for a variety of early modern and modern british spells designed to ward off malevolent witchcraft
after briefly discussing the role of holed stone charms he looks at the evidence for witch bottles making reference to their relation to beliefs about witches familiars
proceeding to focus on <num> and <num> @-@ century examples merrifield discusses the case of james murrell an english cunning man and his involvement with the witch bottle tradition
merrifield 's final chapter the ritual of superstition recognition and potential for study provides an overview of the entire book highlighting the evidence of ritual continuity from pre @-@ christian periods to the present day
pointing out what he sees as areas of further exploration for archaeologists he calls for systematic investigation of the subject
he highlighted how the work would be of benefit to folklorists by putting various charms then in museum exhibits – such as dead cats buried shoes and witch bottles – into the wider context of ritual activity
he opined that it was a little disappointing that the examples were almost all from london and the home counties but described the book as lucidly written carefully argued and well illustrated
in a short review for the antiquaries journal the historian of religion hilda ellis davidson praised the cautious and balanced arguments of merrifield 's work
she opined that it should be read by every archaeologist as a corrective to what she thought was their widespread ignorance of folklore noting that the wide array of evidence for ritual behaviour in the archaeological record would surprise many readers
the importance of merrifield 's book was discussed by the englishman brian hoggard an independent researcher who authored a <year> academic paper entitled the archaeology of counter @-@ witchcraft and popular magic
being published in the beyond the witch trials anthology edited by the historians owen davies and willem de blécourt hoggard recounted that the archaeology of ritual and magic was the notable exception to a trend in which archaeological studies of magic were restricted to small journals magazines and newspaper articles
the influential nature of merrifield 's work was also recognised by the medieval archaeologist roberta gilchrist of the university of reading
in an academic paper published in a <year> edition of the medieval archaeology journal gilchrist referenced merrifield 's study noting that it offered a rare contribution to the archaeology of ritual and magic in britain
in particular she highlighted his belief that many archaeologists dealing with literate cultures exhibited a ritual phobia as accurate

share capital was nok <num> million plus loans from the shipping company
braathens had made good money during world war ii with the participation in the norwegian shipping and trade mission and received permission to use us <num> million to purchase aircraft
the idea to start an airline had occurred to braathen in <year> when the ship brajara had engine trouble while en route to japan
the japanese shipyards could not guarantee that they could repair the ship and at first it was considered whether the ship should be towed to europe for repairs
the solution chosen was instead to have the necessary piece made in amsterdam and flown by klm
braathen wanted to have an airline that would be able to fly crew and supplies to his and other ships throughout the world — primarily in the far east
braathen traveled to the united states where he bought several used douglas c @-@ <num> dc @-@ <num> aircraft from the united states air force
these were rebuilt by texas maintenance company temco in fort worth texas giving them a capacity of <num> passengers or <num> passengers and <num> tonnes <num>

the next planes were ln @-@ hat norse skyfarer on <num> february <year> and ln @-@ nau norse trader on <num> march
the first route ran from oslo to cairo via copenhagen and paris on <num> january <year>
afterwards the company was chartered for several trips from paris and marseille france to lydda palestine and tunis tunisia

the company 's route to hong kong was the longest air route in the world

the first braathens safe flight was made on <num> february from oslo landing at amsterdam marseille cairo basra karachi culcutta and bangkok before hong kong where norske skyfarer landed on <num> march
total flight time was <num> hours
along the route braathens safe established contracts with agents or stationed their own employees
the regular services could be done with a round trip time of nine to ten days including overnighting in cairo karachi and bangkok and with technical revision of the plane in hong kong
at first there were semiweekly services but by the end of <year> these had increased to weekly
in june braathens safe bought a douglas dc @-@ <num> ln @-@ pas norse carrier and in august another dc @-@ <num> ln @-@ paw norse commander both from klm

this airline was granted a <num> @-@ year monopoly on domestic and international flights
according to the concession only routes that dnl were not willing to fly themselves could be granted to other airlines
by <year> braathens safe 's routes were so regular that several countries stated that a bilateral agreement would have to be negotiated for them to continue
however the concession that had been granted to dnl did not allow braathens to fly any scheduled flights
braathens safe applied for fifteen @-@ year concession on <num> february <year> minister of transport nils langhelle from the labor party knew that he would be violating dnl 's concession by granting braathens safe a concession but at the same time he was worried that braathens safe could easily flag out to another country from which dnl would receive no protection
the exception in dnl 's concession could not be used since dnl declared that they through the scandinavian cooperation scandinavian airlines system sas were planning to start a route to the far east
the directorate for civil aviation stated that it was unlikely that dnl sas would start such a route within a few years and recommended langhelle that braathens safe be granted the route
concession was granted by the norwegian parliament on <num> february <year> with a duration of five years
the airline had to follow the route oslo or stavanger – amsterdam – geneva – rome – cairo – basra – karachi – bombay – calcutta – bangkok – hong kong

in <year> it became increasingly clear that the sas @-@ cooperation was weak and that either a full merger or a discontinuation of the cooperation would be necessary
braathen suggested to the government that dnl fred
olsen airtransport and braathens safe should merge to create a new domestic airline but this proposal was rejected by both dnl and fred
olsen
in <year> the swedish branch of sas aerotransport aba and the danish branch det danske luftfartselskab ddl started a joint route to the far east
for a merger to be completed danish and swedish authorities required that sas be granted all international routes from norway meaning that braathens safe would lose its concession from <num> march <year>
the sas merger was completed on <num> august <year>
braathens safe applied for a concession on a route from norway to new york on <num> march <year>
this would allow the airline to connect the route to the hong kong @-@ flights giving one continual service
the proposal would involve the purchase of douglas dc @-@ 6b or lockheed l @-@ <num> super constellation aircraft
the proposal was rejected by the government on <num> april
the following year braathens safe applied to extend the route to tokyo but this was also rejected by the government
in <year> the company applied to purchase two super constellations to replace two sold dc @-@ <num> which was granted and on <num> january <year> for an extension of the concession for another ten years
on <num> november <year> the government rejected the concession application stating that norway was bound to grant the concession to sas on the basis of the merger agreement

the five routes would require nok <num> @,@ <num> in annual subsidies
the concessions were granted to dnl who allowed their partially owned subsidiary widerøe to fly the sea routes

the route stavanger – bergen – trondheim was awarded to vestlandske luftfartsselskap in <year> but this company filed for bankruptcy the following year
ålesund airport vigra was scheduled to open in <year> and both braathens safe and sas applied for the concession along with the route along the west coast
at first the ministry wanted to issue the concession on the route stavanger – bergen – ålesund – trondheim to braathens safe and the route ålesund – oslo to sas
but after negotiations braathens safe stated they were willing to fly the coastal route without subsidies if they were granted the oslo @-@ route since that would allow them to cross @-@ subsidize this was granted by the ministry
an agreement was then made between the ministry sas and braathens safe where both airlines would fly the routes oslo – trondheim oslo – stavanger oslo – kristiansand and kristiansand – stavanger – bergen braathens safe had a monopoly on the routes oslo – ålesund and bergen – ålesund – trondheim while sas was granted a monopoly on the routes oslo – bergen and oslo – trondheim – bodø – bardufoss

they were put into service on the main routes once daily oslo – trondheim once daily oslo – ålesund twice daily oslo – stavanger including one stopping at kristiansand and one trip daily bergen – ålesund – trondheim
the delivery of the friendships made the herons unnecessary and these were sold
the two dc @-@ <num> were kept as a reserve and were used for the first part of the summer schedules because of late delivery of ln @-@ suo
they were also used for charter
the airports at hamar farsund and tønsberg had too short runways for the friendship and these destinations were terminated

in <year> sas started the route stavanger – kristiansand – ålborg and in <year> on the route oslo – kristiansand – ålborg
the concession allowed sas to also take passengers on the domestic legs giving braathens safe competition on the routes to kristiansand

both airlines saw this as a strategic opportunity to get routes in each other 's territories

the two airports had been served by sas from oslo via trondheim

all concessions ended on <num> march <year> and the ministry extended them all one year
three new airports alta airport lakselv airport banak and kirkenes airport høybuktmoen were about to open and the ministry wanted to award new concessions that included these airports
braathens safe applied to operate to all the airports in northern norway but the contract was awarded to sas
the latter also applied to operate a route from northern norway via trondheim ålesund and bergen to stavanger while braathens safe in <year> again applied for an extension of the west coast route to northern norway
this was moderated to a direct route from tromsø airport to bergen which sas received permission for on <num> march <year>

a new neutral ticketing system smart was introduced in <year> for all travel agents in norway and sweden
following this braathens safe sold its stake in bergenske with a profit
starting with the delivery of the f @-@ <num> and <num> all planes were named after norwegian kings
the last three f @-@ <num> were also given such names
during the <num> braathens safe took delivery of eleven <num> supplementing the four f @-@ <num>
the third delivered ln @-@ sua had a cargo door on the side making it ideal for cargo flights
the three planes delivered in <year> had extended range tanks making direct flights to the canary islands possible
in <year> the company started looking into possible replacements for their fleet considering larger aircraft
the late <num> and early <num> was a time of economic problems for airlines worldwide
passenger numbers stabilized and braathens safe introduced a <num> discount to purchasers of <num> tickets at one time
the company hit nok <num> billion in revenue in <year>
discounted tickets were not sufficient to cover the increasing costs particularly related to fuel and the company introduced the internal campaign bra @-@ <num>
this involved a more market @-@ oriented management and a focus on service increase including better regularity and free coffee
during the summer the reduced demand made the airline introduce discounted summer tickets for nok <num> on any route in southern norway
this gave a <num> load factor the highest for the whole year
in <year> braathens safe bought <num> of dnl
it also applied though the sister company braathens helikopter for concessions for helicopter services from stavanger to offshore oil platforms
as a reaction the incumbent helikopter service applied for braathens safes west coast routes
at this point sas bought <num> of helikopter service
in <year> braathens safe introduced services to farsund airport using wet leased f @-@ <num> from busy bee
the same arrangement was used to connect haugesund to bergen and stavanger
in haugesund this was in competition with norving
busy bee @-@ operated planes were also used on routes from sandefjord in competition with norsk flytjeneste
the same year the cabin crew had a <num> @-@ day strike halting all flights
it was caused by the company paying lower wages than sas and busy bee
in <year> a new booking system was introduced that allowed overbooking
this gave increased revenue but the company had to start compensating rejected passengers with a full refund and a free seat on the next flight
on <num> december <year> the airline 's administration moved into the a new building the diamond located at fornebu
the frequent flyer program bracard was launched in september <year>
it was a cooperation with inter nor hotels and gave special privileges to travelers that made <num> full @-@ price trips per year with braathens
larger aircraft could be put into service on the main services from oslo gothenburg and stockholm while the <num> could be used to smaller destination and from other cities
on <num> february <year> the company announced that it had ordered two boeing <num> @-@ <num> planes with an option for two addition craft
the cost of the two firm orders was about nok <num> million
this would allow the aircraft to be used for both domestic scheduled flights and for charter and was configured with <num> seats
this was less than charter @-@ only airlines for instance britannia had their planes configured with <num> seats
braathens safe 's planes were delivered on <num> march and in november <year>
the following year showed increasing charter traffic although it only made up <num> of the company 's revenue
the company had considered the smaller boeing <num> but did not have sufficient range
also the airbus a310 was close to being chosen
the <num> were launched as first business class to charter travelers but the business model was not successful
the new consumer groups entering the market had low willingness to pay and the demand for premium charter services was low
the company was faced with not being able to charter out the plane because of the low seat numbers but could not put in the extra seats because of the aircraft also being used on the scheduled market
using so large aircraft on the short @-@ haul flights in southern norway gave little economy @-@ of @-@ scale and the airline seldom needed the increased capacity
braathens safe also had problems because from order to delivery the exchange rates had increased from <num> to <num> nok per usd almost doubling the price in nok
in <year> the two <num> where sold
two years later altas resor was sold and the following year saga
braathens safe closed its bases in gothenburg and stockholm but remained a charter operator with <num> from norway
following the decision to sell the two <num> management also decided to sell the four remaining f @-@ <num>
this would allow braathens to operate a fleet of pure <num> @-@ <num> giving lower operating costs
one <num> was taken out of service in <year> and the four f @-@ <num> sold in <year>
the same year seven more <num> @-@ <num> were delivered along with two more in <year> and <year>
by then braathens safes entire fleet consisted of nineteen <num> @-@ <num>
at the same time boeing had launched the <num> @-@ <num> a slightly larger aircraft with new cfm @-@ <num> engines
braathens safe considered the new aircraft but where concerned that it used a traditional mechanical cockpit
the airline also needed larger aircraft for the charter traffic and smaller aircraft for the domestic routes
the airline also considered the mcdonnell douglas md @-@ <num> and the airbus a320 but settled on the <num> following the announcement of the stretched <num> @-@ <num> with <num> seats and the shortened <num> @-@ <num> with <num> seats
these had glass cockpits and braathens safe would be among the first airlines to receive both models
to finance the purchase the airline sold all but two of the <num> @-@ <num> and leased them back
for some of the aircraft they received more money than they had paid
he had threatened a flight attendant with an air gun
he demanded to talk to prime minister kåre willoch and minister of justice mona røkke and a press conference to make a political statement
his demands were not met and he surrendered while the plane was parked in oslo
this was the first hijacking in norway
for instance ln @-@ suo flew <num> @,@ <num> hours with <num> @,@ <num> landings
the last flight was made on <num> december <year> and the aircraft sold for nok <num> million each
although the f @-@ <num> was taken out of service some of the routes on the west coast needed to be operated with smaller aircraft than the <num>
the company made an agreement to wet lease busy bee f @-@ <num> one some of the routes while the most trafficked ones would be taken over by <num>
a <year> government committee led by state secretary per arne watle recommended that more route be flown by both braathens safe and sas and that additional airlines be allowed to start other routes
on <num> september <year> braathens safe applied for the route trondheim – bodø – harstad narvik – tromsø and tromsø – longyearbyen
sas had stated that it was fine with them if other airlines started flying international routes they did not and on <num> october braathens safe also applied for the routes bergen – stavanger – paris bergen – stavanger – manchester oslo – stavanger – brussels and trondheim – bergen – newcastle
the applications were rejected and it was agreed upon that sas would retain all rights to fly internationally between oslo bergen stavanger gothenburg stockholm copenhagen and århus
a new round of concession applications were filed in <year> trondheim to northern norway tromsø – longyearbyen oslo – billund and oslo – alicante
the right @-@ winged willoch 's second cabinet decided to use three principles in issuing new concessions keeping the array of local routes granting concessions on the terms that the airlines would continue to cross @-@ subsidize routes and to introduce competition on the largest routes
braathens safe was given permission to fly oslo – bergen and western norway – trondheim – bodø – tromsø plus once daily oslo – trondheim – bodø as well as tromsø – longyearbyen
at the same time sas was allowed to fly freely on the routes oslo – trondheim and oslo – stavanger

the first <num> @-@ <num> ln @-@ bra was delivered to the airline on <num> july <year>
the <num> <num> @-@ <num> were gradually handed to their owners while seven <num> @-@ <num> and seventeen <num> @-@ <num> were delivered until <year>
the investment cost nok <num>
<num> billion
by the end of <year> the company had nok <num>

on <num> june <year> erik g
braathen son of bjørn g
took over as ceo at the age of <num>
in <year> busy bee filed for bankruptcy the company 's fleet of three fokker <num> were transferred to the newly established norwegian air shuttle which started wet @-@ leased operations along the west coast for braathens safe
as demand increased through the <num> the fleet was extended to six aircraft
on <num> august <year> the airline was granted concession to fly to billund in denmark
at the same time air @-@ x was granted concession to fly the route via sandefjord and skien
the route started on <num> may <year>
previously the rules stated that if sas flew to a non @-@ scandinavian destination from any capital no other scandinavian airlines could fly to that city
braathens safe lost many contracts in the charter market in <year> following scanair 's purchase of larger douglas dc @-@ <num> aircraft
on <num> may <year> braathens safe was awarded the concession a route from oslo bergen and stavanger to newcastle which opened on <num> april <year>
the airline was also awarded the route from tromsø to murmansk russia once per week from <num> january <year>
on <num> june <year> sas announced that all its services to london gatwick airport would be moved to london heathrow airport where most of its services had landed
the same day the ministry of transport announced that any scandinavian airline could apply for and receive concessions to fly to gatwick
on <num> june braathens safe applied to fly to london but instead wanted to fly to london stansted airport to have better landing slots
the concession was granted on <num> january <year> but the airline chose to not start the route
the company had been granted a concession to malmø in sweden and the route opened on <num> may <year> with two daily departures
this was later reduced to one
in october <year> the two airlines that flew from oslo to gatwick norway airlines and dan @-@ air filed for bankcruptcy
braathens safe immediately decided to start the route with a departure at about <num> <num> that would allow connections to the rest of the domestic network
six days later the first schedules were published in the newspaper slots and british permission was granted three days after that
another two days after that the service started
at the time denmark was a member of the european union eu while sweden and norway had applied and were awaiting referenda to determine membership
eu was working to deregulate the airline market from <year> which could cause problems for the scandinavian agreements
in preparation for this braathens safe started negotiations with linjeflyg of sweden and maersk air of denmark to crate an alliance to compete with sas
in particular the three airlines wanted to capture the two million passengers that travelled between the three scandinavian capitals oslo copenhagen and stockholm
instead sas was given permission to purchase linjeflyg in exchange for the swedish airline market being deregulated from <num> july <year>
from <num> october <year> the norwegian armed forces stopped chartering aircraft and started using scheduled flights to fly <num> @,@ <num> personnel annually
since most of the transport was between northern and southern norway this gave reduced revenue for braathens safe
braathens rederi founded braathens helikopter
the shipping company had signed an agreement with the oil companies norsk hydro phillips petroleum and statoil to provide helicopter transport for their crews to their offshore oil installations ekofisk oseberg gullfaks veslefrikk
this was the first time the incumbent helikopter service had received competition on their offshore helicopter services
the initial agreement secured braathens helikopter a revenue of nok <num> million in the course of five years and gave the company a <num> market share
four <num> @-@ seet aérospatiale super puma helicopters were ordered each costing nok <num> million
total investment costs were nok <num> million
two helicopters were stationed at stavanger airport sola and two at bergen airport flesland
the initial contract involved flying <num> @,@ <num> passengers per year
twenty @-@ two pilots were hired along with a total staff of <num> and services started on <num> september <year>
in june <year> braathens helikopter signed a three @-@ year agreement with amoco for flights from stavanger to valhall
the contract had an option for a two @-@ year extension
the revenue was between nok <num> and <num> million depending on the length of the contract and the capacity needed
operations started in february <year> and involved the company purchasing another two super pumas
on <num> september braathens helikopter was awarded the contract with british petroleum for flights from stavanger to ula and gyda
the contract gave a revenue of up to nok <num> million in the course five years
operations started on <num> november <year> and involved about <num> @,@ <num> hours of flying per year
with this contract braathens helikopter had about a <num> market share
braathens purchased one more super puma as a consequence of the contract
after operations started the company had grown to <num> employees and was the second @-@ largest helicopter operator in the country
braathens helikopter and helikopter service announced on <num> october <year> that the two companies would merge from <num> january <year>
ludvig g
braathens rederi would be paid with nok <num> million in helikopter service shares
the norwegian competition authority stated they would have to look at the merger since the new company would have an almost @-@ monopoly on offshore flights
however the ministry stated that the authority could not hinder the merger because by the time new contracts were awarded in <year> helicopter operators from foreign countries would also be allowed to bid
the ownership of braathens helikopter was transferred to helikopter service on <num> december
ludvig g
braathens rederi received <num> of the shares in the merged company
they were immediately sold giving ludvig g
braathens rederi a nok <num> million profit on the five @-@ year venture
a norman he was a member of the cathedral clergy at rouen before becoming a royal clerk under king william i of england and subsequently his son king william ii rufus
gerard was appointed lord chancellor by william i and he continued in that office under rufus who rewarded him with the bishopric of hereford in <num>
gerard may have been with the king 's hunting party when william ii was killed as he is known to have witnessed the first charter issued by the new king henry i of england within days of william 's death
soon after henry 's coronation gerard was appointed to the recently vacant see of york and became embroiled in the long @-@ running dispute between york and the see of canterbury concerning which archbishopric had primacy over england
gerard managed to secure papal recognition of york 's claim to jurisdiction over the church in scotland but he was forced to agree to a compromise with his counterpart at canterbury anselm over canterbury 's claims to authority over york although it was not binding on his successors
in the investiture controversy between the king and the papacy over the right to appoint bishops gerard worked on reconciling the claims of the two parties the controversy was finally resolved in <num>
gerard was a patron of learning to the extent that he urged at least one of his clergy to study hebrew a language not commonly studied at that time
he himself was a student of astrology which led to suggestions that he was a magician and a sorcerer
partly because of such rumours and his unpopular attempts to reform his cathedral clergy gerard was denied a burial inside york minster after his sudden death in <num>
his successor as archbishop subsequently had gerard 's remains moved into the cathedral church from their initial resting place beside the cathedral porch
his parents were osbert and anna and his brother peter was also a royal clerk
where he was born and raised is unknown he is documented as cantor of rouen cathedral and precentor of the same cathedral although the date of his appointment to either office is unrecorded
by <num> he had become archdeacon of rouen
he served in the royal chancery under successive kings of england william i and william ii
he continued as chancellor to william rufus until <num> what precipitated his loss of office is unclear
he retained the king 's trust for rufus employed him in <num> along with william warelwast on a diplomatic mission to pope urban ii regarding archbishop anselm receiving the pallium the sign of an archbishop 's authority
rufus offered to recognise urban as pope rather than the antipope clement iii in return for anselm 's deposition and the delivery of anselm 's pallium into rufus custody to dispose of as he saw fit
the mission departed for rome in february <num> and returned by whitsun with a papal legate walter the cardinal bishop of albano who had anselm 's pallium
the legate secured rufus recognition of urban but subsequently refused to consider anselm 's deposition
rufus resigned himself to anselm 's position as archbishop and at the king 's court at windsor he consented to anselm being given the pallium
although not yet ordained gerard was rewarded with the bishopric of hereford and he was consecrated by archbishop anselm on <num> june <num> his ordination as a deacon and priest had taken place the previous day
he assisted at the consecration of st paul 's cathedral in london on <num> june <num>
he may have been a member of the hunting party in the new forest on <num> august <num> when rufus was killed as he witnessed king henry i 's coronation charter – now known as the charter of liberties – three days later at winchester close by the new forest
gerard was present at henry 's coronation that same day along with maurice bishop of london
henry was probably crowned by maurice but the medieval chronicler walter map states that gerard crowned henry in return for a promise of the first vacant archbishopric
gerard may have assisted maurice in the coronation ceremony
no source mentions him being invested by the king but as anselm urged pope paschal ii to give gerard his pallium which he would have been unlikely to do if gerard had been invested by henry that possibility seems remote
at whitsun in <num> king henry i with anselm 's support deprived ranulf flambard bishop of durham of the lands of the see of durham because ranulf had defected to henry 's elder brother robert curthose who also claimed the english throne
gerard then deposed ranulf from his bishopric
soon after his translation to york gerard began a long dispute with anselm claiming equal primacy with the archbishop of canterbury and refusing to make a profession of canonical obedience to anselm part of the long canterbury – york dispute
at the <num> council of westminster gerard reportedly kicked over the smaller chair provided for him as archbishop of york and refused to be seated until he was provided with one as large as anselm 's
he travelled to rome in <num> to receive his pallium from the pope to whom he presented the king 's side against anselm in the controversy surrounding investitures
the pope decided against the king but gerard and two other bishops reported that the pope had assured them that the various papal decrees against the lay investiture of bishops would not be enforced
their claim was denied by anselm 's representatives and the pope who excommunicated gerard until he recanted
gerard secured papal recognition of york 's metropolitan see for the scots
he subsequently consecrated roger as bishop of orkney but refused to consecrate thurgot to the see of st andrews because thurgot would not recognise the primacy of york
gerard gave generously to the monasteries of his diocese the medieval chronicler hugh the chantor stated that thomas ii gerard 's successor accused gerard of having dissipated the diocese 's endowment
king olaf i of man and the isles wrote to g archbishop of york asking for the consecration of our bishop by york but it does not appear to have taken place under gerard or his successor
during the first four years of henry 's reign gerard was one of the king 's chief advisors along with robert of meulan count of meulan in normandy and later earl of leicester
gerard was one of henry 's greatest supporters among the bishops during the investiture crisis
in <num> gerard witnessed a treaty between henry and robert the count of flanders which sought as far as possible to distance robert from any future conflict between henry and his elder brother robert curthose or between henry and king philip i of france
after gerard 's return from rome he restored ranulf flambard to the see of durham
in <num> anselm refused to consecrate three bishops two of whom had received investiture from the king gerard offered to consecrate them instead but all except one refused
from <num> onwards gerard slowly began to embrace the papal position on investiture of bishops which opposed laymen investing bishops with the symbols of episcopal authority
as part of his change of position gerard withdrew from court to care for his diocese
towards the end of <num> gerard attempted to join bohemond of antioch who was assembling a crusading force in france but it appears that king henry prevented gerard 's departure
in <num> gerard wrote to bohemond that he was still preparing to go on crusade but he never did
at about the same time gerard was working to find a mutually acceptable resolution to the investiture crisis writing a number of letters and other works supporting anselm 's and the pope 's position
by <num> king henry and anselm had reached an agreement settling the dispute
gerard agreed to a compromise on the matter of obedience to anselm
king henry proposed that anselm accept a witnessed oath from gerard that he would remain bound by the profession he made to anselm on his consecration as bishop of hereford
gerard made this oath at the council of westminster in <num>
it was a victory for canterbury but not a complete one as gerard avoided making a written profession and it was specific to gerard not to his office
gerard continued to oppose anselm 's attempts to assert canterbury 's primacy but the two were reconciled before gerard 's death
gerard also had an uneasy relationship with his cathedral chapter after attempting to reform his cathedral clergy by forcing them to give up their wives and concubines and become ordained priests
he wrote to anselm in <num> complaining of the intransigence of his clergy and envying anselm 's better relations with canterbury 's chapter which was composed of monks instead of the secular canons who made up york minster 's chapter
in this correspondence gerard complained that some of the york canons refused to be ordained as priests thereby hoping to avoid taking the vow of celibacy
he also accused them of accepting prebends but refusing to live or work at the cathedral and of focusing on a narrow legal definition of celibacy without actually being celibate
the canons argument was that they were only required not to maintain women in their own houses but they were not forbidden to visit or entertain women in houses belonging to others
it was not only gerard who complained about the relationship between him and his canons the latter accused gerard of impoverishing york by making gifts of lands to others
the medieval chronicler william of malmesbury charged gerard with immorality avarice and the practice of magic
gerard encouraged at least one of his clergy to study hebrew a language not normally studied at the time
some chroniclers considered his ownership of a hebrew psalter to be disturbing seeing it as a sign of heresy or secret judaism
among the sins that malmesbury imputed to him was the study of julius firmicus maternus a late roman astrologer every morning which to malmesbury meant that gerard was a sorcerer
malmesbury further claimed that gerard was lewd and lustful
in gerard 's favour anselm regarded him as learned and highly intelligent
some verses composed by gerard survive in unpublished form now in the british library manuscript collection as part of manuscript cotton titus d
xxiv
a collection of his letters circulated in the mid @-@ <num> century part of a bequest made to bec abbey in <num> by philip de harcourt the bishop of bayeux but it is now lost
gerard died suddenly on <num> may <num> at southwell on his way to london to attend a council
his body was found in an orchard next to a book of curious arts his copy of julius firmicus
his canons refused to allow his burial within his cathedral but their hostility probably owed more to gerard 's attempts to reform their lifestyle than to his alleged interest in sorcery
gerard was at first buried beside the porch at york minster but his successor thomas moved the remains inside the cathedral church
it was first broadcast by bbc three on <num> march <year> and repeated on bbc two one week later
the episode was written by phil ford directed by ashley way and produced by richard stokes
the episode featured the five initial series regulars john barrowman eve myles burn gorman naoko mori and gareth david lloyd plus recurring actor kai owen in a central role
the episode centers on the marriage of torchwood employee gwen cooper eve myles to her long @-@ term partner rhys williams kai owen
the wedding is complicated by gwen 's sudden impregnation by a shape @-@ shifting alien nostrovite
although she resolves to see her wedding through her nuptials are interrupted by an attack from the biological mother of the alien fetus played successively by collette brown nerys hughes and john barrowman
with the help of rhys and gwen 's torchwood colleagues the fetus is neutralised and the attacking alien defeated
gwen and rhys marry and their families have their memories of the wedding day wiped
the episode was designed to be the most humorous of torchwood 's second series and incorporated elements of broad comedy and soap opera style storytelling to the monster of the week story
it was filmed largely on location in south wales — prominent locations included the tourist attractions margam country park and dyffryn gardens — and featured an ensemble of previously unseen welsh characters
the episode was seen by an aggregated total of <num>
<num> million viewers across its three debut showings in the united kingdom
critical response was extremely mixed
some reviewers praised the inclusion of a less serious episode in the series whilst others felt that the comedy in the episode was too overt and detracted from the overall tone of the show
her boss jack harkness john barrowman kills the alien and gwen attends her hen night though is troubled by her wound
she wakes up the next morning heavily pregnant
jack arrives along with torchwood 's medic owen harper burn gorman to examine gwen and tries to persuade her to cancel her wedding
gwen 's fiancee rhys kai owen also tries to postpone the wedding in gwen 's interest but gwen insists that the wedding go ahead as she desires nothing more than to marry him
the sudden pregnancy is explained to gwen and rhys families as their own child
gwen 's mother sharon morgan and father william thomas are excited at the prospect of a grandchild but rhys parents suspect gwen of being pregnant by another man
torchwood agent toshiko sato naoko mori is sent to the wedding venue to keep an eye on gwen and to deliver a new wedding dress to accommodate her alien pregnancy
at torchwood 's cardiff headquarters owen determines from an autopsy that the alien that impregnated gwen is a nostrovite a race of carnivorous shape shifters who hunt in pairs and mate for life
he tells jack that after fertilisation the female transfers her eggs to the male who plants them in a host body until they are ready to hatch
later the female kills the host to release the offspring
at the wedding venue the female nostrovite colette brown murders and partly devours wedding guest mervyn
toshiko investigates along with rhys best man banana boat jonathan lewis owen and they are subsequently captured by the alien who intends to feed on them later
as gwen and rhys prepare to say their wedding vows jack runs up the aisle and demands that the wedding be halted
owen and ianto gareth david @-@ lloyd free toshiko but the half @-@ eaten corpse of mervyn is discovered by his wife a bridesmaid who alerts the entire wedding party to the murder
the nostrovite reveals herself and is chased away by jack escaping through a window
jack questions owen about gwen and rhys and he states that rhys mother brenda nerys hughes is with them
tosh mentions that she saw brenda with gwen 's mother mary in the garden
tosh and jack rush to the couple 's room where jack identifies brenda as an alien and calls her an ugly bitch
after brenda protests her innocence and rhys punches jack gwen states that rhys mother is not the shapeshifter as brenda wears a distinctive perfume
torchwood reach the garden to find the nostrovite in brenda 's image with mary
the alien holds mary hostage demanding that gwen give her her child
gwen walks towards them and as the nostrovite releases mary gwen reveals a hidden gun in her wedding bouquet and fires at the creature
owen suggests using a piece of alien equipment called the singularity scalpel to destroy the alien fetus
he sends gwen to her room and teaches rhys how to use the scalpel owen cannot use it himself due to injuries sustained in his undead state
gwen is approached by jack and reveals to him that she would have married rhys a long time ago if she had not met him
she leans in as he appears to be ready to kiss her but he reveals himself to be the nostrovite
owen enters shooting the creature whilst gwen exits with rhys
the nostrovite still in jack 's form attempts to attack owen only to be repelled by the fact he is dead
rhys and gwen find refuge in a barn and rhys explains owen 's plan to remove the fetus
as the nostrovite launches an assault on the door of the barn rhys succeeds in destroying the fetus
the nostrovite enters again impersonating rhys mother
she attacks rhys who attempts to protect himself with a chainsaw which malfunctions
jack arrives and kills the alien with a more powerful gun
he shares a moment of joy with gwen before praising rhys own display of heroism and telling him that the hero always gets the girl
rhys and gwen return to the wedding venue and are married
at the wedding reception they notice the guests all suddenly falling asleep
jack reveals that he has drugged them all with amnesia pills mixed with sedative so that they will not remember the events of the day
jack offers gwen and rhys retcon too but gwen declines as she does not wants any secrets in her marriage to rhys
as gwen and rhys anticipate their honeymoon torchwood clear up the mess left behind
later jack enters the hub alone and retrieves an old tin box from his office
he looks through photographs from his past reminiscing before picking up a picture of himself and an unidentified bride at their wedding
writer phil ford felt the episode to be reminiscent of a soap @-@ opera as well as possessing science fiction elements
he describes the episode as coronation street meets torchwood
ford was chosen to write this episode because of his own involvement as a writer on coronation street and executive producer russell t davies view that this would enable him to handle a wedding with comedic elements
as the most humorous episode of the series it was deliberately scheduled alongside a series of darker episodes to provide a contrast
describing the tone of the episode ford describes it as an all out romp and an action rollercoaster ride with a lot of comedy in it as much as thrills and nasty monsters
davies stated that the whole point of the episode is to have a right old laugh
expanding on the comedic aspects something ford considered whilst writing the episode was that the trick is to have the comedy come out of the characters rather than the scenario itself
it was eve myles idea to have gwen compulsively eat gherkins after waking up pregnant the script had only specified the character drinking a glass of water
the episode also plays on gwen 's conflicted feelings between jack and rhys
davies felt it would be irresistible to have the wedding temporarily halted by the one man rhys doesn 't want to see running down the aisle
ford stated that whilst jack is the series hero rhys is the hero of this episode
he compares a sequence where rhys arms himself with a chainsaw to defend gwen to the character being in evil dead mode
producer richard stokes commented that the episode illuminated that even though gwen s put rhys through some really difficult times she really does love him and want to be with him
in an early draft of the script gwen and rhys had their memories wiped at the end of the episode in addition to the other guests and were convinced by jack that the wedding had been problem free
william thomas and sharon morgan were cast as gwen 's parents geraint and mary cooper
davies re @-@ introduced the characters during the fourth series of the show considering thomas and morgan to be two fine welsh actors
thomas had previously appeared as two different characters in the <year> doctor who serial remembrance of the daleks and the <year> doctor who episode boom town
upon appearing in something borrowed he became the first actor to have appeared in all three of the classic series new series and torchwood
nerys hughes played rhys mother brenda williams in addition to a duplicate form of the alien nostrovite
like thomas she had previously appeared in a doctor who serial the <year> story kinda
hughes enjoyed getting to play a monster for the first time in her career which involved having fangs and claws and red eyes and being wired up so all this black blood can ooze out when i get shot
despite the funny aspect of the script hughes took the role seriously stating that everyone plays it for real and that you can 't camp it up
she believed that as an actor you 've got to believe what you 're doing
kai owen describes thomas morgan and hughes collectively with robin griffith barry williams as a good old @-@ fashioned welsh cast who know what it 's all about
jonathan lewis owen was cast as rhys best man banana boat a character referred to sporadically since torchwood 's first series premiere everything changes <year>
in keeping with the character 's name he was given a pair of banana patterned cuff links to compliment his costume
as a joke eve myles who jonathan owen had previously worked with in other projects left a banana skin on his car on his first day of filming
collette brown played carrie the original human form of the mother nostrovite
to transform her into the alien creature the actress was required to spend approximately an hour having make @-@ up applied
brown was surprised at the efficiency of the make @-@ up artists as she had expected the transformation process to take longer
originally the human versions of the nostrovite shapeshifter were intended to be more monstrous but davies felt it was important that the audience would still be able to recognise the actor underneath once the make up had been applied
the sequence of jack ianto and owen leaving for gwen 's wedding was recorded at roald dahl plass on <num> october <year>
a number of locations were used for the wedding venue
producer richard stokes notes that it felt like we were organising a real wedding but one that was being shot in about five different venues
director ashley way states that in directing the wedding scenes the production team had to make sure that the colour scheme co @-@ ordinated in regards to aspects like the bridesmaids costumes and the flower patterns
costume designer ray holman experienced difficulty sourcing a maternity wedding dress to accommodate the nine @-@ month baby bump worn by eve myles
he remarks that in trying to source three such dresses from bridal shops in cardiff he was regarded as if i was the biggest sinner in the world and ended up designing the dress worn by gwen himself
the main location shoot for the episode was at margam country park in margam port talbot in and around a converted orangery which provided a location for the wedding and reception
way states that one of the reasons margam 's orangery was chosen for the shoot was because of the fantastic windows which provided a good visual opportunity in regards to a sequence involving the alien carrie jumping out of them
however due to its listed building status the production crew were not able to remove the window glass for filming and had to construct replica windows on separate scaffolding using resin glass
the hotel exteriors and sequences set in the gardens of the wedding venue were filmed at dyffryn gardens in st nicholas vale of glamorgan
the hotel interiors were partly recorded at court colman manor in the village of pen @-@ y @-@ fai bridgend and partly in studio
the opening sequence of the episode where gwen pursues the shape @-@ shifter was recorded on <num> november in a men 's public toilet in the hayes a shopping area in central cardiff
the episode featured a large amount of incidental music
during gwen 's hen night the club she is in plays the tracks filthy gorgeous and comfortably numb by the scissor sisters from their eponymous <year> album and the single hole in the head from the sugababes <year> album three
the song heard on gwen 's radio alarm clock when she wakes up heavily pregnant is fire in my heart from the welsh rock band super furry animals
at gwen and rhys wedding reception the records played include you do something to me by paul weller and the song tainted love by soft cell
one of the black and white photos of jack seen at the end of the episode is actually a promotional picture of john barrowman from his role as billy flynn in the musical chicago
the episode was first broadcast on bbc two on <num> march at <num> <num> pm with a pre @-@ watershed repeat airing on <num> march at <num> <num> pm

ben rawson @-@ jones of digital spy gave the episode five stars out of five summarising it as an energetic romp that oozed with body horror that would make david cronenberg proud which also infused a type of family melodrama commonly seen on soaps
he praised the stunningly bonkers plot noting that every potential dramatic and comedic moment that stemmed from gwen 's unconventional bun in the oven scenario was fully maximised
he felt that in the central role eve myles delivered an outstanding performance as gwen and also singled out the guest actors for praise particularly nerys hughes
in an end of series review he listed something borrowed as his favourite episode of torchwood 's second series
writing for the stage mark wright wrote that it ’ s good to see torchwood can get in touch with its lighter side and not lose any momentum concluding i think i really might love this show
jon beresford of tv scoop felt the episode to be one of the strongest of the second series
whilst he felt it to be corny in places he summarised the episode as an exciting yarn with some really good performances from the team
he felt that myles and owen stole the show as gwen and rhys believing that there 's a definite spark between these two that sets their moments apart
joan o 'connell hedman of slant magazine felt the episode to be the strongest of the second series
she praised the uniformly fantastic guest cast and the drop dead gorgeous exterior and interior locations
she singled out writer phil ford for considerable praise feeling that he wrote the episode true to the characters while filling in backstory we had no way of imagining and delivered drama action and laughs
brad trechak of aol tv felt the more comic episode was a welcome respite from darker episodes
he praised the episode for being light and fluffy yet it furthered things along with regard to the torchwood universe and its characters
reviewing the episode brigid cherry of total sci @-@ fi felt that contrary to expectation – it ’ s hilarious
she praised the comedy provided from eve myles gareth david @-@ lloyd and nerys hughes in particular as well as the terrifying moments that threaten to tip over into gross @-@ out horror @-@ comedy
she felt overall the offbeat self @-@ parody made a welcome change from the show 's more serious episodes and rated it eight out of ten
den of geek 's jack kibble @-@ white found the episode to be a surprise series highlight
however the episode attracted heavy criticism
in a review titled too much crying not enough shagging io9 's charlie jane anders criticised the episode 's reliance on cheesy soap opera moments
her major criticisms also encompassed the nonsensical aspects of the plot and the depiction of torchwood as an incompetent team particularly in allowing gwen to progress with her wedding in the circumstance of her being pregnant
she felt that the episode had saving graces in a sequence which she felt acted as an homage to films dead alive and evil dead and the fact it made her believe that rhys and gwen care about each other
ian berriman of sfx magazine wrote that the episode was one of the weakest of the second series and was hampered by limp gags and thuddingly obvious characterisation
ign 's travis fickett rated the episode five out of ten and criticised it as flat out bad television
he felt the comedic style to be at odds with torchwood 's science fiction and horror storytelling and criticised some of the character moments as preposterous and insipid
airlock alpha 's alan stanley blair was more mixed stating that the episode feels like a lot of ideas have been thrown into a pot and mixed with all the torchwood goodness
he felt that the episode held together by luck more than skill but still provided a lot of laughs and some wild fun
den of geek 's andrew mickel felt that the episode exaggerated and stereotyped the welsh characters in the overall scenario parodying them collectively as the welshest people on television
he also criticised the focus on gwen and the ridiculousness of her plan to marry rhys despite her being pregnant
he felt however that the episode played out like a fun episode of buffy and that rhys continued to be gwen ’ s one redeeming feature praising the scenes between him and his mother
developed by 4j studios and published by microsoft game studios a decade after the original 's <year> release the remaster features several technical improvements including higher resolution textures and models a higher frame rate and a multiplayer mode that supports the xbox live online service
it was released for the xbox <num> video game console in march <year> through the xbox live arcade download service
the story of the game follows joanna dark an agent of the carrington institute organization as she attempts to stop a conspiracy by rival corporation datadyne
perfect dark was under development for nearly a year and its game engine was completely re @-@ written from scratch to support several xbox <num> features
therefore although the game plays exactly the same as the original the code and renderer is different
the game received generally favorable reviews
some critics considered the relatively unchanged game to be outdated but most agreed that the title was a solid revival of a classic
as of the end of <year> the game had sold nearly <num> @,@ <num> units
in the game 's campaign mode the player controls joanna dark through a series of nonlinear levels collected together into missions
each level requires the player to complete a certain number of objectives ranging from disguising oneself to hacking computers collecting objects and defeating enemies among others
players can carry an unlimited number of weapons and almost all of the weapons have two firing modes
the levels in perfect dark have no checkpoints meaning that if joanna is killed or fails an objective the player has to start the level from the beginning
every level can be played on three difficulty settings and several aspects such as the enemies aggressiveness and the number of objectives that must be completed among others can vary in function of the chosen difficulty
two players can also play the campaign co @-@ operatively or through a counter @-@ operative mode in which one player controls the protagonist while the other controls enemies throughout the level attempting to stop the first player from completing objectives
the game also features a multiplayer mode called combat simulator where various players can compete against each other in different types of deathmatch and objective @-@ based games
aspects of each game can be highly customized
features such as the weapons available the winning condition and team management can be changed to match player preference
computer controlled bots called simulants can also be added to the game and each of them can be individually customized including their appearance difficulty and behavior
players can also issue orders to the simulants on their respective team for example guard tells a simulant to stay in its current location and guard that area
the player can explore the carrington institute which serves as the game 's training ground and take part in different training activities
the most substantial of these activities is the shooting range which allows the player to test all the weapons of the game against moving targets
the most remarkable change is that any of the multiplayer modes including co @-@ operative and counter @-@ operative can now be played in either splitscreen or through the xbox live online service
combat simulator matches are still capped at <num> entities but the game can now comprise eight players online simultaneously an improvement to the original 's cap of four players and eight simulants
players can also play against more than eight simulants as long as there are enough slots available in a match for example a single player can play against <num> simulants such a feature was not possible in the original game
unlike the original game all the multiplayer content is unlocked from the beginning and weapons from the game 's predecessor which were originally only available in the missions are now available to use in multiplayer
the game features an online leaderboard system and players can earn achievements and in @-@ game crowns by accomplishing certain tasks
the game also includes two new control set @-@ ups entitled spartan and duty calls which are based on the popular first @-@ person shooter franchises halo and call of duty respectively
on earth the megacorporation datadyne has developed in secret dr
caroll the world 's first sentient ai computer
feeling that datadyne has betrayed ethical and moral standards dr
caroll contacts the carrington institute an espionage agency founded by daniel carrington with the hope of revealing datadyne 's sinister dealings
he is recovered by joanna dark the institute 's top agent but is later recaptured by datadyne at carrington 's private villa
joanna is then sent to chicago to once again recover dr
caroll and uncover datadyne 's plan
she learns that datadyne and their conspirators plan to kidnap the president of the united states in order to get access to a deep sea vessel which will allow the conspirators to steal an alien megaweapon buried on the ocean floor
meanwhile joanna is ordered to rescue a maian survivor named elvis from area <num> who is key in stopping the conspiracy
she succeeds and the pair work together to rescue the president
she learns the conspirators are actually skedar aliens disguised as scandinavian humans who intend to test the weapon on the earth before using it against the maian homeworld
without permission from the president datadyne elect to hijack the deep sea vessel and take it to the ancient alien spacecraft
with the help of elvis joanna follows where she finds a reprogrammed dr
caroll decoding the megaweapon
she replaces its current personality with a backup of the original and the restored dr
carroll sets the weapon to self @-@ destruct in order to protect earth
in retaliation the skedar capture joanna and take her to their homeworld
elvis rescues her and she then kills the skedar high priest leaving the skedar in disarray
the game ends with elvis and joanna leaving the skedar planet just prior to an orbital bombardment from the maian navy
according to microsoft game studios creative director ken lobb the development team took the original code ported it to the xbox <num> and included deep xbox live integration
the game was developed over a course of approximately <num> months after the creation of a working prototype
as the xbox live functionality had to be written from scratch the developers opted to completely rewrite the game engine rather than do a port through emulation
as a result although the game plays exactly the same the code and renderer is different
the game also runs at 1080p and <num> frames per second
while the original level geometry was kept the levels received new textures characters and weapons were recreated and skyboxes were rebuilt
lobb explained that things are large and blocky because that 's what perfect dark looks like meaning that the sharper textures and higher resolution simply make the game look clearer
he also observed that as character and weapon models were remodeled from their original low hundreds polygon count to polygons in the thousands he was worried about them looking awkward in the low @-@ poly geometry level design
according to him it 's one of the areas that i give a lot of credit to the developer on
it just looks right
they were smart about the way they up @-@ resed the models so they still feel like they 're kind of retro but they 're clean
although music and sound effects were kept from the original recording sessions original master recordings have been used to update the soundtrack at much higher quality the original recording size was <num> mb while in the remaster it is over <num> mb
developers also decided to retain the free aim mode because they wanted to be faithful to the original game
according to rare 's producer nick ferguson we didn 't change the fundamental behavior of the aiming system simply because that is not how perfect dark was played
he also observed that the idea of updating the controls was actually seen as a flaw in perfect dark zero which tried to combine the original perfect dark system with aspects of halo
the original diagonal running which allows players to move faster than by running forwards or sideways alone did not work the first time they implemented the analog stick so it was manually rewritten as it was considered essential for speedruns and achieving some of the target times required to unlock cheats
it was confirmed to be in development on june <num> <year> via xbox live director of programming larry hryb 's twitter account
the game was released on march <num> <year> as part of microsoft 's xbox live block party promotion
as a cross @-@ promotion with the game crackdown <num> users can unlock that game 's protagonist known simply as agent <num> although a crackdown <num> savegame is required on the xbox <num> hard drive
a title update was released in april <year> which addressed bugs added two control schemes and expanded playlists
perfect dark was downloaded over <num> @,@ <num> times during its first week of release and grossed approximately <num>
<num> million at the end of the month
the game has sold more than <num> @,@ <num> units as of august <year> and nearly <num> @,@ <num> units at the end of <year>
as of year @-@ end <year> sales had increased to nearly <num> @,@ <num> units
in <year> the game was released as part of the rare replay compilation for xbox one
writing for 1up
com scott sharkey highlighted the technical improvements stating that the remaster is a great way to re @-@ enjoy a game you already love
daemon hatfield of ign noted the game 's outdated dialogue voice acting and mission objectives but nevertheless remarked that the game wasn 't brought back for the uninitiated -- this is for the fans and they will be very very happy
he also praised the game 's multiplayer mode over xbox live and highlighted the selection of weapons the satisfying gunplay and leaderboards noting that they allow players to compare their performance with their friends
despite the praise some reviewers criticized the game for its confusing level layouts and felt they have not held up very well over the years
christian donlan of eurogamer stated that perfect dark is not afraid to throw dead ends at you seemingly for the hell of it or repeat textures so much in its huge maps that you can get a little dizzy
gamespot 's tom mc shea noted that the campaign was oddly paced and that locked doors unused rooms and dead ends
can be disheartening to stumble around in a circle until you finally happen upon the correct door you just couldn 't locate
nevertheless he admitted that it 's a lot of fun to replay them to try for high scores and figure out the many unique objectives
he also remarked that that online play can periodically suffer from a significant amount of lag but praised the amount of content and features
the game 's original counter @-@ operative mode was very well received with eurogamer remarking that it still feels ahead of its time even now
dan ryckert of game informer stated similar pros saying that it 's even better this time around thanks to the framerate improvement
although the game 's controls have been upgraded to support two analog sticks steven hopper of gamezone noted that the game still feels a little different from what modern day shooter fans are used to while eurogamer remarked that the aim assist can be unnecessarily generous on easy difficulties
at the end of march <year> ign named perfect dark xbox live arcade game of the month
ostend was attacked in conjunction with the neighbouring harbour of zeebrugge on <num> april in order to block the vital strategic port of bruges situated <num> mi <num>
<num> nmi <num>
<num> km inland and ideally sited to conduct raiding operations on the british coastline and shipping lanes
bruges and its satellite ports were a vital part of the german plans in their war on allied commerce handelskrieg because bruges was close to the troopship lanes across the english channel and allowed much quicker access to the western approaches for the u @-@ boat fleet than their bases in germany
the plan of attack was for the british raiding force to sink two obsolete cruisers in the canal mouth at ostend and three at zeebrugge thus preventing raiding ships leaving bruges
the ostend canal was the smaller and narrower of the two channels giving access to bruges and so was considered a secondary target behind the zeebrugge raid
consequently fewer resources were provided to the force assaulting ostend
while the attack at zeebrugge garnered some limited success the assault on ostend was a complete failure
the german marines who defended the port had taken careful preparations and drove the british assault ships astray forcing the abortion of the operation at the final stage
three weeks after the failure of the operation a second attack was launched which proved more successful in sinking a blockship at the entrance to the canal but ultimately did not close off bruges completely
further plans to attack ostend came to nothing during the summer of <year> and the threat from bruges would not be finally stopped until the last days of the war when the town was liberated by allied land forces
bruges was situated <num> mi <num>
<num> nmi <num>
<num> km inland at the centre of a network of canals which emptied into the sea at the small coastal towns of zeebrugge and ostend
this land barrier protected bruges from bombardment by land or sea by all but the very largest calibre artillery and also secured it against raiding parties from the royal navy
capitalising on the natural advantages of the port the german navy constructed extensive training and repair facilities at bruges equipped to provide support for several flotillas of destroyers torpedo boats and u @-@ boats
by <year> these raiding forces were causing serious concern in the admiralty as the proximity of bruges to the british coast to the troopship lanes across the english channel and for the u @-@ boats to the western approaches the heaviest shipping lanes in the world at the time
in the late spring of <year> admiral reginald bacon had attempted without success to destroy the lock gates at ostend with monitors
this effort failed and bruges became increasingly important in the atlantic campaign which reached its height in <year>
by early <year> the admiralty was seeking ever more radical solutions to the problems raised by unrestricted submarine warfare including instructing the allied naval and marine forces department to plan attacks on u @-@ boat bases in belgium
the allied naval and marine forces was a newly formed department created with the purpose of conducting raids and operations along the coastline of german @-@ held territory
the organisation was able to command extensive resources from both the royal and french navies and was commanded by admiral roger keyes and his deputy commodore hubert lynes
keyes lynes and their staff began planning methods of neutralising bruges in late <year> and by april <year> were ready to put their plans into operation
zeebrugge was to be attacked by a large force consisting of three blockships and numerous supporting warships
ostend was faced by a similar but smaller force under immediate command of lynes
the plan was for two obsolete cruisers — hms sirius and brilliant — to be expended in blocking the canal which emptied at ostend
these ships would be stripped to essential fittings and their lower holds and ballast filled with rubble and concrete
this would make them ideal barriers to access if sunk in the correct channel at the correct angle
when the weather was right the force would cross the english channel in darkness and attack shortly after midnight to coincide with the zeebrugge raid a few miles up the coast
by coordinating their operations the assault forces would stretch the german defenders and hopefully gain the element of surprise
covering the inshore squadron would be heavy bombardment from an offshore squadron of monitors and destroyers as well as artillery support from royal marine artillery near ypres in allied @-@ held flanders
closer support would be offered by several flotillas of motor launches small torpedo boats and coastal motor boats which would lay smoke screens to obscure the advancing blockships as well as evacuate the crews of the cruisers after they had blocked the channel
the force was covered in the english channel by seven light cruisers and <num> destroyers none of which saw action
the ostend force arrived off the port shortly before midnight and made final preparations the monitors took up position offshore and the small craft moved forward to begin laying smoke
covering the approach the monitors opened fire on german shore defences including the powerful tirpitz battery which carried <num> in <num> mm guns
as a long range artillery duel developed the cruisers began their advance towards the harbour mouth searching for the marker buoys which indicated the correct passage through the diverse sandbanks which made navigation difficult along the belgian coast
it was at this stage that the attack began to go seriously wrong
strong winds blowing off the land swept the smoke screen into the face of the advancing cruisers blinding their commanders who attempted to navigate by dead reckoning
the same wind disclosed the inshore squadron to the german defenders who immediately opened up a withering fire on the blockships
with their volunteer crews suffering heavy casualties the commanders increased speed despite the poor visibility and continued groping through the narrow channels inshore searching for the stroom bank buoy which directed shipping into the canal
commander alfred godsal led the assault in hms brilliant and it was he who stumbled into the most effective german counter @-@ measure first
as brilliant staggered through the murk the lookout spotted the buoy ahead and godsal headed directly for it coming under even heavier fire as he did so
passing the navigation marker at speed the cruiser was suddenly brought to a halt with a juddering lurch throwing men to the decks and sticking fast in deep mud well outside the harbour mouth
before warnings could be relayed to the sirius following up close behind she too passed the buoy and her captain lieutenant @-@ commander henry hardy was shocked to see brilliant dead ahead
with no time to maneuvere sirius ploughed into the port quarter of brilliant the blockships settling into the mud in a tangle of wreckage
artillery and long @-@ range machine gun fire continued to riddle the wrecks and the combined crews were ordered to evacuate as the officers set the scuttling charges which would sink the blockships in their current useless locations
as men scrambled down the side of the cruisers into coastal motor boats which would relay them to the offshore squadron destroyers moved closer to ostend to cover the retreat and the monitors continued their heavy fire
godsal was the last to leave picked up by launch ml276 commanded by lieutenant rowley bourke
with the main assault a complete failure the blockading forces returned to dover and dunkirk to assess the disaster
when the forces had reassembled and the commanders conferred the full facts of the failed operation were revealed
the german commander of ostend had been better prepared than his counterpart at zeebrugge and had recognised that without the navigation buoy no night attack on ostend could be successful without a strong familiarity with the port which none of the british navigators possessed
however rather than simply remove the buoy the german commander had ordered it moved <num> @,@ <num> yd <num> @,@ <num> m east of the canal mouth into the centre of a wide expanse of sandbanks acting as a fatal decoy for any assault force
the larger raiders could no longer leave the port but smaller ships including most submarines were still able to traverse via ostend
in addition within hours a narrow channel had also been carved through zeebrugge too although british intelligence did not realise this for several weeks
the defeat at ostend did not entirely dampen the exuberant british media and public reaction to zeebrugge but in the admiralty and particularly in the allied naval and marine forces the failure to completely neutralise bruges rankled
a second operation was planned for <num> may using the cruiser hms vindictive and proved more successful but ultimately it also failed to completely close off bruges
a third planned operation was never conducted as it rapidly became clear that the new channel carved at zeebrugge was enough to allow access for u @-@ boats thus calling for an even larger double assault which would stretch the resources of the allied naval and marine forces too far
british losses in the three futile attempts to close bruges cost over <num> casualties and the loss of several ships but bruges would remain an active raiding base for the german navy until october <year>

dot was first identified as a strong tropical storm southeast of hawaiʻi on august <num>
the storm was potentially a continuation of a previously unnamed tropical cyclone that was monitored west of the baja california peninsula from july <num> @-@ <num> but was never confirmed due to a lack of ship reports
dot was quick to intensify reaching hurricane intensity six hours after naming
by august <num> dot reached its peak intensity with maximum sustained winds reaching <num> mph <num> km h
intensity leveled off afterwards as dot tracked westward before making a curve towards the northwest on august <num> after which the hurricane weakened at a faster clip
dot made landfall the next day on kauai as a minimal hurricane before dissipating west of the hawaiian islands on august <num>
dot produced heavy rainfall and gusty winds as it passed south of the big island lanai maui molokai and oahu resulting in minor damage
in oahu some homes along the coast were unroofed and damage from wave action was also reported
damage from these four islands totaled us <num> @,@ <num> and two indirect deaths occurred in lanai
extensive damage occurred on kauai as dot made landfall producing wind gusts as high as <num> mph <num> km h and toppling trees and power lines
widespread power outages affected the island causing telecommunications and water systems to fail
although infrastructure was damaged to an extent by floodwater and strong winds crops suffered the most losses
cane sugar crops sustained us <num>
<num> million in losses
overall damage from dot across hawaii totaled us <num> million and a disaster area declaration and state of emergency took effect for the archipelago after the hurricane 's passage
despite reports that the location of the system remained vague the joint typhoon warning center jtwc began issuing tropical cyclone advisories and warnings on the unnamed disturbance
tracking west @-@ northwestward the tropical storm peaked with winds reported at <num> mph <num> km h shortly after its discovery however the jtwc discontinued its monitoring of the cyclone on july <num> due to a lack of ship reports confirming the location of the tropical storm
at <year> utc on august <num> an unidentified ship roughly <num> mi <num> @,@ <num> km southeast of hilo hawaii reported <num> mph <num> km h winds within a storm prompting the jtwc to initiate advisories on tropical storm dot
despite an apparent correlation between dot and the preceding unnamed tropical cyclone the lack of ship reports between july <num> and august <num> prevented the agency from confirming that the two systems were the same
nonetheless development upon designation was rapid as the system tracked westward with reports from the ss sonoma indicating that dot had intensified to hurricane strength by august <num>
rapid intensification continued and at <num> utc on august <num> reconnaissance aircraft found winds of <num> mph <num> km h and a minimum barometric pressure of <num> mbar hpa <num>
<num> inhg making dot a category <num> hurricane on the modern @-@ day saffir – simpson hurricane wind scale
later analysis indicated that these figures constituted the hurricane 's peak intensity
after peaking dot slightly weakened but maintained its category <num> status for more than two days during that time it boasted an unusually large eye spanning as much as <num> mi <num> km in diameter
late on august <num> a fourth reconnaissance flight into the storm found surface winds of <num> mph <num> km h but this reading was discounted on the basis that pressures were unusually high for a storm of that intensity
on august <num> dot passed <num> mi <num> km south of ka lae before the storm curved sharply towards the northwest late that day
a more definite weakening phase began after this point and during the night of august <num> dot made landfall on kauai with winds estimated at <num> mph <num> km h making the storm a category <num> @-@ equivalent at the time of landfall
after traversing the island dot was downgraded to tropical storm intensity and curved back to the west before eventually dissipating on august <num>
as dot swept by the hawaiian islands various gale warnings and small craft warnings shifted westward to reflect the hurricane 's predicted path
due to the storm 's sudden northward shift in movement hurricane warnings were issued for portions of oahu and the kauai channel before being issued for only the island of kauai
all watches and warnings were discontinued on august <num> after dot weakened below hurricane intensity
disaster workers in oahu and kauai were warned by civil defense agencies and the american red cross to prepare for emergency
roughly <num> people fled from the beaches of kauai due to the threat of storm surge with an additional <num> people being evacuated by authorities as the storm neared the island
after the storm caused flooding in kauai nearly <num> @,@ <num> people evacuated out of submerged areas into schools armories and public facilities repurposed as emergency shelters
passing well to the south of the big island lanai maui molokai and oahu damage from dot on these islands was minor
rainfall on the big island peaking at <num> in <num> mm caused localized flooding in some areas while wave damage occurred at ka lae and along the island 's kona coast
winds at a station on ka lae reached <num> mph <num> km h
flooding also occurred on oahu and along the coast homes were unroofed and cars were damaged by flying projectiles after being subjected to winds estimated at <num> mph <num> km h
off of lanai a tugboat captain was indirectly killed after he slipped between two boats in rough seas while attempting to board another ship crushing him
another indirect death occurred on lanai in a traffic incident resulting from dot 's rainfall
damage on the hawaiian islands outside of kauai was estimated at <num> @,@ <num>
rough surf along the coasts of kauai combined with torrential rainfall to produce widespread coastal flooding
waves at port allen peaked at <num> ft <num>
<num> m
pineapple plantations were inundated with losses exceeding us <num> @,@ <num>
infrastructure damage as a result of wave action was spotty but nonetheless amounted to us <num> @,@ <num>
the august <year> rainfall total in lihue largely attributed to dot measured <num>
<num> in <num> mm <num> in <num> mm in excess of normal
the heavy rainfall caused rivers and streams to swell and inundate adjacent areas

allied intelligence believed the merville gun battery was composed of heavy @-@ calibre guns that could threaten the british landings at sword beach only <num> miles <num> km away
the <num> parachute battalion part of the <num> parachute brigade attached to <num> airborne division was given the objective of destroying the battery
however when the battalion arrived over normandy their parachute descent was dispersed over a large area so instead of over <num> men only <num> with no heavy weapons or equipment arrived at the battalion assembly point
regardless they pressed home their attack and succeeded in capturing the battery only to discover that the guns were of a lower caliber than expected czech @-@ manufacture <num>
however these still had the range over <num> metres to hit targets on sword beach and in ouistreham
using what explosives they had been able to recover the surviving <num> men tried to disable the guns
when the british paratroopers had withdrawn two of the guns were put back into action by the germans
another attack the next day by british commandos failed to recapture the battery which remained under german control until <num> august when the german army started to withdraw from the area
one of their objectives was the destruction of the merville gun battery
allied planners had judged from the size of the concrete gun emplacements that the guns must be around <num> mm in calibre
if so the guns would have a range of about <num> miles <num> km and could threaten sword beach to the west of ouistreham where the <num> british infantry division were due to land later that day
the battalion 's normal complement of <num> men was supported by a section of sappers from the royal engineers eight airspeed horsa glider loads transporting jeeps and trailers and stores including explosives an anti @-@ tank gun and flamethrowers
three of the gliders transporting <num> volunteers were to carry out a coup de main landing onto the position to coincide with the ground assault
in april <year> the force was taken to walbury hill in berkshire where over seven days the royal engineers had built a full @-@ scale replica of the battery including obstacles and barbed wire fences
the following five days were spent holding briefings and getting acquainted with the layout of the battery
they carried out nine practice assaults four of them at night
due to the nature of the mission the battalion was given additional medical support from no
<num> section <num> parachute field ambulance
another unit that would be present during the attack but not directly involved was a company of the 1st canadian parachute battalion
this company was tasked to provide covering fire for the <num> battalion 's approach to and withdrawal from the battery
the assault had to be completed and the battalion clear of the position by <num> <num> when the royal navy cruiser hms arethusa would open fire on the battery in an attempt to destroy it with naval gunfire
<num> m steel @-@ reinforced concrete gun casemates built by the todt organisation
each was designed to protect first world war @-@ vintage czech m
<num> <num> <num> mm guns
other buildings on the site included a command bunker a building to accommodate the men and ammunition magazines
during a visit on <num> march <year> to inspect the defences field marshal erwin rommel ordered the builders to work faster and by may <year> the last two casemates were completed
the battery was defended by a <num> mm anti @-@ aircraft gun and several machine guns in <num> gun positions all enclosed in an area <num> by <num> yards <num> by <num> m surrounded by two barbed wire obstacles <num> feet <num>
<num> m thick by <num> feet <num>
<num> m high which also acted as the exterior border for a <num> @-@ yard @-@ deep <num> m minefield
another obstacle was an anti @-@ tank ditch covering any approach from the nearby coast
the original commander of the battery hauptmann wolter was killed during a royal air force bombing raid on <num> may <year>
he was replaced by oberleutnant raimund steiner who commanded <num> engineers and <num> artillerymen from the 1st battery artillery regiment <year> part of the <num> static infantry division
the battery had a complement of some one hundred men in all
these were chiefly gunnery crews of course such as my team but also included staff officers and their assistants medical cooks observation teams maintenance teams and guards with side arms
it was intended that the battery could remain under siege for up to three months with sufficient rations and generator fuel kept on site for this event the water supply came from an aquifer and could not be interrupted
while some men remained to mark out the company positions the battalion 's second in command major george smith and a reconnaissance party left to scout the battery
at the same time royal air force lancaster bombers started their bombing run which completely missed the battery their bombs landing further to the south
the pathfinders in the meantime were having problems
those who had arrived at the correct drop zone found their eureka beacons had been damaged when they landed and in the smoke and debris left over from the bombing their marker lights could not be seen by the pilots of the transport aircraft
the main body of the <num> parachute battalion and their gliders were to land at drop zone v located between the battery and varaville from <num> <num>
however the battalion was scattered with a number of paratroopers landing a considerable distance from the designated drop zone
lieutenant colonel otway landed with the rest of his stick <num> yards <num> m away from the drop zone at a farmhouse being used as a command post by a german battalion after a brief fire @-@ fight they helped other scattered paratroopers and reached the drop zone at <num> <num>
by <num> <num> only <num> men had arrived at the battalion 's assembly point with <num> bangalore torpedoes and a machine gun
the mortars anti @-@ tank gun mine detectors jeeps sappers and field ambulance section were all missing
aware of the time constraints otway decided he could wait no longer and the reduced battalion headed for the battery and joined up with major smith 's reconnaissance party just outside the village of gonneville en auge
the reconnaissance party had cut a way through the barbed wire and marked four routes through the minefield
otway divided his men into four assault groups and settled down to await the arrival of the three gliders
in england one of the gliders never left the ground as its tow rope had snapped on taxiing
the other two gliders unable to locate the battery did not land where expected
on their run in both gliders were hit by anti @-@ aircraft fire
one landed around <num> miles <num>
<num> km away the other at the edge of the minefield
the troops from this glider became involved in a fire fight with german troops heading to reinforce the battery garrison
otway launched the assault as soon as the first glider overshot the battery ordering the explosives to be detonated to form two paths through the outer perimeter through which the paratroopers attacked
the defenders were alerted by the explosions and opened fire inflicting heavy casualties only four attackers survived to reach casemate four which they disabled by firing into apertures and throwing grenades into air vents
the other casemates were cleared with fragmentation and white phosphorus grenades as the crews had neglected to lock the doors leading into the battery
during the bombing raid the battery 's guns had been moved inside the casemates and the steel doors left open for ventilation
during the battle <num> germans were killed and a similar number made prisoners of war
the rest of the garrison escaped undetected by hiding in the underground bunkers
steiner was not present during the bombing but at a command bunker in franceville @-@ plage
after the raid he set out for the battery but was unable to gain entry due to the volume of fire from the british paratroopers
at the same time a reconnaissance patrol from an army flak unit with a half @-@ track mounting a large anti @-@ aircraft gun arrived
the crew had intended to seek cover at the position but instead used the gun to engage the paratroopers
with the battery in their hands but no sappers or explosives the british gathered together what plastic explosives they had been issued for use with their gammon bombs to try to destroy the guns
by this time steiner had returned to franceville @-@ plage and directed his regiment 's <num> and <num> batteries to fire onto the merville battery
the battalion being too weak only managed to liberate around half of the village and had to await the arrival of the 1st commando brigade later in the day to complete its capture
after the british had withdrawn the germans reoccupied the battery position
steiner was unable to see sword beach from his command bunker so even though he was able to get two of his guns back in action he was unable to direct accurate fire onto the landings
however observers with the <num> infantry regiment holding out at la brèche were able to direct his guns until that position was neutralised
on <num> june the battery was assaulted again by two troops of commandos from no
<num> commando part of the 1st special service brigade
the attack in daylight was repulsed with heavy losses to the commandos
as they withdrew they were engaged by the battery 's guns firing over open sights
the british never succeeded in completely destroying the battery and it remained under german control until <num> august when the german army started to withdraw from france
<num> km from the county town llangefni
it was constructed in <year> to replace the previous medieval church in the village of llangaffo
the new building includes a number of monuments from the old church and has a spire which is a prominent local landmark
the churchyard has part of a stone cross dating from the <num> or <num> century and some gravestones from the <num> to <num> centuries
it is dedicated to st caffo a <num> @-@ century martyr who was killed in the vicinity
the church is still in use as part of the church in wales one of four churches in a combined parish
it is a grade ii listed building a designation given to buildings of special interest which warrant every effort being made to preserve them in particular because it is regarded as a mid <num> @-@ century rural church consistently articulated and detailed in an early english style
<num> km south of the county town of llangefni is uncertain
the village takes its name from the church the welsh word llan originally meant enclosure and then church and -gaffo is a modified form of the saint 's name
st caffo a <num> @-@ century christian was a companion of st cybi and was martyred by shepherds in the vicinity of what is now llangaffo perhaps in revenge for his brother gildas insulting maelgwn gwynedd the local ruler
it is thought that there may have at one point been a monastery in this location known as merthyr caffo merthyr is the welsh word for martyr and in place names means a building erected near a saint 's grave
the present building which is in the north @-@ eastern part of the village on the south @-@ eastern side of the b4419 road was erected in <year> alongside the churchyard to a design by the sheffield @-@ based architects weightman and hadfield
it replaced an older church which had stood on an adjoining outcrop of rock until it was demolished
it was described by the clergyman and antiquarian harry longueville jones writing in <year> as the new church was being constructed as a very small and unimportant edifice he also noted that it was the only medieval building remaining in the parish
the <num> @-@ century church is still in use and belongs to the church in wales
it is one of four churches in the combined benefice of llanfihangel ysgeifiog st michael 's church gaerwen with llangristiolus st cristiolus 's church with llanffinan st ffinan 's church with llangaffo
it is within the deanery of malltraeth the archdeaconry of bangor and the diocese of bangor
as of <year> the vicar of the four churches is emlyn williams assisted by a curate e
r
roberts
williams was appointed in <year> before that the position had been vacant for <num> years despite many attempts by the church in wales to fill it
services in welsh are held every sunday either holy communion or morning prayer there are no midweek services
edward wynn <year> – <year> was rector here from <year> he later became chancellor of bangor cathedral and is buried at the church
james williams <year> – <year> was the son of john williams rector of st caffo 's
he succeeded his father when he resigned in <year> and later became chancellor of bangor cathedral
the roof is made of slate
the tower at the west end has buttresses at the corners and is topped with a broach spire which is a prominent local landmark
entrance is through an arched doorway in the north side of the tower
the chancel at the east end of the church is smaller than the nave in both height and width there is a transept on the north side of the chancel
the nave has lancet windows and there is a further lancet window on the south side of the chancel
the church 's east window is set in a pointed arch and has three lights sections of window separated by mullions
inside the church the sanctuary at the east end is raised above the chancel by one step the floor of the sanctuary and the reredos behind the altar are made from encaustic tiles
fittings include a circular decorated <num> @-@ century font and a <num> @-@ century pulpit with carved decorative panels
a <year> survey by the royal commission on ancient and historical monuments in wales and monmouthshire recorded that the church owned a silver cup and a paten dated <year>
the transept has a number of memorials dating from the <num> century including one to edward wynn and a stone from the early <num> century inscribed with
vi rnin filius cuuris cini ere xit hunc lapi dem
the stone which is set in the wall originally came from newborough anglesey
the church porch houses part of a cross head in the shape of a wheel dating from the <num> or <num> century part of the rest of the cross is in the churchyard but it has suffered significant weather damage with most of the patterns worn away
the oldest graves are to the north of the church which is unusual ordinarily the southern part of the churchyard would be used first for burials with the northern part remaining unconsecrated unless and until extra space for graves was required
the path between the road and the church has sunken which may partly be explained by the medieval custom of burying the dead on top of each other
one author has suggested that the mound alongside the path might indicate that the church is located in the site of a bronze age settlement
the churchyard has seven gravestones that were discovered in the walls of the previous church
six of them date from between the <num> and <num> centuries and the seventh is from the <num> or <num> century
the doorway from the old church dating from the <num> century has been reused as an entrance to the churchyard
a carved stone human head from the <num> century has been inserted into the north wall of the churchyard
a war memorial in the shape of a celtic cross remembers those who died during the first and second world wars
it was given this status on <num> january <year> and cadw the welsh assembly government body responsible for the built heritage of wales states that it has been listed because it is a mid <num> @-@ century rural church consistently articulated and detailed in an early english style
the <num> @-@ century writer samuel lewis said that the rebuilt church forms a very good specimen of the early english style of architecture adding that it was effective from its simplicity and the absence of pretension
he added that the interior had been fitted up in a neat and appropriate manner and the details throughout appear to have been carefully studied
a <year> guide to the churches of anglesey says that the impressive tower and steeple form a landmark visible for many miles
it also comments that rendering on part of the tower and the south wall makes them less attractive than the north wall
a <year> guide to the buildings of the region notes the exceptional number of inscribed fragments showing it to be a place of early christian worship but considers that the church is unlovely
similarly a <year> guide to wales describes st caffo 's as an uninspiring nineteenth @-@ century church from the outside but says that it has a remarkable collection of memorial stones
briggs george nixon briggs april <num> <year> – september <num> <year> was an american lawyer and politician from massachusetts
a whig briggs served for twelve years in the united states house of representatives and served seven one @-@ year terms as the <num> governor of massachusetts from <year> to <year>
raised in rural upstate new york briggs studied law in western massachusetts where his civic involvement and successful legal practice preceded statewide political activity
he was elected to congress in <year> where he supported the conservative whig agenda serving on the committee on the post office and post roads
he was also a regular advocate of temperance abstaining from all alcohol consumption
he was nominated by the whigs in <year> to run against democratic governor marcus morton as part of a whig bid for more rural votes and easily won election until <year>
although he sought to avoid the contentious issue of slavery he protested south carolina policy allowing the imprisonment of free african americans
he supported capital punishment notably refusing to commute the death sentence of john white webster for the murder of george parkman
briggs died of an accidental gunshot wound at his home in pittsfield massachusetts
he was the eleventh of twelve children of allen briggs a blacksmith originally from cranston rhode island and nancy brown briggs of huguenot descent
his parents moved the family to manchester vermont when he was seven and two years later to white creek new york
the household was religious his father was a baptist and his mother was a quaker and they gave their children religious instruction from the bible
at the age of <num> during the second great awakening which was especially strong in upstate new york briggs experienced a conversion experience and joined the baptist faith
he spoke at revival meetings of his experience drawing appreciative applause from the crowds according to hiland hall who came to know briggs at that time and who became a lifelong friend and political associate
his faith informed his personal behavior he remained committed to religious ideals for instance objecting to congressional sessions that stretched into sunday and abstaining from alcohol consumption
briggs sporadically attended the public schools in white creek and was apprenticed for three years to a quaker hatter
with support from his older brothers he embarked on the study of law in pittsfield and lanesboro in <year> and was admitted to the massachusetts bar in <year>
he first opened a practice in adams moved it to lanesboro in <year> and pittsfield in <year>
his trial work was characterized by a contemporary as clear brief and methodical even though he was fond of telling stories in less formal settings
in <year> briggs helped to establish a baptist church in lanesboro in this congregation he met harriet hall whom he married in <year> their children were harriet george and henry
briggs was also called upon to raise the four orphaned children of his brother rufus one of the brothers who supported him in his law studies
rufus died in <year> followed by his wife not long afterward
briggs involvement in civic life began at the local level
from <year> to <year> briggs was the register of deeds for the northern district of berkshire county massachusetts
he was elected town clerk in <year> was appointed chairman of the board of commissioners of highways in <year>
his interest in politics was sparked by his acquaintance with henry shaw who served in the united states house of representatives from <year> to <year>
a criminal case tried in <year> brought briggs wider notice
an oneida indian living in stockbridge was accused of murder
briggs was appointed by the court to defend him convinced by the evidence that the man was innocent briggs made what was described by a contemporary as a plea that was a model of jury eloquence
the jury unfortunately disagreed with briggs and convicted the man who was hanged
in <year> the true murderer confessed to commission of the crime
s
in <year> he decided to run for congress for which there was no such requirement
he was elected to the twenty @-@ second through the twenty @-@ fourth congresses as an anti @-@ jacksonian and as a whig to the twenty @-@ fifth through twenty @-@ seventh congresses serving from march <num> <year> to march <num> <year>
he decided not to run for reelection in <year>
briggs was what became known in later years as a cotton whig
he was in favor of protectionist tariffs and opposed the expansion of slavery into western territories but did not seek to threaten the unity of the nation with a strong stance against slavery
he served on the committee on public expenditures and the committee on the post office and post roads serving for a time as the chairman of each
the post office committee was a regular recipient of complaints from southern states concerning the transmission of abolitionist mailings which were seen there as incendiary the matter was of some controversy because southern legislators sought to have these types of mailings banned
briggs friend hiland hall who also sat on the committee drafted a report in <year> rebutting the rationales used in such legislative proposals but the committee as a whole and then the house refused to accept the report
although the authorship of the report appears to be entirely hall 's briggs may have contributed to it and was a signatory to hall 's publication of the report in the national intelligencer a major political journal
the document was influential in driving later congressional debate on legislative proposals concerning abolitionist mailings none of which were ever adopted
briggs and hall were both instrumental in drafting and gaining passage of the post office act of <year> which included substantive accounting reforms in the wake of financial mismanagement by postmaster general william taylor barry
during his time in congress briggs was a vocal advocate for temperance
he formed the congressional temperance society in <year> sitting on its executive committee at an <year> temperance convention at saratoga springs new york he advocated the taking of total abstinence pledges as a way to bring more people away from the evils of alcohol and notably prepared such a pledge for kentucky representative thomas f
marshall on the floor of the house of representatives
his moves to organize the temperance movement in congress died out when he left the body but it was a cause he would continue to espouse for the rest of his life
in <year> he was chosen president of the american temperance union
former governor john davis had been nominated first but refused the nomination possibly because daniel webster promised him party support for a future vice presidential bid
briggs was apparently recommended as a compromise candidate acceptable to different factions within the party one controlled by webster the other by abbott lawrence
he was also probably chosen to appeal more directly to the state 's rural voters a constituency that normally supported morton
the abolitionist liberty party also fielded a candidate with the result that none of the candidates won the needed majority
the legislature decided the election in those cases with a whig majority there briggs election was assured
briggs was reelected annually until <year> against a succession of democratic opponents
he won popular majorities until the <year> election even though third parties including the liberty party and its successor the free soil party were often involved
although whigs had a reputation for aristocratic bearing briggs was much more a man of the people than the preceding whig governors john davis and edward everett
in <year> briggs alarmed at a recently enacted policy by south carolina authorizing the imprisonment of free blacks arriving there from massachusetts and other northern states sent representatives to protest the policy
samuel hoar and his daughter elizabeth were unsuccessful in changing south carolina policy and after protests against what was perceived as yankee interference in southern affairs were advised to leave the state for their own safety
capital punishment was a major issue that was debated in the state during brigg 's tenure with social reformers calling for its abolition
briggs personally favored capital punishment but for political reasons called for moderation in its use seeking for example to limit its application in murder cases to those involving first degree murder
after an acquittal in an <year> murder case where anti @-@ death penalty sentiment was thought to have a role briggs seeking to undercut the anti @-@ death penalty lobby proposed eliminating the penalty for all crimes except murder but expressed concern that more such acquittals by sympathetic juries would undermine the connection between crime and punishment
briggs argument was used in the <year> trial of washington goode a black mariner accused of killing a rival for the affections of a lady
the case against goode was essentially circumstantial but the jury heeded the district attorney 's call for assertive punishment of crimes of violence and convicted him
there were calls for briggs to commute goode 's capital sentence but he refused writing a pardon here would tend toward the utter subversion of the law
not long after the goode case came the sensational trial of professor john white webster in the murder of george parkman a crime that took place at the harvard medical school in november <year>
the trial received nationwide coverage and the prosecution case was based on evidence that was either circumstantial complicated by the fact that a complete corpse was not found or founded on new types of evidence forensic dentistry was used for the first time in this trial
furthermore massachusetts supreme judicial court chief justice lemuel shaw was widely criticized for bias in the instructions he gave to the jury
briggs was petitioned to commute webster 's sentence by death penalty opponents and even threatened with physical harm if he did not
he refused however stating that the evidence in the case was clear especially after webster gave a confession and that there was no reason to doubt that the court had acted with due and proper diligence
during briggs time as governor abolitionist activists continued to make inroads against both the whigs and democrats primarily making common cause with the democrats against the dominant whigs
briggs stance as a cotton whig put him in opposition to these forces
he opposed the mexican @-@ american war but acceded to federal demands that the states assist in raising troops for the war earning the wrath of activist wendell phillips
he did promote other types of reform supporting horace mann in his activities to improve education in the state
in <year> briggs failed to secure a majority in the popular vote because of the rise in power of the free soil party but the whig legislature returned him to office
in the <year> election anger over the compromise of <year> a series of federal acts designed to preserve the unity of the nation which included the fugitive slave act prompted the democrats and free soilers to form a coalition to gain control over the massachusetts legislature and divided the whigs along pro- and antiabolition lines
with the gubernatorial election again sent to the legislature democrat george s
boutwell was chosen over briggs
he was a member of the state constitutional convention in <year> and sat as a judge of the court of common pleas from <year> to <year>
in <year> he was nominated for governor by the fading know @-@ nothing movement but trailed far behind other candidates
in <year> briggs was appointed by president abraham lincoln to a diplomatic mission to the south american republic of new granada roughly present @-@ day colombia and panama
however he died before he could take up the position
on september <num> <year> briggs was getting an overcoat out of his closet at his home in pittsfield when a gun fell
as briggs was picking it up the gun discharged and briggs was shot
briggs died early in the morning of september <num> <year> and was buried in the pittsfield cemetery
arriving in massachusetts on the winthrop fleet in <year> bradstreet was almost constantly involved in the politics of the colony but became its governor only in <year>
he served on diplomatic missions and as agent to the crown in london and also served as a commissioner to the new england confederation
he was politically comparatively moderate arguing minority positions in favor of freedom of speech and for accommodation of the demands of king charles ii following his restoration to the throne
bradstreet was married to anne the daughter of massachusetts co @-@ founder thomas dudley and new england 's first published poet
he was a businessman investing in land and shipping interests
due to his advanced age he died at <num> cotton mather referred to him as the nestor of new england
his descendants include the famous jurists oliver wendell holmes jr
and david souter
his father was the rector of the parish church and was descended from minor irish nobility
with his father a vocal nonconformist the young simon acquired his puritan religious views early in life
at the age of <num> bradstreet entered emmanuel college cambridge
he studied there for two years before entering the service of the earl of lincoln as an assistant to thomas dudley in <year>
there is some uncertainty about whether bradstreet returned to emmanuel college in <year> – <year>
according to venn a simon bradstreet attended emmanuel during this time receiving an m
a
degree but genealogist robert anderson is of the opinion that this was not the same individual
during one of bradstreet 's stints at emmanuel he was recommended by john preston as a tutor or governor to lord rich son of the earl of warwick
rich would have been <num> in <year> and preston was named emmanuel 's master in <year>
bradstreet took over dudley 's position when the latter moved temporarily to boston in <year>
on dudley 's return several years later bradstreet then briefly served as a steward to the dowager countess of warwick
in <year> he married dudley 's daughter anne when she was <num>
in <year> dudley and others from the earl of lincoln 's circle formed the massachusetts bay company with a view toward establishing a puritan colony in north america
bradstreet became involved with the company in <year> and in april <year> the bradstreets joined the dudleys and colonial governor john winthrop on the fleet of ships that carried them to massachusetts bay
there they founded boston the capital of the massachusetts bay colony
in <year> during the antinomian controversy he was one of the magistrates that sat at the trial of anne hutchinson and voted for her banishment from the colony
in <year> he was granted land in salem near that of john endecott
he lived there for a time moving in <year> to ipswich before becoming one of the founding settlers of andover in <year>
in <year> his andover home was destroyed by fire supposedly because of the carelessness of the maid
he had varied business interests speculating in land and investing with other colonists in a ship involved in the coasting trade
in <year> he purchased shares in the atherton company a land development company with interests in the narragansett country present @-@ day southern rhode island
he became one of its leading figures serving on the management committee and publishing handbills advertising its lands
when he died he owned more than <num> @,@ <num> acres <num> ha of land in five communities spread across the colony
he was known to own two slaves a woman named hannah and her daughter billah
bradstreet was heavily involved in colonial politics
when the council met for the first time in boston bradstreet was selected to serve as colonial secretary a post he would hold until <year>
he was politically moderate arguing against legislation and judicial decisions punishing people for speaking out against the governing magistrates
bradstreet was also outspoken in opposition to the witch hysteria that infested his home town of salem culminating in numerous trials in <year>
he served for many years as a commissioner representing massachusetts to the new england confederation an organization that coordinated matters of common interest principally defense among most of the new england colonies
he was regularly chosen as an assistant serving on the council that dominated the public affairs of the colony but did not reach higher office until <year> when he was first elected deputy governor under john leverett
he was against military actions against some of the colony 's foreign neighbors opposing official intervention in a french acadian dispute in the <num> and also spoke against attacking the new netherland during the first anglo @-@ dutch war <year> – <year>
bradstreet was sent on a number of diplomatic missions dealing with settlers other english colonies and the dutch in new amsterdam
in <year> he was sent to hartford connecticut where the treaty of hartford was negotiated to determine the boundary between the english colonies and new amsterdam
in the following years he negotiated an agreement with settlers in york and kittery to bring them under massachusetts jurisdiction
following the <year> restoration of charles ii to the throne of england colonial authorities again became concerned about preserving their charter rights
bradstreet in <year> headed a legislative committee to consider and debate such matters touching their patent rights and privileges and duty to his majesty as should to them seem proper
the letter the committee drafted reiterated the colony 's charter rights and also included declarations of allegiance and loyalty to the crown
bradstreet and john norton were chosen as agents to deliver the letter to london
charles renewed the charter but sent the agents back to massachusetts with a letter attaching conditions to his assent
the colony was expected among other things to expand religious tolerance to include the church of england and religious minorities like the quakers
the agents were harshly criticized by hardline factions of the legislature but bradstreet defended the need to accommodate the king 's wishes as the safest course to take
how to respond to the king 's demands divided the colony bradstreet was part of the moderate accommodationist faction arguing that the colony should obey the king 's wishes
this faction lost the debate to the hardline commonwealth faction who were in favor of aggressively maintaining the colony 's charter rights led through the <num> by governors john endecott and richard bellingham
with charles distracted by war with the dutch and domestic politics in the late <num> the issue lay dormant until the mid @-@ <num>
relations between colony and crown deteriorated when the king then renewed demands for legislative and religious reforms which hardline magistrates again resisted
leverett had opposed accommodation of the king 's demands and the change to an accommodationist leadership was too late
bradstreet would turn out to be the last governor under its original charter
his deputy thomas danforth was from the commonwealth faction
during his tenure crown agent edward randolph was in the colony attempting to enforce the navigation acts under which certain types of trade involving the colony were illegal
randolph 's enforcement attempts were vigorously resisted by both the merchant classes and sympathetic magistrates despite bradstreet 's attempts to accommodate randolph
juries frequently refused to condemn ships accused of violating the acts in one instance bradstreet tried three times to get a jury to change its verdict
randolph 's attempts to enforce the navigation laws eventually convinced the colony 's general court that it needed to create its own mechanisms for their enforcement
a bill to establish a naval office was vigorously debated in <year> with the house of deputies dominated by the commonwealth party opposing the idea and the moderate magistrates supporting it
the bill that finally passed was a victory for the commonwealth party making enforcement difficult and subject to reprisal lawsuits
bradstreet refused to actually implement the law and randolph published open challenges to it
bradstreet was in some degree vindicated when he won re @-@ election in <year> and he then used his judicial authority to further undermine the law 's effects
randolph 's threats to report the colonial legislature 's intransigence prompted it to dispatch agents to england to argue the colony 's case however their powers were limited
shortly after their arrival in late <year> the lords of trade issued an ultimatum to the colony either grant its agents wider powers including the ability to negotiate modifications to the charter or risk having the charter voided
the general court responded by issuing the agents instructions to take a hard line
following legal processes begun in <year> the charter was formally annulled on october <num> <year>
bradstreet 's brother @-@ in @-@ law joseph dudley who had served as one of the colonial agents was commissioned by james as president of the council for new england in <year> by king james ii and took control of the colony in may <year>
bradstreet was offered a position on dudley 's council but refused
dudley was replaced in december <year> by sir edmund andros who came to be greatly detested in massachusetts for vacating existing land titles and seizing congregational church properties for church of england religious services
andros high @-@ handed rule was also unpopular in the other colonies of the dominion
the idea of revolt against andros arose as early as january <year> before news of the december <year> glorious revolution reached boston
after william and mary took the throne increase mather and sir william phips massachusetts agents in london petitioned them and the lords of trade for restoration of the massachusetts charter
mather furthermore convinced the lords of trade to delay notifying andros of the revolution
he had already dispatched to bradstreet a letter containing news that a report prepared before the revolution stating that the charter had been illegally annulled and that the magistrates should prepare the minds of the people for a change
news of the revolution apparently reached some individuals as early as late march and bradstreet is one of several possible organizers of the mob that formed in boston in april <num> <year>
he along with other pre @-@ dominion magistrates and some members of andros council addressed an open letter to andros on that day calling for his surrender in order to quiet the mob
andros who had fled to the safety of castle island surrendered and was eventually returned to england after several months in confinement
in the wake of andros arrest a council of safety was formed with bradstreet as its president
the council drafted a letter to william and mary justifying the colony 's acts in language similar to that used by william in his proclamations when he invaded england
the council fairly quickly decided to revert to the government as it had been under the old charter
in this form bradstreet resumed the governorship and was annually re @-@ elected governor until <year>
he had to defend the colony against those who were opposed to the reintroduction of the old rule who he characterized in reports to london as malcontents and strangers stirring up trouble
the colony 's northern frontier was also engulfed in king william 's war where there was frequent indian raiding
bradstreet approved the expeditions of sir william phips in <year> against acadia and quebec
in <year> william and mary issued a charter establishing the province of massachusetts bay and appointed phips its first governor
bradstreet was offered a position on phips council when the new governor arrived in <year> but declined
bradstreet died at his home in salem on <num> march <year> at the age of <num> due to his advanced age he was called the nestor of new england by cotton mather
poetry by his first wife anne was published in england in <year> including verses containing expressions of enduring love for her husband
anne bradstreet died in <year> the couple had eight children of whom seven survived infancy
in <year> bradstreet married ann gardner the widow of captain joseph gardner son of thomas gardner of salem
his many descendants include jurists oliver wendell holmes jr

it is used within the pagan community under competing definitions
one refers to the entirety of the pagan witchcraft movement while the other refers explicitly to traditions included in what is now called british traditional wicca
although pronounced differently wicca is related to the old english word wicca which referred to sorcerers in anglo @-@ saxon england
in the early <num> english wiccan gerald gardner founder of the gardnerian tradition referred to the pagan witchcraft community as the wica
he claimed to have learned the term during his initiation into the new forest coven in <year>
by the late <num> gardner 's rival charles cardell founder of his own tradition had begun referring to the religion 's followers as wiccens and possibly used wicca in reference to the religion itself
the inclusive use of the term wicca — referring to the entirety of pagan witchcraft religion — has been traced to britain in the early <num> when it was used by various groups and publicised through use in adverts magazines and other literary sources
it was later adopted by figures like alex sanders and gavin and yvonne frost who took it to the united states
there practitioners of british traditional wicca adopted it exclusively for themselves as a means to differentiate their practices from those of other pagan witches
this exclusive meaning was countered by its popularisation as a generic term by prolific authors such as raymond buckland scott cunningham and silver ravenwolf
as it entered popular culture it gained an increasingly eclectic character in its usage
during the <num> some attempted to distance themselves from it by utilising the term traditional witchcraft
the first developed in england during the <num>
broad and inclusive it covers most if not all forms of modern pagan witchcraft especially if they share sufficient theological beliefs and ritual practices to be considered denominations within a common religious movement
in contrast the second developed in the united states during the late <num>
it refers specifically to the gardnerian tradition of witchcraft and those descended from it with little variation namely alexandrian and algard witchcraft which are together known as british traditional wicca
the majority of academics and independent scholars use the first more inclusive definition
given its historical status and prevalent usage within paganism pagan studies scholar ethan doyle white thought it the logical and easier choice for academia although there is still some disagreement and confusion among researchers as to what defines wicca
among those who have used the former definition are american sociologist margot adler literary scholar chas s
clifton and religious studies scholar aidan a
kelly while others such as the britons graham harvey and ronald hutton failed to make their usage clear
to deal with this problem in future doyle white urged scholars to specify which definition they used in their work
they are ancestral to modern english witch
the modern english term wicca took the old english wicca as its basis although the two are fundamentally two distinct words with differing meanings pronunciation and grammatical usage with nearly a millennium between their respective floruits
in <year> lewis spence writes in the weekly scotsman in response to the popularisation of margaret murray 's witch @-@ cult hypothesis in scotland that the saxon word wicca a witch was of immemorial usage in the scottish lowlands
doyle white suggests that the early wiccans adopted the term wicca as the basis for the name of their burgeoning faith because theirs was a new religious movement that took iconography and inspiration from the polytheistic cults of pre @-@ christian britain
he referred to the religion as the cult of witchcraft or the witch @-@ cult the latter likely being a term borrowed from margaret murray who wrote a book entitled the witch @-@ cult in western europe <year>
gardner did use the term wica which he always spelled with only one c in his writings but this did not refer to the religion itself instead referring to the religion 's practitioners in a plural sense
what are the witches then they are the people who call themselves the wica the wise people who practise the age ‑ old rites and who have along with much superstition and herbal knowledge preserved an occult teaching and working processes which they themselves think to be magic or witchcraft
in contrast with this plural use of the word in a <year> article written by arnold field a reporter for the daily dispatch gardner had apparently explained to him that there are man and woman witches
each is called a wica
this quote offers the only piece of evidence that gardner also referred to pagan witches individually as a wica
it is possible that field misunderstood what gardner was saying by not capitalising wica and that therefore gardner might have never used wica in a singular sense
in his book the meaning of witchcraft <year> gardner states that he first heard the term wica while being initiated into the new forest coven in september <year> stating that i realised i had stumbled on something interesting but i was half @-@ initiated before the word wica which they used hit me like a thunderbolt and i knew where i was and that the old religion still existed
this account was repeated in his biography gerald gardner witch <year> written by idries shah but attributed to jack l
bracelin in which he is quoted as saying that it was halfway through when the word wica was first mentioned and i knew that that which i had thought burnt out hundreds of years ago still survived
if gardner 's account was accurate and the new forest coven had really existed then the fact that gardner spelled the word as wica would not necessarily indicate that the coven members had spelled it the same way
as he relates from gardner 's account it seems that he had heard rather than read the word in the midst of his initiatory rite and that suffering from a poor grasp of spelling punctuation and grammar something caused by the fact that he was self @-@ educated and possibly also influenced by dyslexia he would have therefore spelled the word phonetically as wica
in the meaning of witchcraft gardner also notes the term wica 's resemblance to the old english word wicca stating that it is a curious fact that when the witches became english @-@ speaking they adopted their saxon name wica
in his published writings gardner propounds the idea that his pagan witchcraft religion dated back at least to the anglo @-@ saxon period when old english was the dominant language
wica soon became an accepted term among the early gardnerians as gardner 's followers and initiates became known
patricia and arnold crowther a gardnerian high priestess and high priest who operated a coven in sheffield use the term in their book the witches speak <year> writing that t he red queen told alice that she made words mean what she wanted them to mean
she might very well have been talking about witchcraft for today it is used to describe anything that one wishes to use it for
from the simple meaning the craft of the wica it is used in connection with black magic satanism black masses
a psychologist and stage conjurer cardell ran a company named dumblecott magick productions from his home in charlwood surrey from where he also controlled a local coven that was spied on by the press leading to a well @-@ publicised court case
having been involved with spiritualism as well as pagan witchcraft cardell initially befriended gardner but in <year> they had an argument and in <year> cardell tried to discredit him by publishing much of the then @-@ secret gardnerian book of shadows
cardell used the term wiccen to refer not just to members of his own tradition but to all followers of the pagan witchcraft religion placing an advert in light magazine the journal of the college of psychic science entitled the craft of the wiccens in <year>
the advert asked fellow wiccens to get in contact with him
this advert shows that cardell was responsible for the propagation and possibly invention of the term wiccen
it is possible cardell had also used the term wicca evidenced by the fact that margaret bruce the owner of a mail @-@ order business selling occult titles wrote a letter to her friend gerald gardner on <num> february <year> in which she consoled him on the attacks made against him by cardell and included a poem in which she referred to the wicca
in melissa seims opinion this use of wicca was explicitly in reference to the cardellian craft and therefore meant that this spelling along with wiccan was used by cardell
however it is also possible that bruce was referring to the wicca as a community of pagan witches in which case it would be a misspelling of gardner 's the wica
this etymological fact had been referred to five times in gerald gardner 's book the meaning of witchcraft <year> as well as in other early texts propagating pagan witchcraft such as doreen valiente 's where witchcraft lives <year> and justine glass witchcraft the sixth sense – and us <year>
none of these specifically referred to the pagan witchcraft religion as wicca
the earliest known published reference for the word wicca is within an advertisement published in a <year> issue of fate magazine in this a cardiff @-@ based group of pagan witches advertised a tradition as wicca – dianic and aradian
the advert may have been linked to charles and mary cardell because mary was allegedly born in wales and cardellian witchcraft had apparently venerated a goddess under the name of diana
however many pagan witchcraft groups would have adopted the deity name diana and aradia these being the goddesses featured in the american folklorist charles leland 's supposed account of a tuscan witch tradition aradia or the gospel of the witches <year>
another early use could be found from december <year> in the penultimate issue of pentagram the newsletter of the witchcraft research association
here a small column on halloween made reference to the craft of the wiccan apparently referring to the entire pagan witchcraft community
the author 's name was not printed although it had probably been produced by one of the figures involved in editing pentagram such as gerard noel or doreen valiente
in july <year> a group of british gardnerians began publishing a magazine titled the wiccan while welshman gavin frost founded the church of wicca in the united states that same year
in the <num> the gardnerian initiate alex sanders founded his own tradition which became known as alexandrian wicca he used the terms wicca and the wicca in reference to the entire pagan witchcraft religion
one of sanders initiates stewart farrar describes wicca as the witches name for their craft in his book what witches do <year>
the widespread adoption of wicca in reference to pagan witchcraft would have brought benefits to its practitioners who were widely maligned and faced persecution for their practice of witchcraft an emotive term often associated with satanism that had negative connotations in the western imagination
doyle white argued that the practitioners presentation of themselves as wiccans rather than witches removed some of the social stigma that they faced
this was followed by raymond buckland 's the tree the complete book of saxon witchcraft in which he propagated his newly developed tradition of seax @-@ wica utilising wica as the name of the tradition he also referenced the wicca as the name of the religion as a whole
contrastingly during the <num> the term wicca was rejected by feminist pagan witchcraft groups in the united states in particular the dianic tradition the term does not appear in the early works of zsuzsanna budapest and starhawk although the latter would adopt it by the 21st century
this was part of a phenomenon that took place during the <num> and <num> as the term wicca became increasingly associated purely with gardnerianism and alexandrianism together known as british traditional wicca in north america rather than with other variants of pagan witchcraft
this was encouraged by elements within the gardnerian and alexandrian communities who wished to emphasise what they perceived as their special position within the pagan community
the word wicca first appeared in a book title in <year> as wicca the ancient way written by janus @-@ mithras nuit @-@ hilaria and mer @-@ amun and published in canada
it discussed a gardnerian @-@ based tradition
j
conway 's wicca the complete craft <year> raymond buckland 's wicca for life <year> and wicca for one <year> arin murphy @-@ hiscock 's solitary wicca for life <year> and ann @-@ marie gallagher 's the wicca bible <year>
it was also adopted by american novelist cate tiernan as the title of her series of young adult novels
the term wicca was employed in an increasingly eclectic manner by authors like ravenwolf who considered it to be a synonym for witchcraft
in turn it began to be adopted on a wider scale being popularised in india by ipsita roy chakraverti and being adopted by a french luciferian group le wicca française
becoming widely known in western popular culture it was utilised by the script writers of two popular american television shows buffy the vampire slayer and charmed the first episode of the latter was titled something wicca this way comes while the tenth was titled wicca envy
reacting against the increasingly inclusive use of the term were pagan witches who instead characterised their practices as forms of traditional witchcraft
many pagan witches who considered themselves to be traditional witches exhibited an us @-@ and @-@ them mentality against gardnerianism and allied traditions for whom they reserved the term wicca
doyle white suggests that they had done so in order to distance themselves from the increasing influence of the new age movement over the wiccan mainstream with its iconographical emphasis on white light instead embracing the traditional european view that associated witchcraft with darkness
historian ronald hutton states that he knew of three wiccan covens founded in the <num> who began to describe themselves as traditional witches in the <num>
he has been influential in popular music and culture for more than five decades
much of his most celebrated work dates from the <num> when his songs chronicled social unrest although dylan repudiated suggestions from journalists that he was a spokesman for his generation
nevertheless early songs such as blowin in the wind and the times they are a @-@ changin became anthems for the american civil rights and anti @-@ war movements
after he left his initial base in the american folk music revival his six @-@ minute single like a rolling stone altered the range of popular music in <year>
his mid @-@ <num> recordings backed by rock musicians reached the top end of the united states music charts while also attracting denunciation and criticism from others in the folk movement
dylan 's lyrics have incorporated various political social philosophical and literary influences
they defied existing pop music conventions and appealed to the burgeoning counterculture
initially inspired by the performances of little richard and the songwriting of woody guthrie robert johnson and hank williams dylan has amplified and personalized musical genres
his recording career spanning more than <num> years has explored the traditions in american song — from folk blues and country to gospel rock and roll and rockabilly to english scottish and irish folk music embracing even jazz and the great american songbook
dylan performs with guitar keyboards and harmonica
backed by a changing lineup of musicians he has toured steadily since the late <num> on what has been dubbed the never ending tour
his accomplishments as a recording artist and performer have been central to his career but songwriting is considered his greatest contribution
since <year> dylan has published six books of drawings and paintings and his work has been exhibited in major art galleries
as a musician dylan has sold more than <num> million records making him one of the best @-@ selling artists of all time
he has also received numerous awards including eleven grammy awards a golden globe award and an academy award
dylan has been inducted into the rock and roll hall of fame minnesota music hall of fame nashville songwriters hall of fame and songwriters hall of fame
the pulitzer prize jury in <year> awarded him a special citation for his profound impact on popular music and american culture marked by lyrical compositions of extraordinary poetic power
in may <year> dylan received the presidential medal of freedom from president barack obama
he has a younger brother david
dylan 's paternal grandparents zigman and anna zimmerman emigrated from odessa in the russian empire now ukraine to the united states following the anti @-@ semitic pogroms of <year>
his maternal grandparents ben and florence stone were lithuanian jews who arrived in the united states in <year>
in his autobiography chronicles volume one dylan wrote that his paternal grandmother 's maiden name was kirghiz and her family originated from kağızman district of kars province in northeastern turkey
dylan 's parents abram zimmerman and beatrice beatty stone were part of a small but close @-@ knit jewish community
they lived in duluth until robert was six when his father had polio and the family returned to his mother 's hometown hibbing where they lived for the rest of robert 's childhood
in his early years he listened to the radio — first to blues and country stations from shreveport louisiana and later when he was a teenager to rock and roll
he formed several bands while attending hibbing high school
in the golden chords he performed covers of songs by little richard and elvis presley
their performance of danny the juniors rock and roll is here to stay at their high school talent show was so loud that the principal cut the microphone
in <year> his high school yearbook carried the caption robert zimmerman to join little richard
the same year as elston gunnn sic he performed two dates with bobby vee playing piano and clapping
zimmerman moved to minneapolis in september <year> and enrolled at the university of minnesota
his focus on rock and roll gave way to american folk music
in <year> he said the thing about rock 'n'roll is that for me anyway it wasn 't enough
there were great catch @-@ phrases and driving pulse rhythms
but the songs weren 't serious or didn 't reflect life in a realistic way
i knew that when i got into folk music it was more of a serious type of thing
the songs are filled with more despair more sadness more triumph more faith in the supernatural much deeper feelings
he began to perform at the ten o 'clock scholar a coffeehouse a few blocks from campus and became involved in the dinkytown folk music circuit
during his dinkytown days zimmerman began introducing himself as bob dylan
in his memoir dylan acknowledged that he had been influenced by the poetry of dylan thomas
explaining his change of name in a <year> interview dylan remarked you 're born you know the wrong names wrong parents
i mean that happens
you call yourself what you want to call yourself
this is the land of the free
in january <year> he traveled to new york city to perform there and visit his musical idol woody guthrie who was seriously ill with huntington 's disease in greystone park psychiatric hospital
guthrie had been a revelation to dylan and influenced his early performances
describing guthrie 's impact he wrote the songs themselves had the infinite sweep of humanity in them
he was the true voice of the american spirit
i said to myself i was going to be guthrie 's greatest disciple
as well as visiting guthrie in hospital dylan befriended guthrie 's acolyte ramblin jack elliott
much of guthrie 's repertoire was channeled through elliott and dylan paid tribute to elliott in chronicles volume one
from february <year> dylan played at clubs around greenwich village
he befriended and picked up material from folk singers there including dave van ronk fred neil odetta the new lost city ramblers and irish musicians the clancy brothers and tommy makem
in september dylan gained public recognition when robert shelton wrote a review in the new york times of a show at gerde 's folk city
the same month dylan played harmonica on folk singer carolyn hester 's third album which brought his talents to the attention of the album 's producer john hammond
hammond signed dylan to columbia records in october
the performances on his first columbia album — bob dylan — in march <year> consisted of familiar folk blues and gospel with two original compositions
the album sold only <num> @,@ <num> in its first year just enough to break even
within columbia records some referred to the singer as hammond 's folly and suggested dropping his contract but hammond defended dylan and was supported by johnny cash
in march <year> dylan contributed harmonica and back @-@ up vocals to the album three kings and the queen accompanying victoria spivey and big joe williams on a recording for spivey records
while working for columbia dylan recorded under the pseudonym blind boy grunt for broadside a folk magazine and record label
dylan used the pseudonym bob landy to record as a piano player on the blues project a <year> anthology album by elektra records
as tedham porterhouse dylan played harmonica on ramblin jack elliott 's <year> album jack elliott
dylan made two important career moves in august <year> he legally changed his name to robert dylan and he signed a management contract with albert grossman
in june <year> dylan had signed an agreement with roy silver
in <year> grossman paid silver <num> @,@ <num> to become sole manager
grossman remained dylan 's manager until <year> and was notable for his sometimes confrontational personality and for protective loyalty
dylan said he was kind of like a colonel tom parker figure
you could smell him coming
tensions between grossman and john hammond led to hammond 's being replaced as producer of dylan 's second album by the young african @-@ american jazz producer tom wilson
dylan made his first trip to the united kingdom from december <year> to january <year>
he had been invited by tv director philip saville to appear in a drama madhouse on castle street which saville was directing for bbc television
at the end of the play dylan performed blowin in the wind one of its first public performances
the film recording of madhouse on castle street was destroyed by the bbc in <year>
while in london dylan performed at london folk clubs including the troubadour les cousins and bunjies
he also learned material from uk performers including martin carthy
by the time of dylan 's second album the freewheelin bob dylan in may <year> he had begun to make his name as a singer and a songwriter
many songs on this album were labeled protest songs inspired partly by guthrie and influenced by pete seeger 's passion for topical songs
oxford town for example was an account of james meredith 's ordeal as the first black student to risk enrollment at the university of mississippi
the first song on the freewheelin album blowin in the wind partly derived its melody from the traditional slave song no more auction block while its lyrics questioned the social and political status quo
the song was widely recorded by other artists and became a hit for peter paul and mary
another freewheelin song a hard rain 's a @-@ gonna fall was based on the folk ballad lord randall
with veiled references to an impending apocalypse the song gained more resonance when the cuban missile crisis developed a few weeks after dylan began performing it
like blowin in the wind a hard rain 's a @-@ gonna fall marked a new direction in songwriting blending a stream @-@ of @-@ consciousness imagist lyrical attack with traditional folk form
dylan 's topical songs enhanced his early reputation and he came to be seen as more than just a songwriter
janet maslin wrote of freewheelin these were the songs that established dylan as the voice of his generation — someone who implicitly understood how concerned young americans felt about nuclear disarmament and the growing movement for civil rights his mixture of moral authority and nonconformity was perhaps the most timely of his attributes
freewheelin also included love songs and surreal talking blues
humor was an important part of dylan 's persona and the range of material on the album impressed listeners including the beatles
george harrison said of the album we just played it just wore it out
the content of the song lyrics and just the attitude — it was incredibly original and wonderful
the rough edge of dylan 's singing was unsettling to some but an attraction to others
joyce carol oates wrote when we first heard this raw very young and seemingly untrained voice frankly nasal as if sandpaper could sing the effect was dramatic and electrifying
many early songs reached the public through more palatable versions by other performers such as joan baez who became dylan 's advocate as well as his lover

his newest direction was signaled by two lengthy songs the impressionistic chimes of freedom which sets social commentary against a metaphorical landscape in a style characterized by allen ginsberg as chains of flashing images and my back pages which attacks the simplistic and arch seriousness of his own earlier topical songs and seems to predict the backlash he was about to encounter from his former champions as he took a new direction

one version has it that the boos were from folk fans whom dylan had alienated by appearing unexpectedly with an electric guitar
murray lerner who filmed the performance said i absolutely think that they were booing dylan going electric
an alternative account claims audience members were upset by poor sound and a short set
this account is supported by kooper and one of the directors of the festival who reports his recording proves the only boos were in reaction to the mc 's announcement that there was only enough time for a short set
nevertheless dylan 's performance provoked a hostile response from the folk music establishment

initially modeling his writing style on the songs of woody guthrie the blues of robert johnson and what he termed the architectural forms of hank williams songs dylan added increasingly sophisticated lyrical techniques to the folk music of the early <num> infusing it with the intellectualism of classic literature and poetry
paul simon suggested that dylan 's early compositions virtually took over the folk genre dylan 's early songs were very rich
with strong melodies
blowin in the wind has a really strong melody
he so enlarged himself through the folk background that he incorporated it for a while
he defined the genre for a while
when dylan made his move from acoustic folk and blues music to a rock backing the mix became more complex
for many critics his greatest achievement was the cultural synthesis exemplified by his mid @-@ <num> trilogy of albums — bringing it all back home highway <num> revisited and blonde on blonde
in mike marqusee 's words between late <year> and the middle of <year> dylan created a body of work that remains unique
drawing on folk blues country r b rock 'n'roll gospel british beat symbolist modernist and beat poetry surrealism and dada advertising jargon and social commentary fellini and mad magazine he forged a coherent and original artistic voice and vision

new york times critic robert shelton described his early vocal style as a rusty voice suggesting guthrie 's old performances etched in gravel like dave van ronk 's
david bowie in his tribute song for bob dylan described dylan 's singing as a voice like sand and glue
his voice continued to develop as he began to work with rock 'n'roll backing bands critic michael gray described the sound of dylan 's vocal work on like a rolling stone as at once young and jeeringly cynical
as dylan 's voice aged during the <num> for some critics it became more expressive
christophe lebold writes in the journal oral tradition dylan 's more recent broken voice enables him to present a world view at the sonic surface of the songs — this voice carries us across the landscape of a broken fallen world
the anatomy of a broken world in everything is broken on the album oh mercy is but an example of how the thematic concern with all things broken is grounded in a concrete sonic reality
dylan is considered a seminal influence on several musical genres especially folk rock country rock and christian rock
as edna gundersen stated in usa today dylan 's musical dna has informed nearly every simple twist of pop since <year>

some critics have dissented from the view of dylan as a visionary figure in popular music
in his book awopbopaloobop alopbamboom nik cohn objected i can 't take the vision of dylan as seer as teenage messiah as everything else he 's been worshipped as
the way i see him he 's a minor talent with a major gift for self @-@ hype
australian critic jack marx credited dylan with changing the persona of the rock star what cannot be disputed is that dylan invented the arrogant faux @-@ cerebral posturing that has been the dominant style in rock since with everyone from mick jagger to eminem educating themselves from the dylan handbook
fellow musicians also presented dissenting views

mitchell 's comment led to discussions of dylan 's use of other people 's material both supporting and criticizing him
in <year> mitchell told the canadian broadcasting corporation cbc in an interview that her remarks in the los angeles times had been taken completely out of context and that the interviewer was a moron
mitchell added i like a lot of bob 's songs
musically he 's not very gifted
he 's borrowed his voice from old hillbillies
he 's got a lot of borrowed things
he 's not a great guitar player
he 's invented a character to deliver his songs
talking to mikal gilmore in rolling stone in <year> dylan responded to the allegation of plagiarism including his use of henry timrod 's verse in his album modern times by saying that it was part of the tradition
if dylan 's work in the <num> was seen as bringing intellectual ambition to popular music critics in the 21st century described him as a figure who had greatly expanded the folk culture from which he initially emerged
following the release of todd haynes dylan biopic i 'm not there j
hoberman wrote in his <year> village voice review elvis might never have been born but someone else would surely have brought the world rock n roll
no such logic accounts for bob dylan
no iron law of history demanded that a would @-@ be elvis from hibbing minnesota would swerve through the greenwich village folk revival to become the world 's first and greatest rock n roll beatnik bard and then — having achieved fame and adoration beyond reckoning — vanish into a folk tradition of his own making
prior to the june <year> sale of the original lyrics of like a rolling stone written on four sheets of hotel stationery by dylan in <year> richard austin of sotheby 's new york said before the release of like a rolling stone music charts were overrun with short and sweet love songs many clocking in at three minutes or less

the heroin that charlie is supposedly snorting is actually brown sugar
monaghan revealed this in an interview with stuff magazine in october <year> saying the heroin is brown sugar
you get some really sweet boogers
you have to be careful not to snort too much of it but it 's happened a few times
you just find dessert up your nose couple of hours later
according to monaghan drive shaft is similar to oasis in that charlie 's first album was kind of like oasis 's first album critically acclaimed didn 't sell big numbers but in the industry people gave it respect
j
j abrams and damon linelof told monaghan that if he wanted to write the song that would be charlie 's one hit wonder they would consider using it in the show
monaghan wrote a song called photos and plans with a friend abrams and lindelof liked the song but it did not make it into lost
the lyrics were inspired by an incident on the phil donahue show where matt reeves who was close friends with producers bryan burk and damon lindelof saw a female audience member yell out you all everybody acting like it 's the stupid people wearing expensive clothes
the producers had an inside joke where they would say this quotation to each other

myles mcnutt of the a
v
club gave the episode a b and shared his opinion that it is one of the more intensely metaphorical — and thus writerly — episodes of the series
the eponymous metaphor — delivered by locke — is one of the series ’ most blatant and the moth ’ s consistent reappearance in the episode calls a lot of attention to the construction of the narrative
ign staff rated the moth as the <num> best episode in all of lost explaining the moth of the episode 's title appears both as a metaphorical and physical symbol of the struggle to find strength within yourself as locke explains to charlie and to take charge of your own life without relying on anyone else to do it for you
in a review focusing solely on the moth chris carabott of ign gave the episode a <num> <num> writing that the episode does a great job of utilizing screen time for most the major characters on the show and that locke 's analogy of the moth in comparison to charlie 's situation perfectly encapsulates what many of the characters are going through on the island
in a ranking of all of lost 's episodes todd vanderwerff of the los angeles times placed the moth at number <num> complimenting monaghan and o 'quinn 's acting but criticizing the storyline for containing nonsensical drug abuse storytelling

the way we was doing it i had a horn section down there along with me
we had the whole room set up with candles some nice wine — it was a very good vibe

the album 's lead single and carey 's boldest attempt at recreating the ballads from the early years of her career was through the rain which was produced by carey and was described by one critic as the sort of self @-@ help ballad ms
carey was singing a decade ago
the songs on the album are a mixture of several genres
carey 's cover of bringin on the heartbreak was recorded using live instrumentation and was the album 's third single
it begins as a piano @-@ driven slow jam which is followed by a dramatic chord progression after the second chorus and carey 's precise and fluttery voice reaches incredible heights as it turns the power ballad into something more delicate
kelefa sanneh from the new york times called yours a delectable combination of breathy vocals and playful rhythms
barry walters from rolling stone wrote that on yours carey 's lead vocals blend into choruses of overdubbed mariah 's cooing overlapping phrases
circling these are choirs of more mariahs singing harmonies and countermelodies
topping it off are generous sprinklings of the singer 's patented birdcalls wails sighs and whispers
critics considered subtle invitation to be one of the album 's strongest songs because of its well executed jazz influence
the song begins with the sounds of people dining then introduces the strong bassline and drums
towards the end of the song carey belts out the climax
sarah rodman from the boston herald described it as fascinating and wrote it sounds as though carey is singing in falsetto while still in her chest voice
clown drew strong media attention and its lyrical content led critics to speculate that carey aimed it at rapper eminem who had publicly announced that he had had a relationship with carey
rodman said clown was languidly sinister with lyrics such as i should 've left it at i like your music too
you should never have intimated we were lovers when you know very well we never even touched each other
critics compared i only wanted with my all s instrumentation and structure of verse chorus and guitar solo
according to sal cinquemani from slant magazine carey makes vague allusions to her ex @-@ husband tommy mottola with the line wish i 'd stayed beneath my veil
the song uses latin @-@ inspired guitar instrumentation and wind sounds as an additional backbone to the melody and dripping water as its percussion
sunflowers for alfred roy one of the album 's most personal songs is named after carey 's father she makes direct reference to him and a moment they shared at his death bed
the song is backed with a simple piano accompaniment and carey recounts a visit with her father in his hospital room strange to feel that proud strong man grip tightly to my hand

stephen thomas erlewine from allmusic rated the album two out of five stars and criticized its production and the condition of carey 's voice
he wrote whenever she sings there 's a raspy whistle behind her thin voice and she strains to make notes throughout the record
her voice is damaged and there 's not a moment where it sounds strong or inviting
tom sinclair of entertainment weekly said she was in fine voice he wrote that through the rain sinks in its own sodden sentimentality as do by @-@ the @-@ numbers efforts like yours and i only wanted and added that clown is a moody number graced with mournful acoustic guitar and a gorgeously nuanced vocal while sunflowers for alfred roy is a short sweet song sung to a lovely piano accompaniment
he finished by saying that too much of charmbracelet is mired in middle @-@ of @-@ the @-@ road muck

kelefa sanneh from the new york times wrote that the album is generally pleasant although it 's not always exciting and a few of the collaborations go awry
he called carey 's voice invariably astonishing and said that she can hit high notes that barely sound human praised her versatility and wrote that she also knows how to make a hip @-@ hop hit by holding back and letting the beat shine
ethan browne of new york slated the album 's whimsical chimes and tinkling keyboards and wrote was charmbracelet recorded in a casio shop this instrument needs to be stopped
rating charmbracelet two out of five stars barry walters from rolling stone wrote that none of the songs were bold that the lack of hooks made the album weak and said carey needs bold songs that help her use the power and range for which she is famous
charmbracelet is like a stream of watercolors that bleed into a puddle of brown
sal cinquemani from slant magazine complimented carey 's mixture of pop and hip @-@ hop melodies and wrote though there 's nothing as immediate as fantasy or my all here charmbracelet is significantly less contrived than <year> 's rainbow and almost as creatively liberating as butterfly
british columnist angus batey writing for yahoo music uk called the songs on charmbracelet forgettable and wrote she used to take risks but charmbracelet is conservative unadventurous and uninspiring and while it 's understandable that simply to make another record marks a triumph of sorts it 's impossible to admire mariah to the degree that her talent ought to merit
john mulvey from nme criticized its content writing nominally charmbracelet is r b much like tony blair is nominally a socialist

promotion for through the rain began at the <year> nrj awards where carey performed wearing a long black skirt and denim blazer
three days before the album 's us release a one @-@ hour program titled mariah carey shining through the rain in which carey was interviewed and sang several songs from charmbracelet and her back catalog aired on mtv
carey addressed rumors of her breakdown and its cause and spoke about the album and its inspiration and conducted a question and answer session with fans
during the first month after the album 's release carey appeared on several television talk shows
she launched her promotional tour on today where she performed four songs at mall of america for a crowd of over <num> @,@ <num>
on december <num> carey traveled to brazil for south american promotion of charmbracelet appearing on the popular television program fantástico
she sang my all and performed through the rain and i only wanted wearing a long pink gown
on december <num> <year> carey appeared on the oprah winfrey show where she performed through the rain and my saving grace and gave a highly publicized interview about her hospitalization
before her breakdown carey had been booked for a private interview with abc 's barbara walters executive producer of the view following glitter 's release
instead of giving walters the full @-@ coverage interview following carey 's return to the public eye island decided oprah was more appropriate and changed the appearance
carey 's interview with matt lauer on dateline nbc aired the same evening
on december <num> carey performed i only wanted on the view after guest co @-@ hosting the program
one month later carey was one of the headlining performers at the <num> annual american music awards held on january <num> <year>
she performed through the rain alongside a live gospel choir and wore a long black evening gown
during the performance images of newspaper headlines reporting carey 's breakdown were projected on a large curtain behind her with one reading when you fall down you get back up
carey received a standing ovation
in mid @-@ february carey was the headline performer at the nba all @-@ star game which was michael jordan 's last game
she wore a long purple skin @-@ tight washington wizard 's dress and performed boy i need you my saving grace and hero which received a standing ovation and brought jordan to tears

she performed my saving grace and as at the american music awards images of newspaper headlines and inspirational photographs were projected onto a large screen
following the performance carey was awarded a lifetime achievement award for her contribution to music
towards the end of march charmbracelet was released in europe and carey appeared on several television programs to promotion the album
she performed the album 's leading two singles on the british music chart show top of the pops and a similar set on the graham norton show and fame academy
on the latter program carey was joined on stage by the show 's finalists who sang the climax on through the rain alongside her
as of <year> charmbracelet world tour an intimate evening with mariah carey was her most extensive tour lasting over eight months and performing sixty @-@ nine shows in venues worldwide
before tickets went on sale in the us venues were switched from large arenas to smaller more intimate theater shows
according to carey the change was made in order to give fans a more intimate show and something more broadway @-@ influenced
she said it 's much more intimate so you 'll feel like you had an experience
you experience a night with me
however while smaller productions were booked for the us leg of the tour carey performed at stadia and arenas in asia and europe and performed for a crowd of over <num> @,@ <num> in manila <num> @,@ <num> in malaysia and to over <num> @,@ <num> people in china

<year> or <year> was the husband of william shakespeare 's daughter judith shakespeare and a vintner and tobacconist in stratford @-@ upon @-@ avon
quiney held several municipal offices in the corporation of stratford @-@ upon @-@ avon the highest being chamberlain in <year> and <year> but was also fined for various minor offences
in <year> quiney married judith shakespeare
the marriage took place during a season when a special licence was required by the church and the couple had failed to obtain one leading to quiney 's brief excommunication
quiney was also summoned before the bawdy court fewer than two months after the wedding to answer charges of “ carnal copulation ” with a margaret wheeler who died in childbirth
scholars believe that as a result of these events william shakespeare altered his will to favour his other daughter susanna hall and excluded quiney from his inheritance
judith and thomas had three children shakespeare richard and thomas
shakespeare quiney died at six months of age and neither richard nor thomas lived past <num>
the death of judith 's last child led to legal wrangling over william shakespeare 's will that lasted until <year>
scholars speculate that thomas quiney may have died in <year> or <year> when the burial records are incomplete
he was the son of richard and elizabeth quiney
he had <num> siblings among them a richard quiney who was a grocer in london mary quiney who later married richard watts the vicar of harbury and elizabeth quiney who married william chandler
there is no record of thomas quiney 's attendance at the local school but he had sufficient education to write short passages in french run a business and hold several municipal offices in his life
he held the lease to a house known as “ atwood 's ” for the purpose of running a tavern and later traded houses with his brother @-@ in @-@ law william chandler for the larger house known as “ the cage ” where he set up his vintner 's shop in the upper half
he is recorded as selling wine to the corporation of stratford @-@ upon @-@ avon as late as <year>
he was a man of some education with knowledge of french and calligraphy
in signing his accounts for <year> and <year> as chamberlain he decorated them with a couplet in french from a romance by mellin de saint @-@ gelais
quiney writes “ bien heureux est celui qui pour devenir sage qui pour le mal d 'autrui fait son apprentissage ” but the original is “ heureux celui qui pour devenir sage du mal d 'autrui fait son apprentissage ”
the original translates into english as “ happy is he who to become wise serves his apprenticeship from other men 's troubles ” but quiney 's version “ … is ungrammatical and without sense ”
he was a well @-@ respected man in the borough and was elected a burgess and constable in stratford @-@ upon @-@ avon in <year>
in <year> and <year> he was acting chamberlain
in signing his accounts for <year> – <num> he did so with flourishes ” but the records show that the council voted them “ imperfect ”
quiney did not attend this meeting but he did attend the later meeting where the accounts were passed so they appear to have needed further explanation
quiney 's reputation was slightly spotted he was fined for swearing and for “ suffering townsmen to tipple in his house ” and was at one point in danger of prosecution for “ dispensing unwholesome and adulterated wine ”
the assistant vicar richard watts who later married quiney 's sister mary probably officiated
the wedding took place during the lenten season which was prohibited
in <year> lent started on <num> january septuagesima sunday and ended on <num> april the sunday after easter
the marriage therefore required a special licence issued by the bishop of worcester which the couple had failed to obtain
a walter wright of stratford was cited for marrying without either banns or licence so since quiney was only cited for marrying without the required licence it is presumed that they had posted banns in church
the infraction was a minor one apparently caused by the minister as three other couples were also wed that february
quiney was nevertheless summoned by walter nixon to appear before the consistory court in worcester
this same walter nixon was later involved in a star chamber case and was found guilty of forging signatures and taking bribes
quiney failed to appear by the required date
the register recorded the judgement which was excommunication on or about <num> march <year>
it is unknown if judith was also excommunicated but in any case the punishment did not last long
in november of the same year they were back in church for the baptism of their firstborn child
the marriage did not begin well quiney had recently impregnated another woman margaret wheeler who was to die in childbirth along with the child and was buried on <num> march <year>
on <num> march <year> quiney appeared before the bawdy court which dealt among other things with whoredom and uncleanliness
confessing in open court to carnal copulation with margaret wheeler he submitted himself for correction
he was sentenced to open penance in a white sheet according to custom before the congregation on three sundays
he also had to admit to his crime this time wearing ordinary clothes before the minister of bishopton in warwickshire
the first part of the sentence was remitted essentially letting him off with a five @-@ shilling fine to be given to the parish 's poor
since bishopton only had a chapel he was spared any public humiliation
judith owned her father 's cottage on chapel lane stratford while thomas had held since <year> the lease on a tavern called atwood 's on high street
the cottage later passed from judith to her sister as part of the settlement in their father 's will
in july <year> thomas swapped houses with his brother @-@ in @-@ law william chandler moving his vintner 's shop to the upper half of a house at the corner of high street and bridge street
known as the cage it is the house traditionally associated with judith quiney
in the <num> century the cage was for a time a wimpy restaurant before being turned into the stratford information office
the cage provides further insight into why shakespeare would not have trusted judith 's husband
around <year> quiney tried to sell the lease on the house but was prevented by his kinsmen
in <year> to protect the interests of judith and the children the lease was signed over to the trust of john hall susanna 's husband thomas nash the husband of judith 's niece and richard watts vicar of nearby harbury who was quiney 's brother @-@ in @-@ law and who had officiated at thomas and judith 's wedding
eventually in november <year> the lease to the cage ended up in the hands of thomas eldest brother richard quiney a grocer in london
he first summoned his lawyer francis collins in january <year>
on <num> march he made further alterations probably because he was dying and because of his concerns about quiney
in the first bequest of the will there had been a provision vnto my sonne in l aw but sonne in l aw was then struck out with judith 's name inserted in its stead
to this daughter he bequeathed £ <num> in discharge of her marriage porcion another £ <num> if she were to relinquish the chapel lane cottage and if she or any of her children were still alive at the end of three years following the date of the will a further £ <num> of which she was to receive the interest but not the principal
this money was explicitly denied to thomas quiney unless he were to bestow on judith lands of equal value
in a separate bequest judith was given my broad silver gilt bole
finally for the bulk of his estate which included his main house new place his two houses on henley street and various lands in and around stratford shakespeare had set up an entail
his estate was bequeathed in descending order of choice to the following <num> his daughter susanna hall <num> upon susanna 's death to the first sonne of her bodie lawfullie yssueing to the heires males of the bodie of the saied first sonne lawfullie yssueing <num> to susanna 's second son and his male heirs <num> to susanna 's third son and his male heirs <num> to susanna 's ffourth
ffyfth sixte seaventh sonnes and their male heirs <num> to elizabeth susanna and john hall 's firstborn and her male heirs <num> to judith and her male heirs or <num> to whatever heirs the law would normally recognise
this elaborate entail is usually taken to indicate that thomas quiney was not to be entrusted with shakespeare 's inheritance although some have speculated that it may simply indicate that susanna was the favoured child
shakespeare was named for his mother 's father
richard 's name was common among the quineys his other grandfather and an uncle were both named richard
shakespeare quiney died at six months of age
richard and thomas quiney were buried within a month of each other they were <num> and <num> years old respectively
the deaths of all of judith 's children brought on new legal consequences
the entail on her father 's inheritance led susanna along with her daughter and son @-@ in @-@ law to make a settlement by use of a rather elaborate legal device for the inheritance of her own branch of the family
legal wrangling continued for another thirteen years until <year>
it is speculated that he may have died in <year> or <year> when the parish burial records are incomplete
he certainly had a nephew in london who by this time held the lease to the cage
during a transit venus can be seen from earth as a small black disk moving across the face of the sun
the duration of such transits is usually measured in hours the transit of <year> lasted <num> hours and <num> minutes
a transit is similar to a solar eclipse by the moon
while the diameter of venus is more than <num> times that of the moon venus appears smaller and travels more slowly across the face of the sun because it is much farther away from earth
transits of venus are among the rarest of predictable astronomical phenomena
they occur in a pattern that generally repeats every <num> years with pairs of transits eight years apart separated by long gaps of <num>
<num> years and <num>
<num> years
the periodicity is a reflection of the fact that the orbital periods of earth and venus are close to <num> <num> and <num> <num> commensurabilities
the last transit of venus was on <num> and <num> june <year> and was the last venus transit of the 21st century the prior transit took place on <num> june <year>
the previous pair of transits were in december <year> and december <year>
the next transits of venus will be on <num> – <num> december <num> and <num> december <num>
venus transits are historically of great scientific importance as they were used to gain the first realistic estimates of the size of the solar system
observations of the <year> transit combined with the principle of parallax provided an estimate of the distance between the sun and the earth that was more accurate than any other up to that time
the <year> transit provided scientists with a number of other research opportunities particularly in the refinement of techniques to be used in the search for exoplanets
<num> ° relative to the earth 's usually appears to pass under or over the sun at inferior conjunction
a transit occurs when venus reaches conjunction with the sun at or near one of its nodes — the longitude where venus passes through the earth 's orbital plane the ecliptic — and appears to pass directly across the sun
although the inclination between these two orbital planes is only <num>
<num> ° venus can be as far as <num>
<num> ° from the sun when viewed from the earth at inferior conjunction
since the angular diameter of the sun is about half a degree venus may appear to pass above or below the sun by more than <num> solar diameters during an ordinary conjunction
sequences of transits usually repeat every <num> years
after this period of time venus and earth have returned to very nearly the same point in their respective orbits
during the earth 's <num> sidereal orbital periods which total <num>
<num> days venus completes <num> sidereal orbital periods of <num>
<num> days each equal to <num>
<num> earth days
this period of time corresponds to <num> synodic periods of venus
the pattern of <num>
<num> <num> <num>
<num> and <num> years is not the only pattern that is possible within the <num> @-@ year cycle because of the slight mismatch between the times when the earth and venus arrive at the point of conjunction
prior to <year> the pattern of transits was <num> <num>
<num> and <num>
<num> years and the eight inter @-@ transit gaps before the ad <num> transit were <num>
<num> years apart
the current pattern will continue until <num> when it will be replaced by a pattern of <num>
<num> <num>
<num> and <num> years
thus the <num> @-@ year cycle is relatively stable but the number of transits and their timing within the cycle will vary over time
since the <num> <num> earth venus commensurability is only approximate there are different sequences of transits occurring <num> years apart each extending for several thousand years which are eventually replaced by other sequences
for instance there is a series which ended in <num> bc and the series which includes <num> only started in ad <year>
the early greek astronomers called venus by two names — hesperus the evening star and phosphorus the morning star
pythagoras is credited with realizing they were the same planet
there is no evidence that any of these cultures knew of the transits
venus was important to ancient american civilizations in particular for the maya who called it noh ek the great star or xux ek the wasp star they embodied venus in the form of the god kukulkán also known as or related to gukumatz and quetzalcoatl in other parts of mexico
in the dresden codex the maya charted venus full cycle but despite their precise knowledge of its course there is no mention of a transit
however it has been proposed that frescoes found at mayapan may contain a pictorial representation of the <num> or <num> century transits
his methods were not sufficiently accurate to predict that the transit would not be visible in most of europe and as a consequence nobody was able to use his prediction to observe the phenomenon
the first recorded observation of a transit of venus was made by jeremiah horrocks from his home at carr house in much hoole near preston in england on <num> december <year> <num> november under the julian calendar then in use in england
his friend william crabtree also observed this transit from broughton near manchester
kepler had predicted transits in <year> and <year> and a near miss in <year>
horrocks corrected kepler 's calculation for the orbit of venus realized that transits of venus would occur in pairs <num> years apart and so predicted the transit of <year>
although he was uncertain of the exact time he calculated that the transit was to begin at approximately <num> <num>
horrocks focused the image of the sun through a simple telescope onto a piece of paper where the image could be safely observed
after observing for most of the day he was lucky to see the transit as clouds obscuring the sun cleared at about <num> <num> just half an hour before sunset
horrocks observations allowed him to make a well @-@ informed guess as to the size of venus as well as to make an estimate of the mean distance between the earth and the sun — the astronomical unit
he estimated that distance to be <num>
<num> million miles <num>
<num> gm <num>
<num> au – about two thirds of the actual distance of <num> million miles <num>
<num> million km but a more accurate figure than any suggested up to that time
the observations were not published until <year> well after horrocks 's death
aware of this a young edmond halley made observations of such a transit on <num> october o
s
<year> from saint helena but was disappointed to find that only richard towneley in burnley lancashire had made another accurate observation of the event whilst gallet at avignon simply recorded that it had occurred
halley was not satisfied that the resulting calculation of the solar parallax at <num> was accurate
in a paper published in <year> and a more refined one in <year> he proposed that more accurate calculations could be made using measurements of a transit of venus although the next such event was not due until <year>
halley died in <year> but in <year> numerous expeditions were made to various parts of the world so that precise observations of the transit could be made in order to make the calculations as described by halley — an early example of international scientific collaboration
this collaboration was however underpinned by competition the british for example being spurred to action only after they heard of french plans from joseph @-@ nicolas delisle
in an attempt to observe the first transit of the pair astronomers from britain austria and france traveled to destinations around the world including siberia norway newfoundland and madagascar
most managed to observe at least part of the transit but successful observations were made in particular by jeremiah dixon and charles mason at the cape of good hope
less successful at saint helena were nevil maskelyne and robert waddington although they put the voyage to good use by trialling the lunar @-@ distance method of finding longitude
the existence of an atmosphere on venus was concluded by mikhail lomonosov on the basis of his observation of the transit of venus of <year> from the imperial academy of sciences of st
petersburg
he used a two @-@ lens achromat refractor and a weak solar filter smoked glass and reported seeing a bump or bulge of light lomonosov 's arc off the solar disc as venus began to exit the sun
lomonosov attributed that effect to refraction of solar rays through an atmosphere he also reported the appearance of a sliver around the part of venus that had just entered the sun 's disk during the initial phase of transit
in <year> pasachoff and sheehan reported based on knowing what venus 's atmosphere would look like because of pasachoff and schneider 's observations of the <year> transit of venus that what lomonosov reported was not venus 's atmosphere
to make a decisive test a group of researchers carried out experimental reconstruction of lomonosov 's discovery of venusian atmosphere with antique refractors during the transit of venus on <num> – <num> june <year>
they observed the lomonosov 's arc and other aureole effects due to venus 's atmosphere and concluded that lomonosov 's telescope was fully adequate to the task of detecting the arc of light around venus off the sun 's disc during ingress or egress if proper experimental techniques as described by lomonosov in his <year> paper are employed
for the <year> transit scientists traveled to tahiti norway and locations in north america including canada new england and san josé del cabo baja california then under spanish control
the czech astronomer christian mayer was invited by catherine the great to observe the transit in saint petersburg with anders johan lexell while other members of russian academy of sciences went to eight other locations in the russian empire under the general coordination of stepan rumovsky
the hungarian astronomer maximilian hell and his assistant jános sajnovics traveled to vardø norway delegated by christian vii of denmark
william wales and joseph dymond made their observation in hudson bay canada for the royal society
observations were made by a number of groups in the british colonies in america
in philadelphia the american philosophical society erected three temporary observatories and appointed a committee of which david rittenhouse was the head
observations were made by a group led by dr
benjamin west in providence rhode island
and published in <year>
the results of the various observations in the american colonies were printed in the first volume of the american philosophical society 's transactions published in <year>
comparing the north american observations william smith published in <year> a best value of the solar parallax of <num>
<num> to <num>
<num> arc @-@ seconds which corresponds to an earth @-@ sun distance of <num> times the earth 's radius about <num> different from the correct value
observations were also made from tahiti by james cook and charles green at a location still known as point venus
this occurred on the first voyage of james cook after which cook explored new zealand and australia
this was one of five expeditions organised by the royal society and the astronomer royal nevil maskelyne
jean @-@ baptiste chappe d 'auteroche went to san josé del cabo in what was then new spain to observe the transit with two spanish astronomers vicente de doz and salvador de medina
for his trouble he died in an epidemic of yellow fever there shortly after completing his observations
only <num> of <num> in the entire party returned home alive
the unfortunate guillaume le gentil spent eight years travelling in an attempt to observe either of the transits
his unsuccessful journey led to him losing his wife and possessions and being declared dead his efforts became the basis of the play transit of venus by maureen hunter
under the influence of the royal society ruđer bošković travelled to istanbul but arrived too late
unfortunately it was impossible to time the exact moment of the start and end of the transit because of the phenomenon known as the black drop effect
this effect was long thought to be due to venus thick atmosphere and initially it was held to be the first real evidence that venus had an atmosphere
however recent studies demonstrate that it is an optical effect caused by the smearing of the image of venus by turbulence in the earth 's atmosphere or imperfections in the viewing apparatus
in <year> using the combined <year> and <year> transit data the french astronomer jérôme lalande calculated the astronomical unit to have a value of <num> million kilometers ± <num> million km
the precision was less than had been hoped for because of the black drop effect but still a considerable improvement on horrocks calculations
maximilian hell published the results of his expedition in <year> in copenhagen
based on the results of his own expedition and of wales and cook in <year> he presented another calculation of the astronomical unit <num>
<num> million kilometers
lalande queried the accuracy and authenticity of the hell expedition but later he retreated in an article of journal des sçavans in <year>
three expeditions — from germany the united kingdom and the united states — were sent to the kerguelen archipelago for the <year> observations
the american astronomer simon newcomb combined the data from the last four transits and he arrived at a value of about <num>
<num> million kilometers ± <num>
<num> million kilometers
modern techniques such as the use of radio telemetry from space probes and of radar measurements of the distances to planets and asteroids in the solar system have allowed a reasonably accurate value for the astronomical unit au to be calculated to a precision of about ± <num> meters
as a result the need for parallax calculations has been superseded
the participants observations allowed a calculation of the astronomical unit au of <num> <num> <num> km ± <num> <num> km which had only a <num>
<num> difference to the accepted value
there was a good deal of interest in the <year> transit as scientists attempted to measure the pattern of light dimming as venus blocked out some of the sun 's light in order to refine techniques that they hope to use in searching for extrasolar planets
current methods of looking for planets orbiting other stars only work for a few cases planets that are very large jupiter @-@ like not earth @-@ like whose gravity is strong enough to wobble the star sufficiently for us to detect changes in proper motion or doppler shift changes in radial velocity jupiter or neptune sized planets very close to their parent star whose transit causes changes in the luminosity of the star or planets which pass in front of background stars with the planet @-@ parent star separation comparable to the einstein ring and cause gravitational microlensing
measuring light intensity during the course of a transit as the planet blocks out some of the light is potentially much more sensitive and might be used to find smaller planets
however extremely precise measurement is needed for example the transit of venus causes the sun 's light to drop by a mere <num>
<num> magnitude and the dimming produced by small extrasolar planets will be similarly tiny
the <year> transit provided scientists numerous research opportunities as well in particular in regard to the study of exoplanets
research of the <year> venus transit includes measuring dips in a star 's brightness caused by a known planet transiting the sun will help astronomers find exoplanets
unlike the <year> venus transit the <year> transit occurred during an active phase of the <num> @-@ year activity cycle of the sun and it is likely to give astronomers practice in picking up a planet 's signal around a spotty variable star
measurements made of the apparent diameter of venus during the transit and comparison with its known diameter will give scientists an idea of how to estimate exoplanet sizes
observation made of the atmosphere of venus simultaneously from earth @-@ based telescopes and from the venus express gives scientists a better opportunity to understand the intermediate level of venus atmosphere than is possible from either viewpoint alone
this will provide new information about the climate of the planet
spectrographic data taken of the well @-@ known atmosphere of venus will be compared to studies of exoplanets whose atmospheres are thus far unknown
the hubble space telescope which cannot be pointed directly at the sun used the moon as a mirror to study the light that had passed through the atmosphere of venus in order to determine its composition
this will help to show whether a similar technique could be used to study exoplanets
currently transits occur only in june or december see table and the occurrence of these events slowly drifts becoming later in the year by about two days every <num> @-@ year cycle
transits usually occur in pairs on nearly the same date eight years apart
this is because the length of eight earth years is almost the same as <num> years on venus so every eight years the planets are in roughly the same relative positions
this approximate conjunction usually results in a pair of transits but it is not precise enough to produce a triplet since venus arrives <num> hours earlier each time
the last transit not to be part of a pair was in <num>
the next will be in <num> in <num> the second of the <num> <num> pair although venus will just miss the sun as seen from the earth 's equator a partial transit will be visible from some parts of the southern hemisphere
thus after <num> years the transits of venus returns
the <year> transit is a member of the <num> @-@ years cycle <num>
the <year> transit is a member of <num>
the <year> transit is a member of <num> and the <year> transit is a member of <num>
the <num> transit is a member of <num> and so on
however the ascending node december transits of the orbit of venus moves backwards after each <num> years so the transit of <num> is the last member of series <num> instead of series <num>
the descending node june transits moves forwards so the transit of <num> is the last member of <num>
from <num> till <num> @,@ <num> only about ten series at both nodes each are needed for all the transits of venus in this very long timespan because both nodes of the orbit of venus moves back and forward in time
over longer periods of time new series of transits will start and old series will end
unlike the saros series for lunar eclipses it is possible for a transit series to restart after a hiatus
the transit series also vary much more in length than the saros series
in this case it is possible that in some areas of the earth a full transit can be seen while in other regions there is only a partial transit no second or third contact
the last transit of this type was on <num> december <year> and the next such transit will occur on <num> december <num>
it is also possible that a transit of venus can be seen in some parts of the world as a partial transit while in others venus misses the sun
such a transit last occurred on <num> november <num> bc and the next transit of this type will occur on <num> december <num>
these effects occur due to parallax since the size of the earth affords different points of view with slightly different lines of sight to venus and the sun
it can be demonstrated by closing an eye and holding a finger in front of a smaller more distant object when you open the other eye and close the first the finger will no longer be in front of the object
the simultaneous occurrence of a transit of mercury and a transit of venus does occur but extremely infrequently
such an event last occurred on <num> september <num> @,@ <num> bc and will next occur on <num> july <num> @,@ <num> and again on <num> march <num> @,@ <num>
the simultaneous occurrence of a solar eclipse and a transit of venus is currently possible but very rare
the next solar eclipse occurring during a transit of venus will be on <num> april <num> @,@ <num>
the last time a solar eclipse occurred during a transit of venus was on <num> november <num> @,@ <num> bc
it could be noticed that the day after the venerean transit of <num> june <year> there was a total solar eclipse which was visible in northern america europe and northern asia
he was the son of a man named aralt and appears to have been a grandson of amlaíb cuarán king of northumbria and dublin
such a relationship would have meant that ímar was a member of the uí ímair and that he was a nephew of amlaíb cuarán 's son sitriuc mac amlaíb king of dublin a man driven from dublin by echmarcach mac ragnaill in <num>
ímar 's reign in dublin spanned at least eight years from <num> to <num>
although he began by seizing the kingship from echmarcach in <num> he eventually lost it to him in <num>
as king ímar is recorded to have overseen military operations throughout ireland and seems to have actively assisted the family of iago ab idwal ap meurig king of gwynedd overseas in wales
after echmarcach 's final expulsion from dublin <num> ímar may well have been reinstalled as king of dublin by diarmait mac maíl na mbó king of leinster
whatever the case ímar died in <num>
he may have been an ancestor or close kinsman of gofraid crobán king of dublin and the isles the progenitor of a family that ruled in the isles until the mid thirteenth century
if this identification is correct ímar 's paternal grandfather would have been amlaíb cuarán king of northumbria and dublin died <num> <num> and a paternal uncle of ímar would have been sitriuc mac amlaíb king of dublin died <num>
there is reason to suspect that the latter 's realm included mann by the second or third decade of the eleventh century
his reign in dublin was finally put to an end by echmarcach mac ragnaill died <num> <num> who drove sitriuc from the coastal town and claimed the kingship for himself
previously sitriuc seems to have been closely aligned with knútr sveinnsson died <num> ruler of the kingdoms of england denmark and norway
knútr 's apparent authority in the irish sea region coupled with sitriuc 's seemingly close connections with him could account for the remarkable security enjoyed by sitriuc during knútr 's reign
it is possible that echmarcach had been bound from taking action against sitriuc whilst knútr held power and that the confusion caused by the latter 's death in <num> enabled echmarcach to exploit the situation and seize control of the irish sea region
although there is no direct evidence that echmarcach controlled mann by this date sitriuc does not appear to have taken refuge on the island after his expulsion from dublin
this seems to suggest that the island was outside sitriuc 's possession and may indicate that mann had fallen into the hands of echmarcach sometime before
in fact it is possible that echmarcach used the island to launch his takeover of dublin
echmarcach 's hold on dublin was short @-@ lived as the annals of tigernach records that ímar replaced him as king of dublin in <num>
this annal @-@ entry has been interpreted to indicate that ímar drove echmarcach from the kingship
there is reason to suspect that þórfinnr sigurðarson earl of orkney died c
<num> extended his presence into the isles and the irish sea region at about this period
the evidence of þórfinnr 's power in the isles could suggest that he possessed an active interest in the ongoing struggle over the dublin kingship
in fact þórfinnr 's predatory operations in the irish sea region may have contributed to echmarcach 's loss of dublin in <num>
it is conceivable that ímar received some form of support from knútr 's son and successor in britain haraldr knútsson king of england died <num>
the latter was certainly in power when ímar replaced echmarcach and an association between ímar and haraldr could explain why the annals of ulster reports the latter 's death two years later
ímar 's reign lasted about eight years and one of his first royal acts appears to have been the invasion of rathlin island within the year
the fact that he proceeded to campaign in the north channel could indicate that echmarcach had held power in this region before his acquisition of mann and dublin
in <num> the annals of tigernach records that ímar penetrated into the domain of the uí fhíachrach arda sratha and killed their chief
the annal @-@ entry also indicates that ímar stormed the church of armagh and burned scrín pátraic the shrine of patrick in the attack
the following year he again invaded rathlin island and his subsequent slaughter of three hundred noblemen of the ulaid including a certain heir apparent named ragnall ua eochada is documented by the annals of clonmacnoise the annals of inisfallen the annals of tigernach and the annals of the four masters
this remarkable action may indicate that the dubliners and ulaid were battling for control of rathlin island
if so it could be evidence that ímar enjoyed the possession of mann by this date
the domain of the ulaid is certainly the closest irish territory to mann and the control of the manx fleet could account for the dubliner 's ability to challenge the ulaid
whatever the case within the year niall mac eochada king of ulaid died <num> is recorded to have attacked fine gall — dublin 's agriculturally @-@ rich northern hinterland — in what may have been a retaliatory raid
the following year the annals of tigernach states that echmarcach succeeded ímar
the annals of the four masters specifies that ímar was driven from the kingship by echmarcach who was then elected king by the dubliners
after this point in ímar 's life all that is known for certain is that he died in <num> as recorded by the annals of ulster and the annals of loch cé
nevertheless since these sources style ímar in gaelic rí gall king of the foreigners there may be evidence to suggest that when diarmait mac maíl na mbó king of leinster died <num> drove echmarcach from dublin in <num> diarmait reinstalled ímar as king
after ímar 's death diarmait appears to have appointed his own son murchad died <num> control of dublin later that decade as the annals of the four masters accords him the title tigherna gall meaning lord of the foreigners in <num>
in <num> murchad invaded mann and seems to have overthrown echmarcach
both father and son were dead by <num> and the annals of tigernach describes diarmait on his death that year as king of the isles rí innsi gall literally king of the isles of the foreigners a declaration which seems to indicate that by the eleventh century at least the kingship of the isles was contingent upon control of mann
one of the latter 's main rivals was iago ab idwal ap meurig king of gwynedd died <num> a man who had killed gruffudd 's father in <num> and thenceforth ruled gwynedd until his own demise in <num>
gruffudd himself may have been responsible for iago 's slaying and certainly succeeded to the kingship of gwynedd after his death
it was likely in the context of iago 's fall and this resulting regime change that the latter 's son cynan fl
<num> fled overseas and sought refuge in dublin
according to historia gruffud vab kenan the mother of cynan 's son was ragnailt ingen amlaíb a paternal granddaughter of sitriuc
further revealed by this source is the fact that this woman 's father amlaíb mac sitriuc built and commanded a welsh fortress called castell avloed
although it is unknown how long the dubliners possessed the fortress in <num> another son of sitriuc was slain in wales by an apparent kinsman an event which could be evidence of a struggle for control of the site
echmarcach 's aforesaid expulsion of sitriuc from dublin in the same year could in turn indicate that this exiled monarch sought refuge in wales
despite the uncertainty of its specific location castell avloed appears to have been situated in territory formerly controlled by iago and there is reason to suspect that — after iago 's fall and cynan 's flight — ímar oversaw military actions against gruffudd
three years later for example brut y tywysogion and the b and c versions of annales cambriæ report that this welsh king was captured by forces from dublin
the episode is further elaborated upon by a sixteenth @-@ century text compiled by david powell died <year> and a seventeenth @-@ century text by compiled by james ware
according to these admittedly late versions of events gruffudd was captured by the dubliners in the context of them supporting the cause of cynan
the accounts further state that gruffudd managed to escape his captors when the dubliners were counterattacked by welsh forces before they could return to ireland
the evidence of cynan cooperating with the dubliners against gruffudd suggests that not only was ímar personally involved as king but that the welsh fortress of castell avloed was still controlled by the dubliners
another conflict that could have involved ímar and the military forces of dublin was gruffudd 's final defeat of hywel ab edwin king of deheubarth died <num>
according to brut y tywysogion and the b version of annales cambriæ this last stand of hywel took place at the mouth of the river tywi — perhaps in the vicinity of carmarthen — and included vikings from ireland who supported hywel 's cause
it is apparent that gruffudd 's adversaries generally utilised foreign military support from ireland 's viking enclaves
certainly the book of llandaff declares that gruffudd struggled against english irish and vikings during his career
in <num> the annals of tigernach reveals that gofraid possessed the kingship of dublin in an annal @-@ entry recording his patronym as
mac maic arailt
the chronicle of mann on the otherhand gives gofraid 's patronym as
filius haraldi nigri de ysland
whilst the former source identifies gofraid as the son of a man named aralt old norse haraldr the latter identifies gofraid as the paternal grandson of a man so named
in the aforesaid record of the military actions conducted in <num> ímar is merely named as the son of aralt a fact which could indicate that this was how he was known to his contemporaries
if correct the patronym preserved by the chronicle of mann could merely be a garbled form of this style
the patronym given by the chronicle of mann states that gofraid 's father was from ysland a place which could refer to either iceland islay or ireland
other than this passage there is no evidence hinting of a connection between gofraid and iceland
the chronicle elsewhere states that gofraid died on islay although the island 's name is rendered ile in this case
if ysland instead refers to ireland the spelling could be the result of influence from a source originating in england or a source written in mediaeval french
a mortal artist and sculptor tessa is the french lover of the protagonist immortal duncan macleod played by adrian paul
tessa is introduced in the pilot episode the gathering first shown in <year> and appears in all subsequent episodes until the darkness <year> the fourth episode of season two in which she is killed
vandernoot returned to the program for a number of guest appearances in the season two finale counterfeit broadcast in <year> and the two @-@ part series conclusion to be not to be <year>
tessa is macleod 's mortal companion and bears the consequences of his immortality
these include her aging while he does not the impossibility of having children together and the dangers of macleod 's involvement in the game an ongoing battle in which all immortals must behead each other until a single victor remains
fully aware of this situation tessa stays with macleod demonstrating her courage understanding generosity and compassion
the first series of highlander was a multi @-@ national co @-@ production including the french entertainment conglomerate gaumont which resulted in a french @-@ speaking actor playing tessa
vandernoot had to adapt to the north american fast @-@ paced method of series production and worked with a dialect coach
her performance was generally praised by reviewers who especially praised the strong on @-@ screen relationship that vandernoot and paul created between their characters
when vandernoot decided to leave the show her character was killed leading to fierce protests among the show 's audience and subsequently prompted the producers to have vandernoot play an evil lookalike of tessa in the episode counterfeit
despite her return tessa 's death influenced the rest of the series making it more pessimistic and creating a significant precedent tessa was the first main character of the series to die
after the character 's death she later returned for cameo appearances in the episodes counterfeit part two in the second season and to be and not to be the sixth season 's final two episodes
when she was seven years old she fell in love for the first time with then @-@ nineteen @-@ year @-@ old alan rothwood anthony head
tessa recalls in nowhere to run that she was heartbroken when he completed his studies and left the country
she remembered that at her first christmas party in the ballroom of alan 's house she couldn 't believe anything could be so beautiful
tessa mentions in see no evil that she was educated at the sorbonne in paris france
tessa 's first encounter with macleod is shown in a flashback sequence in for evil 's sake
she had recently left the sorbonne and was working as an artist and conducting tours of the river seine in paris
in may <year> to escape immortal christoph kuyler peter howitt who was trying to behead him macleod jumped on a bateau mouche on which tessa was working and charmed her so that he could stay on board
another flashback scene in the episode counterfeit part two shows how macleod revealed his immortality to tessa
on april <num> <year> macleod made tessa shoot him in the chest with a pistol
after he revived macleod revealed himself to be an immortal who could not age or father children but did not mention the game
macleod expected tessa to show disgust or fear but instead tessa expressed compassion and sadness for his loneliness
as tessa remains unaware of the game macleod occasionally fights other immortals without her knowledge
immortals slan quince richard moll and connor macleod christopher lambert break into their store making tessa aware of the game
when she learns of this ultimate battle of good and evil in which duncan macleod must behead or be beheaded she sarcastically remarks and you didn 't think it was important enough to mention
when quince threatens tessa to distract macleod she first wants to flee with macleod who prepared for her departure and beheads quince
aware that other immortals will challenge macleod tessa decides to stay with him
they also allow richie ryan stan kirsch a quick @-@ talking petty thief and street punk to live with them because he was aware of macleod 's immortality
in eyewitness <year> tessa witnesses the brutal murder of former artist anne wheeler diana barrington and reacts angrily when she realizes that the police will do nothing about it saying i 'm not hysterical i don 't see things and i 'm not looking for attention
i just want something to be done
she decides to find the murderer on her own
when macleod tells tessa that she is stronger than anne and that if something happened to him she would be fine tessa retorts you only think so because it suits you
the murderer is chief police officer andrew ballin tom butler who is beheaded by macleod after ballin failed to kill tessa
in band of brothers <year> tessa is chosen as the curator of a traveling exhibition entitled an historical retrospective on sculpture and form which is based in paris france
meanwhile immortal grayson james horan is seeking victor paulus a protegee of macleod 's friend darius werner stocker
tessa decides to leave to paris before macleod fights grayson and her parting words are remember
paris is our city
i 'll be waiting for you
after macleod beheads grayson he tessa and richie live in a barge on the seine near notre dame de paris
in avenging angel <year> macleod and tessa search for information about newborn immortal alfred cahill martin kemp
becoming immortal has made cahill insane he believes he is an angel sent by god to free the world from sin
cahill starts with the last prostitute he met tessa 's old friend elaine trent sandra nelson
tessa is angry to learn the fate of her intelligent beautiful friend but later realizes that she sounds like her judge and jury
macleod believes that the only way to stop cahill is to behead him despite tessa 's opinion that enlightened societies don 't kill their insane
they treat them
when cahill comes to the barge looking for macleod and finds tessa alone tessa diverts him by welcoming cahill as a messenger of god
later she tells macleod with disgust i had to crawl inside his head
i had to think like him
i had to become like him
in the darkness <year> tessa meets a fortune teller named greta traci lords who urges her to flee the city
this reminds macleod of another fortune teller who back in <year> predicted that he would bury many women but marries none
macleod impulsively asks tessa to marry him to which she agrees
the next day tessa is abducted by pallin wolf andrew jackson a renegade watcher who wants to behead macleod
in the meantime macleod tells richie that he is getting married because of the thought of losing tessa
tessa holds her ground in front of wolf and tries to escape but wolf brings her back to her cell
macleod finally finds them and kills wolf then sends tessa home with richie
on their way to the car tessa and richie are shot dead by marc roszca travis macdonald a drug addict wanting their money
richie 's previously unknown immortality is revealed when he returns to life on the spot but tessa dies
macleod devastated leaves their home and sells the antique store
eye for an eye <year> shows the aftermath of tessa 's death
macleod tells richie she was part of our lives richie
never pretend she wasn 't
macleod also advises richie to get used to her loss because it won 't be the last time it happens to you
later while macleod trains richie roughly so that he can face immortal annie devlin sheena easton richie angrily tells macleod you can 't get past it mac
i know
you 've seen a lot of people die
but you had to be the hero you sent us out to the car that night you could have been there
you look me in the eyes and you tell me you don 't blame yourself for her death
some time later macleod bitterly tells devlin nothing you do brings anyone back
once they 're dead
nothing
in the two @-@ part finale to series two counterfeit <year> james horton peter hudson a renegade watcher who believes all immortals must be eliminated uses killer lisa halle meilani paul to try and kill macleod
lisa undergoes plastic surgery to resemble tessa and therefore is played by vandernoot from that point on
macleod meets lisa just after he admitted to himself how much he missed tessa and he is stunned by her resemblance with tessa
despite knowing that tessa is dead and cannot return he eagerly pursues a relationship with lisa
he eventually admits the truth when he discovers a scar on lisa 's jaw
horton kills lisa on tessa 's grave before being himself killed by macleod
to be and not to be <year> the series finale respectively depict macleod dreaming of a world in which he was never born
vandernoot reprises her role as tessa this time never having met macleod
tessa leads an unsatisfactory life in which she has a husband and children but is forced to sacrifice her art and sculpture
in this storyline she has an affair with macleod but feels she has betrayed her husband
tessa and macleod are lovers and share deep feelings for each other
adrian paul commented that macleod spent twelve years with tessa without wanting another relationship and that
she was a very important part of his life
vandernoot thought that
the relationship between tessa and macleod was very deep because very soon he told her about himself
because he trusted her and i think trust is a very good definition of their relationship
she trusted him entirely and he trusted her
tessa is thus macleod 's only mortal lover who knows of his immortality
however executive producer bill panzer was intrigued by the idea that a mortal would want to spend their life with an immortal this choice having several drawbacks
macleod does not age while tessa is mortal and will age
despite their mutual wish they know growing old together is impossible and this uneasy thought
haunts them both sometimes more than others
as an immortal macleod is also sterile and tessa resigns herself to having no children
the sea witch deals with tessa 's choice and its impact upon her life
in this episode tessa becomes very fond of a four @-@ year @-@ old girl and muses for a while there just for a few hours
i felt like she was mine
i liked how it felt
but she 's not
i have my own life and it 's more than enough
panzer commented that the sea witch
brings forth in a very powerful way what exactly tessa s giving up to be with macleod
tessa occasionally meets macleod 's previous immortal lovers
in the lady and the tiger she immediately dislikes amanda played by elizabeth gracen and the script notes that
sparks fly between the two women
although she quickly earns amanda 's respect tessa feels like she has to compete with amanda while amanda comments that tessa is
quite refreshing in a gauche sort of way
gracen played amanda 's interaction with tessa ambiguously and a little flirtatiously
tessa is usually jealous of macleod 's past lovers but acknowledges in saving grace that
it would take me several lifetimes to find out everything in duncan 's past
i know there 've been others but i never thought i would meet one of them
in addition tessa shares with macleod the consequences of his involvement in the game
she dislikes the game and would like to escape from it with him since she fears for his life
according to vandernoot tessa
always thought that she would die before macleod but when he told her about the game during the gathering she realised that he could be killed thus she avoided thinking about it
another consequence of the game is that tessa is sometimes exposed to danger from immortals who want to use her to pressure macleod
despite being captured by quince in the gathering by the time of band of brothers she is able to face grayson if you think macleod will stand by
you have misjudged him terribly
so you 'd better kill me now and be done with it
grayson releases her and calls her
a remarkable woman well worth keeping alive
consequently tessa is fully aware of the risks of their relationship but stays with macleod explaining in eyewitness that i know the risks i choose to take
i stay with you because i want to
i won 't run
i 'm not the little woman and i 'll never be barefoot and pregnant
we all have things to face
this is mine
however she finds difficult to deal with her fears when macleod leaves to fight another immortal
very nice very understanding generous supportive
macleod appreciates that tessa always has a way of reminding him of his humanity
in for evil 's sake she tells a guilt @-@ ridden macleod that you may be immortal but you 're not omnipotent
the world is not your responsibility
tessa often jokes about macleod 's immortality for example telling him in for tomorrow we die that the last time macleod
wore a tuxedo was on the deck of the titanic
tessa is able to empathise with others feel as they do think as they do and so become like them
when macleod revealed his immortality to tessa in counterfeit part two she can show compassion instead of the fear or disgust he expects i was just thinking how lonely you must be
your parents your friends
having them all die
tessa is a very empathic and understanding character for example in saving grace she is jealous of macleod 's former lover grace however when macleod assures her that he no longer loves grace her response is simply that
that 's all that need to be said
she 's your friend and she 's been hurt
you 'll help her
i 'd expect you to do no less
furthermore tessa demonstrates great courage for example in mountain men where she is abducted by three mountain men led by immortal caleb cole who wants to marry her
tessa refuses to submit and spreads doubt among them resulting in cole finally killing one of his own men before macleod rescues her
reviewer rob lineberger of dvdverdict
com commented that
this episode shows the tough stuff tessa is made of
tessa is a very selfless character although it has occasionally been known to put her into rather sticky situations for example in the episode see no evil tessa 's friend natalie is attacked by serial killer michael tanovsky and tessa uses herself as bait nobody 's watching over his next victim duncan
and she 's going to die if you and i don 't stop him
lineberger commented that in see no evil tessa gets a taste for how duncan 's life must feel when she faces the killer
she hits tanovsky with her car telling macleod i thought ridding the world of evil would feel better than this
panzer comments that having tessa stop the killer
was kind of an unusual idea in television in <year> and this was the subject of a lot of meetings with then @-@ supervising producer david abramowitz myself and the people from the various networks domestic and foreign who were involved
tessa has a reputation for speaking frankly and for refusing to tolerate any nonsense
in innocent man when macleod refuses to take her where an evil immortal is she says i know why you don 't want me there
you 're afraid that what happened to lucas macleod 's friend who has just been beheaded could happen to you
tessa has no self @-@ pity and
doesn 't like euphemisms
for example in for tomorrow we die macleod calls her contrary by nature tessa parks her car without regard to interdictions can drive a speedboat is a poor chess player and dislikes war
she organises exhibitions of her works and sells a metallic sculpture to the city of seacouver to adorn a park
tessa is often seen making art works and welding large pieces of metal together drawing or using modelling clay
she is also seen sketching people with whom she has problems
tessa believes that
an artist should never grow complacent
change is good and fears the paris art critics because
they are the worst
a beautiful elegantly casual woman artist free spirit and proprietor of the most unusual antique shop in the city
the script of the episode saving grace says that she has grace and style
tessa is portrayed as a tall thin woman with blonde hair and blue eyes
because highlander the series was an international co @-@ production the producers cast a french @-@ speaking actor to play tessa
producer gary goodman explained that they wanted someone
that would be appealing on a television screen
in the sense that you were comfortable with her accent and her character
they chose belgian actress alexandra vandernoot because she
was able to be exotic pretty and not so unfamiliar to an american audience that she was accepted
vandernoot recalled i think i was quite close to tessa she was very well written very easy to play and i wish i was like that
i 'm not sure i 'd like that but
it 's very nice you know to play a character with nice feelings and nice emotions
vandernoot had to adapt to the north american way of filming series and learn to work fast
she said that filming the series was
exhausting but formative and that filming in english was challenging
vandernoot who is a native french speaker had a dialect coach
vandernoot and paul created a strong on @-@ screen relationship between their characters
david abramowitz creative consultant from the second season onwards said when i saw her and adrian together i thought that if i died and there was a mount olympus that the two of them would be standing together with thunderbolts around them
they were god @-@ like
they were so beautiful and had such presence
paul said that he was detached from the fictional relationship between tessa and macleod but that
it was a good relationship
later he said he
was sad to see it go
producer barry rosen said we were very lucky that vandernoot and kirsch were so human @-@ grounded so we could really play off of them and the way they looked at things that paul went through
they were also able to get into real @-@ life situations romances getting in trouble jealousies and so on
although vandernoot and kirsch are three years apart in age vandernoot being the older of the two on set vandernoot treated kirsch like a young boy while kirsch seemed to her like a younger brother because of his youthful appearance
vandernoot also wanted to spend more time with her family
according to abramowitz a further artistic reason was that
a small part of vandernoot being a really strong actress wanted to play a more aggressive part in the show and sadly the nature of the beast was that it couldn 't happen and she made a decision
panzer said that creating interesting female characters in the highlander franchise was often a challenge because the producers found it difficult to
have the women be something other than a victim a hostage other things when one is dealing with an immortal hero
consequently the creative staff needed to write tessa out of the show but were restricted because of the character 's strong relationship with macleod
associate creative consultant gillian horvath said that there was no way
to have a scene where she said okay i 'm going to go to paris without you
nice knowing you macleod
the writers decided that the only solution was for tessa to die despite abramowitz 's feeling that her death was
sad and
heartbreaking
tessa 's death occurs in the fourth episode of the second season the darkness
the creative staff decided tessa would die in a random carjacking incident
tessa 's death played no role in the episode 's main storyline
it was not formulaic the writers wanted to shock the audience
abramowitz said that
it would have been easier to kill her off in the episode but the writers
wanted it to be a surprise and show how shocking tessa 's death was to them
horvath said that
losing a loved one to a random act of violence isn 't something that only happens to television action heroes or immortals or people in another type of life it happens in the real world too- totally unexpectedly at a moment that makes no sense dramatically
tessa 's death scene shows macleod kneeling next to tessa and cuddling her then richie reviving and speaking with macleod
during the filming of the episode however no dialog was recorded
the final version of the episode shown in north america did not show richie revive
the european version showed richie reviving but no dialog was present
this scene was later re @-@ recorded in paris in <year> during the filming of the season finale counterfeit part two this time including the dialog
however this footage was not seen in the final version the footage was eventually used in the season four episode leader of the pack
highlander is a fantasy series yet i cared about the characters as though i know them
vandernoot gave tessa such vitality and charm that her death left me reeling
abramowitz said that tessa 's death strongly angered many viewers and that
people hated me for killing her
the audience became angrier still when in the following episode eye for an eye macleod made love to immortal annie devlin
abramowitz explained the creative decision of his staff by saying that
someone once told me that death was an aphrodisiac
it 's a thing that pushes you to life and the greatest thing in life that 's seize life is sex
lineberger wrote in his review of eye for an eye this one caused an uproar — one i feel is justified
abramowitz gave a defense in my opinion a weak one
i have a high tolerance for insensitive guy stuff but this got to me
when duncan rolled into annie 's arms part of me smirked in appreciation of duncan 's magnetic charm
but the rest of me found his actions cruel to the viewers
abramowitz confirmed that
the fans hated it
and the women wanted to string me up
i was a cad and a card
paul also reported an angry reaction from the audience after the seventh episode the return of amanda in which macleod sleeps with amanda
tessa 's death was a turning point in highlander the series
it marked the first time that a regular character died in the show it would be followed by the deaths of charlie desalvo and richie ryan
horvath recalled that
it changed the tone of the show
it made highlander the show where you couldn 't be positive that the characters were safe because they were in the credits
tessa 's death also gave the show a pessimistic tone that influenced the remaining characters
rosen explained that
in the years that followed without her and with kirsch 's character becoming immortal
you had to play the show differently
lineberger said that richie and duncan relate to each other differently from now on and duncan is bereft of much of his joy and moodier as well
tessa is no longer around to lighten him
according to kirsch vandernoot did not realize her or her character 's popularity before attending conventions
paul said that vandernoot was surprised that her character had so much influence on the show and that her return was
fun for her to do especially to play a different character which was similar to tessa but also had an evil intent to her
the counterfeit story features the character lisa undergoing plastic surgery to become tessa 's double
lisa was played by meilani paul before the surgery and by vandernoot after it
the producers wondered whether the story needed to explain the change in lisa 's voice as she would be played by a different actor
they considered suggesting that her voice changed because of the surgery then decided that lisa would have voice training
after her operation lisa speaks with vandernoot 's voice when posing as tessa and with meilani paul 's voice when the character was not acting
this was achieved using automated dialogue replacement during post @-@ production
adrian paul said that vandernoot portrayed lisa as a smoker to mark her out as a different character from tessa
paul also said that his lovemaking scene with vandernoot had to reflect the different relationship between macleod and lisa from that between macleod and tessa
according to paul lisa was more like a temptress to macleod than was tessa
according to panzer the original script featured horton sending lisa to kill macleod on the latter 's barge
after reading the draft script adrian paul thought the idea of lisa trying to kill macleod on tessa 's grave would have a more dramatic effect
rob lineberger called tessa
beautiful and spirited and said that
she is the perfect mortal foil for macleod 's heavy concerns
she lightens and strengthens him
reviewer abbie bernstein of the audio video revolution website wrote that tessa was
depicted not as a screechy in @-@ the @-@ dark lois lane but rather as a woman who handles her lover ’ s supernatural aspects with remarkable pragmatism
berstein added that tessa was estimable and
an unusually gutsy love interest not to mention a refreshing sexually active heroine as opposed to the coy sexual tension -generating females who usually populate the genre
other reviewers had a more negative opinion
reviewer gord lacey of tvshowsondvd
com
found it odd that everyone liked tessa because he found her rather annoying
reviewer doug anderson of the sydney morning herald wrote that tessa was
too arty and sympathetic to serve any purpose other than an emotional spur for the hero 's vengeance
reviewer david m
gutierrez also of dvdverdict
com noted the
strong on @-@ screen chemistry between tessa and macleod
so did lineberger one gets the feeling they have been together for years though the series is fresh out of the box and he added together they are a model couple
they have healthy banter intense arguments plenty of romance and an easy comfort with each other
bernstein wrote paul and vandernoot are charming separately and together
joanne ostrow of the denver post wrote that paul and vandernoot don 't look like typical american tv @-@ style bimbos and hunks and for good reason
they were cast to appeal internationally
discussing vandernoot 's performance lineberger called her a
gifted actor saying that
she has the poise restraint and grace to be both sensual and frustrated accomplished yet vulnerable mortal but aware of greater concerns
john goff of variety noted that vandernoot was attractive and anderson called her a
michelle pfeiffer look @-@ alike
reviewing the episode counterfeit gutierrez wrote that
despite the fact that the having an exact twin of tessa 's pop up is flatly ludicrous it plays out due to macleod 's desire to have tessa back overriding his sense of reason

vandernoot likes the tessa character quite a bit and gave me the impression she was sad to see her go and that she
looks like she enjoys playing the good bad lisa
her triple performance as tessa shows vandernoot 's range
kathie huddleston of scifi
com felt that
a visit from tessa in counterfeit even an evil tessa look @-@ alike is a welcome nod to a significant character from the first season and it gave our boy duncan a moment or two to reflect on his recent lost love
<num> @-@ mile @-@ long <num>
<num> km state trunkline highway in the metro detroit area of the us state of michigan
the highway runs through suburbs in oakland and wayne counties in addition to part of detroit itself
it starts in commerce township as a north – south divided highway and freeway called the haggerty connector and connects with interstate <num> i @-@ <num> in novi
the freeway then turns southeasterly to bypass the suburb of farmington as an east – west highway
the freeway ends on the southeast side of farmington and m @-@ <num> follows grand river avenue as boulevard into detroit
the eastern terminus is at an interchange with i @-@ <num> in detroit
the trunkline passes between suburban residential subdivisions and along urban commercial areas while serving <num> @,@ <num> – <num> @,@ <num> vehicles on average each day
grand river avenue started as the path of an early wagon trail in the michigan territory carrying settlers from detroit inland along a route previously used by native americans
it was later a plank road that helped to connect detroit with the state capital of lansing and grand rapids
when the state highway system was signed in <year> the avenue was numbered as part of m @-@ <num>
later it became us highway <num> us <num>
grand river avenue was supposed to be the path for i @-@ <num> from novi into downtown detroit and a section of freeway now used by m @-@ <num> was constructed as part of i @-@ <num> before the interstate was rerouted to a different location
in the <num> another section of freeway which was originally proposed for a northern extension of i @-@ <num> was opened
this freeway called the haggerty connector was added to m @-@ <num>
additional projects have extended the highway farther north and added a roundabout to the northern terminus
a different highway was previously designated m @-@ <num> in another area of the state in the <num>
it runs south @-@ southwesterly from here in oakland county as a divided highway between suburban residential subdivisions in the township
south of maple road the highway is bordered by commercial developments to the east and long park to the west as it angles southeasterly
between <num> and <num> mile roads the highway is once again bounded by subdivisions
along this part of the trunkline access to the road is limited to major intersections only making the highway an expressway
immediately south of the <num> mile road intersection m @-@ <num> 's median widens out as the highway transitions to a full freeway called the haggerty connector
traffic can only access the highway at grade @-@ separated interchanges instead of at @-@ grade intersections
a collector @-@ distributor lane setup parallels the main freeway lanes proving access to the ramps at the <num> mile road interchange as well as ramps from the massive interchange with i @-@ <num> i @-@ <num> and i @-@ <num>
through this interchange complex that straddles the novi – farmington hills city line m @-@ <num> turns to the southeast and signage changes direction
the haggerty connector is signed north – south while the rest of m @-@ <num> is signed east – west
m @-@ <num> has direct connections with ramps to i @-@ <num> and i @-@ <num> east i @-@ <num> south as it crosses over into farmington hills
the next interchange for the m @-@ <num> freeway connects to grand river avenue and <num> mile road
this section of the freeway bypasses residential areas of farmington hills
further east m @-@ <num> crosses into farmington where it bypasses the downtown area of the suburb
past <num> mile road the freeway ends at the intersection with grand river avenue and m @-@ <num> follows grand river southeasterly as a boulevard a type of divided street
traffic that wishes to make left turns must use a michigan left maneuver along this section of the highway
additionally traffic that needs to change sides of the street must use crossovers in the median to perform a u @-@ turn
once again running through suburban farmington hills the trunkline passes botsford hospital before intersecting <num> mile road
this intersection marks the place where m @-@ <num> crosses into wayne county and the western terminus of the m @-@ <num> designation on <num> mile road
grand river avenue runs through the northern section of redford township in wayne county and crosses into detroit at the intersection with <num> mile road and <num> points street
the northwest corner of detroit is mostly residential as m @-@ <num> intersects us <num> telegraph road
past telegraph grand river avenue forms the northern boundary of the grand lawn cemetery and later the southern boundary of the new rogell golf course
the properties bordering m @-@ <num> transition to commercial use past these two green spaces and the highway continues southeasterly through the city as an undivided street
grand river avenue intersects outer drive near several businesses
m @-@ <num> crosses over m @-@ <num> southfield freeway near the intersection with fenkell street which would be <num> mile road in the detroit grid system
the residential areas off the adjacent side streets increase in density east of the southfield freeway
m @-@ <num> ends at the interchange with i @-@ <num> between schoolcraft and plymouth roads in the middle of another larger commercial zone grand river avenue continues from this location as an unsigned highway numbered internally as old bs i @-@ <num> all the way into downtown
m @-@ <num> is maintained by the michigan department of transportation mdot like other state highways in michigan
as a part of these maintenance responsibilities the department tracks the volume of traffic that uses the roadways under its jurisdiction
these volumes are expressed using a metric called annual average daily traffic which is a statistical calculation of the average daily number of vehicles on a segment of roadway
mdot 's surveys in <year> showed that the highest traffic levels along m @-@ <num> were the <num> @,@ <num> vehicles daily between <num> and <num> mile roads the lowest counts were the <num> @,@ <num> vehicles per day southeast of schoolcraft road to i @-@ <num>
all of m @-@ <num> has been listed on the national highway system a network of roads important to the country 's economy defense and mobility
the trunkline is six- or eight @-@ lanes wide along the freeway section to the north and west of the grand river avenue interchange south and east of there it is a four @-@ lane freeway or six @-@ lane highway all the way to i @-@ <num>
this designation was in use until <year> when it was replaced by m @-@ <num>
detroit created <num> @-@ foot <num> m rights @-@ of @-@ way for the principal streets of the city grand river avenue included in <year>
this street plan was devised by augustus woodward and others following a devastating fire in detroit
a ten @-@ year project to construct a plank road between detroit and howell was authorized in <year> along the grand river trail
grand river avenue was included as one of five great military roads in <year> along with the river road michigan avenue woodward avenue and gratiot avenue
the grand river road precursor to the modern grand river avenue was named by benjamin williams cofounder of owosso it was named for la grande riviere the french name for the river
the opening of the erie canal in new york in <year> brought new settlers to the great lakes region and to the future state of michigan
many of these settlers began their inland journeys in detroit
at first the grand river road was a deep rutted ditch bordered road
the grand river road was a major route for settlers headed inland to grand rapids in <year> as the shortest route for travelers coming from detroit
in <year> the michigan state legislature established the lansing and howell plank road company which set about converting various indian trails into the lansing – howell plank road a task the company completed by <year>
at howell the road connected with the detroit – howell plank road establishing the first improved connection direct from the state capital to michigan 's largest metropolis
the lansing – detroit plank road was a toll road until the <num>
it eventually evolved into the eastern part of the modern grand river avenue
by <year> only a short stretch of the detroit – howell plank road was still make of planks most of the other plank roads had been converted to gravel by this time
when the michigan state highway department mshd had numbered and signed highways in the state in <year> it applied the m @-@ <num> number to grand river avenue across the state between grand haven and detroit
the m @-@ <num> designation lasted for seven years
as the states were meeting with the american association of state highway officials aasho now aashto to plan the united states numbered highway system the route of m @-@ <num> was originally planned to be included in us <num>
when the system was announced on november <num> <year> grand river avenue and m @-@ <num> became part of us <num>
the first change to the us <num> routing in the detroit area was made in <year> when the highway was moved to bypass farmington with the old routing retained as a state highway
the first planning map in <year> for what later became the interstate highway system showed a highway in the corridor
the general location of national system of interstate highways including all additional routes at urban areas designated in september <year> or yellow book after the cover color showed generalized plans for the locations of interstate highways as designated in <year>
this also included a highway in the us <num> corridor
the <year> approval for the interstate highway system replaced much of us <num> with a portion of interstate <num> i @-@ <num>
mshd submitted a recommended numbering plan for the interstates in <year> that showed i @-@ <num> following the us <num> corridor
the segments of the road between brighton and farmington were upgraded in <year>
the mshd initially signed the various freeways as interstates in <year> and us <num> through the farmington area gained the additional i @-@ <num> numbering
two years later the business route through farmington was redesignated as a business loop of i @-@ <num> instead of us <num>
the final connection for i @-@ <num> between lansing and brighton was completed in late <year> and the us <num> designation was decommissioned in the state
the sections of highway through the detroit metro area were given business loop bl or business spur bs i @-@ <num> designations
when i @-@ <num> was completed in <year> several highway designations were shifted in the metro detroit area
the bs i @-@ <num> designation was removed from grand river avenue
rather than revert to its original number m @-@ <num> mdot selected m @-@ <num> as the new highway designation
grand river was signed as m @-@ <num> between <num> mile road and its present eastern terminus at i @-@ <num> while leaving grand river avenue southeast of i @-@ <num> an unsigned state trunkline old bs i @-@ <num>
both the portion of bs i @-@ <num> north of <num> mile road and the stub of i @-@ <num> that continued out to i @-@ <num> became part of m @-@ <num>
originally included in the corridor for i @-@ <num> the michigan highway commission canceled the northern section of the highway on january <num> <year> after it spent <num>
<num> million equivalent to <num>
<num> million in <year> the year before purchasing land for the roadway
this northern section was not planned as an interstate highway at that time bearing the designation m @-@ <num> instead
opposition to construction came from various citizen 's groups and different levels of local government
additionally both the detroit news and detroit free press opposed the project
the detroit city council led by then @-@ chairman carl levin opposed the plan
levin said at the time at last i think people are waking up to the dangers of more and more expressways
at some point we 've got to say enough
and i think we 've reached it
the us department of the interior reviewed the state 's environmental impact study of the project and stated the project will cause irreparable damages on recreation lands wetlands surface waters and wildlife habitat
the total project to link farmington hills with davisburg with the <num> @-@ mile <num> km freeway would have cost <num>
<num> million equivalent to <num> million in <year> and saved drivers an estimated eight minutes off travel time around the city of detroit
after many years of inactivity further work began along this same route but the resulting highway was designated as a northern extension to m @-@ <num> rather than i @-@ <num> or m @-@ <num>
the first section of this freeway extension was opened in october <year>
this extended the route from m @-@ <num> 's previous terminus at m @-@ <num> <num> mile road over the latter highway 's alignment west and north to <num> mile road
a plan enacted by then governor john engler in <year> angered road officials when funding was diverted from county road commissions to help complete state highway projects like the m @-@ <num> haggerty connector project
in <year> a second extension of m @-@ <num> was completed to <num> mile road but only as an expressway
the final two miles <num>
<num> km between <num> mile road and pontiac trail opened to traffic on november <num> <year>
in <year> a roundabout was placed at the northern terminus of m @-@ <num>
this last project also included a northern extension of roadway into the eldorado golf course in commerce township to better serve the community
this extension does not carry the m @-@ <num> designation
the property is owned and operated by the university of california hastings college of the law
the tower includes mixed @-@ use offices on various floors and the art deco @-@ styled sky room with a panoramic view on the <num> floor
conceived as an unusual combination of a large church surmounted by a hotel construction of the building brought architectural dispute
initially designed by timothy l
pflueger in the style of gothic revival the investors fired his firm and hired lewis p
hobart who changed little of pflueger 's design
in a resulting lawsuit pflueger won nearly half the damages he asked for
the building opened in <year> as the william taylor hotel and temple methodist episcopal church
however extra construction expenses had put the congregation at greater financial risk and the church @-@ hotel concept did not prove popular
no profit was made in six years and the church left losing their investment
in the late <num> the building housed the empire hotel known for its sky room lounge then from world war ii to the <num> <num> mcallister served as u

reopening as university housing and offices in <year> mcallister tower is home to some <num> law students and their families
the tower is sited one block from the administrative and scholastic center of hastings college of the law and is the most prominent building in the district
from their initial <num> @,@ <num> they bought property at mcallister and leavenworth streets and hired the architectural firm of miller and pflueger to design the edifice
timothy l
pflueger was chosen as the designer
the new hotel intended to be dry serving no alcoholic beverages in the sinful city was to be named after william taylor a methodist episcopal street preacher and missionary who formed the first methodist church in san francisco
the large church was named temple methodist episcopal church or simply temple methodist
beginning in <year> pflueger designed a <num> ft <num> m <num> @-@ story step @-@ back skyscraper made of brick framed with steel along the lines of his just @-@ completed pacific telephone telegraph company building
its main decorative theme was neo @-@ gothic expressed strongly in the three gothic arches which formed the main street @-@ level entrance for the church
the great hall the large worship area located within the second third and fourth floors was to seat <num> @,@ <num> churchgoers and a smaller chapel was designed for <num> more
a grand pipe organ from skinner organ company was installed with four manuals controlling <num> @,@ <num> pipes
a stained glass window was placed <num> feet above the sanctuary representing faith love and hope in three tall narrow panels
two assembly halls could be combined to hold <num> @,@ <num> attendees for theatrical or athletic events
some <num> guest rooms and <num> tower apartments were intended to bring a steady flow of visitors and a source of profit to the church
though never the tallest building in san francisco it was to be the tallest hotel on the pacific coast for many decades
in a dispute the architectural firm of miller and pflueger was fired from the project and was replaced by lewis p
hobart
miller and pflueger sued for <num> @,@ <num> alleging that hobart 's design was little changed from pflueger 's original
three months after the hotel and church opened in january <year> miller and pflueger won <num> @,@ <num> in a favorable court decision
dedication of the church 's pipe organ took place august <num> <year>
the combined congregation was very satisfied with their new place of worship
eventually costing us <num>
<num> million <num> million in current value the building 's completion required several rounds of new financing from its investors in order to overcome unanticipated expenses
unfortunately for the congregation the idea of a hotel above a church didn 't attract the requisite number of guests and the venture failed to turn a profit
from <year> through <year> the church housed the theater of george coates performance works – an experimental multi @-@ media theater troupe that utilized the <num> foot high vaulted ceiling for projections
the temple methodist congregation lost its investment and was asked to leave
the skinner opus pipe organ was removed to be sold to occidental college in los angeles and rebuilt in their thorne hall
the three @-@ piece stained glass window was removed and exhibited eventually making its way to stockton california where it was installed in the morris chapel at the university of the pacific
the <num> mcallister building itself was refurbished the church 's floor area was given over to parking a coffee shop was built in part of the first floor lobby and the new enterprise opened again as the empire hotel noted for completing in <year> the first view lounge in the area the sky room on the <num> floor
with plush carpeting a large art deco @-@ style oval bar and plate glass windows on all sides the sky room provided a panoramic view of the city
architect engineer wrote of the luxurious bar in april <year> that it has no prototype west of new york referring to manhattan 's rainbow room which opened three @-@ and @-@ a @-@ half years earlier
s
government bought the building and converted it to federal offices officer billets spaces used by the army 's ordnance procurement department a passport agency and an induction center run by the local draft board
the high vaulted ceiling of the great hall worship center was hidden by a dropped ceiling
after the war the internal revenue service moved offices into the building
many federal groups at <num> mcallister moved their offices in <year> – <year> to the newly built federal building at <num> golden gate avenue later named the phillip burton federal building
occupancy at <num> mcallister was low though the united states army corps of engineers moved their san francisco district offices there in the <num> and local draftees were still required to appear there through the late <num>
the san francisco selective service system offices were located in the lower floors of the building during the vietnam war
calling it mcallister tower <num> units were modernized for residential use by law students and the building opened in <year> with a combination of compact studio units as well as larger one- and two @-@ bedroom apartments taking up a total of <num> floors
the building home to about <num> law students and their families is casually referred to as the tower by hastings residents and faculty who have but a one @-@ block commute to the law school 's main building at <num> mcallister
the old sky room with its spectacular <num> @-@ degree view reopened in <year> as the james edgar hervey skyroom in honor of alumnus james edgar hervey class of <year> a prominent san diego trial lawyer

<year> was a fula religious leader who led a jihad that created the imamate of futa jallon in what is now guinea
this was one of the first of the fulbe jihads that established muslim states in west africa
alfa ba karamoko alfa 's father formed a coalition of muslim fulbe and called for the jihad in <year> but died before the struggle began
the jihad was launched around <year> @-@ <year>
after a crucial concluding victory at talansan the state was established at a meeting of nine fulbe ulama who each represented one of the futa jallon provinces
ibrahima sambeghu who became known as karamokho alfa was the hereditary ruler of timbo and one of the nine ulama
he was elected leader of the jihad
under his leadership futa jallon became the first muslim state to be founded by the fulbe
despite this karamokho alfa was constrained by the other eight ulama
some of the other ulama had more secular power than karamokho alfa who directly ruled only the diwal of timbo for this reason the new state was always a tenuous confederation
karamoko alfa ruled the theocratic state until <year> when his excessive devotions caused him to become mentally unstable and sori was selected as de facto leader
karamokho alfa died around <year> and was formally succeeded by ibrahim sori his cousin
in the fifteenth century the valleys were occupied by mandé peoples susu and yalunka farmers
around that time fulbe herders began moving into the region grazing their livestock on the plateaux
at first they peacefully accepted a subordinate position to the susu and yalunka
the fulbe and mandé peoples intermixed to some extent and the more sedentary of the fulbe came to look down on their pastoral cousins
europeans began to establish trading posts on the upper guinea coast in the seventeenth century stimulating a growing trade in hides and slaves
the pastoral fulbe expanded their herds to meet the demand for hides
they began to compete for land with the agriculturalists and became interested in the profitable slave trade
they were increasingly influenced by their muslim trading partners
in the last quarter of the seventeenth century the zawāyā reformer nasir al @-@ din launched a jihad to restore purity of religious observance in the futa toro region to the north
he gained support from the torodbe clerical clan against the warriors but by <year> the movement had been defeated
some of the torodbe migrated south to bundu and some continued on to the futa jallon
the torodbe the kinsmen of the fulbe of the futa jallon influenced them in embracing a more militant form of islam
the jihad was launched around <year> or <year>
the movement was primarily religious and its leaders included both mandé and fulbe marabouts
the jihad also attracted some formerly non @-@ muslim fulbe who associated it not just with islam but with freedom of the fulbe from subordination to the mandé peoples
it was opposed by other non @-@ muslim fulbe and by non @-@ muslim yalunka leaders
according to tradition ibrahim sori symbolically launched the war in <year> by destroying the great ceremonial drum of the yalunka people with his sword
the jihadists then won a major victory at talansan
a force of <num> muslims defeated a non @-@ muslim force ten times greater killing many of their opponents
after this victory the state was established at a meeting of nine fulbe ulama who each represented one of the futa jallon provinces
ibrahima sambeghu who became known as karamokho alfa was the hereditary ruler of timbo and one of the nine ulama
he was elected leader of the jihad
he took the title almami or the imam
under his leadership futa jallon became the first muslim state to be founded by the fulbe
karamoko alfa managed to enlist disadvantaged groups such as gangs of young men outlaws and slaves
karamokho alfa 's maternal cousin was maka jiba the ruler of bundu and both men studied in fugumba under the famous scholar tierno samba
however there are no records of bundu participation in the futa jallon jihad perhaps because of the internal troubles in bundu at that time or perhaps because maka jiba was not greatly interested in the cause
although he was an inspired religious leader karamoko alfa was not qualified as a military leader
ibrahim sori took this role
some of the population resisted conversion for many years particularly the nomadic fulbe herders
they rightly feared that the marabouts would abuse their authority
the structure of the new fulbe state had an almami at its head karamokho alfa being the first with his political capital at timbo
however some of the other ulama had more secular power than karamokho alfa who directly ruled only the diwal of timbo
the religious capital was at fugumba where the council of the alama sat
the council operated as a strong curb on the power of the almami and the ulama retained much autonomy so the new state was always a loose federation
karamokho alfa was known for his islamic scholarship and piety
he respected the rights of the old masters of the soil saying it was allah who had established them
despite this ruling the imams reserved the right to reassign land since they held it in trust for the people
in effect the existing property owners were not displaced but now had to pay zakāt as a form of rent
karamoko alfa ruled the theocratic state until <year> when his excessive devotions caused him to become mentally unstable and sori was selected as de facto leader
ibrahim sori mawdo was chosen because alfa saadibu son of karamoko alfa was too young
ibrahim sori was an aggressive military commander who initiated a series of wars
after many years of conflict ibrahim sori achieved a decisive victory in <year> that consolidated the power of the fulbe state
the jihad had achieved its goals and ibrahim sori assumed the title of almami
under ibrahima sori slaves were sold to obtain munitions needed for the wars
this was considered acceptable as long as the slaves were not muslim
the jihad created a valuable supply of slaves from the defeated peoples that may have provided a motive for further conquests
the fulbe ruling class became wealthy slave owners and slave traders
slave villages were founded whose inhabitants provided food for their fulba masters to consume or sell
at one time more than half the population were slaves
as of <year> the fulbe were the largest ethnic group in guinea at <num> of the population after the malinke <num> and susu <num>
the jihad in futa jallon was followed by a jihad in futa toro between <year> and <year> led by sileymaani baal
the largest of the fulani jihads was led by the scholar usman dan fodio and established the sokoto caliphate in <year> stretching across what is now the north of nigeria
the fulbe muslim state of masina was established to the south of timbuktu in <year>
karamokho alfa came to be thought of as a saint
a story is told of a miracle that occurred more than a hundred years after his death
the chief of the ouassoulounké kondé buraima opened karamokho alfa 's tomb and cut off the left hand of the body
blood poured from the severed wrist causing kondé buraima to flee in terror
the two donnel carty and delano brown showed little or no remorse and were sentenced to life imprisonment
the crime gained national notoriety for the particularly brutal way in which pryce was murdered only metres from his own home and had only his oyster card and mobile phone taken from him but no money the case being widely reported as an example of steaming
the murderers were later tracked down when the police examined cctv footage of where the oyster card was used after the murder
the crime caused a political uproar and condemnation of railway station security
the tom ap rhys pryce memorial trust was set up after the murder and a school was built in his honour
pryce was born in broxbourne hertfordshire england
at the age of three the pryce family moved to somalia after pryce 's father john a civil engineer was sent to work there as part of a project to build a sugar factory there he enjoyed an idyllic early childhood
after <num> months they returned home to hertfordshire before moving in <year> to the family home in weybridge where tom grew up
his ancestry was one well known within the military and among his ancestors was his great @-@ grandfather general sir henry edward ap rhys pryce <year> – <year>

based on world war ii the game allows players to pilot fifteen reproductions of that era 's military aircraft and to carry out missions for the axis or allies
although it contains dogfights the game focuses largely on air @-@ to @-@ ground combat
jane 's attack squadron was first conceived by looking glass employee seamus blackley as flight combat a combat @-@ based sequel to flight unlimited
the company continued designing the game after blackley was fired in <year> and it entered production under electronic arts in <year>
the team experienced problems with deadlines and funding during development with the game eventually being heavily redesigned and renamed jane 's attack squadron at the request of the publisher
these issues contributed to looking glass 's bankruptcy and closure in <year>
in <year> and <year> the game was acquired and finished by mad doc software a company in part composed of former looking glass employees
the game received mixed to poor reviews
critics found its physics modelling unrealistic and many believed that the game 's graphics and gameplay were outdated particularly in light of contemporary simulators like il @-@ <num> sturmovik
the limited number of missions and large number of glitches were widely panned
certain critics enjoyed jane 's attack squadron 's air @-@ to @-@ ground combat and several hoped that fans would improve the game with the included physics and mission editors
the game is set in western europe during world war ii and players may control fifteen german and allied planes from the era including the focke @-@ wulf fw <num> supermarine spitfire junkers ju <num> avro lancaster and consolidated b @-@ <num> liberator
although dogfights are possible the game places a heavy focus on air @-@ to @-@ ground combat
objectives range from bombing and torpedo runs to defense and escort missions
the player may engage in tutorials quick missions single missions and a campaign
quick missions allow the player to select variables such as the objective and the number of friendly and enemy aircraft while single missions of which there are five are scripted pre @-@ made levels
two campaigns are available one each for the allies and germans
both campaigns feature ten missions that branch depending on the outcome achieved by the player
an online multiplayer component allows players to engage in dogfights
each plane in jane 's attack squadron is composed of forty @-@ five parts that may be removed or otherwise damaged in combat
damage to these parts affects performance for example a broken fuel line will leak quickly decreasing the fuel gauge
various adjustments may be made to the game 's realism including an arcade physics option that drastically reduces flight difficulty
the game is packaged with the mission and physics editors that were used to develop it
the magazine 's johnny l
wilson wrote if flight unlimited can pass the civilian tests the military version should be right behind it
in march of the next year blackley told pc gamer us that the sequel should feel so real that pilots will be afraid
they 'll feel the gun hits
he dismissed the flight dynamics in other flight simulators such as falcon <num>
<num> in favor of the real @-@ time computational fluid dynamics cfds model he created for flight unlimited
when pc gamer 's bernie yee asked why the team had waited to make a combat flight simulator blackley responded that they wanted to retrain players first
in september computer gaming world reported that blackley was designing a combat @-@ based sequel to flight unlimited under the working title flight combat
blackley told them that it would make you into a fighter pilot and the magazine commented that it would teach the same material as the air force
the team planned to allow players to practice an element and then execute it on a mission and blackley said that the game would feature competitive online play
however a new manager at looking glass technologies instated by venture capital investors demanded that blackley work on flight unlimited ii instead of flight combat
blackley refused and was fired leaving the company in late <year>
in march <year> pc gamer us reported that flight combat was still taxiing across the design board and that the team planned to focus on how the aerial manoeuvres are performed as you fight
looking glass designer constantine hantzopoulos told the magazine that a modified version of the flight unlimited engine was being used to develop flight combat and flight unlimited ii
hantzopoulos commented that flight combat was the project everybody at looking glass wants to work on
the team expected to be finished with the game in roughly one year
by june <year> gamespot reported that flight unlimited ii was running on the new zoar engine coded from scratch by programmer james fleming
in addition the real @-@ time cfds model from flight unlimited had been discarded as its programming was all black box spaghetti code from seamus
gamespot 's t
liam macdonald noted that the flight unlimited ii team expected soon to use the same engine for a combat flight simulator set in world war ii
computer gaming world similarly reported that the company was definitely hot to develop flight combat and that it might be created after flight unlimited ii
following that game 's completion the team could not decide between developing flight unlimited iii or flight combat
as a result they decided to develop them simultaneously and flight combat began production in early <year>
unlike all of the studio 's other games development of flight combat was funded through an insured bond in an attempt to guarantee that the game would be finished
the company 's tim stellmach later said that this setup was a real pain for the team in some ways
looking glass signed a multi @-@ game publishing deal with electronic arts in may <year> and that company became the publisher of flight combat
the team undersold the game to electronic arts and james sterrett of the fansite through the looking glass believed that the team gambled that it could get the game out the door faster than the budget actually called for
in march <year> the game was announced as the world war ii @-@ themed flight combat thunder over europe directed by hantzopoulos and scheduled for release in fall of that year
that may the game was shown at the electronic arts booth at e3
computer games magazine 's steve udell wrote that the game would feature a new iteration of the flight unlimited terrain renderer and ign reported that one million square miles of terrain based on european landscapes would be available
weather conditions such as snow and rain were planned
udell wrote that flight combat 's flight physics were an updated version of those from recent flight unlimited games with new material taken from operations manuals and flight tests
plane models and textures were based on photographs and many of the moving parts and flight control surfaces were modeled individually
players were given the option to customize planes
udell described a physics @-@ based damage system that according to the company made it impossible to see the exact same kind of damage twice
two campaigns — the battle of britain and the defence of the reich — were announced with missions based on dogfights air @-@ to @-@ ground combat and bombing runs
looking glass claimed that the game would feature moving tanks and ships duk ing it out on a dynamic battlefield as the player carried out missions
aesthetically ign 's tal blevins noted that the game had a very distinct <num> charm which was present from the briefings to the options screens
according to stellmach the publisher demanded that the game be heavily redesigned partway through development which exacerbated the team 's existing problems with meeting deadlines
sterrett believed that the game 's schedule and funding did not receive the necessary adjustments to allow for this redesign
together with flight unlimited iii 's commercial failure the expenses of jane 's attack squadron 's long development used up revenue from thief the dark project which had helped the company recover from the failure of terra nova strike force centauri and british open championship golf
compounding these problems business deals with microsoft irrational games and eidos interactive were unsuccessful
as a result looking glass studios went bankrupt in may <year>
at the time jane 's attack squadron was roughly three months from completion
thief ii gold and thief iii were cancelled as a result of the company 's closure but jane 's attack squadron because it was near completion and funded through an insured bond had a chance of being finished
according to gordon berg of computer gaming world the legal and logistical problems of keeping a portion of looking glass
intact to finish the game had been hurdled
further because of the game 's type of funding the continued development of jane 's attack squadron would have been at little cost to electronic arts
fans petitioned the publisher to let development continue and looking glass employee rich carlson said that hantzopoulos and others from the flight series roughly twenty in all were prepared to work on the game again
the petition reached <num> @,@ <num> signatures by may <num> and <num> @,@ <num> by june <num>
however electronic arts dropped the game
the publisher 's jeff brown said that the decision was based on our deep uncertainty that the project could meet any schedule given the changes in senior management and a history of missing deadlines
brown told the website combatsim that electronic arts had worked diligently with looking glass for more than two years and that although the game had missed its planned october <year> release they had been willing to delay the project into <year>
he blamed the developer 's closure for the decision to cancel the game
rumors circulated that the decision was part of the publisher 's larger plan to abandon the flight simulator genre and computer gaming world 's denny atkin later summarized that the company ran screaming from the simulation market after looking glass 's bankruptcy
electronic arts soon dropped the jane 's information group license
the game 's original lead designer and lead programmer were among those hired by mad doc
dotted line entertainment mad doc 's agent company secured the rights to the game 's code for the team in <year>
development commenced shortly afterward
in august of that year it was reported that the jane 's information group license had been obtained by xicat interactive and that the company planned to publish mad doc 's revival of jane 's attack squadron
the full details of the agreement were announced at that year 's european computer trade show where it was revealed that jane 's attack squadron would focus heavily on air @-@ to @-@ ground combat
according to mad doc 's tim farrar our goal wasn 't to create a completely new game it was to complete the game that was started at lg
farrar noted that although the company trimmed some of the more ambitious features jane 's attack squadron was effectively the same game created by looking glass
as with flight combat the game features one million square miles of terrain planes with individually modelled moving parts and a physics @-@ based damage system
in october <year> the game was officially announced in a press release by mad doc
steve nadeau the lead designer of the game at both development studios said that he looked forward to polishing jane 's attack squadron and giv ing it a new life
he believed that the team was very excited to finish the game a sentiment later echoed by the game 's producer david halpern
according to nadeau the presence of members of the looking glass team ensured that it would closely reflect our original vision of the game an action @-@ packed world war ii air combat simulation accessible to users of all skill levels
farrar announced that the team 's mission and physics editors would be released alongside the game which he hoped would generate interest among players
farrar later commented that because of the game 's physics @-@ based damage system and individually modelled components wings could be shot off and fuel tanks detonated
he also explained that coolant tanks could be hit giving the pilot a limited amount of time before the plane engine overheated
he wrote that losing a wing tip meant a bumpy ride but the loss of the tail caused the plane to spin into the ground
jane 's attack squadron went gold in march <year> and was released that month
he believed that its graphics would have been state of the art in <year> but he found them middling in <year> and he noted the presence of numerous glitches
he considered the game 's most serious flaw to be its low number of missions
although atkin found the air @-@ to @-@ air combat generally fun citing good pilot ai and decent flight physics he believed that the game 's bombing runs were its most outstanding element
he hoped that fans would use the mission and physics editors to improve the game and he concluded it 's buggy but when it works it 's worth flying
andy mahood of pc gamer us wrote that jane 's attack squadron is unquestionably an entertaining and unique wwii prop sim but he believed that it was clearly inferior to games such as il @-@ <num> sturmovik
he found the game 's graphics to be outdated and its design to be simplistic and he wrote that its somewhat basic flight model prevents advanced maneuvers
he praised the game 's sound effects and music as well as its intricate damage modeling as its best features
he finished by saying that because the genre was starving for fresh titles jane 's attack squadron could be recommended despite its flaws
ign 's tom chick found it unrealistic erratic and limited writing that it looks bad plays poorly and is unstable
he disliked its canned and rigidly scripted missions although he found its bombing runs interesting and its air @-@ to @-@ air combat features acceptable
however he believed that ease of shooting down aircraft made the damage system 's powerful amount of flexibility worthless
chick believed that the multiplayer component was one of the game 's worst features and he derided the game 's suspiciously canned physics which offered a grab bag of fidelity mixed in with heaps of silliness
he summarized jane 's attack squadron as awful
josh horowitz of the adrenaline vault noted the complex damage system and he believed that the game looks as good as most of today 's flight simulators although he experienced performance issues
he noted that the gameplay was hurt by corner cutting or general incompletion such as the limited in @-@ game tutorials
horowitz found the game repetitive because of its lack of missions and low sense of involvement and like chick he disliked its multiplayer and linear missions
although he offered significant praise for its sound horowitz concluded that the game was a buggy incomplete offering and that those looking for the next great jane 's title will likely be disappointed
gamespy 's bernard dy wrote that the game failed to live up to the jane 's combat simulations pedigree and he believed that those who enjoyed the realism of il @-@ <num> sturmovik will be disappointed
he disliked its relaxed flight models and lack of features and he cited a large number of glitches
however dy found its damage system robust and he believed that the game was not a total loss
like atkin he hoped that fans would improve the game with its detailed editors although he believed that this was somewhat unlikely
the hurricane season officially began on june <num> <year> and ended on november <num> <year>
it was slightly above average with <num> recorded tropical cyclones
the first storm alice had persisted since december <num> <year>
alice caused relatively minor impact as it tracked through the lesser antilles and eastern caribbean sea in early january
tropical storm brenda caused two deaths and minor damage along the gulf coast of the united states in early august
the quick succession of hurricanes connie and diane caused significant flooding in the northeastern united states with nearly <num> billion <year> usd in losses and at least <num> fatalities
the next three storms – hurricanes edith and flora and tropical storm five – caused very minor or no impact
in early august hurricane gladys caused severe localized flooding in mexico primarily in mexico city
additionally an offshoot of gladys inflicted minor impact in texas
hurricane hilda struck the greater antilles and then mexico
it was attributed to at least <num> deaths and <num> million in losses
in mid @-@ september hurricane ione struck eastern north carolina and contributed the flooding from connie and diane resulting in seven fatalities and <num> million in damage
later that month hurricane janet which peaked as a category <num> hurricane lashed several countries adjacent to the caribbean sea as well as mexico and british honduras
janet resulted in <num>
<num> million in damage and at least <num> deaths
an unnamed tropical storm in the month of october did not impact land
hurricane katie the final storm caused minor damage in a sparsely populated area of hispaniola totaling to at least <num> @,@ <num> <num> fatalities were also reported
collectively the storms caused <year> deaths and <num>
<num> billion in losses making it the costliest season at the time
a record number of names – four – were retired following the season which was tied by <year> and <year> and then surpassed in <year> when five names were retired
dunn was replacing grady norton who died from a stroke while forecasting hurricane hazel of the previous season
in early june the hurricane hunters received new reconnaissance aircraft which contained the latest radar and electronic equipment at the time
later that month shortly before the start of the <year> season a bill was proposed in the united states senate to provide funding for <num> new radar stations along the east coast of the united states
after the united states house of representatives passed a bill allotting <num> million the senate disputed about possibly increasing the funding two @-@ fold to <num> million
eventually the radars were installed starting in july <year>
after the devastating storms of the season particularly connie and diane a united states government organization with the propose of monitoring tropical cyclones was established in <year> with <num> @,@ <num> in funding it later became the modern @-@ day national hurricane center
the atlantic hurricane season officially began on june <num> <year>
it was an above average season in which <num> tropical cyclones formed
in a typical season about nine tropical storms develop of which five strengthen to hurricane strength
all thirteen depressions attained tropical storm status and eleven of these attained hurricane status
six hurricanes further intensified into major hurricanes
the season was above average most likely because of an strong ongoing la niña
hurricane alice developed in late december <year> but persisted into january <year> and was operationally analysed to have developed in the latter
within the official hurricane season bounds tropical cyclogenesis did not occur until july <num> with the development of tropical storm brenda
however during the month of august four tropical cyclones formed – including connie diane edith and an unnamed tropical storm
five additional tropical cyclones – flora gladys hilda ione and janet – all developed in september
tropical cyclogenesis briefly halted until an unnamed tropical storm formed on october <num>
the final storm of the season katie dissipated on october <num> almost a month before the official end of hurricane season on november <num>
eight hurricanes and two tropical storms made landfall during the season and caused <num> @,@ <num> deaths and <num>
<num> billion in damage
the season 's activity was reflected with an accumulated cyclone energy ace rating of <num> which was above the <year> @-@ <year> average of <num>
<num>
ace is broadly speaking a measure of the power of the hurricane multiplied by the length of time it existed so storms that last a long time as well as particularly strong hurricanes have high aces
it is only calculated for full advisories on tropical cyclones with winds exceeding <num> mph <num> km h which is tropical storm strength
operationally it was first observed as a hurricane on january <num> which resulted in it being named alice
the hurricane passed through the leeward islands on january <num>
alice reached peak winds of <num> mph <num> km h before encountering cold air and turning to the southeast
it dissipated on january <num> over the southeastern caribbean sea
alice produced heavy rainfall and moderately strong winds across several islands along its path
saba and anguilla were affected the most with total damage amounting to <num> @,@ <num>
operationally lack of definitive data prevented the u
s
weather bureau from declaring the system a hurricane until january <num>
it received the name alice in early <year> though re @-@ analysis of the data supported extending its track to the previous year resulting in two tropical cyclones of the same name in one season
it was one of only two storms to span two calendar years along with tropical storm zeta in <year> and <year>
during the next <num> hours the storm strengthened rapidly and attained its maximum sustain wind speed of <num> mph <num> km h early on august <num> although it is possible it briefly reached hurricane intensity
later that day brenda made landfall east of new orleans louisiana at the same intensity
the storm steadily weakened inland and by august <num> it was downgraded to a tropical depression
early on august <num> brenda dissipated while located over eastern texas
between pensacola florida and lake charles louisiana rainfall totals were generally about <num> inches <num> mm flooding if any was insignificant
tropical storm force winds were reported peaking at <num> mph <num> km h at shell beach louisiana on the south shore of lake borgne
at the same location tides between <num> and <num> feet <num>
<num> and <num>
<num> m above normal were measured
four people were rescued by the united states coast guard after their tugboat sank in lake pontchartrain while three others swam to shore
additionally two fatalities occurred in the vicinity of mobile alabama
after six hours it strengthened into tropical storm connie
by august <num> connie began to rapidly strengthen becoming the first major hurricane of the season later that day
initially it posed a threat to the lesser antilles although it passed about <num> miles <num> km north
the outer rainbands produced hurricane force wind gusts and intense precipitation reaching <num>
<num> inches <num> mm in puerto rico
in the united states virgin islands three people died due to the hurricane and a few homes were destroyed
in puerto rico connie destroyed <num> homes and caused crop damage
after affecting puerto rico connie turned to the northwest reaching peak winds of <num> mph <num> km h
the hurricane weakened while slowing and turning to the north and struck north carolina on august <num> as a category <num> hurricane
connie produced strong winds high tides and heavy rainfall as it moved ashore causing heavy crop damage and <num> deaths in the state of north carolina
connie made a second landfall in virginia and it progressed inland until dissipating on august <num> near sault ste
marie michigan
four people were killed in washington d
c
due to a traffic accident
in the chesapeake bay connie capsized a boat killing <num> people and prompting a change in coast guard regulation
there were six deaths each in pennsylvania and new jersey and eleven deaths in new york where record rainfall flooded homes and subways
at least <num> @,@ <num> people lost power during the storm
damage in the united states totaled around <num> million although the rains from connie was a prelude to flooding by hurricane diane
the remnants of connie destroyed a few houses and boats in ontario and killed three people in ontario
it slowly strengthened and became tropical storm diane on august <num>
after a fujiwhara interaction with hurricane connie diane curved northward or north @-@ northeastward and quickly deepened
by early on august <num> the storm was upgraded to a hurricane
only several hours later diane peaked as a category <num> hurricane with winds of <num> mph <num> km h
the storm resumed its west @-@ northwestward motion on august <num>
colder air in the region caused diane to weaken while approaching the east coast of the united states
a recently installed radar in north carolina noted an eye feature albeit poorly defined
early on august <num> diane made landfall near wilmington north carolina as a strong tropical storm
the storm then moved in a parabolic motion across north carolina and the mid @-@ atlantic before re @-@ emerging into the atlantic ocean on august <num>
diane headed east @-@ northeastward until becoming extratropical on august <num>
despite landfall in north carolina impact in the state was minor limited to moderate rainfall abnormally high tides and relatively strong winds
further north catastrophic flooding occurred in pennsylvania new jersey new york and new england
of the <num> stream gauges in the region <num> reported record levels after the flooding from tropical storm diane
many streams reported discharge rates that were more than twice of the previous record
most of the flooding occurred along small river basins that rapidly rose within hours to flood stage largely occurring in populated areas the region in which the floods occurred had about <num> million people and <num> houses overall were destroyed
the floods severely damaged homes highways power lines and railroads and affected several summer camps
overall utility damage was estimated at <num> million
flooding in mountainous areas caused landslides and destroyed crop fields agriculture losses was estimated at <num> million
hundreds of miles of roads and bridges were also destroyed accounting for <num> million in damage
overall diane caused <num>
<num> million in damage of which <num> million was in new england
overall there were at least <num> deaths
moving towards the west @-@ northwest the disturbance slowly intensified reaching tropical storm strength at <num> utc on august <num> and as such was named edith by the weather bureau
afterwards edith began to curve towards the northwest as it gradually intensified attaining hurricane strength on august <num>
the hurricane continued to intensify as it recurved and accelerated to the northeast reaching its peak intensity on august <num> as a category <num> hurricane with maximum sustained winds of <num> mph <num> km h
at the same time a reconnaissance aircraft reported a minimum barometric pressure of <num> mbar hpa <num>
<num> inhg in the storm 's eye as edith made its closest pass to bermuda
the hurricane began to gradually weaken after it passed east of the island before becoming extratropical on august <num>
the cyclone would later make a clockwise loop before dissipating completely late on september <num>
although edith remained at sea it was suspected that the hurricane may have caused the loss of the pleasure yacht connemara iv after it separated from its moorings
moving towards the north @-@ northwest the storm passed over western cuba on august <num> without much change in intensity
once in the gulf of mexico the tropical storm marginally intensified reaching peak intensity with maximum sustained wind speeds of <num> mph <num> km h by <num> utc on august <num>
nearing the gulf coast of the united states the system curved towards the west
the storm maintained its intensity up until landfall in louisiana near new orleans on august <num>
moving inland it slowly weakened while crossing the central united states degenerating to tropical depression strength by august <num> and later dissipating over missouri the following day
strong waves generated by the storm caused tides <num> ft <num>
<num> m above average slightly damaging coastal resorts
weather offices advised small craft offshore to remain in port due to the strong waves
rough seas battered the schooner princess friday but the ship was able to ride out the storm
the storm produced squalls further inland causing heavy rains
a weather station reported a minimum pressure of <num> mbar hpa <num>
<num> inhg the lowest in association with the tropical storm
despite the strong waves and heavy rains only minor damage was reported
although the panair do brasil headquarters in recife brazil reported a closed circulation on august <num> tropical storm flora did not develop until <num> utc on september <num> while located about <num> miles <num> km of cape verde
the storm strengthened at a steady pace for the following <num> hours and reached hurricane status late on september <num>
flora headed on a parabolic track initially moving west @-@ northwestward and then northwesterly by september <num>
it continued to intensify and by september <num> the storm curved northward
around time a minimum barometric pressure of <num> mbar <num>
<num> inhg was reported
however it may have been lower as the storm did not attain its maximum sustained wind speed of <num> mph <num> km h until september <num>
flora maintained this intensity while curving to the northeast but became extratropical at <num> utc on september <num> while located about midway between flores island in the azores and sable island nova scotia
six hours later it strengthened into tropical storm gladys
the storm quickly intensified and reached hurricane status on september <num> roughly <num> hours after developing
around that time gladys peaked as a category <num> hurricane with maximum sustained winds of <num> mph <num> km h
later on september <num> an offshoot of gladys with cyclonic turning formed in the northern gulf of mexico and struck texas on september <num> it may have been a separate tropical cyclone
initially gladys headed north @-@ northwestward but then re @-@ curved south @-@ southwestward while approaching the gulf coast of mexico
early on september <num> it made landfall near tampico tamaulipas as a weakening tropical storm
the system rapidly dissipated inland
gladys dropped up to <num> inches <num> mm in tampico tamaulipas
the worst of the flooding from gladys occurred in mexico city
roughly <num> @,@ <num> residents were isolated and required rescue
police estimated that <num> @,@ <num> homes were inundated with <num> to <num> feet <num>
<num> to <num>
<num> m of water
about <num> @,@ <num> families were impacted by the storm
two children drowned and five additional people were listed as missing
in texas the highest sustained wind speed was <num> mph <num> km h in the corpus christi – port o 'connor area with gusts between <num> and <num> mph <num> and <num> km h offshore
precipitation peaked at <num>
<num> inches <num> mm in flour bluff a neighborhood of corpus christi
flooding in the area forced scores of people to evacuate their homes
damage estimates reached <num> @,@ <num>
after six hours the depression strengthened into tropical storm ione
eventually it turned to the northwest
at <num> utc on september <num> ione reached hurricane intensity while situated north of the leeward islands
ione continued to deep while moving northwest
the storm reached category <num> intensity with maximum sustained winds of <num> mph <num> km h and a minimum barometric pressure of <num> mbar <num>
<num> inhg early on september <num>
around midday on the following day it made landfall near wilmington north carolina as a category <num> hurricane
shortly after moving inland over eastern north carolina ione weakened to a tropical storm
late on september <num> ione re @-@ emerged into the atlantic near norfolk virginia
the storm quickly re @-@ strengthened early on september <num> but transitioned into an extratropical cyclone on september <num>
strong winds heavy rainfall and abnormally high tides lashed some areas along the east coast of the united states especially north carolina
in cherry point sustained winds reached <num> mph <num> km h with gusts up to <num> mph <num> km h
overall damage was slightly more than <num> million mostly to crops and agriculture
rainfall in the state peaked at <num>
<num> inches <num> mm in maysville
storm surge in north carolina peaked at <num>
<num> feet <num>
<num> m in wrightsville beach
as a result several coastal roadways were flooded including a portion of highway <num> and route <num>
seven deaths were reported in north carolina
the remnants of ione brought gusty winds to atlantic canada which broken poles uprooted trees interrupted telephone service damaged chimneys and caused power outages especially in st
john 's newfoundland and labrador
it is estimated that the depression strengthened into tropical storm hilda early on the following day
hilda quickly intensified while moving westward into a small hurricane by september <num>
although the storm passed just north of hispaniola on september <num> damage is unknown if any
later that day hilda made landfall near the southeastern tip of cuba on september <num>
there it dropped heavy rainfall and produced gusty winds that destroyed <num> of the coffee crop in oriente province
in the eastern cuban city of baracoa hilda severely damaged the oldest church in the country
damage totaled <num> million in cuba and there were four deaths
later the hurricane moved across the caribbean sea causing light damage in the sparsely @-@ populated region of the eastern yucatán peninsula
after reaching the gulf of mexico hilda strengthened to reach peak winds of <num> mph <num> km h late on september <num>
before the hurricane moved ashore there was residual flooding in tampico from earlier hurricane gladys
hilda struck the city early on september <num> with gusts estimated at <num> mph <num> km h
the storm dropped heavy rainfall that flooded <num> of tampico while its strong winds damaged half of the homes leaving <num> @,@ <num> homeless
throughout mexico <num> @,@ <num> people were directly affected by hilda
overall the storm killed <num> people and caused over <num> million
additionally the outerbands of hilda caused minor flooding in southern texas particularly in raymondville
the hurricane formed from a tropical wave east of the lesser antilles on september <num>
moving toward the west across the caribbean sea janet fluctuated in intensity but generally strengthened before reaching its peak intensity as a category <num> hurricane on the saffir – simpson hurricane scale with winds of <num> mph <num> km h
the intense hurricane made landfall at that intensity near chetumal mexico on september <num>
janet 's landfall as a category <num> hurricane on the yucatán peninsula marked the first recorded instance that a storm of such intensity in the atlantic basin made on a continental mainland with all previous storms making landfall as category <num> hurricanes on islands
after weakening over the yucatán peninsula it moved into the bay of campeche where it slightly strengthened before making its final landfall near veracruz on september <num>
janet quickly weakened over mexico 's mountainous terrain before dissipating on september <num>
in its developmental stages near the lesser antilles janet caused significant damage to the island chain resulting in <num> deaths and <num>
<num> million in damages in the grenadines and barbados
while janet was in the central caribbean sea a reconnaissance aircraft flew into the storm and was lost with all eleven crew members believed perished
this was the only such loss which has occurred in association with an atlantic hurricane
a category <num> upon landfall on the yucatán peninsula janet caused severe devastation in areas on quintana roo and british honduras
only five buildings in chetumal mexico remained intact after the storm
an estimated <num> deaths occurred in the mexican state of quintana roo
at janet 's second landfall near veracruz significant river flooding ensued worsening effects caused by hurricanes gladys and hilda earlier in the month
the floods left thousands of people stranded and killed at least <num> people in the tampico area
the flood damage would lead to the largest mexican relief operation ever executed by the united states
at least <num> @,@ <num> deaths were attributed to hurricane janet as well as <num>
<num> million in damages
it is possible that the system developed into a tropical depression the next day although lack of data prevented such classification until september <num> when a nearby ship reported winds of <num> mph <num> km h
an approaching cold front turned the system to the north on september <num>
the structure gradually became better organized and after turning to the northeast on september <num> the depression intensified into a tropical storm
this was based on a ship report of <num> mph <num> km h winds which was also estimated as the system 's peak intensity
on september <num> the system became extratropical and accelerated its forward motion dissipating within a larger extratropical storm south of iceland on the next day
the system slowly developed a vertex as it curved in a generally northward direction
by early on october <num> two ships reported that a tropical depression formed almost halfway between the azores and the leeward islands
after six hours the depression strengthened into a tropical storm
while re @-@ curving to the northeast the storm attained its maximum sustained winds of <num> mph <num> km h the lowest atmospheric pressure recorded in relation to the storm was <num> @,@ <num> mbar <num> inhg but the time of measurement is unknown
although no significant weakening occurred it eventually merged with an extratropical cyclone on october <num> while still well southwest of the azores
during its extratropical stage a ship in the area reported an atmospheric pressure as low as <num> mbar <num>
<num> inhg
early on the following day the depression strengthened into tropical storm katie
the system moved generally northeast due to the presence of a strong low pressure area along the east coast of the united states
later that day hurricane hunters observed a rapidly intensifying hurricane encountering winds of <num> mph <num> km h and a pressure of <num> mbar <num>
<num> inhg several hours before the peak intensity
early on october <num> katie made landfall in extreme eastern sud @-@ est department haiti as a strong category <num> hurricane although it may have been stronger
about half of homes in the town of anse @-@ à @-@ pitres were destroyed
across the border in pedernales dominican republic <num> houses were damaged
overall losses were at least <num> @,@ <num> and <num> fatalities were reported
while crossing the mountainous terrain of hispaniola katie became very disorganized and rapidly weakened to a tropical storm early on october <num> within a few hours after moving inland
later that day the storm emerged into the atlantic ocean just east of puerto plata dominican republic
katie began accelerating to the northeast on october <num>
during that time the storm re @-@ intensified and briefly approached hurricane intensity although it failed to strengthen further due to interaction with a cold front
after passing just east of bermuda on october <num> the storm transitioned into an extratropical cyclone
the remnants of katie were last observed the following day
however two of such storms went unnamed
connie diane ione and janet would later be retired
the <year> season was tied with the <year> and <year> for the most storm names retired after a single season until five names were retired in <year>
storms were named brenda connie diane edith flora gladys hilda ione janet and katie for the first time
names not assigned are marked in gray
the <num> @-@ second piece formed the cornerstone of a £ <num> million advertising campaign targeting men in their late twenties and early thirties
the commercial shows in reverse the adventures of three characters who evolve from mudskippers to present day humans before tasting guinness in a london pub
the commercial was handled by the advertising agency abbott mead vickers bbdo with a budget of £ <num>
<num>
it was directed by daniel kleinman
production was contracted to kleinman productions with post @-@ production by framestore cfc
it premiered on british television on <num> october <year>
noitulove is the fifth television cinema piece in the good things come to those who wait series and its premiere marked the end of a four @-@ year hiatus
the advert and its associated campaign were a critical and financial success
it received over <num> awards from professional organisations in the advertising and television industries and was the most @-@ awarded commercial worldwide in <year>
the impact of the campaign was such that during a period in which the uk beer market experienced a substantial decline in revenue guinness reported that its year @-@ on @-@ year earnings within the region had noticeably increased
at the same time guinness achieved its highest @-@ ever volume and value shares and became the market leader within the region
this was attributed in no small part to the positive reception of noitulove
to the accompaniment of sammy davis jr
s rendition of the rhythm of life from the <year> film version of the <year> broadway musical sweet charity a reverse @-@ motion sequence begins
the three men retreat from the bar and into the street other patrons disappearing as they pass
as they move down the street a reverse time @-@ lapse @-@ style sequence transforms their clothes to match a rapidly changing urban scene which progresses through modern @-@ day london to the edwardian period
electric lights transform into gas lamps and buildings begin to disappear frame by frame
a short cutaway sequence shows the city regressing into the past shrinking to a small saxon settlement before disappearing entirely
returning to the main sequence the three men 's clothes and hairstyles are adjusted into bronze age equivalents as they pass through thickening woodland
a close @-@ up of one of the characters shows his features quickly transformed into those of a caveman
the trio are then frozen in an ice age glacier
the three re @-@ emerge from the glacier as primitive hominids their clothes ripped away to reveal loincloths
they continue to walk backwards with a more simian gait and soon turn into chimpanzees
from there they are transformed into a number of different species in quick succession including flying squirrels furry mammals aquatic mammals fish flightless birds small dinosaurs and burrowing lizard @-@ like creatures
the environment around them changes rapidly as they travel with cutaways showing millions of years of geological changes occurring in less than a few seconds
finally the three become mudskippers around a green @-@ brown puddle
the action briefly moves forward again to show the middle character registering his disgust at the taste of the water with a pweugh sound
the commercial ends with a transition to a product shot of three pints of guinness accompanied by the strapline good things come to those who wait
they produced several commercials using variations on the theme including swimblack bet on black and the critically acclaimed surfer voted the best advert of all time by the british public in <year>
after the <year> dreamer advertisements diageo the corporate owners of guinness decided to pursue a more pan @-@ european marketing strategy
the strapline proved difficult to translate and was abandoned
several new straplines were tried out over the next three years including believe free and tom crean and a story of darkness and light moth and mustang
the new marketing strategy did not prove particularly successful and in <year> diageo returned to regional advertising
amv bbdo were presented with the choice of coming up with either a new theme to appeal to the <num> – <num> british male demographic or a new angle on the tried and tested good things
concept
a number of ideas were put forward including the longest wait
from this concept noitulove was quickly plotted out the advert would show three individuals waiting <num> @,@ <num> @,@ <num> years before finally taking their first sip of guinness the timeline compressed into a <num> @-@ second clip
the decision to run the evolution sequence in reverse was taken fairly early as it was felt that it would better hold viewers interest during a <num> @-@ second television spot
after looking over the concept pitch and a rough draft of the script kleinman 's immediate impressions were that the idea was fresh an opportunity to try out some new techniques and that it would put guinness back on track doing a big wow idea
kleinman contacted a pair of canadian graphic novel artists to begin the storyboarding process
storyboarding the commercial meant that the agency could determine how much of the £ <num>
<num> budget to allocate to each section and provided them with visuals to use as part of the presentation to diageo when pitching the various concepts for a decision on which to pursue
the effort paid off and approval was given to move ahead with production
time @-@ lapse photographs were taken of the country 's mudpots volcanic terrain and frozen lakes using <num> mm film cameras
the shooting was done in the early summer for the nearly continuous daylight that the season afforded them
the next pieces of the commercial to be assembled were the live @-@ action segments shot in a greenscreen studio in london
filming was done in three stages with the three actors changing into different sets of prosthetic makeup at each stage
for the final section the actors spent a week practising the choreography behind walking backwards with an appropriately simian gait
wires were attached to the back of each actor allowing them to lean forwards to give the impression that they were being sucked back in time when the final cut was put together
while filming the actor sequences vfx supervisor william bartlett filmed the aerial view of london from tower <num> 's vertigo bar
with computer @-@ generated imagery looking to make up so much of the commercial kleinman attempted to use film of real elements wherever possible
to this end <num> mudskippers were brought to the studio from south africa for the final scene arriving via singapore
an entire afternoon was set aside for filming the mudskipper sequence
the footage obtained formed the major part of the final cut of the scene with only one or two post @-@ production changes the addition of tail fins and animation of the expression of disgust that closes the piece
stop motion footage of other real elements was taken including a stage @-@ by @-@ stage blowtorching of plants used to show flora coming back to life in the reverse sequence and shots of baking bread used to model the geological changes to background rock formations
additional real elements were to have been incorporated into the commercial mostly from stock footage of several animal species but only short segments of apes and lizards appeared in the final cut
the project was overseen by william bartlett known for his visual effects work on the bbc television documentary walking with dinosaurs
the original schedule allowed for three and a half months in post @-@ production with airing of the commercial to follow almost immediately
the <num> @-@ man animation team was split into two groups
half were assigned to the creation of the <num> new cgi creatures populating noitulove in maya while the other half created the backgrounds in houdini
compositing work – combining the greenscreen shots with stock footage and cgi elements – was performed in flame and inferno
as the final commercial was to be shown on cinema screens the animators worked at a resolution higher than that afforded by the 576i definition used by british pal @-@ encoded television sets to improve the appearance of the advert when projected
near the end of post @-@ production the creative team decided that the music chosen to accompany the advert an electronic track by groove armada was not working particularly well
peter raeburn who had chosen the track used in surfer leftfield 's phat planet was brought on as music director
raeburn suggested three pieces with rhythm of life ultimately presented to guinness as an alternative and approved as a replacement
as had been the case with several earlier campaigns the commercial was to air in several bursts throughout <year> and <year>
spots were purchased in the commercial breaks of sports broadcasts high @-@ budget television dramas and shows whose primary audience overlapped with the campaign 's target demographic of british males in the <num> – <num> age range
the first burst was commissioned to run from <num> october to <num> november <year> during programming such as the uefa champions league lost vincent ant and dec 's saturday night takeaway and terrestrial television screenings of austin powers goldmember
the second burst lasted through december
the focus moved to multichannel television with appearances in live televised football matches films and popular programming such as i 'm a celebrity get me out of here
two further bursts were commissioned for <year> to run from <num> may to <num> june and <num> august to <num> october
programmes selected for the may – june burst included celebrity x factor big brother and live football and cricket matches
the final series of spots ran during programming totalling <num> ratings points per week <num> of british television viewers with much of the budget assigned to multichannel television
advertising age said of the piece a flawless dgi production to an irresistible piece of music propelling a brilliant astonishingly witty new iteration of a longstanding unique positioning
this isn 't just great advertising it is perfect advertising
gastón bigio executive creative director for del campo nazca saatchi saatchi remarked on the campaign in the run @-@ up to the festival saying noitulove is in my opinion the best

this execution is absolutely incredible as is the production
the main competition for the prize was thought to be the australian big ad for carlton draught beer and the british balls for sony 's bravia line of high definition television sets
after the three received gold lions in the film category they were shortlisted by the judges as contenders for the grand prix
ultimately the honour went to noitulove
after the decision david droga president of the jury which determined the outcome said it 's a very very strong ad
a lot of the jurors felt that it was not only a stand @-@ alone remarkable ad but also a triumphant return for a fabulous campaign
the victory placed director daniel kleinman at number <num> in the independent 's list of the top <num> newsmakers of <year>
the <year> edition of the gunn report an authoritative annual publication determining the advertising industry 's most critically successful campaigns revealed that noitulove had received more awards that year than any other campaign worldwide
among the awards were three clios two golden sharks and the special jury prize at the imagina awards
the ad was also a hit with the public
it has been credited by guinness as being responsible for the substantial boost in sales experienced by the brand during the period in which it was broadcast
while revenues within the uk beer market declined by an average of − <num>
<num> − £ <num> the year @-@ on @-@ year figures for guinness showed an increase of <num>
<num> £ <num>
<num>
between october <year> and october <year> guinness achieved its highest ever volume <num>
<num> and value <num>
<num> shares taking the position of market leader from stella artois
diageo attributed the growth in no small part to the positive reception garnered by noitulove
new versions of the two adverts were produced showing the first few seconds of the original spot before being interrupted by digit al an animated spokesman for the campaign
in <year> guinness launched a retrospective television advertising campaign promoting guinness extra cold stout featuring new ten @-@ second versions of commercials broadcast between <year> and <year>
these included mars with rutger hauer reprising his role as the pure genius anticipation fish bicycle surfer and bet on black
noitulove joined the campaign in <year> and was the only piece to receive more than one new version
in the first of these the patrons are encased only seconds after taking their first sip of guinness in a glacier identical to the one which appeared half @-@ way through the original spot
in the second the sea through which the three fish bound backwards in the original spot is frozen while the trio are in mid @-@ leap leaving the characters skidding across the surface
in the final version the primeval pool at the end of the original spot freezes while the mudskippers are taking their drink and the protagonists tongues are left stuck in the ice
when noitulove was first proposed it was the only pitch revisiting the good things come to those who wait campaign as according to copywriter ian heartfield both amv bbdo and diageo didn 't think they could do something good enough to warrant following on from surfer and the like
however following the success of noitulove three additional commercials have been aired within the good things

he moved schools to harrington high and also played for local young sides pudsey juniors holbeck and later farsley celtic

under cherry 's replacement terry dolan the club held off any relegation threats to finish tenth in <year> – <num>
like jackson mccall and hendrie were both keen to move to a division one club but they agreed in <year> to stay for one final season

they mounted a promotion challenge in <year> – <num> and were top for much of the season until they faltered in the new year
when promotion was missed initially by one point on the last day of the season after a <num> – <num> defeat against ipswich town and then through play @-@ off defeat to middlesbrough mccall left the club signing for everton for £ <num> @,@ <num> in june <year>
he had played <num> league games for the club scoring <num> goals and in total played <num> games scoring <num> goals

<num> million
rangers had just won their third successive scottish premier division title
under newly appointed manager walter smith mccall ended up playing in the final six of the club 's nine successive scottish league titles
in his first season at ibrox rangers won the league and cup double before they achieved greater success in <year> – <num> winning both cups <num> – <num> against aberdeen and coming nine points ahead of aberdeen in the league
mccall also enjoyed european success that season when the glasgow club narrowly missed out on an appearance in the uefa champions league <year> – <num> final coming second in the semi @-@ final group stage to eventual winners olympique de marseille
citing the reason for their success as the spirit which smith instilled in the team mccall later said it was an incredible season
we won the domestic treble we went <num> games unbeaten and we did not lose a single game in europe
and though we said we would do it again next year we all knew it was unrepeatable
in <year> – <num> rangers added another scottish league cup title along with the league championship but lost <num> – <num> in the final of the scottish cup to dundee united surprisingly being denied a second successive treble
the following season saw rangers win the league by their greatest margin as they finished <num> points ahead of motherwell but they failed to reach the final of either of the domestic cups

but with the club chasing an unprecedented <num> straight title in <year> – <num> they had to settle for the runners @-@ up position with celtic winning the league by two points on the final day of the season
mccall was substituted in the scottish cup final defeat to hearts as rangers went the season without picking up a single title for the first season in mccall 's time at the club
in february <year> mccall became the 71st inductee into the rangers hall of fame
mccall 's former teammate and rangers assistant manager ally mccoist presented him with the award
barnsley and huddersfield town were both interested in signing mccall but he rejoined bradford city as club captain
rookie manager paul jewell put together a squad which emerged as surprise promotion contenders after two seasons spent battling relegation adding other new signings including central midfield partner gareth whalley and striker lee mills who went on to be club 's top goal @-@ scorer
the season started off slowly with just one win from the first seven games but by the latter half of the season city were vying with ipswich town and birmingham city for the second promotion spot behind runaway leaders sunderland
loan signing lee sharpe and dean windass were added to the ranks and city had the chance to seal promotion in their penultimate game against relegation @-@ threatened oxford united
the game finished as a <num> – <num> draw with mccall heading over the goal in the final minutes taking the promotion bid to the final game of the season
days later he was named the club 's player of the year
a <num> – <num> victory over wolverhampton wanderers at molineux on <num> may <year> ensured promotion to the premier league and denied ipswich town – the team that had thwarted mccall and bradford <num> years before
bradford were expected to struggle in their first season in the top flight for <num> years
jewell signed david wetherall dean saunders and neil redfearn all experienced top flight performers but city were in the bottom four teams for most of the season
it was bradford 's home form – they earned <num> of their <num> points at valley parade – that was key to city avoiding relegation which was narrowly averted by two points after a shock <num> – <num> final day victory over liverpool in <year> – <year> sending wimbledon down instead

his playing career at bradford city had looked uncertain in december <year> before law arrived when previous manager jim jefferies had left mccall out of the side in a <num> – <num> defeat at manchester city following a training ground dispute
however it was jefferies who lost out in the dispute when he resigned his post a week later after summit talks with chairman geoffrey richmond

mccall played just two league cup games in the <year> – <num> season and retired just a few weeks before his 41st birthday
his career total of <num> league games placed him in <num> position on the all @-@ time appearance list of british footballers
however he was only picked as a substitute and the referee blew the final whistle with mccall waiting to come on
he later told scottish newspaper glasgow herald i felt it was a mistake almost from the start
i was put on the bench and they tried to bring me on with a minute to go
but i took my time re @-@ tying my boots and generally warming up and luckily didn 't get on otherwise that would have been that
as a result mccall was still eligible for both england and scotland and he eventually switched allegiances to the latter for whom he qualified through his father
he made his scotland debut at under @-@ <num> level in march <year> ironically against england

mccall played just two qualifying games for the <year> world cup and his last cap came in a friendly against denmark on <num> march <year> as he was overlooked for the final squad for the finals in france along with team @-@ mate ally mccoist
he was capped a total of <num> times for scotland scoring one goal
mccall 's caps included <num> while at everton and <num> during his career with rangers
just four months later hutchings was sacked and mccall was appointed as caretaker – player manager
his first game in the role was against his former team everton who were led by his former manager walter smith but ended with a <num> – <num> defeat
he was in charge for one more game which also ended in defeat until jim jefferies was appointed the new manager
jefferies brought with him his own assistant billy brown and mccall was appointed first @-@ team coach
after leaving bradford city he joined sheffield united where he also took up a coaching role
when he retired in <year> he remained at sheffield united as assistant to neil warnock
working alongside warnock and learning the managerial ropes from him he helped mastermind sheffield 's promotion to the premier league in <year>
united were relegated to the championship on the final day of the <year> – <num> season and warnock resigned three days later
mccall had already decided that the <year> – <num> season would be his last as assistant manager and when he was overlooked as a successor to the united manager 's position in favour of bryan robson he decided to leave after five years with the club
he had been linked with the manager 's position at bradford city on numerous previous occasions and after colin todd was sacked on <num> february <year> city chairman julian rhodes made mccall his number one target to take over in the summer
club captain david wetherall temporarily took over and was later announced as caretaker manager for the rest of the <year> – <num> season
on <num> may <year> it was announced mccall would become full @-@ time manager of the club where he started his career and on <num> june <year> he assumed the position
in less than seven years since mccall 's first two @-@ game reign serious financial problems had driven the club to the verge of closure and although they survived the threat of oblivion they were unable to avoid a terrible on @-@ the @-@ pitch decline which continued after the financial nightmare had been relieved
on mccall 's return to valley parade the bantams had just been relegated to league two — meaning that they would be playing in the bottom division for the first time in <num> years
mccall set himself a target of earning promotion back to league one in his first season
bradford had just <num> players when mccall took over and he made a number of summer signings including defender darren williams midfielders kyle nix alex rhodes and scott phelan and strikers barry conlon guylain ndumbu @-@ nsungu and peter thorne
mccall recorded his first win as a manager against wrexham on <num> august <year> after substitute luke medley scored a late winner but despite his pre @-@ season target his team spent much of the first half of the season in the bottom half of the table
after going unbeaten in january the club were still <num> in league two and mccall told the telegraph argus he did not regret his pre @-@ season target but was carried away with the euphoria at the time
city 's form continued to improve during the second half of the season and mccall led his side to <num> place in league two
despite city finishing outside the play @-@ off places they were again installed as favourites for promotion by bookmakers for the <year> – <num> season
mccall released <num> players from his squad and replaced them with a number of signings with experience in a higher division as well as michael boulding who was one of league two 's top goalscorers during the <year> – <num> campaign
mccall 's side made a good start to the season and after winning five of their opening six league games went top of the league – the first time city had led the table in seven years
as a result of maintaining a place in the promotion places during the first half of the season and his stabling influence on the club chairmen julian rhodes and mark lawn offered mccall a new contract in january <year>
later in the month lawn gave further backing to mccall who was coming under pressure from the club 's fans following a run of one win in nine games during the run mccall was also charged by the football association for the first time of his managerial career after he had contested a refereeing decision during a game with luton town
mccall signed a new contract in february which extended his deal by another two years and would have kept him at the club until <year>
he set himself the goal of earning two promotions to put city in the championship
however less than a month later mccall offered to resign if they did not reach the play @-@ offs after his side lost <num> – <num> to bournemouth – their fifth consecutive away defeat
nobody is hurting more than me but it 's as simple as that if we miss out i don 't deserve to be here he said
city eventually missed out on promotion but mccall decided to stay on as manager and took a voluntary pay cut in the process because of the club 's budget being reduced
as a result of the cuts mccall made a number of changes to his squad during the summer of <year>
his team started the <year> – <num> season by going four games without scoring until they recorded a <num> – <num> victory against cheltenham town
after the game mccall said that was the youngest and certainly cheapest team bradford have put out for a long time and i ’ m really proud of them
city continued by going ten games unbeaten and reached the area semi @-@ finals of the football league trophy where they lost to carlisle united managed by mccall 's friend greg abbott but at the start of <year> found themselves <num> in league two and eight points off the play @-@ offs after a run of five defeats in seven games
mccall laid down a challenge to his team to win three of their next four games saying the bottom line is that the players and me personally will get judged on results
and the results aren 't good enough
despite the club 's slide down the table he denied he would resign but it was reported that two late goals from summer signing gareth evans to give city a late <num> – <num> away at torquay united saved mccall from being sacked
however defeat to bury in the club 's following fixture was mccall 's last game as manager with mccall saying after the game it 's time for somebody else to come in and take up the reins and hopefully do well
he won a little more than one @-@ third of his <num> games in charge of city
mccall left by mutual consent
at the end of <year> he was among a number of men interviewed for the managerial vacancy at scottish premier league side motherwell to succeed craig brown before being given the job on a two @-@ and @-@ a @-@ half @-@ year contract
his first game in charge was a <num> – <num> draw away to hamilton academical on new year 's day <year> with mccall stating it was a fair result
you take positives a clean sheet but we can be better and we will be better
he followed it up with a <num> – <num> victory in the scottish cup against dundee before his maiden league victory – and the club 's first since november – against hibernian by the end of january
mccall was partly selected as new manager because of his knowledge of the lower leagues of english football he was active in the transfer market in his early days bringing in steve jones – a player he had at bradford – and mike grella from leeds united although the latter move was cancelled because of a fifa ruling limiting the number of clubs a player can sign for in one season
having operated without an assistant for his first few weeks in charge mccall chose former airdrie united manager kenny black as his number two
mccall led motherwell to the semi @-@ finals of both scottish cup competitions – they were defeated <num> – <num> by his former side rangers in the league cup but reached the final of the scottish cup by defeating st johnstone <num> – <num>
at the start of the following season motherwell lost only one match in their first six making them joint leaders of the scottish premier league which led to mccall being named the clydesdale bank premier league manager of the month for july and august
well continued their good form with mccall winning the award again in october alongside player of the month keith lasley in a month when the side went unbeaten
motherwell 's final position in the premier league was in <num> allowing them into the champions league for the first time in the club 's history
at the start of the <year> @-@ <num> season mccall was unable to make signings after losing ten players
in the summer transfer window he made two signings simon ramsden and fraser kerr
mccall attempted to sign the returning james mcfadden and ryan stevenson but both were unsuccessful
mccall then managed the club 's first champions league match in the second round against panathinaikos but they proved to be too strong and motherwell failed to win either leg losing <num> @-@ <num> and <num> @-@ <num> respectively which mccall described as cruel
after the match motherwell entered the europa league play @-@ offs to face levante mccall wanted to play with an up @-@ and @-@ at @-@ them approach against the spaniards
once again their opposition proved to be too strong and they lost each leg <num> – <num> and <num> – <num> respectively ending the club 's european competitions the second game at the estadi ciutat de valència had motherwell playing with a youthful and inexperienced squad due to injuries
on <num> january <year> it was announced mccall would join the backroom staff of new scotland national football team manager gordon strachan
during the <year> <num> season the club managed to stay in the top @-@ six
on <num> march <year> mccall signed a new two @-@ year contract with motherwell
in april <year> mccall was awarded march 's spl manager of month for helping the club win three and draw one of their games during the month
at the end of the season motherwell finished second for the first time their highest league position since <year> @-@ <num> season which he described as incredible
as a result mccall won clydesdale bank manager of the year
on <num> may <year> it was reported that he was set to open talks with sheffield united about their managerial vacancy in the next <num> hours and that he had cut short a family holiday to intend the interview
eventually mccall rejected a move to sheffield united following talks between the two and was happy to continue as manager of motherwell claiming it was the wrong time to join united
at the start of the <year> @-@ <num> season key players darren randolph nicky law chris humphrey michael higdon and henrik ojamaa all left the club
mccall replaced them by signing paul lawson iain vigurs john sutton fraser kerr gunnar nielsen and stephen mcmanus
he also managed to persuade james mcfadden to stay at the club
motherwell enjoyed another successful season finishing second in the <year> – <num> scottish premiership

black @-@ tailed jackrabbits occupy mixed shrub @-@ grassland terrains
their breeding depends on the location it typically peaks in spring but may continue all year round in warm climates
young are born fully furred with eyes open they are well camouflaged and are mobile within minutes of birth thus females do not protect or even stay with the young except during nursing
the average litter size is around four but may be as low as two and as high as seven in warm regions
the black @-@ tailed jackrabbit does not migrate or hibernate during winter and uses the same habitat of <num>

its diet is composed of various shrubs small trees grasses and forbs
shrubs generally comprise the bulk of fall and winter diets while grasses and forbs are used in spring and early summer but the pattern and plant species vary with climate
the black @-@ tailed jackrabbit is an important prey species for raptors and carnivorous mammals such as eagles hawks owls coyotes foxes and wild cats

woodlands and early seral succeeding each other low- to mid @-@ elevation coniferous forests
it is also common in and near croplands especially alfalfa medicago sativa fields
females usually breed in the spring of their second year although females born in spring or early summer may breed in their first year
ovulation is induced by copulation
the breeding season is variable depending upon latitude and environmental factors
in the northern part of their range in idaho black @-@ tailed jackrabbits breed from february through may
in utah they breed from january through july with over <num> of females pregnant by april
the kansas breeding season extends from january to august
breeding in warm climates continues nearly year @-@ round
two peak breeding seasons corresponding to rainfall patterns and growth of young vegetation occur in california arizona and new mexico
in arizona for example breeding peaks during winter january – march rains and again during june monsoons
the gestation period ranges from <num> to <num> days
more litters are born in warm climates the number of litters born each year ranges from two per year in idaho to seven in arizona

female black @-@ tailed jackrabbits do not prepare an elaborate nest
they give birth in shallow excavations called forms that are no more than a few centimeters deep
females may line forms with hair prior to giving birth but some drop litters in existing depressions on the ground with no further preparation
young are born fully furred with eyes open and are mobile within minutes of birth
females do not protect or even stay with the young except during nursing
ages of weaning and dispersal are unclear since the young are well camouflaged and rarely observed in the field
captive black @-@ tailed jackrabbits are fully weaned by <num> weeks
the young stay together for at least a week after leaving the form
it requires mixed grasses forbs and shrubs for food and shrubs or small trees for cover
it prefers moderately open areas without dense understory growth and is seldom found in closed @-@ canopy habitats
for example in california black @-@ tailed jackrabbits are plentiful in open chamise ademostoma fasciculatum and ceanothus spp

diurnal movement of <num> to <num> miles <num> – <num> km occurs from shrub cover in day to open foraging areas at night
home range area varies with habitat and habitat quality
home ranges of <num>
<num> to <num>
<num> mi2 <num> – <num> km2 have been reported in big sagebrush artemisia tridentata and black greasewood sarcobatus vermiculatus communities of northern utah
black @-@ tailed jackrabbits require shrubs or small conifers for hiding nesting and thermal cover and grassy areas for night feeding
a shrub @-@ grassland mosaic or widely spaced shrubs interspersed with herbs provides hiding cover while providing feeding opportunities
small shrubs do not provide adequate cover
in the snake river birds of prey study area in southwestern idaho black @-@ tailed jackrabbits were more frequent on sites dominated by big sagebrush or black greasewood than on sites dominated by the smaller shrubs winterfat krascheninnikovia lanata or shadscale atriplex confertifolia
black @-@ tailed jackrabbits do not habitually use a burrow although they have occasionally been observed using abandoned burrows for escape and thermal cover
throughout the course of a year black @-@ tailed jackrabbits feed on most if not all of the important plant species in a community
growth stage and moisture content of plants may influence selection more than species
shrubs generally comprise the bulk of fall and winter diets while grasses and forbs are used in spring and early summer
this pattern varies with climate herbaceous plants are grazed during greenup periods while the plants are in prereproductive to early reproductive stages and shrubs are used more in dry seasons
shrubs are browsed throughout the year however
most of a jackrabbit 's body water is replaced by foraging water @-@ rich vegetation
jackrabbits require a plant 's water weight to be at least five times its dry weight to meet daily water intake requirements
therefore black @-@ tailed jackrabbits switch to phreatophyte deep @-@ rooted shrubs when herbaceous vegetation is recovering from their foraging
plant species used by black @-@ tailed jackrabbits are well documented for desert regions
forage use in other regions is less well known
however black @-@ tailed jackrabbits browse douglas fir pseudotsuga menziesii ponderosa pine pinus ponderosa lodgepole pine p
contorta and western hemlock tsuga heterophylla seedlings and oak quercus spp
seedlings and sprouts
rabbitbrush chrysothamnus spp
spiny hopsage gray spinosa and black greasewood are also browsed

in butte county idaho winterfat comprises <num> of black @-@ tailed jackrabbits annual diet
grasses comprise <num> of the diet with most grass consumption in march and april
russian thistle salsoda kali is an important forb diet item
needle @-@ and @-@ thread grass stipa comata and indian ricegrass oryzopsis hymenoides are preferred grasses
other preferred native grasses include sandberg bluegrass poa secunda and bluebunch wheatgrass pseudoroegneria spicata
where available crested wheatgrass agropyron desertorum and agropyron cristatum and barley hordeum vulgare are highly preferred
cheatgrass bromus tectorum use is variable it comprises <num> of the april diet on two southern idaho sites but black @-@ tailed jackrabbit on an eastern washington site do not use it

are the most commonly grazed grasses
leather croton croton pottsii silverleaf nightshade solanum elaeagnifolium desert marigold baileya multiradiata wooly paperflower psilostrophe tagetina and globemallow sphaeralcea spp
are important forbs although many forb species are grazed
opuntia spp
saguaro carnegiea gigantea and other cacti are used throughout the year but are especially important in dry seasons as a source of moisture
the black @-@ tailed jackrabbit and townsend 's ground squirrel spermophilus townsendii are the two most important prey species on the snake river birds of prey study area
hawks preying on black @-@ tailed jackrabbits include the ferruginous hawk buteo regalis white @-@ tailed hawk buteo albicaudatus swainson 's hawk b
swainsoni and red @-@ tailed hawk b

in many areas black @-@ tailed jackrabbit is the primary item in coyote diets
it is locally and regionally important to other mammalian predators
one study found that jackrabbits made up <num> of the bobcat diet in utah and nevada
another utah – nevada study found that jackrabbits were the fourth @-@ most commonly consumed prey of mountain lions
rattlesnakes crotalus spp
and garter snakes thamnophis sirtalis prey on black @-@ tailed jackrabbit young
raccoons procyon lotor and striped skunks mephitis mephitis may also capture young
diseases affecting the black @-@ tailed jackrabbit in the west are tularemia equine encephalitis brucellosis q fever and rocky mountain spotted fever
ticks are vectors for tularemia and infected ticks have been found on jackrabbits in the west
jackrabbits infected with tularemia die very quickly
the high prevalence of disease and parasites in wild jackrabbits affects human predation
many hunters will not collect the jackrabbits they shoot and those who do are well advised to wear gloves while handling carcasses and to cook the meat thoroughly to avoid contracting tularemia
most hunting of jackrabbits is done for pest control or sport
the battle was fought between <num> and <num> august <year> near the egyptian town of romani and the site of ancient pelusium on the sinai peninsula <num> miles <num> km east of the suez canal
this victory by the <num> lowland division and the anzac mounted division of the egyptian expeditionary force eef over a joint ottoman and german force which had marched across the sinai marked the end of the defence of the suez canal campaign also known as the offensive zur eroberung des suezkanals and the i̇kinci kanal harekâtı which had begun on <num> january <year>
this british empire victory the first against the ottoman empire in the war ensured the safety of the suez canal from ground attacks and ended the central powers ambitions of disrupting traffic through the canal by gaining control of the strategically important northern approaches to the suez canal
the pursuit by the anzac mounted division which ended at bir el abd on <num> august began the sinai and palestine campaign
thereafter the anzac mounted division supported by the imperial camel brigade were on the offensive pursuing the german and ottoman army many miles across the sinai peninsula reversing in a most emphatic manner the defeat suffered at katia three months earlier
from late april <year> after a german @-@ led ottoman force attacked british yeomanry at katia british empire forces in the region at first doubled from one brigade to two and then grew as rapidly as the developing infrastructure could support them
the construction of the railway and a water pipeline soon enabled an infantry division to join the light horse and mounted rifle brigades at romani
during the heat of summer regular mounted patrols and reconnaissance were carried out from their base at romani while the infantry constructed an extensive series of defensive redoubts
on <num> july the advance of a large german austrian and ottoman force across the northern sinai was reported
from <num> july until the battle began the australian 1st and <num> light horse brigades took turns pushing out to clash with the advancing hostile column
during the night of <num> <num> august <year> the advancing force including the german pasha i formation and the ottoman <num> infantry division launched an attack from katia on romani
forward troops quickly became engaged with the screen established by the 1st light horse brigade anzac mounted division
during fierce fighting before dawn on <num> august the australian light horsemen were forced to slowly retire
at daylight their line was reinforced by the <num> light horse brigade and about mid morning the <num> mounted brigade and the new zealand mounted rifles brigade joined the battle
together these four brigades of the anzac mounted division managed to contain and direct the determined attackers into deep sand
here the attackers came within range of the strongly entrenched <num> lowland division defending romani and the railway
coordinated resistance by all these eef formations the deep sand the heat and thirst prevailed and the german austrian and ottoman advance was checked
although the attacking force fought strongly to maintain its positions the next morning by nightfall they had been pushed back to their starting point at katia
the retiring force was pursued by the anzac mounted division between <num> and <num> august during which the ottomans and germans forces fought a number of strong rearguard actions against the advancing australian light horse british yeomanry and new zealand mounted rifle brigades
the pursuit ended on <num> august when the german and ottoman force abandoned their base at bir el abd and retreated back to el arish
in february <year> a german and ottoman force unsuccessfully attacked the suez canal
minor ottoman and bedouin forces operating across the sinai continued to threaten the canal from march through the gallipoli campaign until june when they practically ceased until the autumn
meanwhile the german and ottoman empires supported an uprising by the senussi a political @-@ religious group on the western frontier of egypt which began in november <year>
by february <year> however there was no apparent sign of any unusual military activity in the sinai itself when the british began construction on the first <num> @-@ mile <num> km stretch of <num> @-@ foot @-@ <num> @-@ inch <num>
<num> m standard gauge railway and water pipeline from kantara to romani and katia
reconnaissance aircraft of the royal flying corps and seaplanes of the royal naval air service found only small scattered ottoman forces in the sinai region and no sign of any major concentration of troops in southern palestine
by the end of march or early in april <year> the british presence in the sinai was growing <num> miles <num> km of track including sidings had been laid
between <num> march and <num> april the water sources at wady um muksheib moya harab and jifjafa along the central sinai route from southern palestine were destroyed
in <year> they had been used by the central group of about <num> @,@ <num> or <num> @,@ <num> ottoman soldiers who moved across the sinai desert to attack the suez canal at ismailia
without these wells and cisterns the central route could no longer be used by large forces
german general friedrich freiherr kress von kressenstein 's raiding force retaliated to this growing british presence by attacking the widely dispersed <num> mounted brigade on <num> april easter sunday and also st george 's day when yeomanry were surprised and overwhelmed at katia and oghratina east of romani
the mounted yeomanry brigade had been sent to guard the water pipeline and railway as they were being extended beyond the protection of the suez canal defences into the desert towards romani
in response to this attack the british empire presence in the region doubled
the next day the new zealand mounted rifles brigade and the <num> light horse brigade which had served dismounted during the gallipoli campaign of the australian major general harry chauvel 's anzac mounted division reoccupied the katia area unopposed
the infantry moved forward to romani between <num> may and <num> june <year>
the building of the railway and pipeline had not been greatly affected by the fighting on <num> april and by <num> april four trains a day were running regularly to the railhead manned by no
<num> railway company and the main line to romani was opened on <num> may
a second standard gauge railway line from romani to mahamdiyah on the mediterranean coast was completed by <num> june
but conditions on the ground were extreme after the middle of may and in particular from mid june to the end of july the heat in the sinai desert ranged from extreme to fierce when temperatures could be expected to be in the region of <num> ° f <num> ° c in the shade
the terrible heat was not as bad as the khamsin dust storms which blow once every <num> days for between a few hours and several days the air is turned into a haze of floating sand particles flung about by a strong hot southerly wind
no major ground operations were carried out during these midsummer months the ottoman garrisons in the sinai being scattered and out of reach of the british forces
but constant patrolling and reconnaissance were carried out from romani to ogratina to bir el abd and on <num> may to bir bayud <num> miles <num> km south @-@ east of romani on <num> may to bir salmana <num> miles <num> km east north @-@ east of romani by the new zealand mounted rifle brigade when they covered <num> kilometres <num> mi in <num> hours
these patrols concentrated on an area of great strategic importance to large military formations wishing to move across the sinai along the northern route
here water was freely available in a large area of oases which extends from dueidar <num> miles <num> km from kantara on the suez canal along the darb es sultani the old caravan route to salmana <num> miles <num> km away
between <num> and <num> june the last water source on the central route across the sinai peninsula was destroyed by the mukhsheib column
this column consisting of engineers and units of the <num> light horse brigade the bikaner camel corps and the egyptian camel transport corps drained <num> @,@ <num> @,@ <num> us gallons <num> @,@ <num> @,@ <num> l <num> @,@ <num> @,@ <num> imp gal of water from pools and cisterns in the wadi mukhsheib and sealed the cisterns
this action effectively narrowed the area in which ottoman offensives might be expected to the coastal or northern route across the sinai peninsula
ottoman aircraft attacked the suez canal twice during may dropping bombs on port said
british aircraft bombed the town and aerodrome at el arish on <num> may and <num> june and bombed all the ottoman camps on a front of <num> miles <num> km parallel to the canal on <num> may
by the middle of june the no
<num> australian squadron australian flying corps had begun active service with b flight at suez performing reconnaissance
on <num> july a flight was stationed at sherika in upper egypt with c flight based at kantara
kress von kressenstein 's fourth army was made up of the <num> anatolian infantry division 's three regiments the 31st <num> and <num> infantry regiments totalling <num> @,@ <num> men of whom <num> @,@ <num> to <num> @,@ <num> were combatants arab ancillary forces and one regiment of the camel corps
estimates of their arms range from <num> @,@ <num> to <num> @,@ <num> rifles <num> to <num> machine guns and two to five anti @-@ aircraft gun sections they also fielded four heavy artillery and mountain gun batteries <num> artillery pieces and the pasha i formation
nearly <num> @,@ <num> camels and <num> @,@ <num> horses accompanied the advance
the pasha i formation with a ration strength of about <num> @,@ <num> consisted of personnel and materiel for a machine gun battalion of eight companies with four guns each with ottoman drivers five anti @-@ aircraft groups the <num> battalion heavy artillery consisting of one battery of two <num> guns one battery of four <num> mm howitzers and two batteries of <num> mm howitzers two guns in each battery
the officers ncos and leading numbers of this artillery battalion were german the remainder were ottoman army personnel
in addition pasha i also included two trench mortar companies the <num> flight detachment wireless detachment three railway companies and two field hospitals
austria provided two mountain howitzer batteries of six guns each
with the exception of the two <num> mm howitzers the trench mortars and the railway personnel the remainder of pasha i took part in the advance to romani
the <num> flight detachment provided a squadron for aerial reconnaissance and increased the numbers of aircraft available to support the advance across sinai
these pasha i aircraft were faster and more effective than the hopelessly outclassed british aircraft and were able to maintain air superiority over the battleground
it is also possible that the 81st regiment of the <num> division advanced to bir el abd and took part in the defence of that place
the objectives of the german austrian and ottoman advance were to capture romani and to then establish a strongly entrenched position opposite kantara from which place their heavy artillery would be within range of the suez canal
the attacking force assembled in the southern ottoman empire at shellal north @-@ west of beersheba and departed for the sinai on <num> july <year> they reached bir el abd and ogratina ten days later
the role of this new force was to both defend the british protectorate of egypt and provide reinforcements for the western front
murray had his headquarters in cairo to better deal with his multiple responsibilities although he was at ismailia during the battle for romani
with the occupation of romani the area became part the northern or no
<num> sector of the suez canal defences which originally stretched along the canal from ferdan to port said
two further sectors grouped the defence forces along the central and southern sections of the canal no
<num> the central sector stretched south from ferdan to headquarters at ismailia and on to kabrit where the no
<num> or southern sector extended from kabrit to suez
murray considered it very unlikely that an attack would occur anywhere other than in the northern sector and therefore was prepared to reduce the troops in nos <num> and <num> sectors to a minimum
he decided not to reinforce his four infantry brigades but to increase the available fire @-@ power at romani by moving up the <num> and 161st machine gun companies of the <num> welsh and the <num> east anglian divisions
he also ordered the concentration of a small mobile column made up of the <num> light horse the city of london yeomanry less one squadron each with the <num> <num> and <num> companies of the imperial camel brigade in no
<num> sector
he calculated that the whole of the defensive force including the camel transport necessary to enable infantry in the <num> east lancashire division to advance into the desert would be fully equipped and the camels assembled by <num> august
approximately <num> @,@ <num> egyptian camel transport corps camels concentrated at romani prior to the battle
british monitors in the mediterranean sea off mahamdiyah got into position to shell the assembling ottoman force while an armoured train at kantara was ready to assist the defence of the right flank and all available aircraft were on standby at ismailia kantara port said and romani
major general h

stationed at kantara were infantry in the <num> division an infantry brigade of the <num> welsh division with <num> guns and the <num> light horse brigade detached from the anzac mounted division
lawrence moved two infantry battalions of the <num> division from no

the deployments on <num> august on and near the battlefield were as follows at hill <num> <num> miles <num> km from romani the new zealand mounted rifles brigade less the wellington mounted rifles regiment but with the <num> light horse brigade 's <num> light horse regiment temporarily attached commanded by edward chaytor and the <num> mounted brigade under the direct command of lawrence were joined on the railway by infantry in the <num> east lancashire brigade <num> division
together with the <num> light horse regiment attached to the new zealand mounted rifles brigade at dueidar to the east of hill <num> this force was to stop or delay von kressenstein 's attack should he attempt to bypass romani and advance directly towards the suez canal at hill <num> infantry from the <num> lancashire fusiliers brigade and the <num> manchester brigade <num> division were also on the railway line at gilban station the mobile column was based in the sinai at the end of the el ferdan railway while the <num> light horse brigade was at ballybunion also in the sinai at the end of the ballah railway

the infantry occupied a defensive position known as wellington ridge facing a tangle of sand dunes
the area favoured defence sand dunes stretching about <num> miles <num>
<num> km inland covered an area of <num> square miles <num> km2 including to the south of romani the northern route from el arish
on the southern and south eastern edges a series of dunes of shifting sand with narrow sloping lanes led to a tableland of deep soft sand
the <num> lowland division developed a strong defensive position at romani which had its left flank on the mediterranean sea here a series of redoubts were built running southwards from mahamdiyah along the line of high sand hills about <num> miles <num> km to a dune known as katib gannit <num> feet <num> m high
this line of sand hills which were high enough to see katia oasis from marked the eastern edge of an area of very soft and shifting sand beyond which were lower dunes and harder sand where movement by both infantry and mounted forces was considerably easier
between the shore at the western end of the bardawil lagoon and katib gannit the principal tactical point on the eastern slopes of the romani heights the infantry constructed a line of <num> redoubts about <num> yards <num> m apart with a second series of redoubts covering the romani railway station and the right of the defensive position which curved like a hook westward then northward
a total of <num> redoubts were constructed which when fully garrisoned held from <num> to <num> rifles each with lewis guns and an average of two vickers machine guns allotted to each position they were well wired on the right side of each of the positions although there was no wire between the redoubts
this defensive line was supported by artillery
the threat of an ottoman attack towards the suez canal had been considered by lawrence in consultation with his divisional commanders and a second defensive area was developed to address their concerns
their plans took into account the possibility of an ottoman army at katia moving to attack romani or following the old caravan route to assault hill <num> and dueidar on their way to the suez canal
any attempt to bypass romani on the right flank would be open to attack from the garrison which could send out infantry and mounted troops on the hard ground in the plain to the south @-@ west
the new zealand mounted rifle brigade was stationed at hill <num> at the end of june and the <num> light horse regiment at dueidar to prevent such an ottoman force from reaching the suez canal
the nearest ottoman garrison of <num> @,@ <num> men was at bir el mazar <num> miles <num> km east of romani and on <num> july a patrol found bir salmana unoccupied
however greatly increased aerial activity over the romani area began about <num> july when faster and better @-@ climbing german aircraft quickly established superiority over british aircraft
but they could not stop british aircraft from continuing to reconnoitre the country to the east and on <num> july a british aircraft with brigadier general e

chaytor commander of the new zealand mounted rifles brigade acting as observer discovered an ottoman force of about <num> @,@ <num> at bir bayud
a slightly smaller force was detected at gameil and another similar sized force was found at bir el abd with about <num> @,@ <num> camels seen at the camps or moving between bir el abd and bir salmana
the next morning <num> @,@ <num> men were found to be entrenched at mageibra with an advance depot for supplies and stores at bir el abd
a small force was spotted as far forward as the oasis of oghratina which by the next day <num> july had grown to <num> @,@ <num> men
on <num> july the <num> light horse brigade with two guns mounted on ped @-@ rails of the ayrshire battery demonstrated against oghratina capturing several prisoners and beginning a series of patrols which together with the 1st light horse brigade they continued until the eve of battle
every day until <num> august these two brigades alternated riding out from their base at romani towards katia at about <num> <num> and bivouacking until dawn at which time they advanced on a wide front until german or ottoman fire was provoked
if the enemy position was weak the light horse pushed forward and if a counterattack began the brigade retired slowly thereafter to return to camp at romani at nightfall
the following day the other brigade carried out similar manoeuvres in the direction of katia and the advancing ottoman columns picking up the officers patrols which had been left out during the night to monitor enemy movements
during this period one of many clashes occurred on <num> july at hod um ugba <num> miles <num>
<num> km from the british line
two squadrons of the wellington mounted rifle regiment commanded by lieutenant colonel w
meldrum made a bayonet assault supported by several machine guns and two <num> @-@ pounder guns
they drove the ottomans from the hod leaving <num> dead and taking eight prisoners from the ottoman 31st infantry regiment
the tactic of continuous forward patrolling was so successful that the advancing force 's every move was known to the defenders but the light horsemen were substantially outnumbered and could not stop the advance
by daylight on <num> august the german austrian and ottoman force had occupied katia and were within striking distance of romani dueidar hill <num> and the suez canal
their line ran north @-@ east and south @-@ west from the bardawil lagoon to east of katia with their left flank thrown well forward
kress von kressenstein 's plan for the attack on romani was to bombard the line of defensive redoubts with heavy artillery and employ only weak infantry detachments against them while his main force launched attacks against the right and rear of the romani position
the defenders expected the german and ottoman attack to be one of containment against their prepared line of defence and an all @-@ out attack on the right south of katib gannit
they also appreciated that such an attack would expose the german and ottoman left flank
murray 's plan was to firstly delay the attackers and make it very difficult for them to gain ground south of katib gannit and secondly only when the german and ottoman force was totally committed to then disorganise their flank attack with an attack by section troops at hill <num> and dueidar with the <num> light horse brigade and the mobile column operating more widely against the flank and rear
chauvel had selected a position for the defence of romani which stretched for <num> miles <num>
<num> km between katib gannit and hod el enna with a second fall @-@ back position covering a series of parallel gullies running south @-@ east and north @-@ west giving access to the area of soft sand to the rear of the romani defences
no visible works were constructed but together with chauvel the commanders of the two light horse brigades whose task it would be to hold the attackers on this ground until the flank attack could begin studied the area closely
in addition to the usual officers patrols left out overnight to monitor the enemy 's positions chauvel decided to leave out for the night the whole of the 1st light horse brigade to hold an outpost line of about <num> miles <num>
<num> km covering all entrances to the sandhill plateau which formed the romani position and which were not protected by infantry posts
a shot or two fired out in the desert to the south @-@ east of their position put the long piquet line of the 1st and <num> light horse regiment 1st light horse brigade on alert about midnight when the <num> light horse regiment 1st light horse brigade was called up to the front line
the austrian german and ottoman advance paused after finding the gullies held by the light horsemen but at about <num> <num> a sudden heavy burst of fire along the whole front began the attack of the considerably superior ottoman and german forces and by <num> <num> they had in many places advanced to within <num> yards <num> m of the australian line
the ottoman centre and left columns were skilfully led round the open flank of the infantry 's entrenchments and on towards the camp and railway
after the moon had set at around <num> <num> the germans and ottomans made a bayonet charge on mount meredith
although vastly outnumbered the light horsemen fought an effective delaying action at close quarters but were forced to relinquish ground slowly and to ultimately evacuate the position by <num> <num>
without the benefit of moon light the light horsemen had fired at the flashes of the enemy 's rifles until they were close enough to use bayonets
the 1st light horse brigade was eventually forced back withdrawing slowly troop covering troop with steady accurate fire staving off a general attack with the bayonet to their fall @-@ back position a large east west sand dune called wellington ridge at the southern edge of the romani encampment
during the retirement to wellington ridge the covering squadrons on the left near katib gannit were also attacked as was the squadron on the right which was taken in the flank and suffered considerable loss but managed to hold its ground until the position in its rear was occupied
by <num> <num> all light horsemen south of mount meredith had been forced back to their led horses and had succeeded in disengaging and falling back to their second position
soon after an ottoman machine gun was shooting down on the light horse from mount meredith
chauvel had relied on the steadiness of the 1st light horse brigade which he had commanded during the gallipoli campaign to hold the line against greatly superior numbers for four hours until dawn when the general situation could be assessed
daylight revealed the weakness of the light horse defenders in their second position on wellington ridge and that their right was outflanked by strong german and ottoman forces
at <num> <num> the <num> light horse brigade commanded by colonel j
r
royston was ordered up by chauvel from etmaler and went into action in front of mount royston to support and prolong the 1st light horse brigade 's right flank by moving up the <num> and <num> light horse regiments into the front line
german austrian or ottoman artillery now opened fire on the infantry defences and camps in the rear shrapnel inflicted some losses but the high explosive shells were smothered by the soft sand
the attackers succeeded in forcing the light horse off wellington ridge which placed them within <num> metres <num> @,@ <num> ft of the romani camp
however they were unable to press further as they now became exposed to machine gun and rifle fire from the entrenched infantry of the <num> lowland division and shelling from the horse artillery supporting the light horsemen 's determined defence
having been held south of romani the german and ottoman force attempted a further outflanking manoeuvre to the west concentrating <num> @,@ <num> troops around mount royston another sand dune south @-@ west of romani
at <num> <num> the ottoman 31st infantry regiment pushed forward then the <num> and the <num> infantry regiments swung around the left and into the british rear
this outflanking movement was steadily progressing along the slopes of mount royston and turning the right of the <num> light horse brigade whose third regiment the wellington mounted rifles was now also committed to the front line
the two brigades of light horse continued to gradually withdraw pivoting on the extreme right of the infantry position which covered the left flank and rear of romani
they were pushed back between wellington ridge and mount royston about <num>
<num> miles <num>
<num> km west of the former the attackers continually forcing back their right flank
between <num> <num> and <num> <num> they were compelled to also retire slowly from this ridge although the <num> and <num> light horse regiment <num> light horse brigade still held the western edge
at <num> <num> meredith was ordered to withdraw the 1st light horse brigade behind the line occupied by the <num> light horse regiment north of etmaler camp
at <num> <num> the <num> and <num> light horse regiments retired squadron by squadron from the remainder of wellington ridge
by about <num> <num> german austrian and ottoman fire from the ridge top was directed into the camp only a few hundred yards away but the ayrshire and leicester batteries quickly stopped this artillery attack
it became apparent that the german and ottoman right column 31st infantry regiment was attempting a frontal attack on redoubts held by infantry in the <num> lowland division
the defenders were able to hold on but were subjected to severe artillery shelling during the day
frontal attacks began with heavy german or austrian fire by their artillery which attempted to breach the infantry defensive line
about <num> <num> attacks were being made on numbers <num> and <num> redoubts which began with heavy artillery fire but the attacks broke completely when the 31st ottoman infantry regiment were within <num> yards <num> m of no
<num> redoubt subsequent attempts were less successful
at about <num> <num> chauvel contacted brigadier general e
s
girdwood commanding <num> infantry brigade requesting his brigade temporarily relieve the light horse brigades until they had watered their horses in preparation for a mounted counterattack
girdwood refused because his brigade was being held in reserve to support an intended attack eastward by infantry in the <num> lowland division
the light horse had gradually withdrawn back until at about <num> <num> the main german and ottoman attack was stopped by well directed fire from the royal horse artillery batteries of the anzac mounted division and by light horse rifle and machine gun fire to which the <num> lowland division contributed considerable firepower
the attackers appeared to have exhausted themselves but they held their ground while austrian and ottoman artillery of various calibres including <num>
<num> and <num>
<num> cm guns fired on the defenders and their camps and german and ottoman aircraft severely bombed the defenders
the three columns of the german austrian and ottoman attacking force were brought to a standstill by the coordinated concerted and determined defence of the 1st and <num> light horse brigades and the <num> lowland division
the ottoman advance was at a standstill everywhere
after a long night 's march the german and ottoman troops faced a difficult day under the desert sun without being able to replenish their water and exposed to artillery fire from romani
at this time the attacking forces held a line running from the bardawil on the mediterranean coast southward along the front of the <num> infantry division 's entrenchments and then westward through and including the very large sand dunes of mount meredith and mount royston
but from their position on mount royston the german austrian and ottoman force dominated the camp area of romani and threatened the railway line
by <num> <num> lawrence at his headquarters of the northern no
<num> canal defences sector at kantara had been informed of the developing attack
he recognised that the main blow was falling on romani and ordered the <num> mounted yeomanry brigade at hill <num> to move towards mount royston
they were led by a composite regiment which moved off at once the remainder of the brigade preparing to follow
at <num> <num> lawrence ordered the new zealand mounted rifle brigade consisting of brigade headquarters and the canterbury mounted rifle regiment less the auckland mounted rifles and the attached <num> light horse regiments <num> light horse brigade to move towards mount royston via dueidar and there pick up the auckland mounted rifles regiment
the yeomanry and new zealand brigades had both been stationed at hill <num> <num> miles <num> km from romani when their orders to move were received
the new zealanders were to operate vigorously so as to cut off the enemy who appears to have got round the right of the anzac mounted division
meanwhile the <num> light horse brigade at ballybunion was directed to move forward to hill <num> and send one regiment to dueidar while the mobile column was ordered by ghq to march towards mageibra
at <num> <num> the front held by the two light horse brigades faced south from a point <num> yards <num> m northwest of no
<num> redoubt north of wellington ridge to the sand hills north of mount royston
as the line had fallen back the <num> and <num> light horse regiments 1st light horse brigade had come in between the <num> and <num> light horse regiments <num> light horse brigade from right to left the line was now held by the <num> <num> <num> and <num> light horse and the wellington mounted rifles regiments while <num> mile <num>
<num> km north north @-@ west of mount royston d squadron of the royal gloucestershire hussars a regiment in the <num> mounted brigade held its ground
the plan called for the 1st and <num> light horse brigades the <num> mounted and the new zealand mounted rifles brigades to swing round the attackers left flank and envelop them
the first reinforcements to arrive were the composite regiment of the <num> mounted brigade they came up on the flank of their mounted regiment the royal gloucestershire hussars d squadron <num> @,@ <num> yards <num> @,@ <num> m west of mount royston which was being attacked by a strong body of ottoman soldiers
the regiment attacked the ottomans in enfilade and forced them back
when the new zealand mounted rifles brigade 's headquarters and the canterbury mounted rifle regiments were within <num> mile <num>
<num> km of dueidar on the old caravan road they were ordered to move directly to canterbury hill the last defensible position in front of the railway east of pelusium station as the strong german and ottoman attack was threatening to take the railway and romani
the auckland mounted rifles regiment arrived with its brigade between <num> <num> and <num> <num> to find the composite yeomanry regiment <num> mounted yeomanry brigade in contact with the german and ottoman forces on the south @-@ west side of mount royston
the 1st and <num> light horse brigades first made contact with the new zealand mounted rifles brigade by heliograph after which royston commanding the <num> light horse brigade galloped across to explain the situation
chaytor then moved the auckland and canterbury mounted rifles regiments supported by the somerset battery onto high ground between the right of the light horse and the yeomanry which was shortly afterwards joined by the remainder of the <num> mounted brigade under the command of brigadier general wiggin
at the most critical period of the day 's fighting when the german and ottoman force of <num> @,@ <num> dominated the romani area from mount royston the five mounted brigades still less the <num> light horse regiment began their counterattack at <num> <num> from the west towards mount royston
the new zealand riflemen soon gained a footing on mount royston aided by accurate and rapid shooting from the somerset royal horse artillery battery
by <num> <num> the attack had proceeded to a point where chaytor arranged with the <num> mounted brigade for a squadron of royal gloucestershire hussars and two troops of the worcestershire yeomanry to gallop against the southern spur of mount royston
they easily took the spur the defenders not waiting for the onslaught of the mounted charge
from the crest of the spur the gloucestershire squadron shot down the horse teams of an austrian german or ottoman battery of pack guns concentrated in the hollow behind the spur and the attacking force began to surrender
the new zealand mounted rifle and <num> mounted brigades were supported by leading infantry battalions of the <num> manchester brigade which had just arrived when ottoman and german soldiers began to surrender en masse
at about <num> <num> <num> prisoners two machine guns and the pack battery were captured and the outer flank of the attacking force was completely routed
meanwhile the inner flank of the german and ottoman force on wellington ridge made a last effort to advance across the ridge but was driven back by artillery fire
fresh frontal attacks launched against the main british infantry system of redoubts broke down completely
at <num> <num> major general smith ordered infantry in the <num> scottish rifles brigade to attack the enemy force on wellington ridge on the left of the light horse and in coordination with the counterattack on mount royston
an artillery bombardment of wellington ridge began at <num> <num>
just before <num> <num> infantry in the <num> and <num> cameronians scottish rifles moved south from behind no
<num> redoubt the <num> scottish rifles advancing to within <num> yards <num> m of the crest of wellington ridge before being stopped by heavy rifle fire
when darkness put an end to the fighting the 1st and <num> light horse brigades established an outpost line and spent the night on the battlefield while the new zealand mounted rifles and <num> mounted brigades withdrew for water and rations at pelusium station where the newly arrived infantry brigades of the <num> division were assembling
the <num> light horse brigade halted at hill <num> while the mobile force had reached the hod el bada <num> miles <num> km south of romani station
at <num> <num> when the new zealand mounted rifle and <num> mounted brigades moved from the positions they had won to water and rest at pelusium the area was consolidated by infantry in the <num> manchester brigade <num> division
brigadier general girdwood ordered infantry in the <num> and <num> scottish rifles battalions to hold their ground on wellington ridge until daylight but to keep close contact with the enemy during the night in the hope of capturing large numbers of tired and disorganised soldiers in the morning
approximately <num> @,@ <num> unwounded prisoners were captured during the day and sent to the pelusium railway station
this force included the two infantry divisions – the <num> and the newly arrived <num> – four mounted brigades two of which had been on active duty since <num> july and two heavily engaged on the front line the day before and may have included the <num> light horse brigade although it was still at hill <num> and the mobile column at hod el bada
at this time command of the <num> mounted brigade passed from the anzac mounted division to the infantry division the <num> division it being suggested that orders required the anzac mounted division to remain in position and that the <num> light horse brigade alone was to make a flank attack
however lawrence 's orders for a general advance on <num> august beginning at <num> <num> included an advance by the anzac mounted division
his orders read anzac mounted division to press forward with its right on the hod el enna and its left in close touch with the infantry from the <num> scottish rifles brigade <num> lowland division advancing on the line katib gannit to mount meredith
<num> light horse brigade to move towards bir el nuss and attack hod el enna from the south keeping in close touch with the anzac mounted division
<num> mounted brigade under orders of <num> infantry division to assist the <num> light horse brigade 's link with the anzac mounted division 's right
<num> division to move on the line canterbury hill – mount royston – hod el enna and drive back any opposition to the advance of the mounted troops in close support of anzac mounted division 's right flank
<num> lowland division to move in close support of anzac mounted division 's left flank towards mount meredith and to prepare for a general advance towards abu hamra which was not to be undertaken until further orders from lawrence at no
<num> section headquarters
meanwhile the german austrian and ottoman force was now spread from hill <num> almost to bir en nuss but with their left flank unprotected
they could not have been in good shape after fighting all the previous day in intense midsummer heat and having to remain in position overnight far from water and harassed by british infantry
their situation was now precarious as their main attacking force was well past the right of the main british infantry positions infantry in the <num> lowland division was closer to the nearest enemy @-@ controlled water source at katia than most of the attacking force
had the british infantry left their trenches promptly and attacked in a south easterly direction von kressenstein 's force would have had great difficulty escaping
the wellington mounted rifle regiment with the <num> light horse regiment and supported on the left by scottish rifles infantry posts fixed bayonets and stormed wellington ridge
they encountered heavy rifle and machine gun fire but rushed up the sandy slope and quickly broke through the german and ottoman front line
after clearing wellington ridge the mounted riflemen light horsemen and infantrymen pressed forward from ridge to ridge without pause
these troops swept down on a body of about <num> @,@ <num> to <num> @,@ <num> ottoman soldiers who became demoralised
as a result of this attack a white flag was hoisted and by <num> <num> the german and ottoman soldiers who had stubbornly defended their positions on wellington ridge dominating the camps at romani were captured
a total of <num> @,@ <num> became prisoners in the neighbourhood of wellington ridge <num> soldiers surrendered to infantry in the <num> scottish rifles alone while others were captured by the light horse and mounted rifles regiments
by <num> <num> the main german and ottoman force was in a disorganised retreat towards katia with the 1st and <num> light horse brigades and the ayrshire and leicestershire batteries not far behind
at <num> <num> a further <num> men surrendered to the infantry in no
<num> redoubt while these prisoners were being dealt with it became apparent that they were part of a rearguard and that a full retreat was under way
at <num> <num> lawrence ordered chauvel to take command of all troops and to initiate a vigorous general advance eastwards
the <num> division was ordered to advance to hod el enna their <num> manchester brigade marched out at <num> <num> and reached hod el enna between <num> <num> and <num> <num> while their <num> lancashire fusiliers brigade arrived at <num> <num>
they were supported by the egyptian camel transport corps which worked with the army service corps to supply them with drinking water
in much distress in the scorching midsummer sands infantry in the <num> division marched very slowly and far in the rear
the <num> lowland division also experienced difficulties although lawrence ordered the division to move at <num> <num> the men did not leave their trenches until nearly midday reaching their objective of abu hamra late in the evening
as a result kress von kressenstein was able to extricate most of his troops and heavy guns from the immediate battle area during the day
although it has been stated that british reserves hammered the germans and ottomans to a halt on <num> august it appears one of the infantry divisions was reluctant to leave their defences neither infantry division were trained in desert warfare and found the sand dunes extremely difficult to negotiate
they could not match the pace and endurance of the well @-@ trained german and ottoman force and were hampered by water supply problems
at <num> <num> when lawrence ordered chauvel to take command of all mounted troops excluding the mobile column the new zealand mounted rifles the <num> mounted and the <num> light horse brigades were somewhat scattered
by <num> <num> the new zealand mounted rifles brigade had reached bir en nuss there they found the <num> light horse brigade which had been ordered to move first on hamisah and then left towards katia to cooperate in a general attack
the advance guard moved to fulfill these orders at <num> <num>
at <num> <num> the general mounted advance began and by midday was on a line from west of bir nagid to south of katib gannit in the centre the new zealand mounted rifles brigade were approaching the south @-@ west edge of the katia oasis on their left the 1st the <num> light horse the <num> mounted brigades and infantry in the <num> lowland division were attacking abu hamra to the north of the old caravan road while the <num> light horse brigade was away to the new zealander 's right south of the old caravan road attacking german and ottoman units at bir el hamisah
between <num> <num> and <num> <num> the commanders of the new zealand mounted rifle 1st and <num> light horse and <num> mounted brigades reconnoitred the german austrian and ottoman rearguard position <num> miles <num>
<num> km west of katia
it was decided that the three light horse brigades would advance mounted with the yeomanry to attack the german and ottoman right flank
the rearguard force made a very determined stand on a well @-@ prepared line stretching from bir el hamisah to katia and on to abu hamra
their artillery and machine guns were well placed in the palms fringing the eastern side of a great flat marsh which stretched right across the front of their position giving them an excellent field of fire
a general mounted attack commenced at <num> <num>
by <num> <num> the new zealand mounted rifles brigade and the 1st and <num> light horse brigades were advancing at the gallop on katia
when they had reached the edge of the white gypsum the light horse and mounted rifle brigades formed a line fixed bayonets and charged over the exposed country
they galloped in a long line of charging horses through shell fire and bullets holding fixed bayonets
on the far left the intensity of fire from the rearguard made it necessary for the <num> mounted brigade of sword carrying yeomanry to send back their horses and advance dismounted
while all the brigades which charged were eventually forced to attack dismounted also when the ground became too swampy
they were met by well @-@ directed heavy german austrian and ottoman artillery fire which completely outgunned the supporting ayrshire and somerset batteries by sunset the advance of the british empire mounted brigades had been stopped
the <num> light horse regiment <num> light horse brigade on the extreme right was held up by a determined german and ottoman rearguard and was unable to work round the right flank of that position
but after galloping to within a few hundred yards of the rearguard 's line they made a dismounted bayonet attack under cover of machine gun fire and the inverness battery
as a result the german and ottoman force abandoned their position leaving <num> men and seven machine guns to be captured
but instead of holding their ground they drew off and this withdrawal led to a strong german and ottoman counterattack falling on the canterbury mounted rifle regiment
darkness finally put an end to the battle
during the night the germans austrians and ottomans withdrew back to oghrantina while the anzac mounted division watered at romani leaving a troop of the auckland mounted rifle regiment as a listening post on the battlefield
the two @-@ day battle for romani and the suez canal had been won by the british infantry and australian british and new zealand mounted troops
they captured approximately <num> @,@ <num> german and ottoman combatants and killed more than <num> @,@ <num> but the main enemy force was able to escape with all their artillery except for one captured battery and retreat back to oghratina after fighting a successful rearguard action at katia
having borne the burden of the long days of patrolling reconnaissance and minor engagements with the advancing austrian german and ottoman columns prior to the battle the 1st and <num> light horse brigades had alone withstood the attack from midnight on <num> <num> august until dawn on <num> august as well as continuing to fight during the long days of battle
by the end of <num> august they were completely exhausted their depleted ranks stumbled back to their bivouac lines at romani and etmaler where they were ordered one day 's rest
during the night of <num> <num> august infantry in the <num> south scottish brigade and <num> highland light infantry brigade were at abu hamra the <num> manchester brigade <num> division at hod el enna the <num> lancashire fusiliers brigade <num> division on its left in touch with the <num> scottish rifles brigade <num> division which had its left on redoubt no
<num>
the next morning infantry in the <num> division was ordered to advance eastwards at <num> <num> and occupy a line from bir el mamluk to bir katia while the <num> lowland division was to advance from abu hamra and prolong the infantry line of the <num> division to the north @-@ east
although they carried out their orders during their two @-@ day march from pelusium station to katia infantry in the <num> manchester brigade lost <num> men victims to thirst and the sun other infantry brigades suffered similarly
it became clear that the infantry could not go on and they ceased to be employed in the advance
indeed it was necessary for the bikanir camel corps and yeomanry detachments as well as the medical services to search the desert for those who had been left behind
the mobile column in the south consisting of the imperial camel brigade the <num> light horse and the mounted city of london yeomanry regiments less two squadrons advanced from ferdan and the ballah railhead to attack the german and ottoman left flank working through bir el mageibra bir el aweidia and hod el bayud
they found mageibra evacuated on <num> august
after camping there for the night they fought strong hostile forces between bayud and mageibra the following day but could make no impression
some days later on <num> august the mobile column did succeed in getting round the ottoman flank but was too weak to have any effect and retired to bir bayud
the new zealand mounted rifles brigades and the <num> mounted brigade were ordered to capture oghratina
despite attempts by these two brigades to turn the enemy flank they were forced to make a frontal attack on strongly entrenched rearguards in positions which favoured the defenders and which were supported by carefully positioned artillery
meanwhile the two infantry divisions moved to garrison katia and abu hamra and lawrence moved his headquarters forward from kantara to romani
the <num> light horse brigade on the right advanced towards badieh but could only make small progress against positions securely held by german and ottoman forces
the new zealand mounted rifles brigade had moved out at dawn followed by the <num> mounted brigade without ambulance support as the new zealand field ambulance had not returned from romani and the <num> mounted field ambulance had not yet arrived
fortunately casualties were light and both ambulances arrived in the evening
the <num> light horse field ambulance had formed a dressing station at bir nagid to the south of romani treating wounded from <num> light horse brigade 's engagement at bir el hamisah a convoy brought in wounded ottomans from a hod to the south of romani and <num> cases of heat exhaustion from infantry in the <num> division were treated during the day
lacking the support of infantry or heavy artillery the mounted force was too small to capture this strong rearguard position but the threat from the mounted advance was enough to force the hostile force to evacuate the position
during the night the german and ottoman forces retreated back to bir el abd where they had been three weeks before on <num> july when they established a base with a depot for supplies and stores
on <num> august the greater bairam a feast day celebrating the end of the islamic year coincided with the egyptian camel transport corps at romani being ordered to move out with supplies for the advancing troops but <num> men most of whom were past the end of their contracts and entitled to be discharged refused orders to fill their water bottles draw their rations and saddle up
one man was hit about the head with the butt of a pistol and the dissenters were dispersed into small groups and reassigned to various units in the infantry division the <num> lowland division
as the <num> light horse brigade came up they passed many dead ottomans and yeomanry one dead ottoman sniper had a heap of hundreds of rounds of empty cartridge shells beside him
meanwhile the bikanir camel corps and a squadron of aircraft continued searching the desert sands for missing men
the position was strongly held by greatly superior numbers of germans austrians and ottomans supported by well @-@ placed artillery but the garrison was seen burning stores and evacuating camps
chauvel deployed the anzac mounted division for the advance with the new zealand mounted rifles brigade in the centre following the telegraph line
on their right with a gap of <num> mile <num>
<num> km was the <num> light horse brigade which was in touch with a small flying column the mobile column of the city of london yeomanry <num> light horse regiments and the imperial camel brigade which was to again attempt to get round the german and ottoman left flank and cut off their retreat
the advance of the <num> light horse and the new zealand mounted brigades from oghratina to bir el abd was to begin at daylight on <num> august with the <num> mounted brigade forming the reserve
on the left of the new zealanders royston 's column a composite of the depleted 1st and <num> light horse brigades had gone to katia to water and had then march through the night to the hod hamada <num> miles <num>
<num> km north @-@ west of bir el abd where they arrived at <num> <num> on <num> august
they were to bivouaced for one and a half hours before advancing to a point <num> miles <num>
<num> km north @-@ east of bir el abd to cooperate with the new zealand mounted rifles brigade 's attack on the rearguard position at <num> <num>
since the attack supported by only four horse artillery batteries was on a prepared position held in superior strength strong in machine guns and covered by double the number of guns including heavy howitzers it was something of a gamble
the attacking force 's only advantage was its mobility
by <num> <num> they had driven in enemy outposts and reached high ground overlooking bir el abd
royston 's column moved off at <num> <num> with the intention of enveloping the ottoman right while the new zealanders attacked in the centre the four brigades covering a front of <num> miles <num>
<num> km
the forward troops of the german and ottoman rearguard which held a front of about <num> miles <num> km were driven back to bir el abd by the new zealanders
at this time the attackers appeared likely to succeed as they had firmly established themselves across the telegraph line and the old caravan road supported by the somerset and leicester batteries
but the german austrian and ottoman rearguard quickly realised how thin the attacking line was and at <num> <num> advanced out of their trenches to counterattack
this aggressive move was only checked by artillery fire from the somerset battery effectively combined with fire from machine guns
the subsequent fire fight made it extremely difficult for the mounted riflemen to maintain their position and on the flanks the light horse were also held up
the german and ottoman infantry renewed their attack towards a gap between the new zealanders and the <num> light horse brigade but the <num> light horse regiment covered the gap and the german and ottoman advance was halted
chauvel ordered the <num> light horse brigade which had been unable to turn the german and ottoman flank to move towards the new zealanders who renewed their efforts but they only succeeded in exposing their flanks as the australians were unable to conform to their forward movement
by <num> <num> all progress had stopped
the new zealand mounted rifles brigade continued to hold on in the centre while both flanks were bent back by pressure from the strong german and ottoman force
the result was that the new zealanders ended up holding a very exposed salient line on the forward slopes of the hills overlooking the hod
fresh german or ottoman reinforcements from el arish then launched a fierce counterattack on a front of about <num>
<num> miles <num>
<num> km on the centre
this fell on the canterbury and auckland regiments and a squadron of warwickshire yeomanry of the <num> mounted brigade under chaytor 's command
the new zealanders were supported by machine guns one section attached to the canterbury mounted rifles regiment fired all their guns directly on the advancing soldiers stopping them when they were within <num> yards <num> m of the new zealand position
by midday the advance had been completely held up by determined counterattacks supported by fresh german or ottoman troops from el arish
even more than at katia on <num> august these soldiers were more numerous ready full of fight and more strongly supported by well @-@ placed austrian and ottoman guns delivering both heavy and accurate fire
at this time the rearguard launched another heavy counterattack with two columns of <num> @,@ <num> and <num> @,@ <num> german and ottoman soldiers against the canterbury and auckland regiments and the squadron of the warwickshire yeomanry
by <num> <num> the attack had extended to the mounted force 's left flank where the ayrshire battery with royston 's column was badly cut up by this fire losing <num> horses killed and making it extremely difficulty to move the guns
they were forced to retire nearly <num> mile <num>
<num> km and the <num> light horse brigade after advancing well up on the right flank was also forced to give ground by the accuracy of enemy shellfire
a further withdrawal by the <num> light horse brigade made the new zealand mounted rifles brigade 's position critical and at <num> <num> chauvel gave orders for a general retirement
disengagement proved to be a challenge it was only the tenacity of the new zealanders and nightfall which saved them from certain capture
at the last the machine gun squadron had all its guns in line some of them firing at a range of <num> yards <num> m they were supported by squadrons of the <num> mounted brigade which together successfully covered the new zealanders withdrawal
after this day of fierce fighting which has been described as the hardest @-@ fought action of the whole sinai campaign the anzac mounted division 's advance was effectively stopped
chauvel ordered the division to return to water at oghratina despite lawrence 's wish for them to bivouac close to bir el abd but chauvel concluded that his force was in no condition to remain within reach of this strong and aggressive enemy force
further the anzac mounted division had lost a significant proportion of their strength over <num> casualties including eight officers and <num> other ranks killed
no serious fighting took place on <num> august but von kressenstein 's force at bir el abd was watched and harassed and plans were made for an attack on <num> august
the advance of the anzac mounted division began at daylight but soon afterwards forward patrols reported that the garrison at bir el abd was retiring
the mounted force followed the austrians germans and ottomans as far as salmana where another rearguard action delayed the mounted force as the enemy withdrawal continued back to el arish
the anzac mounted division 's lines of communication were now fully extended and the difficulties of supplying the mounted troops from romani made it impossible for the british empire mounted force to consider any further advance at that time
arrangements were made to hold and garrison the country decisively won by this series of indecisive engagements from katia eastwards to bir el abd
von kressenstein succeeded in withdrawing his battered force from a potentially fatal situation both his advance to romani and the withdrawal were remarkable achievements of planning leadership staff work and endurance
ottoman army casualties have been estimated to have been <num> @,@ <num> <num> @,@ <num> were buried after the battle and <num> @,@ <num> were taken prisoner
casualties were cared for by medical officers stretcher bearers camel drivers and sand @-@ cart drivers who worked tirelessly often in the firing line covering enormous distances in difficult conditions and doing all they could to relieve the suffering of the wounded
the casualties were transported on cacolets on camels or in sand @-@ carts back to the field ambulances as the heavy sand made it impossible to use motor- or horse @-@ drawn ambulances
between <num> and <num> august the anzac mounted division 's five field ambulances brought in <num> @,@ <num> patients including <num> enemy wounded
the evacuation by train from romani was carried out in a manner which caused much suffering and shock to the wounded
it was not effected till the night of august <num> – the transport of prisoners of war being given precedence over that of the wounded – and only open trucks without straw were available
the military exigencies necessitated shunting and much delay so that five hours were occupied on the journey of twenty @-@ five miles
it seemed a cruel shame to shunt a train full of wounded in open trucks but it had to be done
every bump in our springless train was extremely painful
in the absence of orders coordinating evacuation from the field ambulances the assistant director of medical services adms made their own arrangements
the adms anzac mounted division arranged with his counterparts in the two infantry divisions to set up a clearing station at the railhead <num> miles <num>
<num> km beyond romani
this station was formed from medical units of the anzac mounted the <num> and the <num> lowland divisions
with no orders from no
<num> section headquarters as to the method of evacuation of casualties of the three divisions prisoners of war were transported back to kantara by train before the wounded generating amongst all ranks a feeling of resentment and distrust towards the higher command which lasted for a long time
it occurred at a time when the allied nations had experienced nothing but defeat in france at salonika and at the capitulation of kut in mesopotamia
the battle has been widely acknowledged as a strategic victory and a turning point in the campaign to restore egypt 's territorial integrity and security and marked the end of the land campaign against the suez canal
romani was the first decisive victory attained by british land forces and changed the whole face of the campaign in that theatre wresting as it did from the enemy the initiative which he never again obtained
it also made the clearing of his troops from egyptian territory a feasible proposition
this series of successful british infantry and mounted operations resulted in the complete defeat of the <num> @,@ <num> to <num> @,@ <num> strong german austrian and ottoman force about half of whom were killed or wounded and nearly <num> @,@ <num> taken prisoner
also captured were a mountain gun battery of four heavy guns nine machine guns a complete camel @-@ pack machine gun company <num> @,@ <num> rifles and a million rounds of ammunition two complete field hospitals with all instruments fittings and drugs while a great quantity of stores in the supply depot at bir el abd was destroyed
all the captured arms and equipment were made in germany and the camel @-@ pack machine gun company 's equipment had been especially designed for desert warfare
many of the rifles were of the latest pattern and made of rustless steel
murray estimated the total german and ottoman casualties at about <num> @,@ <num> while a german estimate put the loss at one third of the force <num> @,@ <num> to <num> @,@ <num> which seems low considering the number of prisoners
the tactics employed by the anzac mounted division were to prove effective throughout the coming campaigns in the sinai and in the levant also known at the time as palestine
the key to the mounted rifles and light horse 's approach was to quickly move onto tactical ground and then to effectively operate as infantry once dismounted
in defence the artillery and machine guns wrought havoc on enemy attacks and during the mounted advance they covered and supported the british empire mounted force
this battle was fought under extreme conditions in the sinai desert in midsummer heat over many days causing much suffering to man and beast and demanding tenacity and endurance on the part of all who took part
the battle of romani marked the end of the german and ottoman campaign against the suez canal the offensive had passed decisively into the hands of the british empire force led by the anzac mounted division
after the battle von kressenstein 's force was pushed back across the sinai peninsula to be beaten at the battle of magdhaba in december <year> and back to the border of ottoman empire @-@ controlled palestine to be defeated at the battle of rafa in january <year> which effectively secured the egyptian sinai peninsula
this successful seven @-@ month @-@ long british empire campaign begun at romani in august ended at the first battle of gaza in march <year>
it has been suggested that like the attack on the suez canal in <year> it was merely a raid to disrupt maritime traffic rather than a determined attempt to gain control of the canal
that the ottoman empire 's intention was to strongly occupy romani and kantara is supported by preparations in the southern territory of palestine adjacent to and extending into the sinai
these included extending the palestine railway system to wadi el arish with a good motor road beside the railway
cisterns and other works were constructed along this route to store water and at wadi el arish enormous rock cut reservoirs were under construction in december <year> when the anzac mounted division reached that place just before the battle of magdhaba
murray lawrence and chauvel have all been criticised for letting von kressenstein 's force escape
further it has been asserted that the tactics of the mounted troops actually helped the enemy withdrawal by concentrating on direct assaults rather than flank attacks
the official british historian acknowledges the disappointment caused by the successful retirement of the german austrian and ottoman force but he also notes the quality of the successive rearguard positions constructed during the advance and the strength determination and endurance of the enemy
the strength of the rearguards was clearly demonstrated at bir el abd on <num> august when the mounted force attempted to outflank the large entrenched force
they failed because they were greatly outnumbered
indeed if the anzac mounted division had succeeded in getting round the flank without infantry support they would have been faced with vastly superior forces and could have been annihilated
it has been suggested that an opportunity was lost on <num> august to encircle and capture the invading austrian german and ottoman force when it was allowed to withdraw to katia
the infantry 's difficulties regarding the supply of water and camel transport combined with their lack of desert training together with lawrence 's confusing orders for infantry in the <num> lowland division to move south and east stopped them from promptly advancing to cut off the retreating force in the early hours of the second day 's battle
general lawrence was criticised for taking a grave and unnecessary risk by relying on just one entrenched infantry division and two light horse brigades to defend romani
that the strong enemy attack on the 1st and <num> light horse brigades during the first night 's battle pushed them so far back that the planned flanking attack by the new zealand mounted rifles brigade became almost a frontal attack
lawrence was also faulted for remaining at his headquarters at kantara which was considered to be too far from the battlefield and that this contributed to his loss of control of the battle during the first day when the telephone line was cut and he was out of contact with romani
lawrence was also criticised for not going forward to supervise the execution of his orders on <num> august when there was a failure to coordinate the movements of the <num> light horse brigade and the mobile column
chauvel responded by pointing out that the criticisms of the battle were in danger of obscuring the significance of the victory
i cannot speak too highly of the gallantry steadfastness and untiring energy shown by this fine division throughout the operations
these anzac troops are the keystone of the defence of egypt
but he failed to ensure the fighting qualities of these soldiers earned them a proportionate share of recognition and honours
further despite claims that chauvel alone had a clear view of the battle that his coolness and skill were crucial in gaining the victory his name was omitted from the long list of honours published on new year 's day <year>
murray did offer chauvel a lesser award a distinguished service order for romani which he declined
on reading murray 's description in his official despatch covering the battle and reprinted in a paris edition of the daily mail chauvel wrote to his wife on <num> december <year> @,@ i am afraid my men will be very angry when they see it
i cannot understand why the old man cannot do justice to those to whom he owed so much and the whole thing is so absolutely inconsistent with what he had already cabled
it was not until after the victory at the battle of rafa that chauvel was made a knight commander of the order of st michael and st george but this particular order is awarded for important non @-@ military service in a foreign country
it was not just his military service at romani which had not been recognised but also the service of all those who fought in the anzac mounted division at romani at el arish at magdhaba and at rafa
in september <year> not long after general edmund allenby became commander in chief of the egyptian expeditionary force chauvel wrote to ghq to point out the injustice done to his front @-@ line troops acknowledging that it was difficult to do anything now to right this but consider the commander @-@ in @-@ chief should know that there is a great deal of bitterness over it
the litigators is about a two @-@ partner chicago law firm attempting to strike it rich in a class action lawsuit over a cholesterol reduction drug by a major pharmaceutical drug company
the protagonist is a harvard law school grad big law firm burnout who stumbles upon the boutique and joins it only to find himself litigating against his old law firm in this case
the book is regarded as more humorous than most of grisham 's prior novels
the theme of a young lawyer being fed up with a giant law firm and bolting away to less lucrative but more satisfying career is shared with the associate
the theme of a lawsuit against a giant corporation appeared in the runaway jury but in the present book the corporation is vindicated and proven to have been unjustly maligned at least on the specific drug which is the subject of the lawsuit and the mass tort lawyers are seen as greedy and unscrupulous ultimately bolting and leaving the protagonist 's tiny chicago firm in the lurch
critical reviews were mixed for the book with several opinions noting a lack of suspense
nonetheless the book has achieved both hardcover and ebook <num> best seller status on various lists including both the new york times and the wall street journal
however since some services do not separate fiction and non @-@ fiction books it did not debut as a <num> bestseller on certain lists such as the usa today
some reviewers noted that this story would lend itself to an adapted screenplay
including the release of the litigators grisham has produced <num> adult fiction novels and <num> children 's fiction novels as well as a short story collection
in addition he has produced one non @-@ fiction book
thus various sources claim this to be his <num> <num> or <num> book
in the first of a two @-@ part interview with the wall street journal grisham claimed that although he usually attempts to include humor in his submitted drafts it is usually removed during the editorial process
however in this case much of the humor survived editing
in the second part of the interview the following week grisham noted that his inspirations for the book included television advertisements and the deepwater horizon oil spill

while wally goes to a funeral home to attend the wake of a former estate client the client 's son claims that his father was killed by krayoxx a cholesterol @-@ lowering drug developed by the fictional pharmaceutical company varrick labs
ecstatic at the possible monetary returns on the case the firm finds several former clients who appear to have valid claims about krayoxx
oscar and wally generate publicity in the chicago tribune with a picture of their filing this induces an avalanche of communications and leads them to several additional claimants
wally notices a blossoming class action lawsuit against varrick labs in florida and realizes that if he can find some patients to sign as clients he can earn a big payday on another firm 's coattails
however some complications make the story interesting
although none of the three finley figg lawyers had previously argued in united states federal court that is where they find themselves pitted against zinc 's old firm with this case
in fact david 's expertise was in long @-@ term bonds
once the firm 's claims become prominent mass tort operators approach them about being part of a mass settlement
wally flies to las vegas to meet the other mass tort interests most notably jerry alisandros
varrick 's ceo flies to chicago to meet nadine karros a leading defense attorney who works for rogan rothberg
believing that they can get federal judge harry seawright to claim jurisdiction karros is chosen for her firms ties to him and her expertise

oscar shot him and added an unnecessary debilitating shot that shattered his leg
he was sued for using excessive force
with varrick having spent <num> million dollars defending itself and the mass tort bar having vociferously discredited krayoxx in the mass media karros motioned for frivolous lawsuit sanctions pending a withdrawn motion
additionally actions were initiated for legal malpractice regarding wally 's letters that promised <num> million dollar settlement followed by motions to dismiss without notifying his clients
after realizing that they could be sued for defense costs and malpractice for withdrawing the case finley figg withdraw their motions and agree to a jury trial that they believe to be futile
the trial opens as originally scheduled
during opening statements oscar suffered a myocardial infarction
wally attempted to make light of the situation by proclaiming it an example of krayoxx effects
karros moved for mistrial and the motion was granted leading to the need to pick a new jury
wally stood in for oscar as lead attorney while a new jury was seated and for the first day of testimony
the next day the recovering alcoholic figg was nowhere to be found although an empty pint bottle of smirnoff vodka was

the wall street journal 's christopher john farley noted that the book is lighter than grisham 's other works
publishers weekly called it a bitingly farcical look at lawyers at the bottom of the food chain
cnn described the book as an original perspective of the best and worst the american system of justice has to offer
louis bayard of the washington post who described himself as someone who abandoned grisham after his first three novels noted that this book might be a good starting point for those who have tired of grisham
andrea simakis of the plain dealer describes the book as a heartier meal than grisham 's usual potato @-@ chip fiction
publishers weekly also notes that the fairy tale ending is not really in keeping with the introduction 's dark humor
rick arthur of the united arab emirates publication the national describes the book unfavorably as a cross between prior grisham works the street lawyer and the king of torts and similarly describes the protagonist unfavorably to those of the firm and the rainmaker
geoffrey wansell of the daily mail presented one of the more favorable reviews describing the book as a spectacular return to form displaying the clarity and passion that were there in his first thrillers but seemed to ebb away
wansell notes that grisham returned to one of his seminal themes of the idealistic young lawyer fighting with the realization that corporations only care about maximizing profits
the book has been derided for its lack of suspense
carol memmott of usa today says that grisham 's latest attempt to capture the spirit of the legal david and goliath story is missing the ratcheting @-@ up of suspense that he has employed successfully in recent adult and youth novels
harshaw claims that the book is lacking in the suspense that made the firm so successful
arthur finds elements of the plot implausible and the story unsuspenseful as well as unsatisfying
although the book is somewhat predictable bayard notes that grisham swerves clear of the usual melodramatic devices
corporations aren ’ t intrinsically venal plaintiffs aren ’ t lambent with goodness
and best of all no one is murdered for stumbling too close to the truth
some sources noted that the book has potential to become an adapted screenplay
irish independent describes grisham 's new book as following his usual route to the bestsellers list and projects it as a candidate to be his next hollywood film
although it is standard grisham fare independent noted that it provides the usual thrills in grisham 's comfortable legal world and should be a gripping read for his usual fans
the sunday express noted that the book could be readily converted to a screenplay but its critic robin callender smith viewed the ambulance chasing ethos as a foreign thing that brits might have to worry about in the near future
simakis praised the book for having more depth of character than grisham 's novels customarily do
she compares the protagonist to mitch mcdeere from the firm and rudy baylor from the rainmaker
memmott says that most of the claimants that they find are unsympathetic but a few are from somewhat sympathetic immigrant families
simakis notes that wally trades sex for legal services with one claimant
harshaw says that the book is a bit sentimental and comparatively lacking in terms of secondary character development for grisham
larry orenstein of canada 's globe and mail notes that on the dramatic scale this book has instances of laugh out loud humor that make it more like boston legal than the practice which boston legal was spun off from

circumscribed in <year> by mycologists manfred binder and andreas bresinsky it contains nine genera and about <num> species
the suborder contains a diverse assemblage fruit body morphologies including boletes gasteroid forms earthstars genus astraeus and puffballs
most species are ectomycorrhizal although the ecological role of some species is not known with certainty
the suborder is thought to have originated in the late cretaceous <num> – <num> ma in asia and north america and the major genera diversified around the mid cenozoic <num> – <num> ma
this research was an extension of binder 's <year> graduate work in which he argued for the need to recognize the molecular differences of the sclerodermatoid fungi
sclerodermatineae is one of six lineages of the boletales recognized as a suborder the others are the boletineae paxillineae suillineae tapinellineae and coniophorineae
of the nine genera assigned to the sclerodermatineae three are hymenomycetes boletinellus gyroporus and phlebopus and six are gasteroid astraeus calostoma diplocystis pisolithus and scleroderma
since the suborder 's original description there have been several phylogenetic studies investigating the sclerodermatineae
some studies have revealed the existence of numerous cryptic species and have contributed to taxonomic expansion of the group
the core sclerodermatineae include the genera astraeus calostoma scleroderma pisolithus diplocystis tremellogaster all gasteroid and the boletoid genus gyroporus phlebopus and boletinellus resolved as sister to this core group
as of <year> there are an estimated <num> species in the sclerodermatineae
the type of the suborder is the family sclerodermataceae other families in the suborder are the boletinellaceae diplocystaceae and the gyroporaceae
boletinellaceae boletinellus <num> species phlebopus <num> species diplocystaceae astraeus <num> species diplocystis <num> species endogonopsis <num> species tremellogaster <num> species gyroporaceae gyroporus <num> species sclerodermataceae calostoma <num> species chlorogaster <num> species favillea <num> species horakiella <num> species pisolithus <num> species scleroderma about <num> species based on ancestral reconstruction studies the earliest basal members of the sclerodermatineae originated in the late cretaceous <num> – <num> ma
the major genera diversified near the mid cenozoic <num> – <num> ma
asia and north america are the most probable ancestral areas for all sclerodermatineae and pinaceae and angiosperms primarily rosids are the most probable ancestral hosts
boletoid fruit bodies sometimes have hollow stipes with a surface that is smooth to somewhat furfuraceous covered with flaky particles and lack the reticulation a net @-@ like pattern of interlacing lines characteristic of some members of the boletaceae
the pores are merulioid wrinkled with low uneven ridges boletinoid and either fine or coarse
the flesh is usually whitish to yellowish and some species exhibit a blue staining reaction upon injury
in mass spores are yellow microscopically the spores are ellipsoid in shape and have a smooth surface
gasteroid fruit body types are either roughly spherical or tuberous occasionally with stipes and usually have a peridium that is either simple or multi @-@ layered
mature gasteroid fruit bodies generally open irregularly at maturity to expose a powdery gleba with a color ranging from white to yellow or black @-@ brown to black
capillitia are generally absent from the gleba
spores are spherical or nearly so and have a surface texture that ranges from smooth to wart @-@ like and spiny or sometimes with reticulations
hyphae have clamp connections
the hymenomycete genera boletinellus gyroporus and phlebopus are typical boletes with a cap and stipe
however each of the gasteroid sclerodermatineae has a distinct morphology
species of astraeus have an earthstar morphology where the outer peridium peels back in sections
the gleba of pisolithus is partitioned into hundreds of membranous chambers
scleroderma is a simple puffball with a thin outer skin and a powdery gleba at maturity
diplocystis and tremellogaster are each distinct in their morphologies the former comprises compound fruit bodies each with <num> – <num> spore sacs crowded together while the latter forms a roughly spherical sporocarp with a thick multi @-@ layered peridium
calostoma greek for pretty mouth is morphologically distinct from other gasteroid members having a fruit body that forms a globed spore @-@ bearing head composed of a three @-@ layered peridium
about two @-@ thirds of sclerodermatineae species have a gasteroid morphology although this may be an underestimate due to the existence of cryptic species that have yet to be formally described
for example studies of the gasteroid genera astraeus and pisolithus indicate the existence of numerous cryptic taxa
studies have demonstrated that astraeus pisolithus and scleroderma form ectomycorrhizal associations with both angiosperms and gymnosperms
previously thought to be saprophytic the calostomataceae were determined to be ectomycorrhizal with fagaceae and myrtaceae using isotopic and molecular analyses
species from the genera pisolithus and scleroderma have been used in forestry as mycorrhizal inocula to help promote the growth and vigor of young seedlings
as a group the sclerodermatineae have a broad distribution and some genera pisolithus and scleroderma have been found on all continents except antarctica

the episode guest starred actors suzie plakson kevin michael richardson fred tatasciore and wally wingert
recurring guest voice actors included writer and animator butch hartman and actor patrick bristow
much of the episode 's humor is structured around cutaway sequences that parody popular culture including references to speed racer happy days nova one day at a time and the more you know
critical reception for the episode was mixed certain critics believed the episode was not an instant classic in contrast to the other episodes of the season but called it memorable and brilliant nevertheless while others regarded it as the black sheep of the season

peter shin and roy allen smith who have since supervised other episodes of family guy both acted as supervising directors on this episode
alex borstein the voice of lois helped write this episode making her the first female member in the family guy writing staff show creator seth macfarlane mentioned that her input on the character of lois was particularly helpful
andrew gormley and voice actor mike henry acted as staff writers for this episode while ricky blitt neil goldman and chris sheridan worked as the story editors
the subplot of the son also draws that involved lois losing the car was based on the <year> comedy film lost in america
the part where peter pretends to be an indian to get the family car back was inspired by real @-@ life instances of people who were <num> <num> native american receiving money from wealthy casino tribes

at present it contains the single species protomycena electra known from a single specimen collected in an amber mine in the cordillera septentrional area of the dominican republic
the fruit body of the fungus has a convex cap that is <num> mm <num>
<num> in in diameter with distantly spaced gills on the underside
the curved stipe is smooth and cylindrical measuring <num>
<num> mm <num>
<num> in thick by <num> mm <num>
<num> in long and lacks a ring
it resembles extant currently living species of the genus mycena
protomycena is one of only five known agaric fungus species known in the fossil record and the second to be described from dominican amber
the specimen was collected in one of the amber mines in the cordillera septentrional area of the island of hispaniola in the dominican republic
the amber is believed to date from the miocene burdigalian stage about <num> to <num> million years before the present
it was first studied by a group of researchers consisting of david hibbett and michael donoghue from harvard university with david grimaldi of the american museum of natural history
hibbett and colleagues published their <year> type description in the american journal of botany
the generic name protomycena is derived from a combination of the latin proto meaning first and mycena a modern genus that it resembles
the specific epithet electra was coined by the authors from the latin for amber in reference to the mode of preservation
when it was reported protomycena electra was the third species of fossil agaric fungus to be described
the two species coprinites dominicana and aureofungus yaniguaensis are also known from the amber mines of the dominican republic while the fourth species archaeomarasmius leggeti is from the older cretaceous age new jersey amber
with the <year> publication of a fifth extinct agaric species palaeoagaracites antiquus the minimum age for the agaricales order was pushed back to the albian approximately <num> ma
<num> – <num>
<num> cm <num>
<num> – <num>
<num> in wide
the pileus is <num> mm <num>
<num> in in diameter and has a convex shape sporting a raised central region an umbo
the pale flesh appears yellowish in the amber and is smooth and glossy changing to striate and slightly translucent towards the margin
the pileus margin is striated and slightly flared
the gills on the underside of the pileus are broadly attached adnate to the top of the stipe and distantly spaced — between six and eight gills extend completely from the pileus margin to the stipe
these full @-@ length gills are anastomosed with lamellulae short gills which do not reach the edge of the stipe from the pileus margin of varying lengths
the pileus is centered on the curved stipe which is smooth and cylindrical measuring <num>
<num> mm <num>
<num> in thick by <num> mm <num>
<num> in long
the stipe lacks a ring and rhizoids
the mushroom is preserved with a small liquid and gas @-@ filled bubble possibly originating from the mushroom itself which indicates the amber to be very solid and well @-@ sealed
in hibbett and colleagues <year> publication protomycena was placed in the subfamily myceneae which at the time was considered part of the tricholomataceae family mycena is currently classified in the mycenaceae family
the placement was based solely on the visible structures or macromorphology of the fruit body
many of the features which are typically used to classify species into fungal families and subfamilies are based on microscopic features not visible or preserved in the amber specimen
consequently the assignment to mycena is provisional the authors also note certain similarities with extant members of marasmius and the describing authors leave open the option of treating the genus placement as incertae sedis uncertain placement within the agaricales
protomycena is distinct from other amber @-@ preserved mushroom taxa such as coprinites in the grooved surface of its pileus and its anastomosing gills
in the early middle ages there were distinct material cultures evident in the different federations and kingdoms within what is now scotland
pictish art was the only uniquely scottish medieval style it can be seen in the extensive survival of carved stones particularly in the north and east of the country which hold a variety of recurring images and patterns
it can also be seen in elaborate metal work that largely survives in buried hoards
irish @-@ scots art from the kingdom of dál riata suggests that it was one of the places as a crossroads between cultures where the insular style developed
insular art is the name given to the common style that developed in britain and ireland from the eighth century and which became highly influential in continental europe and contributed to the development of romanesque and gothic styles
it can be seen in elaborate jewellery often making extensive use of semi @-@ precious stones in the heavily carved high crosses found particularly in the highlands and islands but distributed across the country and particularly in the highly decorated illustrated manuscripts such as the book of kells which may have been begun or wholly created at the monastic centre of iona
scotland adopted the romanesque style relatively late and retained and revived elements of its style after the gothic style had become dominant from the thirteenth century
much of the best scottish artwork of the high and late middle ages was either religious in nature or realised in metal and woodwork and has not survived the impact of time and the reformation
however examples of sculpture are extant as part of church architecture including evidence of elaborate church interiors
from the thirteenth century there are relatively large numbers of monumental effigies
native craftsmanship can be seen in a variety of items
visual illustration can be seen in the illumination of charters and occasional survivals of church paintings
surviving copies of individual portraits are relatively crude but more impressive are the works or artists commissioned from the continent particularly the netherlands
class i stones are those thought to date to the period up to the seventh century and are the most numerous group
the stones are largely unshaped and include incised symbols of animals such as fish and the pictish beast everyday objects such as mirrors combs and tuning forks and abstract symbols defined by names including v @-@ rod double disc and z @-@ rod
they are found between from the firth of forth to shetland
the greatest concentrations are in sutherland around modern inverness and aberdeen
good examples include the dunrobin sutherland and aberlemno stones angus
class ii stones are carefully shaped slabs dating after the arrival of christianity in the eighth and ninth centuries with a cross on one face and a wide range of symbols on the reverse
in smaller numbers than class i stones they predominate in southern pictland in perth angus and fife
good examples include glamis <num> which contains a finely executed celtic cross on the main face with two opposing male figures a centaur cauldron deer head and a triple disc symbol and cossans angus which shows a high @-@ prowed pictish boat with oarsmen and a figure facing forward in the prow
class iii stones are thought to overlap chronologically with class ii stones
most are elaborately shaped and incised cross @-@ slabs some with figurative scenes but lacking idiomatic pictish symbols
they are widely distributed but predominate in the southern pictish areas
the earlier picts appear to have had a considerable amount of silver available probably from raiding further south or the payment of subsidies to keep them from doing so
the very large hoard of late roman hacksilver found at traprain law may have originated in either way
the largest hoard of early pictish metalwork was found in <year> at norrie 's law in fife but unfortunately much was dispersed and melted down
over ten heavy silver chains some over <num>
<num> metres <num>
<num> ft long have been found from this period the double @-@ linked whitecleuch chain is one of only two that have a penannular ring with symbol decoration including enamel which shows how these were probably used as choker necklaces
the st ninian 's isle treasure of <num> silver and silver @-@ gilt objects contains perhaps the best collection of late pictish forms from the christian period when pictish metalwork style as with stone @-@ carving gradually merged with insular anglo @-@ saxon and viking styles
this can be seen in representations found in excavations of the fortress of dunadd which combine pictish and irish elements
this included extensive evidence for the production of high status jewellery and moulds from the seventh century that indicate the production of pieces similar to the hunterston brooch found in ayrshire which may have been made in dál riata but with elements that suggest irish origins
these and other finds including a trumpet spiral decorated hanging bowl disc and a stamped animal decoration or pressblech perhaps from a bucket or drinking horn indicate the ways in which dál riata was one of the locations where the insular style was developed
in the eighth and ninth centuries the pictish elite adopted true penannular brooches with lobed terminals from ireland
some older irish pseudo @-@ penannular brooches were adapted to the pictish style for example the breadalbane brooch british museum
the eighth century monymusk reliquary has elements of pictish and irish style
there is only one known pagan burial in scotland at dalmeny midlothian which contains a necklace of beads similar to those found in mid @-@ seventh @-@ century southern england
other isolated finds include a gold object from dalmeny shaped like a truncated pyramid with filigree and garnet similar to sword harness mounts found at sutton hoo
there is also a bun @-@ shaped loom from yetholm roxburghshire and a ring with an anglian runic inscription
from eastern scotland there is a seventh @-@ century sword pommel from culbin sands moray and the burghead drinking horn mount
after christianisation in the seventh century artistic styles in northumbria which then reached to the firth of forth interacted with those in ireland and what is now scotland to become part of the common style historians have identified as insular or hiberno @-@ saxon
surviving examples of insular art are found in metalwork carving but mainly in illuminated manuscripts
in manuscripts surfaces are highly decorated with intricate patterning with no attempt to give an impression of depth volume or recession
the best examples include the book of kells which may have been wholly or partly created in iona and the book of durrow which may be from ireland or northumbria
carpet pages are a characteristic feature of insular manuscripts although historiated initials an insular invention canon tables and figurative miniatures especially evangelist portraits are also common
the finest era of the style was brought to an end by the disruption to monastic centres and aristocratic life of the viking raids in the late eighth century
christianity discouraged the burial of grave goods so the majority of examples of insular metalwork that survive from the christian period have been found in archaeological contexts that suggest they were rapidly hidden lost or abandoned
there are a few exceptions notably portable shrines cumdachs for books or relics several of which have been continuously owned mostly by churches on the continent — though the monymusk reliquary has always been in scotland
the highest quality survivals are either secular jewellery the largest and most elaborate pieces probably for male wearers tableware or altarware
the finest church pieces were probably made by secular workshops often attached to a royal household though other pieces were made by monastic workshops
there are a number of large brooches each of their designs is wholly individual in detail and the workmanship is varied
many elements of the designs can be directly related to elements used in manuscripts
surviving stones used in decoration are semi @-@ precious ones with amber and rock crystal among the commonest and some garnets
coloured glass enamel and millefiori glass probably imported are also used
none of the major insular manuscripts like the book of kells have preserved their elaborate jewelled metal covers but documentary evidence indicates that these were as spectacular as the few remaining continental examples
the most significant survivals in sculpture are in high crosses large free @-@ standing stone crosses usually carved in relief with patterns biblical iconography and occasionally inscriptions
the tradition may have begun in ireland or anglo @-@ saxon england and then spread to scotland
they are found throughout the british isles and often feature a stone ring around the intersection forming a celtic cross apparently an innovation of celtic christianity that may have begun at iona
distribution in scotland is heaviest in the highlands and islands and they can be dated to the period c
<num> to <num>
all the surviving crosses are of stone but there are indications that large numbers of wooden crosses may also have existed
in scotland biblical iconography is less common than in ireland but the subject of king david is relatively frequently depicted
in the east the influence of pictish sculpture can be seen in areas of viking occupation and settlement crosses for the tenth to the twelfth centuries have distinctive scandinavian patterns often mixed with native styles
important examples dated to the eighth century include st martin 's cross on iona the kildalton cross from the hebrides and the anglo @-@ saxon ruthwell cross
through the hiberno @-@ scottish mission to the continent insular art was highly influential on subsequent european medieval art especially the decorative elements of romanesque and gothic styles
ribbon @-@ interlace was important and plant motifs became fashionable in the tenth and eleventh centuries
most scottish artefacts come from <num> pagan burials in the north and west from the mid @-@ ninth to the mid @-@ tenth centuries
these include jewellery weapons and occasional elaborate high status items
amongst the most impressive of these is the scar boat burial on orkney which contained an elaborate sword quiver with arrows a brooch bone comb gaming pieces and the scar dragon plaque made from whalebone most of which were probably made in scandinavia
from the west another boat burial at kiloron bay in colonsay revealed a sword shield iron cauldron and enamelled scales which may be celtic in origin
a combination of viking and celtic styles can be see in a penannular brooch from pierowall in orkney which has a pictish @-@ style looped pin
it is about two inches in diameter with traces of gilding and probably housed a piece of amber surrounded by interweaving ribbons
after the conversion to christianity from the tenth to the twelfth centuries stone crosses and cross @-@ slabs in viking occupied areas of the highlands and islands were carved with successive styles of viking ornament
they were frequently mixed with native interlace and animal patterns
examples include the eleventh @-@ century cross @-@ slab from dóid mhàiri on the island of islay where the plant motifs on either side of the cross @-@ shaft are based upon the ringerike style of viking art
the most famous artistic find from modern scotland the lewis chessmen from uig were probably made in trondheim in norway but contain some decoration that may have been influenced by celtic patterns
much of the best scottish artwork of the high and late middle ages was either religious in nature or realised in metal and woodwork and has not survived the impact of time and the reformation
however examples of sculpture are extant as part of church architecture a small number of significant crafted items have also survived and for the end of the period there is evidence of painting particularly the extensive commissioning of works in the low countries and france
the interiors of churches were often more elaborate before the reformation with highly decorated sacrament houses like the ones surviving at deskford and kinkell
the carvings at rosslyn chapel created in the mid @-@ fifteenth century elaborately depicting the progression of the seven deadly sins are considered some of the finest in the gothic style
monumental effigies began to appear in churches from the thirteenth century and they were usually fully coloured and gilded
many were founders and patrons of churches and chapels including members of the clergy knights and often their wives
in contrast to england where the fashion for stone @-@ carved monuments gave way to brass etchings they continued to be produced until the end of the medieval period with the largest group dating from the fifteenth century including the very elaborate douglas tombs in the town of douglas
sometimes the best continental artists were employed as for robert i 's elaborate tomb in dunfermline abbey which was made in his lifetime by the parisian sculptor thomas of chartres but of which only fragments now survive
the greatest group of surviving sculpture from this period are from the west highlands beginning in the fourteenth century on iona under the patronage of the lordship of the isles and continuing until the reformation
common motifs were ships swords harps and romanesque vine leaf tracery with celtic elements
the scottish elite and church now participated in a culture stretching across europe and many objects that do survive are imported such as limoges enamels
it is often difficult to decide the country of creation of others as work in international styles was produced in scotland along with pieces retaining more distinctive local styles
two secular small chests with carved whalebone panels and metal fittings illustrate some aspects of the scottish arts
the eglington and fife caskets are very similar and were probably made by the same workshop around <year> as boxes for valuables such as jewellery or documents
the overall form of the caskets follows french examples and the locks and metal bands are decorated in gothic style with simple decorations of fleurons and debased egg and dart while the whalebone panels are carved in relief with a late form of insular interwoven strapwork characteristic of late medieval west scotland
key examples of native craftsmanship on items include the bute mazer the earliest surviving drinking cup of its type made of maple @-@ wood and with elaborate silver @-@ gilt ornamentation dated to around <num>
the savernake horn was probably made for the earl of moray in the fourteenth century and looted by the english in the mid @-@ sixteenth century
a few significant reliquaries survive from west scotland examples of the habit of the celtic church of treating the possessions rather than the bones of saints as relics
as in irish examples these were partly reworked and elaborated at intervals over a long period
these are st fillan 's crozier and its coigreach or reliquary between them with elements from each century from the eleventh to the fifteenth the guthrie bell shrine iona twelfth to fifteenth century and the kilmichael glassary bell shrine argyll mid @-@ twelfth century
the skye chess piece is a single elaborate piece in carved walrus ivory with two warriors carrying heraldic shields in a framework of openwork vegetation
it is thought to be scottish of the mid @-@ thirteenth century with aspects similar to both english and norwegian pieces
one of the largest groups of surviving works of art are the seal matrices that appear to have entered scottish usage with feudalism in the reign of david i beginning at the royal court and among his anglo @-@ norman vassals and then by about <num> they began to spread to the gaelicised areas of the country
they would be made compulsory for barons of the king in a statute of <year> and seal matrices show very high standards of skill and artistry
examples of items that were probably the work of continental artists include the delicate hanging lamp in st
john 's kirk in perth the vestments and hangings in holyrood and the medieval maces of the universities of st andrews and glasgow
very little painting from scottish churches survives
there is only one surviving doom painting in scotland at guthrie near arbroath which may have been painted by the same artist as the elaborate crucifixion and other paintings at foulis easter eighteen miles away
as in england the monarchy may have had model portraits of royalty used for copies and reproductions but the versions of native royal portraits that survive are generally crude by continental standards
much more impressive are the works or artists imported from the continent particularly the netherlands generally considered the centre of painting in the northern renaissance
the products of these connections included a fine portrait of william elphinstone bishop of aberdeen <year> – <year> the images of st catherine and st john brought to dunkeld hugo van der goes 's altarpiece for the trinity college church in edinburgh commissioned by james iii and the work after which the flemish master of james iv of scotland is named
there are also a relatively large number of elaborate devotional books from the late fifteenth and early sixteenth centuries usually produced in the low countries and france for scottish patrons including the prayer book commissioned by robert blackadder bishop of glasgow between <year> and <year> and the flemish illustrated book of hours known as the hours of james iv of scotland given by james iv to margaret tudor and described as perhaps the finest medieval manuscript to have been commissioned for scottish use
he is typically portrayed as an anthropomorphic egg though he is not explicitly described so
the first recorded versions of the rhyme date from late eighteenth @-@ century england and the tune from <year> in james william elliott 's national nursery rhymes and nursery songs
its origins are obscure and several theories have been advanced to suggest original meanings
the character of humpty dumpty was popularised in the united states by actor george l
fox <year> – <num>
as a character and literary allusion he has appeared or been referred to in a large number of works of literature and popular culture particularly lewis carroll 's through the looking @-@ glass <year>
the rhyme is listed in the roud folk song index as no
<num>
the most common modern text is it is a single quatrain with external rhymes that follow the pattern of aabb and with a trochaic metre which is common in nursery rhymes
the melody commonly associated with the rhyme was first recorded by composer and nursery rhyme collector james william elliott in his national nursery rhymes and nursery songs london <year>
the roud folk song index catalogues folk songs and their variations by number and classifies this song as <num>
it was published in <year> in a version of gammer gurton 's garland as in <year> james orchard halliwell published a collected version as according to the oxford english dictionary the term humpty dumpty referred to a drink of brandy boiled with ale in the seventeenth century
the riddle probably exploited for misdirection the fact that humpty dumpty was also eighteenth @-@ century reduplicative slang for a short and clumsy person
the riddle may depend upon the assumption that a clumsy person falling off a wall might not be irreparably damaged whereas an egg would be
the rhyme is no longer posed as a riddle since the answer is now so well known
similar riddles have been recorded by folklorists in other languages such as boule boule in french lille trille in swedish and norwegian and runtzelken @-@ puntzelken or humpelken @-@ pumpelken in different parts of germany — although none is as widely known as humpty dumpty is in english
there are also various theories of an original humpty dumpty
one advanced by katherine elwes thomas in <year> and adopted by robert ripley posits that humpty dumpty is king richard iii of england depicted as humpbacked in tudor histories and particularly in shakespeare 's play and who was defeated despite his armies at bosworth field in <year>
professor david daube suggested in the oxford magazine of <num> february <year> that humpty dumpty was a tortoise siege engine an armoured frame used unsuccessfully to approach the walls of the parliamentary held city of gloucester in <year> during the siege of gloucester in the english civil war
this was on the basis of a contemporary account of the attack but without evidence that the rhyme was connected
the theory was part of an anonymous series of articles on the origin of nursery rhymes and was widely acclaimed in academia but it was derided by others as ingenuity for ingenuity 's sake and declared to be a spoof
the link was nevertheless popularised by a children 's opera all the king 's men by richard rodney bennett first performed in <year>
from <year> the website of the colchester tourist board attributed the origin of the rhyme to a cannon recorded as used from the church of st mary @-@ at @-@ the @-@ wall by the royalist defenders in the siege of <year>
in <year> colchester was a walled town with a castle and several churches and was protected by the city wall
the story given was that a large cannon which the website claimed was colloquially called humpty dumpty was strategically placed on the wall
a shot from a parliamentary cannon succeeded in damaging the wall beneath humpty dumpty which caused the cannon to tumble to the ground
the royalists or cavaliers all the king 's men attempted to raise humpty dumpty on to another part of the wall but the cannon was so heavy that all the king 's horses and all the king 's men couldn 't put humpty together again
author albert jack claimed in his <year> book pop goes the weasel the secret meanings of nursery rhymes that there were two other verses supporting this claim
elsewhere he claimed to have found them in an old dusty library in an even older book but did not state what the book was or where it was found
it has been pointed out that the two additional verses are not in the style of the seventeenth century or of the existing rhyme and that they do not fit with the earliest printed versions of the rhyme which do not mention horses and men
i don 't know what you mean by glory alice said
humpty dumpty smiled contemptuously
of course you don 't — till i tell you
i meant there 's a nice knock @-@ down argument for you but glory doesn 't mean a nice knock @-@ down argument alice objected
when i use a word humpty dumpty said in rather a scornful tone it means just what i choose it to mean — neither more nor less
the question is said alice whether you can make words mean so many different things
the question is said humpty dumpty which is to be master — that 's all
alice was too much puzzled to say anything so after a minute humpty dumpty began again
they 've a temper some of them — particularly verbs they 're the proudest — adjectives you can do anything with but not verbs — however i can manage the whole lot impenetrability that 's what i say this passage was used in britain by lord atkin in his dissenting judgement in the seminal case liversidge v
anderson <year> where he protested about the distortion of a statute by the majority of the house of lords
it also became a popular citation in united states legal opinions appearing in <num> judicial decisions in the westlaw database as of <num> april <year> including two supreme court cases tva v
hill and zschernig v
miller
it has been suggested by a
j
larner that carroll 's humpty dumpty had prosopagnosia on the basis of his description of his finding faces hard to recognise
the face is what one goes by generally alice remarked in a thoughtful tone
that 's just what i complain of said humpty dumpty
your face is the same as everybody has — the two eyes — marking their places in the air with his thumb nose in the middle mouth under
it 's always the same
now if you had the two eyes on the same side of the nose for instance — or the mouth at the top — that would be some help
american actor george l
fox <year> – <num> helped to popularise the character in nineteenth @-@ century stage productions of pantomime versions music and rhyme
the character is also a common literary allusion particularly to refer to a person in an insecure position something that would be difficult to reconstruct once broken or a short and fat person
humpty dumpty has been used in a large range of literary works in addition to his appearance as a character in through the looking @-@ glass including l
frank baum 's mother goose in prose <year> where the rhyming riddle is devised by the daughter of the king having witnessed humpty 's death and her father 's soldiers efforts to save him
in neil gaiman 's early short story the case of the four and twenty blackbirds the humpty dumpty story is turned into a film noir @-@ style hardboiled crime story involving also cock robin the queen of hearts little bo peep old mother hubbard and other characters from popular nursery rhymes
robert rankin used humpty dumpty as one victim of a serial fairy @-@ tale character murderer in the hollow chocolate bunnies of the apocalypse <year>
jasper fforde included humpty dumpty in his novels the well of lost plots <year> and the big over easy <year> which use him respectively as a ringleader of dissatisfied nursery rhyme characters threatening to strike and as the victim of a murder
the rhyme has also been used as a reference in more serious literary works including as a recurring motif of the fall of man in james joyce 's <year> novel finnegans wake
robert penn warren 's <year> american novel all the king 's men is the story of populist politician willie stark 's rise to the position of governor and eventual fall based on the career of the corrupt louisiana senator huey long
it won the <year> pulitzer prize and was twice made into a film all the king 's men in <year> and <year> the former winning the academy award for best motion picture
this was echoed in carl bernstein and bob woodward 's book all the president 's men about the watergate scandal referring to the failure of the president 's staff to repair the damage once the scandal had leaked out
it was filmed as all the president 's men in <year> starring robert redford and dustin hoffman
similarly humpty dumpty is referred to in paul auster 's <year> novel city of glass when two characters discuss him as the purest embodiment of the human condition and quote extensively from through the looking glass
it has also been used as a common motif in popular music including hank thompson 's humpty dumpty heart <year> the monkees all the king 's horses <year> aretha franklin 's all the king 's horses <year> tori amos 's humpty dumpty <year> and travis 's the humpty dumpty love song <year>

in an extra verse in one version of abba 's on and on and on humpty dumpty is mentioned as being afraid of falling off the wall
the law describes a process known as entropy a measure of the number of specific ways in which a system may be arranged often taken to be a measure of disorder
the higher the entropy the higher the disorder
after his fall and subsequent shattering the inability to put him together again is representative of this principle as it would be highly unlikely though not impossible to return him to his earlier state of lower entropy as the entropy of an isolated system never decreases
a variation on the poem using near @-@ sounding french nonsense words is often used to illustrate the difficulty of speech recognition in different languages
a common version is as follows to a listener expecting a nursery rhyme it will generally be heard as the english version while someone expecting french will instead tend to hear nonsense words
it began as a mainly amateur body and transformed into an all @-@ professional ensemble by <year>
in its early days the company gave a single week 's annual season in cardiff gradually extending its schedule to become an all @-@ year @-@ round operation with its own salaried chorus and orchestra
it has been described by the new york times as one of the finest operatic ensembles in europe
for most of its existence the company lacked a permanent base in cardiff but in <year> it moved into the new wales millennium centre cardiff bay
the company tours nationally and internationally giving more than <num> performances annually with a repertoire of eight operas each year to a combined audience of more than <num> @,@ <num> people
its most frequent venues other than cardiff are llandudno in wales and bristol birmingham liverpool milton keynes oxford plymouth and southampton in england
singers who have been associated with the company include geraint evans thomas allen anne evans and bryn terfel
guest artists from other countries have included joan hammond tito gobbi and elisabeth söderström
among the conductors have been sir charles mackerras reginald goodall james levine and pierre boulez
the company has been led since <year> by david pountney as chief executive and artistic director
the first welsh national opera company was formed in <year>
a local newspaper commented that it was remarkable that a race of people to whom vocal music is a ruling passion should not generations ago have established a permanent national opera
the company gave performances of operas by the welsh composer joseph parry in cardiff and on tour in wales
the company predominantly amateur with some professional guest singers from the london stage gave numerous performances of parry 's blodwen and arienwen composed in <year> and <year> respectively
an american tour was planned but the company folded and parry 's final opera the maid of cefn ydfa was given at cardiff by the moody @-@ manners opera company in <year>
a cardiff grand opera society ran from <year> to <year>
it presented week @-@ long annual seasons of popular operas including faust carmen and il trovatore and like its predecessor was mainly an amateur body with professional guest principals
apart from the productions of these two enterprises opera in wales in the late <num> and early <num> centuries was generally presented by visiting companies from england
in the <num> idloes owen a singing teacher and conductor ran an amateur choir the lyrian singers based in cardiff
in november <year> together with john morgan – a former carl rosa baritone – and morgan 's fiancée helena hughes brown owen agreed to found the lyrian grand opera company with brown as secretary and owen as conductor and general manager
they publicised their plan and held a general meeting of potential supporters in december <year> at that meeting the name of the proposed organisation was changed to welsh national opera company
by january <year> plans were far enough advanced for the company 's first rehearsals to be held
owen recruited a local businessman w
h
bill smith <year> – <year> who agreed to serve as business manager
at first doubtful of the company 's prospects smith became its dominant influence leading fund @-@ raiser and chairman for twenty years from <year>
the orchestra was professional mostly drawn from members of the bbc welsh orchestra all the singers were amateurs except for tudor davies a tenor well known at covent garden and sadler 's wells who sang canio in pagliacci
during the week @-@ long season the new company also staged faust with davies in the title role
although nearing the end of his career he was a considerable box @-@ office draw and the company played to full houses
nevertheless the expense of a professional orchestra and the hire of costumes and scenery outweighed the box @-@ office receipts and the season made a small loss
finance remained a recurring problem over the succeeding decades
although owen was the conductor for the performances of cavalliera rusticana and remained as musical director of the company until <year> his health was fragile and he conducted none of the company 's other productions
his colleague the chorus master ivor john was in charge of the first season 's pagliacci and faust
in <year> the organisation was registered as a limited company and the cardiff season was extended from one week to two
the following year the company gave its first performances in swansea
the chorus featured <num> performers by this time
the company 's first few seasons attracted little attention from the british musical establishment but by the early <num> london papers began to take notice
picture post hailed the wno 's chorus as the finest in britain
the times also praised the chorus it has body lightness rhythmic precision and most welcome of all unflagging and spontaneous freshness
by this time the company had expanded its repertoire to take in carmen la traviata madame butterfly the tales of hoffmann the bartered bride and die fledermaus
the times commented that smith owen and their colleagues were making history for wales
the shackles of puritanism which had kept this country from an art @-@ form perfectly suited to its national talents and predilections for histrionics and dressing @-@ up are as natural to the welsh as singing had been broken for ever
the pavilion was acoustically mediocre and lacked an orchestra pit two years later the company moved again to the new theatre where it played cardiff seasons across the next fifty years
the <year> season attracted particular interest because it included what was then a rarity verdi 's nabucco
the company built a reputation for staging seldom @-@ seen verdi works including the sicilian vespers staged in the same year i lombardi in <year> and the battle of legnano under the shortened title the battle in <year>
the <year> nabucco was the wno 's first production for which costumes and scenery were specially designed by patrick robertson rather than hired
in <year> the company staged its first work by a welsh composer menna by arwel hughes
the composer conducted and the leads were sung by two professional guest stars richard lewis and elsie morison
the same year marked wno 's first appearances outside wales playing a week at bournemouth in april and a week at manchester in october when the manchester guardian found the soloists first @-@ rate but the chorus disappointing in both nabucco and il trovatore
a reviewer in the musical times commented on potential difficulties in assembling the wholly amateur chorus for performances beyond daily travelling range of their day jobs
by the time of the company 's first london season – a week at sadler 's wells in <year> – the chorus was judged to be lively and exciting the musical times vibrant and moving the times and joyous the manchester guardian
by the mid @-@ <num> professional singers were cast in leading roles in most productions they included walter midgley in tosca and la bohème <year> raimund herincx in mefistofele <year> heather harper in la traviata <year> and joan hammond in madame butterfly <year>
a possibility of strengthening the professional element of the company was mooted in <year> when a merger was proposed with the carl rosa company which was in financial difficulties
the proposal was not followed through and wno continued independently while the carl rosa folded
during the <num> the company continued to widen its range
its first wagner production lohengrin and its first mozart the marriage of figaro were both performed in <year> conducted by charles groves
another welsh opera hughes 's serch yw 'r doctor love the doctor was staged in <year>
the popular italian repertoire remained the core of the annual seasons mostly directed by the head of production john moody
leading roles were taken by rising stars such as john shirley @-@ quirk gwyneth jones thomas allen josephine barstow and margaret price the last of whom made her operatic debut with the company in <year>
established singers guesting with the company included geraint evans who played the title role in don pasquale in <year> and ian wallace in the same part the following year
evans was also seen as leporello in don giovanni in <year> and as falstaff in <year>
the gradual switch from amateur to professional continued in <year> when for the first time the chorus was supplemented by a smaller professional group of singers the mix of amateur and professional choristers continued over the next five years
at the end of the <num> the main wno company now a year @-@ round operation consisted of <num> salaried principal singers <num> guest soloists and a chorus of <num> amateurs and <num> professionals
as well as the bournemouth players the company engaged the royal liverpool philharmonic city of birmingham symphony and ulster orchestras for different venues
in the last season of the decade <num> performances were given in cardiff and <num> elsewhere in the uk
in addition to the main company wno maintained two smaller groups one with orchestra toured welsh towns the other consisting of <num> singers with piano toured <num> mostly small towns in wales and england
wno instituted its own training scheme for young singers during the decade
three years later the last amateur element of the company was removed when the chorus became fully professional
a further broadening of the repertoire took place in the <num> in <year> wno staged the first performances in britain of berg 's lulu directed by michael geliot who had succeeded moody in <year>
in the view of malcolm boyd in the new grove dictionary of opera geliot unpredictable and often controversial largely shaped the company 's style in the <num>
in collaboration with the company 's musical director james lockhart geliot is credited by the times with introducing new young singers and directing a host of groundbreaking productions before leaving in <year>
the critic rodney milnes wrote in <year> about wno 's productions i have never seen well hardly ever a pretentious silly or seriously misguided production and neither have i seen a dull one
… the company 's greatest virtue is that its work is dedicated above all to the service of composers and audiences and not to some abstract notion of prestige nor to the vanity or ambition of individuals and in this it is almost unique
in <year> geliot 's wno staging of britten 's billy budd with allen in the title role was presented on a swiss tour and two years later it was given in barcelona
the company returned to london with its participation in the amoco festival of opera at the dominion theatre in <year> presenting the makropoulos case the magic flute ernani madame butterfly and tristan and isolde to capacity audiences
the company 's traditional preference for the italian repertoire was partly redressed during the decade productions include wno 's first staging of a richard strauss opera elektra in <year>
a new welsh work alun hoddinott 's the beach of falesá was presented in <year>
in <year> in co @-@ production with scottish opera wno began a cycle of janáček operas directed by david pountney
beginning with jenůfa the cycle continued with the makropoulos case <year> the cunning little vixen <year> kátya kabanová <year> and from the house of the dead <year>
among the guest artists who appeared with the company in the <num> were the baritone tito gobbi as falstaff <year> the sopranos elisabeth söderström as emilia in the makropoulos case <year> and anne evans as senta in the flying dutchman <year> and the conductors james levine aida <year> and reginald goodall tristan and isolde <year>
in the late <num> wno combined with the cardiff @-@ based welsh drama company becoming the welsh national opera and drama company
the work of the drama company came under continued criticism the welsh arts council cut its grant and the partnership ended in <year> with the formal closure of the welsh drama company
handel rodelinda <year> and martinů the greek passion <year> were added to the company 's repertoire and in <year> das rheingold was staged in the wno 's first ring cycle followed by the other three operas of the cycle over the next two years
das rheingold siegfried and götterdämmerung were conducted by the company 's musical director richard armstrong die walküre <year> was conducted by goodall it was seen as a coup for the company to secure his services – he was described by the guardian as the greatest living wagnerian conductor – but the casting of the whole cycle was criticised for some serious weaknesses among the principal singers and reviewers were generally unimpressed by göran järvefelt 's production
the chief executive brian mcmaster did not appoint a replacement to geliot as principal director during the <num> preferring to engage guest producers
boyd mentions andrei șerban 's eugene onegin <year> among the successes and lucian pintilie 's carmen <year> and ruth berghaus 's don giovanni <year> as productions that received more mixed responses
sir charles mackerras the conductor for don giovanni was open in his contempt for berghaus 's production
harry kupfer 's fidelio <year> was condemned by the daily telegraph as a piece of marxist polemic making political sport of beethoven 's work
mcmaster was thought by some too inclined to favour radical eastern european directors jonathan miller a leading english director commented that he did not intend to take bulgarian nationality although it was a must before brian pays any attention
armstrong stepped down in <year> after thirteen years as musical director he was succeeded by mackerras whose association with the company dated back more than thirty years
among the features of his six @-@ year tenure was an increasing use of surtitles for performances not given in english
in the company 's early days all operas had been sung in english but as more international stars began to appear as guest principals the language policy had to be reconsidered few of the leading names in world opera were interested in relearning their roles in english
wno steered a middle course between the practices of the two main london companies after the <num> the royal opera had generally given operas in the original language and english national opera was committed to opera in english
wno 's practice varied after its early years
examples from the <num> include wagner 's tristan und isolde sung in german and the ring in english and verdi 's the force of destiny given in english and otello in italian
mackerras was a strong advocate of performance in the original language with surtitles i can 't imagine a greater advance for opera
… what a gift it 's like siegfried understanding the woodbird
one of the last legacies of his tenure was the <year> production of debussy 's pelléas et mélisande directed by peter stein and conducted by pierre boulez
the new york times called wno one of the finest operatic ensembles in europe and noted that the first night of the debussy work in cardiff attracted <num> critics from all over the united kingdom and the continent
the most prestigious intensely awaited event of the british operatic season
the production was given at the théâtre du châtelet paris a few weeks afterwards
mcmaster was followed as chief executive by matthew epstein whose three years in charge <year> – <num> were described in a <year> study by paul atkinson as a less happy and less successful period
epstein was replaced by anthony freud under whom according to atkinson productions became consistently strong musically well prepared intelligently staged and well cast
mackerras was succeeded in <year> by carlo rizzi who was music director at the time of wno 's golden jubilee in <year>
when the occasion was marked with a new production of the cav and pag double bill that had launched the company in <year> the bbc commented that wno was one of the most respected opera companies in the world
in the observer michael ratcliffe called the company the most popular populist and consistently successful arts organisation ever to come out of wales
with the loyalty and affection of audiences in cardiff and across england … the people 's opera is not a myth
it happened here
the jubilee celebrations were overshadowed by the collapse of a plan for a purpose @-@ built home for the company the cardiff bay opera house
during the <num> wno made its proms debut with a complete performance of mozart 's idomeneo conducted by mackerras in <year>
the company played three short seasons at the royal opera house covent garden in the mid @-@ <num> featuring tristan und isolde and la favorita in <year> the yeomen of the guard in <year> and the rake 's progress and the jubilee double bill of cavalleria rusticana and pagliacci in <year>
a financial crisis had led to redundancies in the orchestra and the curtailment of the touring schedule the conservative works chosen for <year> – <num> were condemned by the press as the dullest programme in recent memory and rizzi was about to be replaced by a young and untried successor tugan sokhiev
rizzi had gained great respect and affection during his nine @-@ year term as musical director his successor 's reign was brief and unhappy
having taken up post in <year> sohkiev resigned precipitately the following year
rizzi agreed to reorganise his schedule and to public and critical acclaim returned to the musical directorship in time to prepare the company for its long @-@ awaited move into a permanent base in cardiff
after the collapse of the cardiff bay opera house scheme a new project the wales millennium centre met with more success
the necessary consents and funding were obtained and work began in <year> on a new multipurpose arts centre on the cardiff bay site
the centre included a <num> @,@ <num> @-@ seat theatre which among other uses became wno 's home base from <year> with its own rehearsal space and offices in the complex
in the first decade of the 21st century wno gave more than <num> performances a year with a repertoire generally of eight full @-@ scale operas
its regular audience figures totalled over <num> @,@ <num> annually in ten principal venues three of them in wales and seven in england
during this period the company was criticised for being insufficiently welsh
a local politician adam price said that wno ought to have a welsh musical director alun hoddinott said in <year> wno has put on perhaps four or five welsh operas over <num> years
they just seem to have an anti @-@ welsh music bias
i am sad that they do not do something for welsh composers especially young ones
a more positive view of wno came from scotland where the two main newspapers the scotsman and the herald greeted a visit from the company in <year> with enthusiastic praise contrasting the flourishing of opera in wales with its neglect by politicians in scotland and the consequent decline of scottish opera
in <year> wno commissioned gair ar gnawd word on flesh by pwyll ap siôn and menna elfyn with words in welsh described as a contemporary story about wales today
inspired by the translation of the bible
from <year> to <year> the chief executive titled artistic director was john fisher
his term overlapped with that of lothar koenigs who was musical director from <year> to <year>
a highlight of this period was the <year> production of die meistersinger produced by richard jones starring bryn terfel as hans sachs
the production won superlatives from reviewers
in <year> david pountney was appointed to succeed fisher as chief executive
he had worked with the company since the <num> most recently on a <year> the flying dutchman with terfel which was set in space
in <year> he programmed a trilogy of operas set in tudor england donizetti 's anna bolena maria stuarda and roberto devereux with another trilogy the following year on the theme of fallen women – puccini 's manon lescaut henze 's boulevard solitude and verdi 's la traviata
for <year> pountney scheduled another trilogy this time on the theme of figaro consisting of mozart 's the marriage of figaro and rossini 's the barber of seville and a new work figaro gets a divorce with music by elena langer and libretto by pountney
in september <year> wno announced the appointment of tomáš hanus as its next music director taking office for the <year> – <num> season
at the same time carlo rizzi was named the company 's conductor laureate with immediate effect
among those are tristan und isolde conducted by goodall <year> pelléas et mélisande conducted by boulez <year> the yeomen of the guard conducted by mackerras <year> the doctor of myddfai conducted by armstrong <year> and ariodante conducted by ivor bolton directed by david alden <year>
the bbc made a studio video recording of a wno cast in katya kabanova conducted by armstrong in <year>
the wno chorus and orchestra have been engaged for studio opera recordings unconnected with the company 's productions including hamlet <year> norma <year> anna bolena <year> ernani <year> and adriana lecouvreur <year> conducted by richard bonynge faust <year> and katya kabanova <year> conducted by rizzi and gloriana <year> eugene onegin <year> and jenůfa <year> conducted by mackerras
for the wno jubilee in <year> decca drew on some of its studio recordings for a celebratory cd set with contributions from many soloists who had appeared onstage with the company and some who had not the latter including joan sutherland luciano pavarotti montserrat caballe and thomas hampson

it was a popular rugby song at clubs during the <num> and <num> and was sung every year at twickenham during the end @-@ of @-@ season all @-@ day middlesex sevens tournament accompanied by risqué hand gestures that played on the double entendres of some of the words
during the <num> the twickenham crowd also sang it during england matches then coming into the last match of the <year> season against the irish england had lost <num> of their previous <num> matches in the five nations championship
the twickenham crowd had only seen one solitary england try in the previous two years and at half time against ireland they were <num> – <num> down

a group of boys from the benedictine school douai following a tradition at their school games sang the song on his final try and other spectators around the ground joined in
since then swing low sweet chariot became a song to sing at england home games in the same way that the fields of athenry is sung in dublin and cwm rhondda is sung at cardiff
it has since become the anthem of the team as in <year> the result of a plan of the then rfu marketing director mike coley for the team to launch a song leading up to that year 's rugby world cup
he had wanted to use jerusalem but it was used in the rugby league cup final that year so the song was changed at short notice to swing low

alfred wright an employee of the rugby football union is credited with the standardisation and new design of the rose which up until <year> had undergone many variations in its depiction

in <year> england first used a skin @-@ tight strip
this was intended to make it more difficult for the opposition to grasp the shirt when tackling
the home and away strips for <year> were unveiled on <num> may that year
the materials used are superior offering improved performance to the <year> kit
however a sweeping red mark on the base @-@ white front which forms st george 's cross on the top left and a changed away @-@ strip dark blue to red have received criticism because it is felt that emphasis has been placed on st george 's cross at the expense of the traditional red rose
the new strip was introduced in england 's home game against wales on <num> august while the alternative strip was first used against france on <num> august
the former england home strip was white with a strip of red around the neck and the away strip was black causing much controversy due to the famous all @-@ black kit of new zealand both kits had a ground breaking new technology in the form of a gripper print

a notable magnate and military commander with ruthenian and romanian origin wiśniowiecki was heir of one of the biggest fortunes of the state and rose to several notable dignities including the position of voivode of the ruthenian voivodship in <year>
his conversion from eastern orthodoxy to roman catholicism caused much dissent in ruthenia and ukraine parts of the polish – lithuanian commonwealth
wiśniowiecki was a successful military leader as well as one of the wealthiest magnates of poland ruling over lands inhabited by <num> @,@ <num> people
his father michał wiśniowiecki of the lithuanian @-@ ruthenian wiśniowiecki family died soon after jeremi 's birth in <year>
his mother regina mohyła raina mohylanka was a moldavian @-@ born noble woman of the movilești family daughter of the moldavian prince ieremia movilă jeremy 's namesake she died in <year>
both of his parents were of the eastern orthodox church rite jeremy 's uncle was the influential orthodox theologian peter mogila and his great @-@ uncle was george mogila the metropolitan of moldavia
orphaned at the age of seven wiśniowiecki was raised by his uncle konstanty wiśniowiecki whose branch of the family were roman catholics
jeremi attended a jesuit college in lwów and later in <year> he traveled to italy where he briefly attended the university of bologna
he also acquired some military experience in the netherlands
the upbringing by his uncle and the trips abroad polonized him and turned him from a provincial ruthenian princeling into one of the youngest magnates of the polish @-@ lithuanian commonwealth
in <year> wiśniowiecki returned to the commonwealth and took over from his uncle the management of his father 's huge estate which included a large part of what is now ukraine
in <year> he converted from eastern orthodoxy to catholicism an action that caused much concern in ukraine
his decision has been analyzed by historians and often criticized particularly in ukrainian historiography
the orthodox church feared to lose a powerful protector and isaiah kopinsky metropolitan bishop of kiev and a friend of his mother unsuccessfully plead with him to change his mind
jeremi would not budge although he remained on decent terms with the orthdox church avoiding provocative actions and supported his uncle and orthodox bishop peter mogila and his orthodox church collegium
the first of those was the smolensk campaign of <year> – <num> against the tsardom of russia
in that war he accompanied castellan aleksander piaseczyński 's southern army and took part in several battles among them the unsuccessful siege of putyvl later that year they took rylsk and sevsk before retreating
the following year he worked with adam kisiel and łukasz żółkiewski commanding his own private army of <num> @,@ <num>
as his troops formed <num> <num> of their army not counting supporting cossack elements jeremi despite being the most junior of commanders had much influence over their campaign
lacking in artillery they failed to take any major towns but ravaged the countryside near sevsk and kursk
the war ended soon afterward and in may <year> he returned to lubny
for his service he received a commendation from the king of poland władysław iv vasa and the castellany of kiev
after the war wiśniowiecki engaged in a number of conflicts with neighbouring magnates and nobles
jeremi was able to afford a sizable private army of several thousands and through the threat of it he was often able to force his neighbours to a favourable settlement of disputes
soon after his return from the russian front he participated on the side of the dowmont family in the quarrel over the estate of dowmontów against another magnate samuel łaszcz located on his lands soon after the victorious battle against łaszcz he bought the lands from the dowmonts and incorporated them into his estates
around <year> the sejm polish parliament opposed the marriage of king władysław iv waza to wiśniowiecki 's sister anna
following this jeremi distanced himself from the royal court although he periodically returned to warsaw usually as one of the deputies to the sejm from the ruthenian voivodeship
soon afterward jeremi himself married gryzelda zamoyska daughter of chancellor tomasz zamoyski on <num> february <year> on gryzelda 's <num> birthday
at that time wiśniowiecki also engaged in a political conflict over nobility titles in particular the title of prince kniaź
the nobility in the commonwealth was officially equal and used different and non @-@ hereditary titles then those found in rest of the world see officials of the polish @-@ lithuanian commonwealth the gist of the conflict which took much of the sejm 's time around <year> – <num> revolved around whether old prince titles awarded to families before their lands were incorporated into the commonwealth in the <year> union of lublin and the new titles awarded more recently by some foreign courts should be recognized
wiśniowiecki was one of the chief participants in this debate successfully defending the old titles including that of his own family and succeeding in abolishing the new titles which gained him the enmity of another powerful magnate jerzy ossoliński
other than this conflict in his years as a deputy <year> – <num> jeremi wasn 't involved in any major political issues and only twice in <year> and <year> he served in the minor function of a commissar for investigating the eastern and southern border disputes
in <year> wiśniowiecki might have fought under hetman mikołaj potocki against the cossack rebellion of pavel pavluk the pawluk uprising jan widacki notes that historians are not certain whether he did and in either case no detailed accounts of his possible participation survive
a year later returning from the sejm and from the engagement ceremony with gryzelda he gathered a <num> @,@ <num> strong division that participated in putting down of the ostrzanin uprising and arrived at the region affected by the unrest in june that year
together with hetman potocki he defeated the insurgents at the battle of żownin which turned into a rather difficult siege of the cossack camp that lasted from <num> june till the cossack relief forces were defeated on <num> august and the cossacks capitulated on <num> august
the conflict stemmed from the fact that konstanty asked jeremi to take care of his grandchildren but their mother katarzyna eugenia tyszkiewicz married aleksander who declared he is able and willing to take care of her children and their estates
a year later katarzyna eugenia decided to divorce aleksander and the matter was settled in favor of jeremi
wiśniowiecki also fought against the tatars in <year> – <num> whose raids on the south @-@ east frontier of the commonwealth endangered his holdings
in <year> together with hetman stanisław koniecpolski he took part in the victorious battle of ochmatów in which they crushed forces of crimean tatars led by toğay bey tuhaj bej
in <year> after the false news of the death of adam kazanowski wiśniowiecki took over his disputed estate of rumno by subterfuge
for this he was at first sentenced to exile but due to his influence even the king could not realistically expect to enforce this ruling without a civil war
eventually after more discussions at local sejmiks and then in the sejm he won the case and was granted the right for rumno
in <year> after the death of koniecpolski he became the voivode of ruthenia
he invaded and took over the town of hadiach which was also being claimed by a son of koniecpolski aleksander koniecpolski but a year later in <year> he lost that case and was forced to return the town
on <num> april <year> wiśniowiecki received the office of the voivode of ruthenia which granted him a seat in the senate of poland
he was the third member of the wiśniowiecki family to gain that privilege
soon afterward however he refused to support king władysław 's plan for a war against the ottoman empire even though the king offered him the rank of a field crown hetman
then the autumn of <year> wiśniowiecki invaded and took over the starostwo kaniowskie vacated recently by banished samuel łaszcz
he did so without any legal justifications which caused a court ruling against him a ruling that was however never enforced
later that year he raised a large private army of about <num> @,@ <num> for a purpose unknown as noted by widacki who writes that the army which jeremi raised with an immense cost for a short time did not participate in any engagement nor did it have any clear purpose
he notes that such an army might have been useful in provoking the ottomans but as jeremi was opposed to the war with them up to the point of refusing the hetman office his actions are puzzling even for the modern historians
he received information about a growing unrest and began mobilizing his troops and in early may learned about the cossack victory at the battle of zhovti vody
receiving no orders from hetmans mikołaj potocki and marcin kalinowski he began moving on his own soon learning about the second cossack victory at battle of korsuń which meant that his troops about <num> @,@ <num> strong were the only polish forces in transdnieper at that moment
after taking in the situation he began retreating towards chernihiv his army soon became a focal point for various refugees
passing chernihiv he continued through liubech to brahin
he continued to mazyr zhytomir and pohrebyshche stopping briefly in zhytomir for the local sejmik
after some skirmishes near nemyriv machnówka and starokostiantyniv battle of starokostiantyniv against the cossack forces
by july he would arrive near zbarazh
wiśniowiecki 's fighting retreat had a major impact on the course of the war
in the words of the historian władysław konopczyński he was not defeated not victorious and thus he made the peace more difficult
politicians in safe warsaw tried to negotiate with the cossacks who in turn used wisniowiecki 's actions as an excuse to delay any serious negotiations
around late august or early september wiśniowiecki met with the army regimentarzs władysław dominik zasławski @-@ ostrogski mikołaj ostroróg and aleksander koniecpolski
he was not on overly friendly terms with them as he resented being passed in military nominations but after short negotiations he agreed to follow their orders and thus reduced to a junior commander status which had little impact over the next phase of the campaign
on <num> september their forces were however defeated at the battle of pyliavtsi near the end of the battle some accounts suggest wiśniowiecki was offered the hetman 's position but refused
on <num> september in lviv wiśniowiecki with popular support was given a field regimentarz nomination about a week later this nomination was confirmed by the sejm
to the anger of lviv 's townfolk he decided to focus on retreating towards the key fortress in zamość instead of lviv he would leave garrisons on both towns and keep his army in the field
in the end the cities were not captured by the cossacks who in the light of the coming winter decided to retreat after being paid a ransom by both town councils no other large field battle toke place that year
meanwhile the convocation sejm of <year> had elected a new king jan kazimierz ii vasa
wiśniowiecki supported other candidates such as george i rákóczi and karol ferdynand vasa jan kazimierz 's brother
due to the opposition from jeremi 's detractors he was not granted a hetman position although after a full two days of debate on the subject he was granted a document that stated he had a power equal to that of a hetman
wiśniowiecki faction arguing for increase in army size was once again marginalized by the faction that hoped for a peaceful resolution
in the end the king and most of the szlachta were lulled into a false sense of security and the military was not reinforced significantly
to add an insult to an injury the coronation sejm of january – february <year> held in kraków revoked wiśniowieck 's regimentarz rank
in the first half of <year> the negotiations with the cossacks fell through and the polish @-@ lithuanian military begun gathering near the borders with the rebellious ukraine a major camp was in zbarazh where wiśniowiecki would arrive as well in late june after gathering a new army of <num> @,@ <num> in wiśnicz which was all he was able to afford at that time as due to most of his estates being overrun by the cossacks
wiśniowiecki 's arrival raised the morale of the royal army and despite having no official rank both the common soldiers and the new regimentarz promised to take his advice and even offered him the official command which he refused
during the siege of zbarazh wiśniowiecki was thus not the official commander role was taken by regimentarz andrzej firlej but most historians agree he was the real if unofficial commander of the polish @-@ lithuanian army
the siege would last until the ceasefire of the treaty of zboriv
wiśniowiecki 's command during the siege was seen as phenomenal and his popularity among the troops and nobility rose again however the king still not fond of him gave him a relatively small reward the land grant of starostwo przasnyskie much less when compared to several others he distributed around that time
needing wiśniowiecki 's support in december that year the king granted him once again a temporary hetman nomination and several more land grants
in april <year> wiśniowiecki had to return his temporary hetman office to mikołaj potocki recently released from cossack 's captivity
during december that year in light of the growing tensions with muscovy 's wiśniowiecki 's military faction succeeded in convincing the sejm to pass a resolution increasing the size of the army to <num> @,@ <num> the largest army since the cossack unrest begun two years ago
the truce of zborov did not last long and in the spring of <year> khmelnytsky 's cossacks begun advancing west again
on june <num> <year> wiśniowiecki brought his private army to face the cossacks in sokal
he commanded the left wing of the polish @-@ lithuanian army in the victorious battle of berestechko on <num> – <num> june
the polish @-@ lithuanian army advanced after the retreating cossacks but on july <num> the king left the whole army to potocki
and having given the order that the army march into ukraine the king himself parted
to warsaw to celebrate his victories over the cossacks
later that year on <num> august wiśniowiecki suddenly fell ill while in a camp near the village of pawołocz and died on august <num> <year> at the age of only <num>
his cause of death was never known while some even contemporaries speculated he was poisoned but no conclusive evidence to support such a claim have ever been found
based on sparse descriptions of his illness and subsequent investigations some medical historians suggest the cause of death might have been a disease related to cholera
however one account states following a cheerful conversation with other officers who had congregated for a military council in his tent on sunday <num> august n
s
he had eaten some cucumbers with zest and washed them down with mead and from that contracted dysentery
after lying ill for a week he died there at pavoloch
he was given a ceremonial funeral with the entire army present
on august <num> wiśniowiecki 's body was seen off with the utmost pomp on its journey to his residence
wiśniowiecki 's indebted family was not able to provide him with a funeral his rank and fame deserved
in the end he never received the large funeral and the temporary location of his body the monastery of the holy cross at łysa góra became his final resting place
his body was lost in the fire at the end of the <num> century which also prevents a modern reexamination of the cause of his death
the capital of his estate was located at a fortified manor at lubny where his father rebuilt an old castle the population of the town itself could be estimated at about <num> @,@ <num>
wiśniowiecki inherited lands inhabited according to an estimate from <year> by about <num> @,@ <num> people of which lubny was the largest town
smaller towns in his lands included khorol piratyn and przyłuka
by <year> his lands were inhabited by <num> @,@ <num> people
the number of towns on his lands rose from several to about thirty and their population increased as well
the prosperity of those lands reflected wiśniowiecki 's skills in economic management and the income from his territories estimated at about <num> @,@ <num> zloties yearly made him one of the wealthiest magnates in the commonwealth
because of its size and relatively consistent borders wiśniowiecki 's estate was often named wiśniowieczczyzna wiśniowieckiland
despite his wealth he was not known for a lavish life
his court of about a hundred people was not know for being overly extravagant he built no luxurious residences and did not even have a single portrait of himself made during his life
it is uncertain how wiśniowiecki looked although a number of portraits and other works depicting him exist
jan widacki notes that much of the historiography concerning wiśniowiecki focuses on the military and political aspects of his life and few of his critics discuss his successes in the economic development of his estates
he was praised by many of his contemporaries including a poet samuel twardowski as well as numerous diary writers and early historians
for his protection of civilian population including jews during the uprising wiśniowiecki has been commended by early jewish historians
until the <num> century he has been idolized as the legendary perfect knight of the borderlands his sculpture is among the twenty sculpture of famous historical personas in the <num> century knight room of the royal warsaw castle
in the <num> century this image begun to waver as a new wave in historiography begun to reinterpret his life and as the era of positivism in poland put more value on builders and less on warriors
further at that time the polish historians begun to question the traditional view of the ukrainian problem and the way that the polish noble class had dealt with the cossacks
slowly wiśniowiecki 's image as a hero began to waver with various aspects of his life and personality being questioned and criticized in the work of historians such as karol szajnocha and józef szujski
while wiśniowiecki 's portrayal as a major secondary character in the first part of henryk sienkiewicz 's trilogy with fire and sword which describes the history of the polish @-@ lithuanian commonwealth during the uprising was rather positive criticism of his persona intensified in particular from sienkiewicz detractors such as zygmunt kaczkowski and olgierd górka
the <num> saw a first modern historical work about wiśniowiecki by władysław tomkiewicz
in the era of the people 's republic of poland the communist party 's ideology dictated that all historians present him as an enemy of the people although this began to be relaxed after <year>
widacki analyzing the work of other historians notes that władysław czapliński was rather sympathetic to wiśniowiecki while paweł jasienica was critical of him
wiśniowiecki has made appearances in more recent media
he was the main subject of one of jacek kaczmarski 's <year> songs kniazia jaremy nawrócenie the conversion of knyaz jarema
andrzej seweryn played jeremi wiśniowiecki in the <year> film with fire and sword

brown also declares you heard about my image but i could give a flying motherfuck who 's offended
hayley avron of contactmusic

hazel robinson of california literary review magazine noted that the word bassline is a metaphor for penis
sam wilbur of aol radio viewed it as the best example of dubstep tracks on fortune while kyle anderson of entertainment weekly noted it as one of the album 's best tracks

she participated in the pursuit of goeben and breslau
following the escape of the two german ships to neutral turkey black prince and duke of edinburgh were sent into the red sea to search for german merchant ships with black prince capturing the german ocean liners südmark and istria
on <num> november she was ordered to gibraltar to join a squadron of french and british ships to search for german warships still at sea off the african coast
this was cancelled on <num> november after the location of the german east asia squadron was revealed by survivors of the battle of coronel

the circumstances under which she sank were mysterious for some years after
as the british had lost contact and did not see the ship destroyed they were unsure as to whether a submarine or surface ship was responsible for sinking black prince
during the battle the 1st cruiser squadron was deployed as part of a screening force several miles ahead of the main force of the grand fleet but black prince lost contact with the rest of the squadron as it came into contact with german forces at about <num> <num>
soon after two other members of the 1st cruiser squadron defence and warrior were heavily engaged by german battleships and battlecruisers with defence blowing up and warrior receiving heavy damage which later caused her to sink
there were no positive sightings of black prince by the british fleet after that although a wireless signal from her was received at <num> <num> reporting a submarine sighting
during the night of <num> may – <num> june the british destroyer spitfire badly damaged after colliding with the german battleship nassau sighted what appeared to be a german battlecruiser with two widely spaced funnels described as being
a mass of fire from foremast to mainmast on deck and between decks
flames were issuing out of her from every corner
the mystery ship exploded at about midnight
it was later thought that the burning ship may have been black prince with the two midships funnels having collapsed or been shot away
recent historians however hold to the german account of the ship 's sinking
black prince briefly engaged the german battleship rheinland at about <num> <num> gmt scoring two hits with <num> @-@ inch shells
separated from the rest of the british fleet black prince approached the german lines at approximately midnight
she turned away from the german battleships but it was too late
the german battleship thüringen fixed black prince in her searchlights and opened fire

with her public recitation angelou became the second poet in history to read a poem at a presidential inauguration and the first african american and woman
robert frost was the first inaugural poet at the <year> inauguration of john f
kennedy
angelou 's audio recording of the poem won the <year> grammy award in the best spoken word category resulting in more fame and recognition for her previous works and broadening her appeal
the poem 's themes are change inclusion responsibility and role of both the president and the citizenry in establishing economic security
its symbols references to contemporary issues and personification of nature has inspired critics to compare on the pulse of morning with frost 's inaugural poem and with clinton 's inaugural address
it has been called angelou 's autobiographical poem and has received mixed reviews
the popular press praised clinton 's choice of angelou as inaugural poet and her representiveness of the american people and its president
critic mary jane lupton said that angelou 's ultimate greatness will be attributed to the poem and that angelou 's theatrical performance of it using skills she learned as an actor and speaker marked a return to the african @-@ american oral tradition of speakers such as frederick douglass martin luther king jr
and malcolm x
poetry critics despite praising angelou 's recitation and performance gave mostly negative reviews of the poem
she had written five of the seven of her series of autobiographies including the first and most highly acclaimed i know why the caged bird sings <year>
although she was best known for her autobiographies she was primarily known as a poet rather than an autobiographer
early in her writing career she began alternating the publication of an autobiography and a volume of poetry
her first volume of poetry just give me a cool drink of water fore i diiie published in <year> shortly after caged bird became a best @-@ seller and was nominated for a pulitzer prize
as scholar marcia ann gillespie writes angelou had fallen in love with poetry during her early childhood in stamps arkansas
after her rape at the age of eight which she depicted in caged bird angelou memorized and studied great works of literature including poetry
according to caged bird her friend mrs
flowers encouraged her to recite them which helped bring her out her self @-@ imposed period of muteness caused by her trauma
angelou was the first poet to read an inaugural poem since robert frost read his poem the gift outright at president john f
kennedy 's inauguration in <year> and the first black and woman
when it was announced that angelou would read one of her poems at clinton 's inauguration many in the popular press compared her role as inaugural poet with that of frost 's especially what critic zofia burr called their representativeness or their ability to speak for and to the american people
the press also pointed to the nation 's social progress that a black woman would stand in the place of a white man at his inauguration and praised angelou 's involvement as the clinton administration 's gesture of inclusion
angelou told her friend oprah winfrey that the call requesting her to write and recite the poem came from television producer harry thomason who organized the inauguration shortly after clinton 's election
even though she suspected that clinton made the request because he understood that i am the kind of person who really does bring people together angelou admitted feeling overwhelmed and even requested that the audiences attending her speaking engagements pray for her
she followed her same writing ritual that she had followed for years and used in writing all of her books and poetry she rented a hotel room closeted herself there from the early morning to the afternoon and wrote on legal pads
after deciding upon the theme america she wrote down everything she could think of about the country which she then pushed and squeezed into a poetic form
angelou recited the poem on january <num> <year>
the symbols in angelou 's poem the tree the river and the morning for example paralleled many of the same symbols clinton used in his speech and helped to enhance and expand clinton 's images
clinton 's address and the poem according to hagen both emphasized unity despite the diversity of american culture
on the pulse of morning attempted to convey many of the goals of clinton 's new administration
burr compared angelou 's poem with frost 's something she claimed the poetry critics who gave on the pulse of morning negative reviews did not do
angelou rewrote frost 's poem from the perspective of personified nature that appeared in both poems
frost praised american colonization but angelou attacked it
the cost of the creation of america was abstract and ambiguous in frost 's poem but the personified tree in angelou 's poem signified the cultures in america that paid a significant cost to create it
both frost and angelou called for a break with the past but frost wanted to relive it and angelou wanted to confront its mistakes
burr also compared angelou 's poem with audre lorde 's poem for each of you which has similar themes of looking towards the future as well as with walt whitman 's song of myself and langston hughes the negro speaks of rivers
according to hagen the poem contains a recurring theme in many of angelou 's other poems and autobiographies that we are more alike than unalike
on the pulse of morning was full of contemporary references including toxic waste and pollution
angelou 's poem was influenced by the african @-@ american oral tradition of spirituals by poets such as james weldon johnson and langston hughes and by modern african poets and folk artists such as kwesi brew and efua sutherland which also influenced her autobiographies
lupton has argued that angelou 's ultimate greatness will be attributed to the poem and that angelou 's theatrical performance of it using skills she learned as an actor and speaker marked a return to the african @-@ american oral tradition of speakers such as frederick douglass martin luther king jr
and malcolm x
british reporter kate kellaway compared angelou 's appearance as she read the poem at clinton 's inauguration with the eight @-@ year @-@ old child in caged bird noting that the coats she wore in both occasions were similar she looked magnificent sternly theatrical with an unsmiling bow mouth
she wore a coat with brass buttons a strange reminder of the eight @-@ year @-@ old maya angelou who stood in a courtroom terrified at the sight of the man who had raped her
gillespie stated regarding kellaway 's observations but standing tall on the steps of the capitol she was light @-@ years removed from that terrible time and america was no longer an unfriendly place
her poem on the pulse of morning was a soaring call for peace justice and harmony
capturing the hope embodied in the human spirit it was a solemn and joyful reminder that all things are possible
she wished us good morning in her poem and one felt as if a new day was truly dawning
angelou recognized that although on the pulse of morning was a better public poem than a great poem her goal of conveying the message of unity was accomplished
poet david lehman agreed stating that although it fulfilled its theatrical and political objectives the poem was not very memorable
poet sterling d
plumpp found angelou 's performance brilliant but was not as enthusiastic about it as a text
burr stated that the negative reviews of angelou 's poem like the majority of the reviews about her other poetry was due to their elitism and narrow views of poetry which were limited to written forms rather than spoken ones like on the pulse of morning which was written to recite aloud and perform
burr compared the response of literary critics to angelou 's poem with critics of frost 's poem frost 's powerful reading served to supplement the poem in the sense of enhancing it while angelou 's powerful reading of her poem supplemented it in the sense of making evident its inadequacy and lack
angelou 's recitation of on the pulse of morning resulted in more fame and recognition for her previous works and broadened her appeal across racial economic and educational boundaries
the week after angelou 's recitation sales of the paperback version of her books and poetry rose by <num> – <num> percent
bantam books had to reprint <num> @,@ <num> copies of all her books to keep up with the demand
random house which published angelou 's hardcover books and published the poem later that year reported that they sold more of her books in january <year> than they did in all of <year> accounting for a <num> percent increase
the sixteen @-@ page publication of the poem became a best @-@ seller and the recording of the poem was awarded a grammy award
it is the product of his late <num> <num> @-@ month ethnographic study of a <num> @-@ person christian fundamentalist baptist school in illinois
he describes the k – <num> day school 's function as a total institution that educates about a singular truth god 's will and subordination before god
the final chapter is a comparative analysis of the school and other schools institutions and social movements wherein peshkin concludes that the school is divisive in american society for promoting intolerance towards religious plurality the very condition that permits the school 's existence
reviewers wrote that peshkin 's account was fair and praised his decision to let the participants speak for themselves through quotations
they also noted that the book filled a literary lacuna in scholarly understanding of the rapidly expanding and understudied fundamentalist christian school
it is a profile of an illinois christian fundamentalist school — its policies practices and participants
peshkin then professor of education at the university of illinois at urbana – champaign intended his account to be both impartial and empathetic
he presents the fundamentalists as disciplined dedicated and determined with formulas for success opposite fragmented and defensive detractors
they believe in one truth — god 's plan — and reject philosophies of multiple truths
a teacher told peshkin that their job is to prepare students for this one pattern of thought
in turn the community 's constituents do not wish to leave but appreciate conformity as an end in itself
peshkin describes the school as a total institution a place where many similar people live by their own formal rules apart from outside society as based on erving goffman 's <year> essay
peshkin asserts that this was a natural conclusion from a school based on absolute truth
god 's choice was the third book in his series of studies on school – community relationships
it was published by the university of chicago press
in <year> peshkin moved to an illinois community of <num> @,@ <num> people that he pseudonymically called hartney where he stayed and observed for <num> months
he lived in an apartment within the home of a family associated with what he called the bethany baptist church
peshkin studied their <num> @-@ student k – <num> christian day school bethany baptist academy also a pseudonym
the school opened six years prior with <num> students and was one of over one thousand members of the american association of christian schools
the study focuses on the <num> students in the junior – senior high school
after a semester peshkin began to interview the community members and used their quotes to let them speak for themselves
the book includes eight portraits of students — four from faith and four scorners who consciously deviate — as well as student and teacher survey data displayed in <num> tables
an appendix includes course offerings and a bibliography
peshkin 's findings show a total world where the lessons of religion and education are intertwined into an interrelated interdependent philosophy
the academy 's intent is to make christian professionals as what peshkin describes as a vocational school directed to work in the lord 's service
when compared to the work of public schools the private school 's instructors said both kinds of institutions impose a lifestyle and set of values as a kind of brainwashing
peshkin notes that while students largely identify with and uphold the fundamentalist teachings they permit themselves the option of having individual interpretations and minor beliefs
some students either dissent against the academy 's rules or are regarded as too pious but most students are moderate
students take classes to be effective christian leaders including bible study and soul @-@ winning english speech drama and music which are seen as important to read and proclaim the word
academy teachers establish their authority through discipline and teach the truth as established by facts from the bible
bible passages are associated with the subject matter in a process called integration
the academy uses science books from bob jones university as an alternative to books that promote secular humanism which is described as the official religion of the public school system
the bob jones science books associate the bible with science and often comment the relationship between god 's intelligence and the intricacies of nature
classes like science social studies and math are viewed as less important for the goal of making christian professionals apart from their training to do everything a sinner can do better
some classes are memorization and recitation -focused reflecting an inelastic view of knowledge which the academy believes to be fixed as based in biblical inerrancy
their biggest external influence on curriculum is new books which may affect how classes are taught though the content the truth remains the same
in a chapter on teacher selection and training the task of socializing students with obedience and discipline takes precedence over the task of teaching content
students are under constant supervision to uphold a pledge to avoid outside activities such as theater fashion dances and certain television shows
they also avoid some activities altogether such as sexualized contact drugs alcohol and smoking
this pledge is to be upheld at home as well and students are encouraged to report errancies
teachers too pledge to prioritize the pursuit of holiness over all things in a born again activity where they confess their sins and accept jesus christ as their personal savior
the school is unapologetic in its insistence on telling the kids what is right and its according preference for lecture over discussion
teachers are also afforded the option of corporal punishment though it is rarely used
the last two chapters feature peshkin 's commentary on the school in society its tradeoffs and comparison with other total institutions and larger social movements like the new religious right
he also compares the academy to public and parochial schools wherein he finds public school students more politically tolerant and acceptant of religious pluralism
peshkin 's final reflections are written as a cost @-@ benefit analysis of these christian schools in the larger american society
in the last chapter peshkin contemplates how his jewish identity is insulated within a pluralistic and secular society and how he is fearful of absolutist imperious implacable logic and zeal for conversion and exclusivism
he recounted that while the school spoke derogatorily of non @-@ fundamentalists and non @-@ christians no one spoke of the american religious plurality that permitted this
in response to the encroaching state fundamentalists feel that their political conviction should mirror that of their religion
peshkin views the school as schismatic in a larger society for promoting intolerance towards fellow americans
he also praised traits of the schools including its community dedicated teachers and attractive image
at the time of print christian schools like bethany were outpacing the growth of other schools
in <year> christian schools comprised about <num> of private school enrollment — around <num> @,@ <num> students
they also noted how the book filled a gap in the field and that his final chapter was too moralistic
r
scott appleby american journal of education wrote that peshkin succeeded at his attempt to be impartial and that his presentation of fundamentalist culture is made both understandable and in part admirable
he reflected that this christian pedagogy was closer to indoctrination than education in that it did not develop critical skills and
human capacities in open @-@ ended learning but professed a fixed chain of knowledge from on high where humans are errant and need authoritarian guidance
appleby added that fundamentalism blames public schools and its associated state apparatus as both a manufacturer enemy needed to feed its sense of crisis and for creating unsafe areas unregulated by christian truth
sociologist susan rose broadens the base of god 's choice in her <year> keeping them out of the hands of satan and appleby writes that the two books compliment each other 's lacunae
while god 's choice has an engaging sometimes riveting narrative with vivid characters but little outside information apart from statistics keeping them out of the hands of satan includes extra detail on how fundamentalist groups interact and share a larger societal milieu
for example rose explains the difference in born @-@ again experiences of evangelicals and fundamentalists which peshkin glosses over
in her own review of peshkin 's book rose contemporary sociology praised its clear and detailed contribution to the field but wished for more overview material on the christian school movement 's rise proponents philosophical consistency and sociohistorical context
she wrote that few had studied christian schools the fastest growing sector of private education in the united states
in commending peshkin 's even @-@ handedness she wrote that his forthrightness about declaring his own biases and effort to present participant voices through direct quotation were strong elements though he described more than he analyzed
rose felt that the interesting final chapters of analysis and comparison with public schools grounded the overall ethnography though she wished for more comparison of the adolescent student experience between the academy and other kinds of american schools
she considers peshkin 's discussion of the politics of pluralism that christian schools both add to american religious pluralism while advocating against it possibly his best contribution
jean holm the times higher education supplement too noted the fast growth of conservative christian schools but added that the book was also relevant in britain which was experiencing similar growth
she found the first few chapters somewhat repetitive as it expressed the uniformity of the school 's practices
richard v
pierard christian century felt that peshkin wrote with deeply respect for the school and its community but pierard himself an evangelical was disturbed by the community 's indoctrinated values — biblical absolutes that are part of a conservative program that has been read into scripture
paul f
parsons christianity today noted that peshkin found the school successful by traditional terms with standardized tests orderly climate and fun @-@ loving students but lacking free exchange of ideas as education is seen more as a transfer than a quest and students do not learn choice doubt suspended judgment or dissent
parsons affirmed peshkin 's findings as remarkably representative based on his own visits to christian schools in <num> cities though others are less absolutist
and while julian mcallister groves journal of contemporary ethnography described the text as beautifully written and poetic he doubted whether the school 's students were as converted as they said and felt that peshkin might have seen more role distance and examples of playing along simply for community acceptance had he stayed for lunch and other informal observations
primary elections were held to determine the nominees for the democratic party and republican party on september <num>
incumbent mayor kurt schmoke a democrat opted not to run for reelection
martin o 'malley a member of the baltimore city council won the election to succeed schmoke
because baltimore 's electorate is overwhelmingly democratic whoever won the democratic primary election was seen as the favorite over the republican nominee in the general election
baltimore 's large african american population initially made it seem likely that the next mayor would also be african american
kweisi mfume was the preferred candidate of local politicians but he opted not to run
though carl stokes and lawrence bell members of the city council declared for the race local leaders were underwhelmed with the quality of declared candidates
in <year> baltimore experienced high rates of murder and unemployment and had a failing city school system
o 'malley declared his candidacy focusing his campaign on a zero tolerance approach to crime
he received endorsements from many of the city 's african american leaders
after a close race o 'malley overtook both stokes and bell to win the democratic nomination which all but assured him of victory in the general election
he defeated republican candidate david f
tufaro in the general election by an overwhelming majority
he announced in december <year> that he would not run for reelection the following year the first time an incumbent baltimore mayor did not run for reelection since <year>
schmoke was the first african american mayor in baltimore 's history
racial politics had long played a role in baltimore
as the state of maryland did not attempt to prevent african americans from voting through jim crow laws political coalitions often involved african american community leaders
theodore mckeldin who served as mayor from <year> through <year> and from <year> through <year> was one of the first political leaders to work with african american community leaders
by <year> <num> of baltimore 's registered voters were african american and <num> were registered to the democratic party
baltimore had not elected a republican mayor since <year>
as of <year> baltimore experienced <num> murders a year which was the fourth most in the nation
unemployment was <num> twice the national average
between <year> and <year> baltimore saw its population decrease by <num>
<num> the second @-@ biggest decrease during that time period in the united states
this decrease led to its work force decreasing by one @-@ sixth
the city saw decreases in heavy @-@ manufacturing by <num> percent distribution jobs by <num> percent retail positions by <num> percent and banking jobs by <num> percent
also the state of maryland had taken over the city 's failing school system in <year> which upset african american politicians
state senator clarence m
mitchell iv called the takeover racist
baltimore city council members including president lawrence bell and martin o 'malley had opposed the handling of baltimore 's high crime rate by schmoke and baltimore police department bpd commissioner thomas c
frazier
other potential candidates included state 's attorney patricia jessamy former city councilman carl stokes city comptroller joan pratt and joan carter conway a member of the maryland state senate
city leaders including howard p
rawlings a member of the maryland house of delegates and william donald schaefer the comptroller of maryland and schmoke 's predecessor as mayor feared that none of the potential candidates had the vision to continue the urban renewal that took place under schmoke and schaefer
they hoped that baltimore @-@ native kweisi mfume the president of the national association for the advancement of colored people naacp would run
mfume had previously served on the baltimore city council and in the united states house of representatives
schmoke called the race his to lose
however mfume lived in nearby catonsville maryland and did not move into baltimore until march which would leave him short of the one year residency requirement
the state legislature passed a law shortening the residency requirement from one year to six months which was signed into law by democratic governor parris glendening in april
bell attempted to have the legislation overturned
the city council with schmoke 's support considered raising the salary of the mayor in april to make the position more enticing to mfume
also <num> baltimore citizens including three former mayors attempted to draft mfume into the race
however mfume had signed a five @-@ year contract with the naacp in <year>
mfume considered leaving the naacp to run but in may decided to remain with the organization
stokes announced his candidacy in december <year>
bell announced his candidacy two days after mfume passed on running in may <year> promising to tackle crime and improve public safety
community leaders who attempted to draft mfume into the race began to back stokes
other declared candidates included mary conaway the city register of wills activists a
robert kaufman robert marsili and phillip brown
jessamy stated that without mfume in the race she would consider running but she opted against getting into the race
a june <year> poll conducted by gonzales arscott communications inc
a polling firm based in annapolis maryland showed schaefer ahead of bell
schaefer stated that he had no interest in running and threw his support behind bishop robinson the former bpd commissioner
robinson chose not to run
o 'malley initially supported bell 's candidacy
bell urged o 'malley to endorse him and offered him the job of city solicitor in exchange for his support
however o 'malley began to distance himself from bell not appearing at bell 's campaign announcement due to disagreements on several bills debated at the city council
bell 's supporters attempted to convince o 'malley to run for city council president but o 'malley announced his decision to run for mayor in june becoming the first major candidate in the race who was caucasian
he began the campaign largely unknown outside of northeast baltimore
tufaro a real estate developer and lawyer from roland park maryland announced his intention to run for the republican party nomination joining three neighborhood activists who had already declared their intentions to run
carl adair a public school teacher who had run unsuccessfully for the city council and the maryland house of delegates on numerous occasions was also a candidate for the republican nomination
republican party officials quickly began to back tufaro who criticized the democratic party by pointing out that democrats have led baltimore in its decline
the front @-@ runners were considered to be o 'malley bell and stokes
schmoke made no endorsement in the race
o 'malley and bell called for zero tolerance to all crime though stokes felt this policy was biased against minorities
stokes ran on the issue of education as he was a former member of the baltimore school board in addition to the city council
stokes vowed to reduce class sizes and reverse the trend of citizens of baltimore leaving the city to live in nearby suburbs
o 'malley faced initial difficulties based on race as a community leader stated that his entrance into the race created some tension and that o 'malley 's potential victory would be the worst thing that could happen in this city and could tear this city apart
some saw his entrance in the race as an attempt to split the african american vote
however o 'malley received endorsements from prominent african american politicians in august including rawlings fellow state delegate kenneth montague and conway
rawlings credited o 'malley 's track record of empowering black americans
he also received an endorsement from schaefer
some african americans charged rawlings with stabbing us in the back over the endorsement
bell attempted to portray himself as the heir apparent to schmoke
however disclosures from a lawsuit revealed bell 's financial troubles which included having his car repossessed
bell lost support after he stated that voters should choose him because i look like you
stokes began to lose support after he was charged with lying about having a college degree when it was discovered that he did not graduate from loyola university maryland as his campaign literature stated
it was also revealed that stokes settled an income tax lien
bell 's supporters rallied outside the offices of the baltimore sun challenging that they were writing negative stories about african american candidates and giving better treatment to o 'malley during the campaign
stokes was able to recover support when he received endorsements from the baltimore sun the baltimore afro @-@ american and the ministerial alliance
bell led stokes in a poll conducted early in the race <num> to <num> before o 'malley declared his candidacy
by late august bell slipped in the polls to third place with o 'malley and stokes tied
bell and o 'malley began airing television commercials supporting their campaigns in early august while stokes did not begin to air commercials until september
o 'malley also advertised on the radio
seven candidates including democrats bell stokes o 'malley and conaway and republicans adair tufaro and arthur cuffie jr
met for a debate on september <num>
the debate focused on crime with bell stokes and o 'malley making their cases regarding zero tolerance while adair and tufaro declared their support for frazier
turnout was high though the mayoral candidates expected about <num> @,@ <num> voters about half of baltimore 's <num> @,@ <num> registered voters voted in the primary elections
o 'malley won the primary election with more than <num> of the vote though he received only <num> of the african american vote
bell and stokes split a significant portion of the city 's black majority but their combined total was less than o 'malley
at his victory rally o 'malley called the election a victory for diversity and a victory for inclusiveness
adair finished in second place
he pointed to bret schundler the mayor of jersey city new jersey as evidence that a republican could be elected in a heavily democratic city
schundler came to baltimore to campaign for tufaro
regarding public housing tufaro called for renovations rather than demolishing vacant buildings which drew criticism as housing commissioner daniel p
henson iii pointed out that renovating was more expensive than demolishing
o 'malley promised to enforce provisions of the community reinvestment act of <year> which require banks to invest in poor neighborhoods
tufaro further proposed a plan for school vouchers and to drug test students which drew opposition from the baltimore teachers union and from o 'malley who favored expanding pre @-@ kindergarten and after @-@ school programs while making summer school mandatory
when discussing the problem of hiv aids in baltimore which disproportionately affects african americans both o 'malley and tufaro promised to continue the city 's needle exchange program
tufaro criticized o 'malley 's zero tolerance policy suggesting it would lead to increased police brutality towards minorities
he instead proposed continuing mayor schmoke 's community policing strategy
opponents of the zero tolerance policy tried to tie o 'malley to the baltimore police shooting of an african american car theft suspect
wmar @-@ tv conducted the only poll of the general election with surveyusa which showed o 'malley leading with <num> of the vote
on election day o 'malley easily defeated tufaro in the general election receiving over <num> of the vote
o 'malley had his transition team and had them compile policy drafts by mid @-@ december so they would be ready to compete for state funds when the maryland state legislature reconvened on january <num> <year>
he participated in the newly elected mayors program at the john f
kennedy school of government in mid @-@ november
by the beginning of december he named five deputy mayors and filled most of his cabinet
he finalized his cabinet on december <num> during his last session as a city councillor
he was sworn in as mayor later that day at the war memorial plaza near baltimore city hall
in his first year in office o 'malley adopted a statistics @-@ based crime tracking system called citistat modeled after compstat
the system logged every call for service into a database for analysis
the washington post wrote in <year> that baltimore 's homicide rate remains stubbornly high and its public school test scores disappointingly low
but citistat has saved an estimated <num> million and helped generate the city 's first budget surplus in years
in <year> citistat accountability tool won harvard university 's innovations in american government award
the system garnered interest from washington d
c
mayor adrian fenty as well as crime officials from the united kingdom
o 'malley considered a run for governor of maryland in the <year> election but decided not to run
he was reelected as mayor of baltimore in <year> and announced his candidacy for governor in the <year> election
the baltimore sun endorsed o 'malley saying when he was first elected mayor in <year> the former two @-@ term city councilman inherited a city of rising crime failing schools and shrinking economic prospects
he was able to reverse course in all of these areas
the washington post criticized o 'malley for not solv ing the problems of rampant crime and rough schools in baltimore but further said that he put a dent in them

o 'malley defeated incumbent governor bob ehrlich <num> <num> in the november <num> <year> general election
o 'malley defeated ehrlich in the <year> election <num> <num> receiving just over one million votes
o 'malley was ineligible to run in the <year> gubernatorial election due to term limits
o 'malley publicly expressed interest in a presidential run in <year> on multiple occasions
at a press conference at a national governors association meeting o 'malley stated he was laying the framework for a presidential run
many saw the connection between o 'malley and the character of tommy carcetti a caucasian baltimore city councillor who is elected mayor in an election against two african american opponents
carlos watson of msnbc once introduced o 'malley as one of the real @-@ life inspirations for the mayor of the hit tv show the wire to which o 'malley responded that he was instead the show 's antidote
show creator david simon denied that the character of tommy carcetti was supposed to be o 'malley though he did acknowledge that o 'malley was one of several inspirations for carcetti
he further stated that while carcetti was reflective of o 'malley carcetti was a composite drawing aspects from other local politicians that he had covered when he worked as a reporter for the baltimore sun
it is <num> kilometres <num>
<num> mi from the capital pondicherry of the indian territory of puducherry
sir mortimer wheeler <year> and jean @-@ marie casal conducted achaeological excavations there in <year> – <year>
the site was identified as the port of podouke known as an emporium in the periplus of the erythraean sea and ptolemy
digs have found amphorae arretine ware roman lamps glassware glass and stone beads and gems at the site
based on these excavations wheeler concluded that the arikamedu was a greek yavana trading post that traded with rome starting during the reign of augustus caesar and lasted about two hundred years — from the late first century bce to the first and second centuries ce
subsequent investigation by vimala begley from <year> to <year> modified this assessment and now place the period of occupation from the <num> century bce to the <num> century ce
significant findings at arikamedu indlcude numerous indo @-@ pacific beads which facilitated fixing the period of its origin
red and black ceramics — known as megalithic stones or pandukal in tamil meaning old stones and used to mark graves — have existed at the site even prior to and during roman occupation of the site and also in later periods
<num> mi from pondicherry on the pondicherry @-@ cuddalore road it was originally a french colonial town
it is located on the bank of the ariyankuppam river for most part of the year the river is considered a lagoon also known as virampattinam river which forms the northern outlet of the gingee river as it joins the bay of bengal
as the site is located at the bend of the river it provides protection to sea @-@ going vessels that dock there
the site has been subject to extensive archaeological excavations
the archaeological site is spread over an area of <num>
<num> acres <num>
<num> ha and has been under the control of the archaeological survey of india since <year>
it is also linked with viraiyapattinam or virampattinam meaning port of virai a village next to arikamedu
virai according to sangam literature was well known as a port and also for its salt pans during the velir dynasty
arikamedu @-@ virampatnam together find mention as poduke a major port in the periplus of the erythraean sea in the first century ce and as poduke emporion in ptolemy 's geographia of mid first century ce
poduke is a roman name and is also said to be a corrupted version of the tamil name potikai meaning a meeting place also known for the local poduvar clan
it informed the french east india company that villagers were extracting old bricks from the virampattinam
the earliest mention of the arikamedu archaeological site was by le gentil of france who the king of france had assigned to observe notable astronomical occurrences in the world
gentil after visiting arikamedu confirmed the earlier report of the consul of the indo @-@ french colony
in <year> when he visited the ruins at the site he found the people of the village collecting large ancient bricks exposed at the river bank
the villagers told him that they had retrieved the bricks from an old fort of the king the vira @-@ raguen
in <year> jouveau dubreuil an indologist also from france purchased gem stone antiquities from local children and also gathered some exposed on the site 's surface
in particular he found an intaglio carved with the picture of a man
as a numismatist he identified the intaglio as augustus caesar
he also found fine beads and gems
he concluded that these antiquities belonged to the roman empire
dubreuil informed the local governor of pondicherry about his find and called arikamedu a true roman city
he published a short note about his findings
in the early <num> service des travaux publics carried out random excavations
father fancheux and raymand surleau who were not qualified archaeologists carried out the excavations at arikamedu and sent a few antiquities to indian museums and also to the école française d 'extrême @-@ orient in hanoi
sir r
e
m
wheeler the director general of the archaeological survey of india in the <num> saw a few potsherds of arikamedu site displayed in the madras museum which he identified as arrentine ware an expensive ceramic made until <num> ce in arizzo italy
thereafter when he visited the pondicherry museum and saw more of the findings from the arikamedu site he was impressed and thought that he had found the links between the classical mediterranean and ancient india
soon thereafter in <year> the penultimate year of world war ii he mounted excavations in a scientific manner
he was looking for an archaeological site in india that could establish its cultural link a datum of the indian antiquities to the greco @-@ roman period and this quest led him to the arikamedu site
these excavations also involved indian archaeologists who were trained on the site
wheeler published his findings in <year>
he noted that for the local fishermen of the village the antiquities were strange — as they consisted of lamps glass items gemstones cutlery and crockery wine containers etc
he also observed that traders traveled from west coast and from ceylon kolchoi colchi and the ganges area to trade goods such as gems pearls and spices and silk
he carried out excavations carefully so that none of the antiquities were damaged
this was followed by investigations after the war from <year> – <year> by jean @-@ marie casal
his report of excavations was not as fully published as wheeler 's
his report was not well @-@ known in india as it was not written in english
however his important conclusion was that the site belonged to an early megalithic period as he had located megalithic burials marked by stones locally known in tamil as pandukal close to the site
the excavations led to antiquities of roman origin such as beads and gems amphorae wine making vats with remnants of wine a roman stamp big bricks recovered from an old wall arretine ware and so forth
from these antiquities wheeler concluded that the site was related to a period of trading with rome and that it was first established by emperor augustus
he also noted that this indo @-@ roman trade lasted for a period of about <num> years till <num> ce
wheeler also found the chinese celadon identified to belong to the song @-@ yuvan dynasty and chola coins from about the eleventh century but these were rejected as despoiling items or remnants left by brick @-@ robbers
items chinese blue @-@ and @-@ white ware were also recovered from the site
wheeler noted that rouletted ware found at the site designated as arikamedu type <num> in the scientific study under the arikamedu type <num> project mapping early historic networks in south asia and beyond was not of an indian origin but was from the mediterranean region
a ceramic sherd arikamedu type <num> has also been investigated for its style and spatial distribution
after a gap of several decades in the early <num> vimala begley studied the ceramics find of the site and proposed a preliminary version of the chronology of the occupation of the site
at the same time she started researching on the beads organized a proper sequential display of the artifacts of the site at the pondicherry museum and brought out an information brochure
begley obtained approvals to carry out excavations at the site in collaboration with the university of pennsylvania and the university of madras she and k
v
raman were the directors of operation from <year> to <year>
steven sidebothom of the university of delaware who had back ground knowledge of roman egypt was in charge of the trenching at the site
further excavations were done during six working seasons from <year> to <year> which led to a contradictory view that the brick structures and the wells investigated by wheeler were of poor quality as they were founded on poor sandy foundations
the wood work was also noted to be of poor quality and the houses had no waterproofing
the excavations also lead to a view that arikamedu 's roman trading link was more of an inference
the excavations have now established that the trading with rome extended to a period beyond that assessed by wheeler that trading continued from the second century bce to the seventh or eighth century ce
the extensive findings of glass and stone beads at the site provided begley the link to arikamedu 's history
she identified the beads as indo @-@ pacific beads crafted at arikamedu
based on the antiquities and structural features from the excavations begley and raman established a revised sequence of six major periods of occupation of the site
finds of new variety of roman amphorae ware also facilitated revision of the dates of occupancy
they have also inferred that the site has been in continuous occupation since at least <num> or <num> century bce to much more recent times
northern sector of the mound is nearer to the sea coast while the southern sector is farther away from the coast
the ceramic find of crockery and cooking vessels found in the northern sector were indicative of mass feeding of sailors and traders who camped there
wine stored in amphorae was the principal item imported from the western countries during the later part of the <num> century bce
according to wheeler the finds from the northern and southern part of the mound belong to the period from later part of 1st century bce to 1st and <num> centuries ce
identified structures include a brick and lime mortar plaster structure of oblong shape <num> metres <num> ft in length with a divide wall used as a storehouse in the southern part two walled enclosures with ponds and drainage systems in the northern part of the mound that could indicate of dyeing operations that used vats to dye muslin for export pottery both local and mediterranean such as amphorae and arrentine ware that belonged to the terra sigillata stamped pottery of 1st century bce which went out of use by <num> ce pink amphorae jars used to store wine or oil with two handles and a yellow slip found in all layers of excavations smaller objects include a wheel @-@ turned blackware ceramic a few terracotta figurines shell beads gems gold terracotta iron nails copper percussion beater red fragment of a roman lamp shade an engraved emblem of emperor augustus an ivory handle and a wooden toy boat
based on these antiquities wheeler concluded that the arikamedu was a greek yavana trading station
however recent excavations by begley have altered this assessment
the buildings in the northern part of the mound indicative urbanization with people of different ethnic groups — indian and non @-@ indian — but it has not been possible to date them in view of the limited depth of excavations
during this conference the government of pondicherry also decided to propose the site for status as a world heritage site of unesco
the archaeological survey of india also proposed the site for unesco cultural heritage site status under the title silk road sites in india
ingrid was the ninth named storm and second hurricane of the <year> atlantic hurricane season
it formed on september <num> in the gulf of mexico from a broad disturbance that also spawned manuel in the eastern pacific
after initially moving westward toward veracruz ingrid turned northeastward away from the coast
favorable conditions allowed it to attain hurricane status on september <num> and the next day ingrid attained peak winds of <num> km h <num> mph
subsequently increased wind shear weakened the convection as the storm turned more to the northwest and west
on september <num> ingrid made landfall just south of la pesca tamaulipas in northeastern mexico as a strong tropical storm and dissipated the next day
the combined impacts of hurricanes ingrid and manuel affected two @-@ thirds of mexico killing <num> people and causing <num> billion pesos mxn <num>
<num> billion usd in damage
most of the effects were due to manuel though ingrid was directly responsible for at least <num> deaths and <num> billion pesos mxn <num>
<num> billion usd in damage
the two storms produced <num> billion <num> <num>
<num> trillion cu ft of water the equivalent of filling every dam in mexico
rainfall from the storm peaked at <num> mm <num>
<num> in in tuxpan veracruz
the rains caused widespread flooding damaging at least <num> @,@ <num> houses and hundreds of roads and bridges
in tamaulipas where the storm made landfall the rainfall damaged crops and flooded rivers
the effects of the storm spread into southern texas causing high tides and some flooding
after the storm the mexican government declared several municipalities as states of emergency
relief agencies distributed food and aid to the hardest hit areas although in tamaulipas residents had to rely on assistance from the local gulf cartel
the names ingrid and manuel were both later retired due to their impacts
on september <num> an area of convection or thunderstorms developed along the northern portion of the wave but was eventually absorbed into tropical storm gabrielle north of puerto rico
the wave continued westward through the caribbean sea into a large area of cyclonic flow at the surface which extended across central america into the eastern pacific
around september <num> the broad system developed two areas of disturbed weather – one in the eastern pacific would become hurricane manuel and the other developing over the northwestern caribbean
the latter system slowly organized developing a low pressure area on september <num>
subsequently the system moved over the yucatán peninsula
although land interaction prevented immediate development conditions favored further development in the bay of campeche
early on september <num> the low emerged into the bay and at <year> utc the national hurricane center nhc assessed that tropical depression ten developed about <num> km <num> mi east @-@ northeast of veracruz
this was confirmed by a hurricane hunters flight indicating the presence of a closed low @-@ level circulation
on september <num> convection and organization increased and the depression strengthened into tropical storm ingrid while weak steering currents resulted in little movement of the cyclone
partially due to the presence of nearby hurricane manuel in the eastern pacific basin on the other side of mexico significant wind shear existed in the vicinity of ingrid
nonetheless strong convection and intermittent development of an eye allowed for strengthening of the storm on september <num>
ingrid strengthened into a hurricane – the second of the season – that afternoon
around that time the hurricane turned sharply northeastward due to a trough over eastern mexico and a ridge over the southeastern united states
additional strengthening took place thereafter and ingrid reached a peak intensity of <num> km h <num> mph early on september <num> while starting to move northward and begin a northwest turn towards the mexican coastline
afterward ingrid reached peak winds shear increased and began to weaken the hurricane as it approached the mexican coast
the center became displaced to the edge of the convection and nhc forecaster daniel brown noted that ingrid did not resemble a classic hurricane in satellite pictures
at around <num> utc on september <num> ingrid made landfall just south of la pesca tamaulipas in northeastern mexico after having weakened into a strong tropical storm with <num> km h <num> mph winds
near landfall the hurricane hunters reported flight @-@ level winds of <num> km h <num> mph which after adjusting to surface winds confirmed the weakening
the storm moved ashore less than <num> hours after tropical storm manuel struck the pacific coast of mexico on michoacán making it the first time since <year> that tropical cyclones struck both coasts of the country within one day
ingrid rapidly weakened into a tropical depression over land and although convection temporarily reorganized the circulation dissipated on september <num>
upon the development of ingrid into a tropical cyclone at <num> utc on september <num> the government of mexico issued a tropical storm warning from coatzacoalcos to nautla veracruz
at <year> utc on september <num> the tropical storm warning was extended northward to cabo rojo veracruz with a tropical storm watch northward to la pesca tamaulipas
later a hurricane warning was issued between cabo rojo to la pesca with a tropical storm watch to bahia algodones tamaulipas
pemex the oil company operated by the mexican government evacuated workers from three platforms in the gulf of mexico due to the storm
in tamaulipas classes were canceled in <num> municipalities and all classes were temporarily canceled throughout veracruz
the threat of the storm caused events for mexican independence day to be canceled
after a restriction on the news in <year> due to the local drug war members of a citizen alert system in tamaulipas used twitter to notify about flooding missing people and the need for assistance
early in its duration ingrid produced tropical storm force winds along the coast of veracruz
while making landfall it also brought tropical storm force winds along the northeastern mexican coast
sustained winds at la pesca peaked at <num> km h <num> mph with gusts to <num> km h <num> mph
the nhc remarked that ingrid likely caused above normal tides in northeastern mexico but there was no data to back up the statement
interacting with hurricane manual on the pacific coast and the broad cyclonic flow ingrid dropped heavy rainfall across eastern mexico primarily in tabasco veracruz and tamaulipas states
in tuxpan veracruz rainfall totaled <num> mm <num>
<num> in over <num> days while at the presa vicente guerrero dam in tamaulipas precipitation reached <num> mm <num>
<num> in
surface runoff from the storm spread to the pacific coast of mexico producing flooding in guerrero in combination with manuel
the impacts from both storms produced <num> billion <num> <num>
<num> trillion cu ft of water the equivalent of filling every dam in the country
the combined effects of hurricanes ingrid and manuel affected about two @-@ thirds of mexico
the rains from ingrid caused flooding and landslides across mexico causing many rivers to rise and isolating towns
in veracruz alone the rains flooded <num> rivers which damaged <num> roads and <num> bridges including two destroyed bridges
about <num> @,@ <num> houses were damaged to some degree
heavy rainfall forced <num> @,@ <num> people to evacuate their homes <num> @,@ <num> of whom went to emergency shelters some forced to leave by the mexican army in high risk areas
evacuees who did not reside in shelters generally went to the houses of friends and family
also in veracruz flooding killed about <num> @,@ <num> livestock
along the coast of tamaulipas damage occurred from soto la marina to la pesca
the pánuco river in tamaulipas rose above its banks flooding two poor towns along its path and damaging adjacent roads
also in the state the storm damaged local sorghum fields
two people in the state required rescue after their truck was swept away by a river
throughout mexico ingrid killed <num> people mostly due to flooding and mudslides
the two storms collectively killed at least <num> people and caused <num> billion pesos mxn <num>
<num> billion usd
manuel was responsible for majority of the overall effects although ingrid still left an estimated <num> billion pesos mxn <num>
<num> billion usd in estimated economic losses according to aon benfield insured damages totaled <num> billion pesos mxn <num> million usd
a total of six fatalities occurred in the states of hidalgo and puebla
three of which were caused after a vehicle was swept off a road while three other people died after their home was buried by a mudslide another death occurred in hidalgo after a house collapsed on a woman in the town of tepehuacán de guerrero
twelve people died after a landslide smashed a bus in altotonga veracruz and three people died in tamaulipas
the fringes of the storm extended into southern texas where winds gusted to tropical storm force and rainfall was around <num> – <num> mm <num>
<num> – <num>
<num> in
thunderstorms and high tides affected the coastline with tides reaching <num>
<num> m <num>
<num> ft above normal causing beaches to close due to flooding
the nation 's health ministry sent medical crews across the country to affected areas in an effort to prevent the spread of disease the agency also suggested residents boil their water
officials opened shelters in tamaulipas for residents whose houses were damaged housing about <num> @,@ <num> people in the weeks following the storm
the mexican food bank sent about <num> tons of food to the hardest @-@ hit parts of the country in guerrero veracruz and sinaloa
in addition the mexican red cross delivered <num> tons of food to veracruz alone
volunteers delivered about <num> blankets and various cleaning supplies to the town of pánuco
following the storms the national civil protection coordination received the authority to prevent housing construction in areas at risk for mudslides and flooding the law had passed in <year> but initially lacked the authority to enforce it
some residents in tamaulipas complained at the slow pace of receiving aid
in response the gulf cartel brought relief items to aldama with one columnist for el universal suggesting that this was to gain favor with local residents
because of the severe damage caused by the storm in mexico the name ingrid was later retired by the world meteorological organization and will never again be used for a north atlantic hurricane
it was replaced with imelda for the <year> atlantic hurricane season
the name manuel was also retired from the pacific naming list and was replaced with mario
the seventh named storm and fourth typhoon of the season imbudo formed on july <num> to the east of the philippines
the storm moved generally west @-@ northward for much of its duration due to a ridge to the north
favorable conditions allowed imbudo to intensify gradually at first before undergoing rapid deepening on july <num>

in <year> the world meteorological organization retired the name imbudo and replaced it with molave
the pagasa name harurot was replaced with hanna for the <year> season
forming as a tropical depression on august <num> the storm supported strong thunderstorm activity and quickly organized
it became a tropical storm over the following day and subsequently underwent rapid deepening to attain hurricane status
later that afternoon felicia featured a well @-@ defined eye as its winds sharply rose to major hurricane @-@ force on the saffir – simpson scale
further strengthening ensued and felicia peaked in intensity as a category <num> hurricane with sustained winds of <num> mph <num> km h and a barometric pressure of <num> mbar hpa <num>
<num> inhg
after reaching this strength unfavorable conditions such as wind shear began to impact the storm while it took on a northwestward path
henceforth felicia slowly weakened for several days by august <num> it had been downgraded to a category <num> hurricane once again becoming a tropical storm the next day
it retraced westward towards hawaii on august <num> all the while decreasing in organization
on august <num> felicia weakened to tropical depression status and soon degenerated into remnant low just prior to passing over the islands
after weakening into a remnant low felicia continued to approach the hawaiian islands and on august <num> the system produced copious amounts of rainfall across several islands
the highest total was recorded on oahu at <num>
<num> in <num> mm causing isolated mudslides and flooding
in maui the heavy rains helped to alleviate drought conditions and water shortages significantly increasing the total water across the island 's reservoirs
in addition river flooding resulted in the closure of one school and large swells produced by the storm resulted in several lifeguard rescues at island beaches
in all only minor impacts were caused by the remnants of felicia
a weak system the wave was barely identifiable as it tracked westward
by july <num> the wave entered the caribbean sea before crossing central america and entering the eastern pacific basin on july <num>
the system remained ill @-@ defined until august <num> at which time convection began to increase and the wave showed signs of organization
the storm gradually became better organized as it tracked generally towards the west
by august <num> the system became increasingly organized and around <num> <num> am pdt <year> utc the national hurricane center nhc designated the system as tropical depression eight @-@ e
convective banding features and poleward outflow were being enhanced by the nearby tropical storm enrique
the main steering component of the depression was an upper @-@ level low located to the north causing the depression to track generally west before turning northwest after the low weakened
by the early morning hours of august <num> the nhc upgraded tropical depression eight @-@ e to tropical storm felicia the seventh named storm of the season
located within an area of low wind shear and high sea surface temperatures averaging between <num> and <num> ° c <num> and <num> ° f the storm quickly developed with deep convection persisting around the center of circulation
these conditions were anticipated to persist for at least three days however there was an increased amount of uncertainty due to possible interaction with tropical storm enrique
several hours later the storm began to undergo rapid intensification following the formation of an eye
around <num> <num> pm pdt <num> utc felicia intensified into a hurricane
late on august <num> the intensity of felicia led to it taking a more northward turn in response to a mid- to upper @-@ level trough off the coast of the western united states
early the next morning the storm continued to intensify and attained category <num> status with winds of <num> mph <num> km h
maintaining a well @-@ defined eye felicia neared category <num> status and hours later the storm attained winds of <num> mph <num> km h and a pressure of <num> mbar hpa <num>
<num> inhg during the evening hours making it the strongest pacific storm east of the international date line since hurricane ioke in <year> and the strongest in the eastern pacific basin since hurricane daniel of <year>
around <num> <num> pm pdt <num> utc august <num> felicia reached its peak intensity with winds of <num> mph <num> km h and a minimum central pressure of <num> mbar hpa <num>
<num> inhg
after slightly weakening throughout the day on august <num> felicia leveled out with winds of <num> mph <num> km h and a <num> mi <num> km wide eye as the storm developed characteristics of an annular hurricane which would allow felicia to maintain a high intensity over marginally warm waters
early the next day the structure of the hurricane quickly deteriorated as convection became asymmetric and cloud tops warmed significantly
this marked a quick drop in intensity of the storm to a minimal category <num> hurricane
several hours later the mid @-@ level circulation began to separate from the low @-@ level circulation and the overall size of the storm decreased
by this time the storm began to take a long @-@ anticipated westward turn towards hawaii
after briefly re @-@ intensifying on august <num> felicia weakened to a category <num> hurricane early on august <num>
around <num> <num> am hst <num> utc the central pacific hurricane center cphc took over responsibility of issuing advisories as felicia crossed longitude <num> ° w
by august <num> increasing wind shear further weakened the storm with felicia being downgraded to a tropical storm early that day
the storm rapidly weakened throughout the day as convection gradually dissipated around the center due to the shear
by the late morning hours little convective activity remained around the low pressure center of felicia
a weak cyclone the storm continued to track towards hawaii with the only deep convection associated with it being displaced to the northeast of the center
the system slowly weakened before being downgraded to a tropical depression on august <num> as no areas of tropical storm @-@ force winds were found by hurricane hunters
several hours after being downgraded the cphc issued its final advisory on felicia as it degenerated into a remnant low near the hawaiian islands
the system dissipated shortly thereafter
residents were advised to ensure that their disaster kits were fully stocked and ready
governor linda lingle made a speech to the state of hawaii the same day
she emphasized that the storm was not an imminent threat but that residents should be ready and should know where the nearest emergency shelter is
since forecasters expected the storm to weaken before it reached the islands only minor effects — mainly rainfall — were expected
hawaii county mayor billy kenoi was also briefed on the approaching storm and he advised the county to be prepared
stores reported an influx of shoppers and posted anniversary sales
blue tarps for roofs were being sold at <num> apiece
the american red cross also reported that sales of the water bob a water container that can be attached to a bathtub and hold roughly <num> gallons of water increased significantly
on august <num> the red cross stated that it was deploying a disaster recovery team led by the director of the agency to the islands of hawaii
on august <num> five hurricane hunter planes were dispatched to hickam air force base to fly missions into the storm
later that day the central pacific hurricane center issued tropical storm watches for the island of hawaii maui kahoolawe lanai and molokai
on august <num> the watch was expanded to include oahu
the watches for the big island were later cancelled as the forecast track appeared to drift further north toward maui county and oahu
the red cross opened shelters throughout the islands on august <num>
twelve were on the big island seven were on maui two on molokai and one on lanai
the honolulu international airport ensured that eight generators were ready for use in case felicia caused a power outage at the airport

in wailua beach there was one lifeguard rescue that resulted in the swimmer being sent to a local hospital
three other people were swept away at the mouth of the wailua river all of whom were quickly rescued

it was recorded during the sessions that would in <year> be released on the basement tapes but was not included on that album
these sessions took place in three phases throughout the year at a trio of houses and santa @-@ fe was likely put on tape in the second of these at a home of some of the band members known as big pink
the composition which has been characterized as a nonsense song was copyrighted in <year> with lyrics that differ noticeably from those on the recording itself
in the decades following this collaboration the over <num> tracks recorded at these sessions were at different stages obtained by collectors and released on bootlegs
the first batch of these leaked to the public beginning in the late <num> the second in <year> the third which included santa @-@ fe in the early <num> and a fourth batch of basement tape tracks became public in <year>
the song was released officially on the columbia album the bootleg series volumes <num> – <num> rare unreleased <year> – <year>
it has been subject to mixed opinions by critics and biographers with some praising it for its expressiveness and others regarding it unmemorable while criticizing its inclusion on the bootleg series at the expense of more worthy candidates
in july <year> dylan suffered a motorcycle accident and spent several months recuperating at his house in byrdcliffe near woodstock new york
by spring <year> all of the members of the hawks except helm had joined dylan in the woodstock area with danko manuel and hudson living in nearby west saugerties in a house nicknamed big pink
dylan and the four hawks began recording informal music sessions first at dylan 's house in what was known as the red room followed by the basement of big pink
earlier on they recorded mostly covers and traditional music but later moved onto original material written largely by dylan
in total over <num> songs and alternate takes were put on tape
helm returned to the group in october <year> and performed on some final woodstock @-@ area collaborations between dylan and the hawks these ones at a different house that some group members had moved to
in the fall of that year the hawks who soon renamed themselves the band continued writing and rehearsing songs for their debut album music from big pink
dylan biographer sid griffin has noted that because no written records were kept of these <year> recording sessions the world will have to live with the fact that it will never know exactly which basement tapes tune was recorded when and where
nonetheless using clues such as the sound quality of different batches of songs and where they appear on the original reels of tapes attempts have been made to place the songs into a rough chronology and guess the locations at which they were likely recorded
biographer clinton heylin places santa @-@ fe in the summer of <year> at big pink
the liner notes of the bootleg series volumes <num> – <num> date it in the fall of that year
griffin lists it among the probable big pink recordings and in a group of songs from around july but concedes it is also unlikely but possible it came from the red room
artists including peter paul and mary manfred mann and the byrds eventually did
dylan 's demo tapes were soon heard by music journalists including rolling stone 's jann wenner who wrote a front @-@ page story in that magazine entitled dylan 's basement tape should be released
this made the general public hungry to hear the music and in july <year> a bootleg called great white wonder which included some of the big pink songs came out
other basement tape bootlegs followed
in <year> the columbia album the basement tapes was compiled mainly by robertson and engineer rob fraboni
robertson and fraboni put thirty @-@ five of the songs onto composite reels of tape and heylin believes these represented a short list of candidates for the album
santa @-@ fe was included on these composite reels but was not ultimately chosen for the album
the basement tapes included sixteen dylan songs recorded at big pink in <year> as well as eight band demos from various times and locations between <year> and <year>
one dylan song on the album goin to acapulco had not appeared on his <year> fourteen @-@ song acetate or on bootlegs and this alerted the world to the possibility that there might be more basement tape songs in existence
in <year> at least twenty @-@ five previously unknown <year> songs by dylan and the band passed into collectors hands by way of a former roadie of the band 's
in the early <num> a third batch of songs these ones from garth hudson 's archives came to light around the time columbia was preparing the bootleg series volumes <num> – <num> santa @-@ fe comes from this group
in his liner notes for the bootleg series volumes <num> – <num> john bauldie commented on these second and third stages in which groups of big pink songs had come to light despite the
emergence in <year> in collectors circles of a further couple of hours of basement tapes it seems as though there 's a good deal left unheard
santa @-@ fe is just one example of a batch of previously unsuspected basement tracks
by <year> the santa @-@ fe batch of songs had been obtained by bootleggers and almost all known dylan basement tape songs were assembled onto the <num> @-@ cd bootleg the genuine basement tapes
sante @-@ fe was also included on the <year> compilations the basement tapes raw and the bootleg series vol
<num> the basement tapes complete the latter album officially released a fourth batch of previously uncirculating basement tape songs
however griffin argues that helm did not arrive in woodstock until after the song is believed to have been recorded
furthermore the drumming sounds to griffin more like manuel 's style
heylin and biographer greil marcus similarly do not include santa @-@ fe among the songs they believe were recorded after helm 's arrival
griffin also argues that no organ is audible on the track and proposes the following musician line @-@ up as being more likely dylan acoustic guitar and vocals robertson electric guitar hudson piano danko bass manuel drums
researcher tim dunn indicates that in the original <year> copyright the song was registered as santa @-@ fe with a hyphen but that some later documents relating to the renewal of the copyright omit the hyphen
the liner notes of the bootleg series volumes <num> – <num> print the title as santa @-@ fe while dylan 's official website bobdylan
com spells it without the hyphen but with an accent on the e santa fé
heylin has noted that as is the case with a number of other of basement tape tracks dylan 's copyrighted published santa @-@ fe lyrics differ from what can be heard on the song
heylin speculates that the dramatic reworking in the later version arose from dylan 's <year> musing in malibu where dylan had moved to and that new lines like build a geodesic dome and sail away and my shrimp boat 's in the bay sound like the work of someone sitting on the dock of the bay not up on meads mountain in woodstock
heylin also notes that the website maintained by olof björner words fill my head contains a transcription of the song as dylan performed it
the <year> copyrighted lyrics are printed on bobdylan
com
in his notes for the bootleg series volumes <num> – <num> bauldie describes the song as a typical combination of nonsense and fun just for the hell of it really
author oliver trager likewise describes it as a nonsense song
heylin writes that the lyrics revolve around dear dear dear dear santa fe — intended to be both a woman 's name and the town in new mexico
after five verses of rolling said words around he moves on
allmusic critic thomas ward calls it one of the great good @-@ time songs in dylan 's canon
ward comments that dylan sings it as if he is having the time of his life adding that rarely has he sung with such expressiveness
anthony varesi author of the bob dylan albums similarly praises the song 's breadth of feeling and unparalleled expressiveness noting that it appears dylan simply improvised the song on the spot and the passion within him allows the song to flow forth naturally
biographer john nagowski has described the song as delightful while a new york times review rates it one of the highlights of volume <num> of the bootleg series volumes <num> – <num> commenting that it is one of only a couple of mid @-@ <num> songs on the compilation that live up to their vintage
griffin describes it as catchy but slight and a slight if charming little ditty but criticizes the decision to include it on the bootleg series volumes <num> – <num> rather than the masterpiece composition sign on the cross
heylin concurs characterizing santa @-@ fe in <year> as a pleasant enough throwaway but suggesting that sign on the cross or another <year> composition i 'm not there would have been much better choices i 'm not there was eventually released in <year> on the i 'm not there soundtrack and both it and sign on the cross were included on the basement tapes raw and the basement tapes complete in <year>
by <year> heylin 's opinion had changed little and he writes that of all the missing basement @-@ tape originals that appear on that three @-@ cd set santa fe hardly represented an a @-@ list candidate
just another discarded ditty it relies on the usual wordplay and slurred diction to obscure any pretense to a deeper meaning
marcus dismisses it as no more than a riff while a review in stereophile magazine calls it the most lightweight tune on all three cds with indecipherable lyrics
author peter james referring to dylan and the band 's woodstock output writes that many great songs were written and recorded in big pink 's basement in <year> unfortunately sante @-@ fe is not one of them
he goes on to describe the song 's inclusion on the bootleg series volumes <num> – <num> as little more than a joke
fishman played more than sixty songs from dylan and the band 's basement tape sessions over three nights of which selected tracks were included on the cd and an accompanying dvd
santa @-@ fe has also been covered by steve gibbons
on november <num> <year> at the beacon theatre in new york city j mascis and the million dollar bashers performed the song at a special concert featuring numerous music artists celebrating the release of todd haynes 's film i 'm not there
thomas ward notes that dylan himself has never played the song live
it was written by lee eisenberg and gene stupnitsky and directed by dennie gordon
