du fu wade–giles tu fu chinese 杜 712–770 was a prominent chinese poet of the tang dynasty along with li bai li po he is frequently called the greatest of the chinese poets his greatest ambition was to serve his country as a successful civil servant but he proved unable to make the necessary accommodations his life like the whole country was devastated by the an lushan rebellion of 755 and his last 15 years were a time of almost constant unrest
although initially he was little-known to other writers his works came to be hugely influential in both chinese and japanese literary culture of his poetic writing nearly fifteen hundred poems have been preserved over the ages he has been called the poet-historian and the poet-sage by chinese critics while the range of his work has allowed him to be introduced to western readers as the chinese virgil horace ovid shakespeare milton burns wordsworth béranger hugo or baudelaire
traditional chinese literary criticism emphasized the life of the author when interpreting a work a practice which burton watson attributes to the close links that traditional chinese thought posits between art and morality since many of du fu's poems feature morality and history this practice is particularly important another reason identified by the chinese historian william hung is that chinese poems are typically concise omitting context that might be relevant but which an informed contemporary could be assumed to know for modern western readers the less accurately we know the time the place and the circumstances in the background the more liable we are to imagine it incorrectly and the result will be that we either misunderstand the poem or fail to understand it altogether stephen owen suggests a third factor particular to du fu arguing that the variety of the poet's work required consideration of his whole life rather than the reductive categorizations used for more limited poets
most of what is known of du fu's life comes from his poems his paternal grandfather was du shenyan a noted politician and poet during the reign of empress wu du fu was born in 712 the exact birthplace is unknown except that it was near luoyang henan province gong county is a favourite candidate in later life he considered himself to belong to the capital city of chang 'an ancestral hometown of the du family
du fu's mother died shortly after he was born and he was partially raised by his aunt he had an elder brother who died young he also had three half brothers and one half sister to whom he frequently refers in his poems although he never mentions his stepmother
the son of a minor scholar-official his youth was spent on the standard education of a future civil servant study and memorisation of the confucian classics of philosophy history and poetry he later claimed to have produced creditable poems by his early teens but these have been lost
in the early 730s he travelled in the jiangsu zhejiang area his earliest surviving poem describing a poetry contest is thought to date from the end of this period around 735 in that year he took the civil service exam likely in chang 'an he failed to his surprise and that of centuries of later critics hung concludes that he probably failed because his prose style at the time was too dense and obscure while chou suggests his failure to cultivate connections in the capital may have been to blame after this failure he went back to traveling this time around shandong and hebei
his father died around 740 du fu would have been allowed to enter the civil service because of his father's rank but he is thought to have given up the privilege in favour of one of his half brothers he spent the next four years living in the luoyang area fulfilling his duties in domestic affairs
in the autumn of 744 he met li bai li po for the first time and the two poets formed a friendship david young describes this as the most significant formative element in du fu's artistic development because it gave him a living example of the reclusive poet-scholar life to which he was attracted after his failure in the civil service exam the relationship was somewhat one-sided however du fu was by some years the younger while li bai was already a poetic star we have twelve poems to or about li bai from the younger poet but only one in the other direction they met again only once in 745
in 746 he moved to the capital in an attempt to resurrect his official career he took the civil service exam a second time during the following year but all the candidates were failed by the prime minister apparently in order to prevent the emergence of possible rivals he never again attempted the examinations instead petitioning the emperor directly in 751 754 and probably again in 755 he married around 752 and by 757 the couple had had five children — three sons and two daughters — but one of the sons died in infancy in 755 from 754 he began to have lung problems probably asthma the first of a series of ailments which dogged him for the rest of his life it was in that year that du fu was forced to move his family due to the turmoil of a famine brought about by massive floods in the region
in 755 he received an appointment as registrar of the right commandant's office of the crown prince's palace although this was a minor post in normal times it would have been at least the start of an official career even before he had begun work however the position was swept away by events
the an lushan rebellion began in december 755 and was not completely suppressed for almost eight years it caused enormous disruption to chinese society the census of 754 recorded 52.9 million people but ten years later the census counted just 16.9 million the remainder having been displaced or killed during this time du fu led a largely itinerant life unsettled by wars associated famines and imperial displeasure this period of unhappiness was the making of du fu as a poet even shan chou has written that what he saw around him — the lives of his family neighbors and strangers–what he heard and what he hoped for or feared from the progress of various campaigns — these became the enduring themes of his poetry even when he learned of the death of his youngest child he turned to the suffering of others in his poetry instead of dwelling upon his own misfortunes du fu wrote
brooding on what i have lived through if even i know such suffering the common man must surely be rattled by the winds
in 756 emperor xuanzong was forced to flee the capital and abdicate du fu who had been away from the city took his family to a place of safety and attempted to join the court of the new emperor suzong but he was captured by the rebels and taken to chang 'an in the autumn his youngest son du zongwu baby bear was born around this time du fu is thought to have contracted malaria
he escaped from chang 'an the following year and was appointed reminder when he rejoined the court in may 757 this post gave access to the emperor but was largely ceremonial du fu's conscientiousness compelled him to try to make use of it he caused trouble for himself by protesting the removal of his friend and patron fang guan on a petty charge he was arrested but was pardoned in june he was granted leave to visit his family in september but he soon rejoined the court and on december 8 757 he returned to chang 'an with the emperor following its recapture by government forces however his advice continued to be unappreciated and in the summer of 758 he was demoted to a post as commissioner of education in huazhou the position was not to his taste in one poem he wrote
i am about to scream madly in the office especially when they bring more papers to pile higher on my desk
he moved on in the summer of 759 this has traditionally been ascribed to famine but hung believes that frustration is a more likely reason he next spent around six weeks in qinzhou now tianshui gansu province where he wrote more than sixty poems
in december 759 he briefly stayed in tonggu modern gansu he departed on december 24 for chengdu sichuan province where he was hosted by local prefect and fellow poet pei di du subsequently based himself in sichuan for most of the next five years by the autumn of that year he was in financial trouble and sent poems begging help to various acquaintances he was relieved by yan wu a friend and former colleague who was appointed governor general at chengdu despite his financial problems this was one of the happiest and most peaceful periods of his life many of du's poems from this period are peaceful depictions of his life at thatched hut in 762 he left the city to escape a rebellion but he returned in summer 764 when he was appointed an advisor to yan who was involved in campaigns against the tibetan empire
luoyang the region of his birthplace was recovered by government forces in the winter of 762 and in the spring of 765 du fu and his family sailed down the yangtze apparently with the intention of making their way there they traveled slowly held up by his ill-health by this time he was suffering from poor eyesight deafness and general old age in addition to his previous ailments they stayed in kuizhou in what is now baidicheng chongqing at the entrance to the three gorges for almost two years from late spring 766 this period was du fu's last great poetic flowering and here he wrote 400 poems in his dense late style in autumn 766 bo maolin became governor of the region he supported du fu financially and employed him as his unofficial secretary
in march 768 he began his journey again and got as far as hunan province where he died in tanzhou now changsha in november or december 770 in his 58th year he was survived by his wife and two sons who remained in the area for some years at least his last known descendant is a grandson who requested a grave inscription for the poet from yuan zhen in 813
hung summarises his life by concluding that he appeared to be a filial son an affectionate father a generous brother a faithful husband a loyal friend a dutiful official and a patriotic subject
below is an example of one of du fu's later works to my retired friend wei chinese  like many other poems in the tang it featured the theme of a long parting between friends which was often due to officials being frequently transferred to the provinces
criticism of du fu's works has focused on his strong sense of history his moral engagement and his technical excellence
since the song dynasty critics have called du fu the poet historian 史 shī sh the most directly historical of his poems are those commenting on military tactics or the successes and failures of the government or the poems of advice which he wrote to the emperor indirectly he wrote about the effect of the times in which he lived on himself and on the ordinary people of china as watson notes this is information of a kind seldom found in the officially compiled histories of the era
du fu's political comments are based on emotion rather than calculation his prescriptions have been paraphrased as let us all be less selfish let us all do what we are supposed to do since his views were impossible to disagree with his forcefully expressed truisms enabled his installation as the central figure of chinese poetic history
a second favourite epithet of chinese critics is that of poet sage  shī shèng a counterpart to the philosophical sage confucius one of the earliest surviving works the song of the wagons from around 750 gives voice to the sufferings of a conscript soldier in the imperial army and a clear-sighted consciousness of suffering these concerns are continuously articulated in poems on the lives of both soldiers and civilians produced by du fu throughout his life
although du fu's frequent references to his own difficulties can give the impression of an all-consuming solipsism hawkes argues that his famous compassion in fact includes himself viewed quite objectively and almost as an afterthought he therefore lends grandeur to the wider picture by comparing it to his own slightly comical triviality
du fu's compassion for himself and for others was part of his general broadening of the scope of poetry he devoted many works to topics which had previously been considered unsuitable for poetic treatment zhang jie wrote that for du fu everything in this world is poetry du wrote extensively on subjects such as domestic life calligraphy paintings animals and other poems
du fu's work is notable above all for its range chinese critics traditionally used the term 集大 jídàchéng- complete symphony a reference to mencius'description of confucius yuan zhen was the first to note the breadth of du fu's achievement writing in 813 that his predecessor united in his work traits which previous men had displayed only singly he mastered all the forms of chinese poetry chou says that in every form he either made outstanding advances or contributed outstanding examples furthermore his poems use a wide range of registers from the direct and colloquial to the allusive and self-consciously literary this variety is manifested even within individual works owen identifies the rapid stylistic and thematic shifts in poems which enable the poet to represent different facets of a situation while chou uses the term juxtaposition as the major analytical tool in her work du fu is noted for having written more on poetics and painting than any other writer of his time he wrote eighteen poems on painting alone more than any other tang poet du fu's seemingly negative commentary on the prized horse paintings of han gan ignited a controversy that has persisted to the present day
the tenor of his work changed as he developed his style and adapted to his surroundings chameleon-like according to watson his earliest works are in a relatively derivative courtly style but he came into his own in the years of the rebellion owen comments on the grim simplicity of the qinzhou poems which mirrors the desert landscape the works from his chengdu period are light often finely observed while the poems from the late kuizhou period have a density and power of vision
although he wrote in all poetic forms du fu is best known for his lshi a type of poem with strict constraints on form and content for example
about two thirds of du fu's 1500 extant works are in this form and he is generally considered to be its leading exponent his best lshi use the parallelisms required by the form to add expressive content rather than as mere technical restrictions hawkes comments that it is amazing that tu fu is able to use so immensely stylized a form in so natural a manner
according to the encyclopædia britannica du fu's writings are considered by many literary critics to be among the greatest of all time and it states his dense compressed language makes use of all the connotative overtones of a phrase and of all the intonational potentials of the individual word qualities that no translation can ever reveal
in his lifetime and immediately following his death du fu was not greatly appreciated in part this can be attributed to his stylistic and formal innovations some of which are still considered extremely daring and bizarre by chinese critics there are few contemporary references to him — only eleven poems from six writers — and these describe him in terms of affection but not as a paragon of poetic or moral ideals du fu is also poorly represented in contemporary anthologies of poetry
however as hung notes he is the only chinese poet whose influence grew with time and his works began to increase in popularity in the ninth century early positive comments came from bai juyi who praised the moral sentiments of some of du fu's works although he found these in only a small fraction of the poems and from han yu who wrote a piece defending du fu and li bai on aesthetic grounds from attacks made against them both these writers showed the influence of du fu in their own poetic work by the beginning of the 10th century wei zhuang constructed the first replica of his thatched cottage in sichuan
it was in the 11th century during the northern song era that du fu's reputation reached its peak in this period a comprehensive re-evaluation of earlier poets took place in which wang wei li bai and du fu came to be regarded as representing respectively the buddhist daoist and confucian strands of chinese culture at the same time the development of neo-confucianism ensured that du fu as its poetic exemplar occupied the paramount position su shi famously expressed this reasoning when he wrote that du fu was preeminent ... because ... through all his vicissitudes he never for the space of a meal forgot his sovereign his influence was helped by his ability to reconcile apparent opposites political conservatives were attracted by his loyalty to the established order while political radicals embraced his concern for the poor literary conservatives could look to his technical mastery while literary radicals were inspired by his innovations since the establishment of the people's republic of china du fu's loyalty to the state and concern for the poor have been interpreted as embryonic nationalism and socialism and he has been praised for his use of simple people's language
du fu's popularity grew to such an extent that it is as hard to measure his influence as that of shakespeare in england it was hard for any chinese poet not to be influenced by him while there was never another du fu individual poets followed in the traditions of specific aspects of his work bai juyi's concern for the poor lu you's patriotism and mei yaochen's reflections on the quotidian are a few examples more broadly du fu's work in transforming the lshi from mere word play into a vehicle for serious poetic utterance set the stage for every subsequent writer in the genre
in the 20th century he was the favourite poet of kenneth rexroth who has described him as the greatest non-epic non-dramatic poet who has survived in any language and commented that he has made me a better man as a moral agent and as a perceiving organism
du fu's poetry has made a profound impact on japanese literature especially on the literature from the muromachi period and on scholars and poets in the edo period including matsuo bashō the very greatest of all haiku poets even in modern japanese the term saint of poetry  shisei is mostly synonymous with du fu
until the 13th century the japanese preferred bai juyi above all poets and there were few references to du fu although his influence can be seen in some kanshi chinese poetry made by japanese poets anthologies such as bunka shūreishū in the 9th century the first notable japanese appreciator of du fu's poetry was kokan shiren 1278–1346 a rinzai zen patriarch and one of the most prominent authors of the literature of the five mountains he highly praised du fu and made a commentary on some poems of du fu from the perspective of a zen priest in vol 11 of saihokushū his student chūgan engetsu composed many kanshi which were clearly stated influenced by du fu in their prefaces chūgan's student gidō shūshin had close connection with the court and ashikaga shogunate and propagated du fu's poetry in the mundane world one day nijō yoshimoto the kampaku regent of the court and the highest authority of renga poetry asked gidō should i learn the poetry of du fu and li bai gidō dared to reply yes if you do have enough capability no if do not since then there had been many seminars on du fu's poetry both in zen temples and in the aristocratic society and as a result his poetry was often cited in japanese literature in the muromachi period e.g. taiheiki a historical epic in the late 14th century and some noh plays such as hyakuman bashō and shunkan
during the kan 'ei era of the edo period 1624–1643 shào chuán 傳 of the ming dynasty's collective commentary on du fu's lshi 杜集解 toritsu shikkai was imported into japan and it gained explosive popularity in confucian scholars and chōnin townspeople class the commentary established du fu's fame as the highest of all poets for instance hayashi shunsai a notable confucian scholar commented in vol 37 of gahō bunshū that zmi du fu was the very best poet in history and praised shào chuán's commentary for its simplicity and readability while he criticized old commentaries during the yuan dynasty were too unfathomable matsuo bashō the greatest haiku poet was also strongly influenced by du fu in oku no hosomichi his masterpiece he cites the first two lines of a spring view 春望 before a haiku as its introduction and also many of his other haiku have similar wording and themes it is said that when he died in osaka during a long travel a copy of du fu's poetry was found with him as one of a few precious items which he was able to carry around
a variety of styles have been used in efforts to translate du fu's work into english as burton watson remarks in the selected poems of du fu there are many different ways to approach the problems involved in translating du fu which is why we need as many different translations as possible p. xxii the translators have had to contend with bringing out the formal constraints of the original without sounding laboured to a western ear particularly when translating regulated verse or lshi and accommodating the complex allusions contained particularly in the later works hawkes writes that his poems do not as a rule come through very well in translation — p. ix one extreme on each issue is represented by kenneth rexroth's one hundred poems from the chinese his are free translations which seek to conceal the parallelisms through enjambement and expansion and contraction of the content his responses to the allusions are firstly to omit most of these poems from his selection and secondly to translate out the references in those works which he does select
other translators have placed much greater weight on trying to convey a sense of the poetic forms used by du fu vikram seth in three chinese poets uses english-style rhyme schemes whereas keith holyoak in facing the moon approximates the chinese rhyme scheme both use end-stopped lines and preserve some degree of parallelism in the selected poems of du fu burton watson follows the parallelisms quite strictly persuading the western reader to adapt to the poems rather than vice versa similarly he deals with the allusion of the later works by combining literal translation with extensive annotation
in 2015 stephen owen published translations with facing chinese texts of the complete poetry of du fu in six volumes with extensive scholarly apparatus which emphasized literalness

the ise-class battleships 戦 ise-gata senkan were a pair of dreadnought battleships built for the imperial japanese navy ijn during world war i. originally intended to be repeats of the preceding fusō class they were redesigned before construction began both ships carried supplies for the survivors of the great kantō earthquake in 1923 they were modernized in 1934–37 with improvements to their armour and machinery and a rebuilt superstructure in the pagoda mast style afterwards they played a minor role in the second sino-japanese war
despite the expensive reconstructions both vessels were considered obsolete by the eve of the pacific war and neither saw significant action in the early years of the war following the loss of most of the ijn's large aircraft carriers during the battle of midway in mid-1942 they were rebuilt with a flight deck replacing the rear pair of gun turrets to give them the ability to operate an air group of floatplanes a lack of aircraft and qualified pilots however meant that they never actually operated their aircraft in combat while awaiting their air group the sister ships were sometimes used to ferry troops and material to japanese bases they participated in the battle of cape engaño in late 1944 where they decoyed the american carrier fleet supporting the invasion of leyte away from the landing beaches afterwards both ships were transferred to southeast asia in early 1945 they participated in operation kita where they transported petrol and other strategic materials to japan the sisters were then reduced to reserve until they were sunk during american airstrikes in july after the war they were scrapped in 1946–47
the design of the fusō-class battleships was shaped both by the ongoing international naval arms race and a desire among japanese naval planners to maintain a fleet of capital ships powerful enough to defeat the united states navy in an encounter in japanese territorial waters the ijn's fleet of battleships had proven highly successful in 1905 the last year of the russo-japanese war which culminated in the destruction of the russian second and third pacific squadrons at the battle of tsushima
in the aftermath the japanese empire immediately turned its focus to the two remaining rivals for imperial dominance in the pacific ocean britain and the united states satō tetsutarō a japanese navy admiral and military theorist speculated that conflict would inevitably arise between japan and at least one of its two main rivals to that end he called for the japanese navy to maintain a fleet with at least 70 as many capital ships as the us navy this ratio satō theorized would enable the imperial japanese navy to defeat the us navy in one major battle in japanese waters in any eventual conflict accordingly the 1907 imperial defence policy called for the construction of a battle fleet of eight modern battleships 20,000 long tons 20,321 t each and eight modern armoured cruisers 18,000 long tons 18,289 t each this was the genesis of the eight-eight fleet program the development of a cohesive battle line of sixteen capital ships
the launch of hms dreadnought in 1906 by the royal navy raised the stakes and complicated japan's plans displacing 17,900 long tons 18,200 t and armed with ten 12-inch 30.5 cm guns dreadnought rendered all existing battleships obsolete by comparison the launch of the battlecruiser hms invincible the following year was a further setback for japan's quest for parity when the two new satsuma-class battleships and two tsukuba-class armoured cruisers launched by 1911 were outclassed by their british counterparts the eight-eight fleet program was restarted
the first battleships built for the renewed eight-eight fleet program were the two dreadnoughts of the kawachi class ordered in 1907 and laid down in 1908 in 1910 the navy put forward a request to the diet parliament to secure funding for the entirety of the program at once because of economic constraints only four battlecruisers and a single battleship of the fusō class were ultimately approved by the diet three more fusō-class ships yamashiro ise and hyūga were approved and all three were ordered in april 1913 while yamashiro was laid down later that year the ijn lacked the funding to proceed with the construction of ise and hyūga until the diet authorized additional funding for the ships in july 1914
the progress of fusō's construction while the ijn waited for the funding to be released and foreign developments caused the ijn to reassess the fusō-class design the distribution of the midships gun turrets was the most obvious flaw as they complicated the protection of the midships magazine and exposed more of the ship to the blast effects of the guns when they fired another issue was that japanese sailors had problems maintaining a high rate of fire with the 45.36-kilogram 100.0 lb shells used in the manually loaded 152-millimetre 6 in secondary guns used in the fusō class and earlier designs to resolve this issue the ijn designed a smaller 140-millimetre 5.5 in gun that offset its lighter shell weight with a higher rate of fire it also decided that the barbette armour of the earlier ships was too thin and wanted a modest increase in speed to partially counter the higher speeds of the latest foreign ships like the british queen elizabeth-class battleships and russian borodino-class battlecruisers for financial reasons more powerful engines could not be ordered so the new design was lengthened slightly and the boiler rooms enlarged to increase speed by 0.5 knots 0.93 km h 0.58 mph to 23 knots 43 km h 26 mph to save weight the forecastle deck was shortened so that the lower midships gun turret was lower than in the fusō class this reduced the crew's accommodations despite a significant increase in the crew's numbers and naval historian fukui shizuo believed that these ships had the worst habitability of any japanese capital ship the final design was designated a-92 by the ijn and differed enough from the a-64 design of the fusō class that it was considered a separate class
the ships had a length of 208.18 metres 683 ft 0 in overall a beam of 28.65 metres 94 ft 0 in and a draught of 8.93 metres 29 ft 4 in at deep load they displaced 36,500 long tons 37,100 t at deep load roughly 650 long tons 660 t more than the preceding class their crew consisted of 1,360 officers and enlisted men they had a metacentric height of 1.737 metres 5 ft 8.4 in at deep load
during the ships'modernization during the 1930s their forward superstructures were enlarged with multiple platforms added to their tripod foremasts both ships were also given torpedo bulges to improve their underwater protection and to compensate for the weight of the additional armour in addition their sterns were lengthened by 7.62 metres 25.0 ft these changes increased their overall length to 213.8 metres 701 ft their beam to 31.75 metres 104 ft 2 in and their draft to 9.45 metres 31 ft 0 in their displacement increased over 5,000 long tons 5,100 t to 42,001 long tons 42,675 t at deep load the crew now numbered 1,376 officers and enlisted men
the ise-class ships had two sets of direct-drive steam turbines each of which drove two propeller shafts with 3.429-metre 11 ft 3 in propellers the high-pressure turbines drove the wing shafts while the low-pressure turbines drove the inner shafts the turbines were designed to produce a total of 40,000 or 45,000 shaft horsepower 30,000 or 34,000 kw hyūga and ise respectively using steam provided by 24 kampon ro gō water-tube boilers at working pressures of 13–16.9 kg cm2 1,275–1,657 kpa 185–240 psi both ships comfortably exceeded their designed speed of 23 knots 43 km h 26 mph during their sea trials ise reached 23.6 knots 43.7 km h 27.2 mph from 56,498 shp 42,131 kw and hyūga exceeded that with 24 knots 44 km h 28 mph from 63,211 shp 47,136 kw each of the boilers consumed a mixture of coal and oil and the ships had a stowage capacity of 4,607 long tons 4,681 t of coal and 1,411 long tons 1,434 t of fuel oil which gave them a range of 9,680 nautical miles 17,930 km 11,140 mi at a speed of 14 knots 26 km h 16 mph ise and hyūga had three generators of 150 kilowatts 200 hp capacity and two 250-kilowatt 340 hp turbo generators at 225 volts
during their 1930s modernization the boilers on each ship were replaced by eight new kampon oil-fired boilers fitted into the former aft boiler room and the forward funnel was removed the turbines were replaced by four geared kampon turbines with a designed output of 80,000 shp 60,000 kw intended to increase their speed to 24.5 knots 45.4 km h 28.2 mph on her trials ise reached a top speed of 25.26 knots 46.78 km h 29.07 mph from 81,050 shp 60,440 kw the fuel storage of the ships was increased to a total of 5,113 long tons 5,195 t of fuel oil that gave them a range of 7,870 nautical miles 14,580 km 9,060 mi at a speed of 16 knots 30 km h 18 mph
the twelve 45-calibre 35.6 cm 14.0 in type 41 guns of the ise class were mounted in three pairs of twin-gun superfiring turrets numbered one through six from front to rear each turret weighed 655 long tons 666 t the hydraulically powered turrets had an elevation capability of − 5 20 degrees the guns had a rate of fire of 1.5–2 rounds per minute and could be loaded at any angle between -3 and 20 degrees in 1921 the elevation was increased to 30 degrees and then to 43 degrees during their mid-1930s modernization except for no. 6 turret as its supporting structure could not be lowered the recoil mechanism of the guns was also changed from a hydraulic to a pneumatic system which allowed for a faster firing cycle of the main guns
by world war ii the guns used type 91 armour-piercing capped shells each of these shells weighed 673.5 kilograms 1,485 lb and was fired at a muzzle velocity of 770–775 metres per second 2,530–2,540 ft s they had a maximum range of 25,000 metres 27,000 yd at 20 degrees of elevation and 35,450 meters 38,770 yd at 43 degrees after modernization also available was a 625-kilogram 1,378 lb high-explosive shell that had a muzzle velocity of 805 metres per second 2,640 ft s a special type 3 sanshikidan incendiary shrapnel shell was developed in the 1930s for anti-aircraft use
the ships'secondary armament consisted of twenty 50-calibre 14-centimetre type 3 eighteen of these were mounted in casemates in the forecastle and superstructure and the remaining pair were mounted on the deck above them and protected by gun shields they had a maximum elevation of 20 degrees which gave them ranges of 16,300 metres 17,800 yd each gun had a rate of fire of up to 10 rounds per minute anti-aircraft defence was provided by four 40-calibre 3rd year type 8-centimetre aa guns in single mounts the 7.62-centimetre 3 in high-angle guns had a maximum elevation of 75 degrees and had a rate of fire of 13 to 20 rounds per minute they fired a 6 kg 13 lb projectile with a muzzle velocity of 680 m s 2,200 ft s to a maximum height of 7,500 metres 24,600 ft the ships were also fitted with six submerged 53.3-centimetre 21.0 in torpedo tubes three on each broadside they carried twelve to eighteen 6th year type torpedoes which had a 200-kilogram 440 lb warhead they had three settings for range and speed 15,000 metres 16,000 yd at 26 knots 48 km h 30 mph 10,000 metres 11,000 yd at 32 knots 59 km h 37 mph or 7,000 metres 7,700 yd at 37 knots 69 km h 43 mph
in 1931–33 the aa guns were replaced with eight 40-caliber 12.7 cm 5.0 in type 89 dual-purpose guns fitted on both sides of the forward superstructures in four twin-gun mounts when firing at surface targets the guns had a range of 14,700 metres 16,100 yd they had a ceiling of 9,440 metres 30,970 ft at their maximum elevation of 90 degrees their maximum rate of fire was 14 rounds a minute but their sustained rate of fire was around eight rounds per minute two twin-gun mounts for license-built vickers two-pounder light aa guns were also added these guns had a maximum elevation of 80 degrees and a rate of fire of 200 rounds per minute the pair of 14 cm guns on the upper deck were removed at this time
during the mid-1930s reconstruction the torpedo tubes were removed and the vickers two-pounders were replaced by twenty license-built hotchkiss 25 mm type 96 light aa guns in 10 twin-gun mounts this was the standard japanese light aa gun during world war ii but it suffered from severe design shortcomings that rendered it a largely ineffective weapon according to historian mark stille the twin and triple mounts lacked sufficient speed in train or elevation the gun sights were unable to handle fast targets the gun exhibited excessive vibration the magazine was too small and finally the gun produced excessive muzzle blast these 25-millimetre 0.98 in guns had an effective range of 1,500–3,000 metres 1,600–3,300 yd and an effective ceiling of 5,500 metres 18,000 ft at an elevation of 85 degrees the maximum effective rate of fire was only between 110 and 120 rounds per minute because of the frequent need to change the fifteen-round magazines in addition the forward pair of 14 cm guns in the forecastle were removed at this time and the maximum elevation of the remaining guns was increased to 30 degrees
the ise-class ships'waterline protective belt had a maximum thickness of 299 mm 11.8 in of vickers cemented armour amidships below it was a strake of 100 mm 3.9 in armour the upper armoured deck consisted of two layers of high-tensile steel 55 mm 2.2 in thick and the lower armoured deck also consisted of two layers of high-tensile steel but only 30 mm 1.2 in thick the sides of this deck sloped downwards to meet the bottom of the lower strake of the belt armour the ends of the belt armour were closed off by bulkheads that ranged in thickness from 203 to 102 mm 8 to 4 in the turrets were protected with an armour thickness of 254 mm 10 in on the face and 76 mm on the roof the casemate armour was 149 mm 5.9 in thick and that of the barbettes was 299 mm thick rather than the originally planned 305 mm the sides of the conning tower were 305 mm thick
the ise class were the only japanese battleships to place the powder magazine above the shell magazine as the ijn wished to put as much space as possible between the highly flammable propellant and mine and torpedo detonations the danger from plunging shells at long distances was not appreciated until the fatal magazine explosions of three british battlecruisers during the 1916 battle of jutland graphically demonstrated the point to further protect the magazines the depth of the double bottom was increased to a total of 3.58 metres 11 ft 9 in underneath the barbettes and magazines additionally the vessels contained 660 watertight compartments to preserve buoyancy in the event of battle damage in addition to the torpedo bulge added when the ships were modernized the deck armour over the machinery and magazines was increased to a total thickness of 140 mm inside the original skin of the ships two torpedo bulkheads were also added and the turret roofs were increased to a total of 152 millimetres 6 in of armour
while the details of the ship's fire-control instruments are not fully available it is known that the ships were fitted with a fire-control director after completion no computer was fitted at that time and data from the rangefinders had to be processed manually turrets 2 3 and 5 were built with imported 6-metre 19 ft 8 in bausch lomb rangefinders these were felt to be inferior to the british barr stroud instruments used on other ships and were removed in 1920 they were replaced by either the british rangefinders or domestically built instruments of 6 or 8 metres 19 ft 8 in or 26 ft 3 in length in the late 1920s the fire-control systems were upgraded and additional platforms were added to the foremast to accommodate them a pair of directors for the 12.7 cm aa guns were added one on each side of the forward superstructure in the early 1930s the fire-control systems were again upgraded in the mid-1930s and directors were added for the 25 mm aa guns both ships had 10-metre 32 ft 10 in rangefinders installed at the top of the pagoda mast at that time type 21 air-search radars were installed aboard the sisters in mid-1942
ise was briefly fitted with an aircraft flying-off platform for a mitsubishi 1mf3 fighter on turret no. 2 in 1927 it was replaced by a platform on turret no. 5 for a yokosuka e1y reconnaissance floatplane in 1928–29 a catapult and a collapsible 4-tonne 3.9-long-ton crane were fitted on the stern during the mid-1930s modernization and the ships were equipped to operate three floatplanes although no hangar was provided the initial nakajima e4n2 biplanes were replaced by nakajima e8n2 biplanes in 1938
the sinking of the british capital ships prince of wales and repulse by japanese land-based aircraft on 10 december 1941 led the ijn to realize that battleships could not operate in the face of enemy aircraft and required friendly air support to protect them the loss of four japanese aircraft carriers during the battle of midway in june 1942 severely limited the ability of the ijn to provide any air cover and alternatives were sought earlier proposals to convert one or more battleships into carriers had been made and rejected at the beginning of the war but they were revived after midway plans for more elaborate conversions were rejected on the grounds of expense and most critically time and the ijn settled on removing the rear pair of turrets and replacing them with a flight deck equipped with two catapults to launch floatplanes the ise-class ships were selected for the conversion because hyūga had suffered an explosion in turret no. 5 in early may that virtually destroyed the turret and their turret no. 6 could not elevate to the full 43 degrees deemed necessary for the long-range engagement anticipated by the ijn the fusōs were scheduled to follow once the first two were completed
the rear turrets the barbettes and their supporting structures were removed beginning in early 1943 and the openings in the middle deck were covered by 152 mm plates salvaged from the turret armour all of the 14 cm guns were removed and the casemate openings sealed off four additional twin 12.7 cm mounts were added one pair abreast the funnel and the other abreast the conning tower the original ten twin 25 mm gun mounts were replaced by triple mounts and nine new triple mounts were added a total of 57 guns two each type 94 and type 95 aa directors were added to control the additional guns the ammunition for these new guns was stored in the magazines originally used for the 14 cm guns and for turret no. 5 during 1944 the ships'aa defences were reinforced with an additional dozen triple and eleven single 25 mm gun mounts for a total of 104 barrels and a pair of type 13 early warning radars were added in september six 30-round aa rocket launchers were added on the sides of the flight deck
a 70-metre-long 229 ft 8 in flight deck was built above the stern and stretched forward to the rebuilt aft superstructure the flight deck was 29 metres 95 ft 2 in wide at its forward end and 13 metres 42 ft 8 in at the stern it overhung the stern and increased the overall length of the ships to 219.62 metres 720 ft 6 in a pair of rotating gunpowder-propelled catapults were fitted on the sides of the hull forward of the aft superstructure where they partially restricted the arc of fire of the two amidships turrets they could launch aircraft up to 4,600 kilograms 10,100 lb in weight and required 30 seconds to launch each aircraft the flight deck had eight permanent storage positions connected by rails to the catapults and the hydraulically operated aircraft lift that brought the aircraft up from the hangar below on the trolleys used to move the floatplanes about two aircraft were intended to be stowed on the catapults and three more in temporary positions on the flight deck for a total of thirteen
the 40-metre-long 131 ft 3 in hangar was 20 metres 65 ft 7 in wide forward and 11 metres 36 ft 1 in at the rear it was 6 metres 19 ft 8 in high and designed to stow nine aircraft it was fitted with fire fighting foam and carbon dioxide dispensers as a result of wartime experience the't'-shaped lift was 12.1 metres 39 ft 8 in wide at its forward end and 6.6 metres 21 ft 8 in wide at the its aft end it was 12.1 metres long and had a capacity of 6 tonnes 5.9 long tons petrol storage tanks with a capacity of 76 tonnes 75 long tons were installed in the former magazine of turret no. 6 to provide each aircraft with enough fuel for three sorties to recover the aircraft the collapsible crane formerly on the stern was moved up to the port side of the flight deck another crane was intended on the starboard side but it was never fitted
the ships had an air group of 11 each of yokosuka d4y dive bombers allied reporting name judy and aichi e16a reconnaissance aircraft allied reporting name paul both aircraft had development problems and neither air group ever had all of its intended aircraft coupled with a shortage of trained pilots neither ship ever used its aircraft during combat
after the loss of the fast battleship hiei at the naval battle of guadalcanal in late 1942 to rudder damage the ijn decided to reinforce the protection of the steering compartment and to create an auxiliary steering compartment the protection of the former was strengthened by the addition of a concrete wall at least 1 metre 3 ft 3 in in thickness and some of the armour removed from the turrets was used to protect the latter the double bottom below the former positions of aft turrets was converted to hold fuel oil this increased the ships'endurance to 9,500 nautical miles 17,600 km 10,900 mi at a speed of 16 knots a pair of type 22 surface-search radars were also fitted during the conversion
the removal of the secondary armament the rear turrets and their supporting structures was generally compensated by the addition of the flight deck hangar aa guns and more fuel and the metacentric height increased .23 metres 9.1 in to 2.81 metres 9 ft 3 in at full load as a result of the reduction in the displacement by over 2,000 tonnes 2,000 long tons to 40,444 tonnes 39,805 long tons this also reduced the draught to 9.03 metres 29 ft 8 in the overhang of the flight deck at the stern increased the overall length to 219.62 metres 720 ft 6 in and the beam was slightly reduced to 31.71 metres 104 ft 0 in
upon commissioning the sister ships were assigned to the 1st battleship division of the 1st fleet hyūga had an explosion in one of her main gun turrets that killed 11 men and injured 25 in 1919 the following year she accidentally collided with and sank a schooner losing two crewmen before the start of the pacific war both ships frequently exercised off the coasts of the soviet union korea and china in addition to training in japanese waters ise hosted edward prince of wales and his aide-de-camp lieutenant louis mountbatten in 1922 during the prince's visit to japan in korea bay when the 1923 great kantō earthquake struck they sailed to kyushu where they loaded supplies from for the victims on 4 september together with two other battleships and a pair of light cruisers ise sank the destroyer yayoi in 1926 during gunnery practice ise's aa armament was upgraded in 1931 and hyūga's two years later the latter ship was modernized in 1934–36 and ise in 1935–37 both at kure naval arsenal during the second sino-japanese war the sisters frequently patrolled the chinese coast in support of the blockade imposed by japan in august 1937 hyūga ferried two battalions of special naval landing forces to port arthur three years later she served as the flagship for the emperor of the puppet state of manchukuo henry pu-yi during his state visit to japan in june 1940 on 15 november the ships were transferred to the 2nd battleship division of the 1st fleet the sisters were refitted in late 1940 in preparation for war which included the fitting of external degaussing coils and additional aa directors
when japan began the pacific war on 8 december the sisters sortied for the bonin islands with four other battleships and the light carrier hōshō as distant cover for the fleet attacking pearl harbor and returned six days later on 11 march 1942 ise and hyūga sortied from their anchorage at hashirajima to join the unsuccessful search for the american carrier force that had attacked marcus island a week earlier similarly they pursued but did not catch the american carriers that had launched the doolittle raid on 18 april
during gunnery training on 5 may there was a premature detonation in the left gun of hyūga's turret no. 5 that disabled both guns and killed 51 crewmen both aft magazines were flooded to douse the resulting fire and save the ship she received temporary repairs during which the turret was removed and replaced by a circular armour plate on which three triple 25 mm gun mounts were positioned on 11 may a valve in ise's no. 2 engine room stuck in the open position and flooded the engine room while under repair at kure both ships received prototype type 21 radars commanded by vice-admiral shirō takasu the 2nd battleship division set sail with the aleutian support group on 28 may at the same time that most of the imperial fleet began an attack on midway island operation mi
they returned home on 14 june and the ijn began preliminary planning to replace the lost carriers with hybrid carriers converted from battleships the sisters were selected for conversion and detached from the division on 14 july in preparation they remained on standby alert until the actual conversions began ise was converted at kure naval arsenal from 23 february to 5 september 1943 and hyūga at sasebo naval arsenal from 2 may to 30 november
after completing her sea trials ise was attached to the imperial japanese naval academy at etajima and ferried troops and munitions to the naval base at truk in october in november the ship began working up joined by the newly completed hyūga the following month and both rejoined the 2nd battleship division on 1 may 1944 the sisters were transferred to rear admiral matsuda chiaki's reformed fourth carrier division of the 3rd fleet the division's 634th naval air group was formed that same day and conducted its first catapult launches in late june
shortages of aircraft and serviceability problems greatly retarded pilot training and the ships only had a total of 17 d4ys and 18 e16as on hand on 1 october of these only 6 and 16 were operational respectively the japanese plan for the defence of the philippines envisioned that the surviving carriers would be used to lure the american carrier forces away from the invasion area to a position where the carriers could be attacked by land-based aircraft and the transports by the rest of the ijn the other carrier air groups were not in much better shape and the japanese decided to retain the aircraft ashore for use against the american carriers the fourth carrier division was assigned to the northern force under the command of vice admiral jisaburō ozawa and the sisters sailed from yashima on 20 october on the morning of 24 october the bulk of the few aircraft aboard were launched to attack the american carriers as a distraction they inflicted no damage and caused the americans to search in the direction from which they had attacked the americans finally spotted the japanese carriers at 16 40 some 200 miles 320 km east of cape engaño the northeastern tip of luzon the american carriers were spread out and it was very late in the day to launch an airstrike so admiral william halsey commander of the third fleet decided to mass his carriers in a position to attack the following morning ozawa reversed course during the night correctly believing that the americans would follow him north
although they had lost contact during the night the americans did find the japanese carriers at 07 35 they had already launched an airstrike of 180 aircraft that was orbiting 50 miles 80 km ahead of the american carriers while waiting for the japanese ships to be located this was just the first of a total of five airstrikes that the americans launched that day the sisters were not heavily engaged by the early airstrikes which are focusing on the group's aircraft carriers ise claimed to have shot down five attacking dive bombers from the second wave and one small bomb detonated on turret no. 2 hyūga was lightly damaged by near misses that rupture some hull plating in her bulge and pepper her superstructure with splinters she took on a 5-degree list that was quickly corrected before she was ordered to tow the crippled carrier chiyoda to safety her attempt was unsuccessful and chiyoda had to be abandoned to her fate
ise was attacked by 80-odd aircraft from the fourth wave but they failed to inflict any serious damage she dodged 11 torpedoes and was only hit by a bomb once on the bulge outboard of the port catapult some 34 other bombs near missed her spraying her with splinters and ruptured some hull plates that contaminated some fuel oil and caused leaks in her port boiler rooms while an exact total of her casualties is not available it has been estimated that 5 men were killed and some 111–121 crewmen were wounded during this attack hyūga was unsuccessfully attacked by an american submarine at 18 43 around 19 00 ozawa learned about a force of destroyers and cruisers that drove off the japanese destroyers rescuing survivors from some of the carriers lost earlier in the day and sank chiyoda he ordered the fourth carrier division to reverse course and engage the americans but the battleships were unable to find them and ozawa ordered them to reverse course and head for amami ōshima when they arrived on 27 october ozawa transferred to hyūga and hoisted his flag aboard her while en route for kure the division was unsuccessfully attacked by another submarine
in early november the catapults were removed from both ships and they loaded troops and munitions later that month while en route they were diverted to the spratly islands upon reports of heavy air raids at manila after off-loading their cargo they sailed for lingga island near singapore on 20 november they transferred to cam ranh bay french indochina and hyūga became flagship of the 5th fleet there on 14 december the division sailed for singapore on 30 december and vice admiral kiyohide shima transferred his flag to the light cruiser ōyodo on arrival there the following day the division continued onwards to lingga its planned return to japan was delayed by attacks by the american third fleet on targets in indochina and southern china that sank two oil tankers that were intended to refuel the division
the ijn then decided to use the sisters and their escorts to bring a load of petrol rubber tin and other strategic minerals back to japan after the american carriers departed the south china sea operation kita they loaded their cargoes beginning on 6 february at singapore and departed four days later also carrying some 1,150 oilfield workers they were escorted by ōyodo and three destroyers decrypted japanese radio signals revealed the japanese plan to the allies and 15 submarines were positioned along their anticipated route in an attempt to intercept and sink the ships an additional 11 were moved into position while the group was en route but only three were ultimately able to attack none of them were successful before the japanese reached kure on 20 february the fourth carrier division was disbanded on 1 march and the sisters were reduced to 1st rank reserve ships on 19 march kure was attacked by aircraft from task force 58 and hyūga was hit three times by bombs that killed 37 men and wounded 52 her gunners claimed to have shot down one american dive bomber during the attack ise was hit twice during the attack but her casualties if any are unknown
the ships were turned into floating aa batteries over the next several months although it availed them little when they were attacked again by american carrier aircraft in july on the 24th ise was struck by five bombs and near missed multiple times all told she lost 50 crewmen killed and many others wounded the bombs started numerous leaks and ise began to settle by the bow although she was returned to an even keel after three-days pumping hyūga was a primary focus of the attack and she received 10 direct hits and up to 30 near misses she was badly damaged with some 200-odd crewmen killed and 600 wounded during the attack she slowly foundered over the next two days and was not attacked when the americans returned four days later this time it was ise's turn and she was struck 11 or more times with many near misses that put her on the bottom in shallow water with a 15 degree list the sisters were struck off the navy list in november and their wrecks were scrapped after the war

it is ironic that rifenburg was born in petoskey michigan in 1926 for several reasons ted petoskey preceded rifenburg as an all-american end on the university of michigan football team petoskey had excelled as a representative of saginaw county in mhsaa competition petoskey posted significant football accomplishments in 1926 making 1926 a significant year for himself as well achieving all-american status as an end at michigan would be rifenburg's next step after excelling in mhsaa competition
in the fall of 1944 rifenburg enrolled at the university of michigan the united press syndicate ran a feature article about rifenburg in september 1944 that opened as follows another great end has made his appearance on the big ten football horizon in the person of dick rifenburg 18-year-old michigan freshman every so often a great offensive end comes along a player who has to learn how to play defense but who has the natural speed smooth actions height and big hands that is the mark of an outstanding pass receiver rifenburg has laid claim to that rating a loose-limbed 180-pound freshman from saginaw mich rifenberg is being boomed as the big ten's next'freshman sensation .'" as a freshman he caught two touchdown passes in his first college football game against iowa in an article titled teens and tnt time reported on rifenburg's performance of the few teams already in action michigan's teens rang the freshman bell loudest last week by winning their opener 12 -to-7 against the strong iowa seahawks naval pre-flight 6-ft 4 freshman end dick rifenburg caught passes and ran for both michigan touchdowns

although rifenburg finished fourth among midwestern heisman voters in 1948 he did not finish among the top eight by comparison notre dame end leon hart won the heisman trophy in 1949 but made only eight of the 11 all-american teams it is not clear why rifenburg did not finish higher however it is fairly clear that sportswriters of that era had a bias against michigan in the associated press poll at the end of the 1947 season the notre dame fighting irish were ranked ahead of the university of michigan though both teams were undefeated some noted that every southern ap voter had voted for notre dame which had yet to integrate whereas three of michigan's star players bob mann gene derricotte and len ford were african-american the southern schools refused even to schedule games against schools that played african-american players

the 1933 treasure coast hurricane was the second-most intense tropical cyclone to strike the united states during the active 1933 atlantic hurricane season the eleventh tropical storm fifth hurricane and the third major hurricane of the season it formed east-northeast of the leeward islands on august 31 the tropical storm moved rapidly west-northwestward steadily intensifying to a hurricane it acquired peak winds of 140 miles per hour 225 km h and passed over portions of the bahamas on september 3 including eleuthera and harbour island causing severe damage to crops buildings and infrastructure winds over 100 mph 161 km h affected many islands in its path especially those that encountered its center and many wharves were ruined
subsequently it weakened and made landfall at jupiter florida early on september 4 with winds of 125 mph 201 km h the hurricane moved across the state passing near tampa before moving into georgia and dissipating in florida the strong winds of the cyclone blew buildings off their foundations and numerous trees were prostrated in citrus groves the treasure coast region received the most extensive destruction and stuart jupiter and fort pierce were heavily damaged inland the cyclone weakened rapidly but produced prodigious amounts of rain causing a dam to collapse near tampa the storm caused 3 million in damage 1933 usd after damaging or destroying 6,848 homes
unusually the storm hit florida less than 24 hours before another major hurricane bearing 125-mile-per-hour 201 km h winds struck south texas never have two major cyclones hit the united states in such close succession
the origins of the hurricane were from a tropical wave that possibly spawned a tropical depression on august 27 although there was minimal data over the next few days as it tracked to the west-northwest on august 31 a nearby ship reported gale force winds which indicated that a tropical storm had developed to the east-northeast of the lesser antilles based on continuity it is estimated the storm attained hurricane status later that day moving quickly to the west-northwest the storm passed north of the lesser antilles and puerto rico early on september 2 a ship called the gulfwing reported a barometric pressure of 978 mbar 28.88 inhg which confirmed that the storm attained hurricane status after passing north of the turks and caicos islands the hurricane struck eleuthera and harbour island in the bahamas on september 3 the latter at 1100 utc a station on the latter island reported a pressure of 27.90 inhg 945 mb during the 30 minute passage of the eye based on the pressure and the small size of the storm it is estimated the hurricane struck harbour island with peak winds of 140 mph 225 km h making it the equivalent of a modern category 4 hurricane on the saffir-simpson scale interpolation suggested that the storm reached major hurricane status or category 3 status on september 2
the hurricane initially followed the course of another hurricane that passed through the area in late august which ultimately struck cuba and texas this hurricane instead maintained a general west-northwest track after moving through the northern bahamas the hurricane weakened slightly before making landfall at jupiter florida at 0500 utc on september 4 a station there reported a pressure of 27.98 inhg 948 mb during a 40 minute period of the eye's passage this suggested a landfall strength of 125 mph 201 km h at the time the radius of maximum winds was 15 mi 24 km which was smaller than average after landfall the hurricane weakened rapidly while crossing the state it briefly emerged into the gulf of mexico as a tropical storm early on september 5 a few hours later while continuing to the northwest it made another landfall near rosewood — a ghost town in levy county east of cedar key — with winds of about 65 mph 105 km h turning to the north the storm slowly weakened as it crossed into georgia dissipating on september 7 near augusta
on september 2 a fleet of eight aircraft evacuated all white residents from west end grand bahama to daytona beach florida while the storm was near peak intensity on september 3 the weather bureau issued hurricane warnings from miami to melbourne florida with storm warnings extending northward to jacksonville later that day storm warnings were issued from key west to cedar key about 2,500 people evacuated by train from areas around lake okeechobee by evening on september 3 high tides sent sea spray over coastal seawalls in palm beach county as residents boarded up buildings structures on clematis street in west palm beach were said to be a solid front of plywood along the coast observers reported very rough seas as the eye neared land
the powerful hurricane moved over or near several islands in the bahamas winds on spanish wells and harbour island were both estimated at around 140 mph 225 km h winds reached 110 mph 177 km h at governor's harbour 100 mph 161 km h on eleuthera and 120 mph 193 km h on the abaco islands the storm was farther away from nassau where winds reached 61 mph 98 km h the hurricane damaged a lumber mill on abaco washing away a dock heavy damage occurred on harbour island including to several roofs the walls of government buildings and the water system the hurricane destroyed four churches and 37 houses leaving 100 people homeless a 1.5 mi 2.4 km road on eleuthera was destroyed several islands sustained damage to farms including the total loss of various fruit trees on russell island despite category 4 winds on spanish wells only five houses were destroyed although most of the remaining dwellings lost their roofs collectively between north point james cistern and gregory town on eleuthera the storm destroyed 55 houses and damaged many others on grand bahama where a 9 to 12 ft 2.7 to 3.7 m storm surge was reported half of the houses were destroyed as were 13 boats and two planes and most docks were wrecked
when the storm moved ashore in florida winds reached an estimated 125 mph 201 km h in jupiter these occurred after the eye passed in west palm beach anemometers measured at least 80-mile-per-hour 129 km h winds with gusts to 100 mph 161 km h barometers ranged from 28.64 to 28.78 inhg 970 to 975 mb the storm produced the strongest winds in the city since the 1928 okeechobee hurricane winds were not as strong farther from the center 40 to 45 mph 64 to 72 km h winds were observed in miami to the south titusville to the north and tampa on the west coast fort pierce estimated peak winds of 80 to 90 mph 129 to 145 km h and pressures dipped to 29.14 inhg 987 mb inland winds near lake okeechobee peaked at only 60 mph 97 km h the hurricane dropped heavy rainfall along its path peaking at 17.8 in 450 mm in clermont
at west palm beach the majority of the damage was confined to vegetation several coconut and royal palms that withstood the 1928 hurricane snapped littering streets with broken trunks winds downed road signs on many streets and floodwaters covered the greens on a local golf course some garages and isolated structures mostly lightweight were partly or totally destroyed along with a lumber warehouse some homes that lost roofing shingles had water damage to their interiors as well nearby lake worth sustained extensive breakage of windows including plate glass and loss of tile and shingle roofing but preparations reduced losses to just several thousand dollars and no post-storm accidents took place strong winds snapped many light poles in the city and trees and shrubs were broken or uprooted as in lake worth officials in west palm beach credited preparations and stringent building codes with reducing overall damage the city had learned from previous experience with severe storms in 1926 1928 and 1929 high tides eroded ocean boulevard at several spots and disrupted access to several bridges on the lake worth lagoon winter estates and hotels on palm beach generally sustained little material damage except to vegetation and county properties went largely unscathed
in martin and st. lucie counties the storm was considered among the worst on record the storm leveled some homes and swept many others off their foundations at stuart winds removed or badly damaged 75 of the roofs in town the storm destroyed the third floor of the building that housed a bowling alley and the stuart news a local newspaper at olympia an abandoned settlement also known as olympia beach strong winds leveled the old olympia inn a gas station and the second floor of a pharmaceutical building winds also tore the roof off an ice plant a bridge leading to the barrier island from olympia was partly wrecked the bridge tender survived by gripping the railing during the storm winds leveled his nearby home according to the monthly weather review some of the most severe damage from the storm in florida was at olympia the storm left many homes in hobe sound uninhabitable forcing crews to tear them down winter estates on the island however were better built and little damaged while stuart and hobe sound sustained significant damage port salerno suffered minimally in stuart the storm left 400 to 500 people homeless up to nearly 10 of the population which was 5,100 at the time between jupiter and fort pierce the storm knocked down power and telegraph lines in the latter city high waves washed out a portion of the causeway in the 1980s an elderly resident recalled that the storm was the most severe on record in fort pierce
crop damage was worst along the indian river lagoon several farms in stuart experienced total losses and statewide 16 of the citrus crop or 4 million boxes were destroyed many chicken coops in stuart were destroyed and the local chicken population was scattered and dispersed as far as indiantown across southeastern florida the hurricane damaged 6,465 houses and destroyed another 383 causing over 3 million in damage one person an african american farm worker was killed when his shack blew down in gomez a brakeman died after seven railcars derailed and a child was killed by airborne debris
high rainfall caused flooding across florida notably near tampa where waters reached 9 ft 2.7 m deep high rainfall of over 7 in 180 mm caused a dam operated by tampa electric co. to break 3 mi 4.8 km northeast of tampa along the hillsborough river the break resulted in severe local damage flooding portions of sulphur springs workers attempted to save the dam with sandbags and after the break most residents in the area were warned of the approaching flood over 50 homes were flooded forcing about 150 people to evacuate outside florida the storm produced winds of 48 and 51 mph 78 and 81 km h in savannah georgia and charleston south carolina respectively in the latter city the storm spawned a tornado which caused about 10,000 in property damage heavy rainfall occurred along the georgia and south carolina coasts reaching over 12 in 300 mm light rainfall also extended into north carolina
in the bahamas after the storm a boat sailed from nassau to deliver food and building materials to eleuthera
after the storm the national guard offered shelters for at least 400 homeless residents in stuart of the 7,900 families adversely affected by the hurricane 4,325 required assistance from the american red cross farmers in texas also affected by a major hurricane requested growers in florida wait 15 days so they could sell their citrus crop that fell the damaged dam near tampa initially resulted in waters from the hillsborough river being pumped into the city's water treatment plant and a new dam was eventually built in 1944
the second battle of naktong bulge was an engagement between united nations un and north korean nk forces early in the korean war from september 1 to september 15 1950 along the naktong river in south korea it was a part of the battle of pusan perimeter and was one of several large engagements fought simultaneously the battle ended in a victory for the united nations after large numbers of united states us and republic of korea rok troops repelled a strong north korean attack
after the first battle of naktong bulge the us army's 2nd infantry division was moved to defend the naktong river line the division which was untried in combat was struck with a strong attack by several divisions of the korean people's army which crossed the river and struck all along the division's line the force of the attack split the us 2nd infantry division in half and the north koreans were able to penetrate to yongsan promoting a fight there
the urgency of the threat to pusan perimeter prompted the us marine corps 1st provisional marine brigade to be brought in to reinforce the us army troops in two weeks of heavy fighting the us forces were able to force the north koreans out of the naktong bulge region the north koreans were further repulsed after the un counterattack at inchon which culminated in the virtual destruction of the north korean army
from the outbreak of the korean war and the invasion of south korea by the north the north korean people's army had enjoyed superiority in both manpower and equipment over both the republic of korea army and the united nations forces dispatched to south korea to prevent it from collapsing the north korean strategy was to aggressively pursue un and rok forces on all avenues of approach south and to engage them aggressively attacking from the front and initiating a double envelopment of both flanks of the unit which allowed the north koreans to surround and cut off the opposing force which would then be forced to retreat in disarray often leaving behind much of its equipment from their initial june 25 offensive to fights in july and early august the north koreans used this strategy to effectively defeat any un force and push it south however when the un forces under the eighth united states army established the pusan perimeter in august the un troops held a continuous line along the peninsula which north korean troops could not flank and their advantages in numbers decreased daily as the superior un logistical system brought in more troops and supplies to the un army
when the north koreans approached the pusan perimeter on august 5 they attempted the same frontal assault technique on the four main avenues of approach into the perimeter throughout august the nk 6th division and later the nk 7th division engaged the us 25th infantry division at the battle of masan initially repelling a un counteroffensive before countering with battles at komam-ni and battle mountain these attacks stalled as un forces well equipped and with plenty of reserves repeatedly repelled north korean attacks north of masan the nk 4th division and the us 24th infantry division sparred in the naktong bulge area in the first battle of naktong bulge the north korean division was unable to hold its bridgehead across the river as large numbers of us reserve forces were brought in to repel it and on august 19 the nk 4th division was forced back across the river with 50 percent casualties in the taegu region five north korean divisions were repulsed by three un divisions in several attempts to attack the city during the battle of taegu particularly heavy fighting took place at the battle of the bowling alley where the nk 13th division was almost completely destroyed in the attack on the east coast three more north korean divisions were repulsed by the south koreans at p 'ohang-dong during the battle of p 'ohang-dong all along the front the north korean troops were reeling from these defeats the first time in the war their strategies were not working
in planning its new offensive the north korean command decided any attempt to flank the un force was impossible thanks to the support of the un navy instead they opted to use frontal attack to breach the perimeter and collapse it as the only hope of achieving success in the battle fed by intelligence from the soviet union the north koreans were aware the un forces were building up along the pusan perimeter and that it must conduct an offensive soon or it could not win the battle a secondary objective was to surround taegu and destroy the un and rok units in that city as part of this mission the north korean units would first cut the supply lines to taegu
on august 20 the north korean commands distributed operations orders to their subordinate units the north koreans called for a simultaneous five-prong attack against the un lines these attacks would overwhelm the un defenders and allow the north koreans to break through the lines in at least one place to force the un forces back five battle groupings were ordered the center attack called for the nk 9th division nk 4th division nk 2nd division and nk 10th division break through the us 2nd infantry division at the naktong bulge to miryang and yongsan
during the north koreans'september 1 offensive the us 25th infantry division's us 35th infantry regiment was heavily engaged in the battle of nam river north of masan on the 35th regiment's right flank just north of the confluence of the nam river and the naktong river was the us 9th infantry regiment us 2nd infantry division there in the southernmost part of the 2nd infantry division zone the 9th infantry regiment held a sector more than 20,000 yards 18,000 m long including the bulge area of the naktong where the first battle of naktong bulge had taken place earlier in august each us infantry company on the river line here had a front of 3,000 feet 910 m to 4,000 feet 1,200 m and they held only key hills and observation points as the units were extremely spread out along the wide front
during the last week of august us troops on these hills could see minor north korean activity across the river which they thought was north koreans organizing the high ground on the west side of the naktong against a possible american attack there were occasional attacks on the 9th infantry's forward positions but to the men in the front lines this appeared to be only a standard patrol action on august 31 the un forces were alerted to a pending attack when much of the korean civilian labor force fled the front lines intelligence officers reported an attack was coming
on the west side of the naktong north korean major general pak kyo sam commanding the nk 9th division issued his operations order to the division on august 28 its mission in the forthcoming attack was to outflank and destroy the us troops at naktong bulge by capturing the miryang and samnangjin areas to cut off the us 2nd division's route of supply and withdrawal between taegu and pusan however the north koreans weren 't aware that the us 2nd infantry division had recently replaced the us 24th infantry division in positions along the naktong river consequently they expected lighter resistance the 24th troops were exhausted from months of fighting but the 2nd division men were fresh and newly arrived in korea they had only recently been moved into the line the north koreans began crossing the naktong river under cover of darkness at certain points
on the southern-most flank of the 9th infantry river line just above the junction of the nam river with the naktong a company of the 1st battalion was dug in on a long finger ridge paralleling the naktong that terminates in hill 94 at the kihang ferry site the river road from namji-ri running west along the naktong passes the southern tip of this ridge and crosses to the west side of the river at the ferry a small village called agok lay at the base of hill 94 and 300 yards 270 m from the river a patrol of tanks and armored vehicles together with two infantry squads of a company 9th infantry held a roadblock near the ferry and close to agok on the evening of august 31 a company moved from its ridge positions overlooking agok and the river to new positions along the river below the ridge line
that evening sergeant ernest r. kouma led the patrol of two m26 pershing tanks and two m19 gun motor carriages in agok kouma placed his patrol on the west side of agok near the kihang ferry at 20 00 a heavy fog covered the river and at 22 00 mortar shells began falling on the american-held side of the river by 22 15 this strike intensified and north korean mortar preparation struck a company's positions american mortars and artillery began firing counterbattery some of the a company men reported they heard noises on the opposite side of the river and splashes in the water
at 22 30 the fog lifted and kouma saw that a north korean pontoon bridge was being laid across the river directly in front of his position kouma's four vehicles attacked this structure and after about a minute of heavy fire the bridge collapsed and the ponton boats used to hold the bridge in place were sunk at 23 00 a small arms fight flared around the left side of a company north of the tanks this gunfire had lasted only two or three minutes when the a company roadblock squads near the tanks received word by field telephone that the company was withdrawing to the original ridge positions and that they should do likewise
kouma's patrol was then ambushed by a group of north koreans dressed in us military uniforms kouma was wounded and the other three vehicles had to withdraw but he held the agok site until 07 30 the next morning with his single tank in the attack against a company the north koreans hit the 1st platoon which was near agok but they did not find the 2nd platoon northward
the nk 9th division's infantry crossing of the naktong and attack on its east side near midnight quickly overran the positions of c company north of a company there the north koreans assaulted in force signaled by green flares and blowing of whistles the company held its positions only a short time and then attempted to escape many of the men moved south a few of them coming into a company's ridge line positions near agok during the night most of c company moved all the way to the 25th division positions south of the naktong on september 1 that division reported that 110 men of c company had come into its lines
meanwhile 5 miles 8.0 km north of agok and a company's position b company 9th infantry held a similar position on hill 209 overlooking the paekchin ferry crossing of the river this ferry was located at the middle of the naktong bulge where the yongsan road came down to the naktong and crossed it the us 2nd infantry division had planned a reconnaissance mission to start from there the night of august 31 the same night that the nk i corps offensive rolled across the river
near the end of the month two reconnaissance patrols from the 9th infantry had crossed to the west side of the naktong and observed north korean tank and troop activity 2 miles 3.2 km west of the river information obtained later indicated it was in fact the command post of the nk 9th division on august 25 9th infantry commander colonel john g. hill outlined projected operation manchu which was to be a company-sized combat patrol to cross the river advance to the suspected north korean command post and communications center destroy it capture prisoners and collect intelligence
the 9th infantry regiment had planned task force manchu on orders from the 2nd division commander major general laurence b. keiser which in turn had received instructions from eighth united states army commander lieutenant general walton walker for aggressive patrolling keiser decided the patrol should cross the river at the paekchin ferry the 9th infantry reserve e company reinforced with one section of light machine guns from h company was to be the attack force the 1st platoon 2nd engineer combat battalion was to transport it across the river in assault boats the night of august 31 two heavy weapons companies d and h were each to furnish one section of heavy machine guns one section of 81-mm. mortars and one section of 75-mm. recoilless rifles for supporting fires a platoon of 4.2-inch mortars was also to give support
after dark on august 31 first lieutenant charles i. caldwell of d company and first lieutenant edward schmitt of h company 9th infantry moved their men and weapons to the base of hill 209 which was within b company's defense sector and overlooked the paekchin ferry crossing of the naktong river the raiding force e company was still in its regimental reserve position about 2 miles 3.2 km west of yongsan getting ready with the engineer platoon to move to the crossing site colonel hill went forward in the evening with the 4.2-inch mortar platoon to its position at the base of hill 209 where the mortarmen prepared to set up their weapons
by 21 00 the closest front line unit was b company on top of hill 209 1 mile 1.6 km north of the river road which curved around the hill's southern base the regimental chaplain captain lewis b. sheen had gone forward in the afternoon to b company to hold services on top of hill 209 chaplain sheen and men in b company after dark heard splashing in the water below them they soon discovered a long line of north korean soldiers wading the river
the first north korean crossing at the paekchin ferry caught the heavy mortar platoon unprepared in the act of setting up its weapons it also caught most of the d and h company men at the base of hill 209 .5 miles 0.80 km from the crossing site the north koreans killed or captured many of the troops there hill was there but escaped to the rear just before midnight together with several others when the division canceled operation manchu because of the attacks the first heavy weapons carrying party was on its way up the hill when the north korean attack engulfed the men below it hurried on to the top where the advance group waited and there all hastily dug in on a small perimeter this group was not attacked during the night
from 21 30 until shortly after midnight the nk 9th division crossed the naktong at a number of places and climbed the hills quietly toward the 9th infantry river line positions then when the artillery barrage preparation lifted the north korean infantry were in position to launch their assaults these began in the northern part of the regimental sector and quickly spread southward at each crossing site the north koreans would overwhelm local un defenders before building pontoon bridges for their vehicles and armor
at 02 00 b company was attacked a truck stopped at the bottom of the hill a whistle sounded then came a shouted order and north korean soldiers started climbing the slope the hills on both sides of b company were already under attack as was also hill 311 a rugged terrain feature a 1.5 miles 2.4 km from the river and the north koreans'principal immediate objective the north koreans apparently were not aware of the task force manchu group lower down on the hill and it was not attacked during the night but higher up on hill 209 the north koreans drove b company from its position inflicting very heavy casualties on it sheen led one group of soldiers back to friendly lines on 4 september
at 03 00 1 september the 9th infantry regiment ordered its only reserve e company to move west along the yongsan-naktong river road and take a blocking position at the pass between cloverleaf hill and obong-ni ridge 3 miles 4.8 km from the river and 6 miles 9.7 km from yongsan this was the critical terrain where so much heavy fighting had taken place in the first battle of the naktong bulge fighting began at the pass at 02 30 when an american medium tank of a company 72nd tank battalion knocked out a t-34 at tugok also called morisil e company never reached its blocking position a strong north korean force surprised and delivered heavy automatic fire on it at 03 30 from positions astride the road east of the pass the company suffered heavy casualties including the company commander and keiser's aide who had accompanied the force with the critical parts of cloverleaf hill and obong-ni ridge the best defensive terrain between yongsan and the river the north koreans controlled the high ground the us 2nd infantry division now had to base its defense of yongsan on relatively poor defensive terrain the low hills at the western edge of the town
north of the 9th infantry sector of the 2nd infantry division front along the naktong the us 23rd infantry regiment on august 29 had just relieved the 3rd battalion of the us 38th infantry regiment which in turn had only a few days before relieved the us 21st infantry regiment of the us 24th infantry division on august 1 the 23rd regiment was in a new sector of which it had only a limited knowledge it took over a 16,000 yards 15,000 m naktong river front without its 3rd battalion which had been attached to the us 1st cavalry division to the north colonel paul l. freeman the regimental commander deployed the 1st battalion on the high ground along the river with the three companies abreast the 1st battalion under us lieutenant colonel claire e. hutchin jr outposted the hills with platoons and squads he placed the 2nd battalion in a reserve position 8 miles 13 km behind the 1st battalion and in a position where it commanded the road net in the regimental sector on august 31h the 2nd division moved e company south to a reserve position in the 9th infantry sector
two roads ran through the regimental sector from the naktong river to changnyong the main road bent south along the east bank of the river to pugong-ni and then turned northeast to changnyong a northern secondary road curved around marshland and lakes the largest of which was lake u-p 'o to changnyong in effect the 1st battalion of the 23rd regiment guarded these two approach routes to changnyong
the 42 men of the 2nd platoon b company 23rd infantry held outpost positions on seven hills covering a 2,600 yards 2,400 m front along the east bank of the naktong north of pugong-ni across the river in the rice paddies they could see in the afternoon of august 31 two large groups of north korean soldiers occasionally artillery fire dispersed them just before dark the platoon saw a column of north koreans come out of the hills and proceed toward the river they immediately reported to the battalion command post the artillery forward observer who estimated the column at 2,000 people thought they were refugees freeman immediately ordered the artillery to fire on the column reducing its number however the north koreans continued their advance
at 21 00 the first shells of what proved to be a two-hour north korean artillery and mortar preparation against the american river positions of 2nd platoon as the barrage rolled on north korean infantry crossed the river and climbed the hills in the darkness under cover of its fire at 23 00 the barrage lifted and the north koreans attacked 2nd platoon forcing it from the hill after a short fight similar assaults took place elsewhere along the battalion outpost line
on the regimental left along the main pugong-ni-changnyong road north korean soldiers completely overran c company by 0300 september 1 only seven men of c company could be accounted for and three days later after all the stragglers and those cut off behind north korean lines had come in there were only 20 men in the company as the north korean attack developed during the night 1st battalion succeeded in withdrawing a large part of its force less c company just north of lake u-p 'o and the hills there covering the northern road into changnyong 3 miles 4.8 km east of the river and 5 miles 8.0 km west of the town b company lost heavily in this action
when word of the disaster that had overtaken 1st battalion reached regimental headquarters freeman obtained the release of g and f companies from 2nd division reserve and sent the former to help 1st battalion and the latter on the southern road toward pugong-ni and c company major lloyd k. jenson executive officer of the 2nd battalion accompanied f company down the pugong-ni road this force was unable to reach c company but jenson collected stragglers from it and seized high ground astride this main approach to changnyong near ponch 'o-ri above lake sanorho and went into a defensive position there the us 2nd division released e company to the regiment and the next day it joined f company to build up what became the main defensive position of the 23d regiment in front of changnyong north korean troops during the night passed around the right flank of 1st battalion's northern blocking position and reached the road three miles behind him near the division artillery positions the 23rd infantry headquarters and service companies and other miscellaneous regimental units finally stopped this penetration near the regimental command post 5 miles 8.0 km northwest of changnyong
before the morning of 1 september had passed reports coming in to us 2nd division headquarters made it clear that north koreans had penetrated to the north-south changnyong-yongsan road and cut the division in two the 38th and 23d infantry regiments with the bulk of the division artillery in the north were separated from the division headquarters and the 9th infantry regiment in the south keiser decided that this situation made it advisable to control and direct the divided division as two special forces accordingly he placed the division artillery commander brigadier general loyal m. haynes in command of the northern group haynes'command post was 7 miles 11 km north of changnyong task force haynes became operational at 10 20 september 1 southward in the yongsan area keiser placed brigadier general joseph s. bradley assistant division commander in charge of the 9th infantry regiment the 2nd engineer combat battalion most of the 72nd tank battalion and other miscellaneous units of the division this southern grouping was known as task force bradley
all three regiments of the nk 2nd division-the 4th 17th and 6th in line from north to south-crossed during the night to the east side of the naktong river into the 23rd regiment sector the nk 2nd division concentrated in the sinban-ni area west of the river had in effect attacked straight east across the river and was trying to seize the two avenues of advance into changnyong above and below lake u-p 'o on august 31 1950 lake u-p 'o was a large body of water although in most places very shallow
at dawn september 1 keiser at 2nd division headquarters in muan-ni 7 miles 11 km east of yongsan on the miryang road felt his division was in the midst of a crisis the massive north korean attack had made deep penetrations everywhere in the division sector except in the north in the zone of the 38th infantry the nk 9th division had effected major crossings of the naktong at two principal points against the us 9th infantry the nk 2nd division in the meantime had made three major crossings against the us 23rd infantry and the nk 10th division had begun crossing more troops in the hill 409 area near hyongp 'ung in the us 38th infantry sector at 08 10 keiser telephoned eighth army headquarters and reported the heaviest and deepest north korean penetrations were in the 9th infantry sector
liaison planes rose from the division strip every hour to observe the north korean progress and to locate us 2nd infantry division front-line units communication from division and regimental headquarters to nearly all the forward units was broken beginning at 09 30 and continuing throughout the rest of the day the light aviation section of the division artillery located front-line units cut off by the north koreans and made fourteen airdrops of ammunition food water and medical supplies as information slowly built up at division headquarters it became apparent that the north koreans had punched a hole 6 miles 9.7 km wide and 8 miles 13 km deep in the middle of the division line and made less severe penetrations elsewhere the front-line battalions of the us 9th and 23rd regiments were in various states of disorganization and some companies had virtually disappeared keiser hoped he could organize a defense along the changnyong-yongsan road east of the naktong river and prevent north korean access to the passes eastward leading to miryang and ch 'ongdo
at 09 00 walker requested the us air force to make a maximum effort along the naktong river from toksong-dong just above the us 2nd division boundary southward and to a depth of 15 miles 24 km west of the river he wanted the air force to isolate the battlefield and prevent further north korean reinforcements and supplies from moving across the river in support of the north korean spearhead units the far east command requested the us navy to join in the air effort and the us seventh fleet turned back from its strikes in the inch 'on-seoul area and sped southward at full steam toward the southern battle front walker came to the us 2nd division front at 12 00 and ordered the division to hold at all costs he had already ordered ground reinforcements to the yongsan area
during the morning of 1 september walker weighed the news coming in from his southern front wavering in a decision as to which part of the front most needed his pusan perimeter reserves since midnight the nk i corps had broken his pusan perimeter in two places-the nk 2nd and 9th divisions in the us 2nd division sector and the nk 7th division and nk 6th division in the us 25th division sector below the junction of the nam and naktong rivers in the us 2nd division sector north korean troops were at the edge of yongsan the gateway to the corridor leading 12 miles 19 km eastward to miryang and the main pusan-mukden railroad and highway
eighth army had in reserve three understrength infantry regiments and the 2-battalion british 27th infantry brigade which was not yet completely equipped and ready to be placed in line the 1st provisional marine brigade at changwon 6 miles 9.7 km northeast of masan preparing for movement to the port of pusan the us 27th infantry regiment of the 25th division which had arrived at masan only the night before at 20 30 to relieve the 5th regimental combat team which was then to join the 24th division in the taegu area and the us 19th infantry regiment of the us 24th infantry division then with that division's headquarters at kyongsan southeast of taegu walker alerted both the 24th division headquarters together with its 19th regiment and the 1st provisional marine brigade to move at a moment's notice the 24th division either to the 2nd or 25th division fronts and the marines to an unannounced destination
as the morning passed general walker decided that the situation was most critical in the naktong bulge area of the us 2nd division sector there the north koreans threatened miryang and with it the entire eighth army position at 11 00 walker ordered us marine corps brigadier general edward a. craig commanding the 1st provisional marine brigade to prepare the marines to move at once the marines made ready to depart for the naktong bulge at 13 30
the situation on the front was chaotic during the day september 1 the north koreans at one place had crossed at the kihang ferry captured agok and scattered a company 9th infantry at its positions from agok northward a company withdrew to positions on the ridge line back of the river from there at daylight the men could see north korean soldiers on many of the ridges surrounding them most of them moving east after several hours 2nd platoon of a company sent a patrol down the hill to agok to obtain supplies abandoned there during the night returning later with much needed water rations and ammunition
later in the morning north korean barges crossed the naktong below a company the company sent a squad with a light machine gun to the southern tip of the ridge overlooking agok to take these troops under fire when the squad reached the tip of the ridge they saw that a north korean force occupied houses at its base the company hit these houses with artillery the north koreans broke from the houses running for the river at this the light machine gun at the tip of the ridge took them under fire as did another across the naktong to the south in the us 25th infantry division sector proximity fuze artillery fire decimated this group combined fire from all weapons inflicted an estimated 300 casualties on this north korean force in the afternoon us aircraft dropped food and ammunition to the company only part of it was recovered the 1st battalion ordered a company to withdraw the company that night
during the withdraw however a company ran into a sizable north korean force and had scattered in the ensuing fight most of the company including its commander were killed at close range in this desperate action private first class luther h. story a weapons squad leader fought so tenaciously that he was awarded the medal of honor badly wounded story refused to be a burden to those who might escape and when last seen was still engaging north korean at close range of those in the company approximately ten men escaped to friendly lines the next morning under heavy fog the group made its way by compass toward yongsan from a hill at 12 00 after the fog had lifted the men looked down on the battle of yongsan which was then in progress that afternoon 20 survivors of the company merged into the lines of the 72nd tank battalion near yongsan stragglers from this position continued to stream in the next few days as well
in the meantime task force manchu was still holding its position along the naktong river about 5 miles 8.0 km north of where a company had been destroyed on the southern end of the line the perimeter position taken by the men of d and h companies 9th infantry who had started up the hill before the north koreans struck was on a southern knob of hill 209 0.5 miles 0.80 km south of b company's higher position in addition to the d and h company men there were a few from the heavy mortar platoon and one or two from b company altogether 60 to 70 men were in the group the group had an scr-300 radio a heavy machine gun two light machine gun a m1918 browning automatic rifle about 20 m1 garand rifles and about 40 carbines or pistols schmitt assumed command of the group
during the night schmitt established radio communication with the 1st battalion 9th infantry when daylight came schmitt and his group saw that they were surrounded by north koreans one force occupied the higher knob half a mile above them formerly held by b company below them north koreans continued crossing the river and moving supplies forward to their combat units some of them already several miles eastward the north koreans quickly discovered task force manchu group they first attacked it at 14 00 that afternoon and were repulsed that night an estimated company attacked three times pressing the fight to close quarters but failed each time to penetrate the tight us perimeter daylight of the second day disclosed many north korean dead on the steep slopes outside the perimeter
in the afternoon of september 2 schmitt radioed 1st battalion for an airdrop of supplies a us plane attempted the drop but the perimeter was so small and the slopes so steep that virtually all the supplies went into north korean hands the men in the perimeter did however recover from a drop made later at 19 00 some supplies and ammunition private first class joseph r. ouellette of h company left the perimeter to gather weapons ammunition and grenades from the north korean dead on several occasions he was attacked and on one such occasion a north korean soldier suddenly attacked ouellette who killed the north korean in hand-to-hand combat
that same afternoon the north koreans sent an american prisoner up the hill to schmitt with the message you have one hour to surrender or be blown to pieces failing in frontal infantry attack to reduce the little defending force the north koreans now meant to take it under mortar fire only 45 minutes later north korean antitank fire came in on the knob and two machine guns from positions northward and higher on the slope of hill 209 swept the perimeter soon mortars emplaced on a neighboring high finger ridge eastward registered on schmitt's perimeter and continued firing until dark the machine gun fire forced every man to stay in his foxhole the lifting of the mortar fire after dark was the signal for renewed north korean infantry attacks all of which were repulsed but the number of killed and wounded within the perimeter was growing and supplies were diminishing there were no medical supplies except those carried by one aid man
the third day september 3 the situation worsened the weather was hot and ammunition food and supplies were nearly completely exhausted since the previous afternoon north korean mortar barrages had alternated with infantry assaults against the perimeter survivors later estimated there were about twenty separate infantry attacks repulsed two north korean machine guns still swept the perimeter whenever anyone showed himself dead and dying us troops were in almost every foxhole mortar fragments destroyed the radio and this ended all communication with other us units artillery fire and air strikes requested by schmitt never came some north koreans worked their way close to the perimeter and threw grenades into it six times ouellette leaped from his foxhole to escape grenades thrown into it in this close action ouellette was killed most of the foxholes of the perimeter received one or more direct mortar hits in the course of the continuing mortar fire one of these killed schmitt on september 3 the command passed now to first lieutenant raymond j. mcdoniel of d company senior surviving officer
at daylight on the morning of 4 september only two officers and approximately half the men who had assembled on the hill were alive as the day passed with ammunition down to about one clip per man and only a few grenades left and no help in sight mcdoniel decided to abandon the position that night when it got dark the survivors would split into small groups and try to get back to friendly lines that evening after dark the north koreans launched another weak attack against the position at 22 00 mcdoniel and caldwell and 27 enlisted men slipped off the hill in groups of four master sergeant travis e. watkins still alive in his paralyzed condition refused efforts of evacuation saying that he did not want to be a burden to those who had a chance to get away he asked only that his carbine be loaded and placed on his chest with the muzzle under his chin like oullette he would also win the medal of honor for his actions of the 29 men who came off the hill the night of september 4 22 escaped to friendly lines many of them following the naktong downstream hiding by day and traveling by night until they reached the lines of the us 25th infantry division
members of task force manchu who escaped from hill 209 brought back considerable intelligence information of north korean activity in the vicinity of the paekchin ferry crossing site at the ferry site the north koreans had put in an underwater bridge a short distance downstream each night they placed a pontoon bridge across the river and took it up before dawn the next morning carrying parties of 50 civilians guarded by four north korean soldiers crossed the river continuously at night an estimated total of 800-1,000 carriers being used at this crossing site
north of the us 9th infantry and the battles in the naktong bulge and around yongsan the us 23d infantry regiment after daylight of september 1 was in a very precarious position its 1st battalion had been driven from the river positions and isolated 3 miles 4.8 km westward approximately 400 north koreans now overran the regimental command post compelling freeman to withdraw it about 600 yards 550 m there 5 miles 8.0 km northwest of changnyong the us 23rd infantry headquarters and headquarters company miscellaneous regimental units and regimental staff officers checked the north koreans in a 3-hour fight
the north koreans advanced to changnyong itself during the afternoon of september 2 and rok national police withdrew from the town north koreans were in changnyong that evening with his communications broken southward to the 2nd infantry division headquarters and the 9th infantry haynes during the day decided to send a tank patrol down the yongsan road in an effort to re-establish communication c company 72nd tank battalion led its tanks southward they had to fight their way down the road through several roadblocks of the three tanks that started only the lead tank got through to yongsan there it delivered an overlay of task force haynes'positions to bradley
still farther northward in the zone of the us 38th infantry the north koreans were also active after the north korean breakthrough during the night of august 31 keiser had ordered the 2nd battalion 38th infantry to move south and help the 23rd infantry establish a defensive position west of changnyong in attempting to do this the battalion found north korean troops already on the ridges along the road they had penetrated to hill 284 overlooking the 38th infantry command post this hill and hill 209 dominated the rear areas of the regiment at 06 00 september 3 300 north koreans launched an attack from hill 284 against the 38th regiment command post the regimental commander organized a defensive perimeter and requested a bombing strike which was denied him because the enemy target and his defense perimeter were too close to each other but the air force did deliver rocket and strafing strikes
this fight continued until september 5 on that day f company captured hill 284 killing 150 north koreans from the crest he and his men watched as many more north koreans ran into a village below them directed artillery fire destroyed the village among the abandoned north korean materiel on the hill schauer's men found twenty-five american bars and submachine guns a large american radio thirty boxes of unopened american fragmentation and concussion grenades and some american rations
meanwhile during these actions in its rear the 1st battalion 23rd infantry was cut off 3 miles 4.8 km west of the nearest friendly units on september 1 the regiment ordered it to withdraw to the changnyong area at 14 00 a tank-infantry patrol was sent down the road but it reported that an estimated north korean battalion held the mountain pass just eastward of the battalion's defense perimeter upon receiving this report the battalion commander requested permission by radio to remain in his present position and try to obstruct the movement of north korean reinforcements and supplies that evening freeman approved this request and 1st battalion spent three days in the isolated positions during this time c-47 skytrain planes supplied the battalion by airdrops
on the morning of september 1 3rd battalion 38th infantry moved in an attack westward from the 23rd regiment command post near mosan-ni to open the road to the 1st battalion on the second day of the fighting at the pass the relief force broke through the roadblock with the help of air strikes and artillery and tank fire the advanced elements of the battalion joined 1st battalion at 17 00 september 2 that evening north koreans strongly attacked the 3rd battalion 38th infantry on hill 209 north of the road and opposite 1st battalion driving one company from its position
on september 4 haynes changed the boundary between the 38th and 23rd infantry regiments giving the northern part of the 23rd's sector to the 38th infantry thus releasing 1st battalion for movement southward to help the 2nd battalion defend the southern approach to changnyong the 1st battalion 23rd infantry about 1,100 men strong when the attack began was now down to a strength of approximately 600 men the 23rd infantry now made plans to concentrate all its troops on the position held by its 2nd battalion on the pugong-ni-changnyong road the 1st battalion moved there and took a place on the left flank of the 2nd battalion at the same time the regimental command post moved to the rear of this position in this regimental perimeter the 23rd infantry fought a series of hard battles simultaneously it had to send combat patrols to its rear to clear infiltrating north koreans from changnyong and from its supply road
on the morning of september 1 the 1st and 2nd regiments of the nk 9th division in their first offensive of the war stood only a few miles short of yongsan after a successful river crossing and penetration of the american line the 3rd regiment had been left at inch 'on but division commander major general pak kyo sam felt the chances of capturing yongsan were strong
on the morning of september 1 with only the shattered remnants of e company at hand the us 9th infantry regiment us 2nd infantry division had virtually no troops to defend yongsan keiser in this emergency attached the 2nd engineer combat battalion to the regiment the us 72nd tank battalion and the 2nd division reconnaissance company also were assigned positions close to yongsan the regimental commander planned to place the engineers on the chain of low hills that arched around yongsan on the northwest
a company 2nd engineer combat battalion moved to the south side of the yongsan-naktong river road d company of the 2nd engineer battalion was on the north side of the road approximately 2 miles 3.2 km west of yongsan an estimated 300 north korean troops engaged a company in a fire fight m19 gun motor carriages of the 82nd aaa battalion supported the engineers in this action which lasted several hours meanwhile with the approval of general bradley d company moved to the hill immediately south of and overlooking yongsan a platoon of infantry went into position behind it a company was now ordered to fall back to the southeast edge of yongsan on the left flank of d company there a company went into position along the road on its left was c company of the engineer battalion and beyond c company was the 2nd division reconnaissance company the hill occupied by d company was in reality the western tip of a large mountain mass that lay southeast of the town the road to miryang came south out of yongsan bent around the western tip of this mountain and then ran eastward along its southern base in its position d company not only commanded the town but also its exit the road to miryang
north koreans had also approached yongsan from the south the us 2nd division reconnaissance company and tanks of the 72nd tank battalion opposed them in a sharp fight in this action sergeant first class charles w. turner of the reconnaissance company particularly distinguished himself he mounted a tank operated its exposed turret machine gun and directed tank fire which reportedly destroyed seven north korean machine guns turner and this tank came under heavy north korean fire which shot away the tank's periscope and antennae and scored more than 50 hits on it turner although wounded remained on the tank until he was killed that night north korean soldiers crossed the low ground around yongsan and entered the town from the south
at 09 35 september 2 while the north koreans were attempting to destroy the engineer troops at the southern edge of yongsan and clear the road to miryang walker spoke by telephone with major general doyle o. hickey deputy chief of staff far east command in tokyo he described the situation around the perimeter and said the most serious threat was along the boundary between the us 2nd and us 25th infantry divisions he described the location of his reserve forces and his plans for using them he said he had started the 1st provisional marine brigade toward yongsan but had not yet released them for commitment there and he wanted to be sure that general of the army douglas macarthur approved his use of them since he knew that this would interfere with other plans of the far east command walker said he did not think he could restore the 2nd division lines without using them hickey replied that macarthur had the day before approved the use of the us marines if and when walker considered it necessary a few hours after this conversation walker at 13 15 attached the 1st provisional marine brigade to the us 2nd division and ordered a co-ordinated attack by all available elements of the division and the marines with the mission of destroying the north koreans east of the naktong river in the 2nd division sector and of restoring the river line the marines were to be released from 2nd division control as soon as this mission was accomplished
a decision was reached that the marines would attack west at 08 00 on september 3 astride the yongsan-naktong river road the 9th infantry b company of the 72nd tank battalion and d battery of the 82d aaa battalion would attack northwest above the marines and attempt to re-establish contact with the us 23rd infantry the 2nd engineer combat battalion remnants of the 1st battalion 9th infantry and elements of the 72nd tank battalion would attack on the left flank or south of the marines to reestablish contact with the 25th division eighth army now ordered the us 24th infantry division headquarters and the us 19th infantry regiment to move to the susan-ni area 8 miles 13 km south of miryang and 15 miles 24 km east of the confluence of the nam river and the naktong river there it was to prepare to enter the battle in either the 2nd or 25th division zone
the american counteroffensive of september 3–5 west of yongsan according to prisoner statements resulted in one of the bloodiest debacles of the war for a north korean division even though remnants of the nk 9th division supported by the low strength nk 4th division still held obong-ni ridge cloverleaf hill and the intervening ground back to the naktong on september 6 the division's offensive strength had been spent at the end of the american counterattack the nk 9th and 4th divisions were not able to resume the offensive
the nk 2nd division made a new effort against the 23rd infantry's perimeter in the predawn hours of september 8 in an attempt to break through eastward this attack launched at 02 30 and heavily supported with artillery penetrated f company it was apparent that unless f company's position could be restored the entire regimental front would collapse when all its officers became casualties first lieutenant ralph r. robinson adjutant of the 2nd battalion assumed command of the company with north koreans rapidly infiltrating his company's position and gaining its rear robinson in the darkness made his way through them 500 yards 460 m to a company's position there he obtained that company's reserve platoon and brought it back to f company he accomplished the dangerous and difficult task of maneuvering it into the gap in f company's lines in darkness and heavy rain
the attack tapered off with the coming of daylight but that night it resumed the north koreans struck repeatedly at the defense line this time they continued the fighting into the daylight hours of 9 september the air force then concentrated strong air support over the regimental perimeter to aid the ground troops casualties came to the aid stations from the infantry companies in an almost steady stream during the morning all available men from headquarters company and special units were formed into squads and put into the fight at the most critical points at one time the regimental reserve was down to six men when the attack finally ceased shortly after 12 00 the 23rd regiment had an estimated combat efficiency of only 38 percent
this heavy night and day battle cost the nk 2nd division most of its remaining offensive strength the medical officer of the nk 17th regiment 2nd division captured a few days later said that the division evacuated about 300 men nightly to a hospital in pugong-ni and that in the first two weeks of september the 2nd division lost 1,300 killed and 2,500 wounded in the fighting west of changnyong even though its offensive strength was largely spent by september 9 the division continued to harass rear areas around changnyong with infiltrating groups as large as companies patrols daily had to open the main supply road and clear the town
north korean and us troops remained locked in combat along the naktong river for several more days the north koreans'offensive capability was largely destroyed and the us troops resolved to hold their lines barring further attack
the un counterattack at inchon collapsed the north korean line and cut off all their main supply and reinforcement routes on september 19 the un discovered the north koreans had abandoned much of the pusan perimeter during the night and the un units began advancing out of their defensive positions and occupying them most of the north korean units began conducting delaying actions attempting to get as much of their army as possible into north korea the north koreans withdrew from the masan area first the night of september 18–19 after the forces there the remainder of the north korean armies withdrew rapidly to the north the us units rapidly pursued them north passing over the naktong river positions which were no longer of strategic importance
the north korean 2nd and 9th divisions were almost completely destroyed in the battles the 9th division had numbered 9,350 men at the beginning of the offensive on september 1 the 2nd division numbered 6,000 only a few hundred from each division returned to north korea after the fight the majority of the north korean troops had been killed captured or deserted all of nk ii corps was in a similar state and the north korean army exhausted at pusan perimeter and cut off after inchon was on the brink of defeat
by this time the us 2nd infantry division suffered 1,120 killed 2,563 wounded 67 captured and 69 missing during its time at pusan perimeter this included about 180 casualties it suffered during the first battle of naktong bulge the previous month american forces were continually repulsed but able to prevent the north koreans from breaking the pusan perimeter the division had numbered 17,498 on september 1 but was in excellent position to attack despite its casualties the 1st provisional marine brigade suffered 185 killed and around 500 wounded during the battle of pusan perimeter most of which probably occurred at yongsan
of all the north korean attacks along the pusan perimeter the second battle of naktong bulge is seen by historians as the most serious threat it was the battle in which the north koreans made the most substantial gains splitting the us 2nd infantry division in half and briefly capturing yongsan where they were very close to breaching through to the us forces'supply lines and threatening other divisions'rear areas however once again the fatal weakness of the north korean army had cost it victory after an impressive initial success — its communications and supply were not capable of exploiting a breakthrough and of supporting a continuing attack in the face of massive air armor and artillery fire that could be concentrated against its troops at critical points by september 8 the north korean attacks in the area had been repulsed
hed pe also known as hed planet earth and stylized as həd p.e. is an american rock band from huntington beach california formed in 1994 the band performs a style of music which it refers to as g-punk a fusion of punk rock and gangsta rap
after releasing three albums on jive records hed pe left the label to record independently eventually signing with suburban noize records in 2006 since 2006 the band has become known for its involvement in the 9 11 truth movement referencing it in many of their song lyrics and concerts as well as the concept of the album new world orphans to date they have released nine studio albums one live album and two compilation albums
the band was formed by vocalist jared gomes formerly of the clue also known as m.c.u.d. mc underdog and guitarist wes geer who became friends amidst the orange county hardcore punk scene gomes and geer recruited guitarist chizad bassist mawk drummer b.c. vaught and dj product  1969 they named the group hed which stands for higher education the band built a following with their energetic performances at local venues and released the self-financed extended play church of realities legal issues forced hed to change their name adding pe which stood for planet earth
hed pe signed with jive records releasing their self-titled debut album in 1997 in his review of the album allmusic's steve huey wrote there are some slow and or unfocused moments ... but overall its aggression will probably play well with late-'90s metal and punk fans due to the label's contractual terms and the disappointing sales of the album the band found themselves unable to repay the cash advances given to them by jive gomes is quoted as saying we had these romantic visions of the music industry and we thought it would be cool to be a punk band on a rap label so we fulfilled that dream but it was also probably the worst thing that could have happened ... we 've had offers from sony and others that we can 't take because we owe jive so much money
on june 6 2000 hed pe appeared on the tribute album nativity in black ii covering black sabbath's sabbra cadabra hed pe released their second studio album broke on august 22 2000 it peaked at no. 63 on the billboard 200 while its first single bartender peaked at no. 23 on the billboard mainstream rock tracks chart and at no. 27 on the modern rock tracks chart allmusic's jason d. taylor wrote broke may have not found as much success in the competitive mainstream market as some would have liked and even despite its distinct departure from the group's debut it is an album that shows more vision than other rap-tinged rock albums to come out in 2000 the most negative response to the album came from critics who viewed its lyrics as misogynistic
on october 27 2000 gomes was arrested for possession of marijuana while the band was performing in waterbury connecticut he was released on a us 1,500 bond in 2001 hed pe performed on the ozzfest tour alongside bands such as korn static-x and system of a down a music video for killing time the second single from broke was produced in promotion of the film 3000 miles to graceland which featured the song on its soundtrack

in 2006 hed pe signed with suburban noize records recording their fifth studio album back 2 base x. the album was intended as a return to the basics of rock music and did not rely as heavily on studio enhancement as previous releases the album was released on june 6 2006 the same day as the best of həd planet earth a compilation album produced by jive records without the band's authorization or consent back 2 base x peaked at no. 12 on the independent albums chart and at no. 154 on the billboard 200 allmusic's rob theakston wrote that back 2 base x suffers from the same problems as amerika it tries to be conceptual in thought à la tool and vicious in its political commentary à la fugazi or system of a down but somehow falls short by sounding like an angry stoner on a soapbox it won 't win any new fans but existing fans of hed pe's work won 't be turning their backs away from the band in anger anytime soon either

an ironclad is a steam-propelled warship protected by iron or steel armor plates used in the early part of the second half of the 19th century the ironclad was developed as a result of the vulnerability of wooden warships to explosive or incendiary shells the first ironclad battleship gloire was launched by the french navy in november 1859 the british admiralty had been considering armored warships since 1856 and prepared a draft design for an armored corvette in 1857 in early 1859 the royal navy started building two iron-hulled armored frigates and by 1861 had made the decision to move to an all-armored battle fleet after the first clashes of ironclads both with wooden ships and with one another took place in 1862 during the american civil war it became clear that the ironclad had replaced the unarmored ship of the line as the most powerful warship afloat this type of ship would come to be very successful in the american civil war
ironclads were designed for several roles including as high seas battleships coastal defense ships and long-range cruisers the rapid evolution of warship design in the late 19th century transformed the ironclad from a wooden-hulled vessel that carried sails to supplement its steam engines into the steel-built turreted battleships and cruisers familiar in the 20th century this change was pushed forward by the development of heavier naval guns the ironclads of the 1880s carried some of the heaviest guns ever mounted at sea more sophisticated steam engines and advances in metallurgy which made steel shipbuilding possible
the quick pace of change meant that many ships were obsolete as soon as they were finished and that naval tactics were in a state of flux many ironclads were built to make use of the ram or the torpedo which a number of naval designers considered the important weapons of naval combat there is no clear end to the ironclad period but towards the end of the 1890s the term ironclad dropped out of use new ships were increasingly constructed to a standard pattern and designated battleships or armored cruisers
the ironclad became technically feasible and tactically necessary because of developments in shipbuilding in the first half of the 19th century according to naval historian j. richard hill the ironclad had three chief characteristics a metal-skinned hull steam propulsion and a main armament of guns capable of firing explosive shells it is only when all three characteristics are present that a fighting ship can properly be called an ironclad each of these developments was introduced separately in the decade before the first ironclads
in the 18th and early 19th centuries fleets had relied on two types of major warship the ship of the line and the frigate the first major change to these types was the introduction of steam power for propulsion while paddle steamer warships had been used from the 1830s onwards steam propulsion only became suitable for major warships after the adoption of the screw propeller in the 1840s
steam-powered screw frigates were built in the mid-1840s and at the end of the decade the french navy introduced steam power to its line of battle the desire for change came from the ambition of napoleon iii to gain greater influence in europe which required a challenge to the british at sea the first purpose-built steam battleship was the 90-gun napoléon in 1850 napoléon was armed as a conventional ship-of-the-line but her steam engines could give her a speed of 12 knots 22 km h regardless of the wind conditions a potentially decisive advantage in a naval engagement
the introduction of the steam ship-of-the-line led to a building competition between france and britain eight sister ships to napoléon were built in france over a period of ten years but the united kingdom soon managed to take the lead in production altogether france built ten new wooden steam battleships and converted 28 from older ships of the line while the united kingdom built 18 and converted 41
the era of the wooden steam ship-of-the-line was brief because of new more powerful naval guns in the 1820s and 1830s warships began to mount increasingly heavy guns replacing 18- and 24-pounder guns with 32-pounders on sailing ships-of-the-line and introducing 68-pounders on steamers then the first shell guns firing explosive shells were introduced following their development by the french général henri-joseph paixhans and by the 1840s were part of the standard armament for naval powers including the french navy royal navy imperial russian navy and united states navy it is often held that the power of explosive shells to smash wooden hulls as demonstrated by the russian destruction of an ottoman squadron at the battle of sinop spelled the end of the wooden-hulled warship the more practical threat to wooden ships was from conventional cannon firing red-hot shot which could lodge in the hull of a wooden ship and cause a fire or ammunition explosion some navies even experimented with hollow shot filled with molten metal for extra incendiary power
the use of iron instead of wood as the primary material of ships'hulls began in the 1830s the first warship with an iron hull was the gunboat nemesis built by laird for the east india company in 1839 there followed also from laird the first full-blown warships with metal hulls the 1842 steam frigates guadelupe and montezuma for the mexican navy but a thin iron skin while not being susceptible to fire or lethal splintering like wood was not the same thing as providing iron armor calculated to stop enemy gunfire
following the demonstration of the power of explosive shells against wooden ships at the battle of sinop and fearing that his own ships would be vulnerable to the paixhans guns of russian fortifications in the crimean war emperor napoleon iii ordered the development of light-draft floating batteries equipped with heavy guns and protected by heavy armor experiments made during the first half of 1854 proved highly satisfactory and on 17 july 1854 the french communicated to the british government that a solution had been found to make gun-proof vessels and that plans would be communicated after tests in september 1854 the british admiralty agreed to build five armoured floating batteries on the french plans establishing the important thames and millwall iron works within the docks
the french floating batteries were deployed in 1855 as a supplement to the wooden steam battle fleet in the crimean war the role of the battery was to assist unarmored mortar and gunboats bombarding shore fortifications the french used three of their ironclad batteries lave tonnante and dévastation in 1855 against the defenses at the battle of kinburn on the black sea where they were effective against russian shore defences they would later be used again during the italian war in the adriatic in 1859 the british floating batteries glatton and meteor arrived too late to participate to the action at kinburn the british planned to use theirs in the baltic sea against the well-fortified naval base at kronstadt
the batteries have a claim to the title of the first ironclad warships but they were capable of only 4 knots 7 km h under their own power they operated under their own power at the battle of kinburn but had to be towed for long range transit they were also arguably marginal to the work of the navy the brief success of the floating ironclad batteries convinced france to begin work on armored warships for their battlefleet
by the end of the 1850s it was clear that france was unable to match british building of steam warships and to regain the strategic initiative a dramatic change was required the result was the first ocean-going ironclad the gloire begun in 1857 and launched in 1859
gloire's wooden hull was modelled on that of a steam ship of the line reduced to one deck sheathed in iron plates 4.5 inches 110 mm thick she was propelled by a steam engine driving a single screw propeller for a speed of 13 knots 24 km h she was armed with thirty-six 6.4-inch 160 mm rifled guns france proceeded to construct 16 ironclad warships including two more sister ships to gloire and the only two-decked broadside ironclads ever built magenta and solférino
the royal navy had not been keen to sacrifice its advantage in steam ships of the line but was determined that the first british ironclad would outmatch the french ships in every respect particularly speed a fast ship would have the advantage of being able to choose a range of engagement which could make her invulnerable to enemy fire the british specification was more a large powerful frigate than a ship-of-the-line the requirement for speed meant a very long vessel which had to be built from iron the result was the construction of two warrior-class ironclads hms warrior and hms black prince the ships had a successful design though there were necessarily compromises between'sea-keeping', strategic range and armour protection their weapons were more effective than that of gloire and with the largest set of steam engines yet fitted to a ship they could steam at 14.3 knots 26.5 km h yet the gloire and her sisters had full iron-armour protection along the waterline and the battery itself warrior and black prince but also the smaller defence and resistance were obliged to concentrate their armour in a central'citadel'or'armoured box', leaving many main deck guns and the fore and aft sections of the vessel unprotected the use of iron in the construction of warrior also came with some drawbacks iron hulls required more regular and intensive repairs than wooden hulls and iron was more susceptible to fouling by marine life
by 1862 navies across europe had adopted ironclads britain and france each had sixteen either completed or under construction though the british vessels were larger austria italy russia and spain were also building ironclads however the first battles using the new ironclad ships involved neither britain nor france and involved ships markedly different from the broadside-firing masted designs of gloire and warrior the use of ironclads by both sides in the american civil war and the clash of the italian and austrian fleets at the battle of lissa had an important influence on the development of ironclad design
the first use of ironclads in action came in the u.s. civil war the u.s. navy at the time the war broke out had no ironclads its most powerful ships being six steam-powered unarmoured frigates since the bulk of the navy remained loyal to the union the confederacy sought to gain advantage in the naval conflict by acquiring modern armored ships in may 1861 the confederate congress voted that 2 million be appropriated for the purchase of ironclads from overseas and in july and august 1861 the confederacy started work on construction and converting wooden ships
on 12 october 1861 the css manassas became the first ironclad to enter combat when she fought union warships on the mississippi during the battle of the head of passes she had been converted from a commercial vessel in new orleans for river and coastal fighting in february 1862 the larger css virginia joined the confederate navy having been rebuilt at norfolk constructed on the hull of uss merrimack virginia originally was a conventional warship made of wood but she was converted into an iron-covered casemate ironclad gunship when she entered the confederate navy by this time the union had completed seven ironclad gunboats of the city class and was about to complete the uss monitor an innovative design proposed by the swedish inventor john ericsson the union was also building a large armored frigate the uss new ironsides and the smaller uss galena
the first battle between ironclads happened on 9 march 1862 as the armored monitor was deployed to protect the union's wooden fleet from the ironclad ram virginia and other confederate warships in this engagement the second day of the battle of hampton roads the two ironclads repeatedly tried to ram one another while shells bounced off their armor the battle attracted attention worldwide making it clear that the wooden warship was now out of date with the ironclads destroying them easily
the civil war saw more ironclads built by both sides and they played an increasing role in the naval war alongside the unarmored warships commerce raiders and blockade runners the union built a large fleet of fifty monitors modeled on their namesake the confederacy built ships designed as smaller versions of the virginia many of which saw action but their attempts to buy ironclads overseas were frustrated as european nations confiscated ships being built for the confederacy — especially in russia the only country to openly support the union through the war only css stonewall was completed and she arrived in american waters just in time for the end of the war
through the remainder of the war ironclads saw action in the union's attacks on confederate ports seven union monitors including uss montauk as well as two other ironclads the ironclad frigate new ironsides and a light-draft uss keokuk participated in the failed attack on charleston one was sunk two small ironclads css palmetto state and css chicora participated in the defence of the harbor for the later attack at mobile bay the union assembled four monitors as well as 11 wooden ships facing the css tennessee the confederacy's most powerful ironclad and the gunboats css morgan css gaines css selma
on the western front the union built a formidable force of river ironclads beginning with several converted riverboats and then contracting engineer james eads of st. louis missouri to build the city-class ironclads these excellent ships were built with twin engines and a central paddle wheel all protected by an armored casement they had a shallow draft allowing them to journey up smaller tributaries and were very well suited for river operations eads also produced monitors for use on the rivers the first two of which differed from the ocean-going monitors in that they contained a paddle wheel the uss neosho and uss osage
arguably eads vessels were some of the better ironclads of the western flotilla but there were a number of other vessels that served valiantly with the fleet all were of varying design some more successful than others and some were similar to standard riverboats but with armored side-mounted paddle wheels all were armed with various smoothbore and some rifled guns if nothing else the experience of the american civil war and its wild variety of competing ironclad designs some more successful or disastrous than others confirmed the emerging trade-off or compromises required in applying the latest technological advances in iron armour manufacture ship construction and gun design — to name a few — also going on in europe there was no such thing as a'perfect'ironclad which could be invincible in every possible encounter ship duels standing up to forts brown blue-water operations
the union ironclads played an important role in the mississippi and tributaries by providing tremendous fire upon confederate forts installations and vessels with relative impunity to enemy fire they were not as heavily armored as the ocean-going monitors of the union but they were adequate for their intended use more western flotilla union ironclads were sunk by torpedoes mines than by enemy fire and the most damaging fire for the union ironclads was from shore installations not confederate vessels
the first fleet battle and the first ocean battle involving ironclad warships was the battle of lissa in 1866 waged between the austrian and italian navies the battle pitted combined fleets of wooden frigates and corvettes and ironclad warships on both sides in the largest naval battle between the battles of navarino and tsushima
the italian fleet consisted of 12 ironclads and a similar number of wooden warships escorting transports which carried troops intending to land on the adriatic island of lissa among the italian ironclads were seven broadside ironclad frigates four smaller ironclads and the newly built affondatore — a double-turretted ram opposing them the austrian navy had seven ironclad frigates
the austrians believed their ships to have less effective guns than their enemy so decided to engage the italians at close range and ram them the austrian fleet formed into an arrowhead formation with the ironclads in the first line charging at the italian ironclad squadron in the melée which followed both sides were frustrated by the lack of damage inflicted by guns and by the difficulty of ramming — nonetheless the effective ramming attack being made by the austrian flagship against the italian attracted great attention in following years
the superior italian fleet lost its two ironclads re d 'italia and palestro while the austrian unarmoured screw two-decker sms kaiser remarkably survived close actions with four italian ironclads the battle ensured the popularity of the ram as a weapon in european ironclads for many years and the victory won by austria established it as the predominant naval power in the adriatic
the battles of the american civil war and at lissa were very influential on the designs and tactics of the ironclad fleets that followed in particular it taught a generation of naval officers the misleading lesson that ramming was the best way to sink enemy ironclads
the adoption of iron armor meant that the traditional naval armament of dozens of light cannon became useless since their shot would bounce off an armored hull to penetrate armor increasingly heavy guns were mounted on ships nevertheless the view that ramming was the only way to sink an ironclad became widespread the increasing size and weight of guns also meant a movement away from the ships mounting many guns broadside in the manner of a ship-of-the-line towards a handful of guns in turrets for all-round fire
from the 1860s to the 1880s many naval designers believed that the development of the ironclad meant that the ram was again the most important weapon in naval warfare with steam power freeing ships from the wind and armor making them invulnerable to shellfire the ram seemed to offer the opportunity to strike a decisive blow
the scant damage inflicted by the guns of monitor and virginia at battle of hampton roads and the spectacular but lucky success of the austrian flagship sms erzherzog ferdinand max sinking the italian re d 'italia at lissa gave strength to the ramming craze from the early 1870s to early 1880s most british naval officers thought that guns were about to be replaced as the main naval armament by the ram those who noted the tiny number of ships that had actually been sunk by ramming struggled to be heard
the revival of ramming had a significant effect on naval tactics since the 17th century the predominant tactic of naval warfare had been the line of battle where a fleet formed a long line to give it the best fire from its broadside guns this tactic was totally unsuited to ramming and the ram threw fleet tactics into disarray the question of how an ironclad fleet should deploy in battle to make best use of the ram was never tested in battle and if it had been combat might have shown that rams could only be used against ships which were already stopped dead in the water
the ram finally fell out of favour in the 1880s as the same effect could be achieved with a torpedo with less vulnerability to quick-firing guns
the armament of ironclads tended to become concentrated in a small number of powerful guns capable of penetrating the armor of enemy ships at range calibre and weight of guns increased markedly to achieve greater penetration throughout the ironclad era navies also grappled with the complexities of rifled versus smoothbore guns and breech-loading versus muzzle-loading
hms warrior carried a mixture of 110-pounder 7 inch 180 mm breech-loading rifles and more traditional 68-pounder smoothbore guns warrior highlighted the challenges of picking the right armament the breech-loaders she carried designed by sir william armstrong were intended to be the next generation of heavy armament for the royal navy but were shortly withdrawn from service
breech-loading guns seemed to offer important advantages a breech-loader could be reloaded without moving the gun a lengthy process particularly if the gun then needed to be re-aimed the warrior's armstrong guns also had the virtue of being lighter than an equivalent smoothbore and because of their rifling more accurate nonetheless the design was rejected because of problems which plagued breech-loaders for decades
the weakness of the breech-loader was the obvious problem of sealing the breech all guns are powered by the explosive conversion of gunpowder into gas this explosion propels the shot or shell out of the front of the gun but also imposes great stresses on the gun-barrel if the breech — which experiences some of the greatest forces in the gun — is not entirely secure then there is a risk that either gas will discharge through the breech or that the breech will break this in turn reduces the muzzle velocity of the weapon and can also endanger the gun crew the warrior's armstrong guns suffered from both problems the shells were unable to penetrate the 4.5 in 118 mm armor of gloire while sometimes the screw which closed the breech flew backwards out of the gun on firing similar problems were experienced with the breech-loading guns which became standard in the french and german navies
these problems influenced the british to equip ships with muzzle-loading weapons of increasing power until the 1880s after a brief introduction of 100-pounder or 9.5-inch 240 mm smoothbore somerset gun which weighed 6.5 tons 6.6 t the admiralty introduced 7-inch 178 mm rifled guns weighing 7 tons these were followed by a series of increasingly mammoth weapons — guns weighing 12 25 25 38 and finally 81 tons with calibre increasing from 8-inch 203 mm to 16-inch 406 mm
the decision to retain muzzle-loaders until the 1880s has been criticised by historians however at least until the late 1870s the british muzzle-loaders had superior performance in terms of both range and rate of fire than the french and prussian breech-loaders which suffered from the same problems as had the first armstrong guns
from 1875 onwards the balance between breech- and muzzle-loading changed captain de bange invented a method of reliably sealing a breech adopted by the french in 1873 just as compellingly the growing size of naval guns made muzzle-loading much more complicated with guns of such size there was no prospect of hauling in the gun for re-loading or even re-loading by hand and complicated hydraulic systems were required for re-loading the gun outside the turret without exposing the crew to enemy fire in 1882 the 81-ton 16-inch 406 mm guns of hms inflexible fired only once every 11 minutes while bombarding alexandria during the urabi revolt the 100-ton 450 mm 17.72 inch guns of caio duilio could each fire a round every 15 minutes
in the royal navy the switch to breech-loaders was finally made in 1879 as well as the significant advantages in terms of performance opinion was swayed by an explosion on board hms thunderer caused by a gun being double-loaded a problem which could only happen with a muzzle-loading gun
the calibre and weight of guns could only increase so far the larger the gun the slower it would be to load the greater the stresses on the ship's hull and the less the stability of the ship the size of the gun peaked in the 1880s with some of the heaviest calibres of gun ever used at sea hms benbow carried two 16.25-inch 413 mm breech-loading guns each weighing 110 tons — no british battleship would ever carry guns as large the italian 450 mm 17.72 inch guns would be larger than any gun fitted to a battleship until the 18.1-inch 460 mm armament of the japanese yamato class of world war ii one consideration which became more acute was that even from the original armstrong models following the crimean war range and hitting power far exceeded simple accuracy especially at sea where the slightest roll or pitch of the vessel as'floating weapons-platform'could negate the advantage of rifling american ordnance experts accordingly preferred smoothbore monsters whose round shot could at least'skip'along the surface of the water actual effective combat ranges they had learned during the civil war were comparable to those in the age of sail — though a vessel could now be smashed to pieces in only a few rounds smoke and the general chaos of battle only added to the problem as a result many naval engagements in the'age of the ironclad'were still fought at ranges within easy eyesight of their targets and well below the maximum reach of their ships'guns
another method of increasing firepower was to vary the projectile fired or the nature of the propellant early ironclads used black powder which expanded rapidly after combustion this meant cannons had relatively short barrels to prevent the barrel itself slowing the shell the sharpness of the black powder explosion also meant that guns were subjected to extreme stress one important step was to press the powder into pellets allowing a slower more controlled explosion and a longer barrel a further step forward was the introduction of chemically different brown powder which combusted more slowly again it also put less stress on the insides of the barrel allowing guns to last longer and to be manufactured to tighter tolerances
the development of smokeless powder based on nitroglycerine or nitrocellulose by the french inventor paul vielle in 1884 was a further step allowing smaller charges of propellant with longer barrels the guns of the pre-dreadnought battleships of the 1890s tended to be smaller in calibre compared to the ships of the 1880s most often 12 in 305 mm but progressively grew in length of barrel making use of improved propellants to gain greater muzzle velocity
the nature of the projectiles also changed during the ironclad period initially the best armor-piercing projectile was a solid cast-iron shot later shot of chilled iron a harder iron alloy gave better armor-piercing qualities eventually the armor-piercing shell was developed
the first british french and russian ironclads in a logical development of warship design from the long preceding era of wooden ships of the line carried their weapons in a single line along their sides and so were called broadside ironclads both gloire and hms warrior were examples of this type because their armor was so heavy they could only carry a single row of guns along the main deck on each side rather than a row on each deck
a significant number of broadside ironclads were built in the 1860s principally in britain and france but in smaller numbers by other powers including italy austria russia and the united states the advantages of mounting guns on both broadsides was that the ship could engage more than one adversary at a time and the rigging did not impede the field of fire
broadside armament also had disadvantages which became more serious as ironclad technology developed heavier guns to penetrate ever-thicker armor meant that fewer guns could be carried furthermore the adoption of ramming as an important tactic meant the need for ahead and all-round fire these problems led to broadside designs being superseded by designs that gave greater all-round fire which included central-battery turret and barbette designs
there were two main design alternatives to the broadside in one design the guns were placed in an armoured casemate amidships this arrangement was called the'box-battery'or'centre-battery'. in the other the guns could be placed on a rotating platform to give them a broad field of fire when fully armored this arrangement was called a turret and when partially armored or unarmored a barbette
the centre-battery was the simpler and during the 1860s and 1870s the more popular method concentrating guns amidships meant the ship could be shorter and handier than a broadside type the first full-scale centre-battery ship was hms bellerophon of 1865 the french laid down centre-battery ironclads in 1865 which were not completed until 1870 centre-battery ships often but not always had a recessed freeboard enabling some of their guns to fire directly ahead
the turret was first used in naval combat on the uss monitor in 1862 with a type of turret designed by the swedish engineer john ericsson a competing turret design was proposed by the british inventor cowper coles with a prototype of this installed on hms trusty in 1861 for testing and evaluation purposes ericsson's turret turned on a central spindle and coles's turned on a ring of bearings turrets offered the maximum arc of fire from the guns but there were significant problems with their use in the 1860s the fire arc of a turret would be considerably limited by masts and rigging so they were unsuited to use on the earlier ocean-going ironclads the second problem was that turrets were extremely heavy ericsson was able to offer the heaviest possible turret guns and armour protection by deliberately designing a ship with very low freeboard the weight thus saved from having a high broadside above the waterline was diverted to actual guns and armour low freeboard however also meant a smaller hull and therefore a smaller capacity for coal storage — and therefore range of the vessel in many respects the turreted low-freeboard monitor and the broadside sailer hms warrior represented two opposite extremes in what an'ironclad'was all about the most dramatic attempt to compromise these two extremes or'squaring this circle', was designed by captain cowper phipps coles hms captain a dangerously low freeboard turret ship which nevertheless carried a full rig of sail and which subsequently capsized not long after her launch in 1870 her half-sister hms monarch was restricted to firing from her turrets only on the port and starboard beams the third royal navy ship to combine turrets and masts was hms inflexible of 1876 which carried two turrets on either side of the centre-line allowing both to fire fore aft and broadside
a lighter alternative to the turret particularly popular with the french navy was the barbette these were fixed armored towers which held a gun on a turntable the crew was sheltered from direct fire but vulnerable to plunging fire for instance from shore emplacements the barbette was lighter than the turret needing less machinery and no roof armor — though nevertheless some barbettes were stripped of their armor plate to reduce the top-weight of their ships the barbette became widely adopted in the 1880s and with the addition of an armored'gun-house', transformed into the turrets of the pre-dreadnought battleships
the ironclad age saw the development of explosive torpedoes as naval weapons which helped complicate the design and tactics of ironclad fleets the first torpedoes were static mines used extensively in the american civil war that conflict also saw the development of the spar torpedo an explosive charge pushed against the hull of a warship by a small boat for the first time a large warship faced a serious threat from a smaller one — and given the relative inefficiency of shellfire against ironclads the threat from the spar torpedo was taken seriously the u.s. navy converted four of its monitors to become turretless armored spar-torpedo vessels while under construction in 1864–5 but these vessels never saw action another proposal the towed or'harvey'torpedo involved an explosive on a line or outrigger either to deter a ship from ramming or to make a torpedo attack by a boat less suicidal
a more practical and influential weapon was the self-propelled or whitehead torpedo invented in 1868 and deployed in the 1870s the whitehead torpedo formed part of the armament of ironclads of the 1880s like hms inflexible and the italian caio duilio and enrico dandolo the ironclad's vulnerability to the torpedo was a key part of the critique of armored warships made by the jeune ecole school of naval thought it appeared that any ship armored enough to prevent destruction by gunfire would be slow enough to be easily caught by torpedo in practice however the jeune ecole was only briefly influential and the torpedo formed part of the confusing mixture of weapons possessed by ironclads
the first ironclads were built on wooden or iron hulls and protected by wrought iron armor backed by thick wooden planking ironclads were still being built with wooden hulls into the 1870s
using iron construction for warships offered advantages for the engineering of the hull however unarmored iron had many military disadvantages and offered technical problems which kept wooden hulls in use for many years particularly for long-range cruising warships
iron ships had first been proposed for military use in the 1820s in the 1830s and 1840s france britain and the united states had all experimented with iron-hulled but unarmored gunboats and frigates however the iron-hulled frigate was abandoned by the end of the 1840s because iron hulls were more vulnerable to solid shot iron was more brittle than wood and iron frames more likely to fall out of shape than wood
the unsuitability of unarmored iron for warship hulls meant that iron was only adopted as a building material for battleships when protected by armor however iron gave the naval architect many advantages iron allowed larger ships and more flexible design for instance the use of watertight bulkheads on the lower decks warrior built of iron was longer and faster than the wooden-hulled gloire iron could be produced to order and used immediately in contrast to the need to give wood a long period of seasoning and given the large quantities of wood required to build a steam warship and the falling cost of iron iron hulls were increasingly cost-effective the main reason for the french use of wooden hulls for the ironclad fleet built in the 1860s was that the french iron industry could not supply enough and the main reason why britain built its handful of wooden-hulled ironclads was to make best use of hulls already started and wood already bought
wooden hulls continued to be used for long-range and smaller ironclads because iron nevertheless had a significant disadvantage iron hulls suffered quick fouling by marine life slowing the ships down — manageable for a european battlefleet close to dry docks but a difficulty for long-range ships the only solution was to sheath the iron hull first in wood and then in copper a laborious and expensive process which made wooden construction remain attractive iron and wood were to some extent interchangeable the japanese kongō and hiei ordered in 1875 were sister-ships but one was built of iron and the other of composite construction
after 1872 steel started to be introduced as a material for construction compared to iron steel allows for greater structural strength for a lower weight the french navy led the way with the use of steel in its fleet starting with the redoutable laid down in 1873 and launched in 1876 redoutable nonetheless had wrought iron armor plate and part of her exterior hull was iron rather than steel
even though britain led the world in steel production the royal navy was slow to adopt steel warships the bessemer process for steel manufacture produced too many imperfections for large-scale use on ships french manufacturers used the siemens-martin process to produce adequate steel but british technology lagged behind the first all-steel warships built by the royal navy were the dispatch vessels iris and mercury laid down in 1875 and 1876
iron-built ships used wood as part of their protection scheme hms warrior was protected by 4.5 in 114 mm of wrought iron backed by 15 in 381 mm of teak the strongest shipbuilding wood the wood played two roles preventing spalling and also preventing the shock of a hit damaging the structure of the ship later wood and iron were combined in'sandwich'armor for instance in hms inflexible
steel was also an obvious material for armor it was tested in the 1860s but the steel of the time was too brittle and disintegrated when struck by shells steel became practical to use when a way was found to fuse steel onto wrought iron plates giving a form of compound armor this compound armor was used by the british in ships built from the late 1870s first for turret armor starting with hms inflexible and then for all armor starting with hms colossus of 1882 the french and german navies adopted the innovation almost immediately with licenses being given for the use of the'wilson system'of producing fused armor
the first ironclads to have all-steel armor were the italian caio duilio and enrico dandolo though the ships were laid down in 1873 their armor was not purchased from france until 1877 the french navy decided in 1880 to adopt compound armor for its fleet but found it limited in supply so from 1884 the french navy was using steel armor britain stuck to compound armor until 1889
the ultimate ironclad armor was case hardened nickel-steel in 1890 the u.s. navy tested steel armor hardened by the harvey process and found it superior to compound armor for several years'harvey steel'was the state of the art produced in the u.s. france germany britain austria and italy in 1894 the german firm krupp developed gas cementing which further hardened steel armor the german kaiser friedrich iii laid down in 1895 was the first ship to benefit from the new'krupp armor'and the new armor was quickly adopted the royal navy using it from hms canopus laid down in 1896 by 1901 almost all new battleships used krupp armor though the u.s. continued to use harvey armor alongside until the end of the decade
the equivalent strengths of the different armor plates was as follows 15 in 381 mm of wrought iron was equivalent to 12 in 305 mm of either plain steel or compound iron and steel armor and to 7.75 in 197 mm of harvey armor or 5.75 in 146 mm of krupp armor
ironclad construction also prefigured the later debate in battleship design between tapering and'all-or-nothing'armour design warrior was only semi-armoured and could have been disabled by hits on the bow and stern as the thickness of armor grew to protect ships from the increasingly heavy guns the area of the ship which could be fully protected diminished inflexible's armor protection was largely limited to the central citadel amidships protecting boilers and engines turrets and magazines and little else an ingenious arrangement of cork-filled compartments and watertight bulkheads was intended to keep her stable and afloat in the event of heavy damage to her un-armored sections
the first ocean-going ironclads carried masts and sails like their wooden predecessors and these features were only gradually abandoned early steam engines were inefficient the wooden steam fleet of the royal navy could only carry 5 to 9 days coal and the situation was similar with the early ironclads warrior also illustrates two design features which aided hybrid propulsion she had retractable screws to reduce drag while under sail though in practice the steam engine was run at a low throttle and a telescopic funnel which could be folded down to the deck level
ships designed for coastal warfare like the floating batteries of the crimea or uss monitor and her sisters dispensed with masts from the beginning the british hms devastation started in 1869 was the first large ocean-going ironclad to dispense with masts her principal role was for combat in the english channel and other european waters and while her coal supplies gave her enough range to cross the atlantic she would have had little endurance on the other side of the ocean the devastation and the similar ships commissioned by the british and russian navies in the 1870s were the exception rather than the rule most ironclads of the 1870s retained masts and only the italian navy which during that decade was focused on short-range operations in the adriatic built consistently mastless ironclads
during the 1860s steam engines improved with the adoption of double-expansion steam engines which used 30–40 less coal than earlier models the royal navy decided to switch to the double-expansion engine in 1871 and by 1875 they were widespread however this development alone was not enough to herald the end of the mast whether this was due to a conservative desire to retain sails or was a rational response to the operational and strategic situation is a matter of debate a steam-only fleet would require a network of coaling stations worldwide which would need to be fortified at great expense to stop them falling into enemy hands just as significantly because of unsolved problems with the technology of the boilers which provided steam for the engines the performance of double-expansion engines was rarely as good in practice as it was in theory
during the 1870s the distinction grew between'first-class ironclads'or'battleships'on the one hand and'cruising ironclads'designed for long-range work on the other the demands on first-class ironclads for very heavy armor and armament meant increasing displacement which reduced speed under sail and the fashion for turrets and barbettes made a sailing rig increasingly inconvenient hms inflexible launched in 1876 but not commissioned until 1881 was the last british battleship to carry masts and these were widely seen as a mistake the start of the 1880s saw the end of sailing rig on ironclad battleships
sails persisted on'cruising ironclads'for much longer during the 1860s the french navy had produced the alma and la galissonnière classes as small long-range ironclads as overseas cruisers and the british had responded with ships like hms swiftsure of 1870 the russian ship general-admiral laid down in 1870 and completed in 1875 was a model of a fast long-range ironclad which was likely to be able to outrun and outfight ships like swiftsure even the later hms shannon often described as the first british armored cruiser would have been too slow to outrun general-admiral while shannon was the last british ship with a retractable propellor later armored cruisers of the 1870s retained sailing rig sacrificing speed under steam in consequence it took until 1881 for the royal navy to lay down a long-range armored warship capable of catching enemy commerce raiders hms warspite which was completed in 1888 while sailing rigs were obsolescent for all purposes by the end of the 1880s rigged ships were in service until the early years of the 20th century
the final evolution of ironclad propulsion was the adoption of the triple-expansion steam engine a further refinement which was first adopted in hms sans pareil laid down in 1885 and commissioned in 1891 many ships also used a forced draught to get additional power from their engines and this system was widely used until the introduction of the steam turbine in the mid-1900s decade
while ironclads spread rapidly in navies worldwide there were few pitched naval battles involving ironclads most european nations settled differences on land and the royal navy struggled to maintain a deterrent parity with at least france while providing suitable protection to britain's commerce and colonial outposts worldwide ironclads remained for the british royal navy a matter of defending the british isles first and projecting power abroad second those naval engagements of the latter half of the 19th-century which involved ironclads normally involved colonial actions or clashes between second-rate naval powers but these encounters were often enough to convince british policy-makers of the increasing hazards of strictly naval foreign intervention from hampton roads in the american civil war to the hardening combined defences of naval arsenals such as kronstadt and cherbourg
there were many types of ironclads
seagoing ships intended to stand in the line of battle the precursors of the battleship
coastal service and riverine vessels including'floating batteries'and'monitors'
vessels intended for commerce raiding or protection of commerce called'armoured cruisers'
the united kingdom possessed the largest navy in the world for the whole of the ironclad period the royal navy was the second to adopt ironclad warships and it applied them worldwide in their whole range of roles in the age of sail the british strategy for war depended on the royal navy mounting a blockade of the ports of the enemy because of the limited endurance of steamships this was no longer possible so the british at times considered the risk-laden plan of engaging an enemy fleet in harbor as soon as war broke out to this end the royal navy developed a series of'coast-defence battleships', starting with the devastation class these'breastwork monitors'were markedly different from the other high-seas ironclads of the period and were an important precursor of the modern battleship as long-range monitors they could reach bermuda unescorted for example however they were still armed with only four heavy guns and were as vulnerable to mines and obstructions and enemy monitors as the original monitors of the union navy proved to be during the civil war the british prepared for an overwhelming mortar bombardment of kronstadt by the close of the crimean war but never considered running the smoke-ridden shallow-water gauntlet straight to st. petersburg with ironclads likewise monitors proved acutely unable to'overwhelm'enemy fortifications single-handed during the american conflict though their low-profile and heavy armour protection made them ideal for running gauntlets mines and obstructions however negated these advantages — a problem the british admiralty frequently acknowledged but never countered throughout the period the british never laid down enough devastation-class'battleships'to instantly overwhelm cherbourg kronstadt or even new york city with gunfire although throughout the 1860s and 1870s the royal navy was still in many respects superior to its potential rivals by the early 1880s widespread concern about the threat from france and germany culminated in the naval defence act which promulgated the idea of a'two-power standard', that britain should possess as many ships as the next two navies combined this standard provoked aggressive shipbuilding in the 1880s and 1890s
british ships did not participate in any major wars in the ironclad period the royal navy's ironclads only saw action as part of colonial battles or one-sided engagements like the bombardment of alexandria in 1882 defending british interests against ahmed'urabi's egyptian revolt a british fleet opened fire on the fortifications around the port of alexandria a mixture of centre-battery and turret ships bombarded egyptian positions for most of a day forcing the egyptians to retreat return fire from egyptian guns was heavy at first but inflicted little damage killing only five british sailors few egyptian guns were actually dismounted on the other hand and the fortifications themselves were typically left intact had the egyptians actually utilised the heavy mortars that were at their disposal they might have quickly turned the tide for the attacking british ironclads found it easy for accuracy's sake to simply anchor whilst firing — perfect targets for high-angle fire upon their thinly armoured topdecks
the french navy built the first ironclad to try to gain a strategic advantage over the british but were consistently out-built by the british despite taking the lead with a number of innovations like breech-loading weapons and steel construction the french navy could never match the size of the royal navy in the 1870s the construction of ironclads ceased for a while in france as the jeune ecole school of naval thought took prominence suggesting that torpedo boats and unarmored cruisers would be the future of warships like the british the french navy saw little action with its ironclads the french blockade of germany in the franco-prussian war was ineffective as the war was settled entirely on land
russia built a number of ironclads generally copies of british or french designs nonetheless there were real innovations from russia the first true type of ironclad armored cruiser the general-admiral of the 1870s and a set of remarkably badly designed circular battleships referred to as'popovkas'( for admiral popov who conceived the design the russian navy pioneered the wide-scale use of torpedo boats during the russo-turkish war of 1877–1878 mainly out of necessity because of the superior numbers and quality of ironclads used by the turkish navy russia expanded her navy in the 1880s and 1890s with modern armored cruisers and battleships but the ships were manned by inexperienced crews and politically appointed leadership which enhanced their defeat in the battle of tsushima on 27 may 1905
the u.s. navy ended the civil war with about fifty monitor-type coastal ironclads by the 1870s most of these were laid up in reserve leaving the usa virtually without an ironclad fleet another five large monitors were ordered in the 1870s the limitations of the monitor type effectively prevented the usa from projecting power overseas and until the 1890s the usa would have come off badly in a conflict with even spain or the latin american powers the 1890s saw the beginning of what became the great white fleet and it was the modern pre-dreadnoughts and armored cruisers built in the 1890s which defeated the spanish fleet in the spanish–american war of 1898 this started a new era of naval warfare
ironclads were widely used in south america both sides used ironclads in the chincha islands war between spain and the combined forces of peru and chile in the early 1860s the powerful spanish numancia participated in the battle of callao but was unable to inflict significant damage to the callao defences besides peru was able to deploy two locally built ironclads based on american civil war designs the loa a wooden ship converted into a casemate ironclad and the victoria a small monitor armed with a single 68-pdr gun as well as two british-built ironclads independencia a centre-battery ship and the turret ship huáscar numancia was the first ironclad to circumnavigate the world arriving in cádiz on 20 september 1867 and earning the motto enloricata navis que primo terram circuivit first ironclad ship to sail around the world in the war of the pacific in 1879 both peru and chile had ironclad warships including some of those used a few years previously against spain while the independencia ran aground early on the peruvian ironclad'huáscar made a great impact against chilean shipping delaying chilean ground invasion by six months she was eventually caught by two more modern chilean centre-battery ironclads the blanco encalada and the almirante cochrane at the battle of angamos point
ironclads were also used from the inception of the imperial japanese navy the kōtetsu japanese  literally ironclad later renamed azuma  east had a decisive role in the naval battle of hakodate bay in may 1869 which marked the end of the boshin war and the complete establishment of the meiji restoration the ijn continued to develop its strength and commissioned a number of warships from british and european shipyards first ironclads and later armored cruisers these ships engaged the chinese beiyang fleet which was superior on paper at least at the battle of the yalu river thanks to superior short-range firepower the japanese fleet came off better sinking or severely damaging eight ships and receiving serious damage to only four the naval war was concluded the next year at the battle of weihaiwei where the strongest remaining chinese ships were surrendered to the japanese
there is no clearly defined end to the ironclad besides the transition from wood hulls to all-metal ironclads continued to be used in world war i. towards the end of the 19th century the descriptions'battleship'and'armored cruiser'came to replace the term'ironclad'.
the proliferation of ironclad battleship designs came to an end in the 1890s as navies reached a consensus on the design of battleships producing the type known as the pre-dreadnought these ships are sometimes covered in treatments of the ironclad warship the next evolution of battleship design the dreadnought is never referred to as an'ironclad'.
most of the ironclads of the 1870s and 1880s served into the 1900s decade for instance a handful of us navy monitors laid down in the 1870s saw active service in world war i. pre-dreadnought battleships and cruisers of the 1890s saw widespread action in world war i and in some cases through to world war ii
the example of the ironclads had some bearing on the history of the tank as ironclad warships became an inspiration for ideas of landships and other armored vehicles h. g. wells in his short story the land ironclads published in the strand magazine in december 1903 described the use of large armoured cross-country vehicles armed with cannon and machine guns and equipped with pedrail wheels

little gidding is the fourth and final poem of t. s. eliot's four quartets a series of poems that discuss time perspective humanity and salvation it was first published in september 1942 after being delayed for over a year because of the air-raids on great britain during world war ii and eliot's declining health the title refers to a small anglican community in huntingdonshire established by nicholas ferrar in the 17th century and scattered during the english civil war
the poem uses the combined image of fire and pentecostal fire to emphasise the need for purification and purgation according to the poet humanity's flawed understanding of life and turning away from god leads to a cycle of warfare but this can be overcome by recognising the lessons of the past within the poem the narrator meets a ghost that is a combination of various poets and literary figures little gidding focuses on the unity of past present and future and claims that understanding this unity is necessary for salvation
following the completion of the third four quartets poem the dry salvages eliot's health declined and he stayed in shamley green surrey while he recovered during this time eliot started writing little gidding the first draft was completed in july 1941 but he was dissatisfied with it he believed the problems with the poem lay with his own inability to write and that precipitated by air raids on london he had started the poem with too little preparation and had written it too quickly after the first draft was written he set the poem aside and he left in september to lecture throughout great britain
after months of not working on the poem eliot began to feel compelled to finish it it was not until august 1942 however that he started working on it again in total there were five drafts the poem was finished by 19 september 1942 and published in the october new english weekly little gidding was intended to conclude the four quartets series summarising eliot's views expressed in this series of poems
little gidding was the home of an anglican community established in 1626 by nicholas ferrar the ferrar household lived a christian life according to high church principles and the book of common prayer the religious community was dispersed during the english civil war between parliamentarians and royalists but reformed ending with the death of john ferrar in 1657 eliot had visited the site in may 1936
unlike the other locations mentioned in the titles of the four quartets poems eliot had no direct connection to the original christian community as such the community is supposed to represent almost any religious community
critics classify little gidding as a poem of fire with an emphasis on purgation and the pentecostal fire the beginning of the poem discusses time and winter with attention paid to the arrival of summer the images of snow which provoke desires for a spiritual life transition into an analysis of the four classical elements of fire earth air and water and how fire is the primary element of the four following this is a discussion on death and destruction things unaccomplished and regret for past events
while using dante's terza rima style the poem continues by describing the battle of britain the image of warfare merges with the depiction of pentecost and the holy spirit is juxtaposed with the air-raids on london in the second section a ghost representing the poets of the past stuck between worlds begins talking to the narrator of the poem the ghost discusses change art in general and how humankind is flawed the only way to overcome the problematic condition of humanity according to the ghost is to experience purgation through fire the fire is described in a manner similar to julian of norwich's writing about god's love and discussed in relationship to the shirt of nessus a shirt that burns its wearer little gidding continues by describing the eternalness of the present and how history exists in a pattern the poem concludes by explaining how sacrifice is needed to allow an individual to die into life and be reborn and that salvation should be the goal of humankind
in terms of renewal eliot believed that suffering was needed for all of society before new life could begin the original little gidding community was built for living on monastic lines but the community was damaged and dispersed by puritan forces during the english civil war in 1646 the church the centre of the community was restored in 1714 and again in 1853 the image of religious renewal is combined with the image of the london air-raids and the constant fighting and destruction within the world this compound image is used to discuss the connection of holy places with the holy spirit pentecost communion with the dead and the repetition of history the theme is also internal to eliot's own poems the image of the rose garden at the end little gidding is the image that begins burnt norton and the journey is made circular also the depiction of time within the poem is similar to the way time operates within the family reunion
like the other poems making up the four quartets little gidding deals with the past present and future and humanity's place within them as each generation is seemingly united in the second section there is a ghost who is the compilation of various poets including dante swift yeats and others when the ghost joins the poet the narrator states knowing myself yet being someone other this suggests that the different times merge at the same time that the different personalities begin to merge allowing a communication and connection with the dead later in the fourth section humanity is given a choice between the holy spirit or the bombing of london redemption or destruction god's love allows humankind to be redeemed and escape the living hell through purgation by fire the end of the poem describes how eliot has attempted to help the world as a poet he parallels his work in language with working on the soul or working on society
the ghost a combination of many literary figures was originally addressed in the poem as ser brunetto before being revised as an ambiguous you ser brunetto was dante's way of addressing brunetto latini a former mentor whom he meets in hell to which he has been condemned for sodomy eliot in a letter to john hayward dated 27 august 1942 explained why he changed the wording
i think you will recognise that it was necessary to get rid of brunetto for two reasons the first is that the visionary figure has now become somewhat more definite and will no doubt be identified by some readers with yeats though i do not mean anything so precise as that however i do not wish to take the responsibility of putting yeats or anybody else into hell and i do not want to impute to him the particular vice which took brunetto there secondly although the reference to that canto is intended to be explicit i wish the effect of the whole to be purgatorial which is more appropriate that brings us to the reference to swimming in fire which you will remember at the end of purgatorio 26 where the poets are found
the theme of swimming through flames is connected to the depiction of guido guinizelli a poet that influenced dante seeking such a state in purgatorio xxvi however the depiction of swimming was transformed into an image of dancing an act that appears throughout yeats's poetry within purgatorial flames the critic dominic manganiello suggests that in combining the image of dancing with purgation eliot merges dante's and yeats's poetic themes
critics such as malcolm cowley and delmore schwartz describe mixed emotions about the religiosity of the poem cowley emphasised the mystical nature of the poem and how its themes were closer to buddhism than anglicanism while mentioning his appreciation of many of the passages schwartz also mentioned the buddhist images and his admiration for many of the lines in little gidding f. b. pinion believed that the fourth section of the poem costs eliot more trouble and vexation than any passage of the same length he ever wrote and is his greatest achievement in the four quartets e. m. forster did not like eliot's emphasis on pain and responded to the poem of course there's pain on and off through each individual's life ... you can 't shirk it and so on but why should it be endorsed by the schoolmaster and sanctified by the priest until the fire and the rose are one when so much of it is caused by disease and bullies it is here that eliot becomes unsatisfactory as a seer writing in 2003 roger scruton wrote that in little gidding eliot achieved that for which he envies dante — namely a poetry of belief in which belief and words are one and in which the thought cannot be prized free from the controlled and beautiful language
the portage to san cristobal of a.h. is a 1981 literary and philosophical novella by george steiner in which jewish nazi hunters find a fictional adolf hitler a.h. alive in the amazon jungle thirty years after the end of world war ii the book generated considerable controversy after its publication because in it steiner who is jewish allows hitler to defend himself when he is put on trial in the jungle by his captors there hitler maintains that israel owes its existence to the holocaust and that he is the benefactor of the jews
the portage to san cristobal of a.h. was a 1983 finalist in the pen faulkner award for fiction it was adapted for the theatre by british playwright christopher hampton and was staged in london in april 1982 with alec mccowen playing the part of adolf hitler it was also staged in hartford connecticut in the united states in 1983 and starred john cullum as hitler
from his base in tel aviv holocaust survivor emmanuel lieber directs a group of jewish nazi hunters in search of adolf hitler lieber believes that the former führer is still alive and following rumours and hearsay he tracks hitler's movements through south america until after months of wading through swamps in the amazon jungle the search party finds the 90-year-old alive in a clearing lieber flies to san cristóbal where he awaits the group's return with their captive but getting the old man out of the jungle alive is more difficult than getting in and their progress is further hampered by heavy thunderstorms
meanwhile broken and incoherent radio messages between lieber and the search party are intercepted by intelligence agents tracking their progress and rumours begin to spread across the world of hitler's capture debates flare up over his impending trial where it will be held and under whose jurisdiction orosso is identified as the nearest airfield to the last known location of the search party and aircraft begin arriving at the hitherto unknown town but when the search party loses radio contact with lieber they must make a decision do they sit out the storms and deliver their captive to lieber later or do they try hitler in the jungle before their prize is snatched from them by the world at large who they know will be waiting their decision is the latter and against lieber's advice you must not let him speak ... his tongue is like no other they prepare for a trial with a judge prosecution and defence attorneys selected from the members of the search party teku a local indian tracker is asked to observe the trial as an independent witness
the attention hitler is receiving however renews his strength and when the trial begins he brushes aside his defence attorney and begins a long speech in four parts in his own defence
firstly hitler claims he took his doctrines from the jews and copied the notion of the master race from the chosen people and their need to separate themselves from the unclean my racism is a parody of yours a hungry imitation
hitler justifies the final solution by maintaining that the jews'god purer than any other enslaves its subjects continually demanding more than they can give and blackmailing them with ideals that cannot be attained the virus of utopia had to be stopped
hitler states that he was not the originator of evil stalin had perfected genocide when i was still a nameless scribbler in munich further hitler asserts that the number of lives lost due to his actions are dwarfed by various world atrocities including those in russia china and africa
lastly hitler maintains that the reich begat israel and suggests that he is the messiah whose infamous deeds were allowed by god in order to bring his people home he closes by asking should you not honour me who have made ... zion a reality
at the end of his speech teku is the first to react and jumps up shouting proven only to be drowned out by the appearance of a helicopter over the clearing
emmanuel lieber–jewish holocaust survivor and director of the search party to find hitler after crawling out of a death pit in bialka he never took the time to mend and embarked on a life-consuming obsession to bring those responsible for the genocide to justice
search party all jewish with family ties to the holocaust except for john asher
simeon–search party leader and presiding judge at hitler's trial he is lieber's confidant and torn between leading the party into unmapped quicksand and green bogs and turning his back on the quiet mania of lieber's conviction
gideon benasseraf–falls ill and dies before the trial begins during one of his fever-induced ramblings he suggests that hitler is jewish he had sought out lieber after being released from a sanatorium and spending three years recuperating in paris where the care-free living consumed him with guilt
elie barach–orthodox jew and prosecution attorney at the trial he is the moral compass of the group but his convictions are disturbed by gideon benasseraf's fever-induced assertions that hitler is jewish and ends up believing that hitler may be the second messiah
isaac amsel–an 18-year-old boy and witness at the trial he is the son of isaac amsel senior former member of the search party killed earlier in a skirmish in são paulo he joined the party to avenge his father's death
john asher–half-jewish and reluctant defence attorney at the trial fascinated by the capture of bormann and the rumours circulating that hitler may be alive he had approached nazi hunter wiesenthal who directed him to lieber despite being an outsider no ties to the holocaust lieber assigned him to the search party because of his military training and his clear-headedness no metaphysical lusts no cravings for retribution
teku–local indian tracker and independent witness at the trial previously the search party's guide who had abandoned them when they insisted on entering uncharted regions of the jungle he continued tracking them from a distance before revealing himself
adolf hitler–now 90 years old the former leader of the third reich had not died in the führerbunker in berlin but escaped to south america and hid in the amazon jungle
george steiner literary critic for the new yorker and the new york times had written about the holocaust in some of his previous books including anno domini 1964 language and silence 1967 and in bluebeard's castle 1971 many of the ideas steiner expresses in the portage to san cristobal of a.h. were reworked from these earlier works steiner told new york times editor d. j. r. bruckner that this book arose out of his lifelong work on language central to everything i am and believe and have written is my astonishment ... that you can use human speech both to bless to love to build to forgive and also to torture to hate to destroy and to annihilate
commenting on the controversy the book generated steiner admitted to literary journalist and critic ron rosenbaum author of explaining hitler that he too was disturbed by it adding that his fictional hitler had gotten the better of him golem- or frankenstein-like he said that it felt like the book wrote me steiner also pointed out that the novella is not only about his thoughts on the holocaust but also about the horrific events that took place in countries like cambodia vietnam el salvador and burundi my feeling is that one has to grapple with the abyss if one can
steiner wrote the portage to san cristobal of a.h. in 1975 and 1976 in geneva switzerland and the 120-page work originally appeared in the spring 1979 issue of the united states literary magazine the kenyon review it also appeared in the spring 1980 issue of granta the british literary magazine its first publication in book form with minor revisions by steiner was in may 1981 by faber and faber in the united kingdom — and as requested by steiner it was a paperback original the first united states edition was published in hardcover in april 1982 by simon schuster
the portage to san cristobal of a.h. was adapted for the theatre in 1982 by british playwright christopher hampton it was staged in april 1982 at london's mermaid theatre under the direction of john dexter with alec mccowen playing the part of adolf hitler mccowen won the 1982 evening standard theatre award for best actor for this performance in 1983 the production moved to the united states where it played at the hartford stage company in hartford connecticut directed by mark lamos and starring john cullum as hitler
this book is the only work of fiction by steiner to have been adapted for the stage
reaction to the portage to san cristobal of a.h. was mixed anthony burgess in the observer called it astonishing christopher booker of the daily telegraph described it as a powerful piece and english author a. s. byatt said it was a masterpiece in explaining hitler ron rosenbaum called the portage a frankenstein story referring to steiner's fictive hitler has having taken on a life of its own writing in time magazine otto friedrich described the book a philosophic fantasy of remarkable intensity adding that by not refuting hitler's speech steiner deviates from the horrors of traditional holocaust literature and ends the book on a note of bleak ambiguity
morris dickstein of the new york times was more critical of the book calling it a misconceived and badly executed novel a sideshow distraction from the serious business of thinking through the unspeakable horrors of the nazi era he described it as wearisome that is suffocate d by too much fine writing belles-lettres he also complained that the characters are lifeless and while they each have detailed histories they are only verbal figments that do not separate them from one another finally dickstein noted that because almost all the points of hitler's speech are drawn from some of steiner's earlier works he unwittingly creates sympathy for hitler by making him old and pathetic yet also lucid and brilliant — at once absurdly harmless and unconvincingly dangerous
in another review in the new york times john leonard wrote that while the book has its strong points some wit a catholic disdain multiplicity of character and a south american swamp-life that terrifies its weaknesses are that the characters are really ideas ... the symbols clash and there are too many echoes of better books by kafka and proust but leonard's biggest criticism of the book was hitler's speech which he called obscene and steiner's decision to end the book at that point which leonard said not only denies the power of art to arrange and transcend but ... makes me sick to my stomach
writing in the american literary magazine salmagundi alvin h. rosenfeld called the portage a breakthrough work that astonishes he was struck by the book's interplay between the landscape of swamp and jungle and the landscape of speech — the former being brilliantly registered with its immense feeling of physicality and the latter even more dramatic in the way it exposes the dark underside of words and how its use and misuse reveals the true nature of a person he was particularly impressed by the depiction of nazi hunter emmanuel lieber and his role as representative of the jewish consciousness rosenfeld noted that while holocaust literature often either soars to expostulation and apostrophe or sinks to a dwindling sob of elegiac lament steiner's lieber mediates between these two extremes ... simultaneously records and mourns coldly enumerates yet carries an immense affect what did concern the reviewer however was the way steiner used ideas from his earlier works that he had put them virtually verbatim into hitler's mouth creating the impression that steiner's understanding of hitler were identical with the latter's self-understanding rosenfeld also questioned why the book had to end with hitler's speech he said that steiner's fictive hitler plays the devil's game of language subversion making madness sound like music something the real hitler had perfected by stopping at this point rosenfeld felt that steiner succumb s rhetorically to the seductive eloquence of negation which undermines his own high standards of moral intelligence but overall rosenfeld said the portage must be counted among the most vigorous attempts to portray the presence and meaning of hitler forcing us to confront him in a way hardly seen before in fiction
the portage to san cristobal of a.h. was a finalist in the 1983 pen faulkner award for fiction
the book generated considerable controversy because of its apparent admiration for hitler the controversy grew further when the faithful stage adaptation too faithful according to steiner was performed in the united kingdom and the united states
hitler's speech at the end of the book disturbed many readers and critics steiner not only lets hitler justify his past he allows him the almost last word before the outside world invades the fact that steiner is jewish made this speech in particular even more contentious one critic while acknowledging that steiner always saw hitler as the incarnation of unprecedented and unparalleled evil felt that there was no clear distinction in the book between steiner's own views and those of his fictional hitler even going so far as to accuse steiner who rejects jewish nationalism and is a critic of israel's treatment of the palestinians of anti-semitism
in contrast a time magazine article at the time felt that steiner's intention for the hitler speech was to use it to explore his previously stated belief that hitler wielded language as an almost supernatural force drawing attention to nazi hunter emmanuel lieber's warning from the book regarding hitler there shall come a man who ... will know the grammar of hell and teach it to others he will know the sounds of madness and loathing and make them seem music
steiner responded to criticism that hitler's speech in this book is unchallenged by saying that it had been done before for example satan's speech in milton's paradise lost 1667 and the grand inquisitor's speech in dostoyevsky's the brothers karamazov 1880 he also reminded the reader that hitler's speech is balanced out earlier in the book by lieber's long monologue on the horrors of the holocaust finally steiner said that his hitler a. h. is a fictive figure and that it is not he who has the last word but teku the indian tracker who shouts proven teku is also the hebrew word used to indicate that there are issues here beyond our wisdom to answer or decide
temnospondyli from greek τέμνειν temnein to cut and σπόνδυλος spondylos vertebra is a diverse subclass of extinct small to giant tetrapods — often considered primitive amphibians — that flourished worldwide during the carboniferous permian and triassic periods a few species continued into the cretaceous fossils have been found on every continent during about 210 million years of evolutionary history they adapted to a wide range of habitats including fresh water terrestrial and even coastal marine environments their life history is well understood with fossils known from the larval stage metamorphosis and maturity most temnospondyls were semiaquatic although some were almost fully terrestrial returning to the water only to breed these temnospondyls were some of the first vertebrates fully adapted to life on land although temnospondyls are considered amphibians many had characteristics such as scales claws and armour-like bony plates that distinguish them from modern amphibians
temnospondyls have been known since the early 19th century and were initially thought to be reptiles they were described at various times as batrachians stegocephalians and labyrinthodonts although these names are now rarely used animals now grouped in temnospondyli were spread out among several amphibian groups until the early 20th century when they were found to belong to a distinct taxon based on the structure of their vertebrae temnospondyli means cut vertebrae as each vertebra is divided into several parts
experts disagree over whether temnospondyls were ancestral to modern amphibians frogs salamanders and caecilians or whether the whole group died out without leaving any descendants different hypotheses have placed modern amphibians as the descendants of temnospondyls another group of early tetrapods called lepospondyls or even as descendants of both groups with caecilians evolving from lepospondyls and frogs and salamanders evolving from temnospondyls recent studies place a family of temnospondyls called the amphibamids as the closest relatives of modern amphibians similarities in teeth skulls and hearing structures link the two groups
many temnospondyls are much larger than living amphibians and superficially resemble crocodiles others are smaller and resemble salamanders most have broad flat heads that are either blunt brevirostrine or elongated longirostrine the skulls are rounded or triangular in shape when viewed from above and are usually covered in pits and ridges the rugged surfaces of bones may have supported blood vessels which could transfer carbon dioxide to the bones to neutralize acidic build up in the blood early semiaquatic tetrapods would have had difficulty expelling carbon dioxide from their bodies while on land and these dermal bones may have been an early solution to the problem many temnospondyls also have canal-like grooves in their skulls called sensory sulci the sulci which usually run around the nostrils and eye sockets are part of a lateral line system used to detect vibrations in water as semiaquatic animals most temnospondyls have small limbs with four toes on each front foot and five on each hind foot terrestrial temnospondyls have larger thicker limbs and some even have claws one unusual terrestrial temnospondyl fayella has relatively long limbs for its body and probably lived as an active runner able to chase prey
homologues of most of the bones of temnospondyls are also seen in other early tetrapods aside from a few bones in the skull such as interfrontals internasals and interparietals that have developed in some temnospondyl taxa most temnospondyls have tabular horns in the backs of their skulls rounded projections of bone separated from the rest of the skull by indentations called otic notches in some temnospondyls such as zatrachys they are pointed and very prominent among the most distinguishing features of temnospondyls are the interpterygoid vacuities two large holes in the back of the palate another pair of holes choanae are present in front of these vacuities and connect the nasal passage with the mouth temnospondyls often have teeth on their palates as well as in their jaws some of these teeth are so large they are referred to as tusks in some temnospondyls such as nigerpeton tusks in the lower jaw pierce the palate and emerge through openings in the top of the skull
very little is known of the soft tissue of temnospondyls a block of sandstone described in 2007 from the early carboniferous mauch chunk formation of pennsylvania included impressions of the bodies of three temnospondyls these impressions show when alive they had smooth skin robust limbs with webbed feet and a ridge of skin on their undersides trackways referable to small temnospondyls have also been found in carboniferous and permian rocks the trackways called batrachichni are usually found in strata deposited around freshwater environments suggesting the animals had some ties to the water
unlike modern amphibians many temnospondyls are covered in small closely packed scales the undersides of most temnospondyls are covered in rows of large ventral plates during early stages of development they first have only small rounded scales fossils show as the animals grew the scales on the undersides of their bodies developed into large wide ventral plates the plates overlap each other in a way that allows a wide range of flexibility later semiaquatic temnospondyls such as trematosaurs and capitosaurs have no evidence of scales they may have lost scales to make movement easier under water or to allow cutaneous respiration the absorption of oxygen through the skin
several groups of temnospondyls have large bony plates on their backs one temnospondyl peltobatrachus has armour-like plating that covers both its back and underside the temnospondyl laidleria also has extensive plating on its back most members of the family dissorophidae also have armor although it only covers the midline of the back with two narrow rows of plates other temnospondyls such as eryops have been found with small disc-like bony scutes that were in life probably embedded in the skin all of these temnospondyls were adapted to a terrestrial lifestyle armor may have offered protection from predators in the case of peltobatrachus the scutes may have provided stability for the spine as they would have limited flexibility and may have been connected by strong ligaments temnospondyls such as sclerothorax and eryops that may have been at least partly terrestrial also have long neural spines on top of their vertebrae that would have stabilized the spine bony scutes are also seen in plagiosaurs but unlike peltobatrachus laidleria eryops and dissorophids these animals are thought to have been fully aquatic plagiosaurs may have inherited their armor from a terrestrial ancestor as both peltobatrachus and laidleria have been considered close relatives of the group
temnospondyls'vertebrae are divided into several segments in living tetrapods the main body of the vertebra is a single piece of bone called the centrum but in temnospondyls this region was divided into a pleurocentrum and intercentrum two types of vertebrae are recognized in temnospondyls stereospondylous and rhachitomous vertebrae in rhachitomous vertebrae the intercentra are large and wedge-shaped and the pleurocentra are relatively small blocks that fit between them both elements support a spine-like neural arch and well-developed interlocking projections called zygapophyses strengthen the connections between vertebrae the strong backbone and strong limbs of many ratchitomous temnospondyls allowed them to be partially and in some cases fully terrestrial in stereospondylous vertebrae the pleurocentra have been lost entirely with the intercentra enlarged as the main body of the vertebrae this weaker type of backbone indicates the stereospondylous temnospondyls spent more time in water
temnospondyli was named by german palaeontologist karl alfred von zittel in his second edition of handbuch der palaeontologie published in 1888 temnospondyl remains were known since the early part of the 19th century however the earliest described temnospondyl was mastodonsaurus named by georg friedrich jaeger in 1828 jaeger named mastodonsaurus from a single tooth and considered it a reptile mastodonsaurus means breast tooth lizard after the nipple-like shape of the tip of the tooth
the naming of these first specimens was disputed however leopold fitzinger named the animal batrachosaurus in 1837 in 1841 english palaeontologist richard owen referred to the genus as labyrinthodon to describe its highly folded or labyrinthine teeth owen thought the name mastodonsaurus ought not to be retained because it recalls unavoidably the idea of the mammalian genus mastodon or else a mammilloid form of the tooth ... and because the second element of the word saurus indicates a false affinity the remains belonging not to the saurian but to the batrachian order of reptiles owen recognized the animal was not a saurian reptile yet he also referred jaeger's phytosaurus to the genus although the two genera both have similarly sized conical teeth phytosaurus was later found to be a crocodile-like reptile additional material including skulls firmly placed labyrinthodon as an amphibian jaeger also named salamandroides giganteus in 1828 basing it on partial occiput or back portion of the skull in 1833 he described a complete skull of s. giganteus that had the same teeth as his mastodonsaurus making it the first known complete skull of a temnospondyl because mastodonsaurus was named first it has precedence over the other names as a senior subjective synonym batrachosaurus is still used as the name of an unrelated brachyopid temnospondyl
mastodonsaurus and other similar animals were referred to as labyrinthodonts named like labyrinthodon for teeth that were highly folded in cross section owen's labyrinthodon jaegeri was later found at guy's cliffe england by paleontologist william buckland other specimens were found in the red sandstone of warwickshire as more fossils were uncovered in england owen depicted these labyrinthodonts as the highest form of batrachian and compared them to crocodiles which he considered the highest form of reptiles he also noted the large labyrinthodonts of the keuper a unit of rocks that dates to the late triassic were younger than more advanced reptiles in the magnesian and zechstein which are late permian in age owen used these fossils to counter the notion that reptiles evolved from a sequential progression from early amphibians what he called metamorphosed fishes
in addition to mastodonsaurus some of the earliest named genera included metopias and rhombopholis in 1842 zygosaurus in 1848 trematosaurus in 1849 baphetes and dendrerpeton in 1853 capitosaurus in 1858 and dasyceps in 1859 baphetes is now placed as an early tetrapod outside temnospondyli and rhombopholis is now considered a prolacertiform reptile
later in the 19th century temnospondyls were classified as various members of stegocephalia a name coined by american paleontologist edward drinker cope in 1868 cope placed stegocephalians in the class batrachia the name then used for amphibia stegocephalia means roof-headed in greek a reference to the wide flat heads of temnospondyls and other early tetrapods during this time palaeontologists considered temnospondyls to be amphibians because they possessed three main features gill arches in juvenile skeletons indicating they were amphibious for at least the first part of their lives ribs that do not connect at the underside of the rib cage and deep pits in the skull that were interpreted as space for mucous glands
several suborders of stegocephalians were recognized in the late 19th and early 20th centuries animals now regarded as temnospondyls were primarily labyrinthodonts but some were classified in the branchiosauria branchiosaurs were small-bodied and had simple conical teeth while labyrinthodonts were larger and had complex folded dentin and enamel in their teeth branchiosauria included only a few forms such as branchiosaurus from europe and amphibamus from north america that had poorly developed bones external gills and no ribs some skeletons of amphibamus were later found with long ribs prompting its reassignment to microsauria although more detailed studies found it to be a temnospondyl soft tissue such as scales and external gills were found in many well-preserved branchiosaur fossils from germany in the early 20th century branchiosaurs would be recognized as larval forms of temnospondyls lacking many of the typical features that define the group and is no longer recognized as a distinct group
other animals that would later be classified as temnospondyls were placed in a group called ganocephala characterized by plate-like skull bones small limbs fish-like scales and branchial arches unlike labyrinthodonts they did not have parietal foramena small holes in their skulls behind their eye sockets archegosaurus dendrerpeton eryops and trimerorhachis were placed in this group and were considered to be the most primitive members of reptilia their rhachitomous vertebrae notochord and lack of occipital condyles which attached the head to the neck were features that were also shared with fishes thus they were considered a link between early fishes and more advanced forms such as stegocephalians
another group called microsauria was named by cope in 1868 cope classified microsauria as a subgroup of labyrinthodontia placing many small amphibian-like animals within it among them were dendrerpeton once placed in ganocephala dendrerpeton was later placed as a labyrinthodont with other temnospondyls but confusion existed for many years over the classification of small amphibians
by the end of the 19th century most of what are today regarded as temnospondyls were placed in the suborder labyrinthodonta american paleontologist ermine cowles case called it labyrinthodonta vera or true labyrinthodonts the names stegocephalia and labyrinthodontia were used interchangeably to refer to the order in which it belonged the labyrinthodontian suborders microsauria and branchiosauria both of which contain temnospondyls were distinct from labyrinthodonta within labyrinthodonta were the groups rhachitomi labyrinthodonti and embolerimi members of rhachitomi such as archegosaurus and eryops had rhachitomous vertebrae with enlarged intercentra that displaced the pleurocentra labyrinthodonti such as mastodonsaurus trematosaurus and micropholis had lost their pleurocentra and the intercentra made up the entire body of the vertebrae embolerimi had intercentra and pleurocentra that were of equal size embolomeres are now identified as reptiliomorphs distantly related to temnospondyls
in 1888 von zittel divided stegocephalians among three taxa lepospondyli temnospondyli and stereospondyli he placed microsaurs in lepospondyli a group which he characterized as having simple spool-shaped vertebral centra temnospondyli included forms with the centra divided into pleurocentra and intercentra all members of stereospondyli had amphicoelous centra composed only of the intercentra cope objected to von zittel's classification considering the vertebrae of lepospondyls and stereospondyls indistinguishable because each had a simple spool shape he continued to use ganocephala and labyrinthodonta which he alternatively referred to as rhachitomi to distinguish animals based on the absence or presence of occipital condyles
temnospondyli became a commonly used name at the turn of the century paleontologists included both embolomeres and rhachitomes in the group cope's ganocephala and labyrinthodonta fell out of use in 1919 british paleontologist d. m. s. watson proposed that the evolutionary history of these large amphibians could be seen through changes in their vertebrae embolomerous forms in the carboniferous graded into rhachitomous forms in the permian and finally into stereospondyls in the triassic more importantly watson began using the term labyrinthodontia to refer to these groups the name temnospondyli was rarely used in the decades that followed swedish paleontologist gunnar säve-söderbergh removed embolomeres from the group narrowing its scope to rhachitomes and stereospondyls his classification of labyrinthodonts was based heavily on characteristics of the skull rather than the vertebrae
american paleontologist alfred romer brought the name temnospondyli back into use in the later 20th century säve-söderbergh used the name labyrinthodontia in a strict sense sensu stricto to refer to rhachitomi and stereospondyli excluding embolomeri romer agreed with this classification but used the name temnospondyli to avoid confusion with labyrinthodontia in its wider sense sensu lato unlike modern temnospondyl classification however romer included the primitive ichthyostegalia in the group
temnospondyls first appeared in the early carboniferous around 330 million years ago mya during the carboniferous temnospondyls included basal medium-sized forms such as dendrerpeton or large semiaquatic forms such as cochleosaurus other more derived temnospondyls such as the amphibamids were smaller and more terrestrial they resembled salamanders and some taxa such as the genus branchiosaurus even retained external gills like the modern-day axolotl during the latest carboniferous and early permian around 300 mya several groups such as the dissorophids and trematopids evolved strong robust limbs and vertebrae and became adapted to life on land while others such as the eryopids developed into large semiaquatic predators the dvinosaurs a group of small aquatic temnospondyls evolved from terrestrial ancestors in the late carboniferous
during the late permian increasing aridity and the diversification of reptiles contributed into a decline in terrestrial temnospondyls but semiaquatic and fully aquatic temnospondyls continued to flourish including the large melosaurus of eastern europe other temnospondyls such as archegosaurids developed long snouts and a close similarity to crocodiles although they lacked the armor characteristic of the latter group these temnospondyls included the largest known amphibian the 9-m-long prionosuchus of brazil
as temnospondyls continued to flourish and diversify in the late permian 260.4 251.0 mya a major group called stereospondyli became more dependent on life in the water the vertebrae became weak the limbs small and the skull large and flat with the eyes facing upwards during the triassic period these animals dominated the freshwater ecosystems evolving in a range of both small and large forms during the early triassic 251.0 245.0 mya one group of successful long-snouted fish-eaters the trematosauroids even adapted to a life in the sea the only known amphibians to do so with the exception of the modern crab-eating frog another group the capitosauroids included medium- and large-sized animals 2.3 to 4 m 7.5 to 13.1 ft in length with large and flat skulls that could be over a meter long in the largest forms such as mastodonsaurus these animals spent most or all their lives in water as aquatic predators catching their prey by a sudden opening of the upper jaw and sucking in fish or other small animals
in the carnian stage of the late triassic 228.0 216.5 mya capitosauroids were joined by the superficially very similar metoposauridae metoposaurids are distinguished from capitosauroids by the positioning of their eye sockets near the front of their skulls another group of stereospondyls the plagiosaurs had wide heads with external gills and adapted to life at the bottom of lakes and rivers by this time temnospondyls had become a common and widespread component of semiaquatic ecosystems some temnospondyls such as cryobatrachus and kryostega even inhabited antarctica which was covered in temperate forests at the time
triassic temnospondyls were often the dominant semiaquatic animals in their environments large assemblages of metoposaurs with hundreds of individuals preserved together have been found in the southwestern united states they have often been interpreted as mass death events caused by droughts in floodplain environments recent studies show these dense assemblages were instead probably the result of currents accumulating dead individuals in certain areas these environments seem to have had little diversity as they were inhabited almost exclusively by metoposaurs
the triassic-jurassic extinction event around 199.6 mya led to the extinction of most mesozoic temnospondyls the brachyopoids survived as well as a few capitosauroids and trematosauroids while the latter two groups soon became extinct brachyopoids persisted and grew to large sizes during the jurassic among brachyopoids the brachyopids flourished in china and the chigutisaurids became common in gondwana the most recent known temnospondyl was the giant chigutisaurid koolasuchus known from the early cretaceous of australia it survived in rift valleys that were too cold in the winter for crocodiles that normally would have competed with them koolasuchus was one of the largest of the brachyopoids with an estimated weight of 500 kg 1,100 lb
originally temnospondyls were classified according to the structure of their vertebrae early forms with complex vertebrae consisting of a number of separate elements were placed in the suborder rachitomi and large triassic aquatic forms with simpler vertebrae were placed in the suborder stereospondyli with the recent growth of phylogenetics this classification is no longer viable the basic rhachitomous condition is found in many primitive tetrapods and is not unique to one group of temnospondyls moreover the distinction between rhachitomous and stereospondylous vertebrae is not entirely clear some temnospondyls have rhachitomous semirhachitomous and sterospondylous vertebrae at different points in the same vertebral column other taxa have intermediate morphologies that do not fit into any category rachitomi is no longer recognized as a group but stereospondyli is still considered valid below is a simplified taxonomy of temnospondyls showing currently recognized groups

in one of the earliest phylogenetic analyses of the group gardiner 1983 recognized five characteristics that made temnospondyli a clade a bone at the back of the skull the parasphenoid is connected to another bone on the underside of the skull the pterygoid large openings called interpterygoid vacuities are present between the pterygoids the stapes a bone involved in hearing is connected to the parasphenoid and projects upward the cleithrum a bone in the pectoral girdle is thin and part of the vertebra called the interdorsal attaches to the neural arch additional features were given by godfrey et al 1987 including the contact between the postparietal and exoccipital at the back of the skull small projections uncinate processes on the ribs and a pelvic girdle with each side having a single iliac blade these shared characteristics are called synapomorphies
temnospondyls are placed as basal tetrapods in phylogenetic analyses with their exact positioning varying between studies depending on the classification of modern amphibians they are either included in the crown group tetrapoda or the stem of tetrapoda crown-group tetrapods are descendants of the most recent common ancestor of all living tetrapods and stem tetrapods are forms that are outside the crown group modern amphibians have recently been suggested as descendants of temnospondyls which would place them within crown tetrapoda below is a cladogram from ruta et al 2003 placing temnospondyli within crown tetrapoda
other studies place modern amphibians as the descendants of lepospondyls and place temnospondyls in a more basal position within the stem of tetrapoda below is a cladogram from laurin and reisz 1999 placing temnospondyli outside crown tetrapoda
most phylogenetic analyses of temnospondyl interrelationships focus on individual families one of the first broad-scale studies of temnospondyl phylogeny was conducted by paleontologist andrew milner in 1990 a 2007 study made a supertree of all temnospondyl families combining the family-level trees of previous studies the following cladogram is modified from ruta et al 2007
1 temnospondyli 2 edopoidea 3 dvinosauria 4 euskelia 5 eryopoidea 6 dissorophoidea 7 limnarchia 8 archegosauroidea 9 stereospondyli 10 rhytidostea 11 brachyopoidea 12 capitosauria 13 trematosauria 14 metoposauroidea
the most basal group of temnospondyls is the superfamily edopoidea edopoids have several primitive or plesiomorphic features including a single occipital condyle and a bone called the intertemporal that is absent in other temnospondyls edopoids include the late carboniferous genus edops and the family cochleosauridae dendrerpetontidae has also been included in edopoidea and is the oldest known temnospondyl family balanerpeton woodi is the oldest species having been present over 330 million years ago during the viséan stage of the early carboniferous recent analyses place dendrerpetontidae outside edopoidea in a more derived position other primitive temnospondyls include capetus and iberospondylus saharastega and nigerpeton both described in 2005 from niger are also primitive yet come from the late permian they are almost 40 million years younger than other basal temnospondyls implying a long ghost lineage of species that are not yet known in the fossil record
in 2000 paleontologists adam yates and anne warren produced a revised phylogeny of more derived temnospondyls naming several new clades two major clades were euskelia and limnarchia euskelia includes the temnospondyls that were once called rhachitomes and includes two subfamilies the dissorophoidea and the eryopoidea dissorophoids include small mostly terrestrial temnospondyls that may be the ancestors of modern amphibians eryopoids include larger temnospondyls like eryops the second major clade limnarchia includes most mesozoic temnospondyls as well as some permian groups within limnarchia are the superfamily archegosauroidea and the most derived temnospondyls the stereospondyls
yates and warren also named dvinosauria a clade of small aquatic temnospondyls from the carboniferous permian and triassic they placed dvinosauria within limnarchia but more recent studies disagree on their position for example a 2007 study places them even more basal than euskelians while a 2008 study keeps them as basal limnarchians
within stereospondyli yates and warren erected two major clades capitosauria and trematosauria capitosaurs include large semiaquatic temnospondyls like mastodonsaurus with flat heads and eyes near the back of the skull trematosaurs include a diversity of temnospondyls including large marine trematosauroids aquatic plagiosaurs brachyopoids that survived into the cretaceous and metoposauroids with eyes near the front of their heads in 2000 paleontologists rainer schoch and andrew milner named a third major clade of stereospondyls the rhytidostea this group included more primitive stereospondyls that could not be placed in either capitosauria or trematosauria and included groups like lydekkerinidae rhytidosteidae and brachyopoidea while capitosauria and trematosauria are still widely used rhytidostea is not often supported as a true clade in recent analyses rhytidosteids and brachyopoids are now grouped with trematosaurians but lydekkerinids are still considered to be a primitive family of stereospondyls
a new phylogeny of temnospondyls was offered by paleontologist rainer schoch in 2013 it supported many of the clades that were found by yates and warren but it did not find support for their division of derived stereospondyls into euskelia and limnarchia eryopids were found to be more closely related to stereospondyls than to dissorophoids which were grouped with dvinosaurs the clade including eryopidae and stereospondylomorpha was named eryopiformes in addition schoch named the clade containing all temnospondyls except edopoids eutemnospondyli and reinstated the name rhachitomi for the clade containing all temnospondyls except edopoids and dendrerpetontids below is the cladogram from schoch's analysis
modern amphibians frogs salamanders and caecilians are classified in lissamphibia lissamphibians appear to have arisen in the permian molecular clock estimates place the first lissamphibian in the late carboniferous but the first member of batrachia frogs and salamanders but not caecilians is estimated to have appeared in the middle permian using the same technique using fossil evidence there are three main theories for the origin of modern amphibians
one is that they evolved from dissorophoid temnospondyls another is that they evolved from lepospondyls most likely the lysorophians a third hypothesis is that caecilians descended from lepospondyls and frogs and salamanders evolved from dissorophoids
recently the theory that temnospondyls were the ancestors of all lissamphibians has gained wide support the skull morphology of some small temnospondyls has been compared to those of modern frogs and salamanders but the presence of bicuspid pedicellate teeth in small paedomorphic or immature temnospondyls has been cited as the most convincing argument in favor of the temnospondyl origin of lissamphibians seen in lissamphibians and many dissorophoid temnospondyls pedicellate teeth have calcified tips and bases during the development of most tetrapods teeth begin to calcify at their tips calcification normally proceeds downward to the base of the tooth but calcification from the tip stops abruptly in pedicellate teeth calcification resumes at the base leaving an area in the center of the tooth uncalcified this pattern is seen in living amphibians and fossils
the dissorophoid family amphibamidae is thought to be most closely related to lissamphibia in 2008 an amphibamid called gerobatrachus hottoni was named from texas and was nicknamed the frogamander for its frog-like head and salamander-like body it was thought to be the most closely related temnospondyl to lissamphibians and was placed as the sister taxon of the group in a phylogenetic analysis another species of amphibamid called doleserpeton annectens is now thought to be even more closely related to lissamphibians unlike gerobatrachus doleserpeton was known since 1969 and the presence of pedicellate teeth in its jaws has led some paleontologists to conclude soon after its naming that it was a relative of modern amphibians it was first described as a protolissamphibian and the specific name annectens means connecting in reference to its inferred transitional position between temnospondyls and lissamphibians the structure of its tympanum a disk-like membrane that functions like an ear drum is similar to that of frogs and has also been used as evidence for a close relationship other features including the shape of the palate and the back of the skull the short ribs and the smooth skull surface also point to it being a closer relative of lissamphibians than is gerobatrachus below is a cladogram modified from sigurdsen and bolt 2010 showing the relationships of gerobatrachus doleserpeton and lissamphibia
although the earliest temnospondyls were primarily semiaquatic they had the ability to feed on land later eryopoids and dissorophoids some well adapted to terrestrial life also fed on land some eryopoids became better adapted toward life in water and shifted their diets toward aquatic organisms the first primarily aquatic feeders were archegosaurs in the permian trematosaurs and capitosaurs became independently aquatic and also returned to this type of feeding
most aquatic stereospondyls have flattened heads when feeding they probably opened their mouths by lifting their skulls instead of lowering their lower jaws the jaw mechanics of the plagiosaurid gerrothorax is well known and is one of the most highly adapted gerrothorax is thought to have lifted its skull to around 50 ° above horizontal through the flexing of the atlanto-occipital joint between the occipital condyles of the skull and the atlas vertebra of the neck as the skull is raised the quadrate bone pushes forward and causes the lower jaw to protrude outward other stereospondyls probably also lifted their skulls but they are not as well adapted for such movement d.m.s. watson was the first to suggest skull lifting as a means of feeding in temnospondyls he envisioned that mastodonsaurus a much larger temnospondyl than gerrothorax was able to make the same movement paleontologist a.l. panchen also supported the idea in 1959 suggesting that batrachosuchus also fed in this way at the time it was thought that these temnospondyls lifted their heads with strong jaw muscles but it is now thought that they used larger muscles in the neck that were attached to the large pectoral girdle plagiosuchus a close relative of gerrothorax also has a hyobranchial skeleton that muscles may have attached to plagiosuchus has very small teeth and a large area for muscle attachment behind the skull suggesting that it could suction feed by rapidly opening its mouth
unlike semiaquatic temnospondyls terrestrial temnospondyls have skulls that are adapted for biting land-living prey the sutures between the bones of the skull in the dissorophoid phonerpeton are able to withstand a high degree of compression compressive forces would have been experienced when biting down on prey earlier aquatic tetrapods and tetrapod ancestors differ from temnospondyls like phonerpeton in that their skulls were also built to withstand tension this tension would have been experienced during suction feeding underwater temnospondyls like phonerpeton were among the first tetrapods that were almost exclusively terrestrial and fed by biting
temnospondyls like all amphibians reproduced in aquatic environments most temnospondyls probably reproduced through external fertilization like most living frogs female temnospondyls would have laid masses of eggs in water while males released sperm to fertilize them several fossils were described from the early permian of texas in 1998 that may be egg masses of dissorophoid temnospondyls they were the first known fossils of amphibian eggs the fossils consist of small disks with thin membranes that are probably vitelline membranes and halo-like areas surrounding them that are most likely mucous coatings they are attached to plant fossils suggesting that these temnospondyls laid eggs on aquatic plants much like modern frogs the mucous membranes show that the eggs were laid by amphibians not fish their eggs lack mucous but the type of amphibian that laid them cannot be known because no body fossils are preserved with the eggs the eggs are thought to be from dissorophoids because they are likely to be close relatives of modern amphibians and probably had similar reproductive strategies they are also the most common amphibians from the deposit in which the eggs were found
one temnospondyl the dvinosaur trimerorhachis may have brooded young in an area between the gills called the pharyngeal pouch small bones belonging to younger trimerorhachis individuals have been found in these pouches the living darwin's frog is also a mouth brooder and would be the closest modern analogue to trimerorhachis if it cared for its young in this way an alternative possibility is that trimerorhachis was cannibalistic eating its young like many amphibians do today if this was the case the bones of these smaller individuals were originally located in the throat and were pushed into the pharyngeal pouch as the animal fossilized
body impressions of early carboniferous temnospondyls from pennsylvania suggest that some terrestrial temnospondyls mated on land like some modern amphibians they reproduced through internal fertilization rather than mating in water the presence of three individuals in one block of sandstone shows that the temnospondyls were gregarious the head of one individual rests under the tail of another in what may be a courtship display internal fertilization and similar courtship behavior are seen in modern salamanders
while most types of temnospondyls are distinguished on the basis of features in mature specimens several are known from juvenile and larval specimens metamorphosis is seen in dissorophoids eryopids and zatrachydids with aquatic larvae developing into adults capable of living on land several types of dissorophoids do not fully metamorphose but retain features of juveniles such as gills and small body size in what is known as neoteny dvinosaurians and the plagiosaurid gerrothorax were also neotenic because they retained gills but they are only known from adult specimens
temnospondyl larvae are often distinguished by poorly developed bones and the presence of a hyobranchial apparatus a series of bones that gills would attach to in life however some fully mature temnospondyls also possess hyobranchial bones but did not have external gills a dense covering of scales is also seen in larvae and adults major body changes occur in metamorphosis including the reshaping and strengthening of skull bones the thickening of postcranial bones and an increase in body size
temnospondyls like sclerocephalus are known from both large adult specimens and small larvae showing an extreme change in body shape in these species the shape and proportions of skull bones change in the early stages of development the ornamentation on the surface of the skull roof also develops at this time small regularly spaced pits are the first to form followed by larger ridges as development continues the external gills disappear small teeth that once covered the palate are lost the postcranial skeleton does not develop at the same rate as the skull with ossification the replacement of cartilage by bone happening more slowly vertebrae and limb bones are poorly developed ribs and fingers are absent in the early stages and the scapulocoracoid and ischium are entirely absent through most of development once maturity is reached most bones have fully formed and growth rate slows the bones of some temnospondyls like dutuitosaurus show growth marks possibly an indication that growth rate varied with the change in seasons fossils of temnospondyls like metoposaurus and cheliderpeton show that individuals grew larger past maturity the oldest individuals usually have more pitting on their skulls with deeper sulci
one group of temnospondyls the branchiosauridae is also known from larval specimens branchiosaurids like branchiosaurus and apateon are represented by many fossils preserving skin and external gills an entire growth series is exhibited in the wide range of sizes among specimens but the lack of terrestrially adapted adult forms suggests that these temnospondyls were neotenic unlike other temnospondyls their postcranial skeletons developed quickly but were still partly cartilaginous when fully mature adults likely had an aquatic lifestyle similar to juveniles recently large specimens of apateon gracilis were described with adaptations toward a terrestrial lifestyle indicating that not all branchiosaurs were neotenic
while most temnospondyls are aquatic in early stages of life most metoposaurids appear to have been terrestrial in their juvenile stage like other mesozoic temnospondyls adult metoposaurids were adapted to a semiaquatic lifestyle their bones are not highly developed for movement on land the cross-sectional thickness of limb bones in adult metoposaurids shows that they could not withstand the stress of terrestrial locomotion juvenile individuals have bones that are thick enough to withstand this stress and could probably move about on land to maintain a terrestrial lifestyle a temnospondyl's limb bones would have to thicken with positive allometry meaning that they would grow at a greater rate than the rest of the body this is not the case in metoposaurids meaning that as their bodies grew larger they became less adapted toward a terrestrial lifestyle
temnospondyls and other early tetrapods have rounded otic notches in the back of the skull that project into the cheek region in life the otic notch would have been covered by a membrane called the tympanum which is seen as a disk-like area in living frogs the tympanum is involved in hearing and is similar to the ear drum of more advanced tetrapods it was traditionally thought that the tympanum developed very early in tetrapod evolution as a hearing organ and progressed to form the ear drum of amniotes thus temnospondyls possessed a hearing system supposedly ancestral to that of living amphibians and reptiles
frogs and all other living tetrapods have a rod-like bone called the stapes that aids in hearing by transferring vibrations from the ear drum — or homologous tympanum — to the inner ear temnospondyls also have a stapes which projects into the otic cavity the stapes likely evolved from the hyomandibula of lobe-finned fishes the positioning of the stapes and the shape of the otic region suggests that the tympani of temnospondyls and frogs are homologous but the tympani of these amphibians are no longer considered homologous with the hearing systems of reptiles birds and mammals therefore ear structures in temnospondyls were not ancestral to those of all other tetrapods
the ability of the tympanum and stapes to effectively transmit vibrations is called impedance matching early tetrapods like temnospondyls have thick stapes with poor impedance matching so it is now thought that they were not used for hearing instead these thick stapes may have functioned to support the tissue that covers the otic notch early temnospondyls like dendrerpeton could not hear airborne sound but would have been able to detect vibration in the ground later temnospondyls like doleserpeton had otic regions adapted to hearing doleserpeton has a structure in the inner ear called the perilymphatic duct which is also seen in frogs and is associated with hearing its stapes is also a better transmitter of sound the hearing system of doleserpeton and related temnospondyls was able to detect airborne sound and may have been ancestral to that of living amphibians
osbert de bayeux floruit 1121 to 1184 was a medieval english cleric and archdeacon in the diocese of york a relative of thurstan the archbishop of york osbert probably owed his ecclesiastical positions to this relative after thurstan's death osbert was opposed to one of the candidates for the archbishopric william fitzherbert and worked to secure fitzherbert's deposition and replacement by henry murdac after murdac's death in 1153 osbert tried to prevent the return of fitzherbert but these attempts were unsuccessful when fitzherbert died suddenly in 1154 osbert was accused of murdering the newly returned archbishop although he was never convicted of the murder in either a secular or an ecclesiastical court he was stripped of his clerical status and became a layman before 1158 he died after 1184 perhaps even after 1194
osbert was first mentioned in the historical record between 1121 and 1128 when he appears in a charter which although likely a forgery probably contains an authentic witness list this document lists him as osbert archdeacon which means that he probably held the archdeaconry of richmond he was the nephew of thurstan who was archbishop of york from 1114 to 1140 presumably he owed his position as archdeacon to his uncle and was probably appointed at a young age a charter of thurstan's dating to around 1138 names osbert explicitly as thurstan's nephew
osbert was opposed to the election of william fitzherbert as archbishop of york and supported william's rival and successor henry murdac although he remained a supporter of murdac after 1147 he did oppose murdac's interventions in selby abbey where murdac had deposed one abbot and appointed another in 1153 osbert deposed murdac's choice as abbot of selby and appointed another abbot originally osbert had supported elias paynel murdac's choice for abbot but then changed his stance and helped with the deposition
after murdac's death in 1153 osbert was opposed to william's return as archbishop but was unsuccessful in his attempts to prevent william's reappointment william died a week after his return to york however and osbert along with robert of ghent the dean of york secured the quick election of the new archbishop roger de pont l 'évêque
osbert was accused of murdering william specifically by poisoning him through the communion chalice a fellow cleric symphorian who had been a chaplain of the deceased archbishop brought murder charges against osbert symphorian obtained a hearing on the charges at a royal council presided over by king stephen of england at michaelmas in 1154 but stephen's subsequent death prevented a resolution osbert attempted to have the trial switched to an ecclesiastical court and was supported in his efforts by archbishop theobald of canterbury a trial was finally held in 1156 and osbert's accuser did not produce any witnesses but osbert was unable to prove his innocence prompting the transfer of the case to a papal court no record of any judgment exists but osbert apparently appeared before two popes adrian iv and alexander iii a further appeal to the papal court was referred to papal judges-delegate between 1175 and 1180
the case attracted commentary by two contemporary writers john of salisbury who was a secretary for theobald added information about osbert in a letter to alexander iii on unrelated business in the section of the letter john pointed out to the pope that no matter what others might say about osbert he had failed to secure other clergy willing to swear that he was innocent another contemporary gilbert foliot who was bishop of hereford wrote to the pope to remind him that although osbert's accuser had offered to prove his accusations by undergoing a trial by ordeal this was essentially meaningless since canon law forbade the clergy from the ordeal
osbert was no longer archdeacon by 1158 as his successor is attested by that point osbert however continued to call himself archdeacon even though he held land as a secular lord including lands in lacy and skipton he also acted as a steward for hugh de tilly osbert was still alive in 1184 as he was a witness to a document at york then and may have been alive as late as 1194 when hugh bardulf was responsible for the farm of osbert's lands as the record of that transaction in the escheat roll is unclear if osbert was alive at that time or dead
osbert had two sons william de bayeux and turstin de baius osbert was a benefactor to a number of monasteries including drax priory pontefract priory and gisborough priory he also gave land to a hospital in york and to the templars and hospitallers
the dvorak technique developed between 1969 and 1984 by vernon dvorak is a widely used system to estimate tropical cyclone intensity which includes tropical depression tropical storm and hurricane typhoon intense tropical cyclone intensities based solely on visible and infrared satellite images within the dvorak satellite strength estimate for tropical cyclones there are several visual patterns that a cyclone may take on which define the upper and lower bounds on its intensity the primary patterns used are curved band pattern t1.0-t4.5 shear pattern t1.5-t3.5 central dense overcast cdo pattern t2.5-t5.0 central cold cover ccc pattern banding eye pattern t4.0-t4.5 and eye pattern t4.5 t8.0
both the central dense overcast and embedded eye pattern use the size of the cdo the cdo pattern intensities start at t2.5 equivalent to minimal tropical storm intensity 40 mph 65 km h the shape of the central dense overcast is also considered the eye pattern utilizes the coldness of the cloud tops within the surrounding mass of thunderstorms and contrasts it with the temperature within the eye itself the larger the temperature difference is the stronger the tropical cyclone once a pattern is identified the storm features such as length and curvature of banding features are further analyzed to arrive at a particular t-number the ccc pattern indicates little development is occurring despite the cold cloud tops associated with the quickly evolving feature
several agencies issue dvorak intensity numbers for tropical cyclones and their precursors including the national hurricane center's tropical analysis and forecast branch tafb the noaa nesdis satellite analysis branch sab and the joint typhoon warning center at the naval meteorology and oceanography command in pearl harbor hawaii
the initial development of this technique occurred in 1969 by vernon dvorak using satellite pictures of tropical cyclones within the northwest pacific ocean the system as it was initially conceived involved pattern matching of cloud features with a development and decay model as the technique matured through the 1970s and 1980s measurement of cloud features became dominant in defining tropical cyclone intensity and central pressure of the tropical cyclone's low-pressure area use of infrared satellite imagery led to a more objective assessment of the strength of tropical cyclones with eyes using the cloud top temperatures within the eyewall and contrasting them with the warm temperatures within the eye itself constraints on short term intensity change are used less frequently than they were back in the 1970s and 1980s the central pressures assigned to tropical cyclones have required modification as the original estimates were 5-10 hpa 0.15-0.29 inhg too low in the atlantic and up to 20 hpa 0.59 inhg too high in the northwest pacific this led to the development of a separate wind-pressure relationship for the northwest pacific devised by atkinson and holliday in 1975 then modified in 1977
as human analysts using the technique lead to subjective biases efforts have been made to make more objective estimates using computer programs which have been aided by higher-resolution satellite imagery and more powerful computers since tropical cyclone satellite patterns can fluctuate over time automated techniques use a six-hour averaging period to lead to more reliable intensity estimates development of the objective dvorak technique began in 1998 which performed best with tropical cyclones that had eyes of hurricane or typhoon strength it still required a manual center placement keeping some subjectivity within the process by 2004 an advanced objective dvorak technique was developed which utilized banding features for systems below hurricane intensity and to objectively determine the tropical cyclone's center a central pressure bias was uncovered in 2004 relating to the slope of the tropopause and cloud top temperatures which change with latitude that helped improve central pressure estimates within the objective technique
in a developing cyclone the technique takes advantage of the fact that cyclones of similar intensity tend to have certain characteristic features and as they strengthen they tend to change in appearance in a predictable manner the structure and organization of the tropical cyclone are tracked over 24 hours to determine if the storm has weakened maintained its intensity or strengthened various central cloud and banding features are compared with templates that show typical storm patterns and their associated intensity if infrared satellite imagery is available for a cyclone with a visible eye pattern then the technique utilizes the difference between the temperature of the warm eye and the surrounding cold cloud tops to determine intensity colder cloud tops generally indicate a more intense storm in each case a t-number an abbreviation for tropical number and a current intensity ci value are assigned to the storm these measurements range between 1 minimum intensity and 8 maximum intensity the t-number and ci value are the same except for weakening storms in which case the ci is higher for weakening systems the ci is held as the tropical cyclone intensity for 12 hours though research from the national hurricane center indicates that six hours is more reasonable the table at right shows the approximate surface wind speed and sea level pressure that corresponds to a given t-number the amount a tropical cyclone can change in strength per 24 ‑ hour period is limited to 2.5 t-numbers per day
within the dvorak satellite strength estimate for tropical cyclones there are several visual patterns that a cyclone may take on which define the upper and lower bounds on its intensity the primary patterns used are curved band pattern t1.0-t4.5 shear pattern t1.5-t3.5 central dense overcast cdo pattern t2.5-t5.0 banding eye pattern t4.0-t4.5 eye pattern t4.5 t8.0 and central cold cover ccc pattern both the central dense overcast and embedded eye pattern utilize the size of the cdo the cdo pattern intensities start at t2.5 equivalent to minimal tropical storm intensity 40 miles per hour 64 km h the shape of the central dense overcast is also considered the farther the center is tucked into the cdo the stronger it is deemed tropical cyclones with maximum sustained winds between 65 miles per hour 105 km h and 100 miles per hour 160 km h can have their center of circulations obscured by cloudiness within visible and infrared satellite imagery which makes diagnosis of their intensity a challenge
the ccc pattern with its large and quickly developing mass of thick cirrus clouds spreading out from an area of convection near a tropical cyclone center within a short time frame indicates little development when it develops rainbands and cloud lines around the tropical cyclone weaken and the thick cloud shield obscures the circulation center while it resembles a cdo pattern it is rarely seen
the eye pattern utilizes the coldness of the cloud tops within the surrounding mass of thunderstorms and contrasts it with the temperature within the eye itself the larger the temperature difference is the stronger the tropical cyclone winds within tropical cyclones can also be estimated by tracking features within the cdo using rapid scan geostationary satellite imagery whose pictures are taken minutes apart rather than every half-hour
once a pattern is identified the storm features such as length and curvature of banding features are further analyzed to arrive at a particular t-number
several agencies issue dvorak intensity numbers for tropical cyclones and their precursors these include the national hurricane center's tropical analysis and forecast branch tafb the national oceanic and atmospheric administration's satellite analysis branch sab and the joint typhoon warning center at the naval pacific meteorology and oceanography center in pearl harbor hawaii
the national hurricane center will often quote dvorak t-numbers in their tropical cyclone products the following example is from discussion number 3 of tropical depression 24 eventually hurricane wilma of the 2005 atlantic hurricane season
both tafb and sab came in with a dvorak satellite intensity estimate of t2.5 35 kt however ... oftentimes the surface wind field of large developing low pressure systems like this one will lag about 12 hours behind the satellite signature therefore ... the initial intensity has only been increased to 30 kt
note that in this case the dvorak t-number in this case t2.5 was simply used as a guide but other factors determined how the nhc decided to set the system's intensity
the cooperative institute for meteorological satellite studies cimss at the university of wisconsin–madison has developed the objective dvorak technique odt this is a modified version of the dvorak technique which uses computer algorithms rather than subjective human interpretation to arrive at a ci number this is generally not implemented for tropical depressions or weak tropical storms the china meteorological agency cma is expected to start using the standard 1984 version of dvorak in the near future the indian meteorological department imd prefers using visible satellite imagery over infrared imagery due to a perceived high bias in estimates derived from infrared imagery during the early morning hours of convective maximum the japan meteorological agency jma uses the infrared version of dvorak over the visible imagery version hong kong observatory and jma continue to utilize dvorak after tropical cyclone landfall various centers hold on to the maximum current intensity for 6–12 hours though this rule is broken when rapid weakening is obvious
citizen science site cyclone center uses a modified version of the dvorak technique to categorize post-1970 tropical weather

the most significant benefit of the use of the technique is that it has provided a more complete history of tropical cyclone intensity in areas where aircraft reconnaissance is neither possible nor routinely available intensity estimates of maximum sustained wind are currently within 5 miles per hour 8.0 km h of what aircraft are able to measure half of the time though the assignment of intensity of systems with strengths between moderate tropical-storm force 60 miles per hour 97 km h and weak hurricane- or typhoon-force 100 miles per hour 160 km h is the least certain its overall precision has not always been true as refinements in the technique led to intensity changes between 1972 and 1977 of up to 20 miles per hour 32 km h the method is internally consistent in that it constrains rapid increases or decreases in tropical cyclone intensity some tropical cyclones fluctuate in strength more than the 2.5 t numbers per day limit allowed by the rule which can work to the technique's disadvantage and has led to occasional abandonment of the constraints since the 1980s systems with small eyes near the limb or edge of a satellite image can be biased too weakly using the technique which can be resolved through use of polar-orbiting satellite imagery subtropical cyclone intensity cannot be determined using dvorak which led to the development of the hebert-poteat technique in 1975 cyclones undergoing extratropical transition losing their thunderstorm activity see their intensities underestimated using the dvorak technique this led to the development of the miller and lander extratropical transition technique which can be used under these circumstances
new york state route 31b ny 31b was a state highway in central new york in the united states it served as a connector between ny 31 its parent route in the cayuga county village of weedsport and ny 5 in the onondaga county town of elbridge ny 31b was assigned c 1933 replacing new york state route 293 a route assigned as part of the 1930 renumbering of state highways in new york the ny 31b designation was removed in 1980 and replaced by county route 31b cr 31b in cayuga county and cr 99 in onondaga county

kershaw's pitching style relies on deception he keeps the ball hidden so that it is hard for the batter to pick up the ball and has a consistent overhand delivery on all of his pitches out of the windup kershaw lowers his right foot vertically with a slight pause before moving it forward toward the plate the motion was described during the 2015 national league division series as a kickstand move drawing comparison with one setting a kickstand on a bicycle out of the stretch he uses a slide step as it makes it difficult for the base runner at first base to get a read on him he has stated many times that he has modeled his pitching mechanics after his favorite pitcher growing up roger clemens

according to many teammates kershaw is a noted perfectionist a.j. ellis describes his preparation and perfectionism during bullpens before each start
three fastballs when i 'm standing up i sit and three fastballs down the middle then three fastballs either side three changeups away fastball inside three curveballs to the middle fastball inside three sliders to the middle then he goes to the stretch position two fastballs inside two fastballs away two changeups one fastball inside two curveballs one fastball inside two sliders back to the windup and one fastball inside one fastball away thirty-four pitches in all

head vi is an oil-on-canvas painting by the irish-born english figurative artist francis bacon the last of six panels making up his 1949 head series it shows a bust view of a single figure modeled on diego velázquez's portrait of innocent x. bacon applies forceful expressive brush strokes and places the figure within a glass cage structure behind curtain-like drapery this gives the effect of a man trapped and suffocated by his surroundings screaming into an airless void
head vi was the first of bacon's paintings to reference velázquez whose portrait of pope innocent x haunted him throughout his career and inspired his series of screaming popes a loose series of which there are around 45 surviving individual works head vi contains many motifs that were to reappear in bacon's work the hanging object which may be a light switch or curtain tassel can be found even in his late paintings the geometric cage is a motif that appears as late as his 1985–86 masterpiece study for a self-portrait — triptych
head vi was first exhibited in november 1949 at the hanover gallery in london in a showing organised by one of the artist's early champions erica brausen at the time bacon was a highly controversial but respected artist best known for his 1944 three studies for figures at the base of a crucifixion which made him the enfant terrible of british art head vi drew a mixed reaction from art critics john russell later bacon's biographer at the time dismissed it as a cross between an alligator shorn of its jaws and an accountant in pince-nez who has come to a bad end in 1989 lawrence gowing wrote that the shock of the picture when it was seen with a whole series of heads ... was indescribable it was everything unpardonable the paradoxical appearance at once of pastiche and iconoclasm was indeed one of bacon's most original strokes art critic and curator david sylvester described it as a seminal piece from bacon's unusually productive 1949–50 period and one of bacon's finest popes
bacon's output is characterised by sequences of images he told sylvester that his imagination was stimulated by sequences and that images breed other images in me his series were not always planned or painted in sequence sometimes paintings are grouped for convenience but vary in execution and tone the idea for the head series came after he returned penniless late in 1948 from a stay in tangier in the previous three years he had been unable to find a voice the last surviving canvas from this period is his painting 1946 although he continued to paint he was a ruthless self critic given to slashing canvases with blades and no works survive from between 1947 and the winter of 1948 gallerist erica brausen offered bacon the opportunity of a solo show for the opening of her new hanover gallery he agreed but had nothing in reserve to hang in following years brausen became perhaps the most important of bacon's early champions she arranged this showing — his debut solo exhibition — publicised him widely and organised viewings for international buyers
already 40 years old bacon viewed the exhibition as his last chance and applied himself to the task with determination because he had destroyed all his out of the last three years he had little choice but to present new works he did not have a grand plan when he agreed to the show but eventually found themes that interested him in his head i of the previous year and executed five progressively stronger variants in the final weeks before the november exhibition completing the series barely in time for the opening
the paintings depict isolated figures enclosed in spaces that are undefined overwhelmingly claustrophobic reductive and eerie coming early in bacon's career they are uneven in quality but show a clear progression especially in how they utilise and present ideas he was still clearly developing and coming to terms with head i actually begun in the winter of 1948 and head ii show formless pieces of flesh that broadly resemble human heads they have half-open eyes and a pharynx though it is positioned much higher than would be expected in a human heads iii iv and v show fully formed busts recognisable as men and are characterised by a haunted atmosphere these two broad ideas coalesce in head vi which is as physiologically tortured as the first two paintings and as spectral as the middle three in head vi the figure has developed and is now shown wearing vestments the first indication in bacon's work of the influence of velázquez while the focus has become the open mouth and the study of the human scream
bacon said that chance played a significant role in his work and that he often approached a canvas without having a clear idea of what might emerge this was especially the case in the mid to late 1940s a period when he was drinking heavily and spending most nights in soho casinos and poker rooms the following morning he would often approach his canvas in a bad mood of drinking ... under tremendous hangovers and drink i sometimes hardly knew what i was doing he incorporated his appetite for chance into his work an image often would morph mid-way through into something quite different from what he had first intended he actively sought out this freedom and felt it crucial to his progression as an artist to him lifestyle and art were intertwined he said that perhaps the drink helped me to be a bit freer this is very evident in the 1949 series which began as a rather morbid study of a collapsed head but evolved over the six surviving panels into a reworking of velázquez masterpieces and arrived at an image that was to preoccupy bacon for the subsequent 20 years
the series marks bacon's first attempt at depicting lone figures in rooms for him the key aspect was that it appeared that the subject felt isolated unobserved and had abandoned the need to present an outward face he believed that under these circumstances all pretence falls away and the social being becomes the sum of its neuroses which bacon attempted to convey by reducing the subject to its bare-bones features a mouth ears eyes a jaw according to russell the view out front ceases to be the only one and our person is suddenly adrift fragmented and subject to strange mutation russell observed that while the depiction of figures in rooms is common through all eras of painting the figures are always posed and usually seemingly aware that they are being portrayed this conceit is abandoned in bacon's series
head i completed late in 1948 is considered more successful than head ii although it is well-regarded critically head ii is seen as something of a creative cul-de-sac while heads iii iv and v are usually considered as merely intermediate steps towards head vi it is exceptional in bacon's oeuvre that works of their relative poor quality survive he was ruthlessly self-critical and often slashed or abandoned canvasses before they were completed when pressed again by brausen in 1953 to produce works for a new york show that she had been publicising for a year he was full of doubt and destroyed most of what he had been working on including several other popes
brausen commissioned another showing to be held in 1950 for which bacon painted three large popes modelled on velázquez's portrait the gallery advertised the show as francis bacon three studies from the painting of innocent x by velázquez but in the end bacon was dissatisfied with the works and destroyed them before the show opened
the figure is clearly identifiable as a pope from his clothing it seems trapped and isolated within the outlines of an abstract three-dimensional glass cage this framing device described by sylvester as a space-frame was to feature heavily throughout the artist's career a cord hangs from the upper edge of the glass case falling just in front of the pope's face and partially covering his eyes it is too indistinctly drawn to identify with certainty but given the presence of similar objects in bacon's later works may be either the end of a hanging light switch or the tassel of a curtain the hanging cord was to become a signature for the artist apart from its symbolic meaning it has a compositional function framing the painting with a further set of vertical lines such an object reappears most prominently in the centre panel of his 1973 triptych may–june 1973 where it is clearly a dangling light bulb for bacon these elements were intended to make the figure waver in and out of sight for the viewer alluding to the fact that bulbs can be on or off curtains open or closed
the figure's mouth is opened wide as if screaming an expression bacon took from a still he kept of the nurse screaming in sergei eisenstein's odessa steps massacre sequence in his 1925 silent film battleship potemkin in 1984 the broadcaster melvyn bragg asked bacon about the still and observed that in his earlier career the artist seemed preoccupied with the physicality of the human mouth bacon replied i had always thought that i would be able to make the mouth with all the beauty of a monet landscape though i never succeeded in doing so when bragg asked why he thought he had failed bacon said it should be all much more colour should have got more of the interior of the mouth with all the colours of the interior of the mouth but i didn 't happen to get it his interest in the mouth was further stimulated by a medical textbook of diseased oral cavities bought in a second-hand bookshop kept in his studio and to which he often referred to
the glass cage might imply a vacuum that the figure's voice is unable to escape as if it is screaming in silence rueful later in life bacon said that he had wanted to paint the scream more than the horror i think if i had really thought about what causes somebody to really scream it would have made the scream ... more successful the work evokes memories of the second world war the glass enclosure of his 1949 chicago study for a portrait is often seen as prophesying photographs of adolf eichmann 1961 trial before a jerusalem district court when he was held within a similar cage bacon strongly resisted literal comparisons though and stated that he used the device so he could frame and really see the image–for no other reason i know it's been interpreted as being many other things other critics saw similarities between the glass case and the radio booths of late 1930s broadcasters who warned against the impending calamity denis farr notes that bacon was sympathetic to george orwell and referred in interviews to orwellian shouting voices ... and trembling hands ... convey ing the harsh atmosphere of an interrogation
the so-called space frame had already been used by alberto giacometti in the 1930s and the two artists became friends in the 1960s however giacometti had by 1949 used it only in surrealist contexts before bacon's adaption and in turn influenced his use in the cage of 1950 a similar two dimensional construct is found in henry moore's works notably his maguette for king and queen constructed three years after bacon's head it is difficult to untangle how these artists influenced and informed each other what is notable is that bacon continued to use the motif with intervals until the end of his life sylvester suggests his finest example is the 1970 three studies of the male back
the full-length golden curtain-like folds painted in heavy brush strokes are in part influenced by degas but also similar to titian's 1558 portrait of cardinal filippo archinto bacon adapts the old master's device to isolate and distance the sitter from the viewer the black ground-paint is visible through the folds making the separation all the more affecting bacon had already used similar forms in his chicago panel and they were to become a feature of his most acclaimed 1950s works especially in his screaming popes he became fascinated with the veil or curtain as a motif in painting and collected many reproductions of works by titian and degas in which it is employed he had begun his career as an interior decorator and designer of furniture and rugs in the mid-1930s and later said that he liked rooms hung all round with just curtains hung in even folds veils or curtains appear in bacon's earliest works notably the 1949 study from the human body always in portraits and always in front of rather than behind the figure
head vi is closely modelled on velázquez's c 1650 portrait of innocent x today in the doria pamphilj gallery rome bacon cautiously avoided seeing the original even when he spent three months in rome in 1954 critics speculate he was afraid of being disappointed or thought that an intimate knowledge of the painting would dull his imagination yet his fascination was all-consuming and he reproduced variants of it obsessively for almost two decades an examination and homage described as without parallel in the history of art bacon's approach differs to velázquez's in a number of ways both artists were expressive yet bacon's broad brush-strokes and freedom with paint contrast with velázquez's tight and controlled treatment he adapts velázquez's positioning of the pope to place him above the viewer's point of view elevating and distancing him this was already a common technique in commercial promotional photography but in bacon's hands schmied argues the angle places the pope on a kind of stage for the viewer to coldly observe
although bacon revered velázquez's portrait he did not try and reproduce the earlier painting in interviews he said that he saw flaws in velázquez's work and that he viewed that social structure and order as according to art historian wieland schmied obsolete and decayed bacon's approach was to elevate his subject so he could knock him down again thereby making a sly comment on the treatment of royalty in both old master and contemporary painting yet velázquez's influence is apparent in many aspects of the painting the sitter's pose closely echoes the original as does the violet and white colouring of his cope which is built up through broad thick brush-strokes the influence can be further seen in the gold-coloured ornaments on the back of the seat that extend on both sides of the figure art historian armin zweite describes the work as a mixture of reverence and subversion that pays tribute to velázquez while at the same time deconstructs his painting
sylvester detects the influence of late works by titian in other aspects especially in the deep and rich colouring velázquez's portrayals of philip iv and agrees with identification of pastels of edgar degas as a source he believes bacon borrowed from degas the use of parallel heavy folds to create the illusion of what degas described as shuttering as seen in the earlier artist's after the bath woman drying herself sylvester makes a further direct link between the folds and the transparent veil in titian's portrait of cardinal filippo archinto he believes the folds serve to push the viewer back creating a distance from the subject an effect he sees as similar to the separation between and orchestra and setting others view the folds as more closely resembling the bars of a prison sylvester describes them as an accentuation of background verticals into stripes that are made to appear as if they pass through the sitter in his interviews with francis bacon series of books he asked bacon why he found the effect so poignant the artist replied well it means that the sensation doesn 't come straight out at you but slides slowly and gently through the gaps
when asked why he was compelled to revisit the velázquez so often bacon replied that he had nothing against popes per se but merely sought an excuse to use these colours and you can 't give ordinary clothes that purple colour without getting into a sort of false fauve manner schmied sees head vi as a reaction against velázquez and a commentary on how the papacy is obsolete and decayed with a pope resistant to both modernisation and secularisation to him the figure seems to resist the maltreatment of image and tries to halt the impending collapse of the established work order he screams and grimaces clutching at arms of his throne sylvester notes that bacon was impressed by picasso's figuration and handling of paint especially in picasso's 1930s works and suggests that the white blobs around the pope's cape may be influenced by the 1913 woman in a slip seated in an armchair
when bacon undertook the series late in 1948 he was something of a two-hit wonder he had success in 1944 with three studies for figures at the base of a crucifixion and to a lesser extent with painting 1946 both of which were highly regarded but viewed as sensationalist the exhibition was a success and marked his critical breakthrough until then he had been highly regarded but capable of only occasional brilliance the full show established him in the minds of critics as according to michael peppiatt more of a force to be reckoned with in the contemporary scene while some found his images horrifying and unnerving they wrote about him all the same sealing his reputation as the enfant terrible of post-war british art the critic for the observer wrote the recent paintings ... horrifying as they are cannot be ignored technically they are superb and the masterly handling of large areas of pearly grey flushed with a sudden pink or green only makes me regret the more that the artist's gift should have been brought to subjects so esoteric
most critics focused on heads i and vi remarking favourably on the progression between the two while some found the inherent violence of the paintings distasteful brausen was a skilled publicist and turned the bad press into notoriety and brought bacon's work to national attention peppiatt notes that the exhibition showed bacon no longer needed sensationalist material to make an impact and was now capable of creating an intense emotional response through more subtle means and had found a way of presenting the human condition in the way he had sought by presenting his sitter in a vestigial setting a cage or behind a parted curtin ... the rest the most essential lay in the manipulation of the infinitely suggestive medium of oil paint after the showing bacon gradually became less the outsider with an occasional image of horrifying brilliance and more a force to be reckoned with on the contemporary scene his reputation and the value of his panels rose dramatically and after the showing he was sought after by european american and african collectors and galleries commanding prices as high as £ 400 for single works unusual for a contemporary british artist of the time
head vi was first exhibited at the hanover gallery london in 1949 it was acquired by the arts council's hayward gallery in 1952 the hayward has loaned it out a number of times since including for major retrospectives at the grand palais paris in 1971 and the hugh lane gallery dublin in 2000
in may 1996 the national gallery took on loan velázquez's innocent x portrait and hung it alongside four bacon paintings head vi pope i 1951 pope 1961 and pope 1965 peppiatt believes that bacon would have disapproved of such a showing with a work he considered one of the finest ever painted but writes that two including head vi stood up to it and even enhanced its authority as one of the most penetrating studies of human nature and human power
imagism was a movement in early 20th-century anglo-american poetry that favored precision of imagery and clear sharp language
imagism has been described as the most influential movement in english poetry since the activity of the pre-raphaelites as a poetic style it gave modernism its start in the early 20th century and is considered to be the first organized modernist literary movement in the english language imagism is sometimes viewed as'a succession of creative moments'rather than any continuous or sustained period of development rené taupin remarked that'it is more accurate to consider imagism not as a doctrine nor even as a poetic school but as the association of a few poets who were for a certain time in agreement on a small number of important principles'.
the imagists rejected the sentiment and discursiveness typical of much romantic and victorian poetry in contrast to their contemporaries the georgian poets who were generally content to work within that tradition in contrast imagism called for a return to what were seen as more classical values such as directness of presentation and economy of language as well as a willingness to experiment with non-traditional verse forms imagists use free verse
imagist publications appearing between 1914 and 1917 featured works by many of the most prominent modernist figures both in poetry and in other fields the imagist group was centered in london with members from great britain ireland and the united states somewhat unusually for the time a number of women writers were major imagist figures
a characteristic feature of imagism is its attempt to isolate a single image to reveal its essence this feature mirrors contemporary developments in avant-garde art especially cubism although imagism isolates objects through the use of what ezra pound called luminous details pound's ideogrammic method of juxtaposing concrete instances to express an abstraction is similar to cubism's manner of synthesizing multiple perspectives into a single image
well-known poets of the edwardian era of the 1890s such as alfred austin stephen phillips and william watson had been working very much in the shadow of tennyson producing weak imitations of the poetry of the victorian era they continued to work in this vein into the early years of the 20th century as the new century opened austin was still the serving british poet laureate a post which he held up to 1913 in the century's first decade poetry still had a large audience volumes of verse published in that time included thomas hardy's the dynasts christina rossetti's posthumous poetical works ernest dowson's poems george meredith's last poems robert service's ballads of a cheechako and john masefield's ballads and poems future nobel prize winner william butler yeats was devoting much of his energy to the abbey theatre and writing for the stage producing relatively little lyric poetry during this period in 1907 the nobel prize for literature was awarded to rudyard kipling
the origins of imagism are to be found in two poems autumn and a city sunset by t. e. hulme these were published in january 1909 by the poets'club in london in a booklet called for christmas mdccccviii hulme was a student of mathematics and philosophy he had been involved in the setting up of the club in 1908 and was its first secretary around the end of 1908 he presented his paper a lecture on modern poetry at one of the club's meetings writing in a. r. orage's magazine the new age the poet and critic f. s. flint a champion of free verse and modern french poetry was highly critical of the club and its publications from the ensuing debate hulme and flint became close friends in 1909 hulme left the poets'club and started meeting with flint and other poets in a new group which hulme referred to as the secession club they met at the eiffel tower restaurant in london's soho to discuss plans to reform contemporary poetry through free verse and the tanka and haiku and the removal of all unnecessary verbiage from poems the interest in japanese verse forms can be placed in a context of the late victorian and edwardian revival of interest in chinoiserie and japonism as witnessed in the 1890s vogue for william anderson's japanese prints donated to the british museum performances of noh plays in london and the success of gilbert and sullivan's operetta the mikado 1885 direct literary models were available from a number of sources including f. v. dickins's 1866 hyak nin is'shiu or stanzas by a century of poets being japanese lyrical odes the first english-language version of the hyakunin isshu a 13th-century anthology of 100 waka the early 20th-century critical writings and poems of sadakichi hartmann and contemporary french-language translations
the american poet ezra pound was introduced to the group in april 1909 and found that their ideas were close to his own in particular pound's studies of romantic literature had led him to an admiration of the condensed direct expression that he detected in the writings of arnaut daniel dante and guido cavalcanti amongst others for example in his 1911–12 series of essays i gather the limbs of osiris pound writes of daniel's line pensar de lieis m 'es repaus it rests me to think of her from the canzone en breu brizara 'l temps braus you cannot get statement simpler than that or clearer or less rhetorical these criteria of directness clarity and lack of rhetoric were to be amongst the defining qualities of imagist poetry through his friendship with laurence binyon pound had already developed an interest in japanese art by examining nishiki-e prints at the british museum and he quickly became absorbed in the study of related japanese verse forms
in an article in la france 1915 the french critic remy de gourmont described the imagists as descendants of the french symbolistes and in a 1928 letter to the french critic and translator rené taupin pound was keen to emphasise another ancestry for imagism pointing out that hulme was indebted to a symbolist tradition linking back via william butler yeats arthur symons and the rhymers'club generation of british poets to mallarmé. and the symbolist source was amplified further in taupin's study published in 1929 in which he concluded however great the divergence of technique and language'between the image of the imagist and the'symbol'of the symbolists there is a difference only of precision'. in 1915 pound edited the poetry of another 1890s poet lionel johnson for the publisher elkin mathews in his introduction he wrote
in 1911 pound introduced two other poets to the eiffel tower group his former fiancée hilda doolittle who had started signing her work h.d. and her future husband richard aldington these two were interested in exploring greek poetic models especially sappho an interest that pound shared the compression of expression that they achieved by following the greek example complemented the proto-imagist interest in japanese poetry and in 1912 during a meeting with them in the british museum tea room pound told h.d. and aldington that they were imagistes and even appended the signature h.d. imagiste to some poems they were discussing
when harriet monroe started her poetry magazine in 1911 she had asked pound to act as foreign editor in october 1912 he submitted thereto three poems each by h.d. and aldington under the imagiste rubric published in the november 1912 second issue thereof with a note which described aldington as'one of the'imagistes'. this note along with the appendix note ('the complete works of t. s. hulme') in pound's book also published in autumn 1912 entitled ripostes are considered to be first appearances of the word imagiste later anglicised to'imagists') in print
aldington's poems choricos to a greek marble and au vieux jardin were in the november issue of poetry and h.d.'s hermes of the ways priapus and epigram appeared in the january 1913 issue imagism as a movement was launched poetry's april issue published what came to be seen as imagism's enabling text the haiku-like poem of ezra pound entitled in a station of the metro
the apparition of these faces in the crowd
petals on a wet black bough
the march 1913 issue of poetry contained a few don 'ts by an imagiste and the essay entitled imagisme both written by pound with the latter being attributed to flint the latter contained this succinct statement of the group's position
direct treatment of the thing whether subjective or objective
to use absolutely no word that does not contribute to the presentation
as regarding rhythm to compose in sequence of the musical phrase not in sequence of the metronome
pound's note opened with a definition of an image as that which presents an intellectual and emotional complex in an instant of time pound goes on to state it is better to present one image in a lifetime than to produce voluminous works his list of don 'ts reinforced his three statements in imagism while warning that they should not be considered as dogma but as the result of long contemplation taken together these two texts comprised the imagist programme for a return to what they saw as the best poetic practice of the past f.s. flint commented we have never claimed to have invented the moon we do not pretend that our ideas are original
the 1916 preface to some imagist poets comments imagism does not merely mean the presentation of pictures imagism refers to the manner of presentation not to the subject
determined to promote the work of the imagists and particularly of aldington and h.d. pound decided to publish an anthology under the title des imagistes it was first published in alfred kreymborg's little magazine the glebe and was later published in 1914 by alfred and charles boni in new york and by harold monro at the poetry bookshop in london it became one of the most important and influential english-language collections of modernist verse included in the thirty-seven poems were ten poems by aldington seven by h.d. and six by pound the book also included work by f.s. flint skipwith cannell amy lowell william carlos williams james joyce ford madox ford allen upward and john cournos.max michelson was also another included in the important 1963 anthology by william pratt the imagist poem modern poetry in miniature
pound's editorial choices were based on what he saw as the degree of sympathy that these writers displayed with imagist precepts rather than active participation in a group as such williams who was based in the united states had not participated in any of the discussions of the eiffel tower group however he and pound had long been corresponding on the question of the renewal of poetry along similar lines ford was included at least partly because of his strong influence on pound as the younger poet made the transition from his earlier pre-raphaelite-influenced style towards a harder more modern way of writing the inclusion of a poem by joyce i hear an army which was sent to pound by w.b. yeats took on a wider importance in the history of literary modernism as the subsequent correspondence between the two led to the serial publication at pound's behest of a portrait of the artist as a young man in the egoist joyce's poem is not written in free verse but in rhyming quatrains however it strongly reflects pound's interest in poems written to be sung to music such as those by the troubadours and guido cavalcanti the book met with little popular or critical success at least partly because it had no introduction or commentary to explain what the poets were attempting to do and a number of copies were returned to the publisher
the following year pound and flint fell out over their different interpretations of the history and goals of the group arising from an article on the history of imagism written by flint and published in the egoist in may 1915 flint was at pains to emphasise the contribution of the eiffel tower poets especially edward storer pound who believed that the hellenic hardness that he saw as the distinguishing quality of the poems of h.d. and aldington was likely to be diluted by the custard of storer was to play no further direct role in the history of the imagists he went on to co-found the vorticists with his friend the painter and writer wyndham lewis
around this time the american imagist amy lowell moved to london determined to promote her own work and that of the other imagist poets lowell was a wealthy heiress from boston whose brother abbott lawrence lowell was president of harvard university from 1909-1933 she loved keats and cigars she was also an enthusiastic champion of literary experiment who was willing to use her money to publish the group lowell was determined to change the method of selection from pound's autocratic editorial attitude to a more democratic manner this new editorial policy was stated in the preface to the first anthology to appear under her leadership in this new book we have followed a slightly different arrangement to that of our former anthology instead of an arbitrary selection by an editor each poet has been permitted to represent himself by the work he considers his best the only stipulation being that it should not yet have appeared in book form the outcome was a series of imagist anthologies under the title some imagist poets the first of these appeared in 1915 planned and assembled mainly by h.d. and aldington two further issues both edited by lowell were published in 1916 and 1917 these three volumes featured most of the original poets also including imagist poetry by the american poet john gould fletcher with the exception of pound who had tried to persuade her to drop the imagist name from her publications and who sardonically dubbed this phase of imagism amy-gism
lowell persuaded d. h. lawrence to contribute poems to the 1915 and 1916 volumes making him the only writer to publish as both a georgian poet and an imagist marianne moore also became associated with the group during this period however with world war i as a backdrop the times were not easy for avant-garde literary movements aldington for example spent much of the war at the front and the 1917 anthology effectively marked the end of the imagists as a movement
in 1929 walter lowenfels jokingly suggested that aldington should produce a new imagist anthology aldington by now a successful novelist took up the suggestion and enlisted the help of ford and h.d. the result was the imagist anthology 1930 edited by aldington and including all the contributors to the four earlier anthologies with the exception of lowell who had died cannell who had disappeared and pound who declined the appearance of this anthology initiated a critical discussion of the place of the imagists in the history of 20th-century poetry
of the poets who were published in the various imagist anthologies joyce lawrence and aldington are now primarily remembered and read as novelists marianne moore who was at most a fringe member of the group carved out a unique poetic style of her own that retained an imagist concern with compression of language william carlos williams developed his poetic along distinctly american lines with his variable foot and a diction he claimed was taken from the mouths of polish mothers both pound and h.d. turned to writing long poems but retained much of the hard edge to their language as an imagist legacy most of the other members of the group are largely forgotten outside the context of the history of imagism
despite the movement's short life imagism would deeply influence the course of modernist poetry in english richard aldington in his 1941 memoir writes i think the poems of ezra pound d.h. lawrence and ford madox ford will continue to be read and to a considerable extent t. s. eliot and his followers have carried on their operations from positions won by the imagists
on the other hand wallace stevens found shortcomings in the imagist approach not all objects are equal the vice of imagism was that it did not recognize this with its demand for hardness clarity and precision and its insistence on fidelity to appearances coupled with its rejection of irrelevant subjective emotions imagism had later effects that are demonstratable in t. s. eliot's'preludes'and'morning at the window'and in d. h. lawrence's animal and flower pieces the rejection of conventional verse forms in the nineteen-twenties owed much to the imagists repudiation of the georgian poetry style
the influence of imagism can be seen clearly in the work of the objectivist poets who came to prominence in the 1930s under the auspices of pound and williams the objectivists worked mainly in free verse clearly linking objectivism's principles with imagism's louis zukofsky insisted in his introduction to the 1931 objectivist issue of poetry on writing which is the detail not mirage of seeing of thinking with the things as they exist and of directing them along a line of melody zukofsky was a major influence on the language poets who carried the imagist focus on formal concerns to a high level of development basil bunting another objectivist poet was a key figure in the early development of the british poetry revival a loose movement that also absorbed the influence of the san francisco renaissance poets
imagism influenced a number of poetry circles and movements.with the imagists free verse became a discipline and acquired status as a legitimate poetic form in the 1950s especially with the beat generation the black mountain poets and others associated with the san francisco renaissance in his seminal 1950 essay projective verse charles olson the theorist of the black mountain group wrote one perception must immediately and directly lead to a further perception his credo derived from and supplemented the imagists
among the beats gary snyder and allen ginsberg in particular were influenced by the imagist emphasis on chinese and japanese poetry william carlos williams was another who had a strong effect on the beat poets encouraging poets like lew welch and writing an introduction for the book publication of ginsberg's howl 1955
operation eastern exit was the codename given to the military evacuation of the united states embassy in mogadishu the capital of somalia in january 1991 in late december 1990 violence quickly enveloped the city as armed militants began clashing with government soldiers on 1 january 1991 the us ambassador to somalia james keough bishop contacted the department of state requesting an evacuation of the embassy which was approved the following day united states central command began planning and mobilizing forces that evening the initial plan was to evacuate with a military transport plane through the mogadishu international airport but this was later abandoned a helicopter evacuation via the uss guam and uss trenton was the remaining option
on the morning of 5 january a 60-person marine and navy seal security detail was dispatched from guam aboard two ch-53e super stallion helicopters to secure the embassy and prepare for the main evacuation the two helicopters returned to guam with the first 61 evacuees throughout the day foreign diplomats and civilians sought refuge at the embassy four waves of five ch-46 sea knight helicopters each evacuated the embassy compound shortly after midnight on 6 january the evacuees were transported to muscat oman where they disembarked on 11 january in total 281 diplomats and civilians from 30 countries were evacuated including 12 heads of missions eight ambassadors and four chargés d 'affaires
in the late 1980s there was increasing rebellion against the rule of somali president siad barre a military dictator who maintained tight control of power and had a record of human rights abuses by 1990 what began as civil disobedience evolved into a civil war with several militias organized to overthrow the central government
in july 1989 the embassy moved to a new 80-acre 32 ha compound 6 miles 9.7 km from the previous embassy and james k. bishop was appointed as the united states'ambassador to somalia ambassador bishop had significant experience in crisis management at us embassies in 1967 he was at the us embassy in beirut lebanon when the six-day war erupted about 3,600 americans were evacuated in 33 hours bishop was one of 26 diplomats and soldiers that remained in the city as deputy assistant secretary of state for africa from 1981–87 bishop chaired several task forces for crises and gained experience in the state department's operations center as evacuations were carried out during several coups d 'etat during his previous assignment as ambassador to liberia 1987–90 bishop was overseeing the voluntary evacuation of embassy staff and civilians as a civil war in liberia spread when he left in march 1990 soon after returning to washington to prepare for his new appointment to somalia he was appointed to a taskforce to deal with the crisis in liberia which included a gradual evacuation of american civilians and a rapid closure of the embassy in august
on 1 august before leaving the us to take up his post in mogadishu ambassador bishop visited united states central command — the military command for the middle east and northeast africa — where he spent most of the day with its commander gen. norman schwarzkopf ambassador bishop aware of the ongoing strife believed the odds were better than even that we would have to leave mogadishu under less than favorable circumstances ambassador bishop understood from his past experiences in beirut and liberia the importance of being prepared to deal with emergencies and spent the afternoon working with military experts to review the embassy's emergencies and evacuation e e plan until he was satisfied ... that central command realized that it might have to conduct an evacuation from mogadishu and was prepared to do that in its analysis of operation eastern exit the center for naval analyses cited the ambassador bishop's previous experience and clear understanding of his role in the operation as one of the reasons operation eastern exit went so well
hours after ambassador bishop's visit to central command iraq invaded kuwait in 1979 the us negotiated access to an airport and port in both mogadishu and berbera because of limited access the us had to locations in the persian gulf area maintaining this access was a main interest for the mogadishu embassy to pursue as the us mobilized to intervene in kuwait
an increasing level of criminal violence prompted ambassador bishop to request the voluntary evacuation of dependents e.g. children and spouses of staff and non-essential staff in early december although fighting between the government and the united somali congress a rebel militia remained no less than about 100 miles 160 km away the voluntary evacuation later became a mandatory evacuation by 19 december the number of official us personnel in the city was reduced from 147 to 37 around the same time fighting between the government and rebels came within about 40 miles 64 km of mogadishu
on 30 december violence escalated an order of magnitude as militants entered mogadishu which was quickly enveloped by a general state of lawlessness on 30–31 december diplomats including many stationed in offices elsewhere in the city were collected and housed in the embassy compound except two volunteers who remained in the embassy's k-7 residential apartments located across afgoy road from the embassy the volunteers in the k-7 building would be needed as look-outs for the embassy compound's main gate on the morning of 31 december the defense attaché was nearly killed when his vehicle was sprayed with bullets and that evening a soldier at a roadblock shot the tires of a vehicle carrying another defense official attempts by the us and other nations'diplomats in particular the italian embassy to negotiate a ceasefire for foreigners to leave were unsuccessful afgoy road became a shooting gallery preventing those in safe-havens outside the embassy from reaching it on new year's day the first american civilians began to seek refuge at the embassy
ambassador bishop requested an evacuation of the american community on 1 january indicating that the evacuation could be with the planned italian french or german evacuation efforts but preferred an evacuation by the us military the state department authorized the evacuation on 2 january and on that day ambassador bishop specifically requested an evacuation by the us military thereby initiating operation eastern exit ambassador bishop had spent a considerable amount of time discussing contingency plans for evacuation with other diplomatic posts ultimately ten heads of missions — eight ambassadors and two chargés d 'affaires — along with their staff sought refuge in the us embassy compound and were evacuated
ambassador bishop had visited central command in august 1990 where he worked with military experts to update the embassy's e e plan the first notice that an evacuation of the mogadishu embassy would be needed came on the morning of 1 january when the top naval commander at central command sent a message to his naval operations staff better have amphib crowd take a look at a helo neo of mogadishu time distance to get there from masirah op area following the ambassador's 2 january evacuation request the commander of central command ordered air force aircraft to the region the movement of amphibious ships to mogadishu and requested united states special operations command to prepare for a noncombatant evacuation operation
the initial plan was to evacuate via mogadishu international airport soon after the evacuation request the united states air force deployed c-130 transport planes and an ac-130 for gunfire support to nairobi kenya awaiting clearances to enter somalia and the ability to safely transfer evacuees from the embassy to the airport however the us and other foreign embassies were unable to contact anyone within the government to obtain clearances it also became apparent that the rebels had an ineffective command-and-control structure making it impossible to negotiate any ceasefire or guarantee of safe passage likewise government troops faced a command-and-control problem reports indicated that army units were separating along clan lines in some cases soldiers shot officers of a different clan when given orders they disagreed with thus it became clear that safe passage to the airport would not be possible several other nations also had aircraft mobilized to reach mogadishu but faced the same problems of landing and transit of evacuees to the airport
on 4 january several incidents including a couple exchanges of gunfire suggested that the embassy's security detail was insufficient to hold off armed somalis until the uss guam and uss trenton arrived with their helicopters and soldiers at that time scheduled to arrive on 7 january the embassy had just six marine guards whose job was limited to protecting the chancery ambassador bishop made an urgent request to washington for two platoons of soldiers to parachute into the embassy to defend it until the ships arrived the request was denied but the ambassador was told that an advance element from the vessels would reach the embassy the following morning
uss guam and uss trenton began transit from the coast of oman towards mogadishu at 22 30 23 30 oman time on 2 january the commander of amphibious group two had initially proposed a seven-ship amphibious task group composed of vessels anchored at masirah island off oman and dubai and including four amphibious ships so that the full range of amphibious capabilities would be available for the operation however intervention in kuwait seemed imminent and the commander of naval forces at central command did not want to divert that many ships from the persian gulf thus the decision to send two of the closest ships although the two vessels were selected by mid-afternoon on 2 january the transfer of some personnel from dubai to masirah caused a delay of eight to ten hours guam and trenton carried forces from the 4th marine expeditionary brigade including a detachment of ch-53e super stallion helicopters — the largest helicopters operated by the us military — and two squadrons of ch-46 sea knight helicopters
planning began in earnest as the ships got underway with a combined command center on guam on the morning of 3 january the task force's command questioned why they were not given the option of an amphibious landing and requested a tank landing ship be added to the task force the request was denied a warrant officer who had previously served as a marine security guard at the mogadishu embassy during the mid-1980s was found despite ambassador bishop's planning with central command the task force was provided outdated information the former msg told planners that a new embassy had been planned and was under construction several years prior in fact the new embassy was located further inland and after receiving updated information task force commanders determined that a beach landing requiring troops to fight their way across the city was too risky initial plans had the ships launch their helicopters at 01 00 on 7 january however in response to indications from ambassador bishop that conditions in mogadishu were deteriorating planners considered 1,050-nautical-mile 1,940 km 1,210 mi and later 890-nautical-mile 1,650 km 1,020 mi flights with the ch-53es while the ships were still located in the northern arabian sea the situation in mogadishu stabilized somewhat and the mission was delayed until 5 january
on the evening of 4 january the final execute order was issued for a 02 45 launch of two ch-53e super stallions to arrive at the embassy at dawn the 60 soldiers selected for the security detail were issued weapons and ammunition two marine corps kc-130 refueling tankers were mobilized closer to the operation from bahrain to oman to refuel the helicopters en route to mogadishu and the two helicopters transferred from trenton to guam
two ch-53e super stallions carrying a 60-man security detail — 51 marines and nine navy seals — departed guam at 02 47 466 nautical miles 863 km 536 mi from the embassy and were expected to arrive at 06 20 they performed two aerial refuelings during the first refueling a pipe burst on one of the helicopters dousing soldiers in fuel and nearly forcing a return to the guam problems with the helicopters'navigation system also complicated the refueling rendezvous the helicopters arrived in mogadishu at dawn crossing the coast just south of the harbor at 25–50 feet 7.6–15.2 m in altitude on a route that was planned to avoid areas of more intense violence reported in the northern parts of the city on their arrival in mogadishu the crew of the helicopters were using an outdated 1969 map which showed the embassy in an isolated area furthermore they had been told the embassy could be discerned by its white stucco perimeter wall and golf course the embassy was in fact surrounded by new development and the crew saw white stucco walls around many buildings in the city the helicopters were flying too low to spot a strobe light which was placed on the embassy's water tower the highest point within the embassy compound and the golf course in the embassy compound had a black oil-coated surface — not the familiar green grass that the helicopter crew would recognize.after breaking radio silence their only direct communication with the embassy was unencrypted to contact the embassy they were able to discern it and land at 07 10 as they arrived a group of about 100 to 150 somalis were attempting to enter the embassy compound via ladders on the wall but scattered as the helicopters arrived
the security detail moved to establish a perimeter around the embassy compound and the air force's ac-130 arrived to provide overhead support ambassador bishop gave the security detail clear instructions on the rules of engagement they could only use deadly force if people came over the embassy compound's walls with obvious hostile intent he also identified three zones of defense stating a preference to retreat to the third zone before the use of deadly force
the entire embassy compound
the chancery joint administrative office jao building marine house and the helicopter landing zone hlz
the chancery and jao buildings the two safehaven buildings where the evacuees were held
ambassador bishop clearly explained his rationale to the security detail which was to avoid any impression that they were intervening in the violence in mogadishu he feared that the embassy would be targeted by organized attacks if any group involved in the clashes got the impression that the us was intervening in the conflict to this effect he requested the voice of america and bbc broadcast announcements that the forces were present only to evacuate the embassy and would not interfere in the conflict the marines who had been doused in fuel during the refueling were able to take a shower and wash their clothes
after an hour on the ground the helicopters left with the first 61 evacuees including all american civilians and four heads of mission evacuees were provided blankets on one of the flights to remain warm complications with the only in-flight refueling on the return nearly prevented refueling which would have forced the helicopters to divert to the somali desert and await a rescue at 9 40 the helicopters arrived on guam and unloaded the evacuees
no threats came upon the embassy during the day although truckloads of armed somalis frequently drove by the embassy along afghoy road only one incident seemed to directly target the embassy a sniper and a spotter were positioned on the embassy's water tower the highest structure in the compound and came under fire they were ordered to not return fire and soon thereafter ordered to leave their position on the water tower
the office of military cooperation just one and a half blocks from the embassy required evacuation despite its proximity to the embassy an armed convoy was needed to evacuate persons trapped there by the unrest a convoy of vehicles with several marines and seals left the embassy at 8 47 and returned ten minutes later with 22 persons from the omc four americans a filipino and 17 kenyans this was the only excursion outside the embassy by the security detail throughout the day foreign diplomats contacted the embassy desiring to be evacuated the us welcomed these requests but required all of them to find their own transportation to the embassy
a somali officer who had a previous relationship with the embassy major siad agreed to travel to rescue the german chargé d 'affaires and british ambassador junior staff from the british embassy had previously come to the us embassy the soviet union was unable to land a plane in mogadishu the previous day and the soviet ambassador asked ambassador bishop if he and his staff could be rescued ambassador bishop a tennis partner of his soviet counterpart agreed but only if they found their own way to the embassy seeing the helicopters on the morning of 5 january they realized the americans would not remain in the city much longer at the request of ambassador bishop major siad agreed to transport the soviets but only if he was paid enough the us embassy paid major siad who returned with the soviet ambassador and 38 of his staff the brother of president barre who was also a major general and chief of police showed up at the embassy in the afternoon with 25 members of his family requesting to be evacuated but was turned away after a vocal conversation with the ambassador
the operation did not include soldiers to handle the evacuation control center ecc which was set up in the jao a 44-person force consisting primarily of soldiers to handle the ecc was planned for insertion with the ch-53e super stallions after they had returned to the guam however this was cancelled over objections from the commander of the security detail the deficit was partially handled by embassy staff who assisted a few soldiers from the security detail the evacuees were grouped into 15-person sticks to be loaded onto the helicopters and were limited to one piece of luggage apiece some attempted to bring more resulting in problems coordinating their evacuation furthermore many evacuees had pets they wanted to bring which were not allowed most pets were killed by their owners some were given poison meanwhile the soldiers were allowed to consume anything they wanted from the embassy's commissary such as candy sodas and souvenirs most had been stationed on ships for several months they were also allowed use or take anything they needed from the embassy the medic filled several bags with medical supplies to return to the ship
as evening approached work began to prepare the hlz for the main evacuation the area was used as a parking lot and several vehicles were left without keys by staff that had already been evacuated some cars had to be broken into to be moved chemical lights were placed in the hlz in a nato y pattern the entire mission would be conducted with night vision goggles which required all lights in the embassy compound to be turned off
the main evacuation occurred in the early morning hours of 6 january and consisted of four waves of five ch-46 helicopters the timing of this phase was determined by range of the ch-46 sea knight which lack aerial refueling capability the ships were about 350–380 nautical miles 650–700 km 400–440 mi away during this phase an ac-130 was sent from saudi arabia to provide gunfire support during the evacuation and two uh-1 iroquois helicopters were on standby to provide gunfire support but were not deployed
the first wave departed guam at 23 43 as the second wave landed major siad arrived at the embassy gate accompanied by two truckloads of soldiers and held a grenade in one hand and a radio in the other his request to speak with the ambassador was granted major siad demanded that the evacuation cease immediately because the somali government had not granted the us permission to carry out such a military operation he claimed that he would radio soldiers to shoot down the helicopters if the operation continued the second and third waves were able to depart without incident as the ambassador negotiated with the major who finally agreed to settle the matter for several thousand dollars in cash and keys to the ambassador's armored car ambassador bishop remained engaged in conversation with the major until he reached the helicopter landing zone to depart with the final wave to prevent the major from reneging on the deal the final wave departed the embassy at 1 49 and landed on guam at 2 23 twenty minutes later ambassador bishop declared the evacuation complete
armed looters were observed entering the embassy compound as the final wave departed the doors of the chancery — the main building of the embassy — were reportedly blown open by rpgs within two hours of the embassy's evacuation somali employees of the embassy — known as foreign service nationals fsns — could not be evacuated ambassador bishop tried unsuccessfully to have these employees airlifted to safer parts of somalia many of the fsns had sought refuge in the embassy with their families and about 30 were hired as guards and protected the embassy throughout the ordeal local banks had been closed for some time and the embassy was unable to pay the fsns the ambassador left the fsns with keys to the commissary and warehouse on the embassy compound and they were permitted to take anything they needed
a total of 281 evacuees were taken from the embassy including 12 heads of missions eight ambassadors and four chargés d 'affaires and 61 americans including ambassador bishop and 36 embassy staff the heads of mission were the ambassadors of the united states kenya nigeria soviet union sudan turkey united arab emirates and united kingdom and the chargés of the embassies of germany kuwait oman and qatar
rather than disembark in nearby mombasa as originally thought by the evacuees the ships were ordered back to oman — a five-day journey the sailors and marines made way for the evacuees to share living quarters when the chaplain of guam asked crew to sign up as guides for the evacuees while aboard the vessel two hundred signed up within an hour and some of the sailors even dressed up as clowns to ease the ordeal for children at the request of the ambassadors a formal session with the ships'senior officers was held to express their thanks on 11 january the evacuees were offloaded at muscat oman that afternoon the american evacuees were flown to frankfurt germany from where they continued home
the 2010 claxton shield was the 57th claxton shield tournament the premier baseball competition in australia and was held from 6 november 2009 to 7 february 2010 it was hailed as the precursor to the new australian baseball league that will start in the place of the claxton shield in late 2010 to early 2011 the victoria aces defeated south australia two games to nil in the championship series to win the tournament this was the 22nd time the claxton shield had been awarded to a victorian team the competition was sponsored by domino's pizza
at the conclusion of the regular season the victoria aces finished in first place with a 17–7 record earning home-field advantage for the three-game championship series south australia hosted the three-game semi-final series against the new south wales patriots both teams finished with a 14–10 record the perth heat 12–12 and queensland rams 3–21 both failed to qualify for the finals
in june 2009 it was announced that the rights to the claxton shield had been sold to a new australian baseball league abl with ownership split between major league baseball's 75 percent share and the 25 percent share owned by the australian baseball federation the 2010 tournament was considered preparation for the inaugural abl season starting in 2010–11 it varied from the 2009 claxton shield by expanding the season to include ten rounds since an uneven number five teams were involved four teams paired off for each round and played a three-game series while the remaining team took a bye during the season each team had two bye rounds and played two rounds against each other team one at home and one away in total the schedule allowed for 24 regular-season games per team before a postseason similar to the 2009 edition the first-place team directly qualified for the championship series and played against the winner of a playoff series between the second- and third-place teams
during the regular season games were played on a friday night and a doubleheader on saturday in each doubleheader one of the two games was shortened to seven innings the exception to this was when perth played their home games they played on a thursday night instead of a doubleheader on saturday each postseason series was scheduled for a friday saturday and sunday
the 2010 series allowed each team to make use of a 19-man active roster exceptions were made in two cases that allowed teams'active rosters to expand to 21 players both times for the same reason two games during the season had to be postponed because of poor weather both games involved teams meeting for the first time during the season make-up games were scheduled at the start of the return series between the teams and this resulted in two four-game series in both cases the teams had a 19-man roster for the make-up game and an expanded 21-man roster for the originally scheduled series
the 2010 claxton shield was contested between five teams from around australia in previous years many of the teams had played their home games at multiple venues this season each team held their home games at only one venue there was one scheduled exception to this at the start of the season the new south wales patriots'final home series against the perth heat was held at gilchrist oval whereas all of their other home games were held at blacktown baseball stadium
as a result of poor attendance at geelong baseball park game one of the fifth-round series between new south wales and the victoria aces was moved to la trobe university melbourne although the geelong games had attracted crowds of no more than 500 the moved game had an attendance of 2,200 though no further regular season games were moved the finals series hosted by the aces was held at la trobe university as well
the venues are as follows
† — a game postponed from round 7 held in round 8 was played with victoria aces as the away team and queensland rams as the home team despite being played at geelong baseball park geelong victoria
‡ — a game postponed from round 3 held in round 9 was played with south australia as the away team and victoria aces as the home team despite being played at norwood oval adelaide south australia
the queensland rams were the first team to be eliminated from contention for the finals after being swept four games to nil by the victoria aces in round 8 the following round saw south australia clinch a position in the finals despite finishing the round in second position it was not until the final round that the last two spots in the finals were decided the aces clinched top spot by sweeping the perth heat which combined with the new south wales patriots sweep of the rams eliminated perth from contention and secured the last finals spot for the patriots
the 2010 claxton shield made use of the same finals structure as had been used in the 2009 season the top three teams at the conclusion of the ten rounds of regular-season games qualified the second- and third-place teams faced in each other in a best-of-three series hosted by the second-place team the winner of that series then faced the first-place team for a best-of-three series south australia hosted the new south wales patriots at norwood oval adelaide while the victoria aces hosted the championship series at la trobe university melbourne in the finals the home team and away team alternated during each of the series as a result south australia was officially the away team for game two of its series against new south wales as was victoria in the championship series
after defeating the patriots two games to one in the semi-final series south australia progressed to the championship series against the aces there they were defeated two games to nil after game two of the championship series victoria's matthew blackmore was named both claxton shield final series mvp and pitcher of the year
at the conclusion of the finals series the winner of two awards were announced matthew blackmore won both the pitcher of the year award and the finals series mvp award at the baseball australia diamond awards held on 6 march at the hotel grand chancellor adelaide wayne lundgren was announced as the 35th winner of the helms award the claxton shield's most valuable player award lundgren was the first pitcher to win since 1986 runners-up by two votes were paul mildren and michael collins
independiente is the thirteenth spanish-language studio album by guatemalan singer-songwriter ricardo arjona released on 23 september 2011 recorded in the united states and mexico it was produced by arjona with dan warner lee levin and puerto rican singer-songwriter tommy torres the album — the first independent release by arjona after he was signed by sony music in 1993 and warner music in 2008 — was issued by his own label metamorfosis
composed and written in a year the record marks arjona and torres'fourth collaboration for independiente arjona returns to his trademark sound after his stylistic departure for poquita ropa 2010 while producing the latter he had used fewer instruments to simplify his sound having introduced what had been called a stripped-down acoustic effort in his music independiente has been compared to his earlier recordings historias 1994 and animal nocturno 1993
independiente became arjona's fourth number-one album on the billboard top latin albums where it debuted for the week ending 22 october 2011 for thirteen non-consecutive weeks it topped the latin pop albums chart and reached number one on the mexican albums chart it is his fifth consecutive album to chart on the billboard 200 reaching number sixty-five and his fourth album to chart in spain peaking at number sixty-eight within one week after its release independiente was certified gold in chile the united states and mexico and certified platinum in venezuela and argentina
five singles have been released from the album the lead single el amor became a commercial success in several latin american countries and was number one on the billboard latin songs and latin pop songs charts it was followed by fuiste tú featuring gaby moreno which reached number one on the latin pop songs number two on the latin songs charts and topped several other national charts mi novia se me está poniendo vieja was released in may 2012 te quiero in july 2012 and si tu no existieras in november 2012 to promote independiente arjona embarked on his metamorfosis world tour
in 2010 arjona wanted to change his musical style after experimenting with using as few instruments as possible he obtained a sound similar to an a capella performance simplifying his sound and introduced what he called a stripped-down acoustic effort to his music this was heard on his twelfth studio album poquita ropa arjona produced the album with dan warner who has worked with shakira celine dion and christina aguilera when promoting the album arjona said songs are like women they get things up and are so concerned about this that they forget that the less clothes more beauty the songs are often overwhelmed by ourselves because we saturate them with arrangements looking to exalt their qualities and we end up hiding them poquita ropa became the first album since adentro which arjona recorded without torres
weeks before the release of independiente arjona issued a letter raising the issue of his past relationships with recording companies he revealed the circumstances of his first contract a producer friend of mine told them the record label that if they did not sign me in they won 't sign two artists he had at that time arjona further explained that he received the minimum royalty percentage from his most successful albums independiente is arjona's first independent release through his own label metamorfosis a company he created to refocus his career the company is presided by arjona and several friends including photographer-director ricardo calderón universal music méxico executive humberto calderon and bmg's miriam sommerz and is based in miami and mexico city arjona commented that his independence represented compromise more than freedom stating that inside the word'independent', even when it sounds like extreme freedom there's a big amount of compromise and the responsibility of being able to administrate in the best way possible such independence billboard notes that although other groups have released independent albums following contracts with major labels arjona is the most important latin pop artist to do so although the album is marketed within the new label distribution was handled by warner music
independiente marked arjona's fourth collaboration with torres the latter was a composer and producer also receiving background-vocal credit the musicians first worked together in 2005 when arjona released his tenth studio album adentro he stated that he first tested torres by sending him the hookiest and darkest tracks on the album acompañame a estar solo and iluso torres then went all out on the first demo hiring a full band that included a string orchestra in quién dijo ayer 2007 torres produced the singles quién and quiero and provided background vocals on the remastered versions of arjona's past hits in 5to piso 2008 torres produced several tracks one was the lead single como duele considered arjona's biggest hit in years by jason birchmeier of allmusic
the album was composed over a one-year period most of its production was handled by three producers familiar with arjona's work dan warner lee levin and dan rudin tommy torres also produced three tracks the lead single el amor second single fuiste tú and hay amores victor patrón produced two songs caudillo and the piano version of mi novia se me está poniendo vieja and julio chávez aided in the production of reconciliación arjona wrote all the songs except el amor which was co-written with torres the album was recorded and produced in several cities in the united states and mexico independiente was mixed at the blue grotto in nashville tennessee and mastered by tom coyne and aya merrill at sterling sound in new york city with torres'return to producing arjona regained the classic trademark sound which torres helped develop since 2005
independiente opens with lo que está bien está mal a latin pop song and the only track composed by dan warner instead of arjona who wrote the lyrics el amor was motivated by arjona's desire to examine those big dark events within love that nobody talks about he continued the dark sides of love are extremely fundamental to understand its great value arjona added so many good things abould love has been shown that somebody had to turn it around and tell the bad ones in a february 2012 interview arjona stated that el amor was the most tawdry song he had released to date explaining that their choice of the song was a contradiction because it was not the song which could better represent the entire album he described it as very strong and a bit dark the single marked arjona's return to his signature mainstream sound after the cuban music influenced poquita ropa's lead single puente a mixture of salsa and merengue which failed to make an impact in the united states
the album includes fuiste tú a duet with guatemalan singer gaby moreno its instrumentation consists of piano violin guitars drums and other percussion although arjona stated that he had the possibilities to record this song with very well known people he expressed his happiness with moreno revealing that the possibilities of doing it with her for me are a celebration he described moreno as incredibly talented a countrywoman and a fantastic human being arjona named fuiste tú as one of the most important songs on the album mi novia se me está poniendo vieja took two years to complete and arjona dedicated it to his mother noemí morales he stated that he wrote it as a gift for my mom on mother's day and that he thought the idea of including it on the album was very good as with his single señora de las cuatro decadas on 1994's historias at first he never thought to include the song on an album caudillo evokes the image of some friends arjona had at college he asserted that he appears constantly there because sometimes we transform ourselves into a contradiction of all those things we fought in those moments it's the history of a student leader that becomes a president arjona dedicated the album to his father who died in 2011
independiente was first digitally released in some south american countries on 23 september 2011 as a special edition dubbed the cono sur edition this version included a different mix of reconciliación on 30 september the digital download for the standard edition of the album was released in several latin american and european countries on 4 october the album was officially released as a digital download and compact disc in most of these same markets as well as north america an itunes edition was released as a digital download on the itunes music store this version included an album-only video entitled independiente in germany the album was first available on the kiwi label on 4 october and on 11 october through warner music in canada and spain the compact-disc version of the album was available on 25 october

a contributor to the colombian website cmi commented that listening to independiente is a labyrinth to go through each song is a huge path that seems to have no end because it involves imagination it invites you to dream to charm to bewitch but neither leaves behind the problematic requirements of love its loopholes hideouts and concerns as well as its bad times in this joke that's life independiente was nominated at the premios juventud of 2012 for the lo toco todo i play it all award on 25 september 2012 the album received two nominations at the 13th annual latin grammy awards album of the year and best singer-songwriter album on 3 december 2012 independiente received a nomination for pop album of the year at the 2013 premios lo nuestro awards it also received a nomination for grammy award for best latin pop album at the grammy awards of 2013 arjona does not win the latter award since 2005 with adentro in a shared win with mexican singer julieta venegas in february 2013 independiente received a nomination for latin pop album of the year at the billboard latin music awards of 2013

the 2003 pacific typhoon season was a slightly below average yearlong period of tropical cyclogenesis exhibiting the development of 31 tropical depressions of which 21 became named storms of those 14 became typhoons though every month with the exception of february and march featured tropical activity most storms developed from may through october during the season tropical cyclones affected the philippines japan china the korean peninsula indochina and various islands in the western pacific
the season ran year-round with the first storm yanyan developing west of the marshall islands on january 15 in april typhoon kujira became one of the longest-lasting pacific typhoons in history and attained climatological records for its unusually early impacts typhoon imbudo in july caused several deaths and extensive damage across the philippines and china in september typhoon maemi became one of the costliest typhoons in recorded history after striking south korea maemi was also the most intense tropical cyclone of the season with a minimum barometric pressure of 910 mbar hpa 26.87 inhg in late november typhoon lupit devastated areas of yap state in the federated states of micronesia the season closed with the dissipation of a tropical depression east of the philippines on december 27
the scope of this article is limited to the pacific ocean north of the equator and west of the international date line storms that form east of the date line and north of the equator are called hurricanes see 2003 pacific hurricane season tropical storms formed in the entire west pacific basin are assigned a name by the tokyo typhoon center tropical depressions in this basin monitored by the joint typhoon warning center jtwc have the w suffix added to their number tropical depressions that enter or form in the philippine area of responsibility are assigned a name by the philippine atmospheric geophysical and astronomical services administration or pagasa this can often result in the same storm having two names
on march 5 2003 meteorologists from the university college london at the tropical storm risk tsr consortium issued an extended range forecast for the typhoon season noting the likelihood of near average tropical cyclone activity as a result of projected neutral sea surface temperatures the forecast indicated the potential for 26.2 tropical storms compared to the 10–and 30-year average of 27.8 and 26.3 storms respectively the following month the group raised their forecast for tropical storms to 26.7 indicating a slightly above average season over next two months however fluctuations in sea surface temperatures particularly those in the central pacific caused the group to revise their predictions downward and indicated the probability for a slightly below average typhoon season in their june forecast a rise in sea surface temperatures in the following months prompted the forecasting group to once again raise their forecasts to indicate a near-average season in their final august forecast update which predicted 27 tropical storms the group was very accurate in their forecasts with their april and august forecasts being the most accurate
similarly meteorologists working with the city university of hong kong issued a seasonal projection on april 24 2003 indicating the likelihood of a normal or below normal season with 29 total tropical cyclones 26 tropical storms and 16 typhoons as with the tsr the group primarily based their forecast numbers on the prevailing status of the el niño-southern oscillation the city university of hong kong revised their forecasts on june 24 2003 indicating a slight increase of total tropical cyclones to 30 the group was also accurate in their forecasts for the entirety of the northwest pacific though their specialized forecasts for the south china sea were substantially off
during the year the japan meteorological agency jma issued advisories on tropical cyclones west of the international date line to the malay peninsula and north of the equator this was due to the agency's status as the official regional specialized meteorological center as designated by the world meteorological organization in 1989 the jma issued forecasts and analyses four times a day beginning at 0000 utc and continuing every six hours the jma issued forecasts based on a climatological tropical cyclone forecast model the agency estimated 10 minute sustained winds and barometric pressure based on the dvorak technique and numerical weather prediction the jtwc also issued warnings on storms within the basin operating from pearl harbor in hawaii to represent the interests of the united states armed forces in the indian and pacific oceans
throughout the season sea surface temperatures within the western equatorial pacific were above normal including those in the south china sea areas of convection persisted year-round in the lower latitudes particularly around the philippines atmospheric divergence was also prevalent in the same regions resulting in enhanced tropical cyclogenesis east of the philippines in 2003 the mean region of development of tropical systems during the year was more southwest than the 1971–2000 30-year average in 2003 the jma monitored 21 tropical cyclones of at least tropical storm intensity of those 14 reached typhoon intensity though the number of tropical storms was below average the ratio between tropical storms and typhoons was 66 greater than normal the philippine atmospheric geophysical and astronomical services administration pagasa monitored three additional cyclones of at least tropical storm intensity that were not monitored by the jma
the season began with the formation of tropical storm yanyan on january 15 after its dissipation five days later no tropical cyclones of at least tropical storm intensity developed over the next two months this period of inactivity ended with the formation of typhoon kujira in mid-april kujira was one of the longest lived pacific storms on record and was the first typhoon with 1-minute sustained winds of at least 240 km h 150 mph in april since typhoon isa in 1997 tropical activity was enhanced from may to june and during this period the jma monitored four tropical storms while the pagasa monitored a fifth storm off the eastern philippines three of the four tropical storms monitored by the jma approached or hit japan including typhoon soudelor which brought heavy rainfall and wind across the ryukyu islands and the korean peninsula
tropical activity once again declined towards the second half of june and first half of july the second half of july however featured the development of typhoons imbudo and koni which both tracked westward across the philippines before striking areas near saipan and other regions of southeastern china imbudo caused the deaths of 78 people and us 383 million in damage august was a highly active month for tropical cyclogenesis with a total of six tropical storms monitored by the jma jtwc and pagasa this included typhoons krovanh and dujuan which also struck southeastern china typhoon etau earlier in the month made landfall in japan resulting in 17 deaths
activity was somewhat below average in september with only one tropical cyclone making landfall maemi however maemi was the strongest tropical cyclone of the season and was the costliest with roughly us 4.8 billion in damage mostly in south korea tropical cyclogenesis and activity continued to decline after august with october featuring only three tropical storms however two ketsana and parma reached typhoon intensity both stayed away from land november featured less storms but was climatologically average with two typhoons developing the second typhoon lupit devastated portions of yap state resulting in approximately 1.7 million in damage in december the jtwc and pagasa monitored a sole tropical system east of the philippines though the jma did not monitor or classify any tropical cyclones during the month
in storm information below wind-speed advisories differ from the joint typhoon warning center jtwc to the jma as the jtwc uses the united states criteria of 1-minute mean to designate maximum sustained winds while the jma uses the 10-minute mean wind criteria to designate tropical cyclone maximum sustained winds this difference generally results in jtwc maximum winds appearing higher than the maximum winds described by the jma for the same cyclone
on january 11 the jtwc began monitoring the disturbance that would eventually develop into yanyan near the international date line as the system tracked westward it gradually moved into a more favorable environment for tropical cyclogenesis on january 14 surface observations indicated that the low-pressure area had developed a closed low-level circulation center indicative of a tropical cyclone satellite imagery remained inconclusive nonetheless the jma classified the pressure area as a tropical depression west of the marshall islands at 0600 utc on january 15 the jtwc would follow suit by classifying the storm as such at 1800 utc later that day at the time the depression was tracking west-northwest under the influence of a subtropical ridge to the north over the next day the system waned in convective activity before resuming its previous track and accelerating at 0000 utc on january 17 the jtwc upgraded the system to tropical storm intensity though the storm remained nameless as the jma continued to classify it as a tropical depression
throughout january 17 the tropical storm would again oscillate in strength resulting in a brief downgrade by the jtwc to tropical depression intensity however an increase in deep convection resulted in its reclassification as a tropical storm at 1800 utc that day followed by the jma upgrading the system to tropical storm intensity at 1200 utc on january 18 as such the storm received the name yanyan at roughly the same time the tropical cyclone began to stall east of the mariana islands and curve sharply northeastward whilst the jtwc indicated that yanyan peaked in strength late on january 18 with 1-minute sustained winds of 60 km h 37 mph the jma considered the system to have maintained the same intensity throughout its stint as a tropical storm steered by the same nearby subtropical ridge yanyan would continue to track towards the northeast into a less favorable tropical cyclone environment the jma downgraded yanyan to tropical depression at 1200 utc on january 20 before the storm transitioned into an extratropical cyclone as its low-level circulation center decoupled from the primary mass of convection due to strong wind shear at 0000 utc both the jtwc and jma discontinued the monitoring of yanyan
kujira developed from a broad area of disturbed weather as a tropical depression on april 9 well removed from any landmasses shortly after development kujira quickly intensified in its early stages and was upgraded to a tropical storm just two days after cyclogenesis strengthening slowed afterwards though the storm attained typhoon intensity on april 14 intensification continued and late on april 15 kujira reached its peak intensity with winds of 165 km h 105 mph and a minimum barometric pressure of 930 mbar hpa 27.46 inhg following peak intensity kujira would begin to track northwest and oscillate in strength cresting an additional two times in intensity on april 21 the typhoon was downgraded to tropical storm intensity and began to track erratically for several days east of taiwan however on april 24 kujira would resume a northward track and begin to weaken and on april 24 was downgraded to tropical depression strength as it made landfall on kyushu following landfall kujira transitioned into an extratropical cyclone on april 25 which persisted until crossing the international dateline towards the end of april 2003
shortly after developing kujira caused two fatalities in pohnpei in addition to minor agricultural and infrastructural damage similar effects were felt in guam several days later the typhoon prompted cyclone warnings and other precautionary measures in the philippines after forecasts indicated the potential for strong winds and rain however ultimately any effects in the archipelago associated with kujira remained minimal the typhoon also prompted warning products in taiwan making it the first april typhoon since 1978 to cause such a feat unlike in the philippines however kujira would bring significant rainfall to taiwan effects from the typhoon were most significant in japan particularly in the ryukyu islands strong winds rain and waves caused us 230,000 ¥ 27.8 million in agricultural damage on ishigaki island one person was killed due to injuries resulting from the waves in kyushu heavy rainfall peaking at 196 mm 7.7 in in ōita prefecture was reported overall despite its distance away from land and weak intensity at the time of its sole landfall kujira resulted in three fatalities
midday on may 18 the jtwc began to monitor an area of persistent disturbed weather associated with a broad low-pressure area southwest of chuuk within highly conductive conditions the disturbance quickly organized and became classified as a tropical depression at 0000 utc the following day in its initial stages the depression tracked slowly northeastwards however a shortwave trough forced a weakness in a nearby ridge allowing for the storm to take a more streamlined northward path at 1200 utc on may 20 the jma upgraded the depression to tropical storm chan-hom following the system's naming chan-hom temporarily meandered towards the northwest before resuming its northeasterly track the next day the storm began to develop an eye this was reflected with an upgrade by the jma to typhoon status at 0600 utc on may 23 gradual intensification followed and at 1800 utc that day chan-hom reached its peak intensity with maximum sustained winds of 155 km h 100 mph and a minimum pressure of 940 mbar hpa 27.76 inhg
following peak intensity chan-hom began to intake dry air beginning on may 25 at roughly the same time the typhoon began to weaken and accelerate towards the northeast conditions continued to worsen as the storm moved further north and as the cyclone passed east of minamitorishima it was downgraded to tropical storm classification by this time chan-hom had lost much of its convection due to wind shear early on may 27 chan-hom had fully transitioned into an extratropical cyclone and these remnants continued to track towards the northeast these extratropical remnants dissipated south of the aleutian islands the following day early in the typhoon's existence chan-hom posed a potential threat to guam but remained well east of the island however after passing to the northeast winds from the typhoon fanned volcanic ash from the recently erupting anatahan volcano towards the island prompting precautionary measures in guam ashfalls were reported on the island forcing the cancellation of several flights as a tropical storm chan-hom caused some damage to homes and crops on chuuk mostly due to heavy rains brought forth by the storm offshore a 1,040 ton fishing vessel the nien feioch sank during the storm the ship was valued at 16 million
tropical storm linfa developed as a tropical depression just off the western coast of luzon on may 25 the disturbance quickly intensified to reach tropical storm intensity a few hours after cyclogenesis however intensification leveled off as linfa executed a small clockwise loop before a subsequent landfall on luzon on may 27 due to land interaction the storm temporarily weakened and decoupled before reforming in the philippine sea afterwards linfa began reintensifying and reached its peak intensity on may 29 with maximum sustained winds of 100 km h 65 mph and a barometric pressure of 980 mbar hpa 28.94 inhg following its peak the tropical storm began to deteriorate and transitioned into an extratropical cyclone on may 30 these extratropical remnants continued to track northward through japan before dissipating in the sea of okhotsk on june 4
the erratic and slow movement of linfa off the western philippines was the catalyst for extreme rainfall and flooding killing 41 persons in the archipelago precipitation peaked at 723 mm 28.5 in near dagupan rising floodwaters resulted in the temporary shutdown of government offices and numerous mudslides in addition strong winds caused widespread power outages overall damage from linfa in the philippines amounted to  192.3 million us 3.65 million the floods also displaced 8,367 people in 1,686 families and destroyed 178 homes linfa and its extratropical remnants later brought torrential rainfall and widespread flooding to japan particularly in southwestern regions rainfall there peaked at 727 mm 28.62 in flood damage was worst in kōchi and tokushima prefectures where several buildings were destroyed by floodwater other locations in japan experienced considerable agricultural damage as well as numerous landslides overall linfa caused roughly 28.2 million in damage much of which occurred in japan though the entirety of deaths associated with the cyclone took place in the philippines
in late may an area of disturbed weather began to persist in the south china sea the jtwc began to monitor the storm cluster on may 29 the following day the jma reclassified the system as a tropical depression initially the system remained highly disorganized due to the lack of deep convection persistent moderate wind shear and dry air prevented the cyclone from strengthening significantly in the storm's early stages these conditions abated as the depression tracked northeast and at 0000 utc on june 1 the jma upgraded the system to tropical storm nangka throughout the course of the day nangka continued to strengthen as it accelerated northeast and peaked in strength with a barometric pressure of 985 mbar hpa 29.09 inhg and maximum sustained winds of 95 km h 60 mph making it a severe tropical storm
however upon moving through the bashi channel conditions began to deteriorate due to increased wind shear weakening the system and resulting in its downgrade to tropical depression status by the jma at 1200 utc on june 3 nangka continued to become increasingly disorganized as it moved further north and late that day the depression transitioned to an extratropical cyclone the resulting remnants continued to track well east of japan before dissipating on june 7 due to its track away from landmasses damage remained minimal however as nangka passed to the south and east of japan the storm brought light rainfall to the country peaking at 81 mm 3.2 in in minamidaitō okinawa
a tropical disturbance persisted in the monsoon trough northwest of pohnpei on june 7 and moved westward without development due to wind shear on june 11 the shear decreased enough to allow the convection to organize and the next day the jma classified it as a tropical depression northeast of palau on june 13 the jma upgraded it to tropical storm soudelor to the east of the philippines and pagasa gave it the local name egay soudelor moved to the northwest and later to the north parallel to the eastern philippines and on june 17 the jma upgraded it to typhoon status the storm rapidly intensified to the east of taiwan as it developed a well-defined eye and while doing so passed over the japanese island of iriomote-jima at around 2030 utc on june 17 at 0600 utc on june 18 the jtwc estimated peak 1 minute winds of 215 km h 135 mph while the jma estimated peak 10 minute winds of 150 km h 90 mph increased shear weakened the typhoon to tropical storm strengthen on june 19 and later that day the jma declared the storm as extratropical near the oki islands the extratropical remnants of soudelor continued to the northeast crossing northern japan on june 20 and dissipating on june 24
while offshore the philippines soudelor dropped heavy rainfall that caused flooding and left thousands homeless the storm caused  131 million php 2.46 million usd in damage and 12 deaths on the japanese island of iriomote-jima where wind gusts reached 204 km h 127 mph it also affected taiwan where floods covered highways and caused mudslides in japan the storm caused widespread power outages although damage was minimal and there were 21 injuries in south korea there was 12.1 million in damage and two deaths
on july 15 the jma estimated that a tropical depression formed and the next day the jtwc initiated advisories on tropical depression 09w about 665 km 415 mi east of yap a subtropical ridge near okinawa steered the nascent depression to the west-northwest for much of its duration with warm waters and favorable upper-level conditions the depression quickly organized first to tropical storm imbudo on july 17 and to typhoon status two days later when pagasa begin issuing advisories on typhoon harurot around that time imbudo was rapidly intensifying developing a well-defined eye at 1200 utc on july 20 the jma estimated peak 10 minute sustained winds of 165 km h 105 mph and the same time the jtwc estimated 1 minute sustained winds of 240 km h 150 mph making it a super typhoon imbudo maintained peak winds for about 12 hours before undergoing an eyewall replacement cycle at 0300 utc on july 22 imbudo struck northern luzon with 1 minute winds estimated at 205 km h 125 mph by the jtwc it weakened over land but re-intensified in the south china sea striking southern china near yangjiang guangdong on july 24 imbudo rapidly weakened dissipating on july 25
in the philippines officials evacuated over 14,000 people imbudo was the strongest typhoon to strike since typhoon zeb five years prior the typhoon left widespread areas flooded for several days damage was heaviest in the cagayan valley where over 80,000 people were displaced by the storm in isabela high winds wrecked most of the banana crop and severely damaged other crops throughout the philippines imbudo damaged or destroyed 62,314 houses causing p4.7 billion 2003 php 86 million 2003 usd in damage there were 64 deaths in the country in southern china in yangjiang more than 30,000 people evacuated ahead of the storm and more than half of the trees in the city fell due to strong winds high winds killed a man in hong kong after knocking him off a platform throughout guangdong imbudo destroyed 595,000 houses and caused eight deaths heavy rains spread across southern china peaking at 343 mm 13.5 in at hepu county in guangxi province there 12 people died from the storm overall damage in china was about ¥ 4.45 billion cny 297 million usd
koni originated from a tropical depression situated within the monsoon trough to the east of the philippines on july 15 tracking westward intensification was slow and the system remained a tropical depression as it moved across the central philippines on july 17 upon moving into the south china sea conditions allowed for quicker strengthening and the cyclone reached tropical storm status on july 18 before reaching its peak intensity with maximum sustained winds of 110 km h 70 mph making it a severe tropical storm however atmospheric conditions began to deteriorate as koni made landfall on hainan on july 21 weakening the system the tropical storm continued to weaken as it moved over the gulf of tonkin prior to a final landfall near hanoi vietnam the following day tracking inland the combination of land interaction and wind shear caused koni to dissipate over laos on july 23
shortly after development koni tracked through the philippines killing two people after moving into the south china sea turbulence produced by the storm resulted in an aviation incident involving a commercial airliner off the western philippines three of the plane's occupants received minor injuries in hainan koni caused heavy rainfall peaking at 189 mm 7.44 in at a station on wuzhi mountain the rains resulted in the collapse of 1,400 homes and an estimated cn ¥ 140.27 million us 16.9 million in direct economic losses effects were worst in vietnam where three people were killed widespread power outages occurred and strong winds resulted in agricultural and infrastructural damage particularly in vietnam's northern provinces
morakot spawned from an area of disturbed weather in the philippine sea on july 31 tracking northwest favorable conditions allowed for the intensification of the system to tropical storm strength on august 2 morakot reached peak intensity later that day with winds of 85 km h 50 mph and a minimum barometric pressure of 992 mbar hpa 28.29 inhg this intensity was held for several hours until less conducive atmospheric conditions slightly weakened the system this was followed by morakot making landfall on southern taiwan on august 3 subsequently the storm weakened and moved into the taiwan strait before making its final landfall near quanzhou china the next day the storm quickly weakened over the chinese mainland and dissipated entirely several hours after landfall
in taiwan where morakot first made landfall heavy rainfall resulted in flooding commercial flights schools and rail service in some areas was cancelled in advance of the storm precipitation there peaked at 653 mm 25.71 in over a period of nearly two days in taitung county crop damage also resulted from the rainfall and was estimated at over nt 70 million us 2 million in china record rainfall was reported the worst impacted city was quanzhou where losses due to morakot reached cn ¥ 240 million us 29 million and one death was reported power outages were also widespread across southeastern china due to preexisting drought conditions 703 cloud seeding operations took place in order to artificially generate added rainfall such operations resulted in moderate precipitation over the targeted area overall morakot caused roughly 31 million in damage and three deaths
a tropical depression developed on august 2 southeast of guam and gradually intensified while moving to the northwest becoming a tropical storm on august 3 and a typhoon a day later etau formed an eye and became a large storm by the time it approached okinawa on august 7 the typhoon attained peak winds of 155 km h 100 mph before weakening slightly while turning to the northeast etau made landfall on the japanese island of shikoku on august 8 and later moved across portions of honshu and hokkaido after weakening to tropical storm status the cyclone became extratropical on august 9 and dissipated three days later
while passing northeast of the philippines the typhoon caused light damage in the archipelago the eye crossed over okinawa where etau left 166,800 people without power and caused 10 injuries near where etau first struck japan muroto reported a peak wind gust of 166 km h 103 mph at the time the third strongest on record there the typhoon also dropped torrential rainfall peaking at 683 mm 26.9 in the combination of winds and rainfall caused landslides particularly on hokkaido nationwide etau killed 20 people destroyed 708 houses and caused ¥ 35.1 billion jpy 294.8 million usd in damage
krovanh originated from a tropical disturbance within the monsoon trough east of chuuk state on august 13 despite rather favorable conditions the initial tropical depression did not intensify significantly and degenerated into a remnant low on august 18 however these remnants were able to reorganize and the system was reclassified as a tropical cyclone a day later intensification was rather rapid upon the storm's reformation–the depression reached tropical storm status on august 20 and then typhoon intensity two days later shortly after krovanh made landfall on luzon at peak intensity with winds of 120 km h 75 mph the typhoon emerged into the south china sea as a much weaker tropical storm though it was able to restrengthen over warm waters once again at typhoon intensity krovanh clipped hainan before moving over the leizhou peninsula on its way to a final landfall near cm phả vietnam on august 25 quick weakening due to land interaction occurred as krovanh moved across northern vietnam where the storm met its demise the following day
krovanh first struck the philippines resulting in heavy rainfall and displacing approximately 1,000 families the flooding caused severe damage and killed one person krovanh's effects were much more severe in china in hong kong eleven people were injured and isolated flooding occurred as a result of the typhoon's outer rainbands however guangdong province hainan province and guangxi were the chinese regions most extensively impacted the typhoon brought record wind gusts into guangxi in those three regions combined 13,000 homes were estimated to have collapsed and a large swath of farmland was damaged two people were killed in china and economic losses approximated to ¥ 2.1 billion us 253 million due to its positioning and track of all areas in vietnam only the country's more northern regions were impacted by krovanh flash flooding occurred in earnest in those regions and 1,000 homes were flattened one person was killed and five others were injured in vietnam overall the typhoon was responsible for the deaths of four persons
the monsoon trough spawned several tropical disturbances in the middle of august one of which became tropical depression lakay near the philippines on august 18 an area of convection persisted on the southern side of a circulation developing into a tropical depression east of luzon it moved quickly northward and later to the northwest in an area generally unfavorable for strengthening such as the presence of wind shear and land interaction on august 19 the jma upgraded the depression to tropical storm vamco to the east of taiwan later that day the circulation passed just 55 km 35 mi north of taipei although the convection was exposed that time on august 20 the jma assessed vamco as dissipating in the taiwan strait although the jtwc continued advisories until the storm moved ashore in southeastern china
rainfall in taiwan reached 69 mm 2.7 in in ilan county on the island the storm left several hundred houses without power due to a lightning strike on mainland china rainfall peaked at 101 mm 4.0 in in wenzhou zhejiang which were largely beneficial in easing drought conditions while winds gusted to 100 km h 62 mph the storm damaged or destroyed 5,880 houses and flooded 1,287 ha 3,180 acres of paddy fields causing ¥ 38.6 million cny 4.7 million usd in damage
on august 27 a tropical depression developed about 520 km 325 mi northwest of guam which initially drifted to the southwest before turning to the northwest on august 29 the jma upgraded it to tropical storm dujuan and that day pagasa began issuing advisories on tropical storm onyok the storm quickly intensified into a typhoon after developing an eye in the center on september 1 the jma estimated dujuan attained peak 10 minute winds of 150 km h 90 mph and the jtwc assessed peak 1–minute winds of 230 km h 145 mph while near peak intensity the center of dujuan passed about 45 km 30 mi south of the southern tip of taiwan the typhoon weakened steadily and was a severe tropical storm by the time it made landfall on september 2 just east of hong kong the jtwc estimated landfall winds of 185 km h 115 mph making it the strongest typhoon to strike the pearl river delta since typhoon hope in 1979 dujuan rapidly weakened while continuing westward through china dissipating on september 3 over guangxi
in the philippines dujuan interacted with the monsoon to produce heavy rainfall killing one person while in the vicinity dujuan produced gusts of 100 km h 62 mph on yonaguni a japanese subdivision of okinawa heavy rainfall in taiwan reached 628 mm 24.7 in in pingtung county and winds peaked at 176 km h 109 mph on orchid island before the anemometer was destroyed the caused about nt 200 nwd 115 million usd in crop damage and killed three people damage was minor in hong kong and four fishermen were missing and presumed drowned after their boat sank on the chinese mainland strong winds left 90 of the city of shenzen without power and killed 16 construction workers due to a half-finished building collapsing across guangdong the typhoon damaged crops and destroyed 54,000 homes were destroyed overall damage in china was estimated at ¥ 2.3 billion cny 277 million usd and across guangdong the typhoon killed 40 people
typhoon maemi formed on september 4 from the monsoon trough in the western pacific ocean it slowly intensified into a tropical storm while moving northwestward and maemi became a typhoon on september 8 that day it quickly intensified due to favorable conditions developing a well-defined eye and reaching peak maximum sustained winds of 195 km h 120 mph while near peak intensity maemi was decelerating and began turning to the north-northeast the eyewall soon after passed over the japanese island of miyako-jima on september 10 producing the fourth lowest pressure on record in japan after a pressure of 912 mbar 26.9 inhg was recorded with warm waters maemi was able to maintain much of its intensity before it made landfall just west of busan south korea on september 12 on jeju island maemi produced a peak wind gust of 216 km h 134 mph and a minimum pressure of 950 mbar 28 inhg both setting records for the country and making it the most powerful typhoon to strike south korea since record-keeping began in the country in 1904 the typhoon became extratropical in the sea of japan the next day although the remnants persisted for several more days bringing strong winds to northern japan
the typhoon first affected the ryukyu islands of japan on miyako-jima strong winds damaged 104 buildings and 95 of residents lost power maemi dropped heavy rainfall there including rates of 58.5 mm 2.30 in in an hour and 402.5 mm 15.85 in in 24 hours the latter setting a record one person died on miyako-jima after being struck by flying glass elsewhere in japan the storm caused flights to be canceled while rainfall-induced landslides blocked roads there were two other deaths in japan and damage totaled ¥ 11.3 billion jpy 96 million usd damage was heaviest in south korea notably where it moved ashore winds in busan near the landfall location reached 154 km h 96 mph the second-highest on record there the port sustained heavy damage causing disruptions to exports in the months following the storm nationwide the high winds destroyed about 5,000 houses and damaged 13,000 homes and businesses leaving 25,000 people homeless about 1.47 million lost power and widespread crop damage occurred resulting in the worst rice crop in 23 years across south korea maemi killed 117 people and overall damage totaled  5.52 trillion won 4.8 billion usd
in the middle of september the monsoon trough spawned a rapidly organizing disturbance east-northeast of luzon with weak wind shear and favorable conditions on september 16 the jma classified it as a tropical depression and the jtwc initiated advisories the next day the system moved to the northwest due to the subtropical ridge to the northeast and later to the north on september 18 the jma upgraded the depression to tropical storm choi-wan the same day that pagasa classified it as tropical storm roskas an eastward-moving trough turned the storm to the northeast bringing the track over okinawa and amami ōshima on september 19 choi-wan continued gradually intensifying becoming a typhoon on september 20 to the southeast of japan that day the jma estimated peak winds of 130 km h 80 mph and the jtwc estimated peak 1 minute winds of 185 km h 115 mph on september 21 after choi-wan developed a well-defined eye the typhoon weakened due to increasing wind shear deteriorating to severe tropical storm status on september 22 before jma declared it extratropical on september 23 the remnants of choi-wan continued to the northeast exited the basin on september 24 and eventually struck southern alaska on september 25
wind gusts in okinawa reached 115 km h 72 mph while on the volcanic island of hachijō-jima gusts reached 214 km h 133 mph on the japanese mainland winds gusted to 126 km h 78 mph at chōshi chiba choi-wan dropped heavy rainfall while near japan peaking at 316 mm 12.4 in on miyake-jima in okinawa choi-wan flooded a boat forcing its occupants to be rescued by the coast guard also on the island heavy rainfall caused landslides and flooded houses in amami ōshima the storm left 10,810 people without power on hachijō wind gusts of 214 km h 133 mph damaged about 200 houses nationwide choi-wan destroyed 191 homes injured 9 people and left about ¥ 300 million jpy 2.5 million usd
towards the end of september the monsoon trough spawned a tropical disturbance east-northeast of yap which became a tropical depression on september 24 there were initially several circulations with a tropical upper tropospheric trough to the northeast increasing outflow after slowing and turning to the northeast the depression intensified into tropical storm koppu on september 26 after the storm developed a large eye feature the jtwc upgraded it to typhoon status on september 27 although the jma did not follow suit until the following day while near chichi-jima also that day koppu passed 95 km 60 mi west of iwo jima and the jma estimated peak 10 minute winds of 130 km h 80 mph the jtwc estimated peak 1 minute winds of 165 km h 105 mph before an approaching trough caused the typhoon to accelerate northeastward the convection diminished near the center causing koppu to become extratropical on september 30 the remnants continued generally northeastward through the aleutian islands eventually passing south of mainland alaska on october 7
on chichi-jima typhoon koppu produced sustained winds of 102 km h 63 mph with gusts to 200 km h 124 mph which was the third strongest on record for the station rainfall there reached 183 mm 7.2 in wind gusts on iwo jima peaked at 109 km h 68 mph
in the middle of october an area of convection persisted along the monsoon trough between luzon and guam developing into a tropical depression on october 17 the same monsoon trough later spawned typhoon parma to the east for several days the system remained disorganized while drifting to the west-northwest due to weak steering currents south of the subtropical ridge on october 19 the jma upgraded the depression to tropical storm ketsana and by that time the storm had begun drifting to the northeast with favorable outflow ketsana quickly intensified into a typhoon on october 20 after developing an eye and two days later the jma estimated peak winds of 165 km h 105 mph the jtwc estimated peak 1 minute winds of 230 km h 145 mph around the time the well-defined eye had expanded to 37 km 23 mi subsequently the typhoon accelerated northeastward into the westerlies and began weakening due to increasing wind shear and dry air on october 26 ketsana became extratropical to the east of japan and dissipated the next day the passage of the typhoon caused surface chlorophyll a concentration in the ocean to increase 30-fold
the same monsoon trough that spawned typhoon koppu also produced an area of convection to the north-northeast of guam becoming a tropical depression on october 19 the system moved northwestward and later turned to the northeast around the subtropical ridge with low wind shear and favorable outflow the convection became better organized and the jma upgraded it to tropical storm parma on october 21 after an eye began to form parma was upgraded to typhoon status the next day an approaching trough caused parma to accelerate northeastward while also increasing outflow on october 24 the jma estimated peak winds of 175 km h 110 mph while the jtwc estimated winds of 240 km h 150 mph an unusually high intensity for 30 ° n. subsequently parma rounded the subtropical ridge and began moving to the east-southeast beginning a nearly week-long loop the cold front had passed to the north and failed to bring the typhoon northeastward
increasing wind shear weakened the convection and parma deteriorated into a severe tropical storm on october 26 the next day it began moving westward while passing about 345 km 215 mi north of wake island a large eye of 110 km 70 mi in diameter developed and on october 28 the jma re-upgraded parma to typhoon status the next day the typhoon turned to the northeast due to another approaching trough with decreasing wind shear and warmer waters parma re-intensified significantly on october 29 reaching a secondary peak of 165 km h 105 mph according to jma and 215 km h 135 mph according to jtwc the storm moved very closely along the track it took several days prior increasing wind shear on october 30 caused rapid weakening resulting in the eye dissipating by the next day the center was exposed and parma became extratropical later exiting the basin on november 1 the remnants weakened later turning to the southeast and dissipating on november 11 southwest of california
late in october an area of convection persisted northwest of palau and quickly organized into a tropical depression on october 29 moving west-northwestward toward the philippines due to a ridge to the east the depression intensified into tropical storm melor on october 30 with minimal wind shear the storm strengthened further and developed a large eye the jtwc upgraded melor to typhoon status on october 31 estimating peak 1 minute winds of 140 km h 85 mph although the jma estimated the storm only attained peak 10 minute winds of 95 km h 60 mph early on november 1 melor made landfall on northeastern luzon in the philippines south of palanan the storm weakened over land and emerged into the south china sea by that time it was moving northward along the periphery of the ridge to the east on november 2 melor turned to the northeast passing just east of taiwan the next day it weakened to tropical depression status and after meandering offshore eastern taiwan melor continued northeastward it became extratropical on november 5 and dissipated the next day near southern japan
in the philippines melor dropped about 150 mm 6 in of rainfall which flooded the cagayan river and killed four people in taiwan rainfall reached 554 mm 21.8 in in pingtung county on the japanese island of hateruma rainfall totaled 197 mm 7.8 in which broke the hourly and daily record for the station in november
a tropical depression developed near yap on november 11 the system intensified gradually as it tracked quickly westward toward the philippines an anticyclone aloft allowed for strengthening and the jma upgraded the depression to tropical storm nepartak on november 12 simultaneously the cyclone entered the area of responsibility of the philippine atmospheric geophysical and astronomical services administration which named it tropical storm weng at around 1600 utc on november 13 nepartak made landfall on northern samar island in the philippines before traversing the remainder of the archipelago from east to west the cyclone emerged into the south china sea weakened but quickly re-intensified while continuing to the west-northwest the jtwc estimated peak winds of 140 km h 85 mph on november 16 and later that day the jma upgraded the storm to typhoon status estimating peak 10-minute winds of 120 km h 75 mph on november 18 nepartak passed near southwestern hainan and weakened with the convection diminishing from the circulation by the next day the system weakened to tropical depression status and dissipated shortly after moving ashore over beihai china
in the philippines nepartak produced strong winds heavy rainfall and rough seas the storm caused widespread power outages and ferry disruptions according to the pagasa in its post-storm report a total of 13 people lost their lives during the storm on hainan the storm helped end one of the worst summer droughts in almost 65 years although it also left heavy crop damage wrecking 64,000 ha 160,000 acres of fields and killing 400 head of livestock with about 800 homes destroyed damage on hainan amounted to 197 million 2003 usd effects were minor in mainland china
typhoon lupit formed on november 18 from the monsoon trough to the west of the marshall islands early in its duration it moved generally to the west or west-southwest on november 21 the depression intensified into tropical storm lupit and two days later it strengthened into a typhoon developing an eye lupit later began a prolonged movement to the northwest during which it passed near several islands in yap state the typhoon reached peak intensity on november 26 with peak 10–minute sustained winds of 185 km h 115 mph it later weakened due to a variety of unfavorable conditions and after recurving to the northeast lupit became extratropical south of japan on december 2
typhoon lupit first affected pohnpei with gusty winds and later it damaged or destroyed about 200 homes in chuuk state there high waves flooded roads and homes while high winds damaged crops damage was heaviest in yap state mostly in the small ulithi atoll and fais island on both islands the typhoon contaminated the water supply and wrecked the crops rainfall reached 263 mm 10.35 in on ulithi and gusts reached 158 km h 98 mph throughout the fsm damage totaled about 1.7 million although there were no deaths the damage prompted the fsm government to declare two states as disaster areas as well as a disaster declaration from the united states federal government while lupit was becoming extratropical it became the first typhoon in december to threaten japan in 13 years the storm dropped rainfall that resulted in mudslides and flight cancellations
an area of convection formed on may 16 to the southwest of palau located within an area of weak wind shear the next day the jma and the jtwc both classified the system as a tropical depression the convection was disorganized in association with multiple circulation centers although it gradually organized moving westward initially the depression turned more to the north into an area of increasing wind shear on may 19 the jtwc upgraded the system to tropical storm 03w and on the same day pagasa classified it as tropical depression batibot soon after the convection decreased from the center and by may 20 all warning agencies had discontinued advisories
on july 9 pagasa classified a system as tropical depression falcon off the west coast of the philippines the jma also briefly initiated advisories before dropping them later on july 9 later in the month pagasa briefly issued advisories on tropical depression ineng on july 30 off the east coast of mindanao the depression dissipated the next day causing about p8 million php 145,000 usd in damage the monsoon trough spawned a tropical depression north of luzon on august 18 with pagasa naming it lakay there were several circulations in the region with tropical storm vamco to the northeast near taiwan and the overall system moved generally westward pagasa briefly classified lakay as a tropical storm on august 19 before ending advisories the next day the system spread rainfall across china reaching 82.4 mm 3.24 in in xiamen fujuan
on september 5 former hurricane jimena crossed the international date line into the basin by that time the circulation was largely exposed from the convection and the center quickly dissipated later in the month the monsoon trough spawned a disturbance east of the philippines that pagasa classified as tropical depression quiel on september 15 the system moved westward but never intensified dissipating west of luzon on september 19 the broad system also spawned typhoon choi-wan
in october the jtwc classified tropical depression 18w early in the month off the west coast of luzon with weak steering currents the system moved slowly southwestward before looping to the northwest on october 10 the depression dissipated just off the coast of southern china on october 5 the jma monitored a tropical depression southeast of taiwan that later passed near the island producing heavy rainfall that peaked at 153 mm 6.0 in in ilan county a few days later the jtwc monitored tropical depression 19w which developed on october 12 after an extratropical storm produced an area of convection described as a subtropical low the depression moved generally northeastward toward japan due to an approaching cold front the depression moved through kyushu and honshu before dissipating on october 13 the depression dropped 285 mm 11.2 in of rainfall in kōchi while strong winds associated reached 217 km h 135 mph through a storm-produced downburst the winds knocked over two cranes killing two people and left about 9,000 homes without power the depression also killed two people due to drownings on october 16 the jma briefly classified a tropical depression to the east of the marianas islands on october 22 a tropical depression developed in the south china sea classified by pagasa as ursula the system moved eastward and crossed palawan before dissipating on october 24 in the philippines the depression killed one person and caused minor damage also in october the monsoon trough spawned a tropical depression in the gulf of thailand which moved northwestward and crossed into the indian ocean dropping heavy rainfall in thailand
in mid-november the jma briefly tracked a weak tropical depression near wake island the agency also briefly tracked a tropical depression off the coast of vietnam on december 16 it finally dissipated on december 17 with the pressure and winds unknown the final system of the year was a tropical depression that originated out of the monsoon trough on december 24 east of the philippines after initially moving to the west it turned to the south and the jtwc estimated the depression intensified into a tropical storm during this time pagasa classified it as tropical storm zigzag the system made landfall in northeastern mindanao and dissipated on december 27 bringing heavy rainfall
within the north-western pacific ocean both the japan meteorological agency jma and the philippine atmospheric geophysical and astronomical services administration assign names to tropical cyclones that develop in the western pacific which can result in a tropical cyclone having two names the japan meteorological agency's rsmc tokyo — typhoon center assigns international names to tropical cyclones on behalf of the world meteorological organization's typhoon committee should they be judged to have 10-minute sustained windspeeds of 65 km h 40 mph while the philippine atmospheric geophysical and astronomical services administration assigns names to tropical cyclones which move into or form as a tropical depression in their area of responsibility located between 135 ° e and 115 ° e and between 5 ° n-25 ° n even if the cyclone has had an international name assigned to it the names of significant tropical cyclones are retired by both pagasa and the typhoon committee should the list of names for the philippine region be exhausted then names will be taken from an auxiliary list of which the first ten are published each season unused names are marked in gray
during the season 21 named tropical cyclones developed in the western pacific and were named by the japan meteorological agency when it was determined that they had become tropical storms these names were contributed to a list of a 140 names submitted by the fourteen members nations and territories of the escap wmo typhoon committee
the philippine atmospheric geophysical and astronomical services administration uses its own naming scheme for tropical cyclones in their area of responsibility pagasa assigns names to tropical depressions that form within their area of responsibility and any tropical cyclone that might move into their area of responsibility should the list of names for a given year prove to be insufficient names are taken from an auxiliary list the first 10 of which are published each year before the season starts the names not retired from this list will be used again in the 2007 season names that were not assigned are marked in gray
the names imbudo and maemi were retired by the escap wmo typhoon committee the names molave and mujigae were chosen to replace imbudo and maemi respectively while yanyan was requested by hong kong to be removed in the list and was replaced by dolphin the philippine atmospheric geophysical and astronomical services administration pagasa announced that the name harurot had its name retired due to extensive damage the name hanna was chosen to replace harurot also the name koni was replaced by goni after it was found that koni was a misspelling
the following table provides basic meteorological and impact information for each tropical cyclone from the 2003 pacific typhoon season in tabular format unnamed tropical cyclones are not included pagasa names for storms are provided in parentheses storms entering from the central pacific only include their information while in the western pacific and are noted with an asterisk
an oxaziridine is an organic molecule that features a three-membered heterocycle containing oxygen nitrogen and carbon in their largest application oxazidines are intermediates in the industrial production of hydrazine oxaziridine derivatives are also used as specialized reagents in organic chemistry for a variety of oxidations including alpha hydroxylation of enolates epoxidation and aziridination of olefins and other heteroatom transfer reactions oxaziridines also serve as precursors to amides and participate in 3 2 cycloadditions with various heterocumulenes to form substituted five-membered heterocycles chiral oxaziridine derivatives effect asymmetric oxygen transfer to prochiral enolates as well as other substrates some oxaziridines also have the property of a high barrier to inversion of the nitrogen allowing for the possibility of chirality at the nitrogen center
oxaziridine derivatives were first reported in the mid-1950s by emmons and subsequently by krimm and horner and jürgens whereas oxygen and nitrogen typically act as nucleophiles due to their high electronegativity oxaziridines allow for electrophilic transfer of both heteroatoms this unusual reactivity is due to the presence of the highly strained three membered ring and the relatively weak n-o bond nucleophiles tend to attack at the aziridine nitrogen when the nitrogen substituent is small r1 h and at the oxygen atom when the nitrogen substituent has greater steric bulk the unusual electronics of the oxaziridine system may be exploited to perform a number of oxygen and nitrogen transfer reactions including but not limited to α-hydroxylation of enolates epoxidation of alkenes selective oxidation of sulfides and selenides amination of n-nucleophiles and n-acylamidation
the peroxide process for the industrial production of hydrazine through the oxidation of ammonia with hydrogen peroxide in the presence of ketones was developed in the early 1970s
chiral camphorsulfonyloxaziridines proved useful in the syntheses of complex natural product such as taxol which is marketed as a chemotherapy agent both the holton taxol total synthesis and the wender taxol total synthesis feature asymmetric α-hydroxylation with camphorsulfonyloxaziridine
the two main approaches to synthesis of n-h n-alkyl and n-aryloxaziridines are oxidation of imines with peracids a and amination of carbonyls b
additionally oxidation of chiral imines and oxidation of imines with chiral peracids may yield enantiopure oxaziridines some oxaziridines have the unique property of configurationally stable nitrogen atoms at room temperature due to an inversion barrier of 24 to 31 kcal mol enantiopure oxaziridines where stereochemistry is entirely due to configurationally stable nitrogen are reported
in the late 1970s and early 1980s franklin a. davis synthesized the first n-sulfonyloxaziridines which act exclusively as oxygen transfer reagents and are the most predominantly used class of oxaziridines today while originally synthesized with mcpba and the phase transfer catalyst benzyltrimethylammonium chloride an improved synthesis using oxone as the oxidant is now most prevalent
many n-sulfonyloxaziridines are used today each with slightly different properties and reactivity these reagents are summarized in the table below
with highly electron withdrawing perfluoroalkyl substituents oxaziridines exhibit reactivity more similar to that of dioxiranes than typical oxaziridines notably perfluoroalkyloxaziridines hydroxylate certain c-h bonds with high selectivity perfluorinated oxaziridines may be synthesized by subjecting a perfluorinated imine to perfluoromethyl fluorocarbonyl peroxide and a metal fluoride to act as an hf scavenger
oxaziridines are intermediates in the peroxide process for the production of hydrazine many millions of kilograms of hydrazine are produced annually by this method that involves a step wherein ammonia is oxidized in the presence of methyl ethyl ketone to give the oxaziridine
me et c o nh3 h2o2 → me et conh h2o
in subsequent steps the oxaziridine is converted to the hydrazone which is the immediate en route to hydrazine
me et conh nh3 → me et c nnh2 h2o
α-hydroxyketones or acyloins are an important synthetic motifs present in many natural products. α-hydroxyketones have been synthesized in many ways including reduction of α-diketones substitution of a hydroxyl for a leaving group and direct oxidation of an enolate oxodiperoxymolybdenum pyridine hexamethylphosphoric triamide mooph and n-sulfonyloxaziridines are the most common electrophilic sources of oxygen implemented in this process one advantage of using n-sulfonyloxaziridines is that higher chiral induction is almost invariably observed relative to mooph and other oxidants high yield 77-91 and dr 95 5 99 1 are reported for α-hydroxylation with the evans'chiral auxiliary with n-sulfonyloxaziridine as the electrophile chiral induction has been demonstrated with many other chiral ketones and ketones with chiral auxiliaries including samp and ramp
extensive work has been reported on asymmetric hydroxylation of prochiral enolates with camphorsulfonyloxaziridine derivatives achieving moderate to high enantiomeric excess the commonly accepted proposed transition state that justifies this stereochemical outcome involves an open transition state where the steric bulk of r1 determines the face of approach
the selectivity of some hydroxylations may be drastically improved in some cases with the addition of coordinating groups alpha to the oxaziridine ring as oxaziridines 3b and 3c in the table above in these instances it is proposed that the reaction proceeds through a closed transition state where the metal oxyanion is stabilized by chelation from the sulfate and coordinating groups on the camphor skeleton
α-hydroxylation with oxaziridines has been widely implemented in total synthesis it is a key step in both the holton taxol total synthesis and the wender taxol total synthesis additionally forsyth implemented the transformation in his synthesis of the c3-c14 substituted 1,7-dioxaspiro 5.5 undec-3-ene system of okadaic acid
epoxidation of alkenes is a common reaction because epoxides can be derivatized in a number of useful ways classically laboratory epoxidation is carried out with mcpba or other peracids oxaziridines have been found to be useful for the formation of highly acid sensitive epoxides − -chaetominine was synthesized via oxaziridine epoxidation as a late stage transformation as seen below
another transformation of high synthetic utility is asymmetric epoxidation a number of asymmetric epoxidations exist the sharpless epoxidation the jacobsen-katsuki epoxidation and the juliá-colonna epoxidation these methods require specific functionality in order to achieve selectivity the sharpless epoxidation is specific to allylic alcohols the jacobsen epoxidation requires cis-disubstituted aryl alkenes and the juliá epoxidation requires α-β unsaturated ketones chiral oxaziridines act stereospecifically on many unfunctionalized alkenes it has even possible to effect stereospecific epoxidation catalytically in the oxaziridine chiral unit further investigation into these reactions may be required before levels of enantiometic excess become practical for large scale synthesis lusinichi et al. have investigated asymmetric epoxidation with a chiral oxaziridinium salt using oxone as the stoichiometric oxidant seen below
perfluorinated oxaziridines are known to hydroxylate unactivated hydrocarbons with remarkable regio and diastereospecificity this is a highly coveted transformation and similar reactivity and specificity is seldom rivaled especially considering the nonmetallic nature of the oxidant perfluorinated oxaziridines show high selectivity toward tertiary hydrogens hydroxylation of primary carbons and dihydroxylation of a compound with two oxidizable sites have never been observed retention of stereochemistry is very high often 95 98 retenton of stereochemistry may be further enhanced by the addition of a fluoride salt
oxaziridines with unsubstituted or acylated nitrogens are capable of nitrogen atom transfer although this reactivity has received considerably less attention
amination of nucleophiles with n-unsubstituted oxaziridines is quite versatile in the breadth of possible nucleophiles and corresponding products hydrazines may be derived from the amination of secondary or tertiary amines hydroxylamine and thiohydroxamines may be formed from their corresponding alcohols and thiols sulfimides may be formed from thioethers and α-aminoketones may be formed by attack of corresponding enolates
the transfer of acylated amines is more difficult than that of unsubstituted amines although unlike amine transfer by oxaziridines there are no alternative methods that directly transfer acylated amines acylamine transfer has primarily been performed using amines and hydrazines as nucleophiles very few transfers of acylated nitrogens to carbon nucleophiles have been successfully performed although some do exist in the literature
oxaziridines have been found to undergo rearrangement reactions via a radical mechanism when irradiated with uv light or in the presence of a single electron transfer reagent such as cui. spirocylic oxaziridines undergo ring expansions to the corresponding lactam interestingly the migrating substituent is determined by a stereoelectronic effect where the group trans to the lone pair on the nitrogen will always be the predominant migration product in light of this effect it is possible to take advantage of the chiral nitrogen due to high inversion barrier to direct the rearrangement this phenomenon is demonstrated by observed selectivities in the rearrangements below in the rearrangement on the left the thermodynamically unfavorable product is observed exclusively while in the reaction on the right the product derived from the less stable radical intermediate is favored
aubé takes advantage of this rearrangement as the key step in his synthesis of -yohimbine a natural medicine classified by the nih as possibly effective in the treatment of erectile dysfunction and the sexual problems caused by selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors
it is also notable that oxaziridines will thermally rearrange to nitrones cis-trans selectivity of the resulting nitrone is poor however yields are good to excellent it is thought that some oxaziridines racemize over time through a nitrone intermediate
oxaziridines undergo cycloaddition reactions with heterocumulenes to afford a number of unique five membered heterocycles as depicted in the figure below this reactivity is due to the strained three membered ring and weak n-o bond
the battle of dürenstein also known as the battle of dürrenstein battle of dürnstein and battle of diernstein german gefecht bei dürrenstein on 11 november 1805 was an engagement in the napoleonic wars during the war of the third coalition dürenstein modern dürnstein is located in the wachau valley on the river danube 73 kilometers 45 mi upstream from vienna austria the river makes a crescent-shaped curve between dürnstein and nearby krems an der donau and the battle was fought in the flood plain between the river and the mountains
at dürenstein a combined force of russian and austrian troops trapped a french division commanded by théodore maxime gazan the french division was part of the newly created viii corps the so-called corps mortier under command of édouard mortier in pursuing the austrian retreat from bavaria mortier had over-extended his three divisions along the north bank of the danube mikhail illarionovich kutuzov commander of the coalition force enticed mortier to send gazan's division into a trap and french troops were caught in a valley between two russian columns they were rescued by the timely arrival of a second division under command of pierre dupont de l 'étang the battle extended well into the night both sides claimed victory the french lost more than a third of their participants and gazan's division experienced over 40 percent losses the austrians and russians also had heavy losses--close to 16 percent--but perhaps the most significant was the death in action of johann heinrich von schmitt one of austria's most capable chiefs of staff
the battle was fought three weeks after the austrian capitulation at ulm and three weeks before the russo-austrian defeat at the battle of austerlitz after austerlitz austria withdrew from the war the french demanded a high indemnity and francis ii abdicated as holy roman emperor releasing the german states from their allegiance to the holy roman empire
in a series of conflicts from 1803-15 known as the napoleonic wars various european powers formed five coalitions against the first french empire like the wars sparked by the french revolution 1789 these further revolutionized the formation organization and training of european armies and led to an unprecedented militarization mainly due to mass conscription under the leadership of napoleon french power rose quickly as the grande armée conquered most of europe and collapsed rapidly after the disastrous invasion of russia in 1812 napoleon's empire ultimately suffered complete military defeat in the 1813–14 campaigns resulting in the restoration of the bourbon monarchy in france although napoleon made a spectacular return in 1815 known as the hundred days his defeat at the battle of waterloo the pursuit of his army and himself his abdication and banishment to the island of saint helena concluded the napoleonic wars
from 1803-06 the third coalition fought the first french empire and its client states see table at right although several naval battles determined control of the seas the outcome of the war was decided on the continent predominantly in two major land operations in the danube valley the ulm campaign in the upper danube and the vienna campaign in the middle danube valley
political conflicts in vienna delayed austria's entry into the third coalition until 1805 after hostilities of the war of the second coalition ended in 1801 archduke charles--the emperor's brother--took advantage of the subsequent years of peace to develop a military restructuring plan he carefully put this plan into effect beginning in 1803–04 but implementation was incomplete in 1805 when karl mack lieutenant field marshal and quartermaster-general of the army implemented his own restructuring mack bypassed charles'methodical approach occurring in the field mack's plan also undermined the overall command and organizational structure regardless mack sent an enthusiastic report to vienna on the military's readiness furthermore after misreading napoleon's maneuvers in württemberg mack also reported to vienna on the weakness of french dispositions his reports convinced the war party advising the emperor francis ii to enter the conflict against france despite charles'own advice to the contrary responding to the report and rampant anti-french fever in vienna francis dismissed charles from his post as generalissimo and appointed his francophobic brother-in-law archduke ferdinand as commander
the inexperienced ferdinand was a poor choice of replacement for the capable charles having neither maturity nor aptitude for the assignment although ferdinand retained nominal command day-to-day decisions were placed in the hands of mack equally ill-suited for such an important assignment when mack was wounded early in the campaign he was unable to take full charge of the army consequently command further devolved to lieutenant field marshal karl philipp prince of schwarzenberg an able cavalry officer but inexperienced in the command of such a large army
the campaign in the upper danube valley began in october with several clashes in swabia near the bavarian town of wertingen 40 kilometers 25 mi northwest of augsburg on 8 october the 1st regiment of dragoons part of murat's reserve cavalry corps and grenadiers of lannes'v corps surprised an austrian force half its size the austrians were arrayed in a line and unable to form their defensive squares quickly enough to protect themselves from the 4,000 dragoons and 8,000 grenadiers nearly 3,000 austrians were captured and over 400 were killed or wounded a day later at another small town günzburg--immediately south of the danube river--the french 59th regiment of the line stormed a bridge over the danube and humiliatingly chased two large austrian columns toward ulm
the campaign was not entirely bad news for vienna at haslach johann von klenau arranged his 25,000 infantry and cavalry in a prime defensive position and on 11 october the overly confident general of division pierre dupont de l 'étang attacked klenau's force with fewer than 8,000 men the french lost 1,500 men killed and wounded aside from taking the imperial eagles and guidons of the 15th and 17th dragoons klenau's force also captured 900 men 11 guns and 18 ammunition wagons
klenau's victory was a singular success on 14 october mack sent two columns out of ulm in preparation for a breakout to the north one under johann sigismund riesch headed toward elchingen to secure the bridge there and the other under franz von werneck went north with most of the heavy artillery recognizing the opportunity marshal michel ney hurried the rest of his vi corps forward to re-establish contact with dupont who was still north of the danube in a two-pronged attack ney sent one division to the south of elchingen on the right bank of the danube this division began the assault at elchingen at the same time another division crossed the river to the east and moved west against riesch's position after clearing austrian pickets from a bridge the french attacked and captured a strategically located abbey at the top of the hill at bayonet point the austrian cavalry unsuccessfully tried to fend off the french but the austrian infantry broke and ran in this engagement alone the austrians lost more than half their reserve artillery park 6,000 out of 8,000 total participants dead wounded or captured and four colors reisch's column also failed to destroy the bridges across the danube
napoleon's lightning campaign exposed the austrian indecisive command structure and poor supply apparatus mack completely misread the french dispositions and scattered his forces as the french defeated each unit separately the surviving austrians withdrew toward the ulm fortifications napoleon arrived to take personal command of close to 80,000 men at ulm on 16 october karl mack surrendered his encircled army of 20,000 infantry and 3,273 cavalry the officers were released on the condition that they not serve against france until formally exchanged for french officers captured by the austrians an agreement to which they held
the few austrian corps not trapped at ulm withdrew toward vienna with the french in close pursuit a russian army under gen. mikhail kutuzov also maneuvered away from the french withdrawing to the east at the ill river on 22 october it joined with the retreating austrian corps commanded by michael von kienmayer on 5 november the coalition forces held a successful rearguard action in amstetten on 7 november the russians arrived in st. pölten and crossed the danube river the next day late on 9 november they destroyed the bridges across the danube holding the last one at the hamlet of stein near the village krems until the late afternoon
to the east of stein 2 kilometers 1.2 mi down an old road lay krems with its small population of a few hundred at the confluence of the stream of that name and the danube to the west of stein the danube made a large curve creating a crescent-shaped floodplain between it and the mountains at the far western end of the floodplain where the mountains came down almost to the river's edge was dürenstein with its castle known as schloss dürenstein the castle had served as a prison for richard i of england in 1193 in 1645–46 during the thirty years war the swedes had fortified the castle and then demolished it when they withdrew it stands at 159 meters 522 ft on the highest ridge of a mountain fissured with clefts and pinnacles of granite because the mountain was sparsely vegetated it was difficult to distinguish the ruins from the rocks narrow canyons cut through the mountain and widen into the plain below between dürenstein and stein on the flood plain lay the hamlets of oberloiben and unterloiben near the hamlets the loiben flood plain was at its widest extending at the most 762 meters 2,500 ft from the base of the loibenberg mountain to the bank of the river
the region was known for its wine since the 15th century the local inhabitants practiced viticulture and the wine producers formed st. paul vintners'guild in 1447 the oldest such guild in the german-speaking world terraced vineyards extended up the sides of the krems river until it became a mountain stream and terrain was unsuitable for cultivation the loiben plain supported both viticulture and agriculture as the terrain became steeper the vines grew in terraces built from the dark urgestein primordial rock from dürenstein to krems the river makes its wide curve the mountains and the steeply terraced slopes prevent clear line-of-sight between the two towns
napoleon had calculated that kutuzov would withdraw toward vienna expecting reinforcements from russia he envisioned that the armies would engage in a great battle at vienna and that this battle would decide the war consequently napoleon drew divisions from four of the other seven corps of the grande armée to create a new viii corps this corps was to secure the north shore of the danube block any of the austrian or russian groups from reinforcing one another and more importantly prevent kutuzov from crossing the river and escaping to russia
the new viii corps under the overall command of édouard mortier included three infantry divisions and a division of cavalry see order of battle below corps mortier as it was known crossed the danube at linz and passau in early november 1805 and marched east on the north bank of the danube operating independently the corp's cavalry conducted reconnaissance ahead of them and on the flanks gen. gazan's division about 6,000 men took the lead mortier was with them they were followed by gen. dupont's division another 4,000 about one day's march behind jean-baptiste dumonceau's division another 4,000 marching another day behind dupont brought up the rear a flotilla of 50 boats acquired at passau provided communications across the danube before sending mortier on his mission napoleon instructed him to protect his north flank at all times against possible russian reinforcements advice he reiterated in subsequent written orders napoleon also advised mortier to secure all crossings of the danube between linz and vienna
on 9 november gazan's division reached marbach an der donau and covered the 50 kilometers 31 mi to dürenstein by early on the following afternoon here it skirmished with some russian patrols to the east of the town and expelled them feeling confident the french established a forward post just upstream from stein in dürenstein itself mortier set up his command post and directed the establishment of a small field hospital although the position seemed secure he had ignored napoleon's strict instructions and neglected to protect his left north flank
this failure was an important factor when mortier lost his corps'so-called eyes after he and gazan had crossed the danube the french dragoons had veered to the northwest leaving only three squadrons of the 4th dragoons available for reconnaissance these had left the division and were operating independently of gazan's command consequently mortier and gazan marched blindly through the narrow canyon west of dürenstein not knowing what lay ahead of them kutuzov had led the coalition army across the danube at krems a short distance past stein and destroyed the bridge behind him his actions deprived the french commanders of a possible route across the danube putting the deployment of the entire french division at further risk in the case of retreat in this decision kutuzov abandoned vienna to the french who were converging on the austrian capital from the north west and southwest for the security of uniting with reinforcements from galicia kutuzov chose a military solution over a political one
unknown to either gazan or mortier the coalition had concentrated a force of approximately 24,000 men mostly russians and a few austrians within a few kilometers of the french position at dürenstein in comparison gazan's division had only 6,000 men the austro-russian force was a mixture of infantry jägers usually deployed as skirmishers russian musketeers and russian and austrian cavalry accompanied by more than 68 artillery pieces kutuzov who had learned the military arts under the tutelage of the legendary russian generalissimo suvorov had overall command the russian cavalry units of the greatly feared cossacks were well-suited for patrolling the river bank indeed on 9 november they had taken 40 french soldiers as prisoners furthermore reinforcements stood in moravia less than two weeks'march away if the main body of the french army crossed the river they would require time to prepare kutuzov would have ample warning of any large-scale french movement
after the afternoon's initial skirmishing with the french kutuzov held a council of war on the evening of 10 november at melk at the great abbey there he knew several things first he knew the positions of the french from prisoners his cossacks had captured he also knew that gazan had crossed at linz and was well ahead of any french reinforcements dupont had crossed at passau and by 10 november stood at marbach 50 kilometers 31 mi upstream and dumonceau was another 7 kilometers 4 mi further behind him kutuzov knew the size of the french force--its division strength--and its positions and he knew that most of the dragoons were not covering the french flank but had turned north he also knew or had made a good supposition about napoleon's orders so he knew what to offer mortier and gazan as bait
in addition to the russian generals the council included austrian commanders lieutenant field marshal johann heinrich von schmitt and friedrich karl wilhelm fürst zu hohenlohe schmitt who had retired from the military in 1800 had been recalled into service after the ulm debacle and had come to kutuzov highly recommended by the emperor he was an experienced tactician and strategist and had served in a variety of posts in the habsburg military he had been archduke charles'trusted adviser during the campaigns from 1796 to 1800 and had assisted in planning several of charles'victories upon his recall schmitt was appointed chief of the quartermaster general staff of the coalition army the generals had found among the austrian force one capt. christoph freiherr von stiebar 1753–1824 who had knowledge of the local geography
together schmitt kutuzov and the other generals with von stiebar's advice on the local terrain concocted a plan to encircle the french at dürenstein russian commander mikhail andreyevich miloradovich would approach gazan's division from the east supported by petr bagration's corps and pin the french in place three additional columns commanded by dmitry dokhturov doctorov maj. gen. strik and schmitt would outflank the french from the west and the north they would offer as bait a rumor the russian army was retreating into moravia and only a rearguard would be left at krems
on the night of 10–11 november a russian column under strik's command began its passage through the narrow canyons intent on arriving at dürenstein by noon two more columns under dokhtorov and schmitt moved in wider semicircles planning to pass through the mountains and attack the french who were extended along the river bank according to the plan in late morning strik's column would emerge from the mountains first and launch a flanking assault on the french right this flanking attack combined with miloradovich's frontal assault from stein would force the french into a vise encircled they would have no option but to surrender--or die to ensure the success of the plan the second and third columns under dokhtorov and schmitt would arrive in early and mid-afternoon and support the earlier assaults in this way even if the french tried to retreat west to marbach they would not escape the vise-like grip of the coalition army
mortier accepted the bait of a rumored russian retreat in the early morning of 11 november he and gazan departed from dürenstein to seize stein and krems presuming the russians had either abandoned the settlements or left only a small rear-guard behind as they approached stein a column of miloradovich's troops attacked the french forward positions thinking this force was the rumored russian rear guard mortier ordered gen. gazan to counterattack and push east towards the town of stein fighting spread though the villages of oberloiben unterloiben and the farm at rothenhof instead of withdrawing as a rear guard would more and more russian troops appeared and engaged the french column
initially gazan made rapid progress but he quickly recognized that the opposing force was much stronger than the typical rear guard of a retreating army realizing he had been duped and that gazan's troops were tiring rapidly mortier sent orders to dupont's division to hurry forward by mid-morning the french momentum had stalled mortier committed most of his remaining forces to driving miloradovich back leaving a single battalion--perhaps 300 troops--to cover his northern flank and sent the rest to attack the russian right within 30 minutes he achieved the superiority of numbers he sought his 4,500 french opposed 2,600 russians and forced them back toward stein while pressing an attack along the river miloradovich had no option for neither strik's nor dokhtorov's flanking columns were to be seen
at this stage of the battle fighting paused mortier and gazan waited for dupont's arrival while kutuzov and miloradovich waited for strik's and dokhturov's schmitt's column was expected to be the last to join the fight because it had to march the greatest distance the timing of the respite varies depending on whose reports are consulted fighting paused at around 12 00 or 14 00 strik arrived first and immediately assaulted gazan's line with three battalions pushing the french out of dürenstein caught between two strong forces gazan attempted to push his way back through dürenstein to reach the river where the flotilla could evacuate his exhausted troops withdrawing through the narrow danube canyon and fighting off the russian force at their rear gazan and his division were trapped when more of strik's russians appeared to block their retreat the narrow defiles hampered the russians strik's men had to march out of the canyons form ranks and attack in waves despite strik's continuous assault in the next two to three hours mortier and gazan pushed the russians back up the narrow fissure in the hillside at this point dokhturov's column appeared behind the french line and joined the battle the french were outnumbered more than three to one assaulted in the front by miloradovich's column in the middle by strik's and in the rear by dokhturov
earlier in the morning dupont had proceeded with his column south and east along the river from marbach according to instructions even before the arrival of mortier's courier he heard the sound of artillery in the distance and sent riders ahead to discover the cause they came back to report that a russian column dokhturov's was descending from the mountains to take the road to dürenstein realizing this would separate him from the forward division dupont hustled his troops toward the sound of battle and deployed them to take the russians in the flank the french assault heralded by cannon fire caused dokhturov's troops to turn their attention from gazan's beleaguered force to face these new assailants although superior in numbers dokhturov's column had no supporting artillery and the narrow space prevented them from taking advantage of their size it was dokhturov's turn to face attackers at his front and rear until the arrival of schmitt's column which had wended its way through the mountains in the west
schmitt arrived at dusk and the action continued well after dark in mid-november night falls at close to 17 00 in the upper danube climes despite the darkness schmitt descended out of the defiles and deployed his troops to assail dupont's flank as his russians entered the fray they came between a battalion of french and another of russians with the additional force the french were overwhelmed but most of the shooting subsided when the combatants could not tell apart friend from foe in the dark under the cover of darkness mortier used the french flotilla to evacuate his exhausted troops to the south bank the french and russians continued to skirmish fitfully into the night as sentries encountered one another in the dark portions of gazan's force provided any necessary rear guard action and the following morning the remaining men were evacuated from the north shore of the danube while they maintained possession of only spitz and weissenkirchen on the north bank
the losses were staggering gazan lost close to 40 percent of his division to death and wounds aside from losing five guns 47 officers and 895 men under his command were captured bringing the loss of effectives closer to 60 percent furthermore he lost the eagles of the 4th infantry regiment france and the eagle and guidon of the 4th dragoons the russians lost around 4,000 about 16 percent of their force and two regimental colors the austrian lieutenant field marshal schmitt was killed as the battle concluded probably by russian musketry in the confused melee the vineyards and the villages of ober- and unterloiben were destroyed as was most of dürenstein and stein krems was heavily damaged the french plundered the town at least twice and barbarously handled its inhabitants
both sides claimed victory although losses were fairly equal in terms of numbers--4,000 wounded or dead on each side--the coalition forces went into battle with 24,000 men while the french started with gazan's division of about 6,000 which grew close to 8,000 when dupont's men joined the fighting in the afternoon regardless gazan's division was nearly destroyed the 30 percent losses experienced by the french fell predominantly on his division clearly for both sides the fighting was hard the weather had been cold an early storm had left slick icy mud in the roadways and icicles like chandeliers hung from the trees
for the coalition the russians were secure on the north bank of the danube awaiting reinforcements from galicia the bridges between linz and vienna had been destroyed making french access to the austrian capital more difficult but not impossible after six months of fighting in which the austrians had enjoyed little good news the coalition could claim a difficult and timely victory the french had retreated from the field with a badly mauled division and kutuzov had secured the right flank indeed francis was so pleased with the outcome at dürenstein that he awarded kutuzov the military order of maria theresa
for the french the survival of the corps mortier seemed nothing short of a miracle the remainder of gazan's division crossed the river the next morning and eventually recuperated in vienna which the french acquired by deception later in the month more importantly for them the french force had performed well over difficult terrain and under terrible combat conditions initially there had been some panic and parts of at least one french battalion had tried to escape on the flotilla craft they had lost control of the boats in the current and smashed into the pillars of the burned bridge at krems overturning their boats tossed into the icy river most had drowned despite this initial panic gazan's column retained its cohesion and responded well to various difficult demands dupont had demonstrated his tactical acumen when he heard cannon fire he directed his troops toward it to support the french division in terms of french staffing mortier's failure to guard his flank especially in the face of napoleon's direct advice adversely influenced his relationship with his commander however in the immediate weeks ahead the flamboyant murat did more to annoy napoleon than mortier had in assessing the battle and its aftermath historians have laid the blame and credit for its outcome not only on mortier and gazan napoleon aware of mortier's danger and his own culpability for it vented his frustration on murat whom he unjustly accused of abandoning mortier for the empty glory of riding through vienna
after the victory at austerlitz napoleon dispersed the viii corps and reassigned mortier however disappointed he may have been with mortier napoleon was pleased with gazan's performance as recognition of his conduct in what the french called the immortal battle of dürenstein gazan received the officer's grand cross of the legion of honor
the loss of schmitt was a significant blow to the austrian military organization called out of retirement for this specific task he was one of their most experienced general staff officers other than the archduke charles from the summer of 1796 until his retirement in 1800 he had been chief of the quartermaster general staff of the army the lower rhine the rhine and the army of germany furthermore he was a trusted member of archduke charles'staff he had helped to design several of charles'more important victories at emmendingen schliengen the sieges at kehl and hünigen the battles at ostrach and stockach and the northern swiss campaign of 1799 that included battles at winterthur and zürich an experienced officer and excellent tactician he might well have made a more effective chief of the quartermaster general staff of the coalition army at the battle of austerlitz than his eventual replacement franz von weyrother in schmitt's absence weyrother the architect of the austrian catastrophe at hohenlinden in 1800 was chosen to develop the general battle plan of coalition action at austerlitz schmitt undoubtedly a far better tactician than weyrother and possessed of superior training and mapping skills would have developed a more realistic coalition plan for austerlitz schmitt's presence would probably not have been enough to turn that defeat into a victory but it would have mitigated the magnitude of the coalition's losses austerlitz was considered one of napoleon's finest triumphs
in the broader picture despite the important major naval engagements the outcome of the war of the third coalition was determined on the continent predominantly in the two major land operations in the ulm campaign the habsburgs achieved some minor victories such as klenau's at haslach-jungingen but ultimately lost an entire army and an officer corps the latter would not resume arms against france until formally exchanged this condition crippled the austrian military leadership and forced the recall of such pensioners as schmitt out of retirement after the capitulation at ulm isolated portions of the austrian military evaded capture and joined with their russian allies michael von kienmayer's corps slipped out of the encirclement and joined kutuzov's force a few other small forces refused to capitulate and seemingly melted into the bavarian mountains and the thurgingian forests to reappear in bohemia for austerlitz sixteen hundred cavalry including archduke ferdinand and prince schwarzenberg broke out of ulm before its capitulation maximilian count of merveldt led his column back through the mountains into austria fighting rear guard actions against pursuing french forces at the steyer steyr and mariazell these elusive units were insufficient to balance heavy losses at key battles in which the austrians could not hold their own against the french between the ulm capitulation and the austrian and russian defeat at austerlitz there were other minor achievements a successful skirmish between the cavalry that escaped from ulm and the french near the town of nördlingen the contested victory at dürenstein and another within days at schöngrabern
the second determining event the decisive french victory at the battle of austerlitz over the combined russian and austrian armies forced the austrian withdrawal from the coalition the subsequent peace of pressburg signed on 26 december 1805 reinforced the earlier treaties of campo formio and lunéville furthermore austria ceded land to napoleon's german allies and paid an indemnity of 40 million francs victory at austerlitz also gave napoleon the latitude to create a buffer zone of german states between france and the states of prussia russia and austria these measures did not establish a lasting peace on the continent prussian worries about growing french influence in central europe sparked the war of the fourth coalition in 1806 in which austria did not participate
until 1805 dürenstein was probably best known as the village in which crusader richard the lionheart was held by leopold v duke of austria in 1741 during the war of the austrian succession several hundred local villagers had held off the french and bavarian armies intent on capturing vienna by painting drain pipes to look like cannons and beating on drums thus suggesting the presence of a large force
after 1805 the exploits of 40,000 french russian and austrian soldiers excited the european imagination general schmitt's grave has never been found but in 1811 a monument for him was erected at the stein tor the gate leading from the old village of krems to the hamlet of stein the house in which captain von stiebar lived was marked with a bronze plate commemorating his contribution to the battle in 1840 a spanish lithographer created an image of the battle which was later expanded by english lithographer john outhwaite the image depicts the evacuation of french troops via the danube flotilla see infobox image on a moonlit night in fact the moon was in its last quarter phase 48 hours later and on 11 november probably did not provide as much light as depicted in the image
in 1836 jean antoine siméon fort french 1793–1861 a historical painter created a watercolor of the battle combat de dürnstein le 11 novembre 1805 english battle of dürenstein of 11 november 1805 which is in the trianon collection at versailles
in the russian novel war and peace leo tolstoy devoted several pages to the battle its prelude and its aftermath and the delivery of its news to the tsar by prince andrew between dürenstein and rossatz at the edge of the loiben plain stands the little frenchman memorial see image erected in 1905 to commemorate the battle it bears the names of mortier gazan kutuzov schmitt and others on a copper-engraved plate

after wrestlemania lesnar turned his attention to john cena who had returned from injury in february 2003 and who had been f-5'd into a ringpost in the same manner angle had been cena claimed lesnar nearly ended his career and even named his new finishing move the f.u. as a jab at the new champion the feud ended in a match at backlash when lesnar defeated cena on the following episode of smackdown lesnar returned to his rivalry with big show after he injured rey mysterio badly during their match at backlash show's attack resulted in mysterio being carried out on a stretcher and back board and big show took mysterio off the stretcher and swung the back board into the ringpost compounding the injury lesnar called out the big show who demanded that lesnar put his title on the line against him this led to a stretcher match at judgment day for the title lesnar successfully retained his title with help from rey mysterio and a forklift during the scripted rivalry on smackdown lesnar lifted big show off the top-rope in a superplex which caused the ring to collapse on impact

lesnar continued to aggressively pursue the wwe title despite his friendship with angle mr. mcmahon found his way into the angle at first berating lesnar who had involved himself in mcmahon's rivalry with zach gowen for losing to angle this all turned out to be a swerve that came into focus on the august 7 2003 smackdown in kelowna british columbia that night lesnar and mcmahon were to face each other in a steel cage match with angle as the special guest referee as per mcmahon's orders on the previous week's program during the match lesnar had passed out due to a staged backstage incident and mcmahon was set to pin him but angle refused to allow mcmahon to win that way as the two men began to argue lesnar rose to his feet revealing the ruse to the crowd and f-5'd angle he then brutally beat angle while mcmahon watched and celebrated with him afterwards turning heel in the process at summerslam lesnar lost to angle when angle made lesnar tap out to the ankle lock after that lesnar would cement his heel turn by brutalizing smaller wrestlers and attacking his rivals on a more consistent basis he returned to using the f-5 to propel his opponents'legs into the ringpost as he did to spanky and gowen and interfered in angle's matches on two separate occasions on the september 18 2003 episode of smackdown lesnar received his third shot at angle in as many months when he faced the champion in a sixty-minute iron man match for the title lesnar won the match and his third wwe championship by a final count of five to four

lesnar returned on the january 28 2013 episode of raw confronting vince mcmahon who was about to fire heyman and despite heyman's pleas lesnar hit mcmahon with an f-5 breaking mcmahon's pelvis in storyline the following week during the miz's miztv talk show raw managing supervisor vickie guerrero revealed herself as the one who signed lesnar to a new contract to impress mcmahon on the february 25 episode of raw lesnar once again attempted to attack mcmahon only to get into a brawl with the returning triple h which resulted in lesnar legitimately having his head split open and requiring eighteen stitches the following week triple h issued a challenge to lesnar requesting a rematch with him at wrestlemania 29 which lesnar accepted but only after triple signed a contract and lesnar named the stipulation the following week after triple h signed the contract and assaulted heyman the stipulation was revealed as no holds barred with triple h's career on the line lesnar ended up losing the match after triple h hit him with a pedigree onto the steel steps on the april 15 episode of raw lesnar attacked 3mb heath slater drew mcintyre and jinder mahal before heyman challenged triple h to face lesnar in a steel cage match at extreme rules which triple h accepted the following week on may 19 at the pay-per-view after interference from heyman he defeated triple h and ended their feud lesnar returned on the june 17 episode of raw attacking heyman's fellow client cm punk with an f-5 despite the accusations from punk heyman claimed that he was not behind lesnar's attack on him however in july heyman turned on punk and claimed that punk could not beat lesnar which led to lesnar making his return and attacking punk on the july 15 episode of raw the following week on raw punk challenged lesnar to a match at summerslam where lesnar defeated punk in a no disqualification match
on the december 30 episode of raw lesnar returned with heyman to announce his intentions to challenge the winner of the upcoming wwe world heavyweight championship match between randy orton and john cena at the royal rumble lesnar then dared any wrestler who disapproved of that notion to challenge him which was answered by mark henry and a brawl would ensue ending with lesnar delivering an f-5 to henry the following week on raw henry challenged lesnar again only to have lesnar dislocate his elbow with the kimura lock in storyline and this led big show to came out afterwards to confront lesnar thus starting a feud which was settled at royal rumble where lesnar defeated the big show after attacking him with a steel chair before the match began on the february 24 2014 episode of raw after heyman stated that lesnar had requested a match for the wwe world heavyweight championship at wrestlemania xxx instead receiving an open contract to face anyone else of his choosing the undertaker then returned and chokeslammed lesnar through a table setting up their match at wrestlemania lesnar defeated undertaker after executing three f-5s ending his undefeated wrestlemania streak at 21 a feat that was described by sports illustrated as being the most shocking result since the montreal screwjob
on the july 21 2014 episode of raw triple h announced that lesnar would face john cena at summerslam for the wwe world heavyweight championship at summerslam lesnar defeated cena to become the wwe world heavyweight champion and during the match he delivered sixteen suplexes most of which were german suplexes and two f-5s to cena who barely managed any offense on the august 19 episode of main event triple h announced that cena was invoking his championship rematch clause against lesnar at night of champions where lesnar was disqualified due to seth rollins interfering but retained his championship which could not be lost via disqualification later in the year after rollins reunited with the authority he was added to lesnar and cena's championship match at royal rumble making it a triple threat match which lesnar won despite suffering a storyline broken rib during the match
lesnar's next challenger was roman reigns who won the royal rumble match to earn the right to face lesnar for the title at wrestlemania 31 during his main-event match against reigns lesnar delivered multiple suplexes and was heard exclaiming suplex city bitch and thereafter suplex city became one of his signature catchphrases and merchandise motifs after lesnar and reigns traded a few false finishes rollins cashed in his money in the bank contract while the match was in progress making it a triple threat rollins then pinned reigns to win the title the following night on raw lesnar tried to invoke his rematch clause and subsequently attacked commentators booker t john bradshaw layfield and michael cole as well as a cameraman after rollins refused the rematch which led to stephanie mcmahon suspending lesnar indefinitely in storyline
lesnar returned on the june 15 episode of raw as a fan favorite being chosen by the authority as the number one contender to rollins'wwe world heavyweight championship at battleground on july 4 lesnar made his first non-televised wrestling appearance for wwe since his 2012 return defeating kofi kingston at the beast in the east live event in tokyo in a quick winning effort he also delivered f-5s to kingston's new day stablemates big e and xavier woods after the match on july 19 at battleground lesnar dominated rollins delivering 13 suplexes mid-pinfall after performing an f-5 he was attacked by the undertaker who incapacitated lesnar with a chokeslam and two tombstone piledrivers this ended the match with lesnar winning by disqualification and rollins retaining the championship
the following night on raw undertaker explained that he had attacked lesnar not for ending his wrestlemania streak but rather for lesnar allowing heyman to constantly taunt undertaker about it this led to the two brawling throughout the arena and a wrestlemania rematch being scheduled for summerslam on august 23 where undertaker would controversially defeat lesnar during the match undertaker tapped out to a kimura lock by lesnar and the timekeeper rang the bell but the referee did not see the tapout and demanded that the match continue which saw undertaker then hitting lesnar with a low blow and lesnar passed out to undertaker's submission hold hell's gate the following night on raw lesnar and heyman challenged undertaker to an immediate rematch only to be confronted by bo dallas who mocked lesnar about his defeat lesnar then responded by delivering 3 german suplexes and an f-5 to dallas
during night of champions it was announced that lesnar would face the undertaker at the hell in a cell pay-per-view where lesnar defeated the undertaker after a low blow and f-5 onto the exposed ring floor ending their feud the match was later voted match of the year during the 2015 slammy awards on the january 11 episode of raw lesnar returned attacking the new day the league of nations sheamus king barrett rusev and alberto del rio and kevin owens before giving an f-5 to roman reigns the following week on raw lesnar would brawl with reigns until they were both attacked by the wyatt family at the royal rumble lesnar was the 23rd entrant eliminating four competitors before being eliminated by bray wyatt with help from the rest of the wyatt family
on the january 25 episode of raw stephanie mcmahon announced that the main event of fastlane would be a triple threat match between lesnar roman reigns and dean ambrose to determine who would face triple h for the wwe world heavyweight championship at wrestlemania 32 in the following weeks lesnar would be continuously provoked by ambrose with reigns saving him from the subsequent attacks by lesnar at fastlane lesnar dominated most of the match before he was put through two announce tables by ambrose and reigns he would ultimately lose the match after reigns pinned ambrose because of this lesnar attacked ambrose in the parking lot as he was arriving at the arena for raw but ambrose would return later in the night having hijacked an ambulance and he challenged lesnar to a no holds barred street fight match at wrestlemania 32 where lesnar defeated ambrose on the july 7 edition of smackdown it was announced that lesnar would be facing the returning randy orton at summerslam on july 19 at the 2016 wwe draft lesnar was drafted to raw
after his match at wrestlemania xx lesnar sidelined his career in wwe to pursue a career in the national football league nfl despite not playing american football since high school the wwe issued this statement on their official website wwe.com following his departure
brock lesnar has made a personal decision to put his wwe career on hold to prepare to tryout for the national football league this season brock has wrestled his entire professional career in the wwe and we are proud of his accomplishments and wish him the best in his new endeavor
lesnar later told a minnesota radio show that he had three wonderful years in wwe but had grown unhappy and always wanted to play pro football adding that he did not want to be 40 years old and wondering if he could have made it in football in an interview about the nfl he stated
this is no load of bull it's no wwe stunt i am dead serious about this i ain 't afraid of anything and i ain 't afraid of anybody i 've been an underdog in athletics since i was five i got zero college offers for wrestling now people say i can 't play football that it's a joke i say i can i 'm as good an athlete as a lot of guys in the nfl if not better i 've always had to fight for everything i wasn 't the best technician in amateur wrestling but i was strong had great conditioning and a hard head nobody could break me as long as i have that i don 't give a damn what anybody else thinks
lesnar had a great showing at the nfl combine on april 17 2004 a minivan collided with his motorbike he suffered a broken jaw and left hand a bruised pelvis and a pulled groin several nfl teams expressed interest in watching lesnar work out the minnesota vikings worked out lesnar on june 11 2004 but he was hampered by the groin injury suffered in the april motorcycle accident on july 24 it was reported that he was nearly recovered from his groin injury he signed with the vikings on july 27 and played in several preseason games for the team he was released by the vikings on august 30 2004 lesnar received an invitation to play as a representative for the vikings in nfl europa but declined due to his desire to stay in the united states with his family he had several football cards produced of him during his time with the vikings
on april 29 2006 after the final match of the k-1 world grand prix 2006 in las vegas lesnar announced his intent to join k-1's mixed martial arts league hero's he trained with minnesota martial arts academy under greg nelson and minnesota assistant head wrestling coach marty morgan lesnar announced on august 12 in las vegas that he had signed a deal with the k-1 promotion his first fight was scheduled against choi hong-man of korea on june 2 2007 at the k-1 dynamite usa show however prior to the match hong-man was replaced by min soo kim lesnar submitted soo kim with strikes in 1 09 of the first round to win his first official mma match
during ufc 77 it was announced that lesnar had reached a deal to fight with the ultimate fighting championship ufc on february 2 2008 lesnar made his debut with the promotion in an event titled ufc 81 breaking point against former ufc heavyweight champion frank mir due to his large hands lesnar was wearing 4xl gloves for the fight making him the second man in nevada's combat sports history to wear such gloves after choi hong-man lesnar secured an early takedown and began landing numerous punches but was docked a point after a punch hit mir on the back of the head following another takedown by lesnar mir managed to secure a kneebar and force a submission at 1 30 of the first round and lesnar lost in his ufc debut at ufc 82 former ufc heavyweight champion and hall of famer mark coleman was announced to fight lesnar at ufc 87 however coleman withdrew from the fight due to an injury and was replaced by heath herring lesnar defeated herring by unanimous decision
lesnar would then face randy couture for the ufc heavyweight championship at ufc 91 on november 15 lesnar would beat couture via a technical knockout tko in the second round to become the new ufc heavyweight champion
on december 27 2008 at ufc 92 frank mir defeated antônio nogueira for the interim heavyweight championship and was to face lesnar for the undisputed ufc heavyweight championship at ufc 98 immediately after winning the interim heavyweight title mir found lesnar in the crowd and shouted you 've got my belt due to a knee injury to mir the title unification match with lesnar that was originally slated to be the ufc 98 main event was postponed lesnar won the postponed rematch with mir at ufc 100 on july 11 2009 via technical knockout in the second round the win earned lesnar beatdown of the year honors with anderson silva from sherdog for 2009 during his post-match celebration lesnar flipped off the crowd who had been booing him lesnar also made a disparaging comment about the pay-per-view's primary sponsor bud light claiming they won 't pay me nothin'" and promoted coors light instead lesnar later apologized for his remarks at the post-fight press conference where he held a bottle of bud light and endorsed their product
on july 1 2009 it was reported that the winner of the shane carwin vs. cain velasquez fight at ufc 104 would face lesnar but the match was scrapped and lesnar was scheduled to defend his belt against shane carwin at ufc 106 on november 21 on october 26 2009 it was announced that lesnar pulled out of his carwin bout due to an illness ufc president dana white said lesnar had been ill for three weeks claiming he had never been this sick in his life and that it would take him a while to recover his fight with carwin was rescheduled for ufc 108 on january 2 2010 lesnar initially sought treatment in canada but later told reporters that he had received third world treatment at a hospital in brandon manitoba and that seeking better treatment in the u.s. saved his life lesnar went on to criticize canadian health care further and stated that he shared his experience in an effort to speak on the behalf of the doctors in the united states that don 't want health care reform to happen
on november 4 it was confirmed that lesnar was suffering from mononucleosis and that his bout with carwin would have to wait a bit longer and the fight for lesnar's heavyweight championship was cancelled on november 14 at the ufc 105 post-fight conference dana white stated lesnar ]'s not well and he's not going to be getting well anytime soon and that an interim title match might need to be set up in addition to mononucleosis it was revealed that he was suffering from a serious case of diverticulitis an intestinal disorder which required surgery after further diagnosis lesnar underwent surgery on november 16 to close a perforation in his intestine that had been leaking fecal matter into his abdomen causing pain abscesses and overtaxing his immune system to the point that he contracted mononucleosis from the level of damage to lesnar's system the surgeon estimated that the intestinal condition had been ongoing for around a year
in january 2010 lesnar announced on espn's sportscenter that he was scheduled to make a return to the ufc in the summer a match between frank mir and shane carwin took place on march 27 at ufc 111 to determine the interim heavyweight champion and lesnar's next opponent shane carwin defeated mir via knockout in the first round becoming the new interim champion after the fight lesnar came into the ring and stated it was a good fight but he's wearing a belt that's a make-believe belt i 've got the real championship belt lesnar faced carwin at ufc 116 to unify the heavyweight titles early in the first round carwin knocked lesnar down with punch gave him a cut above his left eye and used a ground and pound attack the rest of the round in the next round lesnar was able to take carwin down attain a full mount then move into side-control and finish the fight with an arm triangle choke with the victory lesnar became the undisputed ufc heavyweight champion earning his first submission of the night and giving carwin his first loss the win also tied a ufc record for most consecutive successful heavyweight championship defenses
lesnar's next defense was against undefeated top contender cain velasquez on october 23 at the honda center in anaheim california at ufc 121 dana white announced via sportsnation that the ufc would bring back ufc primetime to hype the fight he was defeated by velasquez for the title by tko in the first round
on january 11 2011 lesnar was announced as a coach of the ultimate fighter season 13 opposite junior dos santos with the two expected to fight on june 11 at ufc 131 however he was struck with another bout of diverticulitis and had to withdraw from the fight on may 12 he was replaced by shane carwin who ended up losing against dos santos lesnar underwent surgery on may 27 to help battle his problems with diverticulitis dana white said that he had a 12-inch piece of his colon removed
in its may 2011 issue espn's magazine published a story listing the highest paid athlete based on base salary and earnings for the most recent calendar year or most recent season in 30 sports lesnar topped the list for mma at 5.3 million which included his reported bout salaries and estimated pay-per-view bonuses
in the summer of 2011 lesnar announced that he was returning to action stating i feel like a new man healthy strong i feel like i used to feel his return match was scheduled to be at ufc 141 on december 30 in las vegas against former strikeforce heavyweight champion alistair overeem overeem won the fight by way of technical knockout in the first round the result of the fight remains controversial as overeem tested positive for elevated levels of testosterone prior to his next fight lesnar then announced his retirement from mma mentioning his struggles with diverticulitis and saying tonight was the last time you 'll see me in the octagon
speculation about a return to mma lasted until march 24 2015 when lesnar announced in an interview on sportscenter that he had re-signed with wwe and officially closed the door on a return to mma even though he was offered a deal ten times more than what he had made previously in his mma career he further elaborated that while he was training for months for a return to the ufc he felt physically great but something was lacking mentally lesnar added that he's an older caveman now so he makes smarter caveman decisions and that he chose to sign with wwe instead of returning to mma because he could work part-time with full-time pay
though lesnar said he was closing the door on mma in march 2015 ufc announced on june 4 2016 that he would return at ufc 200 on july 9 wwe confirmed it had granted lesnar a one-off opportunity to compete at ufc 200 before he would return to the company for summerslam on august 21
lesnar representing canada for the first time in his career defeated mark hunt by unanimous decision 29-27 avoiding 19 of hunt's 30 attempted standing strikes and taking him down four times to land 43 significant ground strikes 32 in the final round he also won a ufc-record 2.5 million purse

1 lesnar's iwgp heavyweight championship reign at igf is considered a continuation of his reign from njpw
2 when lesnar won the title for the first time it was known as the wwe undisputed championship his next two reigns were as simply wwe champion while his final one was as wwe world heavyweight champion
constant k filters also k-type filters are a type of electronic filter designed using the image method they are the original and simplest filters produced by this methodology and consist of a ladder network of identical sections of passive components historically they are the first filters that could approach the ideal filter frequency response to within any prescribed limit with the addition of a sufficient number of sections however they are rarely considered for a modern design the principles behind them having been superseded by other methodologies which are more accurate in their prediction of filter response
constant k filters were invented by george campbell he published his work in 1922 but had clearly invented the filters some time before as his colleague at at t co otto zobel was already making improvements to the design at this time campbell's filters were far superior to the simpler single element circuits that had been used previously campbell called his filters electric wave filters but this term later came to mean any filter that passes waves of some frequencies but not others many new forms of wave filter were subsequently invented an early and important variation was the m-derived filter by zobel who coined the term constant k for the campbell filter in order to distinguish them
the great advantage campbell's filters had over the rl circuit and other simple filters of the time was that they could be designed for any desired degree of stop band rejection or steepness of transition between pass band and stop band it was only necessary to add more filter sections until the desired response was obtained
the filters were designed by campbell for the purpose of separating multiplexed telephone channels on transmission lines but their subsequent use has been much more widespread than that the design techniques used by campbell have largely been superseded however the ladder topology used by campbell with the constant k is still in use today with implementations of modern filter designs such as the tchebyscheff filter campbell gave constant k designs for low-pass high-pass and band-pass filters band-stop and multiple band filters are also possible
some of the impedance terms and section terms used in this article are pictured in the diagram below image theory defines quantities in terms of an infinite cascade of two-port sections and in the case of the filters being discussed an infinite ladder network of l-sections here l should not be confused with the inductance l–in electronic filter topology l refers to the specific filter shape which resembles inverted letter l
the sections of the hypothetical infinite filter are made of series elements having impedance 2z and shunt elements with admittance 2y the factor of two is introduced for mathematical convenience since it is usual to work in terms of half-sections where it disappears the image impedance of the input and output port of a section will generally not be the same however for a mid-series section that is a section from halfway through a series element to halfway through the next series element will have the same image impedance on both ports due to symmetry this image impedance is designated zit due to the t topology of a mid-series section likewise the image impedance of a mid-shunt section is designated ziπ due to the π topology half of such a t or π section is called a half-section which is also an l-section but with half the element values of the full l-section the image impedance of the half-section is dissimilar on the input and output ports on the side presenting the series element it is equal to the mid-series zit but on the side presenting the shunt element it is equal to the mid-shunt ziπ there are thus two variant ways of using a half-section
parts of this article or section rely on the reader's knowledge of the complex impedance representation of capacitors and inductors and on knowledge of the frequency domain representation of signals
the building block of constant k filters is the half-section l network composed of a series impedance z and a shunt admittance y. the k in constant k is the value given by
<formula>
thus k will have units of impedance that is ohms it is readily apparent that in order for k to be constant y must be the dual impedance of z. a physical interpretation of k can be given by observing that k is the limiting value of zi as the size of the section in terms of values of its components such as inductances capacitances etc approaches zero while keeping k at its initial value thus k is the characteristic impedance z0 of the transmission line that would be formed by these infinitesimally small sections it is also the image impedance of the section at resonance in the case of band-pass filters or at ω 0 in the case of low-pass filters for example the pictured low-pass half-section has
<formula>
elements l and c can be made arbitrarily small while retaining the same value of k z and y however are both approaching zero and from the formulae below for image impedances
<formula>
see also image impedance derivation
the image impedances of the section are given by
<formula>
and
<formula>
given that the filter does not contain any resistive elements the image impedance in the pass band of the filter is purely real and in the stop band it is purely imaginary for example for the pictured low-pass half-section
<formula>
the transition occurs at a cut-off frequency given by
<formula>
below this frequency the image impedance is real
<formula>
above the cut-off frequency the image impedance is imaginary
<formula>
the transmission parameters for a general constant k half-section are given by
<formula>
and for a chain of n half-sections
<formula>
for the low-pass l-shape section below the cut-off frequency the transmission parameters are given by
<formula>
that is the transmission is lossless in the pass-band with only the phase of the signal changing above the cut-off frequency the transmission parameters are
<formula>
the presented plots of image impedance attenuation and phase change correspond to a low-pass prototype filter section the prototype has a cut-off frequency of ωc
1 ω this is produced by a filter half-section with inductance l
1 farad this prototype can be impedance scaled and frequency scaled to the desired values the low-pass prototype can also be transformed into high-pass band-pass or band-stop types by application of suitable frequency transformations
several l-shape half-sections may be cascaded to form a composite filter like impedance must always face like in these combinations there are therefore two circuits that can be formed with two identical l-shaped half-sections where a port of image impedance zit faces another zit the section is called a π section where ziπ faces ziπ the section so formed is a t section further additions of half-sections to either of these section forms a ladder network which may start and end with series or shunt elements
it should be borne in mind that the characteristics of the filter predicted by the image method are only accurate if the section is terminated with its image impedance this is usually not true of the sections at either end which are usually terminated with a fixed resistance the further the section is from the end of the filter the more accurate the prediction will become since the effects of the terminating impedances are masked by the intervening sections
the snowmen is an episode of the british science fiction television series doctor who first broadcast on christmas day 2012 on bbc one it is the eighth christmas special since the show's 2005 revival and the first to be within a series it was written by head writer and executive producer steven moffat and directed by saul metzstein

to promote the special three prequels were released the first was broadcast during the 2012 children in need telethon on 16 november 2012 titled the great detective the silurian madame vastra her human wife jenny flint and the sontaran strax all returning from a good man goes to war describe a number of strange phenomena to a shadowed fourth detective the fourth detective reveals himself to be the doctor and tells the group that he has retired
a second prequel titled vastra investigates was released online on 17 december 2012 at the end of a case vastra and jenny converse with an officer from scotland yard and apologise for strax's violent wishes for the culprit's punishment vastra explains strax's alien origin as well as her own to the officer much to his astonishment vastra reveals that she was awoken by an extension to the london underground and initially disliked humans though that changed when she fell in love with jenny on the carriage ride home jenny notices it is beginning to snow and vastra notes that the snow should be impossible because there are no clouds in the sky
a third prequel titled the battle of demon's run — two days later was released on the united states itunes and amazon video stores on 25 march 2013 two days after the events of a good man goes to war vastra and jenny convince strax that he is not mortally wounded and invite him to accompany them back to 1800s london the scene had been filmed as an extra due to the anticipation that fans would ask how strax was resurrected and came to be in vastra's employ
in 1842 england a young boy builds a snowman but refuses to play with the other children the snowman starts speaking to the boy repeating his assertions that the other children are silly fifty years later the boy has grown up to be dr. walter simeon proprietor of the great intelligence institute he hires men to collect samples of snow which he places in a large snow-filled globe in his laboratory before feeding the men to a group of animated snowmen the doctor still despondent after losing his former companions amy pond and rory williams has parked his tardis above victorian london among the clouds he uses his allies vastra jenny and strax to keep people away from him they also fill their time investigating mysteries throughout the city
elsewhere barmaid clara oswin oswald investigates a disturbance outside the tavern she works at and finds the doctor walking by he attempts to leave discreetly but clara follows him to a coach not wishing to become involved in matters the doctor instructs strax to bring him a memory worm that will erase the last hour of clara's memories with just a touch before they can do so they are surrounded by snowmen created from snow with psychic properties who attack the group the doctor realises that clara's thoughts are creating the snowmen and ends the threat by instructing her to think of them melting clara cautions the doctor that if he wipes her memory she will forget how to deal with the snowmen the doctor reluctantly allows her to go and ascends a staircase to the sky to return to the tardis clara follows him and knocks on the door but she hides and flees down the staircase when the doctor answers clara returns to her other job as governess for the children of captain latimer she learns that latimer's daughter has been having horrible dreams about their previous governess returning from the dead clara realises that the pond that contains the old governess'body is the only thing still frozen around them she attempts to track down the doctor but instead attracts the attention of jenny who takes her to see vastra vastra tells clara she gets only one word to impress the doctor with if she wants his help clara chooses the word pond which shocks the doctor and arouses his interest
acting on a tip from strax the doctor visits the great intelligence institute posing as sherlock holmes he confronts dr. simeon and find a large glass globe in simeon's office that contains psychic snow the doctor speaks to the great intelligence the entity that has been speaking to dr. simeon since he was a boy he learns that the great intelligence has been controlling the snowmen and has taken interest in latimer's pond the doctor visits the pond and deduces that the great intelligence is using the old governess'body as a dna blueprint to form an ice creature that will retain its form and not melt while clara is putting the children to bed the frozen body of the governess breaks into the house the doctor fights her off and is joined by vastra jenny and strax dr. simeon arrives with more snowmen and tells them he wants the governess'ice body the doctor flees with clara to the roof of the mansion and then to the tardis hovering overhead they are pursued by the ice governess whom the doctor traps under a layer of frozen ice crystals inside the tardis the doctor gives clara a tardis key but the ice governess arrives and pulls clara down off the cloud
the doctor picks up clara and takes her back to latimer's mansion placing her under medical care of strax he collects the ice fragments from the governess and places them in a souvenir london underground biscuit tin he and vastra travel to simeon's lab where the doctor notes the intelligence's plan to replace humanity with ice creatures and holds up the tin with the necessary dna dr simeon grabs the tin and opens it only to find the memory worm which latches on to him the doctor states that the great intelligence which has been existing as a mirror of dr simeon's thoughts will vanish with the erasure of simeon's memories instead the intelligence reveals that it existed long enough that it can now control simeon's body which it uses to attack vastra and the doctor the influence of the great intelligence quickly wanes and simeon falls dead outside a salt-water rain has started and the doctor sees that another psychic ability has taken control of the snow from the great intelligence the latimer family crying for clara strax informs the doctor upon his return to the latimer mansion that clara only has moments left and she passes away as the doctor returns the tardis key to her at her funeral the doctor reads clara's full name on her tombstone and realises she is the woman he met in asylum of the daleks who became a dalek whom he refers to as soufflé girl he gleefully announces that a person dying twice is an impossibility and bidding farewell to his allies for now the doctor departs in the tardis to investigate and find clara the episode concludes in contemporary times where a young woman resembling clara walks through the same graveyard pausing by clara's tombstone
the second doctor previously encountered the great intelligence in the serials the abominable snowmen 1967 set in the 1930s and the web of fear 1968 set in the 1960s in these stories the great intelligence uses robot yeti as its physical presence the events of the web of fear are alluded to by the doctor in the snowmen when he presents the london underground biscuit tin to the great intelligence in dr simeon's laboratory the intelligence states i do not understand these markings in reference to the 1967 london underground map design on the tin the doctor remarks that the underground is a key strategic weakness in metropolitan living referring to and possibly setting in motion the future yeti attack on london via the underground
coleman previously played oswin oswald in asylum of the daleks though the connection between the two characters is not clarified until clara reveals she has an interest in soufflés a trait that oswin's character also had the doctor after meeting clara wistfully replies those were the days when she asks why he isn 't staying to get acquainted with her which are the same words he tells craig owens closing time when craig comments that the doctor always wins the final scenes at the graveyard establish that clara shares the same name as oswin leading the doctor to surmise they are the same person as seen on her gravestone clara's birthdate is 23 november the date doctor who was first transmitted in 1963
writer steven moffat stated that he wanted an epic quality to the christmas special the story would also show how the doctor had responded to losing his previous companions moffat said that i think he's probably reached the point in his life where he's saying ,'friendship for me is just postponed bereavement — i want to be on my own for a while'. moffat compared the withdrawn doctor seen at the onset of the episode to the first appearances of the first doctor william hartnell in 1963 and the ninth doctor christopher eccleston in 2005 he also attributed the idea of a retired doctor to a plot proposed by douglas adams in the 1970s but rejected by the production team at the time continuing the theme introduced with the series'first five episodes the snowmen was promoted like a movie a movie poster was released in the radio times showing the doctor and clara ascending the ladder to the tardis
the episode saw several major design changes for the series the snowmen is the debut of a redesigned tardis interior as well as a new title sequence and variation of the theme tune the new title sequence features a brief glimpse of the doctor's face the first time since survival the final serial of the classic series in 1989 that the doctor's face has been seen in the title sequence moffat had noticed that the tardis'design was getting progressively whimsical and resembled more of a magical place rather than a machine it was designed by series production designer michael pickwood who stated that the new interior was also supposed to be darker and moodier and provide an easier access to the gallery of the ship when shooting
the doctor also wears a one-off costume victorian-themed which smith described as a bit artful dodger meets the doctor moffat described the new outfit as a progression as the doctor was in a different phase of his life now and felt more grown-up and fatherlike the costume was designed by howard burden for this episode the snowmen also contains several references to sherlock holmes including the doctor dressing up as him moffat is co-creator of the bbc series sherlock for which smith auditioned for the role of doctor watson before being cast as the doctor in addition the incidental music during the scene bears a resemblance to the sherlock theme
this episode marks the return of jenna-louise coleman who previously appeared in the series opener asylum of the daleks coleman was cast because of her chemistry with matt smith and especially because she was able to talk faster than him she auditioned for the role of clara not oswin from asylum as the concept of the two characters being the same only occurred to moffat whilst casting for clara the production team requested that the press and fans who attended advanced screenings keep coleman's appearance a secret until asylum was broadcast the effort was ultimately successful moffat stated that the introduction of a new companion made the show feel different and brought the story to a new beginning with a different person meeting the doctor smith said that clara was different from her predecessor amy pond karen gillan which allowed the audience to see a different side of the doctor coleman described her as resourceful and not intimidated citing the reason for following the doctor at the beginning as pursuing answers the clara who would become a travelling companion of the doctor would not debut until the spring premiere the bells of saint john save for a brief cameo at the end of the snowmen coleman stated that she played each version as individuals with trust that there would be a payoff to her mystery
also returning to the series are neve mcintosh as madame vastra dan starkey as strax and catrin stewart as jenny all three previously appeared in a good man goes to war and reprised their roles both in this episode and in the prequels they returned due to the popularity of vastra and jenny moffat considered a spin-off featuring them though he did not have the time to do it instead he decided to bring them back in the main series richard e. grant had previously played the doctor on two occasions as an alternative tenth doctor in the spoof charity special doctor who and the curse of fatal death which was written by moffat and as an alternative ninth doctor in the animated story scream of the shalka which had been intended to be a continuation of the series before it was revived in 2005 smith commented that grant was born to be a who villain he pitches it on that perfect level and tone grant's appearance in doctor who was teased by the bbc via twitter announcing his appearance at midnight 5 august 2012 tom ward was drawn to his role because of the quality of the script and also stated his young children were pleased that he appeared in the programme the great intelligence was voiced by sir ian mckellen the two children clara is governess to digby and francesca were played by real-life brother and sister joseph and ellie darcey-alden
the snowmen was originally intended to be produced in the fourth production block of the series and be the first episode coleman shot as her character however it did not begin filming until the week of 6 august 2012 after coleman had worked on later episodes while moffat was writing the christmas special the read-through had taken place on 2 august 2012 this was the first christmas special to be filmed in bbc wales'new roath lock studios scenes featuring coleman and several guest stars in a victorian setting were filmed in newport wales while coleman and smith were also spotted filming in bristol two weeks later on 21 august some scenes which used snow props were filmed in portland square bristol where filming took place overnight on 21–22 august 2012 bristol was chosen because it had victorian-era architecture pickwood stated that his favourite set is the london street with the back of the pub which he said was based on a sixteenth-century building in oxford the locations were blocked off and sprayed with fake snow
the tardis on the cloud was achieved through a mix of fog on the studio floor and post-production special effects director saul metzstein explained that it was difficult to achieve the desired look for the snowmen the first ones he likened to zippy from rainbow which was too cute of an appearance and so the effects team created more menacing cgi faces clara's introduction to the tardis introduced two novel effects for the show the first was a single-shot camera tracking from a few feet away from the tardis to its interior with the implication of the tardis's trans-dimensional nature shown to the audience in the following shot the camera does a complete circle of the tardis console an effect not seen since the early days of the show metzstein wanted to include this shot to further emphasize the bigger on the inside than the outside nature of the time machine
in addition to the three prequel mini-episodes the cast also filmed an additional promotional video songtaran carols which the bbc uploaded during the days leading up to the broadcast the video featured starkey singing modified versions of several christmas songs in character as strax as his castmates look on before everyone breaks character and begins laughing
the snowmen aired on bbc one on 25 december 2012 at 5 15 pm the same day on bbc america in the us and space in canada and the next day on abc1 in australia and on prime in new zealand uk overnight ratings showed that the special had been watched by 7.6 million viewers coming in sixth for the night final consolidated figures not including bbc iplayer viewers showed that the episode was watched by 9.87 million viewers coming in fourth for the night it also received an appreciation index figure of 87 higher than most of the doctor who christmas specials the iplayer version had 1,467,220 views making it the most popular tv show on iplayer over christmas the us airing was seen by 1.43 million viewers with a 0.6 rating in the demographic of adults aged 18–49
the episode received mostly positive reviews dan martin of the guardian called it actually the best christmas special since'the christmas invasion'" and the first to be actually scary with everything we like about doctor who and christmas he praised coleman's introduction as clara and the gang of vastra jenny and strax ign's matt risley gave the snowmen a score of 9.4 out of 10 describing it as a rollicking riveting masterclass in storytelling which refreshingly lacked traditional christmas references in favour of some sparkling dialogue gorgeous set design and fascinating characterisation while he felt that grant and mckellen were underused he was very positive towards coleman's unpredictable clara radio times reviewer patrick mulkern was pleased with the return of the great intelligence despite an inconsistency in the timeline he found and praised the lovely images and direction of the special though he felt the variation of the theme music lacks the menace of the original while he was positive towards clara he was unmoved by her death as it was plainly silly that she did not look injured
nick setchfield of sfx gave the special four and a half out of five stars writing that the power of emotion saves the day again was appropriate in light of the festivities and many fairytales referenced in the story setchfield was positive towards the terrific comedy with strax coleman and the surprisingly underused grant as well as the new title sequence and tardis while he wrote that the subtle callback of the great intelligence was a tad more interesting than the usual'so we meet again !'schtick he ultimately felt their threat never quite comes into sharp relief neela debnath of the independent wrote that the snowmen was stronger than the previous year's the doctor the widow and the wardrobe as it was connected to the overall story of the series but still has a way to go if it is to live up to'a christmas carol'" despite feeling that it was enjoyable she noted that the story feels truncated and rushed
the mirror's jon cooper also praised coleman and the new side of the doctor that was shown comparing it to rose tyler billie piper challenging the ninth doctor christopher eccleston however he felt the character-heavy story was to the detriment of the plot which was a classic who set-up that ultimately suffers from a lack of explanation and more set-pieces than a coherent whole he felt that the episode may not have been accessible for casual viewers but offered much for fans in time for the programme's fiftieth anniversary dominic cavendish of the daily telegraph gave the snowmen three out of five stars disappointed that it was not as scary as it had been hyped to be while he was positive towards smith and the tardis on the cloud he criticised strax and the sudoku-like complexity of the script
the episode was nominated for the 2013 hugo award for best dramatic presentation short form alongside asylum of the daleks and the angels take manhattan but lost to the game of thrones episode blackwater
the snowmen was initially released as a standalone on dvd and blu-ray in the uk and north america it was later included as part of the dvd blu-ray box set doctor who the complete seventh series in september 2013
it has subsequently been reissued in several box set compilations most recently alongside the christmas specials between the christmas invasion and last christmas inclusive in a boxset titled doctor who–the 10 christmas specials on 19 october 2015
selected pieces of score from the snowmen and the preceding christmas special as composed by murray gold were included on a soundtrack released on 21 october 2013 by silva screen records
no. 20 squadron is a royal australian air force raaf support squadron coming under the control of no. 96 wing it is responsible for the management of the airfield at raaf base woomera south australia the squadron originated as a maritime patrol unit during world war ii raised in august 1941 it operated pby catalina and short empire flying boats from bases in new guinea queensland and the northern territory conducting search-and-rescue mine-laying anti-submarine and bombing missions against japanese targets in the pacific theatre following the conclusion of hostilities the squadron was disbanded in march 1946 it was reactivated as an airfield support squadron in april 2015
no. 20 squadron was formed at port moresby new guinea on 1 august 1941 for a general reconnaissance role under the command of squadron leader w.n. gibson its establishment was six pby catalina flying boats and 133 personnel but only five aircraft all transferred from no. 11 squadron and 55 personnel were available initially the squadron conducted long-range patrols between bases scattered around the islands to australia's north in conjunction with no. 11 squadron on 18 november no. 20 squadron's catalinas were augmented by two short empire flying boats transferred from no. 11 squadron
on 25 november 1941 following the loss of hmas sydney one of no. 20 squadron's catalinas was despatched to western australia to join a no. 11 squadron catalina in search-and-rescue missions but they found only oil slicks by the outbreak of war in the pacific no. 20 squadron had a strength of six catalinas and two empire flying boats its personnel at the beginning of december numbered 14 officers and 118 men the squadron undertook its first sortie of the pacific war on 8 december a catalina located three japanese luggers in the vicinity of thursday island queensland later in the month it commenced anti-submarine patrols and in january 1942 bombing raids against japanese bases as the japanese advanced into the south west pacific no. 20 squadron was also responsible for evacuating white civilians from areas threatened by invasion on 21 january one of its catalinas located the japanese fleet steaming for rabaul and signalled a warning to the town's australian defenders before being shot down by anti-aircraft fire it was the squadron's first combat loss
in the wake of the fall of rabaul the catalinas of nos. 11 and 20 squadrons became the raaf's only offensive weapon against the japanese their raids on rabaul did little to stem the japanese advance and in the following months port moresby itself was subjected to increasingly frequent attacks which destroyed aircraft facilities and squadron records in february 1942 the short empires operated by nos. 11 and 20 squadrons were transferred to the newly formed no. 33 transport squadron no. 20 squadron lost two catalinas during patrols on 4 and 6 may the nine crewmen of the first were later found to have been captured and beheaded the crew of the second were also captured and subsequently disappeared without trace
in response to the threat of invasion at port moresby nos. 11 and 20 squadrons moved to bowen queensland on 7 may 1942 they were soon attacking japanese targets in lae salamaua and rabaul on 27 june each squadron contributed an aircraft to a four-hour raid over lae and salamaua during which as well as bombs the raaf crews dropped beer bottles to disrupt the enemy soldiers'sleep — the sound they made falling through the air was according to the official history something between a shrill whistle and a scream by 1 july no. 20 squadron's strength was six catalinas and 175 personnel out of a planned establishment of nine aircraft and 415 personnel its prime responsibility in early 1942 was maritime reconnaissance as far as new guinea the solomon islands and new caledonia the latter half of the year saw a greater focus on night bombing now comprising 252 officers and men the squadron relocated to cairns on 11 november 1942 from cairns it continued to conduct reconnaissance anti-submarine and occasional bombing operations over the waters around new guinea between december 1942 and march 1943 no. 20 squadron's aircraft flew a total of 9,629 hours and dropped 227 tons of bombs the squadron's role changed in june 1943 when it commenced mine-laying operations over the netherlands east indies and the philippines though it continued to make some bombing raids and supply drops
in september 1944 no. 20 squadron became part of no. 76 wing raaf along with nos. 42 and 43 squadrons and moved to darwin northern territory all three squadrons operated catalinas their primary purpose being mine-laying on the night of 30 september a catalina of no. 20 squadron was shot down while attacking a ship at pomelaa in the dutch east indies the loss was compounded by the fact that one of the coordinators of the mining campaign lieutenant commander p.e. carr of the royal australian navy was aboard the plane and was captured by the japanese another of the squadron's catalinas went down on the night of 27 28 january 1945 possibly in a cyclone over the timor sea during the campaign to mine surabaya in march a detachment of four no. 20 squadron aircraft along with four from no. 43 squadron laid mines off the coast of southern china and formossa as part of a no. 76 wing offensive in this area these operations were conducted from leyte gulf in the philippines one of no. 20 squadron's catalinas was lost on the night of 7 8 march most likely owing to bad weather rather than enemy action three of the squadron's aircraft mined the entrance to hong kong harbour on 8 april and on 26 may four of its catalinas mined wenchow harbour in china the furthest north that any australian aircraft infiltrated during the war in the pacific three of its aircraft flew the raaf's last mine-laying mission on 30 july
no. 20 squadron's final wartime sortie was a patrol on 14 august 1945 following the end of the war the squadron operated in the transport role and ferried australian prisoners of war home from various locations in south east asia it relocated to raaf station rathmines new south wales on 21 november no. 20 squadron flew its last mission a transport flight to balikpapan on 21 january 1946 and disbanded at rathmines on 27 march
no. 20 squadron was reactivated on 1 april 2015 to support airfield operations at raaf base woomera south australia consisting of nine uniformed personnel and one australian public service member under the command of squadron leader simon bartlett the squadron formed part of no. 96 wing a component of combat support group csg the airfield had previously been managed under the auspices of aerospace operational support group but a command-and-control review commissioned by the chief of air force recommended that in common with other raaf airfields it should be administered by csg raaf base woomera incorporating woomera village was one of two air force units formally established on 12 january 2015 as part of a reorganisation of the woomera range complex the other unit being raaf woomera test range
the design of the reactivated squadron's crest includes a wedge-tailed eagle to denote courage and nobility a woomera spear thrower to symbolise the town and its indigenous heritage sturt's desert pea to represent south australia and the pleiades star cluster which features in the folklore of the local kokatha people
the light tank mk vii a17 also known as the tetrarch was a british light tank produced by vickers-armstrongs in the late 1930s and deployed during the world war ii the tetrarch was originally designed as the latest in the line of light tanks built by the company for the british army it improved upon its predecessor the mk vib light tank by introducing the extra firepower of a 2-pounder gun the war office ordered 70 tanks an order that eventually increased to 220 production was delayed by several factors and as a consequence only 100 to 177 of the tanks were produced
the tank's design flaws combined with the decision by the war office not to use light tanks in british armoured divisions ruled out the use of tetrarchs in the north african campaign as a result the majority of the tanks remained in britain although 20 were sent to the ussr as part of the lend-lease program in early 1941 the royal armoured corps formed three squadrons for use in overseas amphibious operations one of which was equipped with tetrarchs in may 1942 a small number of tetrarchs formed part of the british force which participated in the invasion of madagascar and in june 1942 tetrarchs were attached to the 1st airborne division after it was decided that the design allowed its use as an air-portable light tank to support british airborne forces the tetrarchs were transported and landed in specially designed general aircraft hamilcar gliders a lack of gliders prevented their participation in the allied invasion of sicily in 1943 instead they were attached to the new 6th airborne division and became part of the 6th airborne armoured reconnaissance regiment
the division used approximately 20 tetrarchs during the british airborne landings in normandy in june 1944 the tanks were successfully landed by glider but they did not perform well several were lost in accidents and those that did see action proved to be inferior in firepower and armour to the armoured fighting vehicles of the german forces a few days after the beginning of the operation the tanks were removed from direct engagement with german armour and used only to provide fire support by august 1944 most of the tetrarchs in action were replaced with cromwell cruiser tanks and the remainder were replaced by the m22 locust in december 1944
tetrarchs did not see any further combat and were deemed obsolete by 1946 the last was retired in 1950 there were several variations on the tetrarch design including the alecto self-propelled gun and the light tank mk viii but none of these were ever used in active service with the british army
the prototype of the light tank mk vii a17 nicknamed'purdah', was first developed in 1937 by vickers-armstrongs as a private venture and was intended to be sold either to the british army or to foreign militaries it was to be the latest in a series of light tanks produced by the company the tank was designed to overcome the shortcomings of insufficient armament in earlier light tanks that were fitted only with machine guns vickers-armstrong installed on the mk viis a 2-pounder 40-millimetre 1.6 in main gun paired with a 7.92-millimetre 0.312 in besa machine gun and mounted the two guns in a two-man turret the tank possessed a maximum of 14 millimetres 0.55 in of armour the prototype weighed approximately 16,800 pounds 7,600 kg and was powered by a 165-horsepower 123 kw meadows engine suspension was on eight road wheels four per side with no separate driver or idler wheels and it was capable of a 40 miles per hour 64 km h top speed the mk vii design relied on an unusual steering method and a mechanical system incorporated into earlier vickers models the front wheels could be steered to allow for gentle turns by bending the tracks for sharper turns the system returned to the conventional method of braking one track to turn the tank the dual system of turning was designed to lessen mechanical strain on the mkvii and reduce its power wastage the suspension system was also a new design that relied on struts with pockets of air for springing and cushions of oil for damping and each of the wheels was independently sprung
the war office examined the design and put the prototype through a series of trials during may and june 1938 the model was tested as a possible light cruiser since war office light tank needs were already met by its predecessor the mark vi the war office then took the view that the tank was not acceptable as a light cruiser because the nuffield a13 offered better speed and obstacle crossing performance despite this it was decided that it was essential for some tetrarchs to be produced and it was suggested that they be brought in at the end of the light tank program accordingly the war office gave the tetrarch the official general staff specification number a17 and in november 1938 accepted it for limited production after requesting a few minor changes which included the fitting of an external fuel tank to increase the tank's range
the number to be produced was subject to fluctuation as the war office vacillated in their demand in july 1938 it requested that 70 of the tanks be produced then increased the request to 120 after a three-day conference in november production was to begin in july 1940 but meanwhile the war office temporarily returned to its original order of 70 before increasing the number to 100 the number further increased to 220 after metropolitan cammell carriage and wagon a company part owned by vickers-armstrong that would be producing the tanks indicated it had already ordered armour plating for that many tanks
production of the tank was delayed by a number of factors the war office put their order on hold in a post-battle of france decision to focus military production on infantry and cruiser tanks due to the poor performance of british light tanks during that battle due to the shortage of more suitable tanks light tanks that were not designed for use against german armour were nevertheless deployed against them the resulting high casualties led the war office to re-evaluate the suitability of the light tank design the pre-war role of the light tank that of reconnaissance meanwhile had been found to be better suited to scout cars that used smaller crews and had better cross-country abilities further delays were caused by the bombing raids of the luftwaffe during may 1941 against the factories where the tanks were assembled
the cumulative effect of these delays resulted in the production of only a small number of mk viis estimates place the final total produced to be between 100 and 177 the name'tetrarch'was given to the mk vii on 22 september 1941 on the orders of the war office the last of the tanks were built in the first quarter of 1942 and delivered at the end of the year
the war office and the army were concluding at this point that light tanks were a liability and too vulnerable for use in further combat and the tetrarch was considered to be obsolete this decision may have marked the end for the tetrarch in active service several of the tanks destined to be deployed to the eighth army in the middle east for the north african campaign were left in britain when their cooling systems were determined to be unable to cope with the intense north african heat
the demise of tetrarch was prevented by a decision made by the war office in mid-1941 as it was considering the equipment to be used by britain's fledgling airborne forces formed in june 1940 under the orders of the prime minister winston churchill when selecting the equipment for the airborne forces officials at the war office concluded that gliders would be an integral component gliders would transport troops and heavy equipment which by 1941 was to include artillery and some form of tank plans to transport a tank went through a number of revisions but by may 1941 the feasibility of a 5.5 metric tons 5.4 long tons tank to be carried for 350 miles 560 km in a glider was accepted although the aircraft would have to be specifically designed for the task in a conference held on 16 january 1941 it was decided that the general aircraft hamilcar currently under development would be used to transport a single tetrarch tank or two universal carriers the tetrarch was chosen because it was an obsolete design and was therefore available to be used by the airborne forces
beginning in january 1944 training exercises were conducted carrying the tetrarchs and their crews inside hamilcar gliders these exercises were successful during the training by'c'squadron of the glider pilot regiment which specialised in flying the hamilcars over 2,800 lifts were made with an average of 50 lifts per crew only three incidents resulted in fatalities or injuries with seven pilots killed during the training when the tetrarch was re-designated as an airborne tank several changes were made to its design a number of tanks had their 2 pounder guns replaced with a 76.2-millimetre 3.00 in infantry support howitzer these tanks were then designated as tetrarch 1 cs close support additionally littlejohn adaptors were added to those tetrarchs which still possessed their 2 pounders to increase their muzzle velocity and armour penetration
the tetrarch experienced several setbacks throughout its development and deployment with the army and airborne forces one of the major problems was the limited number of these tanks that existed after production ended in 1942 which particularly affected the airborne forces the transport of 20 of the tanks to the ussr under the lend-lease act depleted the number available for use by airborne forces as did the loss of several more during operation ironclad the invasion of madagascar a royal armoured corps report issued in december 1942 stated that approximately 50 tetrarchs were available for use in a memorandum dated january 1943 by major general george f. hopkinson commander of the 1st airborne division hopkinson complained that he had been informed that 70 of the tanks were available whereas only 50 actually remained with no reserves to replace those lost in combat this lack of sufficient replacement reserves combined with a war office report that some 287 airborne tanks would be required for the 1st airborne division and an unnamed airborne division to be formed in india led to the tetrarch's eventual replacement by the us m22 locust
a number of design faults of the tetrarch were revealed through its operational use its size limited the possible crew to three a driver in the hull and a gunner and commander in the turret resulting in too few crew members to operate the tetrarch effectively the gunner or commander in addition to his own duties had to act as loader for the 2 pounder which caused delays in combat a report on the tank written in january 1941 stated that as the commander had to both fight and control the tank controlling a troop of tetrarchs during combat would be almost impossible
problems were also found with the littlejohn adaptor fitted to the 2-pounder to increase its range and penetration power after they had been fitted the adapters could not be removed and could only fire specially designed armour-piercing rounds which took time to manufacture
the war office also considered the tetrarch's cooling system faulty making the tank unsuitable for service in hotter climates such as the middle east and north africa
the first tetrarchs were delivered to the army in november 1940 and were initially deployed with the 1st armoured division which was being refitted after losing the majority of its previous tanks during the battle of france and the newly formed 6th armoured division however the faults discovered with the tetrarch cooling system precluded them from being integrated into units that were sent to the middle east to participate in the north african campaign shortly after all light tanks were discarded from the establishments of british armoured divisions as not suitable for further service
the tetrarchs remained in britain and would probably have been used as training vehicles before being retired from service but on 22 june 1941 the german invasion of the ussr operation barbarossa began and the ussr became an ally of britain the lend-lease program begun in march 1941 by the united states of america to supply defensive materials to britain and china was therefore extended to the ussr as part of the program the british government began supplying war materials to the ussr which in early 1942 included a shipment of 20 tetrarchs as well as a number of valentine and matilda mk i infantry tanks the soviet military utilised a greater number of light tanks than the british and so could use the tetrarchs when the tanks arrived in the ussr however it was apparent that the design problems with the cooling system were also present in cold conditions additionally the cold weather had a deleterious effect on the tank's suspension and tracks additional testing of the tetrarchs was conducted by the soviet military and the design was admired for its controllability manoeuvrability and speed as well its ability to run on low-quality fuel unlike contemporary soviet designs the thinness of the tetrarch's armour was found to be a problem and one which could not be solved as the weight of extra armour plating caused an unacceptable reduction in the tank's speed despite these drawbacks in the tetrarch's design soviet authorities believed it to be comparable to the t-70 light tank in use at the time and decided that it was suitable to be used in combat a number of tetrarchs were sent to tank training schools which were subsequently sent into battle and in september 1943 two were assigned to the 132nd separated tank battalion which was attached to the 5th guards tank brigade both tanks were destroyed in combat one on 30 september and the other on 2 october the latter a casualty of artillery fire several were also used for propaganda purposes appearing in photographs of soviet troops who were fighting in the caucasus region
in mid-1941 the royal armoured corps in britain created three tank squadrons for special overseas operations known as'a','b'and'c'special service squadrons both'a'and'b'squadrons were equipped with valentine infantry tanks and mark vic light tanks but'c'squadron was equipped with twelve tetrarchs transferred from the 2nd armoured brigade 1st armoured division on 31 july 1941 ,'c'squadron was officially activated and immediately received orders to prepare for overseas service alongside'a'and'b'squadrons in an unspecified tropical climate all three squadrons were transported to inverary in scotland for intensive training that focused on embarkation and disembarkation from ships and landing craft to prepare them for action in potential amphibious operations in early september elements of'c'squadron including six tetrarchs formed part of a force which sailed for freetown in west africa during this period of the war there were fears that the spanish government might enter the conflict on the side of germany and the force was readied to capture a number of spanish islands off the coast of africa if this occurred these fears proved groundless and in march 1942 the unit returned to britain to join the rest of the squadron in training
the next assignment operation ironclad was the invasion of madagascar the third largest island in the world and then under vichy french control the prime minister and the combined chiefs of staff decided that madagascar should be occupied as rapidly as possible to deny the port of antsirane to japanese naval forces which had recently advanced into the indian ocean operation ironclad was under the command of major general robert g. sturges and consisted of no. 5 commando 29th independent brigade group and the 17th and 13th brigade groups from 5th infantry division the 29th brigade formed the core of the invasion force due to its training in amphibious operations and under its command was'b'special service squadron created by amalgamating six valentines from'b'squadron and six tetrarchs from'c'squadron into a single unit the squadron was formed into four troops one headquarters troop of three valentines and one tetrarch one of four valentines and two formed from the remaining five tetrarchs the invasion force assembled off the west coast of the northern tip of madagascar on 4 may near antsirane and the bay of diego suarez the invasion plan called for an amphibious assault landing on four beaches on the west side of the tip which would allow the british forces to advance approximately 20 miles 32 km and approach antsirane from the rear information about the landing beaches the defences possessed by the port and the vichy french defending forces was limited and vague although it was believed that the defenders had no weapons capable of penetrating the armour of a valentine tank
the landings began at 04 30 on 5 may with 5 commando landing at courrier bay and the three infantry brigades and'b'squadron landing at ambararata bay the objective of the infantry brigades and their armoured support was to take control of antsirane and a nearby town but although the infantry landed successfully ,'b'squadron had more trouble the area of beach designated for its landing craft was blocked for several hours after a tetrarch came loose from a landing craft and became stuck in the sand the infantry brigades advanced toward antsirane without the squadron but eventually two valentines and a single tetrarch were dispatched in support catching up with the lead elements of the infantry near the town of anamakia here the invasion force encountered the first french defences consisting of camouflaged trenches and pillboxes dug in along a ridge the tanks attempted to breach them but the rocky ground made manoeuvring difficult and they could not close with the pillboxes and trenches they engaged a number of targets with 2 pounder and machine-gun fire but the line had to be cleared by an infantry assault later in the day the tanks were ordered to outflank the defences and advance further into the island and they were soon joined by two other tetrarchs dispatched from the beaches the small force continued to advance until it encountered the vichy french main line of defence this had been built prior to the first world war and included camouflaged pillboxes machine-gun nests and dug-in 75 mm artillery pieces the latter although not specifically designed for an anti-tank role could penetrate the armour of both the tetrarchs and the valentines the two valentines advanced first but were knocked out by artillery fire and two tetrarchs that were moving behind them suffered the same fate the third tetrarch retreated in order to report on the french resistance machine gunning a motorcycle combination and a truck it encountered on the way back
the commander of the tetrarch made his report and was then ordered to take command of four valentines and two tetrarchs which had recently arrived and once again attempt to breach the french defences the tanks followed the road leading to the defensive line and then attempted to out-flank the line by advancing from the right-hand side using several hills as cover the artillery pieces were able to turn and face the assault however and one valentine and one tetrarch were hit and destroyed the remaining tanks exchanged several volleys of fire with the artillery pieces before retreating back to their original positions the french line was eventually broken by 29th brigade aided by an amphibious assault by royal marines the remaining tanks of'b'squadron two valentines and three tetrarchs remained in defensive positions until the afternoon of 6 may coming under sporadic artillery fire which disabled another valentine the squadron played no further part in the battle as the vichy french authorities negotiated a formal surrender the following day although french troops would continue to engage the british occupying force in guerrilla warfare until late november .'c'squadron suffered heavy casualties during the invasion only one valentine and three tetrarchs out of twelve tanks were functional by 7 may and the squadron had suffered seven killed and six wounded it remained in madagascar until early 1943 when it was shipped to india and took part in the burma campaign as part of 29th brigade
because of a lack of equipment training facilities in mid-1940 when the british airborne establishment was formed the war office was able to accept only 500 volunteers for training as airborne troops progress in setting up proper training facilities and acquiring suitable transport aircraft was so slow that the first british airborne operation operation colossus was conducted by a retrained commando unit by 1942 there existed specifically trained airborne units including the 1st airborne division and on 19 january 1942 the war office decided that a light tank unit would be one of the support units attached to the division this unit designated the light tank squadron was to be formed of nineteen light tanks and would operate to the fore of the division using their tanks'speed to capture objectives and then holding them until relieved by other units the obvious unit for conversion was'c'special services squadron as it was trained to act as an independent tank unit and more importantly was the only unit that was still using tetrarchs it had been re-designated as an airborne tank by the war office .'c'squadron was officially transferred to the 1st airborne division on 24 june 1942 bringing with it seven tetrarchs among its other vehicles the unit immediately began training but was not attached to the 1st airborne division for long during mid-1943 the division was transported to the middle east so it could participate in the allied invasion of sicily .'c'squadron remained in britain as not enough hamilcar gliders had been built by the time the division departed to transport its tetrarchs the squadron was transferred to the 6th airborne division which had been raised in april 1943 and'c'squadron remained with it for the rest of the conflict the squadron continued to train as an air-portable unit and participated in a number of exercises to prepare for its new duties including reconnaissance of enemy positions and counter-attacking enemy infantry and armour
on 13 december 1943 the war office decided to expand the squadron into a regiment equipped with a combination of light tanks and conventional reconnaissance vehicles such as scout cars and on 1 april 1944 it was re-designated as the 6th airborne armoured reconnaissance regiment the regiment consisted of a headquarters squadron a light tank squadron and a reconnaissance squadron two tetrarchs the mark 1 cs variation were attached to the headquarters squadron but the light tank squadron also known as'a'squadron received the majority of the tetrarchs .'a'squadron had approximately nineteen tetrarchs split between six troops two of which were of the cs variation and the rest were armed with 2 pounders fitted with littlejohn adaptors on 24 may 1944 after participating in a further series of exercises and manoeuvres ,'a'squadron moved from their training area to a transit camp at tarrant rushton airfield while the rest of the regiment moved to raf brize norton airfield the next day from these two airfields the regiment would be transported from to participate in the british airborne landings in normandy the operation began on the night of 5 june with the deployment of 6th airborne division to eastern normandy it was tasked with protecting the eastern flank of the allied seaborne landings securing strategically important areas east of caen capturing several important bridges over the caen canal and river dives and destroying a coastal artillery battery insufficient transport aircraft were available to land all three of the division's brigades simultaneously one would have to be landed in a second lift later in the day major general richard gale had initially intended for the 6th airlanding brigade to which the 6th airborne armoured reconnaissance regiment was attached to be landed first however aerial photography revealed that anti-glider poles had been erected in the landing zone selected for the brigade therefore gale decided that the 3rd parachute brigade and 5th parachute brigade which did not utilise gliders should land in the first lift to clear the landing zones allowing the 6th airlanding brigade to land in the second lift
the horsa and hamilcar gliders of the brigade landed at 21 00 on 6 june in a landing zone cleared of obstructions by the 5th parachute brigade the primary tasks of the brigade were to bring in reinforcements and supplies and to aid the two parachute brigades in consolidating the area held by the division the 6th airborne armoured reconnaissance squadron was to aid in the latter task acting as a reconnaissance force to scout out german positions and impede the movement of german forces attempting to counter-attack the tetrarchs of'a'squadron were to play an integral part in this reconnaissance role due to their speed but the squadron's strength of twenty tanks was severely depleted by the time it landed in normandy it lost one tank before the formation landed when the tetrarch broke loose of its shackles and crashed through the nose of the glider that was carrying it causing both to fall into the sea mid-flight the squadron's strength was further weakened when two gliders collided with each other in the landing zone destroying themselves and the tetrarchs they carried a third hamilcar hit another tetrarch as it was being unloaded and flipped the tank upside down rendering it unusable although the crew escaped without injury the surviving tanks were then rendered temporarily immobile when parachute rigging lines became tangled in their suspensions forcing their crews to cut the lines away with welding torches
the squadron retrieved all of the remaining tetrarchs and advanced to the south of the landing zone to link up with the rest of the regiment there they received orders to support the 8th parachute battalion in the bois de bavent area and conduct reconnaissance duties after linking with the battalion the squadron began reconnoitring and engaged german infantry and armour they encountered by the end of 7 june two tetrarchs had been lost to enemy action one destroyed by a german self-propelled gun and the second by hitting a mine the division was reinforced by british troops who were advancing from the invasion beaches and it began to push through normandy while the squadron continued its reconnaissance duties at this time gale decided to avoid when possible engaging the tetrarchs with german armour as they proved to be completely outclassed by the german tanks and self-propelled guns such as the panzer iv and the sturmgeschütz iii instead when the division required armoured support it summoned it from armoured units outside the division and the tetrarchs were used to support infantry patrols and provide fire support by august in the division's preparation for the planned breakout from the normandy bridgehead the majority of tetrarchs in'a'squadron were replaced with cromwell fast cruiser tanks only three tetrarchs remained assigned to the headquarters troop of'a'squadron
operation tonga was the last that tetrarchs saw of active combat during the first week of october 1944 the 6th airborne armoured reconnaissance regiment underwent an extensive reorganization in which it was completely restructured and all the remaining tetrarchs were retired they were replaced with the m22 locust a purpose-built airborne light tank of american design eight locusts were used by the regiment in march 1945 during operation varsity the airborne operation to cross the river rhine a report issued by the director air of the war office in january 1946 confirmed that the tetrarch design was considered obsolete and any light tanks used in post-war airborne formations would be entirely new in design a small number of tetrarchs remained in service with the 3rd hussars until 1949 a hamilcar glider flight was stationed at raf fairford and a troop of tetrarchs was kept by the regiment for training exercises with the gliders however glider training by the regiment was stopped in 1950 and the tetrarchs withdrawn from service
there were several variants of the tetrarch design the first was the light tank mk viii vickers-armstrong's proposed successor to the tetrarch the mark viii was also known as the harry hopkins named after president roosevelt's chief diplomatic advisor and was given the general staff design number a25 by the war office the mark viii was intended to improve upon the design of the tetrarch in a number of areas it had thicker armour than the tetrarch with the front hull and turret armour increased to a thickness of 38 millimetres 1.5 in and the side armour to 17 millimetres 0.67 in and the turret and hull given more sloped surfaces to help deflect shells fired at the tank the dimensions of the tetrarch were also changed the mark viii was longer by 6 inches 0.15 m wider by 1 foot 3 inches 0.38 m and heavier the new tank was no longer air-portable as it was too heavy to be carried by a hamilcar the 12-cylinder engine of the tetrarch was fitted to the mark viii although the increased weight meant that its maximum speed decreased to 30 miles per hour 48 km h its armament also remained the same as that of the tetrarch the war office authorised the construction of three prototype models in april 1941 the new design was considered a success and the tank board of the war office ordered 1,000 to be constructed in september however problems were encountered with further tests of the prototypes and a report issued in december 1942 stated that production of the mark viii had been delayed due to developmental problems these problems continued to persist into 1943 when the war office decided against using the tank in active service approximately 100 mark viiis were produced by 1945 when production ended
a second variant on the tetrarch design was the tetrarch duplex drive tetrarch dd the duplex drive system was invented by nicholas straussler and was designed to allow a tank to'swim'through water and participate in amphibious operations the system functioned by erecting a large waterproof canvas screen around the tank above its tracks which was supported by thirty-six inflatable tubes and steel struts this gave the tank sufficient buoyancy to float and was then propelled along by a small propeller powered by the tank's engine the screen could be collapsed by using a small explosive charge once the tank reached land the system was fitted during june 1941 as the tetrarch was the lightest light tank available at the time the converted tank was successfully tested on a number of lakes and reservoirs allowing the duplex drive system to be tested on heavier tanks such as the valentine the system would be used during operation overlord when m4 sherman medium tanks would land on the invasion beaches
quackshot known in japan as i love donald duck georgia ou no hihou japanese アイラブドナルドダック グルジア王の宝 hepburn ai rabu donarudo dakku gurujia ō no hihō is a 1991 platforming video game developed and published by sega for the sega genesis the game was released in europe in 1991 in north america on december 19 1991 and in japan on december 20 1991 quackshot stars donald duck and his three nephews huey dewey and louie as treasure-hunters and is part of a series of games published by sega that were based on walt disney cartoon characters
quackshot was released to mostly positive reviews from video game journalists the game was universally lauded for its graphics with magazines like sega pro describing them as some of the best graphics around the game was also praised for its music and puzzles as well as their clever use in the game however quackshot was criticized for its controls being described by ign as float-y and making certain segments of the game unnecessarily difficult the game was also criticized for its lack of difficulty overall as well as its lack of speech samples which several other genesis games of the time had
the player as donald ventures through a variety of side-scrolling levels generally each level is divided into an overland part and a dungeon such as the maharajah's palace or the temple in which the great duck treasure resides although the player may choose any order to play the overland sections various obstacles prevent the player from entering the dungeons outside of a specific order in addition to this some levels provide the player with vital clues which solve puzzles needed to progress in later sections once donald has completed the overland section of an area he may leave by calling his nephews'biplane and will return to the dungeon entrance of that area if the player chooses to return
donald is armed with a special gun that can shoot plungers popcorn or bubble gum donald has unlimited plungers which can only temporarily stun enemies though bosses can still be damaged with plungers and can collect popcorn and gum along the way or get the latter from gyro gearloose later in the game the plunger is upgraded to act as a temporary platform to climb walls with and when stuck to a passing bird allows donald to traverse longer distances in duckburg india and egypt donald can also pick up chili peppers which increase his temper eventually temporarily allowing him to become invincible increase his speed and knock out enemies in his path
while donald is flipping through some books in scrooge mcduck's library a map falls out of a book relating to the treasure of king garuzia ruler of the great duck kingdom in ancient times the map leads to the location of the king's most prized possession hidden in a secret place shortly before his death donald thinks this is his path to riches unfortunately big bad pete overhears and pursues donald throughout the game hoping to steal the treasure
teamed with his nephews huey dewey and louie and using the partial map from the library donald begins his search in duckburg with the trail being directed to an aztec pyramid in mexico outside the pyramid he is directed by a sweet seniorita to obtain a hero key from an explorer back in duckburg to open the pyramid inside the pyramid donald meets goofy who gives him a strange note and a plunger to help him reach higher places and tells him that gyro gearloose is looking for him back in duckburg travelling across the rooftops of duckburg to meet gyro donald is given gyro's latest invention bubblegum ammo that can break through walls the last location on the partial map is count dracula's castle in transylvania where donald encounters a ghost who tells him that the count carries the real treasure map
after defeating dracula donald receives a more complete map in india donald enters the palace of the maharajah where she challenges him to defeat the tiger in her garden in exchange for a sphinx tear donald succeeds and receives the sphinx tear which is the key to open a temple in egypt donald is able to solve the riddle of the sphinx using the note goofy had given him and obtains the scepter of ra before escaping in a mine cart from there he journeys to the south pole where he finds a key frozen in ice and uses the scepter of ra to melt the ice and grab the key the key unlocks the hold of a viking ship which contains an ancient diary with the secret to locating the treasure the ship is haunted by ghosts and the viking captain sends donald below decks to get rid of them after defeating a skeletal viking warrior donald returns to the deck where the captain informs him that the diary is hidden in ice near the south pole and gives him an ancient viking plunger that attaches to flying creatures donald then returns to the south pole hitching a ride on one of pete's bird minions to reach the diary
however upon finding the diary pete shows up holding donald's nephews hostage in exchange for the diary after giving pete the diary donald travels to pete's hideout to defeat pete and get the diary back the diary reveals that the map when dipped in water will reveal the location of the great duck treasure donald flies to the island where the treasure is hidden and manages to evade its traps in order to reach the treasure vault after defeating the ancient spirit guarding the treasure donald opens the vault only to find a simple stone statue when the disappointed donald returns home huey dewey and louie accidentally break the statue which reveals a golden jeweled necklace was hidden inside donald gives the necklace to daisy and the two fly off into the sunset together
quackshot was developed and published by sega for the sega genesis as part of a series of games that were based on walt disney cartoon characters the game was released in europe in 1991 in north america on december 19 1991 and in japan on december 20 1991 quackshot was later released as part of a bundle called the disney collection for genesis in 1996 alongside castle of illusion the game was also ported to the sega saturn and released exclusively in japan alongside castle of illusion again as part of the sega ages series in 1998 entitled sega ages i love mickey mouse
quackshot received a mostly positive response from critics upon release gamerankings an aggregator for video game reviews assigned the game a score of 77 based on 2 reviews mega placed the game at 7 in their top mega drive games of all time list megatech magazine praised the game's graphics but criticized the game's easy difficulty level explaining simply that the graphics are excellent but the game is easy to complete damian butt from sega pro also praised the graphics stating that the game has without a doubt some of the best graphics around and that the sprites and backgrounds are consistently excellent he also noted the game's various puzzles and their use in the game explaining that e ven if the ideas are not original the way they are strung together to accelerate the pace to overload is nothing short of breath-taking levi buchanan from ign gave quackshot a 7.3 10 also lauding the graphics and animation as excellent and saying the music was pleasing
butt criticized donald's controls in certain situations in the game as well as the difficulty of some levels and puzzles buchanan also criticized the controls calling them float-y and noted the difficulty in executing precision jumps explaining that i t's far too easy to over- or under-shoot a narrow column and slip to your doom butt was also dubious of the number of credits stating that the game may seem easy with unlimited continues but that the player will still need considerable skill to reach the treasure island buchanan was disappointed with the lack of speech samples explaining that it's a bit of a drag with a character that is so defined by his voice ultimately butt said that y ounger players will instantly be enthralled by donald's quest and that quackshot is everything a cartoon game should be and more buchanan summed up the game as being a good platformer tripped up by some questionable controls and recommended the game as a mildly enjoyable 16-bit platformer that would fit nicely in your genesis collection
the olmec colossal heads are at least seventeen monumental stone representations of human heads sculpted from large basalt boulders the heads date from at least before 900 bc and are a distinctive feature of the olmec civilization of ancient mesoamerica all portray mature men with fleshy cheeks flat noses and slightly crossed eyes their physical characteristics correspond to a type that is still common among the inhabitants of tabasco and veracruz the backs of the monuments often are flat the boulders were brought from the sierra de los tuxtlas mountains of veracruz given that the extremely large slabs of stone used in their production were transported over large distances requiring a great deal of human effort and resources it is thought that the monuments represent portraits of powerful individual olmec rulers each of the known examples has a distinctive headdress the heads were variously arranged in lines or groups at major olmec centres but the method and logistics used to transport the stone to these sites remain unclear
the discovery of a colossal head at tres zapotes in the nineteenth century spurred the first archaeological investigations of olmec culture by matthew stirling in 1938 seventeen confirmed examples are known from four sites within the olmec heartland on the gulf coast of mexico most colossal heads were sculpted from spherical boulders but two from san lorenzo tenochtitlán were re-carved from massive stone thrones an additional monument at takalik abaj in guatemala is a throne that may have been carved from a colossal head this is the only known example from outside the olmec heartland
dating the monuments remains difficult because of the movement of many from their original contexts prior to archaeological investigation most have been dated to the early preclassic period 1500–1000 bc with some to the middle preclassic 1000–400 bc period the smallest weigh 6 tons while the largest is variously estimated to weigh 40 to 50 tons although it was abandoned and left unfinished close to the source of its stone
the olmec civilization developed in the lowlands of southeastern mexico between 1500 and 400 bc the olmec heartland lies on the gulf coast of mexico within the states of veracruz and tabasco an area measuring approximately 275 kilometres 171 mi east to west and extending about 100 kilometres 62 mi inland from the coast the olmecs are regarded as the first civilization to develop in mesoamerica and the olmec heartland is one of six cradles of civilization worldwide the others being the norte chico culture of south america the erlitou culture of china's yellow river the indus valley civilization of south asia the civilization of ancient egypt and the sumerian civilization of ancient iraq of these only the olmec civilization developed in a lowland tropical forest setting
the olmecs were the first inhabitants of the americas to construct monumental architecture and to settle in towns and cities they were also the first people in the americas to develop a sophisticated style of stone sculpture in the first decade of the 21st century evidence emerged of olmec writing with the earliest examples of olmec hieroglyphs dating to around 650 bc examples of script have been found on roller stamps and stone artefacts the texts are short and have been partially deciphered based on their similarity to other mesoamerican scripts the evidence of complex society developing in the olmec heartland has led to the olmecs being regarded as the mother culture of mesoamerica although this concept remains controversial
some of the olmecs'rulers seem to have served religious functions the city of san lorenzo was succeeded as the main centre of the civilization by la venta in about 900 bc with tres zapotes and laguna de los cerros possibly sharing the role other urban centres were much less significant the nature and degree of the control exercised by the centres over a widespread rural population remains unclear very fine olmec art much clearly made for an elite survives in several forms notably olmec figurines and larger sculptures such as the wrestler the figurines have been recovered in large numbers and are mostly in pottery these were presumably widely available to the population together with these of particular relevance to the colossal heads are the olmec-style masks in stone so called because none have yet been excavated in circumstances that allow the proper archaeological identification of an olmec context these evocative stone face masks present both similarities and differences to the colossal heads two thirds of olmec monumental sculpture represents the human form and the colossal heads fall within this major theme of olmec art
the colossal heads cannot be precisely dated however the san lorenzo heads were buried by 900 bc indicating that their period of manufacture and use was earlier still the heads from tres zapotes had been moved from their original context before they were investigated by archaeologists and the heads from la venta were found partially exposed on the modern ground surface the period of production of the colossal heads is therefore unknown as is whether it spanned a century or a millennium estimates of the time span during which colossal heads were produced vary from 50 to 200 years the san lorenzo heads are believed to be the oldest and are the most skillfully executed all of the stone heads have been assigned to the preclassic period of mesoamerican chronology generally to the early preclassic 1500–1000 bc although the two tres zapotes heads and the la cobata head are attributed to the middle preclassic 1000–400 bc
olmec colossal heads vary in height from 1.47 to 3.4 metres 4.8 to 11.2 ft and weigh between 6 and 50 tons all of the olmec colossal heads depict mature men with flat noses and fleshy cheeks the eyes tend to be slightly crossed the general physical characteristics of the heads are of a type that is still common among people in the olmec region in modern times the backs of the heads are often flat as if the monuments were originally placed against a wall all examples of olmec colossal heads wear distinctive headdresses that probably represent cloth or animal hide originals some examples have a tied knot at the back of the head and some are decorated with feathers a head from la venta is decorated with the head of a bird there are similarities between the headdresses on some of the heads that has led to speculation that specific headdresses may represent different dynasties or perhaps identify specific rulers most of the heads wear large earspools inserted into the ear lobes
all of the heads are realistic unidealised and frank descriptions of the men it is likely that they were portraits of living or recently deceased rulers well known to the sculptors each head is distinct and naturalistic displaying individualised features they were once thought to represent ballplayers although this theory is no longer widely held it is possible however that they represent rulers equipped for the mesoamerican ballgame facial expressions depicted on the heads vary from stern through placid to smiling the most naturalistic olmec art is the earliest appearing suddenly without surviving antecedents with a tendency towards more stylised sculpture as time progressed some surviving examples of wooden sculpture recovered from el manatí demonstrate that the olmecs are likely to have created many more perishable sculptures than works sculpted from stone
in the late nineteenth century josé melgar y serrano described a colossal head as having ethiopian features and speculations that the olmec had african origins resurfaced in 1960 in the work of alfonso medellín zenil and in the 1970s in the writings of ivan van sertima such speculation is not taken seriously by mesoamerican scholars such as richard diehl and ann cyphers
although all the colossal heads are broadly similar there are distinct stylistic differences in their execution one of the heads from san lorenzo bears traces of plaster and red paint suggesting that the heads were originally brightly decorated heads did not just represent individual olmec rulers they also incorporated the very concept of rulership itself
the production of each colossal head must have been carefully planned given the effort required to ensure the necessary resources were available it seems likely that only the more powerful olmec rulers were able to mobilise such resources the workforce would have included sculptors labourers overseers boatmen woodworkers and other artesans producing the tools to make and move the monument in addition to the support needed to feed and otherwise attend to these workers the seasonal and agricultural cycles and river levels needed to have been taken into account to plan the production of the monument and the whole project may well have taken years from beginning to end
archaeological investigation of olmec basalt workshops suggest that the colossal heads were first roughly shaped using direct percussion to chip away both large and small flakes of stone the sculpture was then refined by retouching the surface using hammerstones which were generally rounded cobbles that could be of the same basalt as the monument itself although this was not always the case abrasives were found in association with workshops at san lorenzo indicating their use in the finishing of fine detail olmec colossal heads were fashioned as in-the-round monuments with varying levels of relief on the same work they tended to feature higher relief on the face and lower relief on the earspools and headdresses monument 20 at san lorenzo is an extensively damaged throne with a figure emerging from a niche its sides were broken away and it was dragged to another location before being abandoned it is possible that this damage was caused by the initial stages of re-carving the monument into a colossal head but that the work was never completed
all seventeen of the confirmed heads in the olmec heartland were sculpted from basalt mined in the sierra de los tuxtlas mountains of veracruz most were formed from coarse grained dark grey basalt known as cerro cintepec basalt after a volcano in the range investigators have proposed that large cerro cintepec basalt boulders found on the southeastern slopes of the mountains are the source of the stone for the monuments these boulders are found in an area affected by large lahars volcanic mudslides that carried substantial blocks of stone down the mountain slopes which suggests that the olmecs did not need to quarry the raw material for sculpting the heads roughly spherical boulders were carefully selected to mimic the shape of a human head the stone for the san lorenzo and la venta heads was transported a considerable distance from the source the la cobata head was found on el vigia hill in the sierra de los tuxtlas and the stone from tres zapotes colossal head 1 and nestepe colossal head 1 also known as tres zapotes monuments a and q came from the same hill
the boulders were transported over 150 kilometres 93 mi from the source of the stone the exact method of transportation of such large masses of rock are unknown especially since the olmecs lacked beasts of burden and functional wheels and they were likely to have used water transport whenever possible coastal currents of the gulf of mexico and in river estuaries might have made the waterborne transport of monuments weighing 20 tons or more impractical two badly damaged olmec sculptures depict rectangular stone blocks bound with ropes a largely destroyed human figure rides upon each block with their legs hanging over the side these sculptures may well depict olmec rulers overseeing the transport of the stone that would be fashioned into their monuments when transport over land was necessary the olmecs are likely to have used causeways ramps and roads to facilitate moving the heads the regional terrain offers significant obstacles such as swamps and floodplains avoiding these would have necessitated crossing undulating hill country the construction of temporary causeways using the suitable and plentiful floodplain soils would have allowed a direct route across the floodplains to the san lorenzo plateau earth structures such as mounds platforms and causeways upon the plateau demonstrate that the olmec possessed the necessary knowledge and could commit the resources to build large-scale earthworks
the flat backs of many of the colossal heads represented the flat bases of the monumental thrones from which they were reworked only four of the seventeen heartland heads do not have flattened backs indicating the possibility that the majority were reworked monuments alternatively the backs of many of these massive monuments may have been flattened to ease their transport providing a stable form for hauling the monuments with ropes two heads from san lorenzo have traces of niches that are characteristic of monumental olmec thrones and so were definitely reworked from earlier monuments
seventeen confirmed examples are known an additional monument at takalik abaj in guatemala is a throne that may have been carved from a colossal head this is the only known example outside of the olmec heartland on the gulf coast of mexico possible fragments of additional colossal heads have been recovered at san lorenzo and at san fernando in tabasco crude colossal stone heads are also known in the southern maya area where they are associated with the potbelly style of sculpture although some arguments have been made that they are pre-olmec these latter monuments are generally believed to be influenced by the olmec style of sculpture
the ten colossal heads from san lorenzo originally formed two roughly parallel lines running north-south across the site although some were recovered from ravines they were found close to their original placements and had been buried by local erosion these heads together with a number of monumental stone thrones probably formed a processional route across the site powerfully displaying its dynastic history two of the san lorenzo heads had been re-carved from older thrones
san lorenzo colossal head 1 also known as san lorenzo monument 1 was lying facing upwards when excavated the erosion of a path passing on top of the monument uncovered its eye and led to the discovery of the olmec site colossal head 1 is 2.84 metres 9.3 ft high it measures 2.11 metres 6.9 ft wide and it weighs 25.3 tons the monument was discovered partially buried at the edge of a gully by matthew stirling in 1945 when discovered it was lying on its back looking upwards it was associated with a large number of broken ceramic vessels and figurines the majority of these ceramic remains have been dated to between 800 and 400 bc some pieces have been dated to the villa alta phase late classic period 800–1000 ad the headdress possesses a plain band that is tied at the back of the head the upper portion of the headdress is decorated with a u-shaped motif this element descends across the front of the headdress terminating on the forehead on the front portion it is decorated with five semicircular motifs the scalp piece does not meet the horizontal band leaving a space between the two pieces on each side of the face a strap descends from the headdress and passes in front of the ear the forehead is wrinkled in a frown the lips are slightly parted without revealing the teeth the cheeks are pronounced and the ears are particularly well executed the face is slightly asymmetric which may be due to error on the part of the sculptors or may accurately reflect the physical features of the portrait's subject the head has been moved to the museo de antropología de xalapa anthropological museum of xalapa

three of the la venta heads were found in a line running east-west in the northern complex i all three faced northwards away from the city centre the other head was found in complex b to the south of the great pyramid in a plaza that included a number of other sculptures the latter the first of the la venta heads to be discovered was found during archaeological exploration of la venta in 1925 the other three remained unknown to archaeologists until a local boy guided matthew stirling to them while he was excavating the first head in 1940 they were located approximately 0.9 kilometres 0.56 mi to the north of monument 1
la venta monument 1 is speculated to have been the portrait of la venta's final ruler monument 1 measures 2.41 metres 7.9 ft high by 2.08 metres 6.8 ft wide by 1.95 metres 6.4 ft deep it weighs 24 tons the front of the headdress is decorated with three motifs that apparently represent the claws or fangs of an animal above these symbols is an angular u-shaped decoration descending from the scalp on each side of the monument a strap descends from the headdress passing in front of the ear each ear has a prominent ear ornament that descends from the earlobe to the base of the monument the features are those of a mature man with wrinkles around the mouth eyes and nose monument 1 is the best preserved head at la venta but has suffered from erosion particularly at the back the head was first described by franz blom and oliver la farge who investigated the la venta remains on behalf of tulane university in 1925 when discovered it was half-buried its massive size meant that the discoverers were unable to excavate it completely matthew stirling fully excavated the monument in 1940 after clearing the thick vegetation that had covered it in the intervening years monument 1 has been moved to the parque-museo la venta in villahermosa the head was found in its original context associated finds have been radiocarbon dated to between 1000 and 600 bc
la venta monument 2 measures 1.63 metres 5.3 ft high by 1.35 metres 4.4 ft wide by 0.98 metres 3.2 ft deep the head weighs 11.8 tons the face has a broadly smiling expression that reveals four of the upper teeth the cheeks are given prominence by the action of smiling the brow that is normally visible in other heads is covered by the rim of the headdress the face is badly eroded distorting the features in addition to the severe erosion damage the upper lip and a part of the nose have been deliberately mutilated the head was found in its original context a few metres north of the northwest corner of pyramid-platform a-2 radiocarbon dating of the monument's context dates it to between 1000 and 600 bc monument 2 has suffered erosion damage from its exposure to the elements prior to discovery the head has a prominent headdress but this is badly eroded and any individual detail has been erased a strap descends in front of the ear on each side of the head descending as far as the earlobe the head is adorned with ear ornaments in the form of a disc that covers the earlobe with an associated clip or peg the surviving details of the headdress and earflares are stylistically similar to those of tres zapotes monument a. the head has been moved to the museo del estado de tabasco in villahermosa
la venta monument 3 stands 1.98 metres 6.5 ft high and measures 1.6 metres 5.2 ft wide by 1 metre 3.3 ft deep it weighs 12.8 tons monument 3 was located a few metres to the east of monument 2 but was moved to the parque-museo la venta in villahermosa like the other la venta heads its context has been radiocarbon dated to between 1000 and 600 bc it appears unfinished and has suffered severe damage through weathering making analysis difficult it had a large headdress that reaches to the eyebrows but any details have been lost through erosion straps descend in front of each ear and continue to the base of the monument the ears are wearing large flattened rings that overlap the straps they probably represent jade ornaments of a type that have been recovered in the olmec region although most of the facial detail is lost the crinkling of the bridge of the nose is still evident a feature that is common to the frowning expressions of the other olmec colossal heads
la venta monument 4 measures 2.26 metres 7.4 ft high by 1.98 metres 6.5 ft wide and 1.86 metres 6.1 ft deep it weighs 19.8 tons it was found a few metres to the west of monument 2 and has been moved to the parque-museo la venta as with the other heads in the group its archaeological context has been radiocarbon dated to between 1000 and 600 bc the headdress is elaborate and although damaged various details are still discernible the base of the headdress is formed by three horizontal strips running over the forehead one side is decorated with a double-disc motif that may have been repeated on the other if so damage to the right side has obliterated any trace of it the top of the headdress is decorated with the clawed foot of a bird of prey either straps or plaits of hair descend on either side of the face from the headdress to the base of the monument only one earspool survives it is flat in the form of a rounded square and is decorated with a cross motif the ears have been completely eroded away and the lips are damaged the surviving features display a frown and creasing around the nose and cheeks the head displays prominent teeth
the two heads at tres zapotes with the la cobata head are stylistically distinct from the other known examples beatriz de la fuente views them as a late regional survival of an older tradition while other scholars argue that they are merely the kind of regional variant to be expected in a frontier settlement these heads are sculpted with relatively simple headdresses they have squat wide proportions and distinctive facial features the two tres zapotes heads are the earliest known stone monuments from the site the discovery of one of the tres zapotes heads in the nineteenth century led to the first archaeological investigations of olmec culture carried out by matthew stirling in 1938
tres zapotes monument a also known as tres zapotes colossal head 1 was the first colossal head to be found discovered by accident in the middle of the nineteenth century 1 kilometre 0.62 mi to the north of the modern village of tres zapotes after its discovery it remained half-buried until it was excavated by matthew stirling in 1939 at some point it was moved to the plaza of the modern village probably in the early 1960s it has since been moved to the museo comunitario de tres zapotes monument a stands 1.47 metres 4.8 ft tall it measures 1.5 metres 4.9 ft wide by 1.45 metres 4.8 ft deep and is estimated to weigh 7.8 tons the head is sculpted with a simple headdress with a wide band that is otherwise unadorned and wears rectangular ear ornaments that project forwards onto the cheeks the face is carved with deep creases between the cheeks and the nose and around the mouth the forehead is creased into a frown the upper lip has suffered recent damage with the left portion flaking away
tres zapotes monument q also known as the nestape head and tres zapotes colossal head 2 measures 1.45 metres 4.8 ft high by 1.34 metres 4.4 ft wide by 1.26 metres 4.1 ft deep and weighs 8.5 tons its exact date of discovery is unknown but is estimated to have been some time in the 1940s when it was struck by machinery being used to clear vegetation from nestape hill monument q was the eleventh colossal head to be discovered it was moved to the plaza of santiago tuxtla in 1951 and remains there to this day monument q was first described by williams and heizer in an article published in 1965 the headdress is decorated with a frontal tongue-shaped ornament and the back of the head is sculpted with seven plaits of hair bound with tassels a strap descends from each side of the headdress passing over the ears and to the base of the monument the face has pronounced creases around the nose mouth and eyes
the la cobata region was the source of the basalt used for carving all of the colossal heads in the olmec heartland the la cobata colossal head was discovered in 1970 and was the fifteenth to be recorded it was discovered in a mountain pass in the sierra de los tuxtlas on the north side of el vigia volcano near to santiago tuxtla the head was largely buried when found excavations uncovered a late classic 600–900 ad offering associated with the head consisting of a ceramic vessel and a 12-centimetre 4.7 in long obsidian knife placed pointing northwards towards the head the offering is believed to have been deposited long after the head was sculpted the la cobata head has been moved from its original location to the main plaza at santiago
the la cobata head is more or less rounded and measures 3 by 3 metres 9.8 by 9.8 ft by 3.4 metres 11 ft high making it the largest known head this massive sculpture is estimated to weigh 40 tons it is stylistically distinct from the other examples and beatriz de la fuente placed it late in the olmec time frame the characteristics of the sculpture have led to some investigators suggesting that it represents a deceased person norman hammond argues that the apparent stylistic differences of the monument stem from its unfinished state rather than its late production the eyes of the monument are closed the nose is flattened and lacks nostrils and the mouth was not sculpted in a realistic manner the headdress is in the form of a plain horizontal band
the original location of the la cobata head was not a major archaeological site and it is likely that the head was either abandoned at its source or during transport to its intended destination various features of the head suggest that it was unfinished such as a lack of symmetry below the mouth and an area of rough stone above the base rock was not removed from around the earspools as on other heads and does not narrow towards the base large parts of the monument seem to be roughed out without finished detail the right hand earspool also appears incomplete the forward portion is marked with a sculpted line while the rear portion has been sculpted in relief probably indicating that the right cheek and eye area were also unfinished the la cobata head was almost certainly carved from a raw boulder rather than being sculpted from a throne
takalik abaj monument 23 dates to the middle preclassic period and is found in takalik abaj an important city in the foothills of the guatemalan pacific coast in the modern department of retalhuleu it appears to be an olmec-style colossal head re-carved into a niche figure sculpture if originally a colossal head then it would be the only known example from outside the olmec heartland
monument 23 is sculpted from andesite and falls in the middle of the size range for confirmed colossal heads it stands 1.84 metres 6.0 ft high and measures 1.2 metres 3.9 ft wide by 1.56 metres 5.1 ft deep like the examples from the olmec heartland the monument features a flat back lee parsons contests john graham's identification of monument 23 as a re-carved colossal head he views the side ornaments identified by graham as ears as rather the scrolled eyes of an open-jawed monster gazing upwards countering this james porter has claimed that the re-carving of the face of a colossal head into a niche figure is clearly evident
monument 23 was damaged in the mid-twentieth century by a local mason who attempted to break its exposed upper portion using a steel chisel as a result the top is fragmented although the broken pieces were recovered by archaeologists and have been put back into place
all of the 17 confirmed colossal heads remain in mexico two heads from san lorenzo are on permanent display at the museo nacional de antropología in mexico city seven of the san lorenzo heads are on display in the museo de antropología de xalapa five of them are in sala 1 one is in sala 2 and one is in patio 1 the remaining san lorenzo head is in the museo comunitario de san lorenzo tenochtitlán near texistepec all four heads from la venta are now in villahermosa the state capital of tabasco three are in the parque-museo la venta and one in the museo del estado de tabasco two heads are on display in the plaza of santiago tuxtla one from tres zapotes and the la cobata head the other tres zapotes head is in the museo comunitario de tres zapotes

according to stevens in one of his first games as head coach he was nervous and felt like our team played on edge because of it he decided that a team's play will reflect the mood of its coach a calm coach means a team that will remain poised in difficult game situations while a nervous coach means a team that plays on edge i don ’ t want to lose a game because of my approach he told himself accordingly he developed a strategy of always remaining calm and focused during games he rarely raises his voice or gets emotional instead quietly observing on the sideline with folded arms he does not get upset about bad calls by referees or player mistakes preferring to focus on the next play rather than what just happened butler player willie veasley explained butler's 2010 final four run by saying when those big runs by syracuse and kansas state came coach called a timeout and said a few calm words then he said he believes in us he loves us and we 're going to win the game on the rare occasion stevens feels the need to correct a player he does it with positive reinforcement just at a little louder decibel according to former assistant coach matthew graves above all stevens wants his players to be confident not living in fear of being yanked for making a bad play

stevens spends a lot of time preparing for each game and always tries to add a few new wrinkles specific to that game's opponent sports illustrated calls stevens an expert on breaking down tape and looking at statistical trends to find opponents'weaknesses former player ronald nored agrees we know everything we need to about our opponents all their tendencies are broken down ahead of time
stevens is a proponent of using statistical analysis to enhance his coaching decisions spending almost as much time looking at statistics as watching game film i think it's a unique way of looking at the game that may be able to help best communicate to your players he explains for example when butler was slumping in late 2010 stevens challenged his team this 46 defensive field goal percentage is where we are this isn 't acceptable to get to where we want to go but what does that really mean it's not just get better defensively it is if we give up 3 less baskets a game then we will be at 40 percent field goal percentage defense which will be top 20 in the country the team got the message improved throughout the season and ultimately went on a march run fueled by defense in 2012 stevens became the first college coach to hire someone solely for statistical research when he added drew cannon to the staff if he had the resources stevens says he would hire a team of statisticians to analyze the teams play
stevens'teams are built around solid basketball fundamentals and good team work rather than individual basketball skill his teams are known for their defense forcing opponents into uncharacteristic mistakes the secret to basketball–and life–is just to do the job to the best of your ability and don 't worry about anything else stevens says win the next game win the next possession that's our focus it's boring it's also the way championships are won he says in short stevens is a strong believer in the butler way "–doing all the little things that transform a group of good basketball players into a great basketball team i tell the players'the butler way'isn 't easy to define stevens says but you can see it on the floor when we share the basketball play with great energy and defend
stevens prefers to recruit strong team players instead of going after top recruits the guys we have recruited most of them weren 't very highly ranked stevens says they had very good high school careers or careers at other places transfers but for one reason or the other they weren 't seen as great players but they all had intangibles stevens puts a strong emphasis on education and has said he would only recruit a one and done player if he was committed to getting his degree while playing professionally
stevens has often been referred to as a coaching prodigy but is not interested in self-promotion he instead prefers to deflect the praise he receives to the players athletic department and his mentors he has not been known to posture for more money or to leak his name for open coaching positions he has been described as humble modest and not about the money
the new york times usa today espn and other commentators have attributed butler's success against teams with superior athletes to stevens'coaching style the times remarks the bulldogs are very well prepared for their opponents and they do not rattle easily and says that the resulting confidence has led to the team's success he coaches to his personality and to his strengths collier says obviously he has great rapport and communication ability with his team yahoo sports compared stevens to legendary coach john wooden writing brad stevens is winning at butler the wooden way–calm and composed on the sideline wooden agreed saying i enjoy watching stevens and very much enjoy butler's style of play
brad stevens is known for his youthful looks often being described as baby-faced one commentator remarked stevens looks like he checks the mirror every morning to see if it's time to start shaving on occasion he has been mistaken for a player he is also known for projecting a professional corporate look from the sidelines asked what his life would be like if he had never taken up coaching he replies if everything else remained the same i would have been as happy as heck ... friends and family and faith they 're going to take the cake over all this stuff stevens met his wife tracy née wilhelmy while attending depauw university tracy who played soccer for depauw quickly learned of brad's love for basketball on their third date he drove her an hour and a half to attend a high school basketball game tracy graduated from rocky river high school in 1995 and from depauw in 1999 she returned to school in 2000 driving five hours from case western's law school to indianapolis on weekends to see brad she finished her final year of law school in indianapolis and the couple married in august 2003 tracy works as a labor and employment lawyer tracy also serves as brad's agent
brad and tracy stevens are involved with the american cancer society's coaches vs cancer brad says that the cause really hit home for them after tracy's mother died of the disease in june 2004 the day before butler's 2010 final four appearance they hosted a fundraiser for the organization brad stevens has also volunteered his time to the jukes foundation for kids a charity benefiting ugandan children run by former butler player avery jukes stevens remains in close touch with the butler basketball family he notably took a one-game leave from the celtics in january 2016 to visit with andrew smith a player on both of butler's final four teams who was dying of cancer smith died less than a week later at the request of andrew's widow sam brad delivered the eulogy at the memorial service on january 17 2016

shackleton is an impact crater that lies at the south pole of the moon the peaks along the crater's rim are exposed to almost continual sunlight while the interior is perpetually in shadow a crater of eternal darkness the low-temperature interior of this crater functions as a cold trap that may capture and freeze volatiles shed during comet impacts on the moon measurements by the lunar prospector spacecraft showed higher than normal amounts of hydrogen within the crater which may indicate the presence of water ice the crater is named after antarctic explorer ernest shackleton
the rotational axis of the moon lies within shackleton only a few kilometers from its center the crater is 21 km in diameter and 4.2 km deep from the earth it is viewed edge-on in a region of rough cratered terrain it is located within the south pole-aitken basin on a massif the rim is slightly raised about the surrounding surface and it has an outer rampart that has been only lightly impacted no significant craters intersect the rim and it is sloped about 1.5 ° toward the direction 50–90 ° from the earth the age of the crater is about 3.6 billion years and it has been in the proximity of the south lunar pole for at least the last two billion years
because the orbit of the moon is tilted only 5 ° from the ecliptic the interior of this crater lies in perpetual darkness estimates of the area in permanent shadow were obtained from earth-based radar studies peaks along the rim of the crater are almost continually illuminated by sunlight spending about 80–90 of each lunar orbit exposed to the sun continuously illuminated mountains have been termed peaks of eternal light and have been predicted to exist since the 1900s
the shadowed portion of the crater was imaged with the terrain camera of the japanese selene spacecraft using the illumination of sunlight reflected off the rim the interior of the crater consists of a symmetrical 30 ° slope that leads down to a 6.6 km diameter floor the handful of craters along the interior span no more than a few hundred meters the bottom is covered by an uneven mound-like feature that is 300 to 400 m thick the central peak is about 200 m in height
the continuous shadows in the south polar craters cause the floors of these formations to maintain a temperature that never exceeds about 100 k. for shackleton the average temperature was determined to be about 90 k reaching 88 k at the crater floor under these conditions the estimated rate of loss from any ice in the interior would be 10 − 26 to 10 − 27 m s any water vapor that arrives here following a cometary impact on the moon would lie permanently frozen on or below the surface however the surface albedo of the crater floor matches the lunar far-side suggesting that there is no exposed surface ice
this crater was named after ernest henry shackleton an anglo-irish explorer of antarctica from 1901 until his death in 1922 the name was officially adopted by the international astronomical union in 1994 nearby craters of note include shoemaker haworth de gerlache sverdrup and faustini somewhat farther away on the eastern hemisphere of the lunar near side are the larger craters amundsen and scott named after two other early explorers of the antarctic continent
from the perspective of the earth this crater lies along the southern limb of the moon making observation difficult detailed mapping of the polar regions and farside of the moon did not occur until the advent of orbiting spacecraft shackleton lies entirely within the rim of the immense south pole-aitken basin which is one of the largest known impact formations in the solar system this basin is over 12 kilometers deep and an exploration of its properties could provide useful information about the lunar interior
a neutron spectrometer on board the lunar prospector spacecraft detected enhanced concentrations of hydrogen close to the northern and southern lunar poles including the crater shackleton at the end of this mission in july 1999 the spacecraft was crashed into the nearby crater shoemaker in the hope of detecting from earth-based telescopes an impact-generated plume containing water vapor the impact event did not produce any detectable water vapor and this may be an indication that the hydrogen is not in the form of hydrated minerals or that the impact site did not contain any ice alternatively it is possible that the crash did not excavate deeply enough into the regolith to liberate significant quantities of water vapor
from earth-based radar and spacecraft images of the crater edge shackleton appears to be relatively intact much like a young crater that has not been significantly eroded from subsequent impacts this may mean that the inner sides are relatively steep which may make traversing the sides relatively difficult for a robotic vehicle in addition it is possible that the interior floor might not have collected a significant quantity of volatiles since its formation however other craters in the vicinity are considerably older and may contain significant deposits of hydrogen possibly in the form of water ice see shoemaker lunar crater for example
radar studies preceding and following the lunar prospector mission demonstrate that the inner walls of shackleton are similar in reflective characteristics to those of some sunlit craters in particular the surroundings appear to contain a significant number of blocks in its ejecta blanket suggesting that its radar properties are a result of surface roughness and not ice deposits as was previously suggested from a radar experiment involving the clementine mission this interpretation however is not universally agreed upon within the scientific community radar images of the crater at a wavelength of 13 cm show no evidence for water ice deposits
optical imaging inside the crater was done for the first time by the japanese lunar orbiter spacecraft kaguya in 2007 it did not have any evidence of significant amount of water ice down to the image resolution of 10 m per pixel
on november 15 2008 a 34-kg probe made a hard landing near the crater the moon impact probe mip was launched from the indian chandrayaan-i spacecraft and reached the surface 25 minutes later the probe carried a radar altimeter video imaging system and a mass spectrometer which will be used to search for water
some sites along shackleton's rim receive almost constant illumination at these locales sunlight is almost always available for conversion into electricity using solar panels potentially making them good locations for future moon landings the temperature at this site is also more favorable than at more equatorial latitudes as it does not experience the daily temperature extremes of 100 ° c when the sun is overhead to as low as − 150 ° c during the lunar night
while scientific experiments performed by clementine and lunar prospector could indicate the presence of water in the polar craters the current evidence is far from definitive there are doubts among scientists as to whether or not the hydrogen is in the form of ice as well as to the concentration of this ore with depth below the surface resolution of this issue will require future missions to the moon the presence of water suggests that the crater floor could potentially be mined for deposits of hydrogen in water form a commodity that is expensive to deliver directly from the earth
this crater has also been proposed as a future site for a large infrared telescope the low temperature of the crater floor makes it ideal for infrared observations and solar cells placed along the rim could provide near-continuous power to the observatory about 120 kilometers from the crater lies the 5-km tall malapert mountain a peak that is perpetually visible from the earth and which could serve as a radio relay station when suitably equipped
nasa has named the rim of shackleton as a potential candidate for its lunar outpost slated to be up and running by 2020 and continuously staffed by a crew by 2024 the location would promote self-sustainability for lunar residents as perpetual sunlight on the south pole would provide energy for solar panels furthermore the shadowed polar regions are believed to contain the frozen water necessary for human consumption and could also be harvested for fuel manufacture
american beauty is a 1999 american drama film directed by sam mendes and written by alan ball kevin spacey stars as lester burnham a 42-year-old advertising executive who has a midlife crisis when he becomes infatuated with his teenaged daughter's best friend angela mena suvari annette bening co-stars as lester's materialistic wife carolyn and thora birch plays their insecure daughter jane wes bentley chris cooper and allison janney also feature the film is described by academics as a satire of american middle-class notions of beauty and personal satisfaction analysis has focused on the film's explorations of romantic and paternal love sexuality beauty materialism self-liberation and redemption
ball began writing american beauty as a play in the early 1990s partly inspired by the media circus around the amy fisher trial in 1992 he shelved the play after realizing the story would not work on stage after several years as a television screenwriter ball revived the idea in 1997 when attempting to break into the film industry the modified script had a cynical outlook that was influenced by ball's frustrating tenures writing for several sitcoms producers dan jinks and bruce cohen took american beauty to dreamworks the then-fledgling film studio bought ball's script for 250,000 outbidding several other production bodies dreamworks financed the 15 million production and served as its north american distributor american beauty marked acclaimed theater director mendes'film debut courted after his successful productions of the musicals oliver and cabaret mendes was nevertheless only given the job after 20 others were considered and several a-list directors turned down the opportunity
spacey was mendes'first choice for the role of lester though dreamworks had urged the director to consider better-known actors similarly the studio suggested several actors for the role of carolyn until mendes offered the part to bening without dreamworks'knowledge principal photography took place between december 1998 and february 1999 on soundstages at the warner bros. backlot in burbank california and on location in los angeles mendes'dominant style was deliberate and composed he made extensive use of static shots and slow pans and zooms to generate tension cinematographer conrad hall complemented mendes'style with peaceful shot compositions to contrast with the turbulent on-screen events during editing mendes made several changes that gave the film a less cynical tone than the script
released in north america on september 17 1999 american beauty was positively received by critics and audiences it was the best-reviewed american film of the year and grossed over 356 million worldwide reviewers praised most aspects of the production with particular emphasis on mendes spacey and ball criticism focused on the familiarity of the characters and setting dreamworks launched a major campaign to increase the film's chances of academy award success at the 72nd academy awards the following year the film won best picture best director best actor for spacey best original screenplay and best cinematography it was nominated for and won many other awards and honors mainly for the direction writing and acting
lester burnham is a middle-aged advertising executive and magazine writer who despises his job he is unhappily married to carolyn a neurotic yet fiercely ambitious real estate broker their teenaged daughter jane abhors her parents and has low self-esteem the burnhams'new neighbors are retired united states marine corps colonel frank fitts and his near-catatonic wife barbara their teenaged son ricky constantly films his surroundings with a camcorder collecting hundreds of recordings on videotapes in his bedroom his job as a part-time bar caterer serves as a front for his secret marijuana dealing col. fitts is a strict disciplinarian who previously sent ricky to a military school and briefly committed him to a psychiatric hospital jim olmeyer and jim berkley a gay couple who live nearby welcome the family to the neighborhood the homophobic col. fitts angrily asks ricky why these faggots have to rub it in your face
lester becomes infatuated with jane's vain friend angela hayes after seeing her perform a half-time dance routine at a high school basketball game he starts having sexual fantasies about angela in which red rose petals are a recurring motif carolyn begins an affair with her married business rival buddy kane when lester's boss brad tells him that he is to be laid off lester instead blackmails him for 60,000 and quits his job lester takes a minimum-wage job at a fast-food restaurant trades in his toyota camry for his dream car a 1970 pontiac firebird and starts working out after he overhears angela tell jane that she would find him sexually attractive if he got in shape he begins smoking marijuana supplied by ricky the girls'friendship wanes after jane starts a relationship with ricky jane and ricky bond over what ricky considers the most beautiful imagery he has filmed a plastic bag being blown in the wind
lester discovers carolyn's infidelity but reacts indifferently buddy ends the affair fearing an expensive divorce col. fitts becomes suspicious of lester and ricky's friendship when he finds his son's footage of lester lifting weights while nude which ricky captured by chance leading him to believe that ricky is gay after spying on ricky and lester through lester's garage window the colonel mistakenly concludes the pair is sexually involved he later confronts and beats ricky for the supposed affair and accuses him of being gay ricky falsely admits the charges and goads his father into kicking him out of their home meanwhile carolyn is sitting in her car in the rain taking a gun out of the glove box while a voice on the radio talks about not being a victim ricky goes to jane's bedroom finding her arguing with angela about angela's flirtation with lester ricky convinces jane to flee with him to new york city and assures angela that she is ugly boring and ordinary
col. fitts confronts lester and attempts to kiss him lester rebuffs the colonel who tearfully flees carolyn puts the gun in her handbag shouting i refuse to be a victim lester finds a distraught angela sitting alone in the dark she asks him to tell her she is beautiful he does and they kiss
carolyn drives through the rain rehearsing a confession to lester just as lester and angela are about to have sex she admits that she is a virgin and lester changes his mind he instead comforts her and the pair bond over their shared frustrations angela goes to the bathroom and lester smiles at a family photograph in his kitchen an unseen figure raises a gun to the back of his head a gunshot sounds and blood sprays on the wall ricky and jane find lester's body while carolyn breaks down crying in the closet a bloodied col. fitts returns home where a gun is shown to be missing from his collection lester's closing narration describes meaningful experiences during his life he says that despite his death he is happy because there is so much beauty in the world
scholars and academics have offered many possible readings of american beauty film critics are similarly divided not so much about the quality of the film as their interpretations of it described by many as about the meaning of life or the hollow existence of the american suburbs the film has defied categorization by even the filmmakers mendes is indecisive saying the script seemed to be about something different each time he read it a mystery story a kaleidoscopic journey through american suburbia a series of love stories ... it was about imprisonment ... loneliness and beauty it was funny it was angry sad the literary critic and author wayne c. booth concludes that the film resists any one interpretation american beauty cannot be adequately summarized as'here is a satire on what's wrong with american life'; that plays down the celebration of beauty it is more tempting to summarize it as'a portrait of the beauty underlying american miseries and misdeeds', but that plays down the scenes of cruelty and horror and ball's disgust with our mores it cannot be summarized with either lester or ricky's philosophical statements about what life is or how one should live he argues that the problem of interpreting the film is tied with that of finding its center — a controlling voice who unites all of the choices he contends that in american beauty's case it is neither mendes nor ball mendes considers the voice to be ball's but even while the writer was strongly influential on set he often had to accept deviations from his vision particularly ones that transformed the cynical tone of his script into something more optimistic with innumerable voices intruding on the original author's booth says those who interpret american beauty have forgotten to probe for the elusive center according to booth the film's true controller is the creative energy that hundreds of people put into its production agreeing and disagreeing inserting and cutting
mendes called american beauty a rite of passage film about imprisonment and escape from imprisonment the monotony of lester's existence is established through his gray nondescript workplace and characterless clothing in these scenes he is often framed as if trapped reiterating rituals that hardly please him he masturbates in the confines of his shower the shower stall evokes a jail cell and the shot is the first of many where lester is confined behind bars or within frames such as when he is reflected behind columns of numbers on a computer monitor confined and nearly crossed out the academic and author jody w. pennington argues that lester's journey is the story's center his sexual reawakening through meeting angela is the first of several turning points as he begins to throw off the responsibilities of the comfortable life he has come to despise after lester shares a joint with ricky his spirit is released and he begins to rebel against carolyn changed by ricky's attractive profound confidence lester is convinced that angela is attainable and sees that he must question his banal numbingly materialist suburban existence he takes a job at a fast-food outlet which allows him to regress to a point when he could see his whole life ahead of him
when lester is caught masturbating by carolyn his angry retort about their lack of intimacy is the first time he says aloud what he thinks about her by confronting the issue and carolyn's superficial investments in others lester is trying to regain a voice in a home that only respects the voices of mother and daughter his final turning point comes when angela and he almost have sex after she confesses her virginity he no longer thinks of her as a sex object but as a daughter he holds her close and wraps her up mendes called it the most satisfying end to lester's journey there could possibly have been with these final scenes mendes intended to show lester at the conclusion of a mythical quest after lester gets a beer from the refrigerator the camera pushes toward him then stops facing a hallway down which he walks to meet his fate having begun to act his age again lester achieves closure as he smiles at a family photo the camera pans slowly from lester to the kitchen wall onto which blood spatters as a gunshot rings out the slow pan reflects the peace of lester's death his body is discovered by jane and ricky mendes said that ricky's staring into lester's dead eyes is the culmination of the theme of the film that beauty is found where it is least expected
like other american films of 1999 — such as fight club bringing out the dead and magnolia american beauty instructs its audience to lead more meaningful lives the film argues the case against conformity but does not deny that people need and want it even the gay characters just want to fit in jim and jim the burnhams'other neighbors are a satire of gay bourgeois coupledom who invest in the numbing sameness that the film criticizes in heterosexual couples the feminist academic and author sally r. munt argues that american beauty uses its art house trappings to direct its message of nonconformity primarily to the middle classes and that this approach is a cliché of bourgeois preoccupation ... the underlying premise being that the luxury of finding an individual'self'through denial and renunciation is always open to those wealthy enough to choose and sly enough to present themselves sympathetically as a rebel
professor roy m. anker argues that the film's thematic center is its direction to the audience to look closer the opening combines an unfamiliar viewpoint of the burnhams'neighborhood with lester's narrated admission that he will soon die forcing audiences to consider their own mortality and the beauty around them it also sets a series of mysteries anker asks from what place exactly and from what state of being is he telling this story if he's already dead why bother with whatever it is he wishes to tell about his last year of being alive there is also the question of how lester has died — or will die anker believes the preceding scene — jane's discussion with ricky about the possibility of his killing her father — adds further mystery professor ann c. hall disagrees she says by presenting an early resolution to the mystery the film allows the audience to put it aside to view the film and its philosophical issues through this examination of lester's life rebirth and death american beauty satirizes american middle class notions of meaning beauty and satisfaction even lester's transformation only comes about because of the possibility of sex with angela he therefore remains a willing devotee of the popular media's exaltation of pubescent male sexuality as a sensible route to personal wholeness carolyn is similarly driven by conventional views of happiness from her belief in house beautiful domestic bliss to her car and gardening outfit carolyn's domain is a fetching american millennial vision of pleasantville or eden the burnhams are unaware that they are materialists philosophically and devout consumers ethically who expect the rudiments of american beauty to give them happiness anker argues that they are helpless in the face of the prettified economic and sexual stereotypes ... that they and their culture have designated for their salvation
the film presents ricky as its visionary ... spiritual and mystical center he sees beauty in the minutiae of everyday life videoing as much as he can for fear of missing it he shows jane what he considers the most beautiful thing he has filmed a plastic bag tossing in the wind in front of a wall he says capturing the moment was when he realized that there was an entire life behind things he feels that sometimes there's so much beauty in the world i feel like i can 't take it ... and my heart is going to cave in anker argues that ricky in looking past the cultural dross has grasped the radiant splendor of the created world to see god as the film progresses the burnhams move closer to ricky's view of the world lester only forswears personal satisfaction at the film's end on the cusp of having sex with angela he returns to himself after she admits her virginity suddenly confronted with a child he begins to treat her as a daughter in doing so lester sees himself angela and his family for the poor and fragile but wondrous creatures they are he looks at a picture of his family in happier times and dies having had an epiphany that infuses him with wonder joy and soul-shaking gratitude — he has finally seen the world as it is
according to patti bellantoni colors are used symbolically throughout the film none more so than red which is an important thematic signature that drives the story and defines lester's arc first seen in drab colors that reflect his passivity lester surrounds himself with red as he regains his individuality the american beauty rose is repeatedly used as symbol when lester fantasizes about angela she is usually naked and surrounded by rose petals in these scenes the rose symbolizes lester's desire for her when associated with carolyn the rose represents a façade for suburban success roses are included in almost every shot inside the burnhams'home where they signify a mask covering a bleak unbeautiful reality carolyn feels that as long as there can be roses all is well she cuts the roses and puts them in vases where they adorn her meretricious vision of what makes for beauty and begin to die the roses in the vase in the angela–lester seduction scene symbolize lester's previous life and carolyn the camera pushes in as lester and angela get closer finally taking the roses — and thus carolyn — out of the shot lester's epiphany at the end of the film is expressed by rain and the use of red building to a crescendo that is a deliberate contrast to the release lester feels the constant use of red lulls the audience subliminally into becoming used to it consequently it leaves the audience unprepared when lester is shot and his blood spatters on the wall
pennington argues that american beauty defines its characters through their sexuality lester's attempts to relive his youth are a direct result of his lust for angela and the state of his relationship with carolyn is in part shown through their lack of sexual contact also sexually frustrated carolyn has an affair that takes her from cold perfectionist to a more carefree soul who sings happily along with the music in her car jane and angela constantly reference sex through angela's descriptions of her supposed sexual encounters and the way the girls address each other their nude scenes are used to communicate their vulnerability by the end of the film angela's hold on jane has weakened until the only power she has over her friend is lester's attraction to her col. fitts reacts with disgust to meeting jim and jim he asks how come these faggots always have to rub it in your face how can they be so shameless to which ricky replies that's the thing dad — they don 't feel like it's anything to be ashamed of pennington argues that col. fitts'reaction is not homophobic but an anguished self-interrogation
with other turn-of-the-millennium films such as fight club in the company of men 1997 american psycho 2000 and boys don 't cry 1999 american beauty raises the broader widely explored issue of masculinity in crisis professor vincent hausmann charges that in their reinforcement of masculinity against threats posed by war by consumerism and by feminist and queer challenges these films present a need to focus on and even to privilege aspects of maleness deemed'deviant'" lester's transformation conveys that he and not the woman has borne the brunt of lack of being and he will not stand for being emasculated lester's attempts to strengthen traditional masculinity conflict with his responsibilities as a father although the film portrays the way lester returns to that role positively he does not become the hypermasculine figure implicitly celebrated in films like fight club hausmann concludes that lester's behavior toward angela is a misguided but nearly necessary step toward his becoming a father again
hausmann says the film explicitly affirms the importance of upholding the prohibition against incest a recurring theme of ball's work is his comparison of the taboos against incest and homosexuality instead of making an overt distinction american beauty looks at how their repression can lead to violence col. fitts is so ashamed of his homosexuality that it drives him to murder lester ball said the movie is in part about how homophobia is based in fear and repression and about what they can do the film implies two unfulfilled incestuous desires lester's pursuit of angela is a manifestation of his lust for his own daughter while col. fitts'repression is exhibited through the almost sexualized discipline with which he controls ricky consequently ricky realizes that he can only hurt his father by falsely telling him he is homosexual while angela's vulnerability and submission to lester reminds him of his responsibilities and the limits of his fantasy col. fitts represents ball's father whose repressed homosexual desires led to his own unhappiness ball rewrote col. fitts to delay revealing him as homosexual which munt reads as a possible deferment of ball's own patriarchal-incest fantasies
american beauty follows a traditional narrative structure only deviating with the displaced opening scene of jane and ricky from the middle of the story although the plot spans one year the film is narrated by lester at the moment of his death jacqueline furby says that the plot occupies ... no time or all time citing lester's claim that life did not flash before his eyes but that it stretches on forever like an ocean of time furby argues that a rhythm of repetition forms the core of the film's structure for example two scenes have the burnhams sitting down to an evening meal shot from the same angle each image is broadly similar with minor differences in object placement and body language that reflect the changed dynamic brought on by lester's new-found assertiveness another example is the pair of scenes in which jane and ricky film each other ricky films jane from his bedroom window as she removes her bra and the image is reversed later for a similarly voyeuristic and exhibitionist scene in which jane films ricky at a vulnerable moment
lester's fantasies are emphasized by slow- and repetitive-motion shots mendes uses double-and-triple cutbacks in several sequences and the score alters to make the audience aware that it is entering a fantasy one example is the gymnasium scene — lester's first encounter with angela while the cheerleaders perform their half-time routine to on broadway lester becomes increasingly fixated on angela time slows to represent his voyeuristic hypnosis and lester begins to fantasize that angela's performance is for him alone on broadway — which provides a conventional underscore to the onscreen action — is replaced by discordant percussive music that lacks melody or progression this nondiegetic score is important to creating the narrative stasis in the sequence it conveys a moment for lester that is stretched to an indeterminate length the effect is one that stan link likens to vertical time described by the composer and music theorist jonathan kramer as music that imparts a single present stretched out into an enormous duration a potentially infinite'now'that nonetheless feels like an instant the music is used like a visual cue so that lester and the score are staring at angela the sequence ends with the sudden reintroduction of on broadway and teleological time
according to drew miller of stylus the soundtrack gives unconscious voice to the characters'psyches and complements the subtext the most obvious use of pop music accompanies and gives context to lester's attempts to recapture his youth reminiscent of how the counterculture of the 1960s combated american repression through music and drugs lester begins to smoke cannabis and listen to rock music mendes'song choices progress through the history of american popular music miller argues that although some may be over familiar there is a parodic element at work making good on the film's encouragement that viewers look closer toward the end of the film thomas newman's score features more prominently creating a disturbing tempo that matches the tension of the visuals the exception is don 't let it bring you down which plays during angela's seduction of lester at first appropriate its tone clashes as the seduction stops the lyrics which speak of castles burning can be seen as a metaphor for lester's view of angela — the rosy fantasy-driven exterior of the'american beauty'" — as it burns away to reveal the timid small-breasted girl who like his wife has willfully developed a false public self
in 1997 alan ball resolved to move into the film industry after several frustrating years writing for the television sitcoms grace under fire and cybill he joined the united talent agency where his representative andrew cannava suggested he write a spec script to reintroduce himself to the town as a screenwriter ball pitched three ideas to cannava two conventional romantic comedies and american beauty which he had originally conceived as a play in the early 1990s despite the story's lack of an easily marketable concept cannava selected american beauty because he felt it was the one for which ball had the most passion while developing the script ball created another television sitcom oh grow up he channeled his anger and frustration at having to accede to network demands on that show — and during his tenures on grace under fire and cybill — into writing american beauty
ball did not expect to sell the script believing it would act as more of a calling card but american beauty drew interest from several production bodies cannava passed the script to several producers including dan jinks and bruce cohen who took it to dreamworks with the help of executives glenn williamson and bob cooper and steven spielberg in his capacity as studio partner ball was convinced to develop the project at dreamworks he received assurances from the studio — known at the time for its more conventional fare — that it would not iron the edges out in an unusual move dreamworks decided not to option the script instead in april 1998 the studio bought it outright for 250,000 outbidding fox searchlight pictures october films metro-goldwyn-mayer and lakeshore entertainment dreamworks planned to make the film for 6–8 million
jinks and cohen involved ball throughout the film's development including casting and director selection the producers met with about 20 interested directors several of whom were considered a-list at the time ball was not keen on the more well-known directors because he believed their involvement would increase the budget and lead dreamworks to become nervous about the content nevertheless the studio offered the film to mike nichols and robert zemeckis neither accepted in the same year mendes then a theater director revived the musical cabaret in new york with fellow director rob marshall beth swofford of the creative artists agency arranged meetings for mendes with studio figures in los angeles to see if film direction was a possibility mendes came across american beauty in a pile of eight scripts at swofford's house and knew immediately that it was the one he wanted to make early in his career he had been inspired by how the film paris texas 1984 presented contemporary america as a mythic landscape and he saw the same theme in american beauty as well as parallels with his own childhood mendes later met with spielberg impressed by mendes'productions of oliver and cabaret spielberg encouraged him to consider american beauty
mendes found that he still had to convince dreamworks'production executives to let him direct he had already discussed the film with jinks and cohen and felt they supported him ball was also keen having seen cabaret he was impressed with mendes'" keen visual sense and thought he did not make obvious choices ball felt that mendes liked to look under the story's surface a talent he felt would be a good fit with the themes of american beauty mendes'background also reassured him because of the prominent role the playwright usually has in a theater production over two meetings — the first with cooper walter parkes and laurie macdonald the second with cooper alone — mendes pitched himself to the studio the studio soon approached mendes with a deal to direct for the minimum salary allowed under directors guild of america rules — 150,000 mendes accepted and later recalled that after taxes and his agent's commission he only earned 38,000 in june 1998 dreamworks confirmed that it had contracted mendes to direct the film
ball was partly inspired by two encounters he had in the early 1990s in about 1991–92 ball saw a plastic bag blowing in the wind outside the world trade center he watched the bag for 10 minutes saying later that it provoked an unexpected emotional response in 1992 ball became preoccupied with the media circus around the amy fisher trial discovering a comic book telling of the scandal he was struck by how quickly it had become commercialized he said he felt like there was a real story underneath that was more fascinating and way more tragic than the story presented to the public and attempted to turn the idea into a play ball produced around 40 pages but stopped when he realized it would work better as a film he felt that because of the visual themes and because each character's story was .. intensely personal it could not be done on a stage all the main characters appeared in this version but carolyn did not feature strongly jim and jim instead had much larger roles
ball based lester's story on aspects of his own life lester's re-examination of his life parallels feelings ball had in his mid-30s like lester ball put aside his passions to work in jobs he hated for people he did not respect scenes in ricky's household reflect ball's own childhood experiences ball suspected his father was homosexual and used the idea to create col. fitts a man who gave up his chance to be himself ball said the script's mix of comedy and drama was not intentional but that it came unconsciously from his own outlook on life he said the juxtaposition produced a starker contrast giving each trait more impact than if they appeared alone
in the script that was sent to prospective actors and directors lester and angela had sex by the time of shooting ball had rewritten the scene to the final version ball initially rebuffed counsel from others that he change the script feeling they were being puritanical the final impetus to alter the scene came from dreamworks'then-president walter parkes he convinced ball by indicating that in greek mythology the hero has a moment of epiphany before ... tragedy occurs ball later said his anger when writing the first draft had blinded him to the idea that lester needed to refuse sex with angela to complete his emotional journey — to achieve redemption jinks and cohen asked ball not to alter the scene right away as they felt it would be inappropriate to make changes to the script before a director had been hired early drafts also included a flashback to col. fitts'service in the marines a sequence that unequivocally established his homosexual leanings in love with another marine col. fitts sees the man die and comes to believe that he is being punished for the sin of being gay ball removed the sequence because it did not fit the structure of the rest of the film — col. fitts was the only character to have a flashback — and because it removed the element of surprise from col. fitts'later pass at lester ball said he had to write it for his own benefit to know what happened to col. fitts though all that remained in later drafts was subtext
ball remained involved throughout production he had signed a television show development deal so had to get permission from his producers to take a year off to be close to american beauty ball was on-set for rewrites and to help interpret his script for all but two days of filming his original bookend scenes — in which ricky and jane are prosecuted for lester's murder after being framed by col. fitts — were excised in post-production the writer later felt the scenes were unnecessary saying they were a reflection of his anger and cynicism at the time of writing see editing ball and mendes revised the script twice before it was sent to the actors and twice more before the first read-through
the shooting script features a scene in angela's car in which ricky and jane talk about death and beauty the scene differed from earlier versions which set it as a big scene on a freeway in which the three witness a car crash and see a dead body the change was a practical decision as the production was behind schedule and they needed to cut costs the schedule called for two days to be spent filming the crash but only half a day was available ball agreed but only if the scene could retain a line of ricky's where he reflects on having once seen a dead homeless woman when you see something like that it's like god is looking right at you just for a second and if you 're careful you can look right back jane asks and what do you see ricky beauty ball said they wanted to cut that scene they said it's not important i said ,'you 're out of your fucking mind it's one of the most important scenes in the movie !'[ ... if any one line is the heart and soul of this movie that is the line another scene was rewritten to accommodate the loss of the freeway sequence set in a schoolyard it presents a turning point for jane in that she chooses to walk home with ricky instead of going with angela by the end of filming the script had been through 10 drafts
mendes had spacey and bening in mind for the leads from the beginning but dreamworks executives were unenthusiastic the studio suggested several alternatives including bruce willis kevin costner or john travolta to play lester and helen hunt or holly hunter to play carolyn mendes did not want a big star weighing the film down he felt spacey was the right choice based on his performances in the 1995 films the usual suspects and seven and 1992's glengarry glen ross spacey was surprised he said i usually play characters who are very quick very manipulative and smart ... i usually wade in dark sort of treacherous waters this is a man living one step at a time playing by his instincts this is actually much closer to me to what i am than those other parts mendes offered bening the role of carolyn without the studio's consent although executives were upset at mendes by september 1998 dreamworks had entered negotiations with spacey and bening
spacey loosely based lester's early schlubby deportment on walter matthau during the film lester's physique improves from flabby to toned spacey worked out during filming to improve his body but because mendes shot the scenes out of chronological order spacey varied postures to portray the stages before filming mendes and spacey analyzed jack lemmon's performance in the apartment 1960 because mendes wanted spacey to emulate the way lemmon moved the way he looked the way he was in that office and the way he was an ordinary man and yet a special man spacey's voiceover is a throwback to sunset boulevard 1950 which is also narrated in retrospect by a dead character mendes felt it evoked lester's — and the film's — loneliness bening recalled women from her youth to inform her performance i used to babysit constantly you 'd go to church and see how people present themselves on the outside and then be inside their house and see the difference bening and a hair stylist collaborated to create a pta president coif hairstyle and mendes and production designer naomi shohan researched mail-order catalogs to better establish carolyn's environment of a spotless suburban manor to help bening get into carolyn's mindset mendes gave her music that he believed carolyn would like he lent bening the bobby darin version of the song don 't rain on my parade which she enjoyed and persuaded the director to include it for a scene in which carolyn sings in her car
for the roles of jane ricky and angela dreamworks gave mendes carte blanche by november 1998 thora birch wes bentley and mena suvari had been cast in the parts — in birch's case despite the fact she was underage for her nude scene as birch was 16 at the time she made the film and thus classified as a minor in the united states her parents had to approve her brief topless scene in the movie child labor representatives and they were on the set for the shooting of the scene bentley overcame competition from top actors under the age of 25 to be cast the 2009 documentary my big break followed bentley and several other young actors before and after he landed the part to prepare mendes provided bentley with a video camera telling the actor to film what ricky would peter gallagher and alison janney were cast as buddy kane and barbara fitts after filming began in december 1998 mendes gave janney a book of paintings by edvard munch he told her your character is in there somewhere mendes cut much of barbara's dialogue including conversations between colonel fitts and her as he felt that what needed to be said about the pair — their humanity and vulnerability — was conveyed successfully through their shared moments of silence chris cooper plays colonel fitts scott bakula plays jim olmeyer and sam robards plays jim berkley jim and jim were deliberately depicted as the most normal happy — and boring — couple in the film ball's inspiration for the characters came from a thought he had after seeing a bland boring heterosexual couple who wore matching clothes i can 't wait for the time when a gay couple can be just as boring ball also included aspects of a gay couple he knew who had the same forename
mendes insisted on two weeks of cast rehearsals although the sessions were not as formal as he was used to in the theater and the actors could not be present at every one several improvisations and suggestions by the actors were incorporated into the script an early scene showing the burnhams leaving home for work was inserted later on to show the low point that carolyn and lester's relationship had reached spacey and bening worked to create a sense of the love that lester and carolyn once had for one another for example the scene in which lester almost seduces carolyn after the pair argues over lester's buying a car was originally strictly contentious
principal photography lasted about 50 days from december 14 1998 to february 1999 american beauty was filmed on soundstages at the warner bros. backlot in burbank california and at hancock park and brentwood in los angeles the aerial shots at the beginning and end of the film were captured in sacramento california and many of the school scenes were shot at south high school in torrance california several extras in the gym crowd were south high students the film is set in an upper middle-class neighborhood in an unidentified american town production designer naomi shohan likened the locale to evanston illinois but said it's not about a place it's about an archetype ... the milieu was pretty much anywhere usa — upwardly mobile suburbia the intent was for the setting to reflect the characters who are also archetypes shohan said all of them are very strained and their lives are constructs the burnhams'household was designed as the reverse of the fitts'— the former a pristine ideal but graceless and lacking in inner balance leading to carolyn's desire to at least give it the appearance of a perfect all-american household the fitts'home is depicted in exaggerated darkness and symmetry
the production selected two adjacent properties on the warner backlot's blondie street for the burnham and fitts'homes the crew rebuilt the houses to incorporate false rooms that established lines of sight — between ricky and jane's bedroom windows and between ricky's bedroom and lester's garage the garage windows were designed specifically to obtain the crucial shot toward the end of the film in which col. fitts — watching from ricky's bedroom — mistakenly assumes that lester is paying ricky for sex mendes made sure to establish the line of sight early on in the film to make the audience feel a sense of familiarity with the shot the house interiors were filmed on the backlot on location and on soundstages when overhead shots were needed the inside of the burnhams'home was shot at a house close to interstate 405 and sunset boulevard in los angeles the inside of the fitts'home was shot in the city's hancock park neighborhood ricky's bedroom was designed to be cell-like to suggest his monkish personality while at the same time blending with the high-tech equipment to reflect his voyeuristic side the production deliberately minimized the use of red as it was an important thematic signature elsewhere the burnhams'home uses cool blues while the fitts'is kept in a depressed military palette
mendes'dominating visual style was deliberate and composed with a minimalist design that provided a sparse almost surreal feeling — a bright crisp hard edged near magritte-like take on american suburbia mendes constantly directed his set dressers to empty the frame he made lester's fantasy scenes more fluid and graceful and mendes made minimal use of steadicams feeling that stable shots generated more tension for example when mendes used a slow push in to the burnhams'dinner table he held the shot because his training as a theater director taught him the importance of putting distance between the characters he wanted to keep the tension in the scene so he only cut away when jane left the table mendes did use a hand-held camera for the scene in which col. fitts beats ricky mendes said the camera provided the scene with a kinetic ... off-balance energy he also went hand-held for the excerpts of ricky's camcorder footage mendes took a long time to get the quality of ricky's footage to the level he wanted for the plastic-bag footage mendes used wind machines to move the bag in the air the scene took four takes two by the second unit did not satisfy mendes so he shot the scene himself he felt his first take lacked grace but for the last attempt he changed the location to the front of a brick wall and added leaves on the ground mendes was satisfied by the way the wall gave definition to the outline of the bag
mendes avoided using close-ups as he believed the technique was overused he also cited spielberg's advice that he should imagine an audience silhouetted at the bottom of the camera monitor to keep in mind that he was shooting for display on a 40-foot 10 m screen spielberg — who visited the set a few times — also advised mendes not to worry about costs if he had a great idea toward the end of a long working day mendes said that happened three or four times and they are all in the movie despite spielberg's support dreamworks and mendes fought constantly over the schedule and budget although the studio interfered little with the film's content spacey bening and hall worked for significantly less than their usual rates american beauty cost dreamworks 15 million to produce slightly above their projected sum mendes was so dissatisfied with his first three days'filming that he obtained permission from dreamworks to reshoot the scenes he said i started with a wrong scene actually a comedy scene and the actors played it way too big ... it was badly shot my fault badly composed my fault bad costumes my fault ... and everybody was doing what i was asking it was all my fault aware that he was a novice mendes drew on the experience of hall i made a very conscious decision early on if i didn 't understand something technically to say without embarrassment ,'i don 't understand what you 're talking about please explain it .'"
mendes encouraged some improvisation for example when lester masturbates in bed beside carolyn the director asked spacey to improvise several euphemisms for the act in each take mendes said i wanted that not just because it was funny ... but because i didn 't want it to seem rehearsed i wanted it to seem like he was blurting it out of his mouth without thinking spacey is so in control — i wanted him to break through spacey obliged eventually coming up with 35 phrases but bening could not always keep a straight face which meant the scene had to be shot 10 times the production used small amounts of computer-generated imagery most of the rose petals in lester's fantasies were added in post-production although some were real and had the wires holding them digitally removed when lester fantasizes about angela in a rose-petal bath the steam was real save for in the overhead shot to position the camera a hole had to be cut in the ceiling through which the steam escaped it was instead added digitally
american beauty was edited by christopher greenbury and tariq anwar greenbury began in the position but had to leave halfway through post-production because of a scheduling conflict with me myself and irene 2000 in which chris cooper also starred mendes and an assistant edited the film for 10 days between the appointments mendes realized during editing that the film was different from the one he had envisioned he believed he had been making a much more whimsical ... kaleidoscopic film than what came together in the edit suite instead mendes was drawn to the emotion and darkness he began to use the score and shots he had intended to discard to craft the film along these lines in total he cut about 30 minutes from his original edit the opening included a dream in which lester imagines himself flying above the town mendes spent two days filming spacey against bluescreen but removed the sequence as he believed it to be too whimsical — like a coen brothers movie — and therefore inappropriate for the tone he was trying to set the opening in the final cut reused a scene from the middle of the film where jane tells ricky to kill her father this scene was to be the revelation to the audience that the pair was not responsible for lester's death as the way it was scored and acted made it clear that jane's request was not serious however in the portion he used in the opening — and when the full scene plays out later — mendes used the score and a reaction shot of ricky to leave a lingering ambiguity as to his guilt the subsequent shot — an aerial view of the neighborhood — was originally intended as the plate shot for the bluescreen effects in the dream sequence
mendes spent more time recutting the first 10 minutes than the rest of the film taken together he trialled several versions of the opening the first edit included bookend scenes in which jane and ricky are convicted of lester's murder but mendes excised these in the last week of editing because he felt they made the film lose its mystery and because they did not fit with the theme of redemption that had emerged during production mendes believed the trial drew focus away from the characters and turned the film into an episode of nypd blue instead he wanted the ending to be a poetic mixture of dream and memory and narrative resolution when ball first saw a completed edit it was a version with truncated versions of these scenes he felt that they were so short that they didn 't really register mendes and he argued but ball was more accepting after mendes cut the sequences completely ball felt that without the scenes the film was more optimistic and had evolved into something that for all its darkness had a really romantic heart
conrad hall was not the first choice for director of photography mendes believed he was too old and too experienced to want the job and he had been told that hall was difficult to work with instead mendes asked fred elmes who turned the job down because he did not like the script hall was recommended to mendes by tom cruise because of hall's work on without limits 1998 which cruise had executive produced mendes was directing cruise's then-wife nicole kidman in the play the blue room during preproduction on american beauty and had already storyboarded the whole film hall was involved for one month during preproduction his ideas for lighting the film began with his first reading of the script and further passes allowed him to refine his approach before meeting mendes hall was initially concerned that audiences would not like the characters he only felt able to identify with them during cast rehearsals which gave him fresh ideas on his approach to the visuals
hall's approach was to create peaceful compositions that evoked classicism to contrast with the turbulent on-screen events and allow audiences to take in the action hall and mendes first discussed the intended mood of a scene but he was allowed to light the shot in any way he felt necessary in most cases hall first lit the scene's subject by painting in the blacks and whites before adding fill light which he reflected from beadboard or white card on the ceiling this approach gave hall more control over the shadows while keeping the fill light unobtrusive and the dark areas free of spill hall shot american beauty in a 2.39 1 aspect ratio in the super 35 format using kodak vision 500t 5279 35 mm film stock he used super 35 partly because its larger scope allowed him to capture elements such as the corners of the petal-filled pool in its overhead shot creating a frame around angela within he shot the whole film at the same t-stop t1.9 given his preference for shooting that wide hall favored high-speed stocks to allow for more subtle lighting effects he used panavision platinum cameras with the company's primo series of prime and zoom lenses hall employed kodak vision 200t 5274 and exr 5248 stock for scenes with daylight effects he had difficulty adjusting to kodak's newly introduced vision release print stock which combined with his contrast-heavy lighting style created a look with too much contrast hall contacted kodak who sent him a batch of 5279 that was 5 lower in contrast hall used a 1 8 inch tiffen black promist filter for almost every scene which he said in retrospect may not have been the best choice as the optical steps required to blow super 35 up for its anamorphic release print led to a slight amount of degradation therefore the diffusion from the filter was not required when he saw the film in a theater hall felt that the image was slightly unclear and that had he not used the filter the diffusion from the super 35–anamorphic conversion would have generated an image closer to what he originally intended
a shot where lester and ricky share a cannabis joint behind a building came from a misunderstanding between hall and mendes mendes asked hall to prepare the shot in his absence hall assumed the characters would look for privacy so he placed them in a narrow passage between a truck and the building intending to light from the top of the truck when mendes returned he explained that the characters did not care if they were seen he removed the truck and hall had to rethink the lighting he lit it from the left with a large light crossing the actors and with a soft light behind the camera hall felt the consequent wide shot worked perfectly for the tone of the scene hall made sure to keep rain or the suggestion of it in every shot near the end of the film in one shot during lester's encounter with angela at the burnhams'home hall created rain effects on the foreground cross lights in another he partly lit the pair through french windows to which he had added material to make the rain run slower intensifying the light although the strength of the outside light was unrealistic for a night scene hall felt it justified because of the strong contrasts it produced for the close-ups when lester and angela move to the couch hall tried to keep rain in the frame lighting through the window onto the ceiling behind lester he also used rain boxes to produce rain patterns where he wanted without lighting the entire room
thomas newman's score was recorded in santa monica california he mainly used percussion instruments to create the mood and rhythm the inspiration for which was provided by mendes newman favored pulse rhythm and color over melody making for a more minimalist score than he had previously created he built each cue around small endlessly repeating phrases — often the only variety through a thinning of the texture for eight bars the percussion instruments included tablas bongos cymbals piano xylophones and marimbas also featured were guitars flute and world music instruments newman also used electronic music and on quirkier tracks employed more unorthodox methods such as tapping metal mixing bowls with a finger and using a detuned mandolin newman believed the score helped move the film along without disturbing the moral ambiguity of the script it was a real delicate balancing act in terms of what music worked to preserve that
the soundtrack features songs by newman bobby darin the who free eels the guess who bill withers betty carter peggy lee the folk implosion gomez and bob dylan as well as two cover versions — the beatles'" because performed by elliott smith and neil young's don 't let it bring you down performed by annie lennox produced by the film's music supervisor chris douridas an abridged soundtrack album was released on october 5 1999 and went on to be nominated for a grammy award for best soundtrack album an album featuring 19 tracks from newman's score was released on january 11 2000 and won the grammy award for best score soundtrack album filmmaker considered the score to be one of newman's best saying it enabled the film's transcendentalist aspirations in 2006 the magazine chose the score as one of 20 essential soundtracks it believed spoke to the complex and innovative relationships between music and screen storytelling
dreamworks contracted amazon.com to create the official website marking the first time that amazon had created a special section devoted to a feature film the website included an overview a photo gallery cast and crew filmographies and exclusive interviews with spacey and bening the film's tagline — look closer — originally came from a cutting pasted on lester's workplace cubicle by the set dresser dreamworks ran parallel marketing campaigns and trailers — one aimed at adults the other at teenagers both trailers ended with the poster image of a girl holding a rose reviewing the posters of several 1999 films david hochman of entertainment weekly rated american beauty's highly saying it evoked the tagline he said you return to the poster again and again thinking this time you 're gonna find something dreamworks did not want to test screen the film according to mendes the studio was pleased with it but he insisted on one where he could question the audience afterward the studio reluctantly agreed and showed the film to a young audience in san jose california mendes claimed the screening went very well

american beauty was widely considered the best film of 1999 by the american press it received overwhelming praise chiefly for spacey mendes and ball variety reported that no other 1999 movie has benefited from such universal raves it was the best-received title at the toronto international film festival tiff where it won the people's choice award after a ballot of the festival's audiences tiff's director piers handling said american beauty was the buzz of the festival the film most talked-about
writing in variety todd mccarthy said the cast ensemble could not be better he praised spacey's handling of innuendo subtle sarcasm and blunt talk and the way he imbued lester with genuine feeling janet maslin in the new york times said spacey was at his wittiest and most agile to date and roger ebert of the chicago sun-times singled spacey out for successfully portraying a man who does reckless and foolish things but who doesn 't deceive himself kevin jackson of sight sound said spacey impressed in ways distinct from his previous performances the most satisfying aspect being his portrayal of both sap and hero writing in film quarterly gary hentzi praised the actors but said that characters such as carolyn and col. fitts were stereotypes hentzi accused mendes and ball of identifying too readily with jane and ricky saying the latter was their fantasy figure — a teenaged boy who's an absurdly wealthy artist able to finance his own projects hentzi said angela was the most believable teenager in particular with her painfully familiar attempts to live up to an unworthy image of herself maslin agreed that some characters were unoriginal but said their detailed characterizations made them memorable kenneth turan of the los angeles times said the actors coped faultlessly with what were difficult roles he called spacey's performance the energy that drives the film saying the actor commanded audience involvement despite lester not always being sympathetic against considerable odds we do like these characters turan concluded
maslin felt that mendes directed with terrific visual flair saying his minimalist style balanced the mordant and bright and that he evoked the delicate eroticized power-playing vignettes of his theater work jackson said mendes'theatrical roots rarely showed and that the most remarkable aspect was that spacey's performance did not overshadow the film he said that mendes worked the script's intricacies smoothly to the ensemble's strengths and staged the tonal shifts skillfully mccarthy believed american beauty a stunning card of introduction for film débutantes mendes and ball he said mendes'" sure hand was as precise and controlled as his theater work mccarthy cited hall's involvement as fortunate for mendes as the cinematographer was unsurpassed at conveying the themes of a work turan agreed that mendes'choice of collaborators was shrewd naming hall and newman in particular turan suggested that american beauty may have benefited from mendes'inexperience as his anything's possible daring made him attempt beats that more seasoned directors might have avoided turan felt that mendes'accomplishment was to capture and enhance the duality of ball's script — the simultaneously caricatured ... and painfully real characters hentzi while critical of many of mendes and ball's choices admitted the film showed off their considerable talents
turan cited ball's lack of constraint when writing the film as the reason for its uniqueness in particular the script's subtle changes in tone mccarthy said the script was as fresh and distinctive as any of its american film contemporaries and praised how it analyzed the characters while not compromising narrative pace he called ball's dialogue tart and said the characters — carolyn excepted — were deeply drawn one other flaw mccarthy said was the revelation of col. fitts'homosexuality which he said evoked hoary freudianism jackson said the film transcended its clichéd setup to become a wonderfully resourceful and sombre comedy he said that even when the film played for sitcom laughs it did so with unexpected nuance hentzi criticized how the film made a mystery of lester's murder believing it manipulative and simply a way of generating suspense mccarthy cited the production and costume design as pluses and said the soundtrack was good at creating ironic counterpoint s to the story hentzi concluded that american beauty was vital but uneven he felt the film's examination of the ways which teenagers and adults imagine each other's lives was its best point and that although lester and angela's dynamic was familiar its romantic irony stood beside the most enduring literary treatments of the theme such as lolita nevertheless hentzi believed that the film's themes of materialism and conformity in american suburbia were hackneyed mccarthy conceded that the setting was familiar but said it merely provided the film with a starting point from which to tell its subtle and acutely judged tale maslin agreed she said that while it takes aim at targets that are none too fresh and that the theme of nonconformity did not surprise the film had its own corrosive novelty ebert awarded american beauty four stars out of four and turan said it was layered subversive complex and surprising concluding it was a hell of a picture
a few months after the film's release reports of a backlash appeared in the american press and the years since have seen its critical regard wane in 2005 premiere named american beauty as one of 20 most overrated movies of all time mendes accepted the inevitability of the critical reappraisal saying i thought some of it was entirely justified — it was a little overpraised at the time
currently the film holds an 88 score on rotten tomatoes based on 180 reviews with an average rating of 8.2 10 the critical consensus reads flawlessly cast and brimming with dark acid wit american beauty is a smart provocative high point of late'90s mainstream hollywood film metacritic gives the film a score of 86 based on 33 reviews indicating universal acclaim
american beauty was not considered an immediate favorite to dominate the american awards season several other contenders opened at the end of 1999 and us critics spread their honors among them when compiling their end-of-year lists the chicago film critics association and the broadcast film critics association named the film the best of 1999 but while the new york film critics circle the national society of film critics and the los angeles film critics association recognized american beauty they gave their top awards to other films by the end of the year reports of a critical backlash suggested american beauty was the underdog in the race for best picture however at the golden globe awards in january 2000 american beauty won best film best director and best screenplay
as the nominations for the 72nd academy awards approached a frontrunner had not emerged dreamworks had launched a major campaign for american beauty five weeks before ballots were due to be sent to the 5,600 academy award voters its campaign combined traditional advertising and publicity with more focused strategies although direct mail campaigning was prohibited dreamworks reached voters by promoting the film in casual comfortable settings in voters'communities the studio's candidate for best picture the previous year saving private ryan lost to shakespeare in love so the studio took a new approach by hiring outsiders to provide input for the campaign it hired three veteran consultants who told the studio to think small nancy willen encouraged dreamworks to produce a special about the making of american beauty to set up displays of the film in the communities'bookstores and to arrange a question-and-answer session with mendes for the british academy of film and television arts dale olson advised the studio to advertise in free publications that circulated in beverly hills — home to many voters — in addition to major newspapers olson arranged to screen american beauty to about 1,000 members of the actors fund of america as many participating actors were also voters bruce feldman took ball to the santa barbara international film festival where ball attended a private dinner in honor of anthony hopkins meeting several voters who were in attendance

gore graduated in 1776 and promptly enlisted in the continental artillery regiment of his brother-in-law thomas crafts where he served as a clerk until 1778 the gore family was divided by the war gore's father was a loyalist who left boston when the british army evacuated the city in march 1776 gore was consequently called upon to support his mother and three sisters who remained in boston in 1779 gore successfully petitioned the state for the remaining family's share of his father's seized assets
after his military service gore studied law with john lowell and was admitted to the bar in 1778 after a comparatively brief tutelage gore's law practice flourished in part because many loyalist lawyers had fled massachusetts gore's clients included loyalists seeking to recover some of their assets as well as london-based british merchants with claims to pursue his briefs were generally well-reasoned and he was seen as a successful trial lawyer
gore grew his fortune by investing carefully in revolutionary currency and bonds the securities he purchased were paper that had been given to continental army soldiers in lieu of pay which they often sold at a steep discount one batch of securities he purchased for instance cost him about 3,700 but had a face value of 25,000 in 1785 he married rebecca amory payne daughter of a wealthy merchant maritime insurer and director of the bank of massachusetts the couple were known for their social graces and became prominent members of boston society
in 1786 gore became concerned about a rise in anti-lawyer sentiment in massachusetts grievances over harsh policies pursued by governor james bowdoin blossomed into shays'rebellion which required militia action to crush in 1787 gore was one of several high-profile lawyers assigned to defend participants in the rebellion included in this group were theodore sedgwick caleb strong james sullivan levi lincoln sr. and thomas dawes although many rebels were ultimately convicted a large number received amnesty in 1788 gore was elected a delegate to the 1789 massachusetts convention that ratified the united states constitution his election was contested because boston where he lived was at the time more inclined toward state power gore nonetheless was strongly federalist urging support of the new constitution
in 1788 gore was elected to the massachusetts house of representatives he took a leading role in adopting the state's rules for actions required of it by the new federal constitution by his proposal the legislature decided that presidential electors would be chosen by a joint session he also proposed that the state house and senate agree by separate votes on choices for the united states senate a process that would significantly reduce popular input to the choice his choice was ultimately rejected in favor of a process whereby the house selected a slate of candidates from which the senate would choose one in 1789 gore decided to stand for reelection but lost owing to strong anti-nationalist fervor in boston at the time he managed to win a seat later when a special election was held after resignations opened several seats
gore's financial speculations in the late 1780s significantly multiplied his wealth in 1788 he and andrew craigie a boston businessman who had retained gore for legal services entered into a secret agreement to purchase continental securities with a face value of 100,000 in a speculative bid that their value would rise by late october of that year the pair had met this goal gore had purchased 90,000 worth of paper for about 20,000 and encouraged craigie to purchase more than the 11,000 he had acquired if his funding would allow for it gore also purchased massachusetts war-related debts and lobbied massachusetts congressmen for the u.s. government to assume those as well
gore's windfall was realized when in 1790 the united states congress acting on a proposal made by alexander hamilton and supported by gore's friend rufus king passed legislation that exchanged continental and state paper for new u.s. paper at face value not only did gore win on this exchange but the paper he received appreciated in value before he sold it the exact amount he made is unclear from the surviving documents john quincy adams wrote that gore's speculations made him the wealthiest lawyer in the country
the success of gore's speculations prompted him to enter a partnership with craigie william duer and daniel parker in an attempt to acquire u.s. foreign debt obligations on favorable terms parker was a business partner of craigie's and duer was an influential new york businessman and treasury department official whose lavish lifestyle impressed gore the partnership promoted sales of u.s. lands in europe and sought to acquire u.s. obligations to france although gore sank 10,000 into this venture it failed more powerful and experienced dutch bankers outmaneuvered the americans gore also engaged in other ventures with these partners but apparently carefully stayed with financial speculations and avoided the partners'less successful land ventures
much of gore's financial activity was mediated through the bank of massachusetts where his father-in-law was a director gore himself was elected to its board in 1785 when he also became a shareholder during his time on the board the bank tightened its regulations on loan repayments a move that improved the stability of its capital gore used the bank for most of his personal deposits but also drew on lines of credit for as much as several thousand dollars the bank shares he held paid relatively high dividends until 1791 when the bank received serious competition from the first bank of the united states
the bank of the united states was established by alexander hamilton to provide stable banking services on a national scale and sought to open a branch in boston hamilton recruited heavily in the bank of massachusetts and gore decided to make the move he sold his shares in the massachusetts bank and became a director of the boston branch of the u.s. bank he also purchased 200 shares in the new bank a relatively large investment gore was influential in making hiring decisions for the branch and sought to merge state-chartered banks into the organization arguing that only a nationally chartered bank could provide consistent and stable service gore resigned from the board in 1794 citing the demands of his law practice
gore's financial successes enabled him to join the elite society of boston in 1789 he purchased a large mansion on fashionable bowdoin square and also bought a country estate in waltham that grew over time to 300 acres 120 ha he had a house built on the estate most of which he operated as a gentleman farmer he and other similarly-situated federalists formed the massachusetts society for promoting agriculture of which he served as a trustee for several years the organization was not seen as significantly contributing to advances in agriculture
in 1789 president george washington appointed gore the first united states attorney for massachusetts as a reward for his support gore controversially refused to resign from the state legislature arguing that the state constitution's prohibitions against holding multiple offices did not apply to federal posts he eventually resigned the legislative seat under protest because of pressure from his fellow legislators
gore served as district attorney until 1796 his principal matter of concern was the enforcement of u.s. neutrality with respect to the french revolutionary wars he attempted several times to prosecute the french consul in boston antoine duplaine for arming and operating privateers out of the port of boston but he was stymied by local juries that sympathized with the french duplaine was eventually expelled on orders from president george washington based on evidence provided by gore
gore also promoted anti-french sentiment with political writings in massachusetts newspapers writing under the pseudonym manlius he denounced the formation of democratic societies formed to oppose federalist policy and support pro-french positions he suggested to president washington that someone be sent to england to negotiate with the british john jay traveled to london in 1794 and negotiated the jay treaty whose ratification gore vocally supported although gore was hostile to french policy he was on friendly terms with individual frenchmen he hosted the future french statesman talleyrand when he visited the u.s.
in 1796 washington appointed him as a commissioner representing the united states to handle maritime claims under the terms the jay treaty as a result the gores moved to england that year establishing a residence in the fashionable hyde park area the commission was established to arbitrate claims emanating from british seizures of american vessels and cargoes and from british claims relating to violations of american neutrality in the ongoing french revolutionary wars it consisted of three americans gore william pinkney and john trumbull and two british commissioners john nicoll and nicholas astley trumbull was chosen by the other four because he was deemed to sufficiently fair-minded to cast deciding votes in the event of disagreements that year he was also elected a fellow of the american academy of arts and sciences
although gore was well received by the british establishment the work suffered from what gore called a tediousness of process and he considered requesting a transfer in 1798 in 1800 it ground to a halt because another board established by the treaty to resolve outstanding revolutionary war claims against the united states had not yet met and the british stopped the claims processing until resolution of the other issues got underway gore used this break to briefly return to america and assess the condition of his waltham estate where the house had been largely destroyed by fire in 1799 after his return to london with the commission work still stopped he and rebecca embarked on a tour of europe they visited holland belgium and switzerland and spent six months in paris during this trip and later ones in england and scotland they took note of the architecture of country estates and began planning a new house for their waltham property
the commission resumed its work in early 1802 and had resolved all outstanding claims by august 1803 it awarded 110,000 to british claimants and over 6 million to american claimants the lopsided result is due to the vastly larger number of american claims but also to some key early decisions that favored american interpretations in the processing of the claims and by a british administration that sought to remain in america's good graces
the gore's social circle in england revolved around his good friend rufus king who was appointed ambassador to great britain in 1796 along with other massachusetts expatriates when king left his post in may 1803 he named gore to head the london embassy as chargé d 'affaires although president thomas jefferson never issued a formal appointment the british government accepted his role for the two-month interval between king's departure and the arrival of james monroe as king's replacement the gores sailed for boston in the spring of 1804
rebecca gore used their exposure to european country estates to design a lavish new building for their waltham estate during their english sojourn designed with the assistance of french architect joseph-guillaume legrand and probably also influenced by the works of english architect sir john soane the house that was built upon their return to the united states in 1804 now known as gore place is one of the finest extant examples of federalist architecture
soon after his return to the united states gore reentered state politics winning election to the massachusetts senate he was active in the state federalist party organization sitting on its secret central committee he resumed his law practice in which he took on as a student daniel webster one of the highest profile cases he took on was the 1807 defense of thomas selfridge accused of murdering charles austin selfridge an older federalist attorney had been retained to assist in the collection of a debt from austin's republican father in the politically charged atmosphere of the day in boston selfridge fearing for his own safety had armed himself with a dueling pistol the younger austin had apparently on his own initiative sought to beat selfridge with a cane and selfridge fatally shot him in the encounter selfridge was prosecuted by attorney general and future gore gubernatorial opponent james sullivan and the defense also included arch-federalist harrison gray otis gore argued selfridge acted in self-defense selfridge was acquitted of murder by a jury whose foreman was patriot and federalist paul revere after fifteen minutes'deliberation
gore also resumed business activities upon his return he invested in a wide variety of businesses and infrastructure spurring economic activity in the state his investments ranged widely including maritime insurance where is father-in-law had made his fortune bridges locks canals and textiles he was a major investor in the middlesex canal the craigie bridge the first to connect boston to cambridge and the boston manufacturing company whose factory proving the single-site production of textiles was in waltham near his estate not all of his ventures panned out the canal was in the long run a financial failure as were efforts with other collaborators to develop lechmere point the cambridge side of the craigie bridge the textile mill however was a success and gore invested in the merrimack manufacturing company when it decided to locate in what is now lowell massachusetts gore purchased shares in the proprietors of locks and canals which operated and still owns today the lowell canals
in 1806 gore won election to the state senate that year the republicans were in the majority and the election for governor was close enough to require a recount the legislature scrutinized the ballots in a partisan manner for example retaining ballots containing misspelled versions of republican james sullivan's name and discarding similar ballots marked for federalist caleb strong gore and other federalists raised a public outcry and the legislature relented eventually certifying strong as the winner
gore ran unsuccessfully for governor of massachusetts in 1807 and 1808 against a rising tide of republicanism in the state losing both times to moderate republican james sullivan the federalists gained control of the state legislature in 1808 in a backlash against republican economic policies but gore was criticized for his failure to aggressively support state protests against the embargo act of 1807 which had a major negative effect on the state's large merchant fleet gore was in 1808 elected to the massachusetts house of representatives where he successfully led federalist efforts to ensure the selection of a federalist slate of presidential electors he also spearheaded actions to drive senator john quincy adams from the federalist party over his support of thomas jefferson's foreign policy the legislature elected adams'successor nine months early and gave adams sufficiently distasteful instructions that he resigned the post and joined with the republicans
gore led the federalists to victory in 1809 against sullivan's successor levi lincoln sr. who had taken over as acting governor upon sullivan's death late in 1808 during gore's term the principal domestic issue occupying state politics was a banking crisis stimulated by the federal policy of embargoing trade with great britain and france then embroiled in the napoleonic wars although the crisis caused a number of bank failures in new england massachusetts banks largely escaped unscathed
foreign policy played a major role in gore's administration the legislature passed resolves opposing the federal government's hardline policy against trade and diplomatic relations with the united kingdom then embroiled in the napoleonic wars and gore in early 1810 invited francis james jackson who had been rejected as the uk's ambassador to the us to visit the state this pressure may have played a role in president james madison's decision to renew relations with the uk and accept jackson's credentials
the lessening of the war threat and the choice by the republicans of the popular elbridge gerry as their candidate brought a challenge to federalist control of massachusetts in the 1810 elections the unostentatious gerry and republican partisans criticized gore for his lavish lifestyle including his palatial waltham residence and pompous activities he organized as governor and highlighted his loyalist family connections while emphasizing gerry's unimpeachable patriotism gerry won the election jackson did visit boston but he was greeted not by gore but gerry gore ran against gerry again in 1811 but lost in another acrimonious campaign
gore was granted an honorary law degree from harvard in 1809 he served on the college's board of overseers from 1810 to 1815 and as a fellow from 1816 to 1820 harvard's first library building a gothic structure built in 1838 of quincy granite was named in his honor but was demolished when widener library was built in its place in 1915 this structure is found on the seal of the city of cambridge one of the residential winthrop house's buildings is called gore hall in his honor
in the spring of 1813 he was appointed by governor caleb strong to fill the u.s. senate seat vacated by the resignation of senator james lloyd he served from may 5 1813 to may 30 1816 winning reelection to the seat in 1814 he opposed the ongoing war of 1812 in these years with his earlier diplomatic experience providing valuable knowledge to federalist interests he expressed approval of the 1814 hartford convention in which the new england states aired grievances concerning republican governance of the country and the conduct of the war
gore assented to the treaty of ghent that ended the war but was unhappy that the nation had not gained anything from the war he resigned in june 1816 unhappy with the politics of washington and suffering from poor health although he was no longer active in politics he continued to express opinions on the subjects of the day opposing the 1820 missouri compromise and bemoaning the great moderation mediocrity of federalist governor john brooks
gore remained active in the administration of harvard and was active in a number of organizations including the american academy of arts and sciences and the massachusetts historical society whose president he was from 1806 to 1818 he was also elected a member of the american antiquarian society in 1814 gore spent most of his later years at his country estate in waltham suffering from worsening rheumatoid arthritis that made walking increasingly difficult his declining health and lack of social scene in waltham led him in 1822 to return to boston in the winters he died on march 1 1827 in boston and is buried in its granary burying ground
gore's wife died in 1834 the couple had no children the major beneficiary of the gore estate was harvard which received an estimated 100,000 although bequests were also made to the american academy of arts and sciences and the massachusetts historical society the waltham estate passed through several hands and was subdivided over time the mansion was saved from demolition by the gore place society established for the purpose of preserving it which now operates it as a museum it was declared a national historic landmark in 1970
nero ˈnɪəroʊ latin nerō claudius caesar augustus germanicus 15 december 37 ad–9 june 68 ad was roman emperor from 54 to 68 and the last in the julio-claudian dynasty nero was adopted by his grand-uncle claudius to become his heir and successor and succeeded to the throne in 54 following claudius'death
nero focused much of his attention on diplomacy trade and enhancing the cultural life of the empire but according to the historian tacitus he was viewed by the roman people as compulsive and corrupt he ordered theatres built and promoted athletic games during his reign the redoubtable general corbulo conducted a successful war and negotiated peace with the parthian empire his general suetonius paulinus crushed a revolt in britain nero annexed the bosporan kingdom to the empire and began the first jewish–roman war
in 64 ad most of rome was destroyed in the great fire of rome which many romans believed nero himself had started in order to clear land for his planned palatial complex the domus aurea in 68 the rebellion of vindex in gaul and later the acclamation of galba in hispania drove nero from the throne facing a false report of being denounced as a public enemy who was to be executed he committed suicide on 9 june 68 the first roman emperor to do so his death ended the julio-claudian dynasty sparking a brief period of civil wars known as the year of the four emperors nero's rule is often associated with tyranny and extravagance he is known for many executions including that of his mother and the probable murder by poison of his stepbrother britannicus
nero was rumored to have had captured christians dipped in oil and set on fire in his garden at night as a source of light this view is based on the writings of tacitus suetonius and cassius dio the main surviving sources for nero's reign but a few surviving sources paint nero in a more favourable light some sources including some mentioned above portray him as an emperor who was popular with the common roman people especially in the east some modern historians question the reliability of ancient sources when reporting on nero's tyrannical acts
lucius domitius ahenobarbus nero was born on 15 december 37 in antium modern anzio and nettuno near rome he was the only son of gnaeus domitius ahenobarbus and agrippina the younger sister of emperor caligula
nero's father gnaeus was the son of lucius domitius ahenobarbus consul 16 bc and antonia major gnaeus was thus the grandson of gnaeus domitius ahenobarbus consul 32 bc and probably aemilia lepida on his father's side and the grandson of mark antony and octavia minor on his mother's side thus nero had as his paternal grandmother antonia major and also claimed more remote descent from antonia minor as a great-grandson — later grandson after claudius adopted him
through octavia nero was the great-nephew of caesar augustus nero's father had been employed as a praetor and was a member of caligula's staff when the latter travelled to the east some apparently think suetonius refers to augustus's adopted son gaius caesar here but this is not likely
nero's father was described by suetonius as a murderer and a cheat who was charged by emperor tiberius with treason adultery and incest tiberius died allowing him to escape these charges nero's father died of edema dropsy in 39 when nero was two
nero's mother was agrippina the younger a great-granddaughter of caesar augustus and his wife scribonia through their daughter julia the elder and her husband marcus vipsanius agrippa agrippina's father germanicus was a grandson of augustus's wife livia on one side and to mark antony and octavia on the other germanicus'mother antonia minor was a daughter of octavia minor and mark antony octavia was augustus'elder sister germanicus was also the adopted son of tiberius agrippina poisoned her second husband passienus crispus so many ancient historians also accuse her of murdering her third husband the emperor claudius
nero was not expected to become emperor because his maternal uncle caligula had begun his reign at the age of 24 with enough time to produce his own heir nero's mother agrippina lost favour with caligula and was exiled in 39 after her husband's death caligula seized nero's inheritance and sent him to be brought up by his less wealthy aunt domitia lepida who was the mother of valeria messalina claudius's third wife caligula his wife caesonia and their infant daughter julia drusilla were murdered on 24 january 41 these events led claudius caligula's uncle to become emperor claudius allowed agrippina to return from exile
claudius had married twice before marrying valeria messalina his previous marriages produced three children including a son drusus who died at a young age he had two children with messalina–claudia octavia born 40 and britannicus born 41 messalina was executed by claudius in the year 48
in 49 ad claudius married a fourth time to nero's mother agrippina despite her being his niece to aid claudius politically young nero was adopted in 50 and took the name nero claudius caesar drusus germanicus see adoption in rome nero was older than his stepbrother britannicus and thus became heir to the throne
nero was proclaimed an adult in 51 at the age of 14 he was appointed proconsul entered and first addressed the senate made joint public appearances with claudius and was featured in coinage in 53 he married his stepsister claudia octavia
claudius died in 54 and nero taking the name nero claudius caesar augustus germanicus was established as emperor though accounts vary many ancient historians state agrippina poisoned claudius according to pliny the elder she used poison mushrooms it is not known how much nero knew or if he was even involved in the death of claudius
suetonius wrote ... for even if he was not the instigator of the emperor's death he was at least privy to it as he openly admitted for he used afterwards to laud mushrooms the vehicle in which the poison was administered to claudius as the food of the gods as the greek proverb has it at any rate after claudius'death he vented on him every kind of insult in act and word charging him now with folly and now with cruelty for it was a favourite joke of his to say that claudius had ceased to play the fool among mortals lengthening the first syllable of the word morari and he disregarded many of his decrees and acts as the work of a madman and a dotard finally he neglected to enclose the place where his body was burned except with a low and mean wall
according to suetonius nero became emperor at the age of 17 when the news of claudius'death was made known making him the youngest emperor at that time although what suetonius may have meant is that he was in his seventeenth year as his date of birth also listed by suetonius would have made him 16 at the time of claudius'death tacitus in book xiii of his annals describes nero as being'scarcely out of his boyhood'at the time he became emperor ancient historians describe nero's early reign as being strongly influenced by his mother agrippina his tutor lucius annaeus seneca and the praetorian prefect sextus afranius burrus especially in the first year other tutors were less often mentioned such as alexander of aegae
very early in nero's rule problems arose from competition for influence between agrippina and nero's two main advisers seneca and burrus agrippina also attempted to influence the young nero agrippina also is mentioned by ancient sources as scheming for her son nero this scheming continued as is evidenced by the coin of the both of them it is extremely unusual to see a women's face on a coin in the ancient world it is because of this position of power agrippina felt jealous as seneca in particular rose up in nero's court as he offered the advice nero wanted to hear unlike his mother
in 54 agrippina tried to sit down next to nero while he met with an armenian envoy but seneca stopped her and prevented a scandalous scene as it was unimaginable at that time for a woman to be in the same room as men doing official business nero's friends also mistrusted agrippina and told nero to beware of his mother
nero was reportedly unsatisfied with his marriage to octavia and entered into an affair with claudia acte a former slave in 55 agrippina attempted to intervene in favor of octavia and demanded that her son dismiss acte nero with the support of seneca resisted the intervention of his mother in his personal affairs
with agrippina's influence over her son severed she reportedly began pushing for britannicus nero's stepbrother to become emperor nearly fourteen-year-old britannicus heir-designate prior to nero's adoption was still legally a minor but was approaching legal adulthood according to tacitus agrippina hoped that with her support britannicus being the blood son of claudius would be seen as the true heir to the throne by the state over nero however the youth died suddenly and suspiciously on 12 february 55 the very day before his proclamation as an adult had been set
nero claimed that britannicus died from an epileptic seizure but ancient historians all claim britannicus'death came from nero's poisoning him supposedly he enlisted the services of locusta a woman who specialized in the manufacture of poisons she devised a mixture to kill britannicus but after testing it unsuccessfully on a slave nero angrily threatened to have her put to death if she did not come up with something usable locusta then devised a new concoction that she promised would kill swifter than a viper
her promise was fulfilled after britannicus consumed it at a dinner party from water used to cool his wine which had already been tasted and succumbed within minutes after the death of britannicus agrippina was accused of slandering octavia and nero ordered her out of the imperial residence
over time nero became progressively more powerful freeing himself of his advisers and eliminating rivals to the throne in 55 he removed marcus antonius pallas an ally of agrippina from his position in the treasury pallas along with burrus was accused of conspiring against the emperor to bring faustus sulla to the throne seneca was accused of having relations with agrippina and embezzlement seneca succeeded in having himself pallas and burrus acquitted according to cassius dio at this time seneca and burrus reduced their role in governing from careful management to mere moderation of nero
in 58 nero became romantically involved with poppaea sabina the wife of his friend and future emperor otho reportedly because a marriage to poppaea and a divorce from octavia did not seem politically feasible with agrippina alive nero ordered the murder of his mother in 59 a number of modern historians find this an unlikely motive as nero did not marry poppaea until 62
additionally according to suetonius poppaea did not divorce her husband until after agrippina's death making it unlikely that the already married poppaea would be pressing nero for marriage some modern historians theorize that nero's execution of agrippina was prompted by her plotting to set rubellius plautus on the throne according to suetonius nero tried to kill his mother through a shipwreck planned by his freedman tutor anicetus instead it took the life of agrippina's friend acerronia polla when agrippina survived he had her executed by anicetus and framed it as a suicide the incident is also recorded by tacitus
in 62 nero's adviser burrus died additionally seneca was again faced with embezzlement charges seneca asked nero for permission to retire from public affairs nero divorced and banished octavia on grounds of infertility leaving him free to marry the pregnant poppaea after public protests nero was forced to allow octavia to return from exile but she was executed shortly after her return
nero also was reported to have kicked poppaea to death in 65 before she could have his second child however modern historians noting suetonius tacitus and cassius dio's possible bias against nero and the likelihood that they did not have eyewitness accounts of private events postulate that poppaea may have died because of complications of miscarriage or childbirth
accusations of treason being plotted against nero and the senate first appeared in 62 the senate ruled that antistius a praetor should be put to death for speaking ill of nero at a party later nero ordered the exile of fabricius veiento who slandered the senate in a book tacitus writes that the roots of the conspiracy led by gaius calpurnius piso began in this year to consolidate power nero executed a number of people in 62 and 63 including his rivals pallas rubellius plautus and faustus sulla according to suetonius nero showed neither discrimination nor moderation in putting to death whomsoever he pleased during this period
nero's consolidation of power also included a slow usurping of authority from the senate in 54 nero promised to give the senate powers equivalent to those under republican rule by 65 senators complained that they had no power left and this led to the pisonian conspiracy
when nero's wife poppaea sabina died in 65 nero went into deep mourning her body was not cremated it was stuffed with spices embalmed and put in the mausoleum of augustus she was given a state funeral nero praised her during the funeral eulogy and gave her divine honors it is said that nero burned ten years'worth of arabia's incense production at her funeral
in the beginning of 66 he married statilia messalina she was already married when she became nero's mistress in 65 ad with statilia's husband being driven to suicide in 66 so nero could marry statilia she was one of the few of nero's courtiers who survived the fall of his reign
in 67 nero ordered a young freedman sporus to be castrated and then married him according to dion cassius sporus bore an uncanny resemblance to sabina and nero even called him by his dead wife's name
over the course of his reign nero often made rulings that pleased the lower class nero was criticized as being obsessed with personal popularity
nero began his reign in 54 by promising the senate more autonomy in this first year he forbade others to refer to him with regard to enactments for which he was praised by the senate nero was known for spending his time visiting brothels and taverns during this period
in 55 nero began taking on a more active role as an administrator he was consul four times between 55 and 60 during this period some ancient historians speak fairly well of nero and contrast it with his later rule
under nero restrictions were put on the amount of bail and fines also fees for lawyers were limited there was a discussion in the senate on the misconduct of the freedmen class and a strong demand was made that patrons should have the right of revoking freedom nero supported the freedmen and ruled that patrons had no such right
the senate tried to pass a law in which the crimes of one slave applied to all slaves within a household despite riots from the people nero supported the senate on their measure and deployed troops to organise the execution of 400 slaves affected by the law however he vetoed strong measures against the freedmen affected by the case
after tax collectors were accused of being too harsh to the poor nero transferred collection authority to lower commissioners nero banned any magistrate or procurator from exhibiting public entertainment for fear that the venue was being used as a method to sway the populace additionally there were many impeachments and removals of government officials along with arrests for extortion and corruption
when further complaints arose that the poor were being overly taxed nero attempted to repeal all indirect taxes the senate convinced him this action would bankrupt the public treasury as a compromise taxes were cut from 4.5 to 2.5 additionally secret government tax records were ordered to become public to lower the cost of food imports merchant ships were declared tax-exempt
in imitation of the greeks nero built a number of gymnasiums and theatres enormous gladiatorial shows were also held nero also established the quinquennial neronia the festival included games poetry and theater historians indicate that there was a belief that theatre led to immorality others considered that to have performers dressed in greek clothing was old fashioned some questioned the large public expenditure on entertainment
in 64 rome burned nero enacted a public relief effort as well as significant reconstruction a number of other major construction projects occurred in nero's late reign nero had the marshes of ostia filled with rubble from the fire he erected the large domus aurea in 67 nero attempted to have a canal dug at the isthmus of corinth ancient historians state that these projects and others exacerbated the drain on the state's budget
the cost to rebuild rome was immense requiring funds the state treasury did not have nero devalued the roman currency for the first time in the empire's history he reduced the weight of the denarius from 84 per roman pound to 96 3.85 grams to 3.35 grams he also reduced the silver purity from 99.5 to 93.5 — the silver weight dropping from 3.83 grams to 3.4 grams furthermore nero reduced the weight of the aureus from 40 per roman pound to 45 8 grams to 7.2 grams
between 62 and 67 according to plinius the elder and seneca nero promoted an expedition to discover the sources of the nile river it was the first exploration of equatorial africa from europe in history however nero's expedition up the nile failed upon reaching the impenetrable sudd of present-day south sudan
the economic policy of nero is a point of debate among scholars according to ancient historians nero's construction projects were overly extravagant and the large number of expenditures under nero left italy thoroughly exhausted by contributions of money with the provinces ruined modern historians though note that the period was riddled with deflation and that it is likely that nero's spending came in the form of public works projects and charity intended to ease economic troubles
the great fire of rome erupted on the night of 18 july to 19 july 64 the fire started at the southeastern end of the circus maximus in shops selling flammable goods
the extent of the fire is uncertain according to tacitus who was nine at the time of the fire it spread quickly and burned for over five days it destroyed three of fourteen roman districts and severely damaged seven the only other historian who lived through the period and mentioned the fire is pliny the elder who wrote about it in passing other historians who lived through the period including josephus dio chrysostom plutarch and epictetus make no mention of it in what remains of their work
it is uncertain who or what actually caused the fire — whether accident or arson suetonius and cassius dio favor nero as the arsonist so he could build a palatial complex tacitus mentions that christians confessed to the crime but it is not known whether these confessions were induced by torture however accidental fires were common in ancient rome in fact rome suffered other large fires in 69 and in 80
it was said by suetonius and cassius dio that nero sang the sack of ilium in stage costume while the city burned popular legend claims that nero played the fiddle at the time of the fire an anachronism based merely on the concept of the lyre a stringed instrument associated with nero and his performances the fiddle was not invented until the 10th century tacitus's account however has nero in antium at the time of the fire tacitus also said that nero playing his lyre and singing while the city burned was only rumor
according to tacitus upon hearing news of the fire nero returned to rome to organize a relief effort which he paid for from his own funds nero's contributions to the relief extended to personally taking part in the search for and rescue of victims of the blaze spending days searching the debris without even his bodyguards after the fire nero opened his palaces to provide shelter for the homeless and arranged for food supplies to be delivered in order to prevent starvation among the survivors
in the wake of the fire he made a new urban development plan houses after the fire were spaced out built in brick and faced by porticos on wide roads nero also built a new palace complex known as the domus aurea in an area cleared by the fire this included lush artificial landscapes and a 30-meter-tall statue of himself the colossus of nero the size of this complex is debated from 100 to 300 acres to find the necessary funds for the reconstruction tributes were imposed on the provinces of the empire
tacitus in one of the earliest non-christian references to the origins of christianity notes that the population searched for a scapegoat and rumors held nero responsible to deflect blame nero targeted christians he ordered christians to be thrown to dogs while others were crucified and burned
nero enjoyed driving a one-horse chariot singing to the lyre and poetry he even composed songs that were performed by other entertainers throughout the empire at first nero only performed for a private audience
in 64 ad nero began singing in public in neapolis in order to improve his popularity he also sang at the second quinquennial neronia in 65 it was said that nero craved the attention but historians also write that nero was encouraged to sing and perform in public by the senate his inner circle and the people ancient historians strongly criticize his choice to perform calling it shameful
nero was persuaded to participate in the olympic games of 67 in order to improve relations with greece and display roman dominance as a competitor nero raced a ten-horse chariot and nearly died after being thrown from it he also performed as an actor and a singer though nero faltered in his racing in one case dropping out entirely before the end and acting competitions he won these crowns nevertheless and paraded them when he returned to rome the victories are attributed to nero bribing the judges and his status as emperor
shortly after nero's accession to the throne in 54 the roman vassal kingdom of armenia overthrew their iberian prince rhadamistus and he was replaced with the parthian prince tiridates this was seen as a parthian invasion of roman territory there was concern in rome over how the young emperor would handle the situation nero reacted by immediately sending the military to the region under the command of gnaeus domitius corbulo the parthians temporarily relinquished control of armenia to rome
the peace did not last and full-scale war broke out in 58 the parthian king vologases i refused to remove his brother tiridates from armenia the parthians began a full-scale invasion of the armenian kingdom commander corbulo responded and repelled most of the parthian army that same year tiridates retreated and rome again controlled most of armenia
nero was acclaimed in public for this initial victory tigranes a cappadocian noble raised in rome was installed by nero as the new ruler of armenia corbulo was appointed governor of syria as a reward
in 62 tigranes invaded the parthian province of adiabene again rome and parthia were at war and this continued until 63 parthia began building up for a strike against the roman province of syria corbulo tried to convince nero to continue the war but nero opted for a peace deal instead there was anxiety in rome about eastern grain supplies and a budget deficit
the result was a deal where tiridates again became the armenian king but was crowned in rome by emperor nero in the future the king of armenia was to be a parthian prince but his appointment required approval from the romans tiridates was forced to come to rome and partake in ceremonies meant to display roman dominance
this peace deal of 63 was a considerable victory for nero politically nero became very popular in the eastern provinces of rome and with the parthians as well the peace between parthia and rome lasted 50 years until emperor trajan of rome invaded armenia in 114
the war with parthia was not nero's only major war but he was both criticized and praised for an aversion to battle like many emperors nero faced a number of rebellions and power struggles within the empire
british revolt of 60–61 boudica's uprising
in 60 a major rebellion broke out in the province of britannia while the governor gaius suetonius paulinus and his troops were busy capturing the island of mona anglesey from the druids the tribes of the southeast staged a revolt led by queen boudica of the iceni boudica and her troops destroyed three cities before the army of paulinus could return receive reinforcements and quell the rebellion in 61 fearing paulinus himself would provoke further rebellion nero replaced him with the more passive publius petronius turpilianus
the pisonian conspiracy of 65
in 65 gaius calpurnius piso a roman statesman organized a conspiracy against nero with the help of subrius flavus and sulpicius asper a tribune and a centurion of the praetorian guard according to tacitus many conspirators wished to rescue the state from the emperor and restore the republic the freedman milichus discovered the conspiracy and reported it to nero's secretary epaphroditos as a result the conspiracy failed and its members were executed including lucan the poet nero's previous advisor seneca was ordered to commit suicide after admitting he discussed the plot with the conspirators
the first jewish war of 66–70
in 66 there was a jewish revolt in judea stemming from greek and jewish religious tension in 67 nero dispatched vespasian to restore order this revolt was eventually put down in 70 after nero's death this revolt is famous for romans breaching the walls of jerusalem and destroying the second temple of jerusalem
in march 68 gaius julius vindex the governor of gallia lugdunensis rebelled against nero's tax policies lucius verginius rufus the governor of germania superior was ordered to put down vindex's rebellion in an attempt to gain support from outside his own province vindex called upon servius sulpicius galba the governor of hispania tarraconensis to join the rebellion and further to declare himself emperor in opposition to nero
at the battle of vesontio in may 68 verginius'forces easily defeated those of vindex and the latter committed suicide however after putting down this one rebel verginius'legions attempted to proclaim their own commander as emperor verginius refused to act against nero but the discontent of the legions of germany and the continued opposition of galba in spain did not bode well for him
while nero had retained some control of the situation support for galba increased despite his being officially declared a public enemy the prefect of the praetorian guard gaius nymphidius sabinus also abandoned his allegiance to the emperor and came out in support for galba
in response nero fled rome with the intention of going to the port of ostia and from there to take a fleet to one of the still-loyal eastern provinces according to suetonius nero abandoned the idea when some army officers openly refused to obey his commands responding with a line from vergil's aeneid is it so dreadful a thing then to die nero then toyed with the idea of fleeing to parthia throwing himself upon the mercy of galba or to appeal to the people and beg them to pardon him for his past offences and if he could not soften their hearts to entreat them at least to allow him the prefecture of egypt suetonius reports that the text of this speech was later found in nero's writing desk but that he dared not give it from fear of being torn to pieces before he could reach the forum
nero returned to rome and spent the evening in the palace after sleeping he awoke at about midnight to find the palace guard had left dispatching messages to his friends'palace chambers for them to come he received no answers upon going to their chambers personally he found them all abandoned when he called for a gladiator or anyone else adept with a sword to kill him no one appeared he cried have i neither friend nor foe and ran out as if to throw himself into the tiber
returning nero sought for some place where he could hide and collect his thoughts an imperial freedman phaon offered his villa located 4 miles outside the city travelling in disguise nero and four loyal freedmen epaphroditos phaon neophytus and sporus reached the villa where nero ordered them to dig a grave for him
at this time a courier arrived with a report that the senate had declared nero a public enemy and that it was their intention to execute him by beating him to death and that armed men had been sent to apprehend him for the act to take place in the forum the senate actually was still reluctant and deliberating on the right course of action as nero was the last member of the julio-claudian family indeed most of the senators had served the imperial family all their lives and felt a sense of loyalty to the deified bloodline if not to nero himself the men actually had the goal of returning nero back to the senate where the senate hoped to work out a compromise with the rebelling governors that would preserve nero's life so that at least a future heir to the dynasty could be produced
nero however did not know this and at the news brought by the courier he prepared himself for suicide pacing up and down muttering qualis artifex pereo which translates to english as what an artist dies in me losing his nerve he first begged for one of his companions to set an example by first killing himself at last the sound of approaching horsemen drove nero to face the end however he still could not bring himself to take his own life but instead he forced his private secretary epaphroditos to perform the task
when one of the horsemen entered upon his seeing nero all but dead he attempted to stop the bleeding in vain nero's final words were too late this is fidelity he died on 9 june 68 the anniversary of the death of octavia and was buried in the mausoleum of the domitii ahenobarbi in what is now the villa borghese pincian hill area of rome
with his death the julio-claudian dynasty ended the senate when news of his death reached rome posthumously declared nero a public enemy to appease the coming galba as the senate had initially declared galba as a public enemy and proclaimed galba the new emperor chaos would ensue in the year of the four emperors
according to suetonius and cassius dio the people of rome celebrated the death of nero tacitus though describes a more complicated political environment tacitus mentions that nero's death was welcomed by senators nobility and the upper class the lower-class slaves frequenters of the arena and the theater and those who were supported by the famous excesses of nero on the other hand were upset with the news members of the military were said to have mixed feelings as they had allegiance to nero but were bribed to overthrow him
eastern sources namely philostratus ii and apollonius of tyana mention that nero's death was mourned as he restored the liberties of hellas with a wisdom and moderation quite alien to his character and that he held our liberties in his hand and respected them
modern scholarship generally holds that while the senate and more well-off individuals welcomed nero's death the general populace was loyal to the end and beyond for otho and vitellius both thought it worthwhile to appeal to their nostalgia
nero's name was erased from some monuments in what edward champlin regards as an outburst of private zeal many portraits of nero were reworked to represent other figures according to eric r. varner over fifty such images survive this reworking of images is often explained as part of the way in which the memory of disgraced emperors was condemned posthumously see damnatio memoriae champlin however doubts that the practice is necessarily negative and notes that some continued to create images of nero long after his death
the civil war during the year of the four emperors was described by ancient historians as a troubling period according to tacitus this instability was rooted in the fact that emperors could no longer rely on the perceived legitimacy of the imperial bloodline as nero and those before him could galba began his short reign with the execution of many allies of nero and possible future enemies one such notable enemy included nymphidius sabinus who claimed to be the son of emperor caligula
otho overthrew galba otho was said to be liked by many soldiers because he had been a friend of nero's and resembled him somewhat in temperament it was said that the common roman hailed otho as nero himself otho used nero as a surname and reerected many statues to nero vitellius overthrew otho vitellius began his reign with a large funeral for nero complete with songs written by nero
after nero's suicide in 68 there was a widespread belief especially in the eastern provinces that he was not dead and somehow would return this belief came to be known as the nero redivivus legend
the legend of nero's return lasted for hundreds of years after nero's death augustine of hippo wrote of the legend as a popular belief in 422
at least three nero imposters emerged leading rebellions the first who sang and played the cithara or lyre and whose face was similar to that of the dead emperor appeared in 69 during the reign of vitellius after persuading some to recognize him he was captured and executed sometime during the reign of titus 79–81 another impostor appeared in asia and sang to the accompaniment of the lyre and looked like nero but he too was killed twenty years after nero's death during the reign of domitian there was a third pretender he was supported by the parthians who only reluctantly gave him up and the matter almost came to war
in his book the lives of the twelve caesars suetonius describes nero as about the average height his body marked with spots and malodorous his hair light blonde his features regular rather than attractive his eyes blue and somewhat weak his neck over thick his belly prominent and his legs very slender
the history of nero's reign is problematic in that no historical sources survived that were contemporary with nero these first histories at one time did exist and were described as biased and fantastical either overly critical or praising of nero the original sources were also said to contradict on a number of events nonetheless these lost primary sources were the basis of surviving secondary and tertiary histories on nero written by the next generations of historians a few of the contemporary historians are known by name fabius rusticus cluvius rufus and pliny the elder all wrote condemning histories on nero that are now lost there were also pro-nero histories but it is unknown who wrote them or for what deeds nero was praised
the bulk of what is known of nero comes from tacitus suetonius and cassius dio who were all of the senatorial class tacitus and suetonius wrote their histories on nero over fifty years after his death while cassius dio wrote his history over 150 years after nero's death these sources contradict on a number of events in nero's life including the death of claudius the death of agrippina and the roman fire of 64 but they are consistent in their condemnation of nero
a handful of other sources also add a limited and varying perspective on nero few surviving sources paint nero in a favourable light some sources though portray him as a competent emperor who was popular with the roman people especially in the east
cassius dio
cassius dio c 155–229 was the son of cassius apronianus a roman senator he passed the greater part of his life in public service he was a senator under commodus and governor of smyrna after the death of septimius severus and afterwards suffect consul around 205 and also proconsul in africa and pannonia
books 61–63 of dio's roman history describe the reign of nero only fragments of these books remain and what does remain was abridged and altered by john xiphilinus an 11th-century monk
dio chrysostom
dio chrysostom c 40–120 a greek philosopher and historian wrote the roman people were very happy with nero and would have allowed him to rule indefinitely they longed for his rule once he was gone and embraced imposters when they appeared
indeed the truth about this has not come out even yet for so far as the rest of his subjects were concerned there was nothing to prevent his continuing to be emperor for all time seeing that even now everybody wishes he were still alive and the great majority do believe that he still is although in a certain sense he has died not once but often along with those who had been firmly convinced that he was still alive
epictetus
epictetus c 55–135 was the slave to nero's scribe epaphroditos he makes a few passing negative comments on nero's character in his work but makes no remarks on the nature of his rule he describes nero as a spoiled angry and unhappy man
josephus
the historian josephus c 37–100 while calling nero a tyrant was also the first to mention bias against nero of other historians he said
but i omit any further discourse about these affairs for there have been a great many who have composed the history of nero some of which have departed from the truth of facts out of favour as having received benefits from him while others out of hatred to him and the great ill-will which they bore him have so impudently raved against him with their lies that they justly deserve to be condemned nor do i wonder at such as have told lies of nero since they have not in their writings preserved the truth of history as to those facts that were earlier than his time even when the actors could have no way incurred their hatred since those writers lived a long time after them
lucan
though more of a poet than historian lucanus c 39–65 has one of the kindest accounts of nero's rule he writes of peace and prosperity under nero in contrast to previous war and strife ironically he was later involved in a conspiracy to overthrow nero and was executed
philostratus
philostratus ii the athenian c 172–250 spoke of nero in the life of apollonius tyana books 4–5 though he has a generally bad or dim view of nero he speaks of others'positive reception of nero in the east
pliny the elder
the history of nero by pliny the elder c 24–79 did not survive still there are several references to nero in pliny's natural histories pliny has one of the worst opinions of nero and calls him an enemy of mankind
plutarch
plutarch c 46–127 mentions nero indirectly in his account of the life of galba and the life of otho nero is portrayed as a tyrant but those that replace him are not described as better
seneca the younger
it is not surprising that seneca c 4 bc–65 nero's teacher and advisor writes very well of nero
suetonius
suetonius c 69–130 was a member of the equestrian order and he was the head of the department of the imperial correspondence while in this position suetonius started writing biographies of the emperors accentuating the anecdotal and sensational aspects
tacitus
the annals by tacitus c 56–117 is the most detailed and comprehensive history on the rule of nero despite being incomplete after the year 66 tacitus described the rule of the julio-claudian emperors as generally unjust he also thought that existing writing on them was unbalanced
the histories of tiberius caius claudius and nero while they were in power were falsified through terror and after their death were written under the irritation of a recent hatred
tacitus was the son of a procurator who married into the elite family of agricola he entered his political life as a senator after nero's death and by tacitus'own admission owed much to nero's rivals realising that this bias may be apparent to others tacitus protests that his writing is true
girolamo cardano
in 1562 girolamo cardano published in basel his encomium neronis which was one of the first historical references of the modern era to portray nero in a positive light
at the end of 66 conflict broke out between greeks and jews in jerusalem and caesarea according to the talmud nero went to jerusalem and shot arrows in all four directions all the arrows landed in the city he then asked a passing child to repeat the verse he had learned that day the child responded i will lay my vengeance upon edom by the hand of my people israel ez 25,14 nero became terrified believing that god wanted the temple in jerusalem to be destroyed but would punish the one to carry it out nero said he desires to lay waste his house and to lay the blame on me whereupon he fled and converted to judaism to avoid such retribution vespasian was then dispatched to put down the rebellion
the talmud adds that the sage reb meir baal haness rabbi meir or rabbi meir baal hanes rabbi meir the miracle maker was a jewish sage who lived in the time of the mishna a prominent supporter of the bar kokhba rebellion against roman rule he was considered one of the greatest of the tannaim of the third generation 139-163 according to the talmud his father was a descendant of the roman emperor nero who had converted to judaism his wife bruriah is one of the few women cited in the gemara he is the third most frequently mentioned sage in the mishnah
roman and greek sources nowhere report nero's alleged trip to jerusalem or his alleged conversion to judaism there is also no record of nero having any offspring who survived infancy his only recorded child claudia augusta died aged 4 months
non-christian historian tacitus describes nero extensively torturing and executing christians after the fire of 64 suetonius also mentions nero punishing christians though he does so because they are given to a new and mischievous superstition and does not connect it with the fire
christian writer tertullian c 155–230 was the first to call nero the first persecutor of christians he wrote examine your records there you will find that nero was the first that persecuted this doctrine lactantius c 240–320 also said that nero first persecuted the servants of god as does sulpicius severus however suetonius writes that since the jews constantly made disturbances at the instigation of chrestus he emperor claudius expelled them from rome iudaeos impulsore chresto assidue tumultuantis roma expulit these expelled jews may have been early christians although suetonius is not explicit nor is the bible explicit calling aquila of pontus and his wife priscilla both expelled from italy at the time jews
the first text to suggest that nero ordered the execution of an apostle is a letter by clement to the corinthians traditional dated to around 96 a.d. the apocryphal ascension of isaiah a christian writing from the 2nd century says the slayer of his mother who himself even this king will persecute the plant which the twelve apostles of the beloved have planted of the twelve one will be delivered into his hands was interpreted to mean nero
bishop eusebius of caesarea c 275–339 was the first to write explicitly that paul was beheaded in rome during the reign of nero he states that nero's persecution led to peter and paul's deaths but that nero did not give any specific orders however several other accounts going back to the 1st century have paul surviving his two years in rome and travelling to hispania before facing trial in rome again prior to his death
peter is first said to have been crucified upside-down in rome during nero's reign but not by nero in the apocryphal acts of peter c 200 the account ends with paul still alive and nero abiding by god's command not to persecute any more christians
by the 4th century a number of writers were stating that nero killed peter and paul
the sibylline oracles book 5 and 8 written in the 2nd century speak of nero returning and bringing destruction within christian communities these writings along with others fueled the belief that nero would return as the antichrist in 310 lactantius wrote that nero suddenly disappeared and even the burial place of that noxious wild beast was nowhere to be seen this has led some persons of extravagant imagination to suppose that having been conveyed to a distant region he is still reserved alive and to him they apply the sibylline verses lactantius maintains that it is not right to believe this
in 422 augustine of hippo wrote about 2 thessalonians 2 1–11 where he believed paul mentioned the coming of the antichrist though he rejects the theory augustine mentions that many christians believed that nero was the antichrist or would return as the antichrist he wrote so that in saying ,'for the mystery of iniquity doth already work ,'he alluded to nero whose deeds already seemed to be as the deeds of antichrist
some modern biblical scholars such as delbert hillers johns hopkins university of the american schools of oriental research and the editors of the oxford harper collins study bibles contend that the number 666 in the book of revelation is a code for nero a view that is also supported in roman catholic biblical commentaries
the concept of nero as the antichrist is often a central belief of preterist eschatology
manila məˈnɪl.ə is the capital city of the philippines founded on june 24 1571 by spanish conquistador miguel lópez de legazpi it is one of the oldest cities in the country and was the seat of power for most of the colonial rules of the philippines it is situated on the eastern shore of manila bay and contains a multitude of landmarks some of which date back to the 16th century such as the spanish colonial era walled city of intramuros
manila is the second most populous city in the philippines after the former capital quezon city with a population of 1,780,148 in 2015 because of its small land area and huge population manila is regarded as one of the most densely populated cities in the world with 42,857 people per square kilometer manila is one of the sixteen cities and a municipality that make up metro manila the national capital region of the philippines in 2012 globalization and world cities research network listed manila as a global city

in 1571 spanish conquistadors arrived from mexico from across the pacific and founded present-day manila in what today is intramuros spanish missionaries soon christianized the city and incorporated tondo under manila and then built some of the oldest churches in the country including san agustin church the conquistadors renamed the area nuevo reino de castilla new kingdom of castille and shortened the name to manila
manila became the center of spanish activity in the far east and one end of the manila-acapulco galleon trade route linking spanish america with asia one of the earliest examples of globalization due to the central location in the pacific sea trade routes manila received the moniker of the pearl of the orient spanish rule of manila and the entire philippine archipelago lasted for over three centuries until 1898 at different times during the long spanish period there were local revolts chinese insurrections massive pirate attacks great earthquakes dutch raids and invasion attempts and a british occupation of the city during their unsuccessful attempt to conquer the philippines order was usually quickly restored and the city returned to the business of trade in the 19th century manila was one of the most modern cities in asia before the spanish–american war manila saw the rise of the philippine revolution under the american rule following the spanish–american war the united states changed the official language from spanish to english and made some changes in education local laws and urban planning towards the end of world war ii during the battle of manila most of the city was flattened by intensive aerial bombardment by the united states air force as a result relatively little remains of manila's prewar and colonial architecture although there are ongoing restoration projects especially within the old walled city intramuros
the earliest evidence of human life in and around the area of manila is the nearby angono petroglyphs dated to around 3000 bc furthermore negritos a class of australoid peoples became the aboriginal inhabitants of the philippines they were found across luzon before the malayo-polynesians migrated in and assimilated them
the kingdom of tondo flourished during the latter half of the ming dynasty as a result of direct trade relations with china tondo district was maintained as the traditional capital of the empire with its rulers as sovereign kings and not mere chieftains and were addressed variously as panginuan ln meranau or panginoón in tagalog lords anák banwa son of heaven or lakandula lord of the palace the emperor of china considered the lakans rulers of ancient manila 王 kings
in the 13th century manila consisted of a fortified settlement and trading quarter at the shores of the pasig river on top of previous older towns manila was then settled by the indianized empire of majapahit as referenced in the epic eulogy poem nagarakretagama which inscribed its conquest by maharaja hayam wuruk selurong ेलुरन ् ग ् which is a historical name for the city of manila is listed in canto 14 alongside sulot which is now sulu and kalka
during the reign of sultan bolkiah from 1485 to 1521 the bruneian empire invaded wanting to take advantage of tondo's china trade by attacking its environs and establishing كوتا سلودو kota saludong the kingdom of maynila they ruled under and gave yearly tribute to the sultanate of brunei as its satellite state they established a new dynasty under the local leader who accepted islam and became rajah salalila or tariq sulayman i. he also established a trading challenge to the already rich house of lakan dula in tondo islam was further strengthened by the arrival of muslim traders from the arab-indian area and southeast asia manila was temporarily besieged by the invasion of chinese pirate-warlord limahong 1574 but was thwarted by the local inhabitants before it became the seat of the colonial government of spain
on june 24 1571 spanish conquistador miguel lópez de legazpi arrived from new spain now mexico and then exercised rule of the spanish city of manila as a territory of new spain with the establishment of a city council in what today is the district of intramuros lópez de legazpi had the local royalty executed or exiled after the failure of the tondo conspiracy a plot wherein an alliance between japanese merchants luzon's huangs with several datus and rajahs plus the bruneian empire would band together to execute the spaniards and their latin-american mercenaries and visayan allies at the conclusion of which the victorious spaniards made manila the capital of the spanish east indies and of the philippines which the empire would control for the next three centuries from 1565 to 1898
manila then became famous during the manila-acapulco galleon trade which lasted for three centuries and brought goods from europe africa and latin america across the pacific islands to southeast asia which was already an entrepot for goods coming from india indonesia and china and trade also flowed vice versa silver that was mined in mexico and peru were exchanged for chinese silk indian gems and the spices of the southeast asia some of which even flowed to europe likewise wines and olives grown from europe and north africa were transshipped via mexico towards manila
manila was occupied by british forces for twenty months from 1762 to 1764 and used as a base for an unsuccessful attempt to conquer the philippines during the seven years'war eventually the british withdrew from manila as per agreements in the 1763 treaty of paris the chinese were punished for supporting the british invasion and the small fortress-city of intramuros mostly populated by europeans and mexicans kept its cannons pointed at binondo the world's oldest chinatown
mexican independence in 1821 necessitated direct rule from spain under direct spanish rule banking industry and education flourished more than it had in the previous two centuries the opening of the suez canal in 1869 facilitated direct trade and communications with spain
the growing wealth and education attracted indigenous chinese indians latinos and europeans from the provinces to manila all of whom elected a nascent filipino citizenship regardless of ethnicity the developments also facilitated the rise of an illustrado class which espoused liberal ideas the ideological foundations of the philippine revolution which sought independence from spain
after the battle of manila 1898 spain ceded the surrendered city of manila to the united states the first philippine republic based at nearby bulacan fought against the americans for control of the city of manila the americans defeated the first philippine republic and captured president emilio aguinaldo who announced allegiance to the united states on april 1 1901
upon drafting a new charter for manila in june 1901 the americans made official what had long been tacit that the city of manila was not intramuros alone but also all its arrabales the new city charter proclaimed that manila was composed of eleven municipal districts — presumably tondo binondo santa cruz sampaloc san miguel pandacan santa ana paco malate ermita and intramuros in addition to these the church recognized five parishes as manileno — namely gagalangin trozo balic-balic santa mesa and singalong later times would add two more balut and san andres bukid
under american control a new civilian oriented insular government headed by then governor-general william howard taft invited city planner daniel burnham for the transformation of manila to adapt the old city to changed times and modern needs the burnham plan included development of the road system the use of waterways for transportation and beautification of manila with the improvement of waterfronts construction of parks parkways and various building for various activities
the latter included a government center occupying all of wallace field which extends from luneta to the present taft avenue the philippine capitol was to rise at the taft avenue end of the field facing toward the sea and would form with the buildings of different government bureaus and departments a quadrangle lagoon in the center and a monument to josé rizal at its luneta end of burnham's proposed government center only three units — the legislative building and the building of the finance and agricultural departments — were completed when world war ii erupted

attalea is a large genus of palms native to mexico the caribbean central and south america this pinnately leaved non-spiny genus includes both small palms lacking an aboveground stem and large trees the genus has a complicated taxonomic history and has often been split into four or five genera based on differences in the male flowers since the genera can only be distinguished on the basis of their male flowers the existence of intermediate flower types and the existence of hybrids between different genera has been used as an argument for keeping them all in the same genus this has been supported by a recent molecular phylogeny
somewhere between 29 and 67 species are recognised in the genus with estimates of as many as 100 incomplete herbarium collections make it difficult to determine whether certain groups represent single species or groups of similar species attalea species have a long history of human use and include economically important sources of palm oil and fibre many species are fire tolerant and thrive in disturbed habitats their seeds are animal dispersed including some which are thought to have been adapted for dispersal by now-extinct pleistocene megafauna
the genus attalea has pinnately compound leaves — rows of leaflets emerge on either side of the axis of the leaf in a feather-like or fern-like pattern species are also non-spiny palms and includes both large trees with stout stems up to 30 metres 98 ft tall and acaulescent palms one which lack an aboveground stem the number of leaves per individual varies from about three to thirty-five larger plants tend to have more and longer leaves
inflorescences are large branched and borne among the leaves the inflorescence consists of a main axis — the peduncle and the rachis — and a series of smaller branches the rachillae the rachillae which bear the flowers emerge from the rachis the peduncle is the main stalk connecting the rachis with the stem inflorescences either consist entirely of male flowers or are predominantly female with a few male flowers fruit usually have two or three seeds although fewer or more are present in some species and are usually brown yellow orange-brown or purple when mature
four different types of male flowers exist on the basis of these flower types the genus has often been split into four genera — a more narrowly defined attalea orbignya maximiliana and scheelea the species sometimes referred to orbignya have coiled anthers while the other groups have straight ones the petals of those placed in maximiliana are much shorter than the stamens while those placed in scheelea and a more narrowly defined attalea have petals that are longer than the stamens five species do not fit easily into any of these groups this fact has been used as an argument in favour of considering this group a single genus
attalea has been placed in the subfamily arecoideae the tribe cocoseae and the subtribe attaleinae together with the genera allagoptera beccariophoenix butia cocos jubaea jubaeopsis lytocaryum parajubaea syagrus and voanioala within this subtribe attalea has been found to be a monophyletic group and sister to the clade containing allagoptera polyandrococos parajubaea butia and jubaea
disagreement exists as to whether attalea should be considered a single genus or a group of related genera in their 1996 field guide to the palms of the americas andrew henderson gloria galeano and rodrigo bernal combined all the species in the subtribe attaleinae as it was then defined into a single genus attalea in his 1999 taxonomic treatment of palm subtribe attaleinae american botanist sidney f. glassman divided the group into five genera — a more narrowly defined attalea orbignya maximiliana scheelea and ynesa rafäel govaerts and john dransfield recognised a single genus in their 2005 world checklist of palms and jean-christophe pintaud continued this usage in his 2008 review of the genus
the multi-genus approach is based solely on the structure of the male flowers no other characters could be consistently associated with one genus or another four of the genera — attalea in a narrow sense orbignya maximiliana and scheelea — correspond to four different types of male flowers found within the genus however a few species have flowers that are intermediate between these four types including a. colenda which glassman placed in its own genus ynesa and this has been used as an argument for the single-genus approach in addition there are several hybrids between species that would be considered different genera under glassman's five-genus system which has also been used as an argument for placing them in a single genus in 2009 alan meerow and colleagues published a molecular phylogeny of the subtribe which found that some species placed in orbignya were actually more closely related to species placed in scheelea than they were to other members of that genus if the five-genus approach was used while a. crassispatha placed in orbignya by glassman was actually a sister to both scheelea and orbignya
the genus attalea was first described carl sigismund kunth in 1816 based on specimens collected by alexander von humboldt and aimé bonpland although older pre-linnaean descriptions exist including charles plumier's 1703 description of a. crassispatha the genus was named for attalus iii philometor king of pergamon known for his interest in medicinal plants the type species is a. amygdalina a colombian endemic the genera maximiliana and orbignya were described by carl friedrich philipp von martius in 1826 and 1837 respectively scheelea was described by hermann karsten in 1857 and ynesa by orator f. cook in 1942
experts disagree about the number of species in the genus attalea broadly defined in 1965 dutch taxonomist jan gerard wessels boer estimated that there may be as many as 100 species in the genus in their 1996 field guide to the palms of the americas andrew henderson and coauthors recognised 29 species in the genus while sidney glassman recognised 65 species in his 1999 treatment of the group largely following glassman's lead rafaël govaerts and john dransfield recognised 67 species in their 2005 world checklist of palms an important element of this disagreement is the decision by glassman to define species more narrowly than henderson as a result what henderson interpreted as variation within species glassman took as differences between morphologically similar species this problem is complicated by the fact that many of these species are poorly represented in herbarium collections the large size of the leaves inflorescences and fruit of many attalea species makes them difficult to collect in addition many important collections including type specimen have been lost or destroyed sparse or incomplete collections make it difficult to differentiate variation within a single species from variation between different species
the three recent treatments henderson and coauthors glassman and govaerts and dransfield recognised a total of 73 species but only 20 species are accepted by all of them the remainder account for either nine species or more than 40 for example what andrew henderson considered a single species attalea attaleoides other authors have considered a species complex consisting of four or five species glassman doubted the validity of a. attaleoides as a species and described four new species from material that had previously been attributed to a. attaleoides — a. camopiensis a. degranvillei a. guianensis and a. maripensis govaerts and dransfield accepted both glassman's four species and a. attaleoides however jean-christophe pintaud was of the opinion that a. guianensis a. maripensis and a. attaleoides were all very similar and thought it likely that they all represented the same species
another species complex in attalea includes a. speciosa and related species henderson 1995 recognised a. speciosa and a. spectabilis considering the latter to either be an acaulescent form of a. speciosa or a hybrid between it and a. microcarpa govaerts and dransfield accepted a. spectabilis but glassman considered it a dubious taxon attalea vitrivir was recognised as a distinct species by michael balick and coauthors glassman and govaerts and dransfield concurred but henderson considered it part of a. speciosa glassman also described a fourth member of this group a. brejinhoensis and it is accepted by govaerts and dransfield
attalea species are monoecious — male and female flowers are separate but are borne by the same plant various species have been described as being insect-pollinated including a. phalerata while pollination in a. colenda and a. speciosa has been attributed both to insects and wind
seed germination is remote tubular — during germination as the cotyledon expands it pushes the young shoot away from the seed after germination the stem initially grows downward before turning to grow upward and produce the aboveground stem this produces a saxophone shaped belowground portion of the stem the fact that the shoot tips of attalea seedlings are underground it likely to contribute to their fire-tolerance
species range across the neotropics from mexico in the north to bolivia paraguay and southern brazil in the south according to govaerts and coauthors three species are found in mexico four in central america and 62 in south america three species are present in the caribbean — two in trinidad and tobago along the southern edge of the region and one in haiti
attalea includes both large trees and small acaulescent palms which occupy a number of different ecological niches dense stands of some of the larger species are conspicuous elements on the landscape while smaller species are found in both in the forest understorey and in savannas
disturbance has been implicated in the formation of vegetation dominated by large attalea species in seasonally dry amazonian forests the density of large adult a. maripa palms was correlated with canopy openness the species also dominates savannas formed by repeated forest fires in trinidad and tobago attalea speciosa forms pure stands in many parts of brazil where natural forest vegetation has been cleared similarly stands of a. funifera in bahia brazil which are cultivated for piassava fibre are managed using fire — the seedlings survive cutting and burning and are able to dominate burned forest patches
the fruit are dispersed by animals fruit which are not dispersed frequently suffer seed predation by bruchid beetles certain species of attalea have been mentioned as examples of anachronistic species which are adapted for dispersal by now-extinct pleistocene megafauna on maracá island roraima in the brazilian amazon attalea maripa fruit were consumed by tapirs collared peccaries deer and primates rodents including agoutis fed upon the fruit and as the fruit availability declined they fed on the seeds other dispersers of attalea fruit include crested caracaras which consume the fruit and disperse the seeds of a. phalerata in the brazilian pantanal
attalea species have a long history of human utilisation carbonised attalea maripa seeds have been found in archaeological sites in colombia dating back to 9000 bp a variety of species remain important sources of edible oil thatch edible seeds and fibre the leaves of attalea butyracea and a. maripa are used extensively for thatching several species are oil palms with a. speciosa among the most important economically products extracted from a. speciosa were reported to support over 300,000 households in the brazilian state of maranhão in 2005 and in 1985 it was estimated to support over 450,000 households throughout the brazil piassava fibres extracted from the leaf bases of a. funifera are commercially important and generated about us 20 million in annual income to brazilian farmers in 1996
the heart of ezra greer is a 1917 american silent drama film produced by the thanhouser company and directed by emile chautard the film focuses on ezra greer a successful middle-aged man who searches for his college age daughter mary the wayward mary was romanced and abandoned by jack denbeigh later bearing his child once ezra becomes broke he finds employment as the valet for jack denbeigh after jack's engagement to a cabaret girl mary becomes upset and leaves her child at jack's home contrary to jack's wishes ezra keeps the child and jack ultimately reveals that the child is his own ezra convinces jack to make things right and ezra convinces the cabaret girl to leave jack after a carriage accident in which the baby is injured ezra and jack rush to the hospital and find mary as a nurse crying over the child the film ends with the marriage of jack and mary the film was released by pathé on october 7 1917 the film was the final release from thanhouser and was deemed to be an average film by most reviewers criticism for the film hinged on far-fetched coincidences to drive the plot the film is presumed lost
the film follows ezra greer a middle-aged man who has worked hard since his youth he cares deeply for his motherless daughter mary but was unable to attend the annual commencement at her co-educational college he awaits for her to return from college but mary leaves with her romantic interest jack denbeigh on promise of marriage and wealth mary is romanced and gives birth to a fatherless child without word from his daughter ezra resigns from his job and attempts to seek her out and finds a poor motherless child marie with ezra's money exhausted he seeks employment and finds it as the valet of jack

the film was the final production and release of the thanhouser company and it was to be released through pathé numerous factors would play into the winding down and eventual closing of the thanhouser film corporation with much advance notice by edwin thanhouser q. david bowers writes that it was easy to understand thanhouser's decision to retire due to numerous aspects including that releases through pathé were based on their decision to release or discard the work the new rochelle studio was 2,500 miles from the center of the trade activity and the slump in industry tied to world war i. weeks before the film was released variety told of the winding down of the thanhouser with the studio's staff consisting of edwin thanhouser and the bookkeeper jessie b. bishop the article concluded with the announcement that lloyd f. lonergan the scenario writer of the company had retired from the company as it wound down the thanhouser company was announced to have no liabilities would close with a positive bank balance little is known of the production of this final film but it was directed by emile chautard from a scenario written by lloyd f. lonergan the cameraman was jacques bizeul
the five reel film was released through the pathé exchange as a pathé gold rooster play on october 7 1917 charles e. wagner of the exhibitor's trade review found it to be a good film with great direction and photography but was concerned that the stunt in which the baby appeared to be involved in the accident was too real wagner stated the film had sufficient action and pathos without sexual suggestiveness which should prove a strong program for the pathé program frances agnew of the morning telegraph found it to be an average picture that was not exceptional for audiences but it would hold sentimental appeal for the average viewer a reviewer for the the new york dramatic mirror found the film's excessive use of coincidental meetings to be highly improbable but found warde's performance to be excellent and the rest of the cast give good performances the reviewer said that emile chautard had made the improbable story more plausible
like many american films of the time the heart of ezra greer was subject to cuts by city and state film censorship boards the chicago board of censors required the cutting in reel 2 of a letter stating i cannot face my father etc and two closeups of gambling scenes and in reel 5 a change of the intertitle because it means her whole future to because she is his wife
free derry irish saor dhoire was a self-declared autonomous nationalist area of derry northern ireland that existed between 1969 and 1972 its name was taken from a sign painted on a gable wall in the bogside in january 1969 which read you are now entering free derry the area which included the bogside and creggan neighbourhoods was secured by community activists for the first time on 5 january 1969 following an incursion into the bogside by members of the royal ulster constabulary ruc residents built barricades and carried clubs and similar arms to prevent the ruc from entering after six days the residents took down the barricades and ruc patrols resumed but tensions remained high over the following months
violence reached a peak on 12 august 1969 culminating in the battle of the bogside — a three-day pitched battle between residents and the ruc on 14 august units of the british army were deployed at the edge of the bogside and the ruc were withdrawn the derry citizens defence association dcda declared their intention to hold the area against both the ruc and the british army until their demands were met the british army made no attempt to enter the area the situation continued until october 1969 when following publication of the hunt report military police were allowed in
the irish republican army ira began to re-arm and recruit after august 1969 in december 1969 it split into the official ira and the provisional ira both were supported by the people of the free derry area meanwhile relations between the british army and the nationalist community which were initially good deteriorated in july 1971 there was a surge of recruitment into the ira after two young men were shot and killed by british troops the government introduced internment on 9 august 1971 and in response barricades went up once more in the bogside and creggan this time free derry was a no-go area defended by armed members of both the official and provisional ira from within the area they launched attacks on the british army and the provisionals began a bombing campaign in the city centre as before unarmed'auxiliaries'manned the barricades and crime was dealt with by a voluntary body known as the free derry police
support for the ira increased further after bloody sunday in january 1972 when thirteen unarmed men and boys were shot dead by the british army's parachute regiment at a march in the bogside a 14th man was wounded and died 4 ½ months later the support began to wane after the killing by the official ira of a local youth who was home on leave from the british army after a provisional ira ceasefire during which it entered talks with the british government broke down the british took the decision to move against the no-go areas free derry came to an end on 31 july 1972 when thousands of british troops moved in with armoured cars and bulldozers to occupy the area
derry city lies near the border between northern ireland and the republic of ireland it has a majority nationalist population and nationalists won a majority of seats in the 1920 local elections despite this the ulster unionist party controlled the local council londonderry corporation from 1923 onwards the unionists maintained their majority firstly by manipulating the constituency boundaries gerrymandering so that the south ward with a nationalist majority returned eight councillors while the much smaller north ward and waterside ward with unionist majorities returned twelve councillors between them secondly by allowing only ratepayers to vote in local elections rather than one man one vote so that a higher number of nationalists who did not own homes were disenfranchised and thirdly by denying houses to nationalists outside the south ward constituency the result was that there were about 2,000 nationalist families and practically no unionists on the housing waiting list and that housing in the nationalist area was crowded and of a very poor condition the south ward comprised the bogside brandywell creggan bishop street and foyle road and it was this area that would become free derry
the derry housing action committee dhac was formed in march 1968 by members of the derry branch of the northern ireland labour party and the james connolly republican club including eamonn mccann and eamon melaugh it disrupted a meeting of londonderry corporation in march 1968 and in may blocked traffic by placing a caravan that was home to a family of four in the middle of the lecky road in the bogside and staging a sit-down protest at the opening of the second deck of the craigavon bridge after the meeting of londonderry corporation was again disrupted in august eamon melaugh telephoned the northern ireland civil rights association nicra and invited them to hold a march in derry the date chosen was 5 october 1968 an adhoc committee was formed although in reality most of the organizing was done by mccann and melaugh and the route was to take the marchers inside the city walls where nationalists were traditionally not permitted to march the minister of home affairs william craig made an order on 3 october prohibiting the march on the grounds that the apprentice boys of derry were intending to hold a march on the same day in the words of martin melaugh of cain this particular tactic ... provided the excuse needed to ban the march when the marchers attempted to defy the ban on 5 october they were stopped by a royal ulster constabulary ruc cordon the police drew their batons and struck marchers including stormont mp eddie mcateer and westminster mp gerry fitt subsequently the police broke ranks and used their batons indiscriminately on people in duke street marchers trying to escape met another party of police and these police also used their batons indiscriminately water cannons were also used the police action caused outrage in the nationalist area of derry and at a meeting four days later the derry citizens'action committee dcac was formed with john hume as chairman and ivan cooper as vice-chairman
another group formed as a result of the events of 5 october was people's democracy a group of students in queen's university belfast they organised a march from belfast to derry in support of civil rights starting out with about forty young people on 1 january 1969 the march met with violent opposition from loyalist counter-demonstrators at several points along the route finally at burntollet bridge five miles outside derry they were attacked by a mob of about two hundred wielding clubs — some of them studded with nails — and stones half of the attackers were later identified from press photographs as members of the b-specials the police who were at the scene chatted to the b-specials as they prepared their ambush and then failed to protect the marchers many of whom ran into the river and were pelted with stones from the bank dozens of marchers were taken to hospital the remainder continued on to derry where they were attacked once more on their way to craigavon bridge before they finally reached guildhall square where they held a rally rioting broke out after the rally police drove rioters into the bogside but did not come after them in the early hours of the following morning 5 january members of the ruc charged into st. columb's wells and lecky road in the bogside breaking windows and beating residents in his report on the disturbances lord cameron remarked that for such conduct among members of a disciplined and well-led force there can be no acceptable justification or excuse and added that its effect in rousing passions and inspiring hostility towards the police was regrettably great
that afternoon over 1,500 bogside residents built barricades armed themselves with steel bars wooden clubs and hurleys and told the police that they would not be allowed into the area dcac chairman john hume told a meeting of residents that they were to defend the area and no-one was to come in groups of men wearing armbands patrolled the streets in shifts john'caker'casey a local activist painted you are now entering free derry in white paint on the gable wall of a house on the corner of lecky road and fahan street that corner which was a popular venue for meetings later became known as free derry corner on 7 january the barricaded area was extended to include the creggan another nationalist area on a hill overlooking the bogside a clandestine radio station calling itself radio free derry began broadcasting to residents playing rebel songs and encouraging resistance on a small number of occasions law-breakers attempted crimes but were dealt with by the patrols despite all this the irish times reported that the infrastructure of revolutionary control in the area has not been developed beyond the maintenance of patrols following some acts of destruction and of violence late in the week members of the dcac including ivan cooper addressed residents on friday 10 january and called on them to dismantle the barricades the barricades were taken down the following morning
over the next three months there were violent clashes with local youths throwing stones at police violence came to a head on saturday 19 april after a planned march from burntollet bridge to the city centre was banned a protest in the city centre led to clashes with paisleyites — unionists in sympathy with the anti-civil rights stance of ian paisley police attempting to drive the protesters back into the bogside were themselves driven back to their barracks a series of pitched battles followed and barricades were built often under the supervision of bernadette devlin newly elected mp for mid ulster police pursuing rioters broke into a house in william street and severely beat the occupant samuel devenny his family and two friends devenny was brought to hospital bleeding profusely from a number of head wounds at midnight four hundred ruc men in full riot gear and carrying riot shields occupied the bogside convoys of police vehicles drove through the area with headlights blazing
the following day several thousand residents led by the dcac withdrew to the creggan and issued an ultimatum to the ruc — withdraw within two hours or be driven out with fifteen minutes of the two hours remaining the police marched out through the butcher's gate even as the residents were entering from the far side the barricades were not maintained on this occasion and routine patrols were not prevented
samuel devenny suffered a heart attack four days after his beating on 17 july he suffered a further heart attack and died thousands attended his funeral and the mood was sufficiently angry that it was clear the annual apprentice boys'parade scheduled for 12 august could not take place without causing serious disturbance
the apprentice boys'parade is an annual celebration by unionists of the relief of the siege of derry in 1689 which began when thirteen young apprentice boys shut the city's gates against the army of king james at that time the parade was held on 12 august each year participants from across northern ireland and britain marched along the city walls above the bogside and were often openly hostile to the residents on 30 july 1969 the derry citizens defence association dcda was formed to try to preserve peace during the period of the parade and to defend the bogside and creggan in the event of an attack the chairman was seán keenan an irish republican army ira veteran the vice-chairman was paddy doherty a popular local man sometimes known as paddy bogside and the secretary was johnnie white another leading republican and leader of the james connolly republican club street committees were formed under the overall command of the dcda and barricades were built on the night of 11 august the parade took place as planned on 12 august as it passed through waterloo place on the edge of the bogside hostilities began between supporters and opponents of the parade fighting between the two groups continued for two hours then the police joined in they charged up william street against the bogsiders followed by the'paisleyites'. they were met with a hail of stones and petrol bombs the ensuing battle became known as the battle of the bogside late in the evening having been driven back repeatedly the police fired canisters of cs gas into the crowd youths on the roof of a high-rise block of flats on rossville street threw petrol bombs down on the police walkie-talkies were used to maintain contact between different areas of fighting and dcda headquarters in paddy doherty's house in westland street and first aid stations were operating staffed by doctors nurses and volunteers women and girls made milk-bottle crates of petrol bombs for supply to the youths in the front line and radio free derry broadcast to the fighters and their families on the third day of fighting 14 august the northern ireland government mobilised the ulster special constabulary b-specials a force greatly feared by nationalists in derry and elsewhere before they engaged however british troops were deployed at the scene carrying automatic rifles and sub-machine guns the ruc and b-specials withdrew and the troops took up positions outside the barricaded area
a deputation that included eamonn mccann met senior army officers and told them that the army would not be allowed in until certain demands were met including the disarming of the ruc the disbandment of the b-specials and the abolition of stormont the parliament and government of northern ireland the officers agreed that neither troops nor police would enter the bogside and creggan districts a'peace corps'was formed to maintain law and order when the british home secretary jim callaghan visited northern ireland and announced his intention to visit the bogside on 28 august he was told that he would not be allowed to bring either police or soldiers with him callaghan agreed accompanied by members of the defence committee he was swept along by a surging crowd of thousands up rossvile street and into lecky road where he took refuge in a local house and later addressed crowds from an upstairs window in preparation for callaghan's visit the free derry wall was painted white and the you are now entering free derry sign was professionally re-painted in black lettering
following callaghan's visit some barricades were breached but the majority remained while the people awaited concrete evidence of reform still the army made no move to enter the area law and order was maintained by a'peace corps'— volunteers organised by the dcda to patrol the streets and man the barricades there was very little crime punishment in the words of eamonn mccann as often as not consisted of a stern lecture from seán keenan on the need for solidarity within the area in september the barricades were replaced with a white line painted on the road
the hunt report on the future of policing in northern ireland was presented to the stormont cabinet in early october jim callaghan held talks with the cabinet in belfast on 10 october following which the report's recommendations were accepted and made public they included the recommendation that the ruc should be'ordinarily'unarmed and that the b-specials should be phased out and replaced by a new force the new ruc chief constable arthur young an englishman was announced and travelled to belfast with callaghan the same day seán keenan announced that the dcda was to be dissolved on 11 october callaghan and young visited free derry and on 12 october the first military police entered the bogside on foot and unarmed
the irish republican army ira had been inactive militarily since the end of the border campaign in 1962 it was low in both personnel and equipment — chief of staff cathal goulding told seán keenan and paddy doherty in august 1969 that he couldn 't defend the bogside i haven 't the men nor the guns to do it during the 1960s the leadership of the republican movement had moved to the left its focus was on class struggle and its aim was to unite the irish nationalist and unionist working classes in order to overthrow capitalism both british and irish republican clubs were formed in northern ireland where sinn féin was proscribed these clubs were involved in the formation of nicra in 1967 in derry the james connolly republican club worked closely with labour party radicals with whom they set up the derry housing action committee and derry unemployed action committee the derry citizens'defence association was formed initially by republicans who then invited other nationalists to join although there were tensions between the younger leaders like johnnie white and the older traditional republicans such as seán keenan both sides saw the unrest of 1968-69 as a chance to advance republican aims and the two shared the platform at the easter rising commemoration in april 1969
the events of august 1969 in derry and more particularly in belfast where the ira was unable to prevent loss of life or protect families burned out of their homes brought to a head the divisions that had already appeared within the movement between the radicals and the traditionalists and led to a split in december 1969 into the official ira and the provisional ira initially both armies organised for defensive purposes only although the provisionals were planning towards an offensive campaign in derry there was far less hostility between the two organisations than elsewhere and householders commonly paid subscriptions to both when rioters were arrested after the official's easter parade in march 1970 officials and provisionals picketed their trial together at the start the officials attracted most of the younger members martin mcguinness who in august 1969 had helped defend the barricades initially joined the officials but a few months later left to join the provisionals
relations between the british army and the residents had steadily decayed since the first appearance of troops in august 1969 in september after clashes between nationalist and unionist crowds that led to the death of a protestant man william king the british army erected a'peace ring'to enclose the nationalist population in the area they had previously controlled roads into the city centre were closed at night and people were prevented from walking on certain streets although some moderate nationalists accepted this as necessary there was anger among young people clashes between youths and troops became more frequent the riot following the officials'easter parade in march 1970 marked the first time that the army used'snatch squads', who rushed into the bogside wielding batons to make arrests the snatch squads soon became a common feature of army arrest operations there was also a belief that they were arresting people at random sometimes days after the alleged offence and based on the identification of people that they had seen from a considerable distance the rioters were condemned as hooligans by moderates who saw the riots as hampering attempts to resolve the situation the labour radicals and official republicans still working together tried to turn the youth away from rioting and create socialist organizations — one such organization was named the young hooligans association — but to no avail the provisionals while disapproving of riots viewed them as the inevitable consequence of british occupation this philosophy was more attractive to rioters and some of them joined the provisional ira the deaths of two leading provisionals in a premature explosion in june 1970 resulted in young militants becoming more prominent in the organization nevertheless up to july 1971 the provisional ira remained numerically small
two men séamas cusack and desmond beattie were shot dead in separate incidents in the early morning and afternoon of 8 july 1971 they were the first people to be killed by the british army in derry in both cases the british army claimed that the men were attacking them with guns or bombs while eyewitnesses insisted that both were unarmed the social democratic and labour party sdlp the newly formed party of which john hume and ivan cooper were leading members withdrew from stormont in protest but among residents there was a perception that moderate policies had failed the result was a surge of support for the ira the provisionals held a meeting the following sunday at which they called on people to join the ira following the meeting people queued up to join and there was large-scale rioting the british army post at bligh's lane came under sustained attack and troops there and around the city came under fire from the ira
the increasing violence in derry and elsewhere led to increasing speculation that internment without trial would be introduced in northern ireland and on 9 august 1971 hundreds of republicans and nationalists were arrested in dawn raids in derry residents came out onto the streets to resist the arrests and fewer people were taken there than elsewhere nevertheless leading figures including seán keenan and johnnie white were interned in response barricades were erected once again and the third free derry came into existence unlike its predecessors this free derry was marked by a strong ira presence both official and provisional it was defended by armed paramilitaries — a no-go area one in which british security forces were unable to operate
gun attacks on the british army increased six soldiers were wounded in the first day after internment and shortly afterwards a soldier was killed — the first to be killed by either ira in derry the army moved in in force on 18 august to dismantle the barricades a gun battle ensued in which a young provisional ira officer eamonn lafferty was killed a crowd staging a sit-down protest was hosed down and the protesters including john hume and ivan cooper arrested with barricades re-appearing as quickly as they were removed the army eventually abandoned their attempt
the derry provisionals had little contact with the ira elsewhere they had few weapons about twenty which they used mainly for sniping at the same time they launched their bombing campaign in derry unlike in belfast they were careful to avoid killing or injuring innocent people eamonn mccann wrote that the derry provos under martin mcguinness had managed to bomb the city centre until it looked as if it had been hit from the air without causing any civilian casualties
although both iras operated openly neither was in control of free derry the barricades were manned by unarmed'auxiliaries'. crime was dealt with by a volunteer force called the free derry police which was headed by tony o 'doherty a derry footballer and northern ireland international
an anti-internment protest organised by the northern ireland civil rights association nicra at magilligan camp in january 1972 was met with violence from the 1st battalion the parachute regiment 1 para nicra had organised a march from the creggan to derry city centre in defiance of a ban on the following sunday 30 january 1972 both iras were asked and agreed to suspend operations on that day to ensure the march passed off peacefully the british army erected barricades around the free derry area to prevent marchers from reaching the city centre on the day march organisers turned the march away from the barriers and up to free derry corner but some youths proceeded to the barrier at william street and stoned soldiers troops from 1 para then moved into free derry and opened fire killing thirteen people all of whom were subsequently found to be unarmed a fourteenth shooting victim died four months later in june 1972 like the killing of cusack and beattie the previous year bloody sunday had the effect of hugely increasing recruitment to the ira even among people who previously would have been'moderates'.
both the provisional and official ira stepped up attacks after bloody sunday with the tacit support of the residents local feelings changed however with the killing of ranger william best by the official ira best was a 19-year-old local man who was home on leave from the british army at his parents'house in the creggan he was abducted interrogated and shot the following day 500 women marched to the republican club offices in protest nine days later on 29 may the official ira declared a ceasefire the provisional ira initially stated that they would not follow suit but after informal approaches to the british government they announced a ceasefire from 26 june martin mcguinness was the derry representative in a party of senior provisionals who travelled to london for talks with william whitelaw the secretary of state for northern ireland the talks were not resumed after the ending of the truce following a violent confrontation in belfast when troops prevented catholic families from taking over houses in the lenadoon estate
political pressure for the action against the no-go areas increased after the events of bloody friday in belfast a british army attack was considered inevitable and the ira took the decision not to resist it on 31 july 1972 operation motorman was launched when thousands of british troops equipped with armoured cars and armoured bulldozers avres dismantled the barricades and occupied the area
after operation motorman the british army controlled the bogside and creggan by stationing large numbers of troops within the area by conducting large-scale'search'operations that were in fact undertaken for purposes of intelligence gathering and by setting up over a dozen covert observation posts over the following years ira violence in the city was contained to the point where it was possible to believe'the war was over'in the area although there were still frequent street riots nationalists — even those who did not support the ira — remained bitterly opposed to the army and to the state
many of the residents'original grievances were addressed with the passing of the local government northern ireland act 1972 which redrew the electoral boundaries and introduced universal adult suffrage based on the single transferable vote elections were held in may 1973 nationalists gained a majority on the council for the first time since 1923 since then the area has been extensively redeveloped with modern housing replacing the old houses and flats the free derry era is commemorated by the free derry wall the murals of the bogside artists and the museum of free derry

view of the world from 9th avenue sometimes a parochial new yorker's view of the world a new yorker's view of the world or simply view of the world is a 1976 illustration by saul steinberg that served as the cover of the march 29 1976 edition of the new yorker the work presents the view from manhattan of the rest of the world showing manhattan as the center of the world
view of the world has been parodied by ted rall columbia pictures the new yorker the economist and mad magazine among others the work has been imitated and printed without authorization in a variety of ways the columbia parody led to a ruling by the united states district court for the southern district of new york in steinberg v. columbia pictures industries inc. in favor of steinberg because of copyright violations by columbia pictures the work is regarded as one of the greatest magazine covers of recent generations and is studied by art students around the world
saul steinberg created 85 covers and 642 internal drawings and illustrations for the new yorker including its march 29 1976 cover titled view of the world from 9th avenue this is regarded as his most famous work it is considered an example of unintentional fame steinberg has noted that the type of fame that resulted from the work has diminished his significance to the man who did that poster the work is sometimes referred to as a parochial new yorker's view of the world or a new yorker's view of the world because it depicts a map of the world as seen by self-absorbed new yorkers at one point the new yorker applied for a copyright from the united states copyright office for the work it assigned the copyright to steinberg and subsequently reproduced posters of the painting
the illustration is split in two parts with the bottom half of the image showing manhattan's 9th avenue 10th avenue and the hudson river appropriately labeled and the top half depicting the rest of the world it is a westward view over 10th avenue the rest of the united states is the size of the three new york city blocks and is drawn as a rectangle bounded by north american neighbors canada and mexico with a thin brown strip along the hudson representing jersey the names of five cities los angeles washington d.c. las vegas kansas city and chicago and three states texas utah and nebraska scattered among a few rocks for the united states beyond new jersey which is in bolder font than the rest of the country beyond the hudson washington d.c. is depicted as a remote location near mexico the pacific ocean slightly wider than the hudson separates the united states from three flattened land masses labeled china japan and russia notably the image depicts the world with a back turned to europe which is absent from the painting
the work is composed in ink pencil colored pencil and watercolor on paper and measures 28 by 19 inches 71 cm × 48 cm when exhibiting this work along with alternate versions and sketches the university of pennsylvania summarized the work as a bird's-eye view of the city from ninth avenue in a straight line westward with space becoming ever more condensed ... they also described the work as a tongue-in-cheek view of the world new york interpreted the new york-centric mind's view of the rest of the world as a set of outer boroughs as iconic national post journalist robert fulford described the perspective as one in which the entire world is a suburb of manhattan
view of the world has been imitated without authorization in a variety of ways the work has been imitated in postcard format by numerous municipalities states and nations steinberg had stated that he could have retired on royalties from the many parodies made of the painting had they been paid a motivation for his eventual copyright lawsuit for the moscow on the hudson use fulford writing in the national post noted that the metaphor of the world as a suburb of manhattan was understood and borrowed by the whole world local artists especially poster artists presented similarly compelling depictions of their own provincial perceptions fulford demonstrated the prominence of this work by mentioning that a high school in suburban ottawa made imitating view of the world an assignment in its graphic arts class he also noted that the results of this assignment was a worldwide variety of global foci from which the students viewed the world
the illustration — humorously depicting new yorkers'self-image of their place in the world or perhaps outsiders'view of new yorkers'self-image — inspired many similar works including the poster for the 1984 film moscow on the hudson that movie poster led to a lawsuit steinberg v. columbia pictures industries inc 663 f. supp 706 s.d.n.y. 1987 which held that columbia pictures violated the copyright steinberg held on his work
on june 5 2003 during the first term of george w. bush's presidency ted rall presented a view of the world from pennsylvania avenue as a parody of view of the world from 9th avenue in a universal press syndicate editorial cartoon he replaced the letters representing the new yorker with the bushie
the cover was later satirized by barry blitt for the cover of the new yorker on october 6 2008 the cover featured sarah palin looking out of her window seeing only alaska with russia in the far background
the march 21 2009 the economist included a story entitled how china sees the world that presents a parody that is also an homage to the original image but depicting the viewpoint from beijing's chang 'an avenue instead of manhattan a caption above the illustration reads illustration by jon berkeley with apologies to steinberg and the new yorker it accompanied an article that discussed the burgeoning chinese economy at the time of the contemporary financial crisis
the october 1 2012 cover of mad magazine satirized the problems with the september release of apple inc .'s ios 6 mobile operating system which included apple maps a replacement for google maps the work presents what view of the world might look like if one had relied upon the september 2012 version of apple maps to locate various landmarks
on october 17 2005 american society of magazine editors unveiled its list of the top 40 magazine covers of the prior 40 years and ranked view of the world from 9th avenue in fourth place the listing stated that the work ... has come to represent manhattan's telescoped perception of the country beyond the hudson river the cartoon showed the supposed limited mental geography of manhattanites
bintulu biːnˈtuːluː chinese 都 pinyin míndūlǔ pe ̍ h-ōe-jī bîn-to  -ló  is a coastal town on the island of borneo in the central region of sarawak malaysia bintulu is located 610 kilometres 380 mi northeast of kuching 216 kilometres 134 mi northeast of sibu and 200 kilometres 120 mi southwest of miri with a population of 114,058 as of 2010 bintulu is the capital of the bintulu district of the bintulu division of sarawak malaysia
the name of bintulu was derived from the local native language mentu ulau picking heads bintulu was a small fishing village when rajah james brooke acquired it in 1861 brooke later built a fort there in 1862 in 1867 the first general council meeting now sarawak state legislative assembly was convened in bintulu it is the earliest state legislature system in malaysia the construction of the earliest airstrip in bintulu began in 1934 but was halted in 1938 due to financial difficulties during world war ii the airstrip was heavily bombed by allied forces the british later rebuilt the airstrip and it became fully operational in 1955 the old airport was replaced by a new airport in 2002 bintulu remained a fishing village until 1969 when oil and gas reserves were discovered off the coast since then bintulu has become the centre of energy intensive industries such as a malaysia lng plant a shell middle distillate synthesis plant and a bintulu combined cycle power plant the economy has also expanded into oil palm and forest plantations palm oil processing wood-waste processing and cement manufacturing the port of bintulu is the busiest in sarawak the town is also a gateway to samalajau industrial park
among the tourist attractions in bintulu are similajau national park tumbina park tanjung batu beach jepak village kuan yin tong temple assyakirin mosque council negri monument tamu bintulu and pasar utama markets the borneo international kite festival is held annually in the town
during the 16th century bintulu was named river de burulu by portuguese cartographers there are several legends surrounding the name bintulu during the brooke dynasty the indigenous iban people practised headhunting to maintain their social status in the community they threw the heads into the kemena river after which the heads had to be collected from the river the practice of collecting the heads was known as mentu ulau picking heads in the local native language another story relates that two iban warriors named bernik and jelab built houses along the river they and their followers frequently carried out preservation of severed heads near a small river stream branching off from sebezaw river because the river bank was flat and wide therefore the small river stream was named mentu ulau river outsiders who came to bintulu subsequently pronounced the name as mentulau and later the name evolved into bentulu and finally bintulu

temple beth israel hebrew בית ישראל is a reconstructionist synagogue located at 1175 east 29th avenue in eugene oregon founded in the early 1930s as a conservative congregation beth israel was for many decades the only synagogue in eugene
the congregation initially worshipped in a converted house on west eighth street it constructed its first building on portland street in 1952 and occupied its current leed-compliant facilities in 2008
in the early 1990s conflict between feminist and traditional members led to the latter leaving beth israel and forming the orthodox congregation ahavas torah beth israel came under attack from neo-nazi members of the volksfront twice in 1994 and again in 2002 in both cases the perpetrators were caught and convicted
services were lay-led for decades marcus simmons was hired as the congregation's first rabbi in 1959 but left in 1961 after a gap of two years louis neimand became rabbi in 1963 and served until his death in 1976 he was followed by myron kinberg who served from 1977 to 1994 and kinberg in turn was succeeded by yitzhak husbands-hankin maurice harris joined husbands-hankin as associate rabbi in 2003 and served until 2011 when he was succeeded by boris dolin as of 2014 led by husbands-hankin and dolin beth israel had approximately 400 member households and was the largest synagogue in eugene
small numbers of german jews began settling in eugene in the late 19th century but most moved on in the early 20th century the first eastern european jews settled there and by the 1920s eugene's jewish community began gathering prayer quorums for holding friday night and jewish holiday services in individuals'homes historian steven lowenstein writes that a fter hymen rubenstein's death in 1933 his home at 231 west eighth street was remodeled and named temple beth israel it was a traditional conservative synagogue and from that time until the 1990s it was the only synagogue in eugene
in 1952 the congregation constructed a one-story synagogue building on an almost 1 acre 0.40 ha property at 2550 portland street designed by architect and holocaust-survivor heinrich hormuth h.h. waechter the building featured an interior courtyard that provided natural lighting and a network of ceiling beams painted with symbols and shapes by waechter
temple beth israel's services and religious functions were lay-led for decades its first rabbi was marcus simmons originally from england he was a graduate of university of london and oxford university and was ordained at the hebrew theological seminary he emigrated to the united states in 1957 and joined beth israel in 1959 the members were not however agreed that a full-time rabbi was required and in 1961 he accepted a rabbinical position in downey california
following a hiatus of two years louis neimand was hired as rabbi in 1963 born in new york city in 1912 to immigrant parents he was a graduate of city university of new york and was ordained at the jewish institute of new york he had previously worked for the united jewish appeal and from 1959 to 1963 was the first hillel rabbi at syracuse university there was some concern about neimand's hiring as he had a police record as a result of his involvement in freedom marches in the african-american civil rights movement 1955–1968 he served until his death in 1976
myron kinberg was hired as rabbi in 1977 ordained in reform judaism he had previously served as a rabbi in topeka kansas for two years then lived in israel for two years before coming to eugene kinberg was known for his support for minority rights and gay rights anti-nuclear and anti-war activism support of reconciliation between israel and the palestinians and outreach to non-observant members of eugene's jewish community
kinberg attempted to revive the biblical concept of the ger toshav in his approach to intermarriage he was willing to officiate at an intermarriage if the non-jewish partner after discussions with the rabbi agreed of his or her own free will to fulfill a set of commitments including a commitment to a jewish home life participation in jewish life and tradition and raising future children as jews the non-jewish partner making this commitment became a ger toshav or non-jewish member of the jewish people
kinberg's wife alice was a strong feminist and during the 1980s he and his wife supported a number of changes to the liturgy and ritual these included allowing women to read from the torah and lead the prayers and changing prayers to be more gender inclusive for example using gender-neutral terms and pronouns for god and adding references to the biblical matriarchs in prayers like the amidah which traditionally only mentioned the biblical patriarchs while most congregation members approved of these changes a minority resisted them
by the early 1990s serious divisions developed among the members of the congregation over a number of issues including personal antagonisms the rabbi's activism and advocacy of'ultra-liberal'causes political differences over the israeli–palestinian conflict and
a myriad of additional jewish cultural religious issues such as the acceptance of intermarried couples adherence to kosher dietary laws the use of modern language and music during worship services rewriting of certain prayers such as the aleynu to make them less ethnocentric and so on
however the biggest source of division which underlay all others was the roles and rights of men and women in the synagogue
in the early 1990s a group of newly observant members began holding more traditional services in a back room of the synagogue complete with a mechitza a partition separating men and women the more feminist-minded members strongly objected to having a mechitza anywhere in the temple beth israel building even if it were not in the services they attended the latter group eventually circulated a petition which stated that either the mechitza would have to be taken down or those members who wanted it would have to leave kinberg also signed the petition faced with this opposition in 1992 the orthodox members left renting new premises and hiring their own rabbi creating eugene's second synagogue originally called the halachic minyan and in 1998 renamed congregation ahavas torah
kinberg held himself responsible and the schism led to his reassessment of the needs of temple beth israel and his role as a rabbi as a result he left beth israel in 1994 to lead a synagogue on long island during his tenure at beth israel membership rose from 118 to 350 families kinberg died two years later at age 51
yitzhak husbands-hankin succeeded kinberg in 1995 husbands-hankin began his involvement at temple beth israel first as a congregant then as cantor and then as an assistant rabbi he was active in forming the jewish renewal movement and was ordained by its leader zalman schachter-shalomi
the congregation decided to leave the conservative movement in 1995 and for a year had no affiliation in late 1996 after considering both reform and reconstructionist as alternatives the congregation affiliated with the reconstructionist movement by 1999 membership had grown to around 370 families
husbands-hankin was instrumental in developing the concept of ethical kashrut the idea that one should only purchase goods that are produced in an ethical way his essay ethical kashrut was selected for publication in arthur kurzweil's best jewish writing 2003 a singer cello and guitar player he composes and performs jewish music
husbands-hankin has had four assistant or associate rabbis working with him shoshana spergel joined temple beth israel in 1998 as interim rabbi when husbands-hankins went on a sabbatical jonathan seidel was assistant rabbi from 2001 to 2003 maurice harris a 2003 graduate of the reconstructionist rabbinical college joined as assistant rabbi in 2003 he is one of the signators of the open letter concerning religion and science from american rabbis part of the clergy letter project which encourages and embraces the teaching of evolution in schools in 2011 boris dolin joined the congregation as its newest associate rabbi
on march 20 1994 chris lord an individual associated with the volksfront and american front fired ten rounds with an assault rifle into the temple damaging the interior the attacks were prompted by a newspaper article about several members of eugene's jewish community including a lesbian community organizations including a local gay rights group responded by standing vigil outside the synagogue during passover services lord and an associate were caught and convicted and lord was sentenced to four and a half years in prison
on october 25 2002 jacob laskey his brother gabriel laskey gerald poundstone jesse baker and one other man all members of the volksfront drove to beth israel with the intent of intimidating the congregants while a service with 80 members attending was taking place the men threw rocks etched with nazi swastikas through the synagogue's stained glass windows then sped off the men were caught pleaded guilty and were convicted they served sentences ranging from a 6-month work release term and five years probation to eleven years and three months in federal prison for the ringleader jacob laskey
originally sized for 75 families temple beth israel's portland street building had been renovated and enlarged over the years to 7,500 square feet 700 m2 to accommodate 250 families and 150 students despite these additions and the loss of members to congregation ahavas torah the synagogue was not large enough particularly during the high holidays when extra space had to be rented in 1997 the congregation purchased the property of the university street christian church for 500,000 today 740,000 and began planning for a new facility the members considered renovating the existing building on the property but felt a new building would better suit their requirements and razed the church
in 2003 the congregation got a permit to begin construction of a new facility on the now-vacant 1.37-acre 0.55 ha plot of land at the northwest corner of east 29th avenue and university street an initial capital campaign raised more than 1.8 million which fully paid for the land and by august 2007 an additional 1.7 million had been raised towards anticipated overall project costs of 5 million
the environmentally sensitive building was designed by mel solomon and associates of kansas city and local company tbg architects planners and built by mckenzie commercial construction of eugene the building used energy efficient heating ventilation and lighting specific design issues with the building's energy efficiency included the fact that the largest room in the building the sanctuary was also the least-used and in accord with jewish tradition had to face east towards jerusalem
on june 8 2008 the congregation dedicated its new building at 1175 east 29th avenue at approximately 25,000 square feet 2,300 m2 the facility included a sanctuary commercial kitchen banquet facilities and classrooms and housed the synagogue the lane county jewish federation and the local jewish family service the project ended up costing 6 million of which 4 million had been raised
made of concrete steel and wood the building achieved leadership in energy and environmental design compliance through the integration of stormwater management strategies high efficiency irrigation the use of recycled and or recyclable materials and drought tolerant plantings completely recyclable materials used in the structure included carpeting and wood beams
in 2008 temple beth israel participated in banners across america an interfaith witness against torture coordinated by the national religious campaign against torture as part of the jewish campaign against torture organized by rabbis for human rights — north america in honor of torture awareness month the jewish campaign included over 25 synagogues which hung banners protesting the use of abusive interrogation techniques by the american military and intelligence community that year congregational membership reached almost 400 families and the talmud torah and pre-school had about 200 and 40 students respectively
the congregation sold the old synagogue building on portland street to security first portland street child development center for 815,000 in 2009 carrying the center's financing the building was converted for use as an educational center while retaining some of the original architectural elements difficult economic conditions forced the child development center to give up the building in 2011 and eugene's network charter school planned to move into it in autumn 2011
harris announced he would be stepping down as rabbi in 2011 and the synagogue hired boris dolin as his successor born and raised in oregon dolin had worked at temple beth israel as a teacher and youth group adviser from 1999 to 2001 a graduate of the university of oregon with a master's degree in jewish education from the jewish theological seminary he was ordained by the reconstructionist rabbinical college

the route was assigned as part of the 1930 renumbering of state highways in new york although it began in youngstown and ended in newstead as it does today the initial routing of ny 93 deviated from the modern path in the vicinity of the city of lockport from cambria to lockport's eastern suburbs the highway originally used ny 425 lower mountain road akron road and a series of streets in lockport ny 93 was moved onto ny 104 and junction road in cambria in the 1940s and altered to bypass lockport to the south on a new highway and robinson and dysinger roads in 1991 in 2006 ny 93 was realigned west of lockport to continue south on junction road to ny 31 the change removed ny 93 from upper mountain road a county-owned highway that had been part of the route since the 1930s
ny 93 begins at an intersection with ny 18f main street co-designated but not signed as county route 907 or cr 907 in the center of the village of youngstown the route proceeds eastward through the village as a two-lane road named lockport street serving two blocks of commercial areas before bending to the northeast and passing into the residential eastern portion of youngstown at the eastern village limits ny 93 briefly widens to four lanes as it enters a partial cloverleaf interchange with the niagara scenic parkway past the junction the highway reverts to a two-lane road and changes names to youngstown–lockport road as it runs across the town of porter the residential surroundings continue to the hamlet of towers corners where ny 93 connects to ny 18 creek road
after ny 18 ny 93 curves to the southeast serving another residential stretch ahead of a junction with youngstown–wilson road cr 36 on the eastern edge of towers corners after this intersection the homes give way to farms as the road heads into rural areas of the town the route continues on a southeast track through porter passing a mixture of rural and residential areas on its way into the hamlet of porter center where ny 93 enters an intersection with porter center road cr 57 another southeastward stretch brings the route across twelvemile creek and into the hamlet of ransomville where ny 93 becomes the community's main street through ransomville ny 93 retains the youngstown–lockport road name intersecting with ransomville road cr 17 in the hamlet's business district
just outside ransomville ny 93 leaves the town of porter for the town of wilson it continues generally southeastward across mostly open terrain meeting randall road cr 83 and church street cr 56 on its way to the town of cambria ny 93 becomes north ridge road at the town line and it soon enters the hamlet of north ridge a community built up around the route's intersection with ny 425 cambria–wilson road the hamlet's residential surroundings continue to the adjacent community of molyneaux corners where ny 93 becomes concurrent with ny 104 ridge road ny 93 and ny 104 proceed northeast across lightly populated areas for 2 miles 3.2 km to the hamlet of warren corners at which point ny 93 splits from ny 104 and heads southward along town line road it immediately intersects with stone road cr 19 before leaving the hamlet
outside of warren corners the route heads across rural areas along the cambria–lockport town line it soon enters the small hamlet of hickory corners where the road passes under lower mountain road cr 902 access to the highway is made by way of town line road spur cr 114 a connector leading to lower mountain road ny 93 continues southward along the town line changing names to junction road at an intersection with upper mountain road cr 5 west of the city of lockport from here the route crosses over csx transportation's lockport subdivision rail line at the hamlet of lockport junction before intersecting with ny 31 saunders settlement road and ny 270 campbell boulevard just south of the community ny 270 begins straight ahead to the south while ny 93 turns northeast onto saunders settlement road beginning a concurrency with ny 31
now fully in the town of lockport ny 31 and ny 93 proceed northeast through an open area of the town as a four-lane divided highway the two routes continue to the western edge of the city of lockport where they intersect with upper mountain road and the lockport bypass the overlap ends here as ny 93 turns southeastward onto the two-lane bypass along the bypass ny 93 briefly enters the city limits as it runs past several industrial facilities and intersects with hinman road cr 903 just ahead of a bridge over the erie canal past the waterway the bypass takes a more southerly course through an undeveloped part of the town of lockport to a junction with robinson road cr 123 on the lockport–pendleton town line the lockport bypass ends here leaving ny 93 to turn eastward onto robinson road
the route initially serves a line of homes as it heads along robinson road however it soon enters a commercial district surrounding the road's intersection with ny 78 transit road at this point the lockport–pendleton town line turns south to follow ny 78 leaving ny 93 fully within the town of lockport as it runs eastward past another stretch of homes not far from ny 78 ny 93 changes names to dysinger road at an intersection with beattie avenue cr 14 and raymond road cr 85 the junction also marks a shift in the road's surroundings as the homes give way to open rolling terrain ny 93 continues eastward for several miles to the town of royalton where it meets riddle road cr 35 and akron road cr 142 at adjacent intersections just east of the town line
ny 93 takes over akron road's name and right-of-way continuing eastward past a line of scattered homes to reach the sparsely developed hamlet of dysinger here the route turns southward at a junction with bunker hill road cr 136 outside of dysinger ny 93 heads southeastward across undeveloped areas of royalton connecting to block church road cr 110 as it approaches tonawanda creek and the niagara–erie county line the road runs along the northern edge of the creek for about 1.5 miles 2.4 km prior to curving southward at an intersection with wolcottsville road cr 122 the turn brings ny 93 across tonawanda creek and into the erie county town of newstead where it becomes known as maple road and immediately intersects with cr 260 koepsel road
continuing southward ny 93 runs across open rolling terrain meeting cr 259 tonawanda creek road on its way to the hamlet of swifts mills here the rural surroundings briefly give way to residential areas as ny 93 intersects with cr 255 swift mills road in the center of the community south of swifts mills the road serves only intermittent stretches of homes for 2 miles 3.2 km including a cluster of residences around its closely spaced intersections with cr 253 carney road and cr 42 rapids road it continues on a southward track past the eastern terminus of cr 218 hunts corner–akron road to the outskirts of the village of akron where the highway turns east onto lewis road and soon enters the village limits ny 93 runs past a line of homes before intersecting cedar street a road maintained by erie county as cr 261 north of the village
the route turns south at cedar street following the residential street into downtown akron here ny 93 intersects with cr 573 john street at a junction that was once the western terminus of ny 267 at this intersection ny 93 heads west on john street for one block before continuing south on buffalo street for another block to main street ny 93 turns westward again following main street through the westernmost part of akron's central business district prior to curving southwestward at a junction with mechanic street the highway takes on the mechanic street name as it crosses over murder creek and leaves downtown akron just south of the creek ny 93 changes names to buell street at an intersection with jackson street
as the route continues southward through the southern part of akron it serves mostly residential areas save for an industrial complex at ny 93's intersection with cr 163 clarence center road and cr 167 parkview drive ny 93 exits akron a short distance south of the junction at which point the route heads into another area of open fields while retaining the buell street name it continues on a southward track for about 1 mile 1.6 km to a commercialized intersection with ny 5 main road where buell street and ny 93 both come to an end
ny 93 was established as part of the 1930 renumbering of state highways in new york connecting the cities and villages of youngstown lockport and akron while the termini of ny 93 have remained the same to this day several portions of the route have been realigned since that time when ny 93 was first assigned it turned south at the hamlet of north ridge and overlapped with ny 425 along cambria–wilson road to lower mountain road then part of ny 3 ny 425 went west from this junction while ny 93 headed eastward following ny 3 along lower mountain gothic hill upper mountain and saunders settlement roads to the city of lockport at locust street ny 93 left ny 3 and exited the city along locust high and akron streets and akron road it met its current alignment southeast of the city in royalton
ny 3 was realigned c 1932 to follow saunders settlement road between shawnee road ny 425 and upper mountain road the former routing of ny 3 along shawnee lower mountain gothic hill and upper mountain roads was redesignated as ny 3a even though all of ny 3's former routing was already part of either ny 425 or ny 93 the ny 3a designation was eliminated c 1935 when ny 3 was truncated eastward to a new western terminus in central new york in the early 1940s ny 93 was altered to follow north ridge road u.s. route 104 now ny 104 and junction road between north ridge and lower mountain road
around the same time that ny 93 was rerouted ny 270 was also extended northward along junction road from ny 31 to us 104 as a result ny 93 overlapped ny 270 between lower mountain road and us 104 the overlap with ny 270 remained in place until c 1963 when ny 270 was truncated southward to the intersection of lower mountain and junction roads ny 93 was realigned in the late 1970s to bypass lower mountain and gothic hill roads on junction and upper mountain roads replacing ny 270 along junction road the lower mountain road portion of ny 93's former routing is now maintained by niagara county as county route 902 cr 902
the lockport bypass a highway bypassing downtown lockport to the southwest was opened to traffic on july 26 1991 the highway cost 7.7 million equivalent to 13.4 million in 2016 to construct and extended from the junction of ny 31 and ny 93 west of the city to robinson road south of downtown ny 93 was realigned to follow the new bypass south to robinson road where it turned east and followed robinson road cr 123 and dysinger road cr 133 to akron road in royalton the portion of akron road ny 93's former routing east of the lockport city limits became ny 954m an unsigned reference route
ownership and maintenance of robinson road from the bypass to ny 78 was transferred from niagara county to the state of new york on september 1 1990 as part of a highway maintenance swap between the two levels of government the portion of ny 93 between ny 78 and akron road became state-maintained on october 1 1998 as part of another swap that also transferred ownership and maintenance of akron road to niagara county akron road is now cr 142
on november 1 2005 the niagara county legislature voted on a measure to allow the county to ask the new york state department of transportation nysdot to remove the ny 93 designation from upper mountain road a county-maintained highway and reassign it to junction road ny 270 and saunders settlement road ny 31 the impetus for the change came from a resident of upper mountain road who demanded that trucks should be removed from the roadway this part of the agenda was passed nysdot obliged to the request in 2006 rerouting ny 93 as proposed and truncating ny 270 southward to ny 31

typhoon krosa known in the philippines as typhoon vinta was a typhoon that made landfall in the northern philippines in late october 2013 forming on october 27 near guam the storm slowly intensified while moving westward krosa developed an eye and became a typhoon before striking luzon on october 31 the storm weakened over land but re-intensified over the south china sea reaching peak winds of 150 km h 90 mph on november 2 off the southeast coast of china typhoon krosa stalled and encountered unfavorable conditions resulting in quick weakening by november 3 it had weakened to tropical storm status and was no longer being warned on by the next day in northern luzon krosa damaged 32,000 houses including 3,000 that were destroyed and caused four fatalities high winds and rainfall left p277 million php 6.4 million usd in damage
on october 27 an area of convection with a broad circulation persisted southeast of guam and slowly consolidated due to moderate wind shear and westerly outflow that day the japan meteorological agency jma classified the system as a tropical depression about 380 km 235 mi to the southeast of hagåtña guam at 2100 utc on october 28 the philippine atmospheric geophysical and astronomical services administration pagasa began issuing advisories on the depression giving it the local name vinta the next day the jma upgraded the depression to tropical storm krosa 1329 and the joint typhoon warning center jtwc also classified it as tropical depression 29w by that time the storm was moving steadily westward due to the subtropical ridge to the north with the warm waters of the philippine sea lessening wind shear and improving outflow krosa gradually strengthened and the jtwc also upgraded krosa to tropical storm status on october 30 after an eye feature developed
while approaching northern luzon on october 29 krosa quickly intensified as the initial eye feature organized into a well-defined eye late on october 30 the jtwc upgraded krosa to typhoon status and the next day both pagasa and jma followed suit on october 31 krosa made landfall in northeastern luzon near cagayan and developed a symmetric eyewall while initially moving over land land interaction weakened the eye by the time krosa emerged into the south china sea late on october 31 the next day pagasa discontinued advisories after the typhoon exited the region convection rebuilt around the center with continued favorable conditions allowing for restrengthening
late on november 1 a large eye redeveloped and the jtwc estimated krosa attained peak 1 minute sustained winds of 185 km h 115 mph early the next day the jma also estimated the typhoon reached peak 10 minute winds of 140 km h 85 mph later increasing wind shear caused the eye to deteriorate and krosa began slowing about 260 km 160 mi east-southeast of hong kong after reaching the western edge of the subtropical ridge after remaining nearly stationary krosa began moving steadily to the west-southwest due to a new ridge the convection continued to weaken due to continued shear and cooler waters from upwelling and krosa deteriorated to tropical storm status on november 3 the next day the jtwc issued its final advisory after the circulation became exposed from the convection also on november 4 the jma downgraded krosa to tropical depression status off the northeast vietnam coast the system dissipated at 0000 utc on november 5
before krosa struck the philippines pagasa issued a number 3 warning signal for portions of northern luzon where winds were expected to reach over 100 km h 60 mph the agency noted for the potential for flooding and landslides high winds knocked down trees across luzon and left about 80 of cagayan province without power as well as some areas without internet or cellphone service portions of the pan-philippine highway were blocked and in lal-lo cagayan a car crashed into a gasoline truck due to power outages agriculture damage was estimated at p273 million php 6.3 million usd occurring just before the start of the harvest across the island the typhoon damaged 32,745 houses including 3,837 that were destroyed forcing 65,648 people to evacuate to storm shelters overall krosa killed four people in the philippines and left p273 million php 6.4 million usd in damage after the storm workers quickly restored power lines while the government provided monetary assistance to storm-ravaged families after cagayan was declared a state of calamity members of the philippine military and department of public works and highways worked to clean up following the storm
the china national meteorological centre issued a yellow alert the second-lowest of the four level warning system for hainan due to the threat of the storm the agency recommended boats to return to port agencies in vietnam also warned for the potential of heavy rainfall due to the dissipating tropical depression krosa and released water from three dams to prevent overflow
kirby's block ball is a 1995 action video game a spin-off from the kirby series for the game boy portable console it is a breakout clone the player controls paddles along the screen's edge to knock a bouncing ball kirby into destructible bricks the game's 55 levels include power-ups bonus rounds and minigames kirby's block ball was developed by hal laboratory and nintendo r d1 the team spent half a year revising the gameplay to match kirby's signature characteristics kirby's block ball was published by nintendo first in japan in 1995 later in europe and last in north america in 1996
reviewers considered the game an improvement on the breakout formula and praised its gameplay craftsmanship and incorporation of the kirby series it was included in multiple top game boy game lists and was later emulated on the nintendo 3ds virtual console
the player controls paddles along the screen's edges to knock a bouncing ball kirby into destructible bricks the player loses a life if kirby hits the edge of the screen each of the game's eleven stages include five rounds of increasingly complex block patterns for kirby to clear the ten different block types vary in durability and points value a well-timed hit of the paddle gives kirby a powerful bounce to break through harder blocks another block type turns the remaining blocks into a bonus round that rewards the player for clearing the screen in the least amount of time the player can find warp stars that lead to minigames such as air hockey where the player can earn extra lives the rounds also include enemies to attack and avoid some enemies contain bonus items each stage ends in a boss fight
with stone needle flame and spark power-ups kirby can transform to interact with blocks differently for instance the spark power-up lets kirby break through otherwise indestructible blocks and the needle lets kirby hit spikes once without losing a life the game has a themed frame and uses a wide palette of colors in-game when played with the super game boy
the game was developed by hal laboratory with gunpei yokoi's nintendo r d1 and published by nintendo at one point in development hal decided that the game did not feel like a kirby game the team spent six months completely revising the game under explicit instructions on how kirby should move kirby games contain elements of unrestricted creative movement as a general theme kirby's block ball was released for the game boy first in japan in 1995 and later in europe 1995 and north america may 1996 it was later emulated on the nintendo 3ds virtual console and released first in japan october 2011 and later in europe february 2012 and north america may 2012
on release the four reviewers of electronic gaming monthly applauded kirby's block ball for modifying the breakout formula to create a new and enjoyable game they especially praised the unique power-ups though crispin boyer and sushi x also felt the game was too short and easy nintendo power said they enjoyed block ball and its number of stages but wondered how its eight megabits of memory were being used the magazine found the parts where kirby eats the unbreakable blocks to be innovative all six of the magazine's reviewers recommended the game
ign wrote that the game was primarily remembered as an arkanoid or breakout clone skinned with the kirby franchise ign calculated an average reviewer score of 7.4 10 the kirby series became known for its number of non-platformer spin-offs of which block ball was one like kirby's pinball land and kirby's dream course kirby's spherical shape lent itself towards ball-like roles ign wrote that block ball was the first truly out there kirby spin-off but that the game was too short
planet game boy called it one of the original game boy's ten all-time classics and gamesradar placed it among the top 25 game boy games released they considered kirby's block ball an improvement upon alleyway a game boy launch title and breakout clone ign recommended the game upon its 3ds rerelease both in general and for breakout fans nintendo world report recommended the game to players who like score attack games and called it the best version of breakout released retrospective reviewers found the game enjoyable and praised the craft behind the gameplay and kirby themes alternatively kirby's block ball received the lowest rating on tim rogers's 2004 yamanote scoring system for portable games a metric by which he played a game while counting stops on the circular yamanote train line until he lost interest with a score of one stop he called it too damned bland
in a retrospective review jeuxvideo.com had high praise for the level design graphics and animations they also found the music excellent in comparison to the annoying and repetitive soundtrack of most breakout clones the magazine also liked how the game fit the kirby universe apart from its increased difficulty — jeuxvideo.com occasionally had trouble hitting the slow-paced ball with precision

the commonwealth war graves commission cwgc is an intergovernmental organisation of six independent member states whose principal function is to mark record and maintain the graves and places of commemoration of commonwealth of nations military service members who died in the two world wars the commission is also responsible for commemorating commonwealth civilians who died as a result of enemy action during world war ii the commission was founded by fabian ware and constituted through royal charter in 1917 named the imperial war graves commission the change to the present name took place in 1960
the commission as part of its mandate is responsible for commemorating all commonwealth war dead individually and equally to this end the war dead are commemorated by name on a headstone at an identified site of a burial or on a memorial war dead are commemorated uniformly and equally irrespective of military or civil rank race or creed
the commission is currently responsible for the continued commemoration of 1.7 million deceased commonwealth military service members in 153 countries since its inception the commission has constructed approximately 2,500 war cemeteries and numerous memorials the commission is currently responsible for the care of war dead at over 23,000 separate burial sites and the maintenance of more than 200 memorials worldwide in addition to commemorating commonwealth military service members the commission maintains under arrangement with applicable governments over 40,000 non-commonwealth war graves and over 25,000 non-war military and civilian graves the commission operates through the continued financial support of the member states united kingdom canada australia new zealand india and south africa the current president of the commonwealth war graves commission is prince edward duke of kent
on the outbreak of world war i in 1914 fabian ware a director of the rio tinto company found that at 45 years old he was too old to join the british army he used the influence of rio tinto chairman viscount milner to become the commander of a mobile unit of the british red cross he arrived in france in september 1914 and whilst there was struck by the lack of any official mechanism for documenting or marking the location of graves of those who had been killed and felt compelled to create an organisation within the red cross for this purpose in march 1915 with the support of nevil macready adjutant-general of the british expeditionary force ware's work was given official recognition and support by the imperial war office and the unit was transferred to the british army as the graves registration commission the new graves registration commission had over 31,000 graves of british and imperial soldiers registered by october 1915 and 50,000 registered by may 1916
when municipal graveyards began to overfill ware began negotiations with various local authorities to acquire land for further cemeteries ware began with an agreement with france to build joint british and french cemeteries under the understanding that these would be maintained by the french government ware eventually concluded that it was not prudent to leave the maintenance responsibilities solely to the french government and subsequently arranged for france to purchase the land grant it in perpetuity and leave the management and maintenance responsibilities to the british the french government agreed under the condition that cemeteries respected certain dimensions were accessible by public road were in the vicinity of medical aid stations and were not too close to towns or villages similar negotiations were started with the belgian government
as reports of the grave registration work became public the commission began to receive letters of enquiry and requests for photographs of graves from relatives of deceased soldiers by 1917 17,000 photographs had been dispatched to relatives in march 1915 the commission with the support of the red cross began to dispatch photographic prints and cemetery location information in answer to the requests the graves registration commission became the directorate of graves registration and enquiries in the spring of 1916 in recognition of the fact that the scope of work began to extend beyond simple grave registration and began to include responding to enquiries from relatives of those killed the directorate's work was also extended beyond the western front and into other theatres of war with units deployed in greece egypt and mesopotamia
as the war continued ware and others became concerned about the fate of the graves in the post-war period following a suggestion by the british army the national committee for the care of soldiers'graves was appointed by the british government in january 1916 with edward prince of wales agreeing to serve as president the national committee for the care of soldiers'graves was created with the intention of taking over the work of the directorate of graves registration and enquiries after the war the government felt that it was more appropriate to entrust the work to a specially appointed body rather than to any existing government department by early 1917 a number of members of the committee believed a formal imperial organisation would be needed to care for the graves with the help of edward prince of wales ware submitted a memorandum to the imperial war conference in 1917 suggesting that an imperial organisation be constituted the suggestion was accepted and on 21 may 1917 the imperial war graves commission was established by royal charter with the prince of wales serving as president secretary of state for war lord derby as chairman and ware as vice-chairman the commission's undertakings began in earnest at the end of the first world war once land for cemeteries and memorials had been guaranteed the enormous task of recording the details of the dead could begin by 1918 some 587,000 graves had been identified and a further 559,000 casualties were registered as having no known grave
the scale and associated high number of casualties of the war produced an entirely new attitude towards the commemoration of war dead previous to world war i individual commemoration of war dead was often on an ad hoc basis and was almost exclusively limited to commissioned officers however the war required mobilisation of a significant percentage of the population either as volunteers or through conscription an expectation had consequently arisen that individual soldiers would expect to be commemorated even if they were low-ranking members of the military a committee under frederic kenyon director of the british museum presented a report to the commission in november 1918 detailing how it envisioned the development of the cemeteries two key elements of this report were that bodies should not be repatriated and that uniform memorials should be used to avoid class distinctions beyond the logistical nightmare of returning home so many corpses it was felt that repatriation would conflict with the feeling of brotherhood that had developed between serving ranks
an article in the times on 17 february 1919 by rudyard kipling carried the commission's proposal to a wider audience and described what the graves would look like the article entitled war graves work of imperial commission mr. kipling's survey was quickly republished as an illustrated booklet graves of the fallen the illustrated booklet was intended to soften the impact of kenyon's report as it included illustrations of cemeteries with mature trees and shrubs contrasting the bleak landscapes depicted in published battlefield photos there was an immediate public outcry following the publication of the reports particularly with regards to the decision to not repatriate the bodies of the dead the reports generated considerable discussion in the press which ultimately led to a heated debate in parliament on 4 may 1920 sir james remnant started the debate followed by speeches by william burdett-coutts in favour of the commission's principles and robert cecil speaking for those desiring repatriation and opposing uniformity of grave markers winston churchill closed the debate and asked that the issue not proceed to a vote remnant withdrew his motion allowing the commission to carry out its work assured of support for its principles
three of the most eminent architects of their day sir herbert baker sir reginald blomfield and sir edwin lutyens were commissioned to design the cemeteries and memorials rudyard kipling was appointed literary advisor for the language used for memorial inscriptions
in 1920 the commission built three experimental cemeteries at le treport forceville and louvencourt following the principles outlined in the kenyon report of these the forceville communal cemetery and extension was agreed to be the most successful having consulted with garden designer gertrude jekyll the architects created a walled cemetery with uniform headstones in a garden setting augmented by blomfield's cross of sacrifice and lutyens'stone of remembrance after some adjustments forceville became the template for the commission's building programme adjustments were required because all three experimental cemeteries went over budget to ensure future cemeteries remained within their budget the commission decided to not build shelters in cemeteries that contained less than 200 graves to not place a stone of remembrance in any cemetery with less than 400 graves and to limit the height of cemetery walls to 1 metre 3.3 ft
at the end of 1919 the commission had spent £ 7,500 and this figure rose to £ 250,000 in 1920 as construction of cemeteries and memorials increased by 1921 the commission had established 1,000 cemeteries which were ready for headstone erections and burials between 1920 and 1923 the commission was shipping 4,000 headstones a week to france in many cases small cemeteries were closed and the graves concentrated in larger ones by 1927 when the majority of construction had been completed over 500 cemeteries had been built with 400,000 headstones a thousand crosses of sacrifice and 400 stones of remembrance
the commission had also been mandated to individually commemorate each soldier who had no known grave which amounted to 315,000 in france and belgium alone the commission initially decided to build 12 monuments on which to commemorate the missing each memorial being located at the site of an important battle along the western front after resistance from the french committee responsible for the approvals of memorials on french territory the commission revised their plan and reduced the number of memorials and in some cases built memorials to the missing in existing cemeteries rather than as separate structures
reginald blomfield's menin gate was the first memorial to the missing located in europe to be completed and was unveiled on 24 july 1927 the menin gate menenpoort was found to have insufficient space to contain all the names as originally planned and 34,984 names of the missing were instead inscribed on herbert baker's tyne cot memorial to the missing other memorials followed the helles memorial in gallipoli designed by john james burnet the thiepval memorial on the somme and the arras memorial designed by edwin lutyens and the basra memorial in iraq designed by edward prioleau warren the dominions and india also erected memorials on which they commemorated their missing the neuve-chapelle memorial for the forces of india the vimy memorial by canada the villers-bretonneux memorial by australia the delville wood memorial by south africa and the beaumont-hamel memorial by newfoundland the programme of commemorating the dead of the great war was considered essentially complete with the inauguration of the thiepval memorial in 1932 though the vimy memorial would not be finished until 1936 the villers-bretonneux memorial until 1938 and stonemasons were still conducting work on the menin gate when germany invaded belgium in 1940
the only memorial created by the commission that was not in the form of a monument or cemetery was the opththalmic institute at giza egypt — complete with library and bacteriology and pathology departments — as its memorial to men of the egyptian labour corps and camel transport corps its erection was agreed with local political pressure
from the start of the second world war in 1939 the commission organised grave registration units and planning ahead based on the experience gained from the first world war earmarked land for use as cemeteries when the war began turning in favour of the allies the commission was able to begin restoring its first world war cemeteries and memorials it also began the task of commemorating the 600,000 commonwealth casualties from the second world war in 1949 the commission completed dieppe canadian war cemetery the first of 559 new cemeteries and 36 new memorials eventually over 350,000 new headstones were erected many were made from hopton wood stone the wider scale of world war ii coupled with manpower shortages and unrest in some countries meant that the construction and restoration programmes took much longer following the war the commission implemented a five-year horticultural renovation programme the horticultural neglect was largely addressed by 1950 but there were necessary structural repairs to be made these together with the backlog of maintenance tasks from before the war took a further 10 years to complete and the programme was not completed until the 1960s
with the increased number of civilian casualties compared with the world war i winston churchill agreed to ware's proposal that the commission also maintain a record of commonwealth civilian war deaths a supplemental chapter was added to the imperial war graves commission's charter on 7 february 1941 empowering the organisation to collect and record the names of civilians who died from enemy action during the second world war which resulted in the creation of the civilian war dead roll of honour the roll eventually contained the names of nearly 67,000 civilians the commission and the dean of westminster reached an agreement that the roll would eventually be placed in westminster abbey but not until the roll was complete and hostilities had ended the commission handed over the first six volumes to the dean of westminster on 21 february 1956 the final volume was added to the showcase in 1958
following world war ii the commission recognised that the word'imperial'within its name was no longer appropriate in the spirit of strengthening national and regional feelings the organisation's name was changed to commonwealth war graves commission in 1960
more recent conflicts have sometimes made it impossible for the commission to care for cemeteries in a given region or resulted in the destruction of sites altogether zehrensdorf indian cemetery in germany was unkempt after the end of world war ii and until the german reunification because it was located in an area occupied by russian forces and was not entirely rebuilt until 2005 the six-day war and war of attrition resulted in the destruction of port tewfik memorial and aden memorial and the death of a commission gardener at suez war memorial cemetery during the lebanese civil war two cemeteries in beirut were destroyed and had to be rebuilt the maintenance of war graves and memorials in iraq has remained difficult since iran–iraq war in the 1980s with regular maintenance being impractical since after the gulf war
the commission has and continues to also provide support for war graves outside its traditional mandate in 1982 the british ministry of defence requested the commission's assistance to design and construct cemeteries in the falkland islands for those killed during the falklands war although these cemeteries are not commonwealth war graves commission cemeteries the commission manages the administrative responsibilities of these cemeteries since 2005 the commission has carried out similar management duties on behalf of the british ministry of defence for cemeteries and graves of british and imperial soldiers who died during the second boer war in 2003 veterans affairs canada employed the commission to develop an approach to locate grave markers for which the canadian minister of veterans affairs has responsibility as of 2011 the commission conducts a twelve-year cyclical inspection programme of canadian veterans'markers installed at the expense of the government of canada
in 2008 an exploratory excavation discovered mass graves on the edge of pheasant wood outside of fromelles two-hundred and fifty british and australian bodies were excavated from five mass graves which were interred in the newly constructed fromelles pheasant wood military cemetery this was the first new commonwealth war graves commission cemetery in more than 50 years the last such cemeteries having been built after the second world war
the commission is currently responsible for the continued commemoration of 1.7 million deceased commonwealth military service members in 153 countries and approximately 67,000 civilians who died as a result of enemy action during world war ii commonwealth military service members are commemorated by name on either a headstone at an identified site of a burial or on a memorial as a result the commission is currently responsible for the care of war dead at over 23,000 separate burial sites and maintenance of more than 200 memorials worldwide the vast majority of burial sites are pre-existing communal or municipal cemeteries and parish churchyards located in the united kingdom however the commission has itself constructed approximately 2,500 war cemeteries worldwide the commission has also constructed or commissioned memorials to commemorate the dead who have no known grave the largest of these is the thiepval memorial
the commission only commemorates those who have died during the designated war years while in commonwealth military service or of causes attributable to service the applicable periods of consideration are 4 august 1914 to 31 august 1921 for the first world war and 3 september 1939 to 31 december 1947 for the second world war the end date for the first world war period is the official end of the war while for the second world war the commission selected a date approximately the same period after ve day as the official end of the first world war was after the 1918 armistice
civilians who died as a result of enemy action during the second world war are commemorated differently from those that died as a result of military service they are commemorated by name through the civilian war dead roll of honour located in st george's chapel in westminster abbey in addition to its mandated duties the commission maintains under arrangement with applicable governments over 40,000 non-commonwealth war graves and over 25,000 non-war military and civilian graves
as well as the main principal architects for france and belgium baker blomfield and lutyens there were principal architects appointed for other regions as well sir robert lorimer was principal architect for italy macedonia and egypt while sir john james burnet was principal architect for palestine and gallipoli assisted by thomas smith tait the principal architect for mesopotamia was edward prioleau warren
as well as these senior architects there was a team of assistant architects who were actually responsible for many of the cemetery and memorial designs these architects were younger and many of them had served in the war the assistant architects were george esselmont gordon leith wilfred clement von berg charles henry holden who in 1920 became a principal architect william harrison cowlishaw william bryce binnie george hartley goldsmith frank higginson arthur james scott hutton noel ackroyd rew and john reginald truelove other architects that worked for the commission or won competitions for the commission memorials included george salway nicol harold chalton bradshaw verner owen rees gordon h. holt and henry philip cart de lafontaine
in january 1944 edward maufe was appointed principal architect for the uk maufe worked extensively for the commission for 25 years until 1969 becoming chief architect and also succeeding kenyon as artistic advisor together with maufe the other principal architects appointed during and after the second world war were hubert worthington louis de soissons philip hepworth and colin st clair oakes
leading sculptors that worked on the memorials and cemeteries after the first world war included eric henri kennington charles thomas wheeler gilbert ledward and charles sargeant jagger other sculptors both in the inter-war period and after the second world war included william reid dick ernest gillick basil gotto alfred turner laurence a. turner walter gilbert henry poole vernon hill robert anning bell ferdinand victor blundstone joseph armitage and gilbert bayes
structural design has always played an important part in the commission's cemeteries apart from a few exceptions due to local geological conditions the cemeteries follow the same design and uniform aesthetic all over the world this makes the cemeteries easily recognisable and distinguishes them from war graves administered by other groups or countries
a typical cemetery is surrounded by a low wall or hedge and with a wrought-iron gate entrance for cemeteries in france and belgium a land tablet near the entrance or along a wall identifies the cemetery grounds as having been provided by the french or belgian governments all but the smallest cemeteries contain a register with an inventory of the burials a plan of the plots and rows and a basic history of the cemetery the register is located within a metal cupboard that is marked with a cross located in either the wall near the cemetery entrance or in a shelter within the cemetery more recently in larger sites a stainless steel notice gives details of the respective military campaign the headstones within the cemetery are of a uniform size and design and mark plots of equal size
the cemetery grounds are except in drier climates grass covered with a floral border around the headstones there is also an absence of any paving between the headstone rows which is intended to make the cemetery feel like a traditional walled garden where visitors could experience a sense of peace however carter and jackson argue that the uniform aesthetics are designed to evoke a positive experience which deliberately masks and sanitises the nature of the war deaths
typically cemeteries of more than 40 graves contain a cross of sacrifice designed by architect reginald blomfield this cross was designed to imitate medieval crosses found in churchyards in england with proportions more commonly seen in the celtic cross the cross is normally a freestanding four-point limestone latin cross mounted on an octagonal base and ranging in height from 14 to 32 feet a bronze longsword blade down is embedded on the face of the cross this cross represents the faith of the majority of the dead and the sword represents the military character of the cemetery intended to link british soldiers and the christian concept of self-sacrifice
cemeteries with more than 1000 burials typically have a stone of remembrance designed by edwin lutyens with the inscription their name liveth for evermore the concept of the stone of remembrance stone was developed by rudyard kipling to commemorate those of all faiths and none respectively in contrast to the cross of sacrifice the design for the stone deliberately avoided shapes associated with particular religions the geometry of the structure was based on studies of the parthenon each stone is 3.5 metres 11 ft long and 1.5 metres 4.9 ft high the shape of the stone has been compared both to that of a sarcophagus and an altar the feature was designed using the principle of entasis the subtle curves in the design if extended would form a sphere 1,801 feet 8 inches 549.15 m in diameter
every grave is marked with a headstone each headstone contains the national emblem or regimental badge rank name unit date of death and age of each casualty inscribed above an appropriate religious symbol and a more personal dedication chosen by relatives the headstones use a standard upper case lettering designed by macdonald gill individual graves are arranged where possible in straight rows and marked by uniform headstones the vast majority of which are made of portland stone the original headstone dimensions were 76 centimetres 30 in tall 38 cm 15 in wide and 7.6 cm 3.0 in thick
most headstones are inscribed with a cross except for those deceased known to be atheist or non-christian in the case of burials of victoria cross or george cross recipients the regimental badge is supplemented by the victoria cross or george cross emblem sometimes a soldier employed a pseudonym because they were too young to serve or were sought by law enforcement in such cases their primary name is shown along with the notation served as many headstones are for unidentified casualties they consequently bear only what could be discovered from the body the epitaph developed by rudyard kipling that appears on the graves of unidentified soldiers for which no details are known is a soldier of the great war known unto god some headstones bear the text believed to be buried in this cemetery when they are believed to be buried in the cemetery but the exact location of the grave is not known in some cases soldiers were buried in collective graves and distinguishing one body from another was not possible and thus one headstone covers more than one grave the headstone does not denote any specific details of the death except for its date and even then only if it is known and are deliberately ambiguous about the cause of death
due to local conditions it was sometimes necessary for the commission to deviate from its standard design in places prone to extreme weather or earthquakes such as thailand and turkey stone-faced pedestal markers are used instead of the normal headstones these measures are intended to prevent masonry being damaged during earthquakes or sinking into sodden ground in italy headstones were carved from chiampo perla limestone because it was in more plentiful supply in struma military cemetery in greece to avoid risk of earthquake damage small headstones are laid flat on the ground the smaller size of the markers mean that they often lack unit insignia
commission cemeteries are distinctive in treating floriculture as an integral part of the cemetery design originally the horticultural concept was to create an environment where visitors could experience a sense of peace in a setting in contrast to traditionally bleak graveyards recommendations given by arthur william hill the assistant director of the royal botanical gardens at kew enabled the commission to develop cemetery layouts and architectural structures that took into account the placement of suitable plant life combining structural and horticultural elements was not unfamiliar to the commission's architects sir edwin lutyens furthered his long-standing working relationship with horticulturist gertrude jekyll whose devotion to traditional cottage garden plants and roses greatly influenced the appearance of the cemeteries where possible indigenous plants were utilised to enhance sentimental associations with the gardens of home
variety in texture height and timing of floral display were equally important horticultural considerations the beds around each headstone are planted with a mixture of floribunda roses and herbaceous perennials low-growing plants are chosen for areas immediately in front of headstones ensuring that inscriptions are not obscured and preventing soil from splashing back during rain in cemeteries where there are pedestal grave markers dwarf varieties of plants are used instead
the absence of any form of paving between the headstone rows contributes to the simplicity of the cemetery designs lawn paths add to the garden ambiance and are irrigated during the dry season in countries where there is insufficient rain where irrigation is inappropriate or impractical dry landscaping is an ecological alternative favoured by the commission's horticulturists as is the case in iraq drier areas require a different approach not only for lawns but also to plants and styles of planting similarly there are separate horticultural considerations in tropical climates when many cemeteries are concentrated within a limited area like along the western front or gallipoli peninsula mobile teams of gardeners operate from a local base elsewhere larger cemeteries have their own dedicated staff while small cemeteries are usually tended by a single gardener working part-time

the cwgc's work is funded predominantly by grants from the governments of the six member states in the fiscal year 2012 13 these grants amounted to £ 58.6 million of the organisation's £ 66.5 million of income this equates to an approximate cost of c 85 per commemorated war dead the contribution from each country is proportionate to the number of graves the cwgc maintains on behalf of that country the percentage of total annual contributions for which each country is responsible is united kingdom 78.4 canada 10.1 australia 6.1 new zealand 2.1 south africa 2.1 and india 1.2
a project is underway to photograph the graves of and memorials to all service personnel from 1914 to the present day and make the images available to the public the work is being carried out by the war graves photographic project in conjunction with the cwgc as of august 2013 the project has recorded 1.7 million photographs for posterity
immediately following the first world war the british army remained responsible for the exhumation of remains the western front was divided into sectors and combed for bodies by 12-man exhumation units between the armistice and september 1921 the exhumation units reburied 204,695 bodies after 1921 no further widespread search for bodies was undertaken and in february 1921 responsibility of the cemeteries was transferred to the commission despite the rigorous searches bodies continued to be discovered in numbers in the three years following the conclusion of the general search 38,000 bodies were discovered in the mid 1920s 20 to 30 bodies were being discovered weekly
the discovery of remains of first and second world war casualties remains a common occurrence with approximately 30 bodies discovered annually for example in 2006 eight bodies of canadian soldiers from the 78th battalion winnipeg grenadiers cef were discovered in a backyard in hallu france in april 2013 the remains of four british soldiers discovered by a french farmer clearing land with metal detector in 2009 were re-interred at h.a.c. cemetery near arras france in march 2014 the remains of 20 commonwealth and 30 german soldiers were discovered in vendin-le-vieil france with the commonwealth soldiers being subsequently reburied at loos british cemetery
when the remains of a commonwealth soldier from the first or second world war is discovered the commission is notified and a commission burial officer tries to collect any associated artifacts that may help in identify the remains the details are then registered and archived at the commission's headquarters. the collection of evidence can include artifacts with the remains anthropological data and dna the archival records of the commission are open to the public to permit individuals to conduct their own research investigation of archival records by members of the public periodically result in the identification of previously buried casualties in december 2013 it was discovered that second lieutenant philip frederick cormack who was previously commemorated on the arras flying services memorial had in fact been buried in a french military cemetery in machelen east-flanders in belgium sergeant leonard maidment was identified in 2013 after a visitor to marfaux british cemetery discovered a headstone of an unknown sergeant with the hampshire regiment killed on 20 july 1918 and was subsequently able to show that only one sergeant from that regiment had been killed in france on that date
cemeteries including those of war dead are targets for vandalism the gravestones cemeteries and buildings of the commission are no exception the commission believes that graffiti and damage to stonework are usually the pursuits partaken by young people noting the number of incidents increases when schoolchildren are on school holidays determined thieves will also steal the bronze swords off the cross of sacrifice which are now replaced with identical ones made in fibreglass
the vandalism of commission cemeteries has also been connected to the participation of commonwealth countries in contemporary conflicts in the 1970s in the troubles commission cemeteries in ireland experienced vandalism vandals defaced the central memorial of the étaples military cemetery in northern france with anti-british and anti-american graffiti on 20 march 2003 immediately after the beginning of the iraq war on 9 may 2004 thirty-three headstones were demolished in the gaza cemetery which contains 3,691 graves allegedly in retaliation for the abu ghraib prisoner abuse scandal on 24 february 2012 during the libyan civil war an islamist militia damaged over 200 headstones in the benghazi war cemetery as well as the central memorial
tatwine or tatwin tatuini or tadwinus c 670–734 was the tenth archbishop of canterbury from 731 to 734 prior to becoming archbishop he was a monk and abbot of a benedictine monastery besides his ecclesiastical career tatwine was a writer and riddles he composed survive another work he composed was on the grammar of the latin language which was aimed at advanced students of that language he was subsequently considered a saint
tatwine was a mercian by birth his epigraph at canterbury stated that when he died he was in old age so perhaps he was born around 670 he became a monk at the monastery at breedon-on-the-hill in the present-day county of leicestershire and then abbot of that house through the influence of king æthelbald he was appointed as archbishop of canterbury in 731 and was consecrated on 10 june 731 he was one of a number of mercians who were appointed to canterbury during the 730s and 740s apart from his consecration of the bishops of lindsey and selsey in 733 tatwine's period as archbishop appears to have been uneventful he died in office on 30 july 734 later considered a saint his feast day is 30 july
bede's commentary on tatwine calls him a vir religione et prudentia insignis sacris quoque literis nobiliter instructus a man notable for his prudence devotion and learning these qualities were displayed in the two surviving manuscripts of his riddles and four of his ars tatuini the ars is one of only two surviving 8th-century latin grammars from england and was based on the works of priscian and consentius the riddles deal with such diverse topics as philosophy and charity the five senses and the alphabet and a book and a pen the riddles are formed in acrostics the grammar is a reworking of donatus's ars minor with the addition of information drawn from other grammarians it was not designed for a newcomer to the latin language but is designed for more advanced students it covers the eight parts of speech through illustrations drawn from classical scholars although not directly but through other grammatical works there are also some examples drawn from the psalms the work was completed before he became archbishop and was used not only in england but also on the continent a recent edition of his works is tatuini opera omnia published in 1968 with some translations into english and german from the original latin
the type ub i was a class of small coastal submarines u-boats built in germany at the beginning of the first world war 20 boats were constructed most of which went into service with the german imperial navy boats of this design were also operated by the austro-hungarian navy kaiserliche und königliche kriegsmarine or k.u.k. kriegsmarine and the bulgarian navy the group is sometimes known as the ub-1 class after sm ub-1 the class leader in the austro-hungarian navy it was called the u-10 class
built to meet the need for small maneuverable submarines able to operate in the narrow shallow seas off flanders the vessels were intended to be quickly constructed then shipped by rail and assembled at their port of operation the design effort began in mid-august 1914 and by mid-october the first 15 boats were ordered from two german shipyards the german imperial navy subsequently ordered an additional pair of boats to replace two sold to austria-hungary who ordered a further three boats in april 1915 a total of 20 ub is were built construction of the first boats for germany began in early november 1914 all 20 were completed by october 1915 several of the first boats underwent trials in german home waters but the rest were assembled and tested at either antwerp or pola the german boats operated primarily in the flanders baltic and constantinople flotillas the boats were about 28 metres 92 ft long and displaced 127 tonnes 125 long tons when surfaced and 142 tonnes 140 long tons while submerged all had two bow torpedo tubes and two torpedoes and were equipped with a deck-mounted machine gun
in 1918 four of the surviving german boats were converted into coastal minelayers of the seventeen boats in german service two were sold to austria-hungary one was sold to bulgaria and nine were lost during the war one of the five austro-hungarian boats was sunk and another mined and not repaired the five surviving german boats the four surviving austro-hungarian boats and the bulgarian boat were all turned over to the allies after the end of the war and were broken up
in the earliest stages of the first world war the german army's rapid advance along the north sea coast found the german imperial navy without submarines suitable to operate in the narrow and shallow seas off flanders by 18 august 1914 two weeks after the german invasion of belgium the planning of a series of small coastal submarines had already begun
the german imperial navy stipulated that the submarines must be transportable by rail which imposed a maximum diameter of 3.15 metres 10 ft 4 in the rushed planning effort — which had been assigned the name project 34 — resulted in the type ub i design created specifically for operation from flanders the boats were to be about 28 metres 92 ft long and to displace about 125 tonnes 123 long tons with two bow torpedo tubes
boats of the type ub i design were built by two manufacturers germaniawerft of kiel and ag weser of bremen which led to some variations in boats from the two shipyards the eight germaniawerft-built boats were slightly longer at 28.10 metres 92 ft 2 in length overall while the twelve weser-built boats came in 22 centimetres 8.7 in shorter than their counterparts all were 3.15 metres 10 ft 4 in abeam and had a draft of 3.03 metres 9 ft 11 in the boats all displaced 127 tonnes 125 long tons while surfaced but differed slightly in displacement submerged the slightly longer germaniawerft boats displaced 142 tonnes 140 long tons while submerged as they weighed 1 tonne 0.98 long tons more than the weser boats
the drivetrain of the boats consisted of a single propeller shaft driven by a daimler germaniawerft or körting weser diesel engine on the surface or a siemens-schuckert electric motor for underwater travel the weser boats were capable of nearly 7.5 knots 13.9 km h 8.6 mph on the surface and a little more than 6 knots 11 km h 6.9 mph submerged the germaniawerft boats were about 1 knot 1.9 km h 1.2 mph slower than their bremen-made counterparts the boats were equipped with two 45-centimetre 17.7 in bow torpedo tubes and carried two torpedoes they were also armed with a single 8-millimetre 0.31 in machine gun affixed to the deck
the german imperial navy ordered its first fifteen type ub i boats on 15 october 1914 eight boats — numbered ub-1 to ub-8 — were ordered from germaniawerft of kiel and seven boats — numbered ub-9 to u-15 — from ag weser of bremen after two of the class ub-1 and ub-15 were sold in february 1915 to ally austria-hungary becoming u-10 and u-11 in the austro-hungarian navy the german imperial navy ordered ub-16 and ub-17 from weser a further three for austria-hungary — u-15 u-16 and u-17 — had been ordered from weser by april bringing the total number constructed to 20
ub-1 and ub-2 were laid down on 1 november 1914 at the germaniawerft yard at kiel ub-1 was launched on 22 january 1915 just 75 working days later ub-2's launch followed on 13 february among the weser boats ub-9 was laid down first on 6 november 1914 and launched on 6 february 1915 a week ahead of ub-2 these first three boats launched underwent trials in home waters but most of the other members of the class were shipped via rail and underwent trials at their assembly point
the process of shipping the submarines by rail involved breaking the submarines down into what was essentially a knock down kit each boat was broken into approximately fifteen pieces and loaded on to eight railway flatcars type ub i boats destined for service with the flanders flotilla made a five-day journey to antwerp for the two- to three-week assembly process after assembly at antwerp the boats were towed by barge to bruges for trials boats selected for service in the mediterranean were sent to the austro-hungarian port of pola for assembly the total time from departure of the railcars from the shipyard to operational readiness for the boats was about six weeks
by july 1915 all seventeen of the german imperial navy type ub is had been completed
during their trials the type ub is were found to be too small and too slow and had a reputation for being underpowered one commander compared his type ub i to a sewing machine according to authors r. h. gibson and maurice prendergast in their 1931 book the german submarine war 1914–1918 the ubs did not have enough power to chase down steamers while surfaced and lacked the endurance to spend any extended amount of time underwater exhausting their batteries after little over an hour's running in-service use revealed another problem with a single propeller shaft engine combination if either component failed the u-boat was almost totally disabled
another reported problem with the type ub is was the tendency to break trim after the firing of torpedoes the boats were equipped with compensating tanks designed to flood and offset the loss of the c 06 torpedo's 1,700-pound 770 kg weight but this system did not always function properly as a result when firing from periscope depth the boat could broach after firing or if too much weight was taken on plunge to the depths when ub-15 torpedoed and sank italian submarine medusa in june 1915 the tank failed to properly compensate forcing the entire crew to run to the stern to offset the trim imbalance
despite the problems the tin tadpoles as the germans referred to them were in active service from march 1915 through the end of the war with half of the 20 boats lost during the war boats of the class served in three navies the german imperial navy the austro-hungarian navy and the bulgarian navy in german service they served primarily in the flanders flotilla the baltic flotilla and the constantinople flotilla
the first type ub i to enter service was ub-10 which formed the nucleus of the flanders flotilla on 27 march 1915 by the end of april five more type ub i boats had become operational ub-10 was eventually joined in the flanders flotilla by ub-2 ub-4 ub-5 ub-6 ub-12 ub-13 ub-16 and ub-17 of these only ub-2 made the journey to flanders by sea rather than rail
ub-4 departed on the first patrol from flanders on 9 april and was responsible for sinking the first ship sent down by the flotilla the type ub i boats of the flanders flotilla originally patrolled the area between the united kingdom and the netherlands but began patrolling the english channel after ub-6 pioneered a route past british antisubmarine nets and mines in the straits of dover in late june
over the type ub is'first year of service ub-4 and ub-13 were both lost and ub-2 and ub-5 were transferred to the baltic flotilla in march 1917 ub-6 ran aground in dutch waters and was interned for the rest of the war along with her crew the four remaining type ub is in flanders — ub-10 ub-12 ub-16 ub-17 — were all converted to minelayers by 1918 having their torpedo tubes removed and replaced with chutes to carry up to eight mines all but ub-10 were lost in 1918 ub-10 in poor repair and out of service was scuttled in october 1918 when the germans evacuated from flanders
ub-9 was initially assigned to the baltic flotilla and was joined by ub-2 and ub-5 in early 1916 all three became training boats at kiel in 1916 joining ub-11 in that duty little information is available about the type ub i boats operating in the baltic
four of the german imperial navy boats — ub-3 ub-7 ub-8 and ub-14 — were selected for service with the constantinople flotilla all were sent to pola for assembly and trials there as part of the pola flotilla before sailing on to join the constantinople flotilla ub-3 disappeared en route to constantinople in may 1915 but the other three arrived there by mid-june
the three type ub i boats of the constantinople flotilla seem to have patrolled primarily in the black sea ub-8 was transferred to the bulgarian navy in may 1916 and ub-7 disappeared in the black sea in october 1916 leaving ub-14 as the sole remaining german type ub i in the flotilla she was surrendered at sevastopol in november 1918 to french armies stationed there during the russian civil war
ub-1 and the still incomplete ub-15 were sold to the austria-hungary in february 1915 both were dismantled and shipped to pola in may after one cruise under the german flag each boat was commissioned into the austro-hungarian navy the pair — renamed u-10 and u-11 respectively — were joined by u-15 u-16 and u-17 in october known as the u-10 or the okarina english ocarina class as a part of the austro-hungarian navy the five boats operated primarily in the adriatic in patrols off italy and albania u-10 ex ub-1 hit a mine in july 1918 and was beached but had not been repaired by the end of the war u-16 was sunk after she torpedoed an italian destroyer in october 1916 and the remaining three and the unrepaired u-10 were ceded to italy at the end of the war
after ub-8 was transferred to the bulgarian navy in may 1916 she was renamed podvodnik no. 18 in cyrillic пoдвoдник no. 18 she was bulgaria's first submarine and was engaged primarily in coastal defense duties off bulgaria's main black sea port of varna podvodnik no. 18 survived the war and was ceded to france after the treaty of neuilly-sur-seine
20 type ub i submarines were built 17 for the german imperial navy and three for the austro-hungarian navy two of the german submarines — ub-1 and ub-15 — were sold to austria-hungary and commissioned into the austro-hungarian navy as u-10 and u-11 respectively those two and a further three built by ag weser comprised the virtually identical u-10 class for the austro-hungarian navy another of the german submarines ub-8 was sold to bulgaria in may 1916 becoming podvodnik no. 18

in the austro-hungarian navy the type ub i boats were known as the u-10 class which consisted of two former german type ub i boats and three built specifically for austria-hungary
sm u-10 the former german ub-1
sm u-11 the former german ub-15
sm u-15 austria-hungary
sm u-16 austria-hungary
sm u-17 austria-hungary
in addition four of the german type ub is assigned to the pola flotilla based at the austro-hungarian navy's main naval base at pola were assigned austro-hungarian designations
sm ub-3 as u-9
sm ub-7 as u-7
sm ub-8 as u-8
sm ub-14 as u-26
these four boats remained under commission in the german imperial navy retained german crews and commanders and received orders from the german flotilla commander at pola
germany and bulgaria negotiated the purchase of two ub i boats for the bulgarian navy ub-7 and ub-8 in 1916 two crews of bulgarian sailors were sent to kiel for training before the purchase could be completed ub-7 was sunk leaving only one boat for bulgaria on 25 may 1916 ub-8 was officially transferred to bulgaria for the remainder of the war

the military history of gibraltar during world war ii exemplifies gibraltar's position as a british fortress since the early 18th century and as a vital factor in british military strategy both as a foothold on the continent of europe and as a bastion of british sea power during world war ii gibraltar served a vital role in both the atlantic theatre and the mediterranean theatre controlling virtually all naval traffic into and out of the mediterranean sea from the atlantic ocean
in addition to its commanding position gibraltar provided a strongly defended harbour from which ships could operate in both the atlantic and the mediterranean force h under the command of vice-admiral james somerville was based in gibraltar and had the task of maintaining naval superiority and providing a strong escort for convoys to and from the besieged island of malta during the course of the war gibraltar came under aerial bombardment from vichy french aircraft and from aircraft of the italian royal air force regia aeronautica based on sardinia additionally the fortress was the focus of underwater attacks by the italian royal navy regia marina commando frogman unit decima flottiglia mas and their human torpedoes this italian unit was based on the interned italian ship ss olterra in the nearby spanish harbour of algeciras a number of attacks were also carried out by spanish and gibraltarian agents acting on behalf of the german abwehr
inside the rock of gibraltar itself miles of tunnels were excavated from the limestone masses of rock were blasted out to build an underground city in huge man-made caverns barracks offices and a fully equipped hospital were constructed complete with an operating theatre and x-ray equipment
operation torch the allied invasion of french north africa in november 1942 was coordinated from the rock general dwight d. eisenhower who was given command of the operation set up his headquarters in gibraltar during the planning phases of the operation following the successful completion of the north african campaign and the surrender of italy in 1943 gibraltar's role shifted from a forward operating base to a rear-area supply position the harbour continued to operate dry docks and supply depots for the convoy routes through the mediterranean until v-e day in 1945
world war ii dramatically changed the lives of gibraltarians the decision to enforce mass evacuation in order to increase the strength of the rock with more military and naval personnel meant that most gibraltarians some for up to ten years had nowhere to call'home'. only those civilians with essential jobs were allowed to stay but it gave the entire community a sense of being'british'by sharing in the war effort
in early june 1940 about 13,500 evacuees were shipped to casablanca in french morocco however following the capitulation of the french to the german armies later in june 1940 the new pro-german french vichy government found the presence of gibraltarian evacuees in casablanca an embarrassment and sought opportunities for their removal the opportunity soon arose when 15 british cargo vessels arrived under commodore crichton repatriating 15,000 french servicemen who had been rescued from dunkirk once their own rescued servicemen had disembarked the ships were interned until they agreed to take away all the evacuees although crichton was unable to obtain permission to clean and restock his ships and contrary to british admiralty orders which forbade the taking on of evacuees when he saw the mass of civilians pouring through the dockyards he opened up his gangways for boarding just beforehand the british fleet had destroyed a number of french warships at mers el-kebir in order to prevent them ending up in german hands the attack during which 1,297 french sailors died led to high tensions which were evident when families were forced at bayonet point by french troops to board taking only what they could carry leaving many possessions behind however when they arrived at gibraltar the governor would not allow them to land fearing that once the evacuees were back on the rock it would be virtually impossible to evacuate them a second time crowds gathered in john mackintosh square in the centre of gibraltar as the news broke speeches were made and two city councillors accompanied by the acting president of the exchange and commercial library went to see the governor sir clive liddell to ask that the evacuees be allowed to land after receiving instructions from london a landing was allowed as long as the evacuees returned when other ships arrived to take them away from the rock and by 13 july the re-evacuation back to gibraltar had been completed
british conservative politician oliver stanley agreed to accept the evacuees in the united kingdom but he argued with gibraltar over the number of people involved the governor he declared had given the number of evacuees first as 13,000 then as 14,000 and finally as 16,000 he asked for the situation to be clarified stressing the shortage of accommodation in britain and insisting that only 13,000 could be accepted 2,000 of whom were to be sent to the portuguese atlantic island of madeira the situation replied general liddell on 19 july is that this is a fortress liable to heavy and immediate attack and there should be no civilians here whereas there are 22,000 the 13,000 was the number sent to morocco and more would have been sent had the situation there not altered in london the evacuees were placed in the hands of the ministry of health and many were housed in kensington area concern for them in gibraltar mounted as the air raids against london intensified coupled with the arrival of harrowing letters describing the circumstances in which the evacuees were living
in september rumours were already circulating among the evacuees and in gibraltar that the possibility of re-evacuating the gibraltarians once more was being mooted this time the destination being jamaica in the west indies after much contention it was decided to send a party directly from gibraltar to the island and 1,093 evacuees left for jamaica direct on 9 october with more following later on however petitions followed and the demands were met partly for strategic reasons and the lack of available shipping the situation at the end of 1940 therefore was that approximately 2,000 evacuees were in jamaica and a lesser number in madeira with the bulk of around 10,000 housed in the london area
construction of a solid surface runway began in late 1939 and in 1940 it was proposed to extend the existing runway to a length of 1,550 yards 1,417 m the land reclamation commenced towards the end of 1941 along with the construction of an raf camp at the north front now raf gibraltar the raf dispatched their next squadron to gibraltar at this time and it was in september 1939 that war with germany was declared and the strong possibility of german submarines concentrating in the strait of gibraltar and using spanish port facilities loomed large in admiralty thinking so at 09 00 utc on the 9 september 1939 no. 202 squadron raf was ordered to gibraltar loaded to the gunwales with equipment
on 25 september 1939 no 200 coastal group was formed as a subordinate formation to hq raf mediterranean in control of no 202 sqn the group's function was the control of royal air force units operating from gibraltar in late 1940 the group was transferred to coastal command later a combined hq was formed which commenced operations in early 1942
on 18 july 1940 after the attack on the french fleet at mers-el-kébir by the british the vichy government authorized a bombing raid of gibraltar as a response little damage was reported to have been done
on tuesday 24 september the italian stefani news agency reported as a reprisal for the bombardment of dakar yesterday morning one-hundred-and-twenty french aircraft based in morocco attacked gibraltar on the same day the united press agency reported the french government has issued an official denial of reports according to which french aircraft were said to have attacked gibraltar up until now no reprisals have been undertaken but the united press report ended on an ominous note with french reprisals are imminent
again on the same day the vichy french government issued orders for the naval base and city of gibraltar to be bombarded as a result six bomber squadrons of the vichy french air force armée de l 'air de vichy and four squadrons of the vichy french navy marine nationale de vichy were employed in the operation the 64 bombers flew from bases in oran tafaroui in algeria meknes mediouna and port lyautey in morocco the french action was approved by both the german armistice commission and the italian armistice commission
no british aircraft were encountered and much damage was done in the area south of the fortress the south mole and a large ship in the harbour were heavily damaged in the northern part of gibraltar fires broke out
on 25 september the french returned with a larger force of eighty-three bombers to cause additional damage to the naval base and harbour installations again aircraft of the british royal air force made no appearance however the french crews did report encountering heavy anti-aircraft fire one leo 451 bomber was lost and 13 other aircraft were lightly damaged during the two days of bombing attacks the british armed trawler hmt stella sirius was sunk by bombs
the air attack on 25 september was the last by vichy forces on gibraltar
the rock came through the war relatively unscathed but given its strategic importance germany made plans to capture gibraltar codenamed felix the plan which was signed by adolf hitler himself was formulated at the highest level of command with or without permission germany would take entry through spain and attack gibraltar driving the british out of the western mediterranean the strait would be effectively closed to the allies once gibraltar was in german hands forcing asia-bound allied shipping to steam all the way around africa rather than to proceed to the east via the shorter route through the mediterranean and the suez canal the rock was to be heavily dive bombed by planes leaving france but landing afterward at spanish air bases to deny a possible spanish capture of the base the german planners decided that the final attack to seize gibraltar was to be made by german troops alone
diplomatic failure at the highest levels of government prevented the operation from occurring at the beginning of 1941 which had been drawn up in detail by the wehrmacht in the summer and autumn of 1940
general ludwig kübler's xlix corps would conduct the actual attack on the rock the assault forces would comprise the infantry regiment großdeutschland the 98th regiment of the 1st mountain division 26 medium and heavy artillery battalions three observation battalions three engineer battalions two smoke battalions a detachment of 150 brandenburgers and up to 150 miniature remote controlled demolition vehicles goliaths packed with high explosives
as part of a combined-force operation the german air force luftwaffe would contribute ju 88as stukas messerschmitts three light aa battalions and three heavy aa battalions nazi germany's kriegsmarine would cooperate by using u-boats to interfere with british naval movement and emplacing coastal batteries to further discourage the royal navy
on 10 march 1941 with operation barbarossa looming felix was amended to operation felix-heinrich whereby german troops would be withdrawn from the ussr to capture gibraltar as a result of spanish dictator francisco franco's intransigence the operation was postponed modified and ultimately abandoned
from sardinia italian piaggio p.108 bombers attacked gibraltar several times mainly in 1942 the last raids on gibraltar were done during the 1943 allied landing in algeria when those bombers hit successfully even the oran port
the only unit of the regia aeronautica royal air force ever to fly the piaggio p.108 was the 274th long-range bombardment squadron this unit was formed in may 1941 around the first machines that came off the assembly lines the training of the crews lasted far longer than anticipated and only in june 1942 the 274th became operational the most spectacular raids with the p. 108 bombers were flown in october 1942 when several night attacks against gibraltar were undertaken from sardinia
after the armistice of cassibile 8 september the german-allied italian social republic launched at least two raids on gibraltar one on the night of 4–5 june 1944 with ten sm.79bis aircraft and another on 6 june with nine aircraft both sorties were undertaken by the gruppo aerosiluranti buscaglia–faggioni
known as the floating trojan horse of gibraltar decima flottiglia mas an italian commando frogman unit created during the fascist government engaged in numerous attacks against the harbour at gibraltar
gibraltar was a very tempting target for the italians who saw it as a refuge for british warships and allied merchant shipping the italian frogmen originally used a spanish villa villa carmela located two miles 3 km from gibraltar owned by an italian officer who had married a spanish woman named conchita ramognino their base was shifted later to the italian tanker ss olterra interned in algeciras
lesser known than the italian actions were the sabotage operations and limpet-mine attacks carried out by spanish and gibraltarian agents recruited in the campo de gibraltar by the germans the abwehr contacted a spanish staff officer from campo de gibraltar lieutenant colonel eleuterio sánchez rubio a spanish officer member of the falange and coordinator of the intelligence operations in the campo to establish a network of saboteurs with access to gibraltar sánchez rubio designated emilio plazas tejera also a member of falange as operations chief of the organisation most of the recruits for the sabotage operations were spaniards from the campo a combination of financial reward ideological commitment and some threats and intimidation were used to gather a significant number of agents according to the british intelligence there were at least 183 spaniards and gibraltarians involved in the espionage and sabotage operations against gibraltar
sabotage operations were ordered from berlin in the late autumn of 1940 but actual work did not start until early 1941 the first operations were unsuccessful a first attempt to smuggle a bomb into gibraltar was aborted as the timing device was faulty in february there was a large explosion in the north tunnel and in april a bomb blew up near the airfield in june 1941 however the british intelligence foiled a new attempt by a german agent to attach a mine alongside an allied cargo ship another attempt failed when plazas placed a bomb inside an ammunition store but was not able to bring the explosive it was not until 1942 that the operations begun to succeed in january 1942 two spanish agents manage to destroy two aircraft at the north front landing strip
financed trained and equipped by the germans the saboteurs sank the armed trawler hmt erin and destroyed the auxiliary minesweeper hmt honju which resulted in the deaths of six british seamen on 18 january 1942 plazas was assisted by the spanish naval commander of puente mayorga manuel romero hume who allowed him to beach a rowboat there the british intelligence was able however to counteract the sabotage operations in march 1942 a gibraltarian josé key one of the most prominent agents working for the germans responsible for the collection of information on military movements for the abwehr was arrested and executed in wandsworth prison in late 1942 by september 1942 plazas whose activities were closely monitored by the british at that time resigned and left carlos calvo his second in command in charge of the operations in late 1942 the german headquarters in berlin ordered the sabotage operations being expanded in early 1943 the arrival of an experienced head of abwehr operations in spain improved the outreach of the operations
in march 1943 an ammunition dump was blown up by calvo's agents the british growing suspicious of some of the saboteurs banned them from entering gibraltar this forced the abwehr to ask calvo for new personnel a spaniard working on the rock josé martín muñoz was responsible for the explosion and fire at a large fuel tank at coaling island on 30 june 1943 this mission however would be the first and the last for muñoz because he was cornered and arrested by british authorities in august when he tried to smuggle a bomb into a weapons magazine inside ragged staff cave after being sentenced to death he was hanged on 11 january 1944 in gibraltar by british executioner albert pierrepoint a member of an unrelated abwehr sabotage network luis lópez cordón-cuenca also arrested in 1943 was executed by pierrepoint on the same day calvo himself was put under arrest by the spanish police and neutralized he would be a free man again in december when he rejoined the abwehr in madrid under direct orders of wolfgang blaum aka baumann head of the sabotage section in spain after a falangist attempt against the life of pro-allied general josé enrique varela perpetrated by sánchez rubio network's agent juan josé domínguez and a meeting between anthony eden and the spanish ambassador at london jacobo fitz-james stuart abwehr activities around gibraltar came to an end
operation tracer was a top-secret british stay-behind spying mission that was only to be implemented if gibraltar was captured by the axis powers six men were to be sealed in a cave and left with only enough supplies for a year the volunteers — two doctors three signalmen and their leader — would run an observation post with one 12-inch 300 mm by 6-inch 150 mm slit looking over the harbour and a concealed outdoor terrace over the mediterranean the team would then wire back all shipping movements to the british admiralty
they were told there would be no way out and anyone who died within the chamber would have to be embalmed and cemented into the brick floor only if germany was defeated within their first year would they be released
as the threat of invasion was clearly felt in late 1941 an idea for a series of secret observation posts first in gibraltar and later in other places like malta and aden was put together under operation tracer
work in gibraltar began immediately under commander geoffrey birley and his chief engineer colonel fordham the site chosen at lord airey's battery on the southern tip of the rock already had an existing tunnelling scheme for a shelter extensive trials of the equipment began in january 1942 under the eye of mi6 radio expert colonel richard gambier-parry much thought was also given to the type of men needed for such a strange and demanding task a member of scott ’ s ill-fated expedition to the antarctic george murray levick was called up as surgeon-commander to advise on survival techniques there were practical matters such as diet exercise sanitation and clothing to consider as well as vital psychology of the personnel the full team was in place by the end of summer 1942 and their cavern fully equipped and ready for occupation a comprehensive manual was prepared on all aspects of the operation and it was considered that similar secret lookout posts should be prepared throughout the world in the event of future wars however operation tracer was never needed as adolf hitler turned his attention away from gibraltar and towards the eastern front
the operation had been clouded in mystery until the discovery of papers at the public record office in kew uk previously in the 1960s details of the story were told to a journalist by his intelligence service contacts and he wrote these up as operation monkey yet facts were very sparse
in 1997 stay behind cave as it was nicknamed was discovered in gibraltar by the gibraltar caving group but no account was ever obtained from anyone associated with the mission the discovery came about when the group encountered a strong gust of wind in a tunnel further searching led them to break through a wall into chambers which had never been used and had remained sealed for over 50 years
in november 2006 jim crone and sergeant major pete jackson senior tunnel guide with the royal gibraltar regiment met possibly the only member of operation tracer still alive when they travelled to meet dr. w. a. bruce cooper at his home in england cooper 92 at the time provided an opportunity to shed light on the operation with his direct involvement in the mission as a surgeon-lieutenant in the royal navy volunteer reserve rnvr he recalled stories about his colleagues his training and his feelings about the task
the mediterranean u-boat campaign lasted approximately from 21 september 1941 to may 1944 the kriegsmarine tried to isolate gibraltar malta and suez and disrupt britain's trade routes more than sixty u-boats were sent to interdict allied shipping in the mediterranean sea many of these u-boats were themselves attacked negotiating the strait of gibraltar controlled by britain nine u-boats were sunk while attempting passage and ten more were damaged
plans for the allied counter offensive after the attack on pearl harbor were ongoing by mid-1942 an invasion of europe in 1943 would be unworkable but the allies could attack the soft underbelly of europe through the mediterranean as prime minister winston churchill put it devised by president franklin roosevelt and churchill and code named operation torch the plan was to occupy french north africa morocco algeria and tunisia from these french colonies attacks could be launched that would drive italy out of the war
in july 1942 lieutenant general dwight d. eisenhower was appointed allied commander-in-chief of operation torch churchill placed gibraltar under the command of general eisenhower as the temporary headquarters for this the first large-scale anglo-american operation of the war he arrived in gibraltar on 5 november 1942 to take over not just command of operation torch itself but also military command of gibraltar
general eisenhower stayed at the convent the official governor's residence but his operational headquarters were in a small chamber in a tunnel in the heart of the rock in his memoirs general eisenhower wrote
the subterranean passages under the rock provided the sole available office space and in them was located the signal equipment by which we expected to keep in touch with the commanders of the three assault forces the eternal darkness of the tunnels was here and there partially pierced by feeble electric bulbs damp cold air in block-long passages was heavy with stagnation and did not noticeably respond to the clattering efforts of electric fans through the arched ceilings came a constant drip drip drip of surface water that faithfully but drearily ticked off the seconds of the interminable almost unendurable wait which always occurs between completion of a military plan and the moment action begins
one hundred thousand soldiers on the high seas in a multitude of transports converged on gibraltar more than 400 aircraft of all types were crammed into the dispersal areas around the gibraltar runway fighters had been shipped in crates and assembled on the airfield every available area of storage was taken up with ammunition fuel and other essential supplies 168 american pilots were housed in the raf messes at north front
on 8 november 1942 466 aircraft from gibraltar landed on captured north african airfields
from their headquarters in gibraltar general eisenhower and admiral sir andrew browne cunningham directed operation torch the first major combined combat operation during world war ii involving american and british forces
given that gibraltar was a small town with only a few defences protecting it the solution was to build a massive series of tunnels and chambers inside the natural protection of the rock of gibraltar this town inside the rock contained its own power station water supply and hospital some soldiers posted here would not see the light of day for months on end two canadian engineer companies the only soldiers with diamond-tipped drills and 5 british engineer companies added some 30 miles 48 km of such tunnels a feat thought impossible at the time that was enough to hold all 30,000 troops on the rock today the rock has more underground tunnels than roads
on 4 july 1943 a liberator bomber from raf transport command took off from gibraltar for england on board was general władysław sikorski prime minister of poland's london-based government in exile and commander-in-chief of its armed forces returning from visiting polish troops in the middle east
the aircraft climbed normally from the runway levelled off to gather speed but then suddenly lost height and crashed into the harbour the 62-year-old general died along with 15 others the sole survivor was the czech-born pilot eduard prchal who was rescued by an raf launch the bodies of five passengers and crew including sikorski's daughter were never found
the coffins of general sikorski and his chief-of-staff general kilimecki were draped in the polish national flag and lay in state in the cathedral of st. mary the crowned after a requiem mass the bodies were carried in procession to the h.m. dockyard with full military honours to be shipped to london in anticipation that general sikorski's remains would one day be returned to a liberated poland the route to the dockyard was lined by british troops and the coffins carried and escorted by polish servicemen
in 1943 a british court of inquiry investigated the crash of sikorski's liberator ii al523 but was unable to determine the probable cause finding only that it was an accident and the aircraft became uncontrollable for reasons which cannot be established a popular theory was insufficient technical maintenance leading to jamming aircraft controls despite this finding the political context of the event coupled with a variety of curious circumstances immediately gave rise to speculation that sikorski's death had been no accident and may in fact have been the direct result of a soviet british or even polish conspiracy
the surrender of italy in september 1943 lifted any possible objections to the return of the evacuees to the rock as a result a resettlement board was established in november and at a meeting of the board on 8 february 1944 repatriation priorities were finally agreed on 6 april 1944 the first group of 1,367 repatriates arrived on the rock directly from the united kingdom and on 28 may the first repatriation party left madeira and by the end of 1944 only 520 non-priority evacuees remained on the island
in london home-comers were making claims on the evacuees ’ wartime accommodation and 500 gibraltarians were re-evacuated to scotland and 3,000 to camps in northern ireland although the governor lt. general sir noel mason-macfarlane fought valiantly on behalf of the evacuees and did not accept the lack of accommodation as a sufficient reason for the delays as late as 1947 there were still 2,000 in northern irish camps the last of the evacuees did not see the rock again until 1951
military history of the british commonwealth in the second world war
nerva latin marcus cocceius nerva caesar augustus 8 november 30 ad–27 january 98 ad was roman emperor from 96 to 98 nerva became emperor at the age of sixty-five after a lifetime of imperial service under nero and the rulers of the flavian dynasty under nero he was a member of the imperial entourage and played a vital part in exposing the pisonian conspiracy of 65 later as a loyalist to the flavians he attained consulships in 71 and 90 during the reigns of vespasian and domitian respectively
on 18 september 96 domitian was assassinated in a palace conspiracy involving members of the praetorian guard and several of his freedmen on the same day nerva was declared emperor by the roman senate this was the first time the senate elected a roman emperor as the new ruler of the roman empire he vowed to restore liberties which had been curtailed during the autocratic government of domitian
nerva's brief reign was marred by financial difficulties and his inability to assert his authority over the roman army a revolt by the praetorian guard in october 97 essentially forced him to adopt an heir after some deliberation nerva adopted trajan a young and popular general as his successor after barely fifteen months in office nerva died of natural causes on 27 january 98 upon his death he was succeeded and deified by trajan
although much of his life remains obscure nerva was considered a wise and moderate emperor by ancient historians nerva's greatest success was his ability to ensure a peaceful transition of power after his death thus founding the nerva–antonine dynasty
marcus cocceius nerva was born in the village of narni 50 kilometers north of rome to the family of marcus cocceius nerva suffect consul in 40 and sergia plautilla ancient sources report the date as either 30 or 35 he had at least one attested sister named cocceia who married lucius salvius titianus otho the brother of the future emperor otho
like vespasian the founder of the flavian dynasty nerva was a member of the italian nobility rather than one of the elite of rome nevertheless the cocceii were among the most esteemed and prominent political families of the late republic and early empire attaining consulships in each successive generation the direct ancestors of nerva on his father's side all named marcus cocceius nerva were associated with imperial circles since the time of emperor augustus 27 bc–ad 14
his great-grandfather was consul in 36 bc in replacement and abdicated and governor of asia in the same year his grandfather became consul suffect in july of either 21 or 22 and was known as a personal friend of emperor tiberius ad 14–37 accompanying the emperor during his voluntary seclusion on capri from 23 onwards dying in 33 nerva's father finally attained the consulship in 40 under emperor caligula 37–41 the cocceii were connected with the julio-claudian dynasty through the marriage of sergia plautilla's brother octavius laenas and rubellia bassa the great-granddaughter of tiberius
not much of nerva's early life or career is recorded but it appears he did not pursue the usual administrative or military career he was praetor-elect in the year 65 and like his ancestors moved in imperial circles as a skilled diplomat and strategist as an advisor to emperor nero he successfully helped detect and expose the pisonian conspiracy of 65 exactly what his contribution to the investigation was is not known but his services must have been considerable since they earned him rewards equal to those of nero's guard prefect tigellinus he received triumphal honors — which was usually reserved for military victories — and the right to have his statues placed throughout the palace
according to the contemporary poet martial nero also held nerva's literary abilities in high esteem hailing him as the tibullus of our time another prominent member of nero's entourage was vespasian an old and respected general who had celebrated military triumphs during the 40s it appears vespasian befriended nerva during his time as an imperial advisor and may have asked him to watch over vespasian's youngest son domitian when vespasian departed for the jewish war in 67
the suicide of nero on 9 june 68 brought the julio-claudian dynasty to an end leading to the chaotic year of the four emperors which saw the successive rise and fall of the emperors galba otho and vitellius until the accession of vespasian on 21 december 69 virtually nothing is known of nerva's whereabouts during 69 but despite the fact that otho was his brother-in-law he appears to have been one of the earliest and strongest supporters of the flavians
for services unknown he was rewarded with a consulship early in vespasian's reign in 71 this was a remarkable honour not only because he held this office early under the new regime but also because it was an ordinary consulship instead of a less prestigious suffect consulship making him one of the few non-flavians to be honoured in this way under vespasian after 71 nerva again disappears from historical record presumably continuing his career as an inconspicuous advisor under vespasian 69–79 and his sons titus 79–81 and domitian 81–96
he re-emerges during the revolt of saturninus in 89 on 1 january 89 the governor of germania superior lucius antonius saturninus and his two legions at mainz legio xiv gemina and legio xxi rapax revolted against the roman empire with the aid of a tribe of the chatti the governor of germania inferior lappius maximus moved to the region at once assisted by the procurator of rhaetia titus flavius norbanus within twenty-four days the rebellion was crushed and its leaders at mainz savagely punished the mutinous legions were sent to the front of illyricum while those who had assisted in their defeat were duly rewarded
domitian opened the year following the revolt by sharing the consulship with nerva again the honour suggested nerva had played a part in uncovering the conspiracy perhaps in a fashion similar to what he did during the pisonian conspiracy under nero alternatively domitian may have selected nerva as his colleague to emphasise the stability and status-quo of the regime the revolt had been suppressed and the empire could return to order
on 18 september 96 domitian was assassinated in a palace conspiracy organised by court officials the fasti ostienses the ostian calendar records that the same day the senate proclaimed marcus cocceius nerva emperor despite his political experience this was a remarkable choice nerva was old and childless and had spent much of his career out of the public light prompting both ancient and modern authors to speculate on his involvement in domitian's assassination
according to cassius dio the conspirators approached nerva as a potential successor prior to the assassination which indicates that he was at least aware of the plot suetonius by contrast does not mention nerva but he may have omitted his role out of tactfulness considering the works of suetonius were published under nerva's direct descendants trajan and hadrian it would have been less than sensitive of him to suggest the dynasty owed its accession to murder on the other hand nerva lacked widespread support in the empire and as a known flavian loyalist his track record would not have recommended him to the conspirators the precise facts have been obscured by history but modern historians believe nerva was proclaimed emperor solely on the initiative of the senate within hours after the news of the assassination broke
although he appeared to be an unlikely candidate on account of his age and weak health nerva was considered a safe choice precisely because he was old and childless furthermore he had close connections with the flavian dynasty and commanded the respect of a substantial part of the senate nerva had seen the anarchy which had resulted from the death of nero he knew that to hesitate even for a few hours could lead to violent civil conflict rather than decline the invitation and risk revolts he accepted the decision may have been hasty so as to avoid civil war but neither the senate nor nerva appears to have been involved in the conspiracy against domitian
following the accession of nerva as emperor the senate passed damnatio memoriae on domitian his coins and statues were melted his arches were torn down and his name was erased from all public records in many instances existing portraits of domitian such as those found on the cancelleria reliefs were simply recarved to fit the likeness of nerva this allowed quick production of new images and recycling of previous material in addition the vast palace which domitian had erected on the palatine hill known as the flavian palace was renamed the house of the people and nerva himself took up residence in vespasian's former villa in the gardens of sallust
the change of government was welcome particularly to the senators who had been harshly persecuted during domitian's reign as an immediate gesture of goodwill towards his supporters nerva publicly swore that no senators would be put to death as long as he remained in office he called an end to trials based on treason released those who had been imprisoned under these charges and granted amnesty to many who had been exiled
all properties which had been confiscated by domitian were returned to their respective families nerva also sought to involve the senate in his government but this was not entirely successful he continued to rely largely on friends and advisors that were known and trusted and by maintaining friendly relations with the pro-domitianic faction of the senate he incurred hostility which may have been the cause for at least one conspiracy against his life
having been proclaimed emperor solely on the initiative of the senate nerva had to introduce a number of measures to gain support among the roman populace as was custom by this time a change of emperor was expected to bring with it a generous payment of gifts and money to the people and the army accordingly a congiarium of 75 denarii per head was bestowed upon the citizens while the soldiers of the praetorian guard received a donativum which may have amounted to as much as 5000 denarii per person this was followed by a string of economic reforms intended to alleviate the burden of taxation from the most needy romans
to the poorest nerva granted allotments of land worth up to 60 million sesterces he exempted parents and their children from a 5 inheritance tax and he made loans to italian landowners on the condition that they pay interest of 5 to their municipality to support the children of needy families alimentary schemes which were later expanded by trajan antoninus pius and marcus aurelius furthermore numerous taxes were remitted and privileges granted to roman provinces namely he probably abolished the fiscus iudaicus the additional tax which all jews throughout the empire had to pay some of his coins bear the legend fisci iudaici calumnia sublata abolition of malicious prosecution regarding the jewish tax
before long nerva's expenses strained the economy of rome and although perhaps not ruinous to the extent once suggested by syme necessitated the formation of a special commission of economy to drastically reduce expenditures the most superfluous religious sacrifices games and horse races were abolished while new income was generated from domitian's former possessions including the auctioning of ships estates and even furniture large amounts of money were obtained from domitian's silver and gold statues and nerva forbade that similar images be made in his honor
because he reigned only briefly nerva's public works were few instead completing projects which had been initiated under flavian rule this included extensive repairs to the roman road system and the expansion of the aqueducts the latter program was headed by the former consul sextus julius frontinus who helped to put an end to abuses and later published a significant work on rome's water supply de aquis urbis romae the only major landmarks constructed under nerva were a granary known as the horrea nervae and a small imperial forum begun by domitian which linked the forum of augustus to the temple of peace little remains partly because the via dei fori imperiali cuts across it
despite nerva's measures to remain popular with the senate and the roman people support for domitian remained strong in the army which had called for his deification immediately after the assassination in an attempt to appease the soldiers of the praetorian guard nerva had dismissed their prefect titus petronius secundus — one of the chief conspirators against domitian — and replaced him with a former commander casperius aelianus
likewise the generous donativum bestowed upon the soldiers following his accession was expected to swiftly silence any protests against the violent regime change the praetorians considered these measures insufficient however and demanded the execution of domitian's assassins which nerva refused continued dissatisfaction with this state of affairs would ultimately lead to the gravest crisis of nerva's reign
while the swift transfer of power following domitian's death had prevented a civil war from erupting nerva's position as an emperor soon proved too vulnerable and his benign nature turned into a reluctance to assert his authority upon his accession he had ordered a halt to treason trials but at the same time allowed the prosecution of informers by the senate to continue this measure led to chaos as everyone acted in his own interests while trying to settle scores with personal enemies leading the consul fronto to famously remark that domitian's tyranny was ultimately preferable to nerva's anarchy early in 97 a conspiracy led by the senator gaius calpurnius piso crassus frugi licinianus failed but once again nerva refused to put the conspirators to death much to the disapproval of the senate
the situation was further aggravated by the absence of a clear successor made more pressing because of nerva's old age and sickness he had no natural children of his own and only distant relatives who were unsuited for political office a successor would have to be chosen from among the governors or generals in the empire and it appears that by 97 nerva was considering to adopt marcus cornelius nigrinus curiatius maternus the powerful governor of syria this was covertly opposed by those who supported the more popular military commander marcus ulpius traianus commonly known as trajan a general of the armies at the german frontier
in october 97 these tensions came to a head when the praetorian guard led by casperius aelianus laid siege to the imperial palace and took nerva hostage he was forced to submit to their demands agreeing to hand over those responsible for domitian's death and even giving a speech thanking the rebellious praetorians titus petronius secundus and parthenius domitian's former chamberlain were sought out and killed nerva was unharmed in this assault but his authority was damaged beyond repair
he realized that his position was no longer tenable without the support of an heir who had the approval of both the army and the people shortly thereafter he announced the adoption of trajan as his successor and with this decision all but abdicated trajan was formally bestowed with the title of caesar and shared the consulship with nerva in 98
contrary to the view here popularized by cassius dio however nerva had in fact little choice with regard to his successor faced with a major crisis he desperately needed the support of a man who could restore his damaged reputation the only candidate with sufficient military experience consular ancestry and connections was trajan likewise edward gibbon's assertion that nerva hereby established a tradition of succession through adoption among the five good emperors has found little support among modern historians
on 1 january 98 at the start of his fourth consulship nerva suffered a stroke during a private audience shortly thereafter he was struck by a fever and died at his villa in the gardens of sallust on 28 january he was deified by the senate and his ashes were laid to rest in the mausoleum of augustus
nerva was succeeded without incident by his adopted son trajan who was greeted by the roman populace with much enthusiasm according to pliny the younger trajan dedicated a temple in honour of nerva yet no trace of it has ever been found nor was a commemorative series of coins for the deified nerva issued until ten years after his death according to cassius dio however the guard prefect responsible for the mutiny against nerva casperius aelianus was'dismissed'upon trajan's accession
due to the lack of written sources on this period much of nerva's life has remained obscure the most substantial surviving account of the reign of nerva was written by the 3rd-century historian cassius dio his roman history which spans nearly a millennium from the arrival of aeneas in italy until the year 229 was composed more than one hundred years after nerva had died further details are added by an abridged biography from the epitome de caesaribus a work alleged to have been authored by the 4th-century historian aurelius victor
a more comprehensive text presumed to describe the life of nerva in closer detail is the histories by the contemporary historian tacitus the histories is an account of the history of rome covering three decades from the suicide of emperor nero in 69 until the death of domitian in 96 unfortunately a substantial part of the work has been lost with only the first five books covering the year of the four emperors remaining in the introduction to his biography of gnaeus julius agricola however tacitus speaks highly of nerva describing his reign as the dawn of a most happy age when nerva caesar blended things once irreconcilable sovereignty and freedom
the surviving histories speak equally positively of nerva's brief reign although none offer a substantial commentary on his policies both cassius dio and aurelius victor emphasize his wisdom and moderation with dio commending his decision to adopt trajan as his heir these views were later popularized by the 18th-century historian edward gibbon in his history of the decline and fall of the roman empire gibbon considered nerva the first of the five good emperors five successive rulers under whom the roman empire was governed by absolute power under the guidance of wisdom and virtue from 96 until 180 nevertheless even gibbon notes that compared to his successors nerva may have lacked the necessary qualifications for a successful reign
modern history has expanded upon this sentiment characterizing nerva as a well-intentioned but weak and ineffectual ruler the roman senate enjoyed renewed liberties under his rule but nerva's mismanagement of the state finances and lack of authority over the army ultimately brought rome near the edge of a significant crisis the mutiny led by casperius aelianus was never intended as a coup but a calculated attempt to put pressure on the emperor the adoption of trajan expanded his power base with a respected reliable general as his successor murison concludes that nerva's real talents were in fact ill-suited to the emperorship
his place in roman history is therefore summarized as a necessary if tumultuous stop-gap before the trajanic-antonine dynasties it is a fact of irony that even the only major public work completed during his reign the forum of nerva ultimately became known as the forum transitorium or transitional forum
two modern statues which commemorate nerva can be found in towns associated with him there is an equestrian statue in gloucester england a town which was founded in his honour it is at the entrance to southgate street there is also a statue at his alleged birthplace narni in italy at cocceio nerva street
nerva was played by norman wooland in the 1951 film quo vadis
he was also played by giuliano gemma in the 1964 film revolt of the praetorians

eddie humiliates a local pool shark exposing himself as a hustler and the other players punish him by breaking his thumbs as he heals sarah cares for him and tells him she loves him but he cannot say the words in return when eddie is ready to play he agrees to bert's terms deciding that a 25 slice of something big is better than a 100 slice of nothing

cast notes
pool champion willie mosconi has a cameo appearance as willie who holds the stakes for eddie and fats's games mosconi's hands also appear in many of the closeup shots
the tevis novel had been optioned several times including by frank sinatra but attempts to adapt it for the screen were unsuccessful director rossen's daughter carol rossen speculates that previous adaptations focused too much on the pool aspects of the story and not enough on the human interaction rossen who had hustled pool himself as a youth and who had made an abortive attempt to write a pool-themed play called corner pocket optioned the book and teamed with sidney carroll to produce the script
according to bobby darin's agent martin baum paul newman's agent turned down the part of fast eddie newman was originally unavailable to play fast eddie regardless being committed to star opposite elizabeth taylor in the film two for the seesaw rossen offered darin the part after seeing him on the mike wallace interview when taylor was forced to drop out of seesaw because of shooting overruns on cleopatra newman was freed up to take the role which he accepted after reading just half of the script no one associated with the production officially notified darin or his representatives that he had been replaced they found out from a member of the public at a charity horse race
rossen filmed the hustler over six weeks entirely in new york city much of the action was filmed at two now-defunct pool halls mcgirr's and ames billiard academy other shooting locations included a townhouse on east 82nd street which served as the louisville home of murray hamilton's character findley and the manhattan greyhound bus terminal the film crew built a dining area that was so realistic that confused passengers sat there and waited to place their orders willie mosconi served as technical advisor on the film and shot a number of the trick shots in place of the actors all of gleason's shots were his own they were filmed in wide-angle to emphasize having the actor and the shot in the same frames rossen in pursuit of the style he termed neo-neo-realistic hired actual street thugs enrolled them in the screen actors guild and used them as extras scenes that were included in the shooting script but did not make it into the final film include a scene at ames pool hall establishing that eddie is on his way to town originally slated to be the first scene of the film and a longer scene of preacher talking to bert at johnny's bar which establishes preacher is a junkie
early shooting put more focus on the pool playing but during filming rossen made the decision to place more emphasis on the love story between newman and laurie's characters despite the change in emphasis rossen still used the various pool games to show the strengthening of eddie's character and the evolution of his relationship to bert and sarah through the positioning of the characters in the frame for example when eddie is playing findley eddie is positioned below bert in a two shot but above findley while still below bert in a three shot when sarah enters the room she is below eddie in two shot while in a three shot eddie is still below bert when eddie is kneeling over sarah's body bert again appears above him but eddie attacks bert ending up on top of him eddie finally appears above bert in two shot when eddie returns to beat fats
the hustler is fundamentally a story of what it means to be a human being couched within the context of winning and losing describing the film robert rossen said my protagonist fast eddie wants to become a great pool player but the film is really about the obstacles he encounters in attempting to fulfill himself as a human being he attains self-awareness only after a terrible personal tragedy which he has caused — and then he wins his pool game roger ebert concurs with this assessment citing the hustler as one of the few american movies in which the hero wins by surrendering by accepting reality instead of his dreams
the film was also somewhat autobiographical for rossen relating to his dealings with the house un-american activities committee a screenwriter during the 1930s and'40s he had been involved with the communist party in the 1930s and refused to name names at his first huac appearance ultimately he changed his mind and identified friends and colleagues as party members similarly felson sells his soul and betrays the one person who really knows and loves him in a faustian pact to gain character
film and theatre historian ethan mordden has identified the hustler as one of a handful of films from the early 1960s that re-defined the relationship of films to their audiences this new relationship he writes is one of challenge rather than flattery of doubt rather than certainty no film of the 1950s mordden asserts took such a brutal clear look at the ego-affirmation of the one-on-one contest at the inhumanity of the winner or the castrated vulnerability of the loser although some have suggested the resemblance of this film to classic film noir mordden rejects the comparison based on rossen's ultra-realistic style also noting that the film lacks noir's treacherous woman or its relish in discovering crime among the bourgeoisie hungry bank clerks and lusty wives mordden does note that while fast eddie has a slight fifties ring the character makes a decisive break with the extraordinarily feeling tough guys of the'rebel'era ... b ut he does end up seeking out his emotions and telling bert that he is a loser because he's dead inside
the hustler had its world premiere in washington d.c. on september 25 1961 prior to the premiere richard burton hosted a midnight screening of the film for the casts of the season's broadway shows which generated a great deal of positive word of mouth initially reluctant to publicize the film 20th century fox responded by stepping up its promotional activities
the film was well received by critics although with the occasional caveat variety praised the performances of the entire main cast but felt that the sordid aspects of the story prevented the film from achieving the goal of being pure entertainment variety also felt the film was far too long stanley kauffmann writing for the new republic concurred in part with this assessment kauffmann strongly praised the principal cast calling newman first-rate and writing that scott's was his most credible performance to date laurie he writes gives her part movingly anguished touches although he also mildly criticizes her for over-reliance on method acting while he found that the script strains hard to give an air of menace and criminality to the pool hall and also declares it full of pseudo-meaning kauffmann lauds rossen's sure economical direction especially in regard to gleason who he says does not so much act as pose for a number of pictures which are well arranged by rossen it is the best use of a manikin by a director since kazan photographed burl ives as big daddy the new york times despite finding that the film strays a bit and that the romance between newman and laurie's characters seems a mite far-fetched nonetheless found that the hustler speaks powerfully in a universal language that spellbinds and reveals bitter truths
the hustler received nine academy award nominations the film won two for best art direction-set decoration black-and-white harry horner and gene callahan and best cinematography black-and-white eugen schüfftan the film was also nominated for best picture and newman was nominated for best actor in a leading role gleason and scott were both nominated for best actor in a supporting role scott refused the nomination laurie was nominated for best actress in a leading role rossen received nominations for best director and with carroll for best writing screenplay based on material from another medium
newman was nominated for a golden globe award for best actor gleason and scott were each nominated for best supporting actor and scott was also nominated as best new star of the year at the 1962 bafta awards the hustler tied with the soviet film ballad of a soldier for best film from any source newman won for best foreign actor and piper laurie was nominated for best foreign actress gleason was honored as best supporting actor by the national board of review of motion pictures and the film was named among the board's ten best films of 1961 rossen was named best director by the new york film critics circle awards and rossen and carroll shared the writers guild of america award for best written drama

in the decades since its release the hustler has cemented its reputation as a classic roger ebert echoing earlier praise for the performances direction and cinematography and adding laurels for editor dede allen cites the film as one of those films where scenes have such psychic weight that they grow in our memories he further cites fast eddie felson as one of only a handful of movie characters so real that the audience refers to them as touchstones tv guide calls the film a dark stunner offering a grim world whose only bright spot is the top of the pool table yet with characters who maintain a shabby nobility and grace the four leads are again lavishly praised for their performances and the film is summed up as not to be missed
paul newman reprised his role as fast eddie felson in the 1986 film the color of money for which he won the academy award for best actor in a leading role a number of observers and critics have suggested that this oscar was in belated recognition for his performance in the hustler in 1997 the library of congress selected the hustler for preservation in the united states national film registry as culturally historically or aesthetically significant carroll and rossen's screenplay was selected by the writers guild of america in 2006 as the 96th best motion picture screenplay of all time in june 2008 afi released its ten top ten — the best ten films in ten classic american film genres — after polling over 1,500 people from the creative community the hustler was acknowledged as the sixth best film in the sports genre
the hustler is credited with sparking a resurgence in the popularity of pool in the united states which had been on the decline for decades the film also brought recognition to willie mosconi who despite having won multiple world championships was virtually unknown to the general public perhaps the greatest beneficiary of the film's popularity was a real-life pool hustler named rudolf wanderone mosconi claimed in an interview at the time of the film's release that the character of minnesota fats was based on wanderone who at the time was known as new york fatty wanderone immediately adopted the minnesota fats nickname and parlayed his association with the film into book and television deals and other ventures author walter tevis denied for the rest of his life that wanderone had played any role in the creation of the character other players would claim with greater or lesser degrees of credibility to have served as models for fast eddie including ronnie allen ed taylor ed parker and eddie pelkey
